<text>Grajewo (; ) is a town in north-eastern Poland with 21,499 inhabitants (2016). It is the capital of Grajewo County within the Podlaskie Voivodeship. It is located within the historic region of Masovia, near the border with Podlachia and Masuria.

==History==
At one time, the area was inhabited by the Yotvingians.

===Kingdom of Poland===
The first settlements in the region of modern Grajewo already existed in the early 15th century. The first documented mention is from the year 1426. In the late 15th century the village was a small center of trade and crafts. In 1540 the town obtained municipal rights from Polish King Sigismund I the Old. In 1656, during the Deluge (Polish-Swedish war), the Battle of Prostki took place nearby. The town&#x27;s population decreased dramatically as a result of the war. In 1692 the town came into the possession of the Wilczewski family, hailing from Wilczewo. In 1794 battles of the Polish Kościuszko Uprising were fought near Grajewo. In 1777, the town had 258 inhabitants, and in 1800 it had 218 inhabitants.

===Partitions of Poland===
During the retreat after the French invasion of Russia, Napoleon stopped in the town in December 1812. After the Partitions of Poland by the neighbouring empires, in 1815 Grajewo became part of Russian Congress Poland. In 1831 victorious battles of the November Uprising took place near Grajewo. In the second half of the 19th century, trade and handicrafts developed. After the massacres of Polish protesters committed by the Russians in Warsaw in 1861, Polish demonstrations and clashes with Russian soldiers took place in Grajewo. During the January Uprising, on March 12, 1864, a clash between Polish insurgents and Russian troops took place near the town, won by Poles. Due to the participation of the population in the January Uprising, the town lost its municipal rights in 1870. With the establishment of a rail link between the then-German-controlled city of Ełk and the then-Russian-controlled city of Białystok, the town&#x27;s development was accelerated.

A Jewish community existed in Grajewo from the late 18th century. As a result of the discriminatory Russian regulations (Pale of Settlement), at times Jews formed a majority of the town population. In 1808, 197 Jews lived in the town, 39% of the total population. In 1827 they made up a majority, with 57% of the population. In 1857 the percentage rose to 76% and in 1897 over 4,000 Jews lived in the town. During World War I the town was occupied by Germany. During the war a large part of the town was destroyed.

===Interwar Poland===

Following the war, the town became part of the re-established Polish state, the Second Polish Republic, and was granted municipal rights again on July 4, 1919. Between the world wars, Grajewo was the seat of a district office and had around 9,500 inhabitants. New schools were established in Grajewo in 1919 and 1931.

Following the war, the Jewish population fell sharply. According to the 1921 census, the population was 60.9% Polish and 38.5% Jewish.

The highest Polish dignitaries visited Grajewo in the interwar period: Marshal Józef Piłsudski in 1921, President Stanisław Wojciechowski in 1925 and President Ignacy Mościcki in 1929.

===World War II===
The pre-war population of 9,500 included 3,000 Jews. The Germans occupied the town for three weeks from 6–7 September 1939. During the German occupation the synagogue and Bet Midrash were burned down by Germans and 300 Jewish men were deported to a forced labor camp in East Prussia. The town was then handed over to the Soviet Union. The Soviets deported many Polish inhabitants, especially the intelligentsia, military, policemen, foresters, officials, wealthier merchants, farmers and craftsmen and their families, to the Far North (Arctic Circle), Siberia and Kazakhstan.
On June 22, 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, German border guards shelled the town and then occupied it, setting up a military command post in the town. Adult Jews were employed in forced labor by the Germans. On 29 June 1941, following Sunday mass, local Polish anti-Semites carried out a pogrom killing 10 Jews and injuring dozens of others. However the next day on 30 June the Jews of the town were assembled at the market square by the German Gestapo and the Polish perpetrators of the pogrom were asked to identify communists who were then brutally beaten. 300 Jews, alleged communists, were arrested and placed in the old Synagogue. The Germans executed the survivors in August.

According to survivor testimony only some 1,600 of the 3,000 Jews of the town survived in August, and they were placed in a ghetto. On 2 November 1942 the SS surrounded the ghetto, and drove out the Jewish inhabitants to a transit camp in the village of Bogusze. From there they were sent to Treblinka extermination camp and Auschwitz concentration camp and most of them were murdered on arrival.

In July 1941, the Germans established a camp, which served both as a penal forced labour camp and a transit camp for Poles deported either to forced labour in Germany or to the Stutthof concentration camp. Around 3,500 people passed through it. In autumn of 1941, the occupiers established another transit camp for people deported from various regions to forced labour in Germany. The camp could accommodate about 1,000 people at a time. Some ill people were sent from it to the Majdanek concentration camp.

On July 15, 1943, in the Kosówka forest, the German gendarmerie in cooperation with the Gestapo murdered about 150 Poles, most of them inhabitants of Grajewo. On January 20, 1945, the Germans committed another mass murder in the Kosówka forest, killing 300 Polish inhabitants of the town. Five Polish Girl Scouts were murdered by the Germans in Grajewo.

The Red Army marched into Grajewo on January 23, 1945. According to data from 1945, 5,366 inhabitants of the Grajewo county lost their life during the war, only 163 in military operations, 5,009 as a result of the crimes of the occupiers. About 3000 of the deaths were of the town&#x27;s Jewish population; only a few dozen survived. About 30% of the town was destroyed. It was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.

=== Post-war period ===

On May 8, 1945, the anti-communist Home Army seized the buildings of the communist Public Security in Grajewo and freed over 100 prisoners.

In 1967, the Dairy Plant in Grajewo was established. Over time, as &quot;Mlekpol&quot;, it became one of the largest dairy cooperatives in Poland. In 2016, the first Milk Museum in Poland was opened in Grajewo.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Łomża Voivodeship. In 1990, the Independence Monument was unveiled in the city center.

In 2000, President Aleksander Kwaśniewski visited Grajewo. A few years later, in 2006, Grajewo was visited by Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński, whose father was born in the town.

<text>Zambrów is a town in northeastern Poland with 21,166 inhabitants (2020). It is the capital of Zambrów County. Situated in the Podlaskie Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Łomża Voivodeship (1975–1998).

==History==

The name of the town comes from the term &quot;ząbr&quot;, which means a place where &quot;żubry&quot; (European bison) gather.
The first mention of the town comes from 1283, during which the town was the property of the Masovian Dukes of the Piast dynasty within fragmented Poland, and it got its city laws (Chełmno law) in 1430. The greatest development of the city came during the 15th and 16th centuries. The mid-17th-century Swedish Deluge brought an end to the prosperity of the city as much of it was destroyed.

It was annexed by Prussia in the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. In 1807 it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution in 1815, it fell to the Russian Partition of Poland. During both the January and November Uprising against Russia, the area was witness to battles against Russian forces. Zambrów was also the site of Polish demonstrations and clashes with Russian soldiers after the massacres of Polish protesters committed by the Russians in Warsaw in 1861. As a result of persecutions by the Tsarist regime, the city was deprived of its city rights in 1870, and two Russian regiments of infantry were stationed in the town. Throughout World War I the area again faced much destruction. The Polish 1st Legion&#x27;s Infantry Regiment under the command of Edward Rydz-Śmigły was stationed in the town during 1917. After Poland regained its independence, city rights were restored in 1919. During the inter-war years the city was linked to the military: the 71st Infantry Regiment was stationed there and the town was home to a military school.

===World War II===
In 1939 the population of the town was over 7,000 people, over half of them Jews - many of whom had populated the town in the late 19th century from neighboring Jewish communities in the Łomża gubernya, such as Jablonka Koscielna. Between the 10 and 13 September the area was the fighting ground of the Polish 18th Infantry Division commanded by Colonel Stefan Kossecki and German XIX Panzer Corps under the command of General Guderian.

Polish soldiers from the 33rd, 71st, and 42nd Infantry regiments were taken prisoner. They were then taken from the square to the city barracks which were used for exercises. On September 13, 1939 the number of Polish PoWs was about 4,000. In the corners of the square machine guns were put on cars, and behind them horses were kept that belonged to the Polish unit. During the night, light reflectors were beamed upon the square. On the nights of the 13th and 14 September when Polish prisoners started to lie down to sleep, the German captors informed them that anybody that on that night who tried to rise or move from his place would be shot on the spot. After that information horses stormed the square, trampling the sleeping soldiers on the ground. In panic many Poles tried to escape, but the Germans immediately opened fire with machine guns into the crowd: this lasted over 10 minutes and ended only when some German soldiers were wounded by mistake. When the shooting stopped, the Germans again informed the Polish POWs that no movement was allowed. Throughout the night, the wounded and dying were crying for help, but no medical assistance was given. In the morning there were 200 dead and 100 wounded. This event came to be known as the Zambrów massacre. According to the witness reports the horses were either driven by the Germans or blinded by the reflector lights.

Afterwards, the town was handed over by Germany to the Soviet Union in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. It was under Soviet occupation until 1941. The Soviets destroyed a pre-war monument to the fallen Polish insurgents of the January Uprising.

The town passed under German occupation following the Operation Barbarossa. During the occupation a ghetto was established for the Zambrów Jews by German authorities. At that time the Germans killed 800 Jews in the city, including community dignitaries, at the Glmbokih forest nearby. Jews were transferred to the city&#x27;s ghetto from Moisokh Mazowiecki. At the beginning of September 1941 hundreds of Jews found &quot;unfit for work&quot;, including the elderly and pregnant women, were killed at the nearby Rothke-Koski woods. In the second half of 1942 the city&#x27;s ghetto accepted Jews from Czyżew, and they were employed as forced labour. In early November 1942 all the residents of the ghetto were transferred to an abandoned military camp, where some 14,000 to 17,000 Jews from the environment were concentrated in very harsh living conditions. In January 1943, all of them were sent to Auschwitz death camp, while 500 to 800 Jews were murdered during the action, and the rest were murdered in the gas chambers.

In 1941, the Germans also established a forced labour camp for local Poles in Zambrów. The camp housed around 60 people at a time, and a total of around 2,000 people passed through it, before it was dissolved in August 1944.

When the war ended the population of the town was 4,130 out of 7,620. According to rough estimates, war destruction reached 43%. In 1944, the town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. In 1993, the pre-war monument to the fallen Polish insurgents of the January Uprising of 1863–1864 was rebuilt.

<text>In computer science, a NOP, no-op, or NOOP (pronounced &quot;no op&quot;; short for no operation) is a machine language instruction and its assembly language mnemonic, programming language statement, or computer protocol command that does nothing.

== Machine language instructions ==
Some computer instruction sets include an instruction whose explicit purpose is to not change the state of any of the programmer-accessible registers, status flags, or memory. It often takes a well-defined number of clock cycles to execute. In other instruction sets, there is no explicit NOP instruction, but the assembly language mnemonic NOP represents an instruction which acts as a NOP; e.g., on the SPARC, codice_1.

A NOP must not access memory, as that could cause a memory fault or page fault. 

A NOP is most commonly used for timing purposes, to force memory alignment, to prevent hazards, to occupy a branch delay slot, to render void an existing instruction such as a jump, as a target of an execute instruction, or as a place-holder to be replaced by active instructions later on in program development (or to replace removed instructions when reorganizing would be problematic or time-consuming). In some cases, a NOP can have minor side effects; for example, on the Motorola 68000 series of processors, the NOP opcode causes a synchronization of the pipeline.

Listed below are the NOP instruction for some CPU architectures:

From a hardware design point of view, unmapped areas of a bus are often designed to return zeroes; since the NOP slide behavior is often desirable, it gives a bias to coding it with the all-zeroes opcode.

== Code ==
A function or a sequence of programming language statements is a NOP or null statement if it has no effect. Null statements may be required by the syntax of some languages in certain contexts.

=== Ada ===
In Ada, the codice_2 statement serves as a NOP. As the syntax forbids that control statements or functions be empty, the codice_2 statement must be used to specify that no action is required. (Thus, if the programmer forgets to write a sequence of statements, the program will fail to compile.)

=== C and derivatives ===
The simplest NOP statement in C is the &quot;null statement&quot;, which is just a semi-colon in a context requiring a statement.

Most C compilers generate no code for null statements, which has historical and performance reasons. 
An empty block (compound statement) is also a NOP, and may be more legible, but will still have no code generated for it by the compiler.
In some cases, such as the body of a function, a block must be used, but this can be empty. In C, statements cannot be empty—simple statements must end with a codice_4 (semicolon) while compound statements are enclosed in codice_5 (braces), which does not itself need a following semicolon. Thus in contexts where a statement is grammatically required, some such null statement can be used.

The null statement is useless by itself, but it can have a syntactic use in a wider context, e.g., within the context of a loop:

 while (getchar() != &#x27;\n&#x27;) {}

alternatively,
 while (getchar() != &#x27;\n&#x27;)

or more tersely:
 while (getchar() != &#x27;\n&#x27;);

(note that the last form may be confusing, and as such generates a warning with some compilers or compiler options, as semicolon usually indicates an end of function call instruction when placed after a parenthesis on the end of line).

The above code continues calling the function codice_6 until it returns a codice_7 (newline) character, essentially fast-forwarding the current reading location of standard input to the beginning of next line.

=== Fortran ===
In Fortran, the codice_8 statement is used in some contexts such as the last statement in a DO loop, although it can be used anywhere, and does not have any functionality.

=== JavaScript ===
The JavaScript language does not have a built-in NOP statement. Many implementations are possible:
* Use the codice_4 &quot;empty statement&quot; or the codice_5 empty &quot;block statement&quot; the same way as in the C and derivatives examples;
* Use the codice_11 or the codice_2 expression as a complete statement (an &quot;expression statement&quot;) when the previous methods are not allowed by the syntax.
Alternatives, in situations where a function is required, are:
* Use the codice_13 built-in function, that accepts any arguments and returns codice_11;
* Use a NOP function available in a third-party library —see below;
* Define a custom NOP function, as in the following example (using the ES6 arrow function syntax):
const noop = () =&gt; {};

==== AngularJS ====
The AngularJS framework provides angular.noop function that performs no operations.

==== jQuery ====
The jQuery library provides a function codice_15, which does nothing.

==== Lodash ====
The Lodash library provides a function codice_16, which returns undefined and does nothing.

=== Pascal ===
As with C, the ; used by itself can be used as a null statement in Pascal. In fact, due to the specification of the language, in a BEGIN / END block, the semicolon is optional before the END statement, thus a semicolon used there is superfluous. 

Also, a block consisting of codice_17 may be used as a placeholder to indicate no action, even if placed inside another BEGIN / END block.

=== Python ===
The Python programming language has a codice_18 statement which has no effect when executed and thus serves as a NOP. It is primarily used to ensure correct syntax due to Python&#x27;s indentation-sensitive syntax; for example the syntax for definition of a class requires an indented block with the class logic, which has to be expressed as codice_18 when it should be empty.

=== Shell scripting (bash, zsh, etc.) ===
The &#x27;codice_20&#x27; [colon] command is a shell builtin that has similar effect to a &quot;NOP&quot; (a do-nothing operation). It is not technically an NOP, as it changes the special parameter $? (exit status of last command) to 0. It may be considered a synonym for the shell builtin &#x27;true&#x27;, and its exit status is true (0).

=== TeX macro language (ConTeXt, LaTeX, etc.) ===
The TeX typographical system&#x27;s macro language has the codice_21 command. It does nothing by itself, but may be used to prevent the immediately preceding command from parsing any subsequent tokens.

== NOP protocol commands ==
Many computer protocols, such as telnet, include a NOP command that a client can issue to request a response from the server without requesting any other actions. Such a command can be used to ensure the connection is still alive or that the server is responsive. A NOOP command is part of the following protocols (&quot;this is a partial list&quot;):
* telnet
* FTP
* SMTP
* X11
* POP3
* NNTP
* finger
* IMAP4
* BitTorrent

Note that unlike the other protocols listed, the IMAP4 NOOP command has a specific purpose—it allows the server to send any pending notifications to the client.

While most telnet or FTP servers respond to a NOOP command with &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;+OK&quot;, some programmers have added quirky responses to the client. For example, the codice_22 daemon of MINIX responds to NOOP with the message:
 200 NOOP to you too!

== Cracking ==
NOPs are often involved when cracking software that checks for serial numbers, specific hardware or software requirements, presence or absence of hardware dongles, etc. in the form of a NOP slide. This process is accomplished by altering functions and subroutines to bypass security checks and instead simply return the expected value being checked for. Because most of the instructions in the security check routine will be unused, these would be replaced with NOPs, thus removing the software&#x27;s security functionality without altering the positioning of everything which follows in the binary.

== Security exploits ==
The NOP opcode can be used to form a NOP slide, which allows code to execute when the exact value of the instruction pointer is indeterminate (e.g., when a buffer overflow causes a function&#x27;s return address on the stack to be overwritten).

<text>Nikolaus Lenau was the pen name of Nikolaus Franz Niembsch Edler von Strehlenau (13 August 1802 – 22 August 1850), a German-language Austrian poet.

==Biography==

He was born at Csatád (Schadat), Kingdom of Hungary, now Lenauheim, Banat, then part of the Habsburg monarchy, now in Romania. His father, a Habsburg government official, died in 1807 in Budapest, leaving his children in the care of their mother, who remarried in 1811. In 1819 Nikolaus went to the University of Vienna; he subsequently studied Hungarian law at Pozsony (Bratislava) and then spent the next four years qualifying himself in medicine. Unable to settle down to any profession, he began writing verse. The disposition to sentimental melancholy inherited from his mother, stimulated by disappointments in love and by the prevailing fashion of the romantic school of poetry, descended into gloom after his mother&#x27;s death in 1829.

Soon afterwards, however, a legacy from his grandmother enabled him to devote himself wholly to poetry. His first published poems appeared in 1827, in Johann Gabriel Seidl&#x27;s &quot;Aurora&quot;. In 1831 he moved to Stuttgart, where he published a volume of &quot;Gedichte&quot; (1832) dedicated to the Swabian poet, Gustav Schwab. He also made the acquaintance of Ludwig Uhland, Justinus Kerner, Karl Mayer and others. His restless spirit longed for change, and he determined to seek peace and freedom in America.

In October 1832 he landed at Baltimore and settled on a homestead in Ohio. He also lived six months in New Harmony, Indiana, with a group called the Harmony Society. Life in the primeval forest fell lamentably short of the ideal he had pictured. He disliked Americans with their eternal English lisping of dollars (&quot;englisches Talergelispel&quot;), and in 1833 returned to Germany. The appreciation of his first volume of poems revived his spirits.

From then on he lived partly in Stuttgart and partly in Vienna. In 1836 his &quot;Faust&quot; appeared, in which he laid bare his own soul to the world; in 1837, &quot;Savonarola&quot;, an epic in which freedom from political and intellectual tyranny as an essential component of Christianity was stated. In 1838 his &quot;Neuere Gedichte&quot; proved that &quot;Savonarola&quot; had been the result of a passing exaltation. Of these new poems, some of the finest were inspired by his hopeless passion for Sophie von Löwenthal, the wife of a friend. In 1842 appeared &quot;Die Albigenser&quot;, and in 1844 he began writing his &quot;Don Juan&quot;, a fragment of which was published after his death.

Soon afterwards he developed signs of mental ill-health. In October 1844, he jumped from a window one morning and ran down a street shouting &quot;Revolt! Freedom! Help! Fire!&quot;. He was placed in an asylum, under restraint, for the remainder of his life. He died in the asylum at Oberdöbling near Vienna and was buried in the cemetery of Weidling, near Klosterneuburg. On his grave is the replica of an open book with an extract from one of his poems (&quot;An Frau Kleyle&quot;) inscribed on the left-hand page, while on the right-hand page there is the final stanza from his poem &quot;Vergangenheit&quot;. The city of Stockerau in Lower Austria has proclaimed itself &quot;Lenau City&quot;, because Nikolaus Lenau went on extensive walks in the alluvial forests next to Stockerau and the Danube and was inspired to write one of his most famous lyric poems, &quot;Schilflieder&quot;, during this time. He has various streets and squares in Vienna and the surrounding area named after him.

His political poems, such as &quot;By the Grave of a Minister,&quot; reveal Lenau&#x27;s liberal sympathies with their attacks on the despotism of Metternich&#x27;s reactionary system and the alleged corruption of the Catholic Church. Lenau&#x27;s fame rests mainly upon his shorter poems; even his epics are essentially lyric in quality. His excellent poem, &quot;Herbst&quot;, expresses the sadness and melancholy he felt after his sojourn in the United States and his strenuous travels across the Atlantic to return to Europe. In it, he mourns the loss of youth, the passing of time and his own sense of futility. The poem is archetypal of Lenau&#x27;s style and culminates with the speaker dreaming of death as a final escape from emptiness. He is the greatest modern lyric poet of Austria, and the typical representative in German literature of that pessimistic &quot;Weltschmerz&quot; which, beginning with Lord Byron, reached its culmination in the poetry of Giacomo Leopardi.

Lenau&#x27;s &quot;Sämtliche Werke&quot; were first published in 4 vols. by Anastasius Grün in 1855, but there are several more modern editions, as those by Max Koch in Joseph Kürschner&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Nationalliteratur&quot; of 1888 (vols. 154 and 155), and E. Castle (2 vols., 1900). 

==Legacy==
* Composer Marie Schauff (fl. 1799-1844) set Lenau’s poems to music in her “Gedichte von Lenau” opus 3.
* Robert Schumann, whom Lenau met in 1829, set six of his poems in the &quot;Sechs Gedichte und Requiem&quot;, Op. 90. The cycle was composed in 1850; Lenau died on the day of its premiere at Dresden.
* “Die Nacht” and “Die Sennin,” songs by Sophie Seipt (1812-1889) are based on poems by Lenau.
* Lieder by composer Pauline Volkstein (1849-1925) use text by Lenau.
* &quot;Notturno&quot;, a 1933 song cycle by Othmar Schoeck includes settings of nine poems by Lenau.
* The composer Heinz Holliger has written a song cycle, &quot;Lunea&quot; (2013), using Lenau texts, and an opera, also called &quot;Lunea&quot;, based on the song cycle.

<doc id="390584" wikidata="Q780158" url="?curid=390584" title="Democratic Party (South Africa)">
<text>The Democratic Party (DP) was a South African political party that was the forerunner of the Democratic Alliance. Although the Democratic Party name dates from 1989, the party existed under other labels throughout the apartheid years, when it was the Parliamentary opposition to the ruling National Party&#x27;s policies.

==Background==

The Progressive Federal Party had formed the main parliamentary opposition to the Apartheid regime in the whites-only House of Assembly since 1977. But the party was ousted as the official opposition in the 1987 election and pushed into third place behind the far-right Conservative Party, which opposed even the limited reforms the NP had recently implemented. This led to great disillusionment amongst South Africa&#x27;s white liberal community, and some questioned the merit of continuing to serve in the apartheid parliament. By 1989, they had regrouped, however, and aimed to strengthen the white parliamentary resistance to apartheid; the Progressive Federal Party merged with two smaller reform-minded parties, the Independent Party and the National Democratic Movement (NDM), to become the Democratic Party. The new party had three co-leaders from each of the parties that had entered the merger: Zach de Beer, Denis Worrall and Wynand Malan. De Beer, from the dominant PFP-faction, eventually became the sole leader, however.

==History==
The DP showed its political strength by winning a local by-election in the mostly Afrikaner Linden suburb in Johannesburg, described as a &quot;shock upset&quot; that showed the NP that voters were ready for change. It went on to win 34 seats in the 1989 election, up from 20 before the vote.

In 1990, the NP shifted its race policies towards the centre. President F. W. de Klerk released Nelson Mandela and announced the unbanning of struggle organisations such as the African National Congress, while embracing liberal democracy and opening up its membership to all races. This shift narrowed the political space available to the DP, and the party saw itself further marginalized during the Codesa negotiations which were dominated by the ANC and NP. In the 1994 election, the party won a disappointing 7 seats in the democratic parliament.

===Post-1994===
Following the 1994 election, Tony Leon became the party&#x27;s sole leader.

Under Leon&#x27;s leadership, the DP would become the most active and influential opposition party in the National Assembly, despite its small size. A mid-term review in 1997 found that the party&#x27;s seven members of parliament had asked 50% as many parliamentary questions as the members of the National Party, despite being more than ten times smaller. In 1998, political columnist Howard Barrell wrote that &quot;Seven DP MPs make their National Party counterparts look like 80 feather dusters&quot;. The DP won its first local by-election in a traditional NP constituency in March 1997, and this was followed by several others.

===1998 to 2000===
By 1998, the party was growing its support base significantly, and after the 1999 election, the DP, under the leadership of Leon, became Official Opposition to the ANC-led government, winning 38 seats. In the Western Cape province, it achieved kingmaker status and became the junior partner in a governing coalition with the renamed New National Party (NNP).

This electoral success came at a price, however. The party&#x27;s new supporters largely came from the National Party and consisted overwhelmingly of ethnic minorities, mainly whites. The DP had contested the 1999 election with a highly negative campaign under the controversial slogan &quot;Fight Back&quot;, and many, such as ANC President Thabo Mbeki, were of the view that it was &quot;the transformation of the DP into a right wing political party&quot; that allowed it to capture these voters. Leon and other party leaders dismissed this, however, maintaining that the new supporters would not lead the DP to change its principles. Instead, he said the new recruits would have to ascribe to the liberal-democratic values to which the DP had historically adhered.

===Formation of the Democratic Alliance===
To unify national opposition against the ANC government, the DP and the NNP began planning a merger of the two parties. Accordingly, they formed the Democratic Alliance (DA) in June 2000. The merger agreement was short-lived, with the NNP leaving the alliance in 2001, but the DA closed ranks and retained the new creation, establishing it at all levels of government from 2003 onwards.

<doc id="390585" wikidata="Q9991" url="?curid=390585" title="Chenghua Emperor">
<text>The Chenghua Emperor (9 December 1447 – 9 September 1487), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Xianzong of Ming, personal name Zhu Jianshen, changed to Zhu Jianru in 1457, was the ninth emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1464 to 1487. He succeeded his father, Emperor Yingzong.

The Chenghua Emperor was born in 1447 as the son of Emperor Yingzong. However, when he was only two years old, his father was captured by the Mongols during the Battle of Tumu Fortress. As a result, Emperor Yingzong was deposed and his younger brother, the new Jingtai Emperor, took over the throne. Emperor Yingzong was eventually released from captivity, but was forced into seclusion and house arrest. During this time, he was named crown prince, but was removed from this position after only three years. It was not until 1457, when the Jingtai Emperor was overthrown and died, that Emperor Yingzong was able to return to the throne. At this point, he was once again named crown prince.

He ascended to the throne in February 1464 at the young age of sixteen, succeeding his father. During the initial years of his reign, he implemented a new policy that included tax cuts and a focus on strengthening the state&#x27;s power. However, as time passed, the positive impact of these changes diminished. In the later years of his rule, the Forbidden City was dominated by eunuchs, particularly the notorious Wang Zhi and Liang Fang. The emperor&#x27;s preference for favorites over promoting capable individuals gradually eroded the positive aspects of his rule. This resulted in widespread corruption and the enrichment of his supporters at the expense of the state treasury. Peasant uprisings erupted throughout the country and were brutally suppressed. The emperor ruled with increasing autocracy, bolstering the secret police to monitor the sentiments of the people.

Wan Zhen&#x27;er, a palace lady who was 17 years older than the Chenghua Emperor, held significant sway over the emperor and eventually became his favorite. This was especially true after she gave birth to a son in 1464, although the child died shortly after. Despite this, Lady Wan maintained her hold over the emperor and his harem. She used her loyal eunuchs to force other women to have abortions if they became pregnant with the emperor&#x27;s child, and she did not hesitate to resort to poisoning mothers and their children. It was not until 1475 that the emperor discovered the existence of his five-year-old son, Zhu Youcheng, who had been kept hidden until then.

The Chenghua Emperor was known for his military prowess and placed great emphasis on the strength of his army. During the 1470s, the reorganized Ming troops achieved notable triumphs in their battles against the Mongols, marking the first major victories since 1449. In addition, defensive walls were constructed in Shaanxi and Shanxi, laying the groundwork for the enduring Great Wall of China. The Ming also formed an alliance with Korea and effectively waged war against the Jurchen tribes in eastern Manchuria.

The Chenghua Emperor died in 1487 after 23 years of rule, and Zhu Youcheng ascended the throne as the Hongzhi Emperor.

==Early life and accession==
Zhu Jianshen, the future Chenghua Emperor, was born on 9 December 1447, as the eldest son of Emperor Yingzong and one of his concubines, Lady Zhou.

In 1449, his father was captured by the Mongols in the Battle of Tumu Fortress. As a result, the younger brother of the captured emperor, Zhu Qiyu, temporarily took over the government. At the same time, Zhu Jianshen was created crown prince. A few days later, Zhu Qiyu became the emperor, known as the Jingtai Emperor. In 1450, the Mongols returned the captured Emperor Yingzong to the Ming, but the Jingtai Emperor put him under house arrest. Zhu Jianshen remained crown prince until 1452, when he was demoted to Prince of Yi (). He lived separately from his parents in poor material conditions and began to stutter under the pressure of the situation. However, the new crown prince, the Jingtai Emperor&#x27;s only son, died in 1453. The succession question remained open and Zhu Jianshen&#x27;s position was uncertain until the Jingtai Emperor fell ill in late 1456. This uncertainty was exploited by Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s followers, who staged a coup in February 1457 and restored Yingzong to the throne.

On 1 March 1457, Zhu Jianshen was created crown prince by his father. At the same time, he changed his name from Jianshen to Jianru, possibly because his original name, chosen by the Jingtai Emperor in 1449, was not acceptable to Yingzong.

Zhu Jianshen was often depicted by painters as robustly built, with full cheeks, sharp eyes, large earlobes, and a trimmed mustache and beard. These Central Asian features were also seen in portraits of his ancestors, going back to his great-great-grandfather. His son and successor, while also bearded, was smaller in stature, and other emperors were of a more slender, southern appearance. As a child, Zhu Jianshen was slow to react and had a stutter. This caused Emperor Yingzong to have doubts about his intelligence and ability to rule. However, the Grand Secretaries, primarily Li Xian, convinced him to maintain the succession for his eldest son.

Emperor Yingzong died on 23 February 1464. The following day, a twelve-member imperial council was appointed to discuss government policies and advise the young emperor. The council consisted of six officials: Senior Grand Secretary Li Xian, Minister of Personnel Wang Ao, Minister of Revenue Nian Fu (), Grand Secretary Peng Shi (), Minister of War Ma Ang (; 1399–1476), and Grand Secretary Chen Wen (; 1405–1468); four eunuchs: Liu Yongcheng (), Xia Shi (), Fu Gong, and Niu Yu (); and two military generals: Sun Jizong (), Marquis of Huichang, and Sun Tang (), Marquis of Huaining. On 28 February 1464, he ascended the throne and adopted the era name Chenghua, which means &quot;accomplished change&quot;.

When he assumed control of the government, he was already under the influence of his favorite, Wan Zhen&#x27;er. She had previously been a servant of his grandmother, Empress Sun, and he catered to her every whim. Intelligent and determined, Wan started off as his nanny and eventually became his concubine. At the time of the Chenghua Emperor&#x27;s ascension to the throne, she was 34 years old, twice the age of the seventeen-year-old emperor.

==Relations in the palace==
===Empress dowagers and empresses===

Conflicts among women within the Forbidden City had a negative impact on the emperor&#x27;s reputation. The first incident occurred on the day of his enthronement, when a dispute arose over the title of Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s widow, Empress Qian. According to regulations, the title should have been given to the empress dowager, but the emperor&#x27;s own mother, Lady Zhou, also claimed the same title. Despite being only a consort of Emperor Yingzong, she now held the status of mother to the reigning emperor and thus argued for the same title as Empress Qian. Lady Zhou also emphasized her loyalty to Emperor Yingzong, for which she had suffered alongside him during their years of house arrest from 1450–1457.

In the conflict between the mother and stepmother, the emperor allowed the officials to express their opinions and secretly encouraged them to do so. However, he openly acted with apparent reluctance. Following the suggestions of Peng Shi and Li Xian, both women were given the title of empress dowager, with the addition of the characters &quot;Ciyi&quot; () before it for Empress Qian. However, Lady Zhou perceived this as discrimination and consistently pushed for her equal rights. The young emperor eventually fled from the quarreling empresses and sought refuge with Lady Wan.

After ascending the throne, the Chenghua Emperor married Lady Wu as his empress. However, their relationship was short-lived as she soon clashed with Lady Wan and requested that she be punished for her disrespect. As a result, just one month after their wedding, the emperor deposed Empress Wu and stripped her of her title. She then spent the next 45 years in seclusion within the Forbidden City. In the same year, 1464, Lady Wang became the new empress. She was careful not to provoke Lady Wan and remained childless in order to protect herself from any potential misfortune.

===Successor===
In 1466, Lady Wan gave birth to a son for the emperor and was granted the title of &quot;Noble Consort&quot; (&quot;Guifei&quot;). However, their son died within a year and Lady Wan did not have any other children. In order to secure her position, she closely monitored the emperor and even forced other women to have abortions to prevent the birth of a potential rival son. A few years later, the emperor had a son with another concubine who was named as his successor in December 1471, but the child died shortly after. It is widely believed by historians that Lady Wan played a role in the death of this child.

The court and government were greatly troubled by the absence of an heir and the influence of Lady Wan. Officials expressed their concerns to the emperor in submissions, but he dismissed them as meddling in his personal matters. It was not until June 1475, when the emperor lamented his lack of an heir at the age of twenty-eight, that a eunuch present impulsively informed him of the existence of a five-year-old son being raised by the former Empress Wu.

A few years earlier, the emperor had an affair with a girl surnamed Ji from Guangxi, who was likely a captive of the Yao tribe and brought to the palace around 1467. In 1469, she met the emperor and became pregnant. Lady Wan discovered the pregnancy, but her orders for the eunuchs to give the mother an abortifacient were not followed. Instead, they hid her in the chambers of Wu&#x27;s dissecting room, where she gave birth to a boy on 30 July 1470. For the next five years, the mother and child lived in secrecy with Lady Wu. 

The emperor, who was very enthusiastic about his son, recognized him and named him Zhu Youcheng. He then moved the child to safety under the protection of Empress Dowager Zhou. A month later, Lady Ji died under suspicious circumstances. The emperor then moved out of the palace occupied by Lady Wan and protected his heir from her. Empress Dowager Zhou even warned the heir not to eat or drink anything when visiting Lady Wan.

===Lady Wan&#x27;s camaraderie===
The emperor&#x27;s relationship with Lady Wan changed after 1475, as he had five consorts and a total of eleven sons and six daughters between 1476 and 1487. Despite no longer living with her, the emperor remained devoted to her and may have tried to make up for his absence by supporting her activities. During the latter part of his reign, he rarely restricted her actions, even when they were illegal. Her agents were involved in various activities, such as mining for copper, silver, gold, and precious stones in Yunnan, foreign trade, pearl gathering in Guangdong, tax collection along the Yangtze River, and the salt trade. In 1483, one of her eunuchs was so arrogant while purchasing antiques in Suzhou that local officials and gentry were almost provoked to take up arms. Upon learning of his misconduct, the emperor had him executed. Her chief eunuch, Liang Fang (), was in charge of the imperial warehouse in Beijing, giving him the opportunity to sell goods at inflated prices to cover up the sale of offices organized by Lady Wan.

Despite numerous complaints, the emperor did not punish Lady Wan for her actions. In fact, he punished officials who spoke out against her abuse of power, excessive spending, and corruption. As a result, she maintained significant influence until her death in 1487.

Another notorious eunuch during the Chenghua era was Wang Zhi (), a Yao-born man who was captured and castrated during the counterinsurgency campaigns of the 1460s. He initially served as a servant to Lady Wan, but only held minor positions until he was put in charge of the Western Depot in 1477. This secret police force was created to supplement the already-established Eastern Depot. However, Wang Zhi soon clashed with Grand Secretary Shang Lu () and Minister of War Xiang Zhong (), leading to their dismissal. During this time, only those who were closely aligned with Lady Wan or those who remained silent were able to keep their positions. Wang Zhi terrorized the elite of Beijing for several years before being sent to inspect border troops in 1482. In 1483, his rival from the Eastern Depot presented accusations that gained the emperor&#x27;s trust, resulting in Wang Zhi being transferred to guard the imperial tombs in Nanjing.

==Economy and culture==
===Trade, crafts, and finance===

After a long period of economic depression, the economy of China and its neighboring countries began to recover in the second half of the 15th century. This was largely due to the increase in precious metal mining, which saw a slight rise in China, Southeast Asia, and West Africa, and a significant increase in Europe. As a result, there was a surge in the import of Eastern goods such as pepper, spices, and porcelain to Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. In China, the Jingdezhen porcelain factories resumed production, leading to a flourishing trade on the southeast coast. Not only did Ming pottery regain its popularity in Asian and African markets, but it also made its way to Europe in the 1480s. The products from the Chenghua era of Jingdezhen are considered some of the finest examples of Ming porcelain in terms of design and decoration. Of particular significance is the development of &quot;doucai&quot; (; literally meaning &#x27;contrasted colors&#x27;), which was highly admired and imitated in the following century.

Trade was further bolstered by the rapid development of transportation, which was spurred by a surge in bridge construction following the devastating floods in central and southern China in 1465. This led to the growth of the silk industry in the 1470s and 1480s, with silk production shifting from urban centers to rural areas in Jiangnan. As a result, silk was woven in &quot;every village&quot; around Lake Tai. This resulting economic boom brought about significant changes, including the expansion of cities and commerce, particularly in the southern and southeastern regions. This was further supported by the increase in foreign trade after 1470 and the influx of Japanese silver. As a result of this economic growth, the economy became increasingly monetized.

Since the closure of the mints in the 1430s, there has been a shortage of copper coins. This created an opportunity for counterfeiters to thrive. Although there were occasional proposals to combat private coinage by resuming state minting, they were ultimately rejected. As a result, illegal mints flourished and their &quot;new coins&quot; began to replace the old Yongle coppers in Beijing markets. These private coins were of poorer quality, often containing tin or iron admixture that was visibly different from the genuine coins. However, due to the scarcity of the old mintages, merchants had no choice but to use these counterfeits, even though they were only worth 1/2 to 1/3 of their face value. Some merchants refused to accept Ming coins altogether, while others only accepted silver. This led to workers being paid in low-quality coins, resulting in them losing half of their real income. As a result, coins began to disappear from circulation and the government, similar to earlier banknotes, attempted to support their value by requiring payments to be made in them. Starting in 1465, it became possible to pay commercial fees in both banknotes and coins. However, the government refused to release coins from the treasury or mint new ones.

The issue of money also had a significant impact on foreign trade during this time. The Japanese missions of 1468, 1477, and 1483 were characterized by the Japanese&#x27;s persistent efforts to return to the conditions of Yongle&#x27;s rule, when they were able to exchange their goods for coppers at a more favorable rate than what was available in the market. However, the Ming authorities had a different goal—to minimize payments in coins and instead use silk and other goods as currency. They also tried to force the Japanese to accept the &quot;new coins&quot; at face value, which the Japanese viewed as theft. As a result, coins were mainly obtained in Japan through fraudulent trade.

===Agriculture===
Despite advancements in trade, crafts, and urbanization, agriculture in the Ming dynasty was struggling. The population was rapidly growing, but a colder climate in the late 15th century hindered the success of peasant farmers. This led to widespread famines in northern and central China, particularly in the 1460s, and soaring food prices—by the early 1470s, rice was two and a half times more expensive than it was in the 1430s. Banditry also became a major issue, even on the outskirts of the capital. In an effort to assist the population, the government implemented measures such as constructing irrigation canals and providing millet from state reserves during the famine in the Beijing area. They also offered displaced peasants the opportunity to return to their homes, potentially with temporary housing, as well as seed, livestock, and a five-year tax exemption.

During the Chenghua era, the size of the imperial estates () grew from a small area to over 80 thousand hectares. By the beginning of the 16th century, they had increased sixteen times. The revenues from these estates were the personal income of the monarch. However, this personal estate of the monarch was met with disapproval from officials. One censor even objected, questioning why the emperor was competing with landowners when he already owned the entire country. These vast estates were acquired by the monarch and the empress, as well as empress dowagers, heirs to the throne, relatives of empresses, eunuchs, and various favorites. This expansion of estates, similar to the imperial estates, had negative effects on the original landowners who were forced to become tenants, as well as on the state treasury. Not only did the emperor and his entourage benefit from this, but also wealthy landowners who took advantage of the situation at the expense of small peasants. This was particularly evident in Jiangnan, where in contrast to the early Ming period, the government had previously restricted and closely monitored the growth of large landowners.

===Culture===

The emperor was renowned for his skill in calligraphy, as evidenced by his surviving work, a color scroll painting from 1481 depicting the mythological demon warrior Zhong Kui, titled &quot;Sui chao jia zhao&quot; (). He also had a passion for theater and music, and even had his own troupe of eunuch actors. In 1478, he composed several poems that have since been lost. In 1483, he wrote the preface for &quot;Wenhua daxun&quot; (), a collection of instructions for his successor. The emperor also showed support for Buddhism, as seen in his order for the construction of five pagodas in the Indian style west of Beijing in 1473. These pagodas are believed to be the only ones of their kind in the Beijing area.

However, the majority of Confucians held a negative attitude towards Buddhism and its methods of cultivating one&#x27;s personality. This was exemplified by Hu Juren (), a prominent Neo-Confucian during that period. Another influential figure in the intellectual community at the time was Chen Baisha, a scholar from Guangdong who mentored many significant scholars and officials.

==Chenghua as emperor==
===Relations with officials===

The Chenghua Emperor was known for his generosity and lack of desire for revenge, even for the wrongs he may have experienced in his childhood. He was widely praised for his efforts to restore the reputation of those who had been unfairly treated in the past, and he also implemented measures to aid areas that were suffering from famine. However, in 1468, the emperor did order for three Hanlin academics to be beaten after they got into a dispute with Empress Dowager Zhou over the decoration of the Lantern Festival. This was a rare occurrence, as the Chenghua Emperor generally did not resort to physical punishment for dignitaries, unlike other emperors of the dynasty.

In both military and civilian affairs, he relied on the advice of the Grand Secretaries and ministers. He highly valued honest and capable officials, but he also allowed Lady Wan to promote unsuitable individuals. This led to a lack of decisiveness on his part, as he would briefly align himself with one side or the other during government discussions. However, his efforts to reconcile differences among factions did help to reduce conflicts, although there was still some tension between northerners and southerners, with the emperor showing slight favoritism towards the latter. Out of the three Grand Secretaries during the Chenghua Emperor&#x27;s ascension to the throne, only Li Xian was from the north, while Chen Wen and Peng Shi were from Jiangxi.

After 1464, the most influential position in the government was held by Grand Secretary Li Xian, who continued to hold significant power even during the final years of Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s reign. Li Xian strategically appointed capable and respected individuals to important positions within the administration. His influence was not perceived as excessive, as he prioritized open discussion when making decisions. He consistently sought input from both civil servants and military officers when making personnel decisions.

The original Grand Secretaries were gradually replaced by the brilliant scholars Liu Tingzhi (; d. 1469) and Shang Lu (dismissed in 1477). However, the emperor also appointed the opportunistic and unprincipled Wan An (; d. 1489) and Liu Ji (; d. 1493) to the Grand Secretariat. In the later years of the Chenghua Emperor&#x27;s reign, the infamous eunuchs Wang Zhi and Liang Fang held powerful positions. The camaraderie around Lady Wan also had a negative reputation. Under their influence, the emperor distanced himself from his officials, causing them to wait for years for a personal audience with him.

===Growth of the eunuch bureaucracy===
During the 15th century, the number of eunuchs in the imperial palace increased significantly, with a growing number of them serving in both civil and military roles, as well as in the provinces. By the end of the century, there were over 10,000 eunuchs in service, nearly equaling the number of regular civil servants. In the following century, their numbers even surpassed those of regular civil servants.

Eunuchs held a significant role in military affairs, overseeing the purchase of horses from abroad and the majority of (tributary) foreign trade, as well as the production of weapons, state production of silk, brocade, and porcelain, procurement and transportation of court supplies, management of the palace and imperial tombs. They also controlled the secret service, whose actions often gave rise to complaints. Protests against the abuses of the secret service, which caused fear of arrest and torture among officials, merchants, and ordinary citizens in the capital, were unsuccessful. On the contrary, they furthered the careers of minister Xiang Zhong and Grand Secretary Shang Lu.

The above matters were managed by the eunuch bureaucracy independently from the civilian authorities. Under the Chenghua Emperor&#x27;reign, it expanded and strengthened and its power began to be formally recognized—an example of this was the appointment of eunuchs to the imperial council formed after the death of Yingzong. An example of the growing power of the eunuchs was the system of reviewing court cases. This was carried out by the &quot;three judicial offices&quot;, namely the Censorate, the Ministry of Justice, and the Court of Judicature and Revision. Every autumn, they reviewed death sentences and either confirmed, mitigated, or sent them back for further investigation. From the 1440s, eunuchs sometimes represented the emperor in meetings, and under the Chenghua Emperor&#x27;s reign, their influence continued to increase and they did not hesitate to assert their opinions against the Grand Secretaries and officials in these meetings.

==Rebellions and wars==
===Army===
The Chenghua Emperor looked up to his military-minded grandfather and father, the emperors Xuande and Yingzong, as his role models. He followed an active military policy and generously rewarded his generals, appointing nine counts and one marquis for their achievements.

During the Chenghua era, the Ming army was organized into approximately 500 guards (&quot;wei&quot;) under the &quot;Weisuo&quot; system, with each guard consisting of battalions (&quot;suo&quot;) spread throughout the empire. Theoretically, these guards were supposed to have 3 million soldiers, but in reality, the number was only about half of that. These guards were overseen by Five Chief Military Commissions. Additionally, there were over 70 guard units of Imperial Guards stationed in and around Beijing, theoretically adding another million men to the army. However, their actual numbers were much lower, as many of their soldiers were employed as laborers and tens of thousands of supernumerary officers were appointed and paid. Unlike the guards under the Five Chief Military Commissions, the Imperial Guards were not subject to their authority. They were also exempt from the nine defense areas along the northern border, which had approximately 300,000 soldiers who were better trained and supplied than the inland units.

In the late 15th century, the military competence of hereditary officers had significantly declined and their ties to the throne had weakened compared to the beginning of the century. Instead of inexperienced second- or third titled generation descendants of once successful generals, military matters were now overseen by civilian officials and eunuchs who were committed to military careers. These armies were led by officials who were also involved in military affairs, including Han Yong (; 1422–1478), Wang Yue (; 1426–1499), Xiang Zhong (1421–1502), and Ma Wensheng (; 1426–1510).

===Military reforms===
After ascending to the throne, the Chenghua Emperor implemented a new system of selecting officers through special examinations. However, in the 1470s, there was a rise in the use of military trials. Concurrently, the emperor initiated significant changes to the military training of the Beijing garrison units. Previously, soldiers from various provinces were sent to the Three Great Camps () for training: &quot;Wujun&quot; () for infantry, &quot;Sanqian&quot; () for cavalry, and &quot;Shenji&quot; () for units equipped with firearms. In May 1464, the emperor ordered the reinstatement of a unified training corps (which had previously existed from 1449 to 1457) and divided it into twelve divisions (), each consisting of ten thousand soldiers. These soldiers were selected from a pool of over 300,000 individuals from the three camps, with the majority being sent back to their respective provinces.

The purpose of this measure was to train infantry, cavalry, and units armed with firearms to work together in mixed divisions. Previously, these groups had been trained separately in three different camps. Marquis Sun Jizong was in overall command of these divisions, but the military side was actually led by eunuch Liu Yongcheng, a 73-year-old veteran from the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s reign. Each division also had a deputy commander, known as &quot;Jian qiang nei chen&quot; (; &#x27;Armory-inspecting Eunuch&#x27;), who was a eunuch and in charge of firearms. The emperor&#x27;s most trusted personnel were responsible for closely guarding the firearms. However, starting in the mid-1470s, the divisions were completely under the control of eunuchs, likely due to the influence of Wang Zhi.

The newly trained Beijing corps played a crucial role in successful campaigns on the northern frontier, defeating the Mongols in 1471, 1473, and 1480, as well as the Jurchens in 1467 and 1479. Their reputation as fierce and ruthless soldiers earned them the responsibility of being on alert in case of an uprising in western Shaanxi in 1478. However, on the advice of Peng Shi, they remained in Beijing, as he was concerned about the safety of the civilian population if they were deployed. Despite this, small detachments were still sent to combat the insurgent Yao tribes in Guangxi. As time went on, the corps began to weaken as it was used for both public and private labor, leading to criticism. However, during the early Chenghua era, it remained a strong and effective force.

===Rebellions in the South-West frontier===
The Yao rebellion in Guangxi, led by tribal leader Hou Dagou (), had been brewing since the 1450s and broke out in 1464. At the same time, the Miao and Zhuang also rebelled. The center of the rebellion was in the mountainous landscape 120–160 km northwest of the seat of Xunzhou Prefecture (present-day Guiping). The rebels surprised the Chinese by bringing the fighting from the mountains to the densely populated coastal areas of Guangdong. The rebellion and troop movements also spread to southern Huguang, Guizhou, and Jiangxi. Local dignitaries hoped to placate the Yao with amnesty and donations. However, Minister of War Wang Hong () decided on a forceful response. He appointed General Zhao Fu () to lead the expeditionary army, but the army was actually led by his deputy Han Yong, the new Governor of Guangdong. They had 30,000 soldiers at their disposal, including a thousand of the feared Mongol mounted archers, and 160,000 local forces. In 1466, Han Yong attacked the heart of the rebel territory in two columns drawn from Huguang from the north and from Guangdong from the west, and conquered them in a series of fierce battles. The pacification of the region took several more years. Han Yong, who remained in the south until 1468, reorganized local administration by establishing a new county, strengthening coordination between the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, and incorporating Yao chieftains into Ming administration.

Hou Dagou&#x27;s rebellion was one of the strongest uprisings among the minority peoples of the southwest in the late 15th century, but it was not the only one. In the following years, the Miao and Yao also rebelled in different parts of southwestern China. General Li Zhen () repeatedly defeated them on the border of Guizhou and Huguang, instilling fear and terror among the subjugated areas. In 1467 and again in 1475–1476, he and his army slaughtered thousands of Miao rebels. Another rebellion occurred on the border of Guizhou and Sichuan from 1466 to 1468, and the Minister of War, Cheng Xin (), was sent to suppress it. However, the rebellion resurfaced in 1477–1480. In the 1460s and 1470s, a series of Miao rebellions erupted in southern Sichuan and were forcefully suppressed by the governor, Zhang Gang (). He alternately fought against the Miao in the south of the province and the Tibetans in the northwest.

Even the Zhuangs rebelled, with their use of poisoned arrows causing fear among warriors. They were employed against the Yao during battles with Hou Dagou. However, by the end of the 15th century, the Zhuangs had rebelled twice against Ming rule.

===Jingxiang rebellion===
The Jingxiang rebellion of 1465–1476 was the most significant uprising in China during the 15th century. It was also considered the most significant social upheaval in the Ming state between the civil war of 1399–1402 and the Li Zicheng rebellion in the final years of the Ming dynasty. The rebellion was named after the prefectures of Jingzhou and Xiangyang, located in the northwestern region of Huguang.

During the early Ming period, the prefectures of Jingzhou and Xiangyang were largely uninhabited. However, starting in the 1430s, they began to see an influx of illegal immigrants. In the 1460s, famines repeatedly struck northern China and the lower and middle regions of the Yangtze River, leading to an increase in the number of refugees in the Jingxiang region. It is estimated that there were less than two million refugees living independently from the state. These refugees were led by Liu Tong (), who united small bands of robbers and declared himself the King of Han. He then proceeded to establish his own administration and organize an army of ten thousand soldiers. In response, the government sent troops led by Zhu Yong (), Count of Funing, and Bai Gui (), Minister of Works. In 1465, these troops gathered from various provinces, including Li Zhen&#x27;s troops from Huguang, and successfully crushed the rebellion. Liu Tong himself was captured in the summer of 1466.

The issue of weak official administration persisted, and in 1470, an additional 900,000 individuals migrated to the region due to famine, sparking a new rebellion. Xiang Zhong, the chief censor at the time, was tasked with quelling the uprising. He enlisted the assistance of Li Zhen and raised an army of 250,000 in Huguang province. Together, they successfully suppressed the rebellion, resulting in the execution of hundreds, the exile of thousands, and the return of 1.5 million individuals to their respective homelands.

However, people began to return to the region and in the summer of 1476, they rebelled once again. In response, the government sent Yuan Jie (), a censor, to investigate the social and economic conditions in the area. This sparked a lively discussion in the court about potential solutions to the problem. Ultimately, the government decided to address the issues through social and organizational measures in the region and entrusted Yuan Jie with their implementation. He recognized the rights of immigrants to the land they cultivated and registered over 113,000 families with 438,000 members. As per his suggestion, several new counties were established and by the end of 1476, the new prefecture of Yunyang was formed. In the seat of the new prefecture, a defense military command was established with jurisdiction over the adjacent counties of neighboring provinces. In just one year, Yuan Jie successfully stabilized the situation and brought calm to the region through proper administration.

===Foreign policy and the attempted conquest of Hami===
The Ming presence beyond China&#x27;s borders was merely symbolic, limited to granting titles, ranks, and trade privileges without interfering in the daily lives of those affected. States and tribes to the north and northwest of Ming China were eager to engage in trade and commerce with the Ming, resulting in an increase in the number and frequency of tribute messages. However, the Mongols were not hesitant to resort to raiding in order to expand trade and acquire more iron, grain, handicrafts, and luxury goods, much to the dismay of the Chinese. While Ming titles could lend legitimacy to the rule of the recipient and grant them the right to engage in tributary relations, the Ming government was not obligated to provide any official authority over their subjects, as they did in China. Despite this, the Chinese were still keen on expanding their influence and prestige in the northern steppes.

During the Chenghua Emperor&#x27;s reign, the Ming dynasty&#x27;s interests in Central Asia were limited to attempting to gain control of Hami, a Silk Road city located in present-day Xinjiang. The Uighur rulers of Hami were followers of Islam and acknowledged Ming sovereignty, receiving the title of &quot;wang&quot; (king) from the Ming emperors. However, in the early 1470s, the ruler of Hami was killed by a prince from Moghulistan who declared himself the Sultan of Turpan and immediately engaged in conflict with the &quot;pagan&quot; (non-Muslim) Oirats. This fighting occurred in the northwest region of his territory, specifically in the Ili Valley. In Beijing, ministers have been discussing whether to address the clashes and unrest in Hami through military action or diplomatic means (such as cutting ties).

In 1473, the Ming attempted to reinstate the previous government in Hami. A small Chinese force was dispatched, with the support of two Mongol tribes who were the largest allies of the Ming in the region between China and Hami. The Mongols, numbering 30,000, joined the Chinese in their mission. However, upon reaching Hami, they discovered that the enemy&#x27;s army had already passed them, causing the Mongols to retreat and defend their own territories. The Chinese detachment was easily defeated by the Turpans. It was not until the early 1490s that the Chinese once again became involved in the situation in Hami.

===Wars with the Mongols and Jurchens===
In Manchuria, there were 384 Jurchen tribal chiefs who held formal Ming titles as guard commanders. In 1465 and 1479, the Chenghua Emperor launched attacks against the Jurchens, utilizing the restored Ming military power. These campaigns were aided by Korean troops and proved successful in weakening the Jianzhou Jurchens, leaving them divided until the early 17th century.

Due to the complex and ever-changing political landscape in Mongolia, the Chinese had only a vague understanding of the situation. In the latter half of the 15th century, the Mongols were divided into several groups: the Uriankhai in the north and northeast of the Beijing area, the Tumed Mongols in the north of Shanxi, and the Ordos Mongols in the Ordos region north of Shaanxi. The Chinese referred to the population living behind these groups as Tatars. Additionally, there were a number of small principalities along the Sino-Mongol border and the Silk Road in the northwest. Among all the Mongol groups, the Uriankhai were the most stable and had the closest relationship with the Ming dynasty.

In 1468, the Mongols rebelled in Guyuan, a border headquarters located between Xi&#x27;an and Lanzhou. The local Mongols had been settled there since the late 1460s and were under the rule of their own hereditary chiefs. In June 1468, for unknown reasons, they rose up and fortified themselves in the mountains north of the city, successfully defeating the local Ming troops. In response, the government sent an army led by Xiang Zhong and Ma Wensheng, who was then the chief censor and governor of Shaanxi. By the fall of 1468, the army had successfully eliminated the rebels within a few months, with the last of them being defeated in early 1469.

The Guyuan incident raised concerns among some Beijing dignitaries about the presence of Mongols in Chinese territory and their potential connections with Mongols across the border and even with Tibetans. In 1468 and 1469, invaders from Mongolia attacked Yulin, further emphasizing the danger to the reorganized Beijing garrison. The commanders of the garrison were eager for battle in order to test their troops and gain glory and booty. However, they faced opposition from Grand Secretaries Peng Shi and Shang Lu, who argued that the rebellion had already been defeated.

The responsibility for resolving the situation was given to Wang Yue, the most capable follower of the war party associated with eunuchs and courtiers. He was transferred to Yulin at the end of 1469. In 1470, Wang successfully defeated the Mongol invaders in a series of battles. Bai Gui, an opponent of the war party and now Minister of War, sent Yu Zijun () to the area as governor (he remained in office until 1477). Together, Yu Zijun and Wang Yue were able to stabilize the situation. While Wang was defeating the Mongols in the field (in 1471 and 1473), Yu planned the construction of a defensive wall at Ordos. Despite concerns about the cost, the government eventually gave permission in 1474. Within a few months, 40,000 soldiers built a 1777 &quot;li&quot; (1000 km) long wall, standing 9 meters high and equipped with numerous towers and other supporting structures. This wall proved effective in a major attack during the summer of 1482.

Nevertheless, Mongol raids continued after that. At the end of the 15th century, the Mongol power was partly restored by Batumöngke, the Great Khan of the Mongols from 1480. Under his leadership, the Mongols renewed their attacks on Chinese territory, nullifying the Ming victories of the 1470s.

==Death and legacy==

The Chenghua Emperor died on 9 September 1487 and was buried in Mao Mausoleum (). He was given the posthumous name Emperor Chun () and the temple name Xianzong (). He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Zhu Youcheng, who became known as the Hongzhi Emperor.

In both military and civil affairs, the emperor is highly regarded for his willingness to listen to the advice of capable politicians, such as Li Xian and Peng Shi. This helped to keep dissensions between regional cliques of officials at a manageable level. The Chenghua era was a time of significant political and cultural transition, marked by the increasing dominance of civil officials over the military, the growing influence of the southern region, and the shift of the cultural center from Jiangxi to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

However, the emperor cannot be absolved of responsibility for selling offices to the clique around Lady Wan and the eunuchs. Many of those appointed were his favorites. While the emperor&#x27;s cautious and phlegmatic nature prevented him from being completely controlled by anyone, Lady Wan and some eunuchs took advantage of his favor for personal gain.

Nevertheless, despite the excesses of the eunuchs, his reign is considered one of the most prosperous periods in Ming history. The eunuchs&#x27; actions were offset by long-term benefits, the most significant being the expansion into Yao tribal territory in Guangdong and Guangxi. This allowed for control over the Xi River valley and its tributaries, providing opportunities for transportation and settlement. Additionally, military expeditions to Luzhou in 1465 successfully eliminated the threat posed by natives in Sichuan, ensuring safe passage along the Yangtze River. Military reforms were also implemented, strengthening the army but also increasing the influence of eunuchs, who often held high-ranking positions. As a result of several successful attacks, the Jurchens were weakened and posed no significant threat for the next century. In 1474, the construction of the 1000 km long Great Wall in Shanxi further fortified the defense against the Mongols in the bend of the Yellow River.

<text>The Hongzhi Emperor (30 July 1470 – 9 June 1505), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Xiaozong of Ming, personal name Zhu Youcheng, was the tenth emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1487 to 1505. He succeeded his father, the Chenghua Emperor. 

The Hongzhi Emperor was born during a time in which Lady Wan, the favorite concubine of his father, the Chenghua Emperor, and her supporters were eliminating all potential heirs to the throne. Fortunately, the young emperor&#x27;s son was saved by the former empress and spared from death. He did not reunite with his father until the age of five, when he was named crown prince. From a young age, he displayed exceptional intelligence and excelled in his studies, receiving a comprehensive Confucian education.

After ascending the throne in 1487, the emperor&#x27;s administration was guided by Confucian ideology, and he himself was known for his diligence and hard work. He closely oversaw all state affairs, implementing measures such as reducing taxes and government spending, and appointing capable officials to ministerial positions. This marked a rare period of harmonious cooperation between the emperor and his grand secretaries and ministers during the Middle Ming period. In addition, the emperor encouraged his ministers to openly express their opinions and even criticize his decisions. As a result, the power of the eunuchs was diminished and the palace intrigues that had plagued previous reigns were eliminated. This led to a more transparent government and revitalized the functioning of the authorities.

Under the order of the emperor, the Great Ming Code was updated and supplemented. The empire&#x27;s economy was thriving, and the government sought to address the shortage of currency by resuming the production of coins that had been abolished in the 1430s. Despite facing a series of floods, the Yellow River was successfully regulated, and foreign trade with Southeast Asia flourished. The Hongzhi Emperor&#x27;s foreign policy was peaceful, with the only major military campaign during his reign being the expedition to Hami in 1495. Ming troops also effectively suppressed several smaller rebellions. As a result, the people prospered under his rule. In comparison to his renowned predecessors, the Hongzhi Emperor can be considered one of the most successful rulers of the Ming dynasty, alongside emperors Hongwu and Yongle.

==Early life and accession==
Zhu Youcheng, the future Hongzhi Emperor, was born on 30 July 1470. He was the third son of the Chenghua Emperor, the eighth emperor of the Chinese Ming dynasty, and the oldest to survive. His mother was a woman surnamed Ji (), who was one of the Yao women captured during the suppression of the rebellion in the southern Chinese province of Guangxi and brought into the palace. He inherited his mother&#x27;s southern appearance: small stature, darker complexion; he had a bushy moustache, a sparse beard, and intelligent, bright eyes. However, he was not physically strong and often suffered from illness in his later years.

In 1469, Lady Ji formed a close relationship with the emperor. However, after becoming pregnant, she had to live secretly in the chambers of the former Empress Wu due to the danger posed by the emperor&#x27;s favorite, Lady Wan. Lady Wan was known for ruthlessly eliminating any potential rivals for the emperor&#x27;s favor. It was not until Zhu Youcheng was five years old, in June 1475, that the emperor learned of his son&#x27;s existence. He enthusiastically acknowledged his son, but just a month later, Lady Ji died under suspicious circumstances. From then on, the safety of the boy was overseen by his grandmother, Empress Dowager Zhou. The death of his mother must have been a great shock to Zhu Youcheng, as he deeply respected and remembered her even in adulthood.

On 5 December 1475, Zhu Youcheng was named crown prince. The old educated eunuch Tan Ji () began to teach him to read (The Four Books) and in March 1478, the young prince&#x27;s formal education in Confucian philosophy began. A book about exemplary successors was written in 1481 specifically because of his education. His teachers were able to instill Confucianism in him more effectively than other emperors, and he remained faithful to its teachings even in adulthood.

Concerned about her fate after the Chenghua Emperor&#x27;s death and the accession of Zhu Youcheng, Lady Wan began plotting against the successor. Her eunuch ally, Liang Fang (), proposed appointing a new heir, claiming that Zhu Youcheng was unintelligent and inferior. However, another eunuch, Huai En (), defended the prince and argued for the right of inheritance of the eldest son and the stability of the dynasty. As a result, he was transferred to Fengyang, the &quot;Central Capital&quot;. Shortly after, the court received news of an earthquake on Mount Tai, which was associated with the crown prince in the beliefs of the time. Officials who supported Zhu Youcheng saw this as a warning from Heaven, displeased with the discussion of succession. Fearing the disfavor of Heaven, the Chenghua Emperor did not make a decision to change the crown prince.

In February 1487, Zhu Youcheng married Lady Zhang from Xingji (), a city located on the Grand Canal, less than 200 km south of Beijing (present-day Qing County, Cangzhou prefecture). He was deeply devoted to his wife and remained monogamous, making him the only emperor in Chinese history to do so. Together, they had two sons and three daughters.

On 1 September 1487, the Chenghua Emperor fell ill and three days later, he entrusted Zhu Youcheng with overseeing the actions of the grand secretaries. He died on 9 September. On 17 September 1487, Zhu Youcheng ascended to the throne and adopted the era name Hongzhi, which means &quot;great governance&quot;.

As soon as he took power, he named his wife as empress and his mother as Empress Dowager Xiaomu. He then commanded a hunt for his mother&#x27;s relatives in Guangxi Province. Two found cousins were named officers of the Imperial Guard. However, they later got into a dispute with another alleged cousin, and in the end, all three were revealed as fraudsters. Despite this, the emperor did construct a temple in Guangxi to pay tribute to his mother&#x27;s unknown ancestors and a shrine in the Forbidden City to honor her memory.

==Relations in the palace==
===The empress and her relatives===
The Hongzhi Emperor was completely devoted to his wife. However, the empress was a foolish woman who only cared about her relatives, especially her brothers. She was more concerned with living a luxurious life and trusting Taoist and Buddhist monks. As a result, the court became consumed with luxury and pleasure, something that had not been seen under previous rulers. 

After their son was born in October 1491, the emperor began to favor not only his wife, but also her father, brothers—Zhang Heling () and Zhang Yanling ()—and all other relatives. In 1490, the empress&#x27;s father had already been granted the title of Count of Shouning (). Then, in the spring of 1492, the Hongzhi Emperor named his young son as crown prince, further solidifying the power and influence of the Zhang family. Shortly after, the empress&#x27;s father made an unprecedented request for a promotion to marquis, which was granted despite opposition from many officials. He died that same year and was posthumously elevated to Duke of Chang (). The title of Marquis was then inherited by his elder son, while the younger became Count and later Marquis of Jianchang (). Both brothers received numerous gifts, including land, stewardship of imperial warehouses in Beijing, and licenses to trade in salt. Even the extended family of the Zhangs were granted titles, offices, lands, and opportunities for corruption that were unparalleled compared to the relatives of other Ming empresses.

Officials frequently complained about the behavior of the empress&#x27;s relatives, particularly her brothers. They were accused of corruption, embezzlement, and, in their home county south of Beijing, of seizing land from their neighbors. Despite these accusations, the empress and her mother always defended the Zhang brothers. They were also supported by a group of eunuchs and officials who had advanced their careers through their connections with the Zhang family. As a result, the emperor shielded the entire family from any punishment, even though he generally did not punish critics (according to Confucian ethics, officials should not be punished for honestly and directly pointing out mistakes). 

The emperor shared a belief in Taoism with his wife, which was frowned upon by officials, especially when he appointed Taoist monks to high ranks. Towards the end of the Hongzhi Emperor&#x27;s reign, similar negative patterns from the Chenghua era began to emerge, although not to the same extent. These included the establishment of imperial estates, direct appointments that bypassed the Ministry of Personnel, patronage in the salt trade, and bribery, which damaged the image of a conscientious and hard-working, yet inefficient, emperor.

===Eunuchs===
After ascending to the throne, the Hongzhi Emperor demoted and exiled corrupt and unpopular eunuchs, such as Liang Fang. He then appointed capable and trustworthy candidates to lead the Directorate of Ceremonial, which also informally served as the head of the eunuchs in the imperial palace. One such candidate was Huai En, who had previously retired. Despite these efforts, officials continued to criticize the eunuchs and disapprove of the emperor and his family&#x27;s favor towards Buddhists and Taoists. However, the emperor&#x27;s decision to limit the powers of the eunuch secret police units, known as the Western and Eastern Depots, was met with gratitude by the bureaucracy and population of the capital. The emperor also made sure to appoint honorable men to lead these units, as well as the Imperial Guard.

During the reign of the Hongzhi Emperor, only two politically significant cases related to eunuchs arose. In 1489, Jiang Cong, who had been one of the three dignitaries governing Nanjing for many years, became embroiled in a dispute with the censors over the legality of certain incomes. These incomes were apparently used to pay for the emperor&#x27;s expenses. Jiang Cong blamed the censors for their inability to detect other violations of the law, while the censors accused him of wrongdoing. The emperor ultimately ruled in Jiang Cong&#x27;s favor in 1490, but the attacks from officials continued until he was deposed in 1494. His downfall was due to his construction projects disrupting Nanjing&#x27;s geomantic configuration. The second case involved Li Guang, who was commissioned by the emperor to raise funds through the sale of salt licenses and payments for the promotion and appointment of officials. Officials repeatedly accused him of making mistakes, but their attempts to discredit him were unsuccessful. However, on 28 October 1498, Li Guang was driven to commit suicide after it was alleged that a pavilion he had built in the imperial gardens was placed in an unsuitable location according to feng shui principles. This was believed to have caused a series of misfortunes, including the death of the emperor&#x27;s eldest daughter on 1 October and a fire in one of the palaces of the Forbidden City on 26 October.

==Hongzhi as emperor==
===Reduction of bureaucracy and composition of the government===

At the start of his reign, the emperor made efforts to reduce unnecessary spending and eliminate corrupt eunuch-run agencies. He placed great importance on the competence and integrity of his bureaucracy, and was even stricter than previous Ming emperors (with the exception of the founder of the dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor) in removing incompetent and dishonest officials. Shortly after taking the throne, he conducted a thorough purge of the court, removing many flatterers who had obtained their positions through bribery rather than merit. This included dismissing two thousand extra officials and nearly a thousand Taoists, Buddhists, and lamas, whom he sent back to their homes. He also imprisoned or executed the most corrupt Buddhist and Taoist monks. Additionally, he removed the relatives of Lady Wan from their positions and disgraced Senior Grand Secretary, Wan An (), who was the head of the government.

Instead, he called upon able and straightforward men who had previously retired. Among them were the eunuch Huai En and the official Wang Shu (), who were appointed as the Minister of Personnel. He sought their advice in selecting the other ministers. The leading ministers in Hongzhi&#x27;s government were Ma Wensheng, who successively headed the Censorate, the Ministry of War, and the Ministry of Personnel, and Liu Daxia (), who served as Minister of War during the last five years of the Hongzhi Emperor&#x27;s reign. The emperor frequently consulted with Liu Daxia, which was unusual in the Ming administrative system.

He also sought advice from the Grand Secretaries as a group. Of the three Grand Secretaries from the previous era, two had a bad reputation and were dismissed—Wan An and Liu Jue (). This left only Liu Ji (), who was still criticized by some censors. However, the newly appointed Grand Secretaries, Liu Jian () and Xu Pu (), as well as those selected a few years later, Qiu Jun (), Li Dongyang, and Xie Qian (), were all honorable men. This led to exceptional harmony at court.

===Governing style===

The Hongzhi Emperor wholeheartedly embraced the teachings of Confucianism, surpassing even the Ming and other Chinese emperors in his sincerity. He diligently fulfilled both the ritual and political duties of a monarch, striving to live and rule according to Confucian ideals. He listened to his ministers and prioritized the welfare of his people. Despite his conscientious efforts to govern and address the empire&#x27;s problems, he lacked grand plans or a clear vision.

Unlike the Chenghua Emperor, who had not met with his ministers since 1469, the Hongzhi Emperor changed this attitude and resumed regular audiences in 1497. His government was dominated by civil officials who held more influence than the eunuchs and led military campaigns. He refrained from using harsh punishments against officials. Some Confucian historians have even compared his reign, particularly the early years, to the golden age of the sage rulers of antiquity. He actively worked to heal and streamline the state administration, presiding over daily morning audiences as one of his primary duties as emperor. However, his frail health often made it difficult for him to fulfill his duties.

He consistently followed the advice of the Grand Secretaries, only making decisions on a few personal matters and stubbornly maintaining his independence in those matters. However, as time went on and he was influenced by the empress and her family, he began to make more decisions independently. These decisions included supporting certain Buddhists and Taoists, as well as promoting and giving gifts to a select few individuals. This did not diminish the political power of the Grand Secretariat or the government&#x27;s high morale. 

During the Hongzhi era, two important works were compiled to supplement the Ming Code: &quot;Da-Ming huidian&quot; () and &quot;Wenxing tiaoli&quot; (). These works, which contained 297 articles, were completed in March 1500. However, the editors of the first work were criticized for not addressing the role of eunuchs and regulating their rights, which allowed for their illegal activities to continue. These compilations were the result of years of effort by officials who were dissatisfied with the state of the legal system, with the goal of making slight improvements.

The Hongzhi Emperor&#x27;s devotion to Confucianism was unprecedented and unusual; even as emperor, he took his studies seriously and organized debates on political issues based on classical precedents. He also did not neglect the artistic aspect of education, as he was a skilled painter and calligrapher. Despite his mistakes, officials who were faithful to Confucian ideology overlooked and excused them due to his approach.

==Society==
===Economy and culture===
During the Hongzhi era, China experienced numerous natural disasters, particularly towards the end of the 1490s. In the 1480s, a severe drought struck the empire, followed by floods in northern China in the early 1490s, with one particularly devastating flood in 1492. As a result, the emperor granted tax forgiveness on 3.5 million liters of wheat. The floods on the Yellow River, which had been ongoing since the late 1480s, caused the dam in Shandong to collapse, resulting in widespread destruction. In 1493, an expert named Liu Daxia was finally given the task of finding a solution to the problem. He enlisted the help of local experts and successfully regulated the river from Kaifeng, redirecting the main flow southeast to Suzhou in northern Jiangsu and then through the river bed of the Huai River, effectively preventing future floods in Shandong. The project involved 120,000 men and took two years to complete. Liu&#x27;s success earned him a place in history and the favor of the emperor, leading to his promotion to the position of Minister of War (1501–1506). He became a trusted confidant of the emperor during the final years of the Hongzhi Emperor&#x27;s reign.

Despite the challenges of drought, floods, and crop failures, the economy thrived under the Hongzhi Emperor&#x27;s rule. However, there was a growing concentration of land in the hands of the powerful, particularly in both metropolitan areas, which began in the mid-15th century. While the emperor reduced tributary relations with Southeast Asia, private foreign trade with the region flourished due to the lack of government enforcement. 

In Suzhou, wealthy families began to rival the nobility in their patronage of the arts, leading to the flourishing of the Wu School of painting, which included renowned artists such as Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming, Tang Yin, and Qiu Ying. Grand Secretary Li Dongyang held great influence in matters of painting, calligraphy, and poetry, and the emperor himself was a patron of Shen Du () and other court painters, such as Lü Ji.

===Tea trade===
Due to conflicts with the Turpan over Hami, the army was in need of horses. As a solution, the emperor agreed to revive the state&#x27;s practice of exchanging tea for horses, in order to combat the illegal private sale of tea to Tibetan and Mongolian tribes in the northwest. The plan involved licensed traders transporting tea from Sichuan to Gansu border towns, with 40% of the tea (400,000 &quot;jin&quot;, approximately 240 tons) being handed over to the authorities and the rest being sold by the traders themselves. The government&#x27;s goal was to obtain 4,000 horses through this exchange, but the merchants would often take the inferior quality tea and keep the higher quality tea for themselves, resulting in the officials receiving subpar horses from the Tibetans in exchange.

In 1494, after a famine in Shaanxi, the emperor offered 2 million &quot;jin&quot; (around 1,200 tons) of tea from state reserves to merchants in exchange for rice to be sent to the affected regions. In the following years, the practice of exchanging tea for horses was discontinued and instead, merchants were offered 4 million &quot;jin&quot; of tea. In 1501, the emperor ordered 4–5 million &quot;jin&quot; of tea to be sold for silver, which was then used by the authorities to purchase grain for Shaanxi. However, this decision hindered the exchange of tea for horses, leading the emperor to ban the exchange of tea for grain in 1502. Despite these efforts, the government struggled to obtain high-quality tea to exchange for high-quality horses, and as a result, merchants continued to independently export tea across the border, bypassing the state&#x27;s control.

===Currency===
Since the closure of the mints in the 1430s, there has been a worsening shortage of coins and coppers over time. In the early 16th century, privately produced coins replaced the state-issued coins from the early Ming and the remaining Tang and Song dynasties. 

By the end of the 15th century, copper coins were mainly in circulation in the north, while silver had replaced them in the south. A revenue record of 1481 mentions that coins were only used in North and South Zhili, Henan and Shandong, which are all located along the Grand Canal. Similarly, a record of 1503 states that coins were used in the same areas, but not in Fujian, Guangdong (although they were still in use at the time of the record; private and highly valued Song coins were used), Yunnan, Guizhou, and other inland regions. In Jiangxi and Huguang, rice, grain, silver, and cloth were used as currency, while in the more underdeveloped northwest (in Shaanxi and Shanxi), skin was used and in the southwest (Yunnan), cowrie shells were used.

Merchants also exported Ming private coins abroad. However, paradoxically, while these coins were accepted as currency and recognized officially abroad, the Ming government stubbornly refused to acknowledge them in China. In the early 16th century, the Ming government discovered that proper state coins had disappeared from the market and resumed minting in 1503. The main purpose of this measure was to push the private coins out of Jiangnan, where they were particularly widespread. The government attempted to support its own coinage by issuing a decree that halved the value of coins from previous dynasties and reiterating the ban on private coinage. Despite these efforts and the significant amount of production, state coins failed to gain dominance in the market. Furthermore, the technical process of producing copper coins was problematic as their casting was expensive and officials did not have access to qualified experts, leading them to even use detained counterfeiters.

==Military and foreign policy==
===Army reforms===
The Hongzhi Emperor was likely the first Ming emperor who did not seek military glory or strive to match the accomplishments of his predecessors. He saw himself as a Confucian ruler who should gain superiority over neighboring nations through the power of virtue rather than weapons, and thus he generally avoided aggressive actions. The only notable military campaigns during his reign were the expedition to Hami in 1495 and the suppression of several minor rebellions. He did consider a potential expedition to the northern frontier, but was ultimately dissuaded by his ministers and grand secretaries. 

In contrast to the late Chenghua Emperor&#x27;s reign, where the Beijing garrison, including the twelve training divisions, was controlled by eunuchs, the Hongzhi Emperor handed command over to civil officials in 1487 and overall command to Ma Wensheng, an official with considerable experience in leading troops on the northern frontier.

Instead of relying solely on hereditary soldiers from the &quot;Weisuo&quot; system, the army increasingly turned to hiring mercenaries for pay. These mercenaries were known as &quot;local soldiers&quot; (; &quot;Tubing&quot;) on the border and &quot;people&#x27;s stalwarts&quot; (; &quot;Minzhuang&quot;) inland. In 1494, the emperor officially adjusted the rules for recruiting these soldiers, which had previously been done informally since 1449. In 1502, 300,000 &quot;Minzhuang&quot; soldiers were incorporated into the &quot;Weisuo&quot; units to strengthen them. In 1464, special examinations were introduced for selecting officers, but it was not until the 1470s that this became more widespread. However, the emperor was dissatisfied with the results of these examinations as they did not reveal officers with exceptional talent. In 1496, he called on local officials to find such men, but this effort proved unsuccessful.

===Unrest in the southwest and south===
During the reign of the Hongzhi Emperor, unrest continued to plague the southwest region of the Ming dynasty. One of the most significant disturbances during the late 15th century was the rebellion led by a woman named Mi-lu from the Lolo tribe, which took place on the border of Guizhou and Yunnan from 1499 to 1502. The suppression of this rebellion required the mobilization of troops from four provinces and 80,000 members of local tribes. 

The Li rebellion in Hainan from 1500 to 1503 was a significant event. It was sparked by the overreach of Chinese officials and led by tribal leaders, resulting in rebels from the inland mountains attacking Chinese residents in the coastal plains. As the government debated the best course of action, Feng Yu, a secretary in the Ministry of Revenue who was a Han Chinese native of Hainan, suggested placing local administration under the control of hereditary Li chiefs instead of Chinese authorities, which had been the norm until the Chenghua era. Although the proposal was approved, the rebellion was ultimately quelled through military force, resulting in heavy losses for both Chinese and Mongol troops.

===Central Asia===
In the previous reign, the Hongzhi Emperor&#x27;s ministers inherited enmity with the Sultan of Turpan, who had captured Hami, an important city on the Silk Road west of China, much to their displeasure. In 1489, Ming diplomacy began to organize anti-Turpan actions, and in 1495, the Ming intervened militarily. A Sino-Mongol army conquered Hami and installed a Uighur prince on the throne. However, the Turpans were able to recapture the city before the end of the same year. In response, the Ming government completely halted trade along the Silk Road, forcing the Turpans to yield. In 1499, the Uyghur prince was once again installed in Hami. This success was likely due to the influence of the experienced military minister Ma Wensheng, who had served in the northwest in his youth and had a better understanding of the situations beyond the Great Wall than other Beijing statesmen. However, the Uyghur prince&#x27;s incompetence caused tension among his subjects, leading to continued instability. 

The Ming government continued to interfere in Hami affairs in the first decade of the 16th century, but their influence gradually weakened.

==Death and legacy==
On 1 June 1505, the Hongzhi Emperor fell ill and died a few days later, on 8 June. He was given the temple name Xiaozong, meaning &quot;Filial Ancestor&quot;, in recognition of his dedication to Confucian virtues, and the posthumous name Emperor Jing (; &#x27;Respectful Emperor&#x27;). He was buried in the Tai Mausoleum in the Ming tombs near Beijing. 

His thirteen-year-old son, the Zhengde Emperor, succeeded him on 19 June 1505. Despite his father&#x27;s love and early appointment as successor in 1492, the son held opposing views on many issues. In comparison to his son&#x27;s rejection of Confucian values, the Hongzhi Emperor was remembered by Chinese intellectuals as an ideal ruler.

The &quot;History of Ming&quot; has recognized him as one of the commendable rulers, as out of the sixteen Ming emperors, only the Hongxi, Xuande, and Hongzhi emperors were deemed worthy of recognition besides the Hongwu and Yongle emperors. During his reign, border defenses were strengthened, tax administration was improved, and a spirit of openness and cooperation was fostered within the government. 

The Hongzhi Emperor&#x27;s rule is traditionally viewed as a time of harmonious relations between the emperor and the government. Confucian scholars praised him as a model ruler and downplayed his flaws, particularly his favoritism towards the empress and her unworthy relatives. The emperor actively advised officials, leading to improved relations with them. However, no changes were made to the structure of the highest offices, allowing for a swift rise in the abuse of eunuch power under the subsequent emperors, Zhengde and Jiajing.

==Family==
In contrast to almost all of his predecessors, who had many consorts and concubines and fathered many children, the Hongzhi Emperor had only one empress, Empress Zhang. His empress gave birth to two sons, but the second one died at a young age. The Hongzhi Emperor showed a lot of love to his first son, which he himself lacked in his childhood. However, the boy seemed to rebel against the emperor&#x27;s teachings in his heart, if not openly. According to the &quot;History of Ming&quot;, on his deathbed, the Hongzhi Emperor summoned his officials and entrusted them with the care of his son, who was only thirteen at the time. He was described as intelligent, but too inclined towards entertainment and pleasure.
Consorts and issue:
* Empress Xiaochengjing, of the Zhang clan (; 1471–1541)
** Zhu Houzhao, the Zhengde Emperor (; 27 October 1491 – 20 April 1521), first son
** Princess Taikang (; 1494 – 1 October 1498), personal name Xiurong (), first daughter
** Zhu Houwei, Prince Dao of Wei (; 1 January 1495 – 9 March 1496), second son

<doc id="390588" wikidata="Q531628" url="?curid=390588" title="Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff">
<text>Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff or Seckendorf (December 20, 1626December 18, 1692), German statesman and scholar, was a member of the House of Seckendorff, a noble family which took its name from the village of Seckendorf between Nuremberg and Langenzenn.
The family was divided into eleven distinct lines, widely distributed throughout Prussia, Württemberg, and Bavaria.

== Biography ==
Seckendorf, a son of Joachim Ludwig von Seckendorf, was born at Herzogenaurach, near Erlangen. In 1639, the reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Ernest the Pious, made him his &quot;protégé&quot;, and he was educated at the Ernestine Gymnasium, Gotha. His father, was actively engaged in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and was executed at Salzwedel in 1642 for his dealings with the Imperialists of the Holy Roman Empire. Entering the University of Strasbourg in 1642, the means for Seckendorf&#x27;s higher education came from Swedish officers who were former comrades of his father. He devoted himself to history and jurisprudence, and at the end of his university years Duke Ernest gave him a position as &quot;hofjunker&quot; in his court at Gotha, where Seckendorf laid the foundation of his great collection of historical materials and mastered the principal modern languages.

In 1652, Seckendorf was appointed to judicial positions and also sent on foreign missions. In 1656, he was made a judge in the ducal court at Jena and took the leading part in the numerous beneficent reforms of the duke. In 1664, Duke Ernest made him his chancellor, but soon afterwards he resigned his offices at Jena, while remaining on excellent terms with its Duke, and entered the service of Duke Maurice of Zeitz (Altenburg), with the intention of lightening his official duties.

After the death of Maurice in 1681, Seckendorf retired to his estate, Meuselwitz in Altenburg, resigning nearly all his public offices. Although living in retirement, he kept up a correspondence with the principal learned men of the day. He was especially interested in the endeavours of the pietist Philipp Jakob Spener to effect a practical reform of the German church, although he was hardly himself a pietist. In 1692, he was appointed chancellor of the new University of Halle, but he died a few weeks afterwards.

Seckendorf&#x27;s principal works were the following:
*&quot;Teutscher Fürstenstaat&quot; (1656 and 1678), a handbook of German public law
*&quot;Der Christen Stat&quot; (1685), partly an apology for Christianity and partly suggestions for the reformation of the church, founded on Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Pensées&quot; and embodying the fundamental ideas of Spener
*&quot;Commentarius Historicus et apologeticus de Lutheranismo sive de Reformatione&quot; (3 vols., Leipzig, 1692), occasioned by the Jesuit Maimbourg&#x27;s &quot;Histoire du Luthéranisme&quot; (Paris, 1680), his most important work, and still indispensable to the historian of the Reformation as a rich storehouse of authentic materials.

==Economic writings==
Seckendorff is widely regarded as the &quot;founder&quot; of early economics in Germany of Cameralism. Having survived the horrors of the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the resulting economic, political and moral breakdown of society, Seckendorff conceived of a holistic science of public administration fit to reconstruct the more than 300 independent German principalities recognized by the Peace of Westphalia. The science he envisioned was both theoretical and practical, covering all the needs of a small principality. The same union of active and contemplative characterizes Seckendorff&#x27;s own life, as he devoted himself both to administrating the Court of Gotha and the University of Halle, both to write an &quot;owner&#x27;s handbook&quot; (&quot;Teutscher Fürstenstaat&quot;, &quot;The German Principality&quot;) to small principalities and one of the most celebrated defenses of Lutheranism.

== Thought ==
In his principal work, &quot;Teutsche&quot; &quot;Fürsten Staaten&quot;, a handbook of civil administration, Seckendorff created what is considered the seminal work of German Cameralism. In it, he described the situation of the country, the government institutions, and Seckendorff&#x27;s recommended way to manage the prince&#x27;s holdings, including his demesne and monopolies, so as to maximize state revenues. Seckendorff held a paternalistic view of the economy, advocating state involvement in population growth, education, usury prevention, trade regulation, contract law, and resource allocation.

Seckendorff is termed a &quot;quasi-absolutist&quot; by Albion Small, in the sense that he did not believe the old view that the will of the prince was the will of God, but he did believe God was the only power authorized to discipline the prince. With view to economics, Small terms Seckendorff &quot;the Adam Smith of cameralism.&quot;

In Seckendorff, government consists in maintenance of the common advantage of things spiritual and material, with the final end of human actions being the glory of God, with the authorities serving as &quot;God&#x27;s deputies.&quot; This includes the religious duties of the prince, restored by the Reformation. 

To Seckendorff, the four chief duties of the prince are: (1) establish power as a means of suppressing disorder, (2) establish good laws and ordinances to promote righteousness and peace, (3) serve as supreme adjudicator, (4) use all means necessary in the establishment of institutions to protect the foregoing activities from foreign and domestic enemies. 

According to Seckendorff, subjects are not slaves of the ruler or the state; rather, they are under the government of (divinely-appointed) authorities so that their welfare and souls are protected according to both natural and imperial law. The government is to &quot;cherish&quot; its subjects. Nevertheless, the dignity of government is treated as an end in itself.

<text>The Zhengde Emperor (26 October 149120 April 1521), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Wuzong of Ming, personal name Zhu Houzhao, was the 11th emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1505 to 1521. He succeeded his father, the Hongzhi Emperor.

The Zhengde Emperor was the eldest and only surviving son of the Hongzhi Emperor. As the crown prince, he received a Confucian education and was known for his intelligence during his studies. However, upon taking power, it became evident that he had a strong aversion to the Confucian-oriented bureaucracy and rejected the rituals and duties associated with it. He frequently clashed with ministers and great secretaries, instead relying on eunuchs, particularly the &quot;Eight Tigers&quot;, with whom he had grown up. From 1506 to 1510, the eunuch Liu Jin effectively controlled the government, appointing his allies and supporters to important positions. The emperor even moved out of the Forbidden City to the newly built &quot;Leopard Quarter&quot; where he surrounded himself with eunuchs and officers. After Liu Jin&#x27;s downfall, the actor Zang Xian () and officers Qian Ning and Jiang Bin became the emperor&#x27;s favorites, while Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe managed the general administration.

The administration of Liu Jin was marked by high tax pressure and a decline in the government&#x27;s authority, which ultimately led to multiple large-scale rebellions. These included the Prince of Anhua rebellion, the rebellion in northern China that began in 1510, and the Prince of Ning rebellion. The latter was eventually quelled by Wang Yangming, a prominent neo-Confucian philosopher.

As the emperor and eunuchs became increasingly interested in sources of income, they lifted the ban on private foreign trade. This coincided with the arrival of Portuguese sailors in southern China, who began trading with Chinese partners.

In 1517, the emperor spent the majority of his time on the Sino-Mongol border northwest of Beijing, primarily in the garrison town of Datong. During this time, he successfully repelled a major Mongol raid led by Dayan Khan. In 1519, he traveled to Nanjing and remained there for most of 1520. However, on his return journey, he fell into the water while drunk, became ill, and died a few months later. 

As the Zhengde Emperor did not have any children, Yang Tinghe, with the support of the deceased emperor&#x27;s mother, Empress Dowager Zhang, placed his closest male relative, Zhu Houcong, on the throne. Zhu Houcong was only thirteen years old and the son of the Hongzhi Emperor&#x27;s younger brother, Zhu Youyuan.

Zhu Houzhao, the future Zhengde Emperor, was born on 14 November 1491 as the eldest son of the Hongzhi Emperor, who ruled as the ninth emperor of the Ming dynasty from 1487. His mother was Empress Zhang, the only wife of the Hongzhi Emperor. In 1492, the Hongzhi Emperor named him crown prince. The father saw himself in his son and took him with him when he traveled, supporting his interests in riding and archery, and pampering him. The Crown Prince was an excellent student, fulfilling his duties with care and courtesy.

The Hongzhi Emperor died on 8 June 1505. On his deathbed, he called upon his closest aides, Grand Secretaries Liu Jian (), Li Dongyang, and Xie Qian (), to faithfully serve his son. He assessed Zhu Houzhao as an intelligent young man, but also fond of comfort and pleasure. Therefore, he asked them to guide him on the right path. 

On 19 June 1505, Zhu Houzhao ascended the throne as the tenth Ming emperor. His era name, Zhengde, comes from a quote from the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; and means &quot;the rectification (&quot;zheng&quot;) of &quot;the people&#x27;s&quot; virtue (&quot;de&quot;)&quot;.

==Style of government==

Upon ascending to the throne, the Zhengde Emperor was confronted with three major issues that had been passed down to him: insufficient state revenue, a vulnerable military presence on the northwestern border with the Mongols, and conflicts between the imperial eunuchs and officials regarding problem-solving methods. The emperor tended to side with the eunuchs, disregarding the counsel of the Grand Secretaries. This disagreement between the ruler and his officials was partly due to a generational gap, as the Zhengde Emperor was young and the youngest Grand Secretary was fifty-six years old.

In contrast to his father, who exercised imperial authority sparingly, delegated power effectively, and dutifully fulfilled his responsibilities, the Zhengde Emperor showed little concern for state affairs. His restless spirit rebelled against official orthodoxy and he disregarded the meticulously prescribed ceremonial and ritual duties of an emperor. He resisted the objections and demands of officials, but readily fulfilled the requests and desires of the eunuchs. In the early years of his reign, he actively avoided official audiences and discussions on Confucian topics. This behavior was seen as a major concern for the Confucian-minded bureaucracy, as they believed that a monarch who adhered to all ceremonies, precedents, and duties was crucial for the functioning of the state. However, the Zhengde Emperor had a wide range of other interests, including riding, archery, hunting, and music. He was particularly fond of composing songs and singing, and he promoted music throughout the court. He also enjoyed playing games with his eunuchs, leading to the establishment of several imperial shops run by them. He supported various forms of entertainment, such as wrestling, acrobatics, magic, and fireworks. He often indulged in these activities with the eunuchs, neglecting his studies and getting drunk for days on end. He even refused to attend to state affairs, much to the dismay of the officials. In fact, he would often roam the streets of Beijing incognito in search of entertainment, causing great consternation among the officials.

One year after his accession, he married a daughter from an officer&#x27;s family with the surname Xia and made her empress. He also took two other girls as consorts. However, he soon stopped living with the empress. At the suggestion of Yu Yong (), a guard officer in Embroidered Uniform Guard who was of Central Asian origin, he summoned Uyghur dancers. His unrestrained behavior regularly shocked Confucian moralists, but it also made him famous in popular folklore.

Like his grandfather, the Chenghua Emperor, the Zhengde Emperor was drawn to Lamaism. He built a new temple for Tibetan monks in the Forbidden City and awarded them high titles and rewards. He also learned their script and participated in their ceremonies, even dressing in Tibetan clothing. He even involved them in the rituals at the funeral of Empress Wang (the wife of his grandfather, the Chenghua Emperor) in 1518.

He held a negative view of officials, viewing them as corrupt and incompetent. As a result, he entrusted state affairs to eunuchs, appointing them to military and financial positions from the beginning of his reign. He actively avoided interacting with officials and instead relied on eunuchs to handle matters, as they never questioned his orders. He also valued their intelligence and entrusted them with supervising the armies on the borders and quelling rebellions within the country. They were also responsible for overseeing the production of silk and porcelain goods, as well as managing regional authorities. The emperor generously rewarded them for their services, often granting their relatives aristocratic titles.

The emperor&#x27;s financial irresponsibility worsened the already dire state of state finances. While the Ministry of Revenue theoretically brought in 1.5 million &quot;liang&quot; in silver (equivalent to about 56 tons), the actual amount was much lower due to tax remissions and arrears. In the first year of his reign, the emperor spent 1.4 million &quot;liang&quot; on donations and rewards, disregarding the advice of conservative officials who urged austerity. The eunuchs, on the other hand, were resourceful in finding new sources of revenue, such as transit taxes, taxes on pastures and wastelands, and levies on imperial estates. This further strengthened the emperor&#x27;s support for the eunuchs.

==Court under Liu Jin==
Concerned about the emperor&#x27;s actions and the influence of the eunuchs, a group of high officials, led by Grand Secretaries Liu Jian and Xie Qian, formed an alliance with prominent eunuchs. They accused the eunuchs in the emperor&#x27;s inner circle, known as the &quot;Eight Tigers&quot; (including Liu Jin and seven others), who had been promoted in 1505, of wrongdoing. The officials demanded that Liu Jin be executed and the others punished. The eunuchs, feeling threatened by the rise of the &quot;Eight Tigers&quot;, initially only wanted Liu Jin to be transferred to the south, but on 27 October 1506, the Minister of Revenue, Han Wen (), petitioned for the execution of all eight. The emperor refused, but agreed to punish them. However, at the last minute, the &quot;Eight Tigers&quot; convinced the emperor that their accusers were conspiring against them in an attempt to gain power. Enraged, the emperor exiled the eunuchs who had allied with Liu–Xie group and promoted the members of the &quot;Eight Tigers&quot;. Liu Jian, Xie Qian, and others were forced to resign, while Li Dongyang remained in the Grand Secretariat, joined by Jiao Fang (; 1436–1517), an ally of Liu Jin who had informed him of the accusations and other allies of the &quot;Eight Tigers&quot;.
From October 1506 to September 1510, the eunuch-official alliance, led by Liu Jin, dominated the court. During the initial months of his rule, Liu Jin eliminated his opponents from the Beijing authorities. In December 1506, Han Wen was dismissed due to accusations of abuse of power, and in February 1507, twenty-one officials who protested against the resignation of the Grand Secretaries were punished. Other officials were beaten, torture, and dismissal. By the summer of 1507, Liu Jin had complete control over the government, and no important documents were approved without his consent.

So far, the emperor has been spending without any restrictions. In September 1507, he paid 350 thousand &quot;liang&quot; (13 tons) of silver just for the lanterns for the Lantern Festival. Additionally, the buildings in the imperial park south of Beijing were rebuilt, and he even built the &quot;Leopard Quarter&quot; (&quot;Bao Fang&quot;) northwest of the Forbidden City. As a result, Liu Jin focused on increasing the emperor&#x27;s income. He used the threat of heavy fines to force the officials responsible for finances and taxes to bring in the exact amount of money to Beijing. This caused great concern among government officials, as he also demanded levies and supplies from officials on the northern border and Beijing, which left their families impoverished. Furthermore, his agents extorted additional silver payments from mines in Fujian and Sichuan, and even organized illegal sales of salt beyond the quotas. When officials arrested them, they were arrested themselves.

The influence of the eunuchs continued to grow, as evidenced by the fact that in March 1507, the eunuch intendants in the provinces were granted equal status to the leading provincial officials. This gave them the authority to handle administrative and legal matters. Liu Jin attempted to reorganize the administration of the empire based on the principle of equality or even subordination of civilian and military officials to eunuchs. These reforms sparked strong opposition from officials, who were forced to comply through brutal terror. He also faced hostility from other eunuchs, including the remaining seven &quot;Tigers&quot;. In response, he established a new agency to investigate the resistance among the eunuchs.

While Liu Jin focused on governing the state, the emperor indulged in the pleasures of the new &quot;Leopard Quarter&quot;, surrounded by flattering eunuchs, officers, musicians, lamas, and beauties. The emperor had particular favorites, including Qian Ning, an officer of the &quot;Embroidered Uniformed Guards&quot; known for his strength and archery skills, and actor Zang Xian, who was appointed deputy director of the Music Bureau for his musical talent. These favorites held significant influence over many officials and office seekers.

==Prince of Anhua rebellion and the fall of Liu Jin==

Improving state income through higher taxation of military households caused widespread discontent in the borderlands. This led to a rebellion in Liaodong, which was eventually quelled by distributing 2,500 &quot;liang&quot; of silver among the malcontents. Zhu Zhifan, Prince of Anhua, took advantage of the discontent and attempted to seize power during rebellion in May 1510. Zhu Zhifan resided in Ningxia, a crucial fortress city on the Mongolian-Chinese border in northwestern Shaanxi. This city served as the headquarters for one of the nine border military regions. Believing himself to be a potential candidate for the throne, Zhu Zhifan gathered a group of loyalists, including officers from the Ningxia garrison and members of the local gentry. In the spring of 1510, he gained the support of other officers and on 12 May, he took control of Ningxia and its surrounding areas, declaring a campaign against Liu Jin. However, the rebellion did not spread as the commanders of the garrisons in Lingzhou and Yansui opposed the rebels. By 30 May, the prince was captured a pro-government general, who had apparently joined the uprising. The rebellion quickly collapsed and all the rebels were captured within days.
Meanwhile, the emperor, after consulting with his Grand Secretaries and ministers, implemented a comprehensive set of counterinsurgency measures. He appointed Shen Ying (), Earl of Jingyang, and Yang Yiqing, Censor-in-chief, to oversee the situation in Ningxia. Both had previous experience in the region, making them well-equipped to handle the task successfully. In addition, he promoted several officers from the Ningxia garrison, offered amnesty to lower-ranking rebels, and promised rewards for those who returned to the government&#x27;s side. He also allocated a significant sum of money for this purpose. As a precaution, he granted amnesty for minor offenses to all princes. Furthermore, he dispatched the eunuch Zhang Yong (one of the &quot;Eight Tigers&quot;) to Ningxia with a force of 30,000 soldiers from the Beijing garrison. This was the first time in the history of the Ming dynasty that a eunuch had been given a separate command. To support the troops in Xuanfu, Datong, and Yansui, the commanders were provided with a million &quot;liang&quot; of silver to cover the costs of troop movements.

During the campaign, Yang Yiqing convinced Zhang Yong to turn against Liu Jin by warning him that his life was in danger due to Liu Jin&#x27;s plans for another coup. Upon returning to Beijing, Zhang Yong joined forces with the other six &quot;Tigers&quot; and on 13 September 1510, they accused Liu Jin of plotting against the emperor. It was reported that Liu Jin intended to assassinate the emperor and place his own great-nephew on the throne. Despite the emperor&#x27;s initial reluctance to believe the accusations, the group was able to persuade him. The following day, Liu Jin was transferred to Nanjing and his property were seized. When the emperor saw the vast amount of weapons and treasures that Liu had accumulated, he ordered his execution, despite Liu&#x27;s insistence on his innocence. On 16 September, Liu Jin was arrested and his three-day execution began on 27 September.

As a result of Liu&#x27;s downfall, his allies were also removed, and his reforms were reversed. Any documents related to his proposed reforms were destroyed, effectively rendering his efforts to change the administrative structure of the Ming Empire and increase the emperor&#x27;s direct control through eunuch officials futile.

==Rebellions in northern and central China==

The northern provinces of the Ming Empire were relatively poor, despite the presence of the capital city, and even the North Zhili metropolitan area was impoverished. Many poor people from the surrounding areas of Beijing chose to be castrated in hopes of gaining wealth and influence as eunuchs in the emperor&#x27;s court. During the Zhengde era, over 3,500 eunuchs applied for positions in the Forbidden City, but only a small percentage were successful. The majority of unsuccessful applicants were forced to live on the fringes of society or turn to a life of crime. The presence of imperial estates, the land of the imperial family, and the aristocracy further exacerbated the problems in the northern region. According to modern estimates, these estates covered 15–40% of the land in the North Zhili erea. These estates were often beyond the control of local authorities, as they were responsible for collecting taxes and levies themselves, which amounted to about a third of the harvest. On the other hand, the owners of these estates preferred to manage them directly, often hiring eunuchs and administrators to oversee their operations. These administrators often recruited individuals who were not registered in official population records, including deserters and local criminals.

In the summer of 1509, the security situation south of Beijing deteriorated as Liu Jin&#x27;s attempts to raise levies on military households resulted in desertions. This led to banded deserters plundering the countryside. In 1510, a large number of these deserters organized into a unified group based in Wen&#x27;an, located 130 km south of Beijing, and began planning a rebellion. Although their leader was captured, the rebellion still flared up. By February 1511, the rebels had amassed several thousand horsemen and were attacking cities. However, the government&#x27;s army sent to stop them was ineffective. The officials leading the troops preferred negotiations, and the soldiers avoided fighting. In August 1511, the rebels even besieged Wen&#x27;an. Reinforcements were called in from the borderlands and the command was changed, but there was no success. In fact, in one ambush, the bandits burned a thousand ships that were importing grain to the capital via the Grand Canal. In November 1511, the command of the government troops was once again changed, but it had little impact. In January 1512, the rebels launched an attack on Bazhou, which is located 100 km south of Beijing. The army received reinforcements from the borderlands—Xuanfu, Datong, and Liaodong—but it was not until the summer of 1512 that the rebels were finally defeated. Some of them retreated south across the Yangtze River to Jiangxi, while others went east to Shandong, and the remaining rebels headed southwest to the city of Wuhan on the Yangtze River. From there, with a force of 800 men, they sailed downstream and plundered before being destroyed by a typhoon off Tongzhou on 28 August and they were slaughtered by a government force at Langshan, near the mouth of the Yangtze River, on 7 September 1512. This event marked the formal end of the campaign.

The security and supply of the capital were no longer under threat, but banditry continued to be a problem in Jiangxi, Henan, and central Sichuan. The first instance of trouble with rebels occurred in Sichuan in 1508. By 1509, these rebels had joined forces with those from Shanxi, forming a single army of 100,000 men. This posed a threat not only to the security of Huguang, but also to the surrounding areas. The rebel leaders declared themselves kings (&quot;wang&quot;) and began to establish their own administrative systems. Another group of rebels was active in southern Sichuan and carried out raids in Guizhou and northern Sichuan. The government attempted to use non-Chinese tribes to fight against the rebels, but the Miao tribes instead joined forces with the southern Sichuan rebels. Despite this, the government was able to gradually suppress the rebellion in Sichuan and ultimately eliminate it by 1514.

In 1511, there were also rebel groups in the mountains of Jiangxi, which were eventually defeated with the help of mercenaries from non-Chinese tribes from neighboring provinces in 1513. In 1517, another rebellion erupted in the south of Jiangxi, and Wang Yangming was sent to the area as a grand coordinator to restore order in 1518.

==New favorites: Qian Ning and Jiang Bin==
After the downfall of Liu Jin, the emperor faced financial difficulties and, due to the refusal of officials to change the established order, he turned to eunuchs for extraordinary acquisitions. Those who opposed this were harshly punished. One of the leading eunuchs was Wei Bin, who took over the Directorate of Ceremonial. The emperor&#x27;s attention was also drawn to military matters and officers due to problems with bandits near the capital. Among the officers, Qian Ning, the commander of the palace guard, became the emperor&#x27;s favorite. He impressed the emperor with his archery and military skills, and later by catering to his personal preferences by procuring musicians, Muslim women for the harem, and Tibetan monks who were experts in tantric Buddhism.

In 1512, a twenty-year-old officer named Jiang Bin from the Xuanfu garrison caught the attention of the emperor after his bravery in a battle against rebels the previous year. Despite being hit by three arrows, including one in the ear, Jiang Bin continued to fight and became the emperor&#x27;s new favorite. He proposed a rotation of units, suggesting that experienced soldiers from the borderlands be brought to Beijing to fight the rebels, while the soldiers from the capital would be sent to the borders instead. However, Grand Secretary Li Dongyang strongly opposed this idea, arguing that the soldiers from Beijing lacked combat experience and would struggle on the border, while the border guards would struggle to maintain order in the capital. Li Dongyang resigned in protest in February 1513 after the emperor refused to listen to his objections. Despite this, the emperor went ahead with the plan and the first soldiers from Xuanfu began serving in Beijing in February 1513.

Border guards were stationed in four camps within the Imperial City area, with the Zhengde Emperor viewing them as his personal army and considering himself their general. He had a particular fondness for four officers—Jiang Bin, Xu Tai (), Shen Zhou, and Liu Hui (). He entrusted the first two with the command of the Beijing garrison, including the newly arrived units. Gradually, he developed a taste for military finery and uniforms, even personally training a group of eunuchs in military skills. In addition to his military pursuits, the emperor also enjoyed hunting. However, in September 1514, he was injured by a tiger, which left him bedridden for a month. Despite this, he remained unwilling to give up his pleasures and instead transferred officials who advised him to be more cautious outside of Beijing.

The Zhengde Emperor had a great love for lanterns. In early 1514, his distant relative Zhu Chenhao, Prince of Ning, presented him with several hundred new lanterns and experts to install them for the New Year celebrations. However, the emperor had yurts built in front of the palace for military exercises, some of which stored gunpowder. During the celebrations on 10 February 1514, the dust from the lanterns accidentally exploded, causing a massive fire in the palaces of the Forbidden City. As a result, the Zhengde Emperor had a complex of 162 yurts built for himself in the Forbidden City. The restoration of the burned palaces lasted until 1521, with 30,000 soldiers from the Beijing garrison working on it and costing over 1 million &quot;liang&quot; of silver.

==Travels to the northwest==

In the beginning of 1516, the Zhengde Emperor, tired of constant criticism from officials, began to consider the idea of going to Xuanfu. Jiang Bin, in an attempt to separate the Zhengde Emperor from Qian Ning, convinced the emperor that Xuanfu had better musicians and women, and that he would have real battles with the Mongols on the border instead of simulated ones in Beijing. In mid-August 1517, the emperor finally made the journey to Xuanfu. After five days, he arrived at the Juyong Pass, located 50 km northwest of Beijing. However, the censor in charge of the pass refused to open the gate without an edict signed by both the emperess and the empress dowager. Powerless, the emperor was forced to return. He made another attempt a month later, this time passing through the pass while the censor was absent. He left a reliable eunuch, Gu Dayong, in charge with strict orders not to let any officials through. Finally, in mid-September 1517, the Zhengde Emperor arrived at Xuanfu.

Enthralled by his new surroundings, he decided to settle here and embarked on the construction of a grand mansion at a great expense. He even went as far as to abandon the use of the imperial seal and instead titled himself as a general. Despite protests from the Grand Secretaries, he disregarded their objections. He then demanded that they send him one million &quot;liang&quot; (37 tons) of silver, but they refused, citing that the Ministry of Renvenue only had a reserve of 350,000 &quot;liang&quot;. After much negotiation, the Minister of Renvenue reluctantly agreed to send 500,000 &quot;liang&quot;. In response, the Zhengde Emperor ordered the guards at the Beijing gates to prevent any officials from entering the city in January 1518.

In October 1517, the Mongol Dayan Khan led a raid into Chinese territory with 50,000 horsemen. The emperor, eager for a fight, sent an army to confront them. After a few minor skirmishes, a major battle took place on 18 October at Yingzhou, located 65 km south of Datong. The following day, the emperor arrived with reinforcements and on 20 October, he personally led a day-long battle. The Mongols were ultimately defeated and forced to retreat across the border. This was the only instance in the entire 16th century where a Ming army successfully defeated a major Mongol raid. In recognition of their bravery, the Zhengde Emperor decorated a large number of officers and soldiers, including Jiang Bin and Xu Tai who were both granted the title of count.

In mid-February 1518, the emperor returned to Beijing for a twenty-day visit. In March, he traveled to Xuanfu once again. On 22 March 1518, he returned to Beijing to arrange the funeral of Empress Dowager Wang, the widow of the Chenghua Emperor, the grandfather of the Zhengde Emperor. In May, he inspected the imperial tombs and then visited the garrison at Miyun, which is located 65 km northeast of Beijing. He then returned to Beijing for the funeral of Empress Dowager Wang, which began on 22 July. In August 1518, he forced the Grand Secretaries to write an edict naming him &quot;Zhu Shou&quot; () and granting him the titles of general and duke for his successes in fighting against the Mongols. He returned to his &quot;home&quot; in Xuanfu in September 1518, and then traveled to Datong and Yansui. In January-February 1519, he headed to Beijing via Taiyuan and arrived there in March 1519.

Upon his return, the Zhengde Emperor announced his intention to travel to Shandong and the southern region. However, his decision was met with strong opposition from the Grand Secretaries, Minister of Rites, ministers, and censors. Despite mass arrests and beatings, which resulted in the deaths of twelve or fourteen officials, the protests continued. The main concern behind the protests was not just the journey itself, but also the fear of the Prince of Ning&#x27;s potential plots to assassinate the emperor during the trip. Due to the widespread defiance of the officials, the emperor ultimately decided to postpone his trip.

==Prince of Ning rebellion==

Zhu Chenhao, Prince of Ning, belonged to a minor branch of the Ming dynasty, which was based in Nanchang, the capital of the southern Chinese province of Jiangxi. Driven by ambition and a desire for greatness, he sought to gain power and influence. In order to achieve this, he initially resorted to bribery, targeting Liu Jin. However, after Liu Jin&#x27;s downfall, his main supporters in the government were Zang Xian, Qian Ning, and Lu Wan (who served as Minister of War from 1513 to 1515, and then as Minister of Personnel). Through their help, he was able to obtain permission to establish a personal guard and gain authority over local military garrisons and members of the imperial family.

He built his own armed force from local &quot;strong men&quot;. However, his actions sparked numerous complaints from Jiangxi, with reports of land grabbing, excessive taxation, and intimidation of officials. Despite the severe punishment typically imposed on princes for even minor offenses, his behavior was overlooked. In an attempt to gain power through non-violent means, he sought to exploit the emperor&#x27;s lack of an heir. In the spring of 1516, he bribed Qian Ning and others to summon his eldest son to Beijing as a candidate for crown prince. However, this plan ultimately failed.

The Zhengde Emperor was only made aware of the issue with the Prince of Ning in the summer of 1519, when Jiang Bin and Zhang Yong convinced him of the prince&#x27;s and Qian Ning&#x27;s misconduct. The prince had received information from his spies in Beijing about unfavorable developments, prompting him to openly rebel in Nanchang on 10 July 1419. He claimed that the Zhengde Emperor was an impostor and not a member of the imperial family, and that the empress had ordered his dethronement. His vanguard departed from Nanchang and headed north, taking control of Jiujiang on the Yangtze River on 13 July and beginning the siege of Anqing (a prefectural seat on the Yangtze River, 240 km from Nanjing) on 23 July. Meanwhile, on 14 July, Wang Yangming, the governor of southern Jiangxi, learned of the rebellion and immediately began assembling an army. He also fed the prince false information about the movements of government troops and the betrayal of his closest confidants. Believing this misinformation, the prince cautiously retreated to Anqing with his main forces (consisting of 60,000–70,000 soldiers) until 26 July. However, their attempt to capture Anqing failed and resulted in heavy losses. At the same time, Wang Yangming&#x27;s army had gathered and took control of Nanchang on 14 August. The prince then returned south with his main forces, but was defeated in a three-day river battle at Lake Poyang, resulting in his capture by Wang Yangming&#x27;s army.

==Southern tour==
The rebellion of the Prince of Ning gave the Zhengde Emperor a solid justification for taking the southern tour. He departed from Beijing on 15 September 1519. He arrived in Nanjing in January 1520 and stayed there for eight months. During this time, he mostly indulged in leisure activities. While the alcohol he consumed was relatively harmless, a decree was issued shortly before his arrival in Nanjing that banned the breeding and killing of pigs. This sparked outrage among the population, as it was believed by Muslims (who held influence in the emperor&#x27;s court) that pigs were impure and could spread diseases. This ban may have also contributed to the negative perception of the phrase &quot;kill a pig&quot; among the emperor&#x27;s court, as the word for pig (Zhu, ) had the same pronunciation as the imperial family&#x27;s surname (Zhu, ). Additionally, the emperor&#x27;s habit of taking women for himself caused resentment among his subjects. Some women were forced into the imperial harem, while others were able to buy their way out or bribe officials who were extorting women from their households. However, many women ended up in the imperial laundries in Beijing. The sheer number of women was overwhelming, leading to overcrowding and lack of resources, resulting in cases of malnutrition and even starvation. Furthermore, the emperor&#x27;s frequent hunting trips with a large entourage in the densely populated south were deeply unpopular among the people.

The emperor dispatched soldiers from the north, led by Jiang Bin and the eunuch Zhang Yong, to Jiangxi. Their goal was to prevent Wang Yanming from achieving victory by staging a fake battle and capturing the prince on behalf of the emperor. However, Wang Yangming refused to cooperate and instead worked to minimize the impact of the troops&#x27; presence in Jiangxi, earning him widespread admiration.

During the prince&#x27;s trial, all of his associates were charged, but Wang Yangming had the foresight to destroy most of the prince&#x27;s records, which documented his dealings with local elites. This ensured that only the main conspirators could be prosecuted. Zang Xian and Qian Ning were arrested in December 1519, followed by the arrest of minister Lu Wan and a group of eunuchs and imperial guards in December 1520. All of them were subsequently executed.

==Return to the north, illness, and death==
The Zhengde Emperor remained in Nanjing until 23 September 1520, before departing for the north. However, his journey was plagued by constant drunkenness, which ultimately took a toll on him on 25 October. While fishing in Qingjiangpu (in present-day Huaiyin), his boat capsized and he was rescued by helpers. His excessive alcohol consumption had already weakened his health, and he fell seriously ill. Despite his condition, he continued his journey without stopping until he reached Tongzhou, located east of Beijing, in December 1520.

The emperor was gravely ill and his death was imminent. Jiang Bin requested a transfer to Xuanfu in order to have control over succession decisions while the emperor was away from officials. However, the emperor&#x27;s condition was too weak. Eventually, the doctor convinced him to travel to Beijing for better recovery before his next trip. On 18 January 1521, he arrived in Beijing with great ceremony. Just three days later, while performing a ritual at the Temple of Heaven, he collapsed and had to be carried back to the palace. He died three months later on 20 April 1521 in the Leopard Quarter. He was given the temple name Wuzong and the posthumous name Emperor Yi, and was buried in the Kang Mausoleum. He died without leaving an heir.

==Succession==
Jiang Bin&#x27;s plan was to take control of the imperial city and place the emperor&#x27;s distant relative, Zhu Junzhang, a prince from Datong, on the throne. In order to do so, he needed to be present with the emperor at the time of his death, in order to claim that he was acting on the emperor&#x27;s orders. His first step was to forge a decree on 15 April, which would give him authority over the border troops stationed in Beijing. However, his plan failed because he was not by the Zhengde Emperor&#x27;s side when he died. Instead, two eunuchs recorded the emperor&#x27;s supposed last words, which stated that his mother, Empress Dowager Zhang, and Grand Secretaries would rule the empire.
Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe took the initiative and had a plan of his own: to put the emperor&#x27;s closest cousin, thirteen-year-old Zhu Houcong, on the throne. This cousin was the son of the recently (in 1519) deceased Zhu Youyuan, Prince of Xing. By noon on 20 April, Yang Tinghe had received approval from Lady Zhang and the matter was settled. However, the Minister of Personnel, Wang Qiong (1459–1532), insisted on convening a general assembly to discuss the new emperor.

Jiang Bin was a powerful figure with his own army, making him a potential threat. On 22 April, he returned to the Forbidden City where he was informed by Yang Tinghe about a decree to return border troops from Beijing to the border. This meant that Jiang Bin&#x27;s main support was taken away from him. Despite being urged by his allies to take action, he hesitated and was eventually arrested on 24 April. Yang Tinghe obtained permission for his arrest from the eunuch-heads of the Directorate of Ceremonial, Wei Bin and Zhang Rui (), in exchange for the other eunuchs being granted immunity. Only Jiang Bin&#x27;s allies among the officers were arrested with him. With Jiang Bin out of the way, Yang Tinghe was able to secure the succession and rule the empire virtually indefinitely. He dismissed the eunuch inspectors from the border garrisons, sent the border troops in Beijing back to the border, and sent foreign envoys, monks from the Leopard Quarter, artisans, entertainers, and women who had been assembled by the emperor in Beijing back to their respective homes. All of this was done under the guise of carrying out the emperor&#x27;s will, even though the emperor&#x27;s will did not actually exist. Most of the Zhengde Emperor&#x27;s favorites were recalled and faced punishment, demotion, or exile. Jiang Bin&#x27;s wealth was also confiscated, including 70 chests of gold and 2,200 chests of silver.

==Economy and culture==
===Currency===

In 1503, after a hiatus of seventy years, the government resumed the production of coins. They attempted to bolster their value by issuing a decree that reduced the worth of coins from previous dynasties by half, and by reiterating the prohibition on the use of privately minted coins. However, by 1507, it became evident that the new coins were not performing well, and the government was forced to accept the old coins at their full value. Private minting continued to thrive, with profits exceeding expenses by five times. The state eventually shut down the mints again in 1509.

During the last decades of the 15th century, private coins were the dominant currency, and Hongwu&#x27;s coins from the early years of the dynasty were no longer in circulation. Officials referred to Tang and Song coins as &quot;old coins&quot; (&quot;guqian&quot;, &quot;jiuqian&quot;), while merchants in the market referred to them as &quot;good coins&quot; (&quot;haoqian&quot;). The &quot;new coins&quot; of the first decade of the 16th century were known as &quot;bogus coins&quot; (&quot;daohao&quot;) and were only valued at half their face value by merchants. In the Zhengte era, their value decreased even further to only a third or a quarter of their face value.

After 1510, merchants generally preferred old coins. Ming coins were only accepted at half their face value, while private light coins were only worth a quarter of their face value. However, it was the latter that dominated the market. In the early 1520s in Jiangnan, good coins that had previously been in circulation alongside new ones disappeared, leaving only the new, light coins. By 1527, the value of these coins had dropped to one-fifth or even one-tenth of their nominal value.

===Relations with Southeast Asia and the arrival of the Portuguese===
During the Hongzhi and Zhengde eras, the government showed little interest in Southeast Asia, in stark contrast to the first third of the 15th century when it actively enforced &quot;Pax Ming&quot; in the region. Even when the Portuguese showed aggression towards Malacca and the Sultan there requested help, the Beijing politicians remained lethargic. However, foreign trade with Southeast Asia continued to thrive. In 1510, local authorities recognized the separation of maritime trade and tribute relations and began taxing merchant ships arriving from abroad. By 1517, the import tax was set at 20% of the value of the ship&#x27;s cargo. This de facto legalization of foreign trade led to its expansion, benefiting buyers and increasing government revenues. However, the uncontrolled mobility of traders, often armed, caused concern among some officials who called for restrictions on trade and the establishment of order. After the death of the Zhengde Emperor and the rise of the new government of the Jiajing Empeoror, their views gained the upper hand, resulting in an anti-trade ordinance in 1524.

In 1513, the first Portuguese explorer, Jorge Álvares, arrived in China. Three years later, in 1516, Portuguese captain Rafael Perestrello arrived in Guangzhou with his ship, which had a Malayan crew. This marked the beginning of trade between China and Europe. The following year, Fernão Pires de Andrade&#x27;s squadron sailed from Malacca to China with the intention of establishing official trade and diplomatic relations. The envoy, Tomé Pires, carried a letter from King Manuel I of Portugal to the Chinese emperor and stayed in Guangzhou until the beginning of 1520, when he was finally able to travel to the imperial court. However, despite the assistance of Jiang Bin, he was unable to secure an audience with the Zhengde Emperor in the summer of 1520 in Nanjing, where the emperor was staying at the time, or later in Beijing. After the Zhengde Emperor&#x27;s death in April 1521, the new government refused to accept him and sent him back to Guangzhou.

Meanwhile, Fernão&#x27;s brother, Simão de Andrade, incited the anger of the Chinese with his aggressive actions and the purchase of children, including those who were kidnapped from wealthy families. Rumors began to circulate in Guangzhou that the Portuguese were cannibals who consumed children (although in reality, they were selling them into slavery, and some were later discovered in Diu, India). The Portuguese&#x27;s defiance of Ming authorities led to armed conflicts, and in 1521, a Ming fleet defeated them at the Battle of Tunmen. As a result, the Portuguese were expelled from China. Upon returning to the south, Tomé Pires was held responsible by the local authorities for the violent behavior of his comrades and was imprisoned. He ultimately died in prison in 1524. 

In addition to new crops, syphilis also spread from America to China. It first appeared in Guangzhou in 1505, even before the arrival of the Portuguese.

===Culture===

The Zhengde Emperor was known for his love of songwriting and singing, as well as his appreciation for court music. He also placed a strong emphasis on funding the arts. During his reign, the production of high-quality porcelain, including blue and white, polychrome, monochrome, and enameled varieties, flourished for export. These pieces often featured inscriptions in Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic. In addition, a new type of pottery called Yixing pottery was developed in the region west of Lake Tai, which was referred to as &quot;boccaro&quot; by the Portuguese.

During the Zhengde Emperor&#x27;s reign, there was also a significant development in Neo-Confucian philosophy, thanks to the work of Wang Yangming, who is considered the most important thinker of the Ming era. Unlike Zhu Xi, who focused on the concept of &quot;li&quot; (principle), Wang Yangming centered his philosophy around the idea of &quot;xin&quot; (heart/mind). He also developed a theory of the unity of cognition and action.

During the reign of the Zhengde Emperor&#x27;s grandfather, the Chenghua Emperor, publishers began to release collections of songs in colloquial language. However, it was during the Zhengde Emperor&#x27;s own reign that the number of published collections saw a significant increase. This could be attributed to his popularity as a singer and the growing popularity of theater during that time. One of the most influential figures in literature during this period was Li Dongyang, a Grand Secretary who wrote poems in the secretariat style and emphasized the importance of scholars with broad knowledge (taking Song&#x27;s Ouyang Xiu as his role model). He also played a crucial role in educating and inspiring a new generation of writers and poets. In Jiangnan, the hub of artistic activity, the most prominent calligraphers, painters, and poets included Wen Zhengming (1470–1559). Wen was a master of poetry, calligraphy, and painting, and was known for his monochrome or lightly colored landscapes in the style of Shen Zhou, as well as his &quot;green-blue landscapes&quot; in the Tang style. He was particularly skilled in regular and seal script as a calligrapher. Another highly admired artist of the time was Zhu Yunming, who was known for his &quot;crazy cursive script&quot;. Tang Yin was also recognized for his semi-cursive script, landscapes, and figure painting.

==Legacy==
Classical historians were highly critical of Liu&#x27;s group, despite their efforts to improve administration efficiency, halt the decline of central authority, and prevent officials from prioritizing personal interests. These reforms, which predated similar efforts by Zhang Juzheng, were met with rejection by the conservative faction of the bureaucracy due to their initiation by eunuchs. This gave the critics another reason to condemn Liu&#x27;s clique.

The call-up of front-line units to Beijing, even for a short period, disrupted the traditional organization of the army, hindered unit training, and resulted in insubordination in some units. In particular, detachments from Datong rebelled multiple times.

Due to his refusal to fulfill his government duties, the true power shifted to the eunuch Liu Jin, who was well-versed in the traditional ways of governing. However, as time went on, the emperor&#x27;s favorites among the officers gained more influence, leading to chaos that the Grand Secretaries and ministers struggled to rectify. Eventually, the executive power shifted from the emperor (who was aided by eunuchs) to the Grand Secretariat, particularly its leader. In 1521, Yang Tinghe was able to assume almost imperial powers, in contrast to his predecessor, the humble Li Dongyang, who was the last of the old-style Grand Secretaries. As imperial power weakened, the social status of educated officials in their communities rose. With the added benefit of tax exemption, they expanded their land holdings, placing the burden of taxes on the common people. Despite efforts to halt this trend, it persisted until the end of the dynasty.

After the Zhengde Emperor&#x27;s death, his private life had significant consequences, as a dispute arose over the status of the new emperor&#x27;s parents.

The negative portrayal of the Zhengde Emperor by Chinese classical historians, which began as early as the 16th century, has also been adopted in the West. For example, the &quot;Dictionary of Ming Biography, 1368–1644&quot; (pp. 307–315, 1976) includes a sharply negative entry on the emperor. The most comprehensive Western work on the Zhengde Emperor, as of 2001, was the chapter &quot;The Cheng-te reign, 1506–1521&quot; (pp. 403–439) in &quot;The Cambridge History of China: Volume 7, The Ming Dynasty, 1368–1644, Part 1&quot; (1988) by James Geiss.

<doc id="390591" wikidata="Q10011" url="?curid=390591" title="Jiajing Emperor">
<text>The Jiajing Emperor (16September 150723January 1567), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Shizong of Ming, personal name Zhu Houcong, art names Yaozhai, Leixuan, and Tianchi Diaosou, was the 12th emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1521 to 1567. He succeeded his cousin, the Zhengde Emperor.

The Jiajing Emperor was born as a cousin of the reigning Zhengde Emperor, so his accession to the throne was unexpected. However, when the Zhengde Emperor died without an heir, the government, led by Senior Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe and the Empress Dowager Zhang, chose him as the new ruler. However, after his enthronement, a dispute arose between the emperor and most of the officials regarding the method of legalizing his accession. The Great Rites Controversy was a major political problem at the beginning of his reign. After three years, the emperor emerged victorious, with his main opponents either banished from court or executed.

The Jiajing Emperor, like the Zhengde Emperor, made the decision to reside outside of Beijing&#x27;s Forbidden City. In 1542, he relocated to the West Park, located in the middle of Beijing and west of the Forbidden City. He constructed a complex of palaces and Taoist temples in the West Park, drawing inspiration from the Taoist belief of the Land of Immortals. Within the West Park, he surrounded himself with a group of loyal eunuchs, Taoist monks, and trusted advisers (including Grand Secretaries and Ministers of Rites) who assisted him in managing the state bureaucracy. The Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s team of advisers and Grand Secretaries were led by Zhang Fujing (), Xia Yan, Yan Song, and Xu Jie in succession.

At the start of the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s reign, the borders were relatively peaceful. In the north, the Mongols were initially embroiled in internal conflicts. However, after being united by Altan Khan in the 1540s, they began to demand the restoration of free trade. The emperor, however, refused and attempted to close the borders with fortifications, including the Great Wall of China. In response, Altan Khan launched raids and even attacked the outskirts of Beijing in 1550. The Ming troops were forced to focus on defense. The conflict only came to an end after Jiajing&#x27;s death, when the new Ming emperor Longqing allowed trade to resume.

In the Jiajing era, &quot;Wokou&quot; pirates posed a significant threat to the southeastern provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong for several decades. The Ming authorities attempted to address this issue by implementing stricter laws against private overseas trade in the 1520s. However, piracy and related violence continued to escalate throughout the 1540s and reached its peak in the 1550s. It was not until the 1560s, particularly after 1567 when the Longqing Emperor relaxed laws against maritime trade with foreign countries, that the problem began to be gradually suppressed.

In 1556, northern China was struck by a devastating natural disaster—the deadliest earthquake in human history, with its epicenter in Shaanxi. The earthquake claimed the lives of over 800,000 people. Despite the destruction caused by the disaster, the economy continued to develop, with growth in agriculture, industry, and trade. As the economy flourished, so did society, with the traditional Confucian interpretation of Zhuism giving way to Wang Yangming&#x27;s more individualistic beliefs.

However, in his later years, the emperor&#x27;s pursuit of immortality led to questionable actions, such as his interest in young girls and alchemy. He even sent Taoist priests across the land to collect rare minerals for life-extending potions. These elixirs contained harmful substances like arsenic, lead, and mercury, which ultimately caused health problems and may have shortened the emperor&#x27;s life.

==Childhood==

Zhu Houcong, the future Jiajing Emperor, was born on 16 September 1507. He was the eldest son of Zhu Youyuan, who was Prince of Xing from 1487. Zhu Youyuan was the fourth son of the Chenghua Emperor, who ruled the Ming dynasty from 1464 to 1487. His mother, Lady Shao, was one of the emperor&#x27;s concubines. Zhu Houcong&#x27;s mother, surnamed Jiang, was the daughter of Jiang Xiao of Daxing in North Zhili. Jiang Xiao was an officer of the Beijing garrison. Zhu Houcong&#x27;s parents from 1494 lived in Anlu zhou (present-day Zhongxiang) in Huguang in central China, where Zhu Houcong was born. His father, Zhu Youyuan, was known for his poetry and calligraphy.

Zhu Houcong received a classical (Confucian) education directly from his father, who he was a diligent and attentive student to. However, in July 1519, his father died. After this, Zhu Houcong took on the responsibility of managing the household with the assistance of Yuan Zonggao, a capable administrator who later became a trusted advisor after Zhu Houcong&#x27;s ascension to the throne in Beijing. Following the traditional period of mourning for his father&#x27;s death, Zhu Houcong officially became the Prince of Xing in late March 1521.

==Beginning of reign==
===Accession===
Meanwhile, in Beijing, the Zhengde Emperor (ruled 1505–1521) fell ill and died on 20 April 1521. The Zhengde Emperor was the son of the Hongzhi Emperor (ruled 1487–1505), who was the older brother of Zhu Youyuan. Zhu Houcong was Zhengde&#x27;s cousin and closest male relative.

Before the death of the Zhengde Emperor, Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe, who was effectively leading the Ming government, had already begun preparations for the accession of Zhu Houcong. Five days prior to the Zhengde Emperor&#x27;s death, an edict was issued ordering Zhu Houcong to end his mourning and officially assume the title of Prince of Xing. On the day of the emperor&#x27;s death, Yang Tinghe, with the support of eunuchs from the Directorate of Ceremonial in the Forbidden City and Empress Dowager Zhang (the late emperor&#x27;s mother), issued an edict calling for the prince to arrive in Beijing and ascend the throne.

However, there was uncertainty surrounding this matter due to the Ming succession law. According to this law, although Ming emperors were allowed to have multiple wives, only the sons of the first wife, the empress, had the right to succeed the throne. Any attempt to install a descendant of a secondary wife was punishable by death. Zhu Houcong&#x27;s father, Zhu Youyuan, was not the son of the empress, but rather of a secondary wife, therefore he had no legitimate claim to the throne. In order to circumvent this issue, Yang Tinghe proposed adopting Zhu Houcong as the Hongzhi Emperor&#x27;s son, so he could ascend as the late emperor&#x27;s younger brother.

In addition, there were many favorites of the deceased emperor living in Beijing who were afraid of changes. The most influential among them was General Jiang Bin, the commander of the border troops who had been transferred to Beijing. It was feared that he would try to install his own candidate for the throne, namely Zhu Junzhang (), Prince of Dai, who was based in the border city of Datong.
The day after the Zhengde Emperor&#x27;s death, a delegation of high-ranking dignitaries left Beijing for Anlu to inform the prince of the situation. They arrived in Anlu on 2 May. Zhu Houcong accepted them, familiarized himself with the edict of the empress dowager, and agreed to ascend the throne. On 7 May, he set out for Beijing accompanied by forty of his own advisers and servants. Yang Tinghe issued orders for him to be welcomed in Beijing as the heir to the throne, but Zhu Houcong refused to appear as the heir apparent, stating that he was invited to assume the imperial rank and was therefore the emperor, not the son of the emperor. According to the Grand Secretaries and the government, he was the son of the Hongzhi Emperor. He forced his way into the city with imperial honors and on the same day, 27 May 1521, he ceremoniously ascended the throne. The young emperor reportedly chose the name of his era himself, from his favorite chapter of the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, with &quot;jia&quot; meaning &quot;to improve, make splendid&quot; and &quot;jing&quot; meaning &quot;to pacify&quot; in Chinese.

===Great Rites Controversy===
The primary desire of the new emperor was to posthumously elevate his father to the imperial rank. In contrast, Yang Tinghe insisted on his formal adoption by the Hongzhi Emperor, in order to legitimize his claim to the throne and become the younger brother of the late Zhengde Emperor. However, the Jiajing Emperor and his mother rejected the adoption, citing the wording of the recall decree which did not mention it. The emperor did not want to declare his parents as his uncle and aunt. Instead, he requested the elevation of his parents to the imperial status &quot;to bring their ranks into line&quot;.

Most officials agreed to maintain a direct line of succession and supported Yang Tinghe, but the emperor argued for the duty to his biological parents. He insisted on his mother&#x27;s acceptance as Empress dowager when she arrived from Anlu and entered the Forbidden City on 2 November. A group of officials, led by Zhang Fujing () and standing on the side of the emperor, had already formed. In late 1521, the Jiajing Emperor succeeded in having his parents and grandmother, Lady Shao, granted imperial rank. However, disputes continued until Yang Tinghe was forced to resign in March 1524, and the removal of the emperor&#x27;s opponents began in August 1524. After a disapproving demonstration by hundreds of opposing officials in front of the gates of the audience hall, the opposition was beaten at court. 17 officials died from their wounds, and the rest were exiled to the provinces by the emperor.

During the dispute, the Jiajing Emperor asserted his independence from the Grand Secretaries and made decisions based on his own judgment, rather than consulting with them or simply approving their proposals. This was seen as a despotic approach that went against the traditional way of governing, and was criticized by concerned scholars. As a result of the dispute, the teachings of Confucian scholar and reformer Wang Yangming gained popularity, as some of the emperor&#x27;s followers were influenced by his arguments. Additionally, there was an increase in critical analysis and interpretation of texts during discussions, and there was a growing criticism of the conservative attitudes of the Hanlin Academy.

===Honoring parents and legitimizing the government===

In 1530, the Jiajing Emperor published the biography of Empress Ma, the &quot;Gao huanghou chuan&quot; (), and the &quot;Household Instructions&quot; of Empress Xu under the title &quot;Nüxun&quot; (; &#x27;Instructions for women&#x27;, in 12 volumes). The work was attributed to the emperor&#x27;s mother. Empress Ma was the wife of the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the dynasty, and Empress Xu was the wife of the Yongle Emperor, the first monarch in the new branch of the dynasty. Additionally, the emperor changed the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s temple name from &quot;Taizong&quot; to &quot;Chengzu&quot;. The Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s interest in the Yongle Emperor was rooted in his desire to establish a new branch of the dynasty.

The emperor also suggested transferring his father&#x27;s remains from the mausoleum in Huguang to the vicinity of the imperial burial ground near Beijing. However, in the end, only a shrine was created for him in the palace. The emperor also took steps to honor his ancestors, such as restoring ancestral temples, giving his parents longer titles, and supervising rituals and ritual music. After his mother&#x27;s death in December 1538, the emperor traveled south to Anlu to resolve the question of whether to bury his parents together in the south or in Beijing. He ultimately chose to bury his mother in his father&#x27;s mausoleum near Zhongxiang. In honor of his father, he also published his &quot;Veritable Records&quot; (&quot;Shilu&quot;) and renamed Anlu zhou to Chengtian Prefecture (, &quot;Chengtian Fu&quot;) after the example of the imperial capitals.

During his journey to Anlu, the Jiajing Emperor was shocked by the sight of starving and impoverished people and refugees. He immediately released 20 thousand &quot;liang&quot; (746 kg) of silver for relief. He saw their suffering as a failure of his ceremonial and administrative reforms. Two years later, during civil service examinations, he asked candidates why there was still poverty in the country despite his efforts to faithfully follow Confucian teachings and observe ceremonies.

===Further ceremony reforms===

After successfully resolving the Great Rites Controversy, the emperor proceeded to make changes to other rituals and ceremonies, despite facing opposition from some officials. These changes primarily affected the rites performed by the monarch. In the late 1530s, separate sacrifices to the Heavens, Earth, Sun, and Moon were introduced. 

Additionally, the Jiajing Emperor altered the titles and forms of honoring Confucius, including a ban on images in Confucius temples, leaving only plaques with the names of Confucius and his followers. The layout of the Temple of Confucius was also modified to include separate chapels for Confucius&#x27; father and three disciples. As part of these changes, Confucius was stripped of his title of king by the Jiajing Emperor, who believed that the emperor should not bow to a king. Furthermore, the emperor did not want Confucius to be worshipped in the same rituals used for imperial sacrifices to the Heavens. As a result, the ceremonies in the Temple of Confucius were simplified and no longer resembled imperial sacrifices.

In addition, sacrifices to former emperors and kings were separated from the imperial sacrifices to the Heavens, and a special temple was built for them. This elevated the status of the monarch, as his rites were now distinct from all others. However, from the years 1532–1533, the Jiajing Emperor lost interest in ritual reforms and the worship of Heaven, as he was no longer able to elevate his own or his father&#x27;s status. This led to a decline in the importance of ceremonies during his reign.

==Government==
===Eunuchs===
Important positions in the imperial palace were filled by eunuchs brought from Anlu by the Jiajing Emperor. As part of the dismissal of eunuchs associated with the previous monarch, some eunuch posts in the provinces were eliminated. However, the overall influence of eunuchs did not decrease; in fact, it continued to grow. By the 1530s, the most influential eunuchs saw themselves as equal to the Grand Secretaries. In 1548–1549, the roles of the head of the Eastern Depot and the Directorate of Ceremonial were combined, and the palace guard (established in 1552 and composed of eunuchs) was also under their control. This effectively placed the entire eunuch branch of state administration under their management.

===Grand Secretaries===

After 1524, the emperor&#x27;s closest advisers were Zhang Fujing and Gui E (). They attempted to remove followers of Yang Tinghe, who were associated with the Hanlin Academy, from influential positions. This resulted in a purge of the Beijing authorities in 1527–1528 and a significant change in personnel at the academy. In addition, Zhang Fujing and Gui E worked to limit the influence of Senior Grand Secretary, Fei Hong (), in the Grand Secretariat. To balance this, they brought back Yang Yiqing, who had previously served in the Grand Secretariat in 1515–1516. In the following years, there was a power struggle between the Grand Secretaries and their associated groups of officials. The position of Senior Grand Secretary was constantly changing, with Fei Hong, Yang Yiqing, Zhang Fujing, and others taking turns.

In the early 1530s, the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s trust was won by Xia Yan, who had been promoted from Minister of Rites to Grand Secretary. Later, in the late 1530s, Yan Song, Xia Yan&#x27;s successor in the ministry, also gained the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s trust. However, despite initially supporting Yan Song&#x27;s rise, Xia Yan and Yan Song eventually came into conflict. In 1542, Yan Song was able to oust Xia Yan and take control of the Grand Secretariat. In an attempt to counterbalance Yan Song&#x27;s influence, the emperor called Xia Yan back to lead the Grand Secretariat in October 1545. However, the two statesmen were at odds, with Xia Yan ignoring Yan Song, refusing to consult him, and canceling his appointment. As a result, the emperor grew distant from Xia Yan, partly due to his reserved attitude towards Taoist rituals and prayers. In contrast, Yan Song strongly supported the emperor&#x27;s interest in Taoism. In February 1548, Xia Yan supported a campaign to Ordos without informing Yan Song, making him solely responsible for it. When the emperor withdrew his support for the campaign due to unfavorable omens and reports of discontent in the neighboring province of Shaanxi, enemies of Xia Yan, including Yan Song, used this as an opportunity to bring charges against him and have him executed.

From 1549 to 1562, the Grand Secretariat was under the control of Yan Song. He was known for his attentiveness and diligence towards the monarch, but also for pushing his colleagues out of power. Despite facing numerous political crises and challenges, Yan Song managed to survive by delegating decisions and responsibilities to the appropriate ministries and authorities. For example, the Ministry of Rites was responsible for dealing with the Mongols, while the Ministry of War handled their expulsion. However, Yan Song avoided getting involved in the government&#x27;s biggest issue at the time—state finances—leaving it to the Ministries of Revenue and Works. He only maintained control over personnel matters and selected political issues. Despite facing criticism for corruption and selling offices, Yan Song was able to convince the emperor that these were false accusations and that his critics were simply trying to remove him from power. The emperor, who was always suspicious of officials, believed Yan Song&#x27;s defense.

Yan Song, who was already eighty years old in 1560, was unable to continue his role as Grand Secretary. This was especially true after his wife died in 1561 and his son, who had been assisting him with writing edicts, went home to organize the funeral. To make matters worse, he faced opposition from his subordinate, Grand Secretary Xu Jie. As a result, the emperor no longer relied on Yan Song and dismissed him in June 1562. Xu Jie then took over as the head of the Grand Secretariat.

With the personnel changes in the immediate surroundings of the emperor, the focus and style of his policies also shifted. During the first phase of his reign, the Jiajing Emperor placed great importance on ceremonies, which were seen as essential in maintaining order and promoting a sense of superiority over non-Chinese peoples, according to Confucian beliefs. The refinement and organization of these ceremonies aimed to showcase the Ming dynasty as a model for surrounding countries and the world. The emperor received significant assistance from his Senior Grand Secretary, Zhang Fujing. However, during Xia Yan&#x27;s dominance in the Grand Secretariat, the emperor withdrew from the Forbidden City to the West Park, neglecting his public duties but still maintaining control over the government. During this time, Ming China used military force to intimidate neighboring countries, successfully in the case of Đại Việt, but falling in the attempt to recapture Ordos, resulting in Xia Yan&#x27;s death in 1548. In the following period, during the conflicts of the 1550s in the north and on the coast, Yan Song pursued a policy of compromise and negotiation, which was accompanied by corruption. After the fall of Yan Song in 1562, the emperor&#x27;s interest in good governance was rekindled under the influence of the capable and energetic Grand Secretary, Xu Jie. Thus, the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s rule after the overthrow of Yang Tinghe can be divided into four phases: Zhang Fujing&#x27;s strict adherence to ideology, Xia Yan&#x27;s aggressive expansionism, Yan Song&#x27;s complacent corruption, and Xu Jie&#x27;s corrective reforms.

===Organization of the government===
One important aspect of the decision-making process since the beginning of the Ming dynasty has been the system of interdepartmental consultation among high officials. Memoranda and proposals were submitted for debate to the &quot;nine ministers&quot;, as well as to generals of the Central Military Commissions and other officials. The result of these discussions was then presented to the emperor for a final decision. The Grand Secretaries were responsible for organizing the circulation of these memoranda but did not have the authority to make decisions. The Jiajing Emperor emphasized the importance of discussing important decisions at court and encouraged officials to express their opinions, particularly in the case of high-ranking government officials, to the obligee. 

However, in the early Ming period, this system often served to justify the decisions of the emperors (especially after the crisis of 1380), as there was no social basis for diverse attitudes. However, as the crises of the mid-15th century emerged, the situation changed, and the need for political changes became apparent. The emergence of officials with merchant-family backgrounds also provided a basis for assessing problems from different perspectives. Officials used this system to debate, build support networks, lobby for their own interests, push opponents out of office, and sometimes even sabotage their policies.

===Assassination attempts and relocation to the West Park===
The emperor&#x27;s harsh treatment of dissenters earned him many opponents and led to multiple attempts on his life. In 1539, while traveling to Anlu, his temporary residences were repeatedly set on fire. The most serious incident occurred on 27 November 1542, when a group of palace women attempted to strangle him. When the emperor had fallen asleep in one of his concubines&#x27; quarters, a serving girl led several palace women to start strangling him with a silk cord. However, one of the palace women panicked and alerted the eunuchs, who then informed Empress Fang. The emperor eventually woke up after being unconscious for eight hours but was unable to speak. Empress Fang ordered the execution of all women involved in the assassination attempt, both those who were actually involved and those who were falsely accused. The motives of palace women are unclear, but possibly the emperor&#x27;s cruel treatment towards them, driven by his pursuit of a longer life, may have played a role.

After the assassination attempt, the Jiajing Emperor completely withdrew from the formal life of the court and the Forbidden City. He moved to the Yongshou Palace (Palace of Eternal Life) in the West Park of the Imperial City, where he occasionally stayed starting in 1539.

The West Park was located in the western third of the Imperial City, separated from it and the Forbidden City by a system of three lakes called Taiye Lake. These lakes stretched over two kilometers from north to south and occupied half of the park&#x27;s area. The emperor built West Park to be a complex where he could live and seek immortality. Since the beginning of the Ming dynasty, West Park has been seen as a symbol of the Lands of Immortals. The Jiajing Emperor, who was fascinated by Taoism and the concept of immortality, was intrigued by this and attempted to reconstruct the site in accordance with contemporary beliefs about the Lands of Immortals. He aligned the names of the palaces and the attire of the servants and officials with Taoist symbolism, and Taoist ceremonies were performed. Animals were also kept, and plants were grown for divination purposes. However, after the emperor&#x27;s death, most of the buildings he had constructed were demolished, leaving only one temple, Dagaoxian dian, which still stands today.

After 1542, the emperor never resided in his palace in the Forbidden City. This relocation to the West Park also resulted in the transfer of the administrative center of the empire, further isolating the emperor from the bureaucracy. In fact, as early as 1534, he ceased holding imperial audiences. Instead, his decisions were conveyed to the ministries and other authorities through a select group of advisors who had direct access to him. This group included the Grand Secretaries, the Minister of Rites, and several military commanders. However, the discontinuation of audiences did not indicate a lack of interest in governing; the emperor diligently read reports and submissions from officials and often worked late into the night.

===Taoist pursuits===
From the beginning of his reign, the Jiajing Emperor was drawn to the Taoist faith, with its focus on supernaturalism and the pursuit of immortality. This may have been influenced by his childhood spent in Huguang, where the people were known for their superstitious beliefs. However, the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s support of Taoism was not without limits. In 1527, ministers and Grand Secretaries Gui E, Fang Xianfu (), Yang Yiqing, and Huo Tao () proposed stricter regulations for the establishment of new Taoist and Buddhist temples and monasteries. They also suggested the abolition of nunneries and temples, the confiscation of their property, and the return of Buddhist and Taoist nuns and priests to secular life. The emperor signed the decree that was prepared. However, as the Jiajing Emperor had no heir in the first ten years of his reign, some high-ranking officials suggested that Taoist prayers and rituals could solve the problem. This piqued his interest, which only intensified after the assassination in 1542.

The Jiajing Emperor spared no expense or time for Taoist ceremonies. The Taoists requested, among other things, tens of kilograms of gold dust for their prayers. The emperor even had temples built for them, which required a lot of wood to be transported from distant Sichuan. Additionally, he gave them valuable items. Among the Taoists, Shao Yuanjie ()was particularly favored by the emperor starting in 1526. Shao Yuanjie was known for his prayers for rain and protection against calamities. After the birth of the emperor&#x27;s first sons (the eldest died young in 1533, and the second was born in 1536), he was highly honored. However, Shao Yuanjie died in 1539 and was replaced by Tao Zhongwen (). Tao Zhongwen further strengthened the emperor&#x27;s faith in Taoism and gained respect for himself by accurately predicting a fire on the way south to Anlu. In order to prolong the emperor&#x27;s life, Tao Zhongwen offered him aphrodisiacs and elixirs of immortality made from surite and arsenic. In September 1540, the emperor announced his plans to withdraw into private life in the coming years to seek immortality. This caused great concern among officials, who criticized the preparations as toxic. Those who openly criticized the emperor were executed, and in the following decades, he slowly consumed the elixirs.

After 1545, the emperor began to rely on oracles for guidance in state affairs. These oracles were organized by Tao Zhongwen, who had control over their results. Yan Song also participated in divination, seeing it as an opportunity to influence politics in a favorable direction. The emperor&#x27;s pursuit of immortality included engaging in sexual relations with young girls, of which he and Tao Zhongwen collected 960 for this purpose. He also called on officials throughout the country to search for and send magical herbs. However, after Tao Zhongwen&#x27;s death in November 1560, the emperor struggled to find a Taoist adept who could meet his needs.

In addition to Taoist prayers, the literary form of &quot;qingci&quot; (), a poetic style of prayer full of allusions, was revived and developed. The emperor&#x27;s favor with officials was often based on their skill in writing in this style, rather than their statesmanship. Yan Song and Xia Yan, who were particularly skilled in this style, were often referred to contemptuously as &quot;qingci zaixiang&quot; (; &#x27;Qingci premiers&#x27;).

==Economy==
===Natural disasters and the economy===

During the reign of the Jiajing Emperor, the climate was cooler and wetter compared to previous years. However, towards the end of his reign, there were warmer winters. Temperatures were 1.5 degrees lower than in the second half of the 20th century. The south and north of China were affected by floods, while the Yangtze River basin experienced severe drought. In 1528, the worst drought of the entire Ming era hit Zhejiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hubei, resulting in the death of half of the population in some areas of Henan and Jiangnan. Jiangnan continued to suffer from droughts, epidemics, rains, and famines until the late 1540s.

Earthquakes were also a frequent occurrence during the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s reign, with many recorded in various areas. For instance, in the span of ten months from July 1523 to May 1524, there were 38 recorded earthquakes. In Nanjing alone, there were fifteen in just one month in 1525. The most devastating earthquake occurred on 23 January 1556, affecting the provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan. In Shaanxi, entire regions such as Weinan, Huazhou, Chaoyi, and Sanyuan were left in ruins. The Yellow River and the Wei River also overflowed, and some areas experienced tremors for several days. The disaster claimed the lives of 830,000 people, including several former ministers. As a result, the affected areas were granted tax forgiveness for several years.

Despite facing occasional challenges from nature, the first half of the 16th century saw significant economic growth in agriculture and crafts. However, the state struggled to collect taxes, particularly from newly cultivated land, trade, and handicraft production. The quotas and revenues set a century earlier were not met.

===New crops from America===
During the Jiajing era, Chinese peasants began to expand their agricultural crops to include species native to Central and South America. In the 1530s, groundnut cultivation was documented in Jiangnan, having spread there from Fujian. Fujian peasants acquired this crop from Portuguese sailors. Sweet potatoes were documented in Yunnan at the beginning of the 1560s, having arrived via Burma. Their presence on the southeast coast (Fujian and Guangdong) was only mentioned by authors of the time in the last decades of the 16th century, during the Wanli era. Maize cultivation was documented as early as the 1550s in inland Henan, but it was most likely acquired from Europeans several decades earlier. It was also sent by Yunnan natives to Beijing as part of tribute before the mid-16th century. However, maize was not well-liked by the Chinese and its cultivation remained the concern of minority peoples in southwest China for nearly three centuries. It was only in the 18th century that it began to be grown on a larger scale in Chinese-populated regions.

===State finances at the beginning of the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s reign===
Yang Tinghe, upon the accession of the Jiajing Emperor, implemented a program of severe austerity. This was in response to the significant increase in the number of state-paid dignitaries during the previous century. The number of officers rose from less than 13,000 at the beginning of the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s reign (1368–1398) to 28,000 by the end, and eventually reached 100,000 in 1520; many of them lived in and around the capital. Many of these officers were surplus and did not actively serve in the military. The same was true for civil servants, resulting in a total of around 4 million &quot;shi&quot; of grain being imported to Beijing each year to support the needs of civil servants, soldiers, and officers. This grain was distributed at a rate of 1 &quot;shi&quot; (107.4 liters) per person per month, providing for approximately 300,000 individuals. In 1522, Yang Tinghe took decisive action by cutting off payments to 148,700 supernumerary and honorary officers and officials, resulting in an annual reduction of 1.5 million &quot;shi&quot; of grain in state expenditure. This move proved to be beneficial in the mid-16th century, as the savings allowed the authorities to convert the 1.5 million &quot;shi&quot; of grain tax into a silver tax, greatly improving the state&#x27;s finances.

===State finances in the 1540s–1560s===

In the mid-1520s, despite efforts to save money, the state&#x27;s financial situation remained problematic. The costly construction projects during the early years of the Jiajing era had depleted the grain supplies from 8–9 years&#x27; worth of expenditure to only 3 years, as well as the silver reserves that had been accumulated in the 1520s. In 1540, the Minister of Revenue was dismissed for refusing to agree to an increase in the number of workers on public works, which already numbered 40,000. He argued that the cost of reconstructing palaces, ceremonial altars, and temples had already reached 6 million &quot;liang&quot; (224 tons) of silver since the beginning of the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s reign, and that he did not have the means to sustain such a pace of construction. While the emperor did cancel some projects, the most expensive buildings in the West Park were not among them.

The revenue of the Taicang treasury, which consisted of the Ministry of Revenue&#x27;s income in silver, averaged 2 million &quot;liang&quot; (74.6 tons) per year after 1532. Out of this amount, 1.3 million &quot;liang&quot; was allocated for border defense. However, in the 1540s, the annual silver expenditure increased to 3.47 million &quot;liang&quot;, resulting in a deficit of 1.4 million. The Ministry of Revenue attempted to address this issue by implementing stricter monitoring of income and expenses, as well as requiring final accounts to be presented at the end of each year. Despite these efforts, the deficits persisted. In 1541, 1.2 million &quot;shi&quot; of grain surplus, which was a result of Yang Tinghe&#x27;s austerity measures, were converted into silver payments. However, this decision was later revoked after five years, but was eventually reinstated. This led to an increase in the annual revenue of the Taicang treasury from 2 to more than 3 million &quot;liang&quot; in the early 1550s. From 1540 onwards, the conversion of taxes from grain to silver became widespread, although the specific proportion and method of conversion varied among different counties.

In the 1550s, state expenditures, both regular and extraordinary, increased significantly. The cost of maintaining military garrisons on the northern border doubled, and the state faced additional financial burdens due to the earthquake of 1556 and the fire that destroyed three audience palaces and the southern gate of the Forbidden City in 1557. The reconstruction of these palaces took five years and cost hundreds of thousands of &quot;liang&quot; of silver. In 1561, the emperor&#x27;s palace in the West Park, which had also been recently rebuilt, burned down again. During this time, the state&#x27;s annual expenditure in silver ranged from 3 to 6 million &quot;liang&quot;, while the proper revenue was only around 3 million. To make up for the shortfall, the state resorted to extraordinary taxes, savings, and even transfers from the emperor&#x27;s personal treasury, which often left it completely depleted. In 1552, the Minister of Revenue proposed an additional tax of two million &quot;liang&quot; to be imposed on the wealthy prefectures of Jiangnan. The emperor agreed and this procedure was repeated. However, during the 1550s, Jiangnan was frequently attacked by pirates and also suffered from natural disasters, making it difficult to collect even the usual taxes. The local authorities were exhausted and lacked the resources to deal with floods and crop failures, and the government did not respond until the situation became dire and refugees, along with epidemics, appeared on the streets of Beijing. To fund military operations in southeastern China, taxes were levied in the affected regions, often in the form of labor surcharges. These taxes remained in place until some of them (totaling 400–500 thousand &quot;liang&quot;) were abolished in 1562.

Savings and frugality also had negative consequences. In 1560, the market price of rice doubled to 0.8 liang of silver per tan, leading to a revolt by the Nanjing garrison. To appease them, 40 thousand &quot;liang&quot; (1492 kg) of silver was distributed, and the soldiers were not punished.

Another issue was the salaries of members of the imperial family, which exceeded 8.5 million &quot;shi&quot; of grain in the early 1560s and were still insufficient for the large number of family members. This problem was brought to the attention of the emperor, who discussed it but took no action. In 1564, 140 members of the imperial family gathered in front of the governor&#x27;s palace in Shensi to demand payment of their arrears, which amounted to over 600,000 &quot;shi&quot; of grain. However, the local authorities were only able to collect 78,000 liang of silver. As a result, the emperor excluded those involved from the imperial family, but the issue persisted.

===Land tax reforms===
The government&#x27;s need for silver revenue prompted the implementation of the single whip reform, beginning in the south-east coast where there was a surplus of silver due to the flourishing trade industry. During the period of 1530s to 1570s, the primary source of silver for China was western Japan, where new deposits were found. In the 1550s and 1560s, Chinese merchants faced restricted access to Japan due to conflicts on the Chinese coast. As a result, the Portuguese took on the role of intermediary between Japan and China.

The reforms, known as the &quot;single whip reform&quot;, encompassed a variety of measures that were implemented in different locations and combinations. These measures included the replacement of taxpayers with compulsory labor for land assignments, the introduction of annual payments instead of the previous ten-year levy cycle of the lijia system, the substitution of compulsory labor tax payments, the consolidation of various fees and mandatory services into a single payment, and the simplification of land categorization. In 1522, a new method of calculating taxes was implemented (initially in one county). This method took into account the fertility of newly fertilized land and the conversion of field area to fiscal &quot;mu&quot;, making it easier for taxpayers to calculate their taxes. This method became popular in both the North and South, but the government had mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it simplified the tax calculation process, but on the other hand, it relied on lower-ranking officials who were known for their corrupt practices. As a result, the government would sometimes support and other times ban this method. The adjustments and equalization of taxes also had a positive impact on land prices and market activity. In some cases, the implementation of new local cadastres led to households acquiring land registers, replacing the outdated Yellow Registers.

===Philosophy===

During the early years of the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s reign, the statesman and philosopher Wang Yangming (d. 1529) was in the last years of his life. Although he did not participate in the rites dispute, his disciples were sympathetic towards the emperor&#x27;s &quot;following of the inner moral voice&quot;. Despite his previous success in quelling the rebellion of the Prince of Ning, Wang had been dismissed from his position in the civil service under the Zhengde Emperor. However, in 1525, the Minister of Rites, Xi Shu (), proposed his reinstatement due to his exceptional reputation as a statesman. This proposal faced opposition from Grand Secretaries Gui E and Yang Yiqing, whose influence would diminish with Wang&#x27;s return to Beijing. As a result, they suggested sending him to the southeast to suppress the rebellion in Guangxi.

Wang Yangming&#x27;s new concept of Neo-Confucian philosophy, centered on the concept of &quot;xin&quot; (heart/mind), was met with criticism from representatives of the official Zhusist orthodoxy. As a result, his teachings were banned and he was only rehabilitated in 1567, after the death of the Jiajing Emperor. However, despite this setback, his ideas continued to spread throughout the country. As his teachings gained popularity, his followers formed various regional schools. The Jiangzhou school, led by figures such as Luo Hongxian, Zuo Shouyi (), Ouyang De (), and Nie Bao (), provided the most accurate interpretation of Wang&#x27;s ideas. The Taizhou school, on the other hand, led by Wang Gen, He Xinyin (), and others, took a more radical approach.

Some Neo-Confucians disagreed with the views of either Wang Yangming or Zhu Xi on the origin of the universe. Instead, they focused on elaborating the concept of &quot;qi&quot;. For example, Wang Tingxiang () drew inspiration from the ideas of Zhang Zai of Song and Xue Xuan () of Ming. He argued that the universe did not arise from the principle of &quot;li&quot;, but from the primordial energy of &quot;qi&quot; (&quot;yuan qi&quot;). Similarly, Luo Qinshun () believed that energy was the primordial force, while principle served as the source of order and regularity. Both of these thinkers aimed to shift philosophy from moralizing to empiricism, a direction that would become prevalent in Chinese Confucianism a century later during the early Qing period.

===Painting and calligraphy===

During the Jiajing era, the epicenter of artistic creativity was in the wealthy Jiangnan region, particularly in Suzhou. This area attracted intellectuals who prioritized artistic self-expression over pursuing an official career. These intellectuals were known as the Wu School, named after the region&#x27;s old name. The most prominent and representative painters of the Wu School were Wen Zhengming and Chen Chun. Wen Zhengming was a master of poetry, calligraphy, and painting. He was known for his monochrome or lightly colored landscapes in the style of Shen Zhou, as well as his &quot;blue-green landscapes&quot; in the Tang style. He is credited with reviving the tradition of southern amateur painting. Chen Chun, a disciple of Wen Zhengming, brought originality to the genre of flowers and birds. He was also renowned for his conceptual writing as a calligrapher. Wen Zhengming had many disciples and followers, including his sons and the painters Wen Peng and Wen Jia. Wen Peng, in addition to his skills in conceptual writing, gained recognition for his seal carving. Other notable painters from the Wu School include Wen Zhengming&#x27;s relative Wen Boren, as well as Qian Gu and Lu Zhi.

Many artists, such as Qiu Ying and Xu Wei, were influenced by the Wu school but did not belong to it. They worked in Suzhou and its surrounding areas. Qiu Ying was part of the conservative wing of the Southern tradition, while Xu Wei broke away from this conservative expression. His paintings are characterized by a deliberate carelessness and simplification of form, resulting in exceptional credibility and expressiveness in his compositions. Qiu Ying&#x27;s works were more popular among the general public than the work of scholars and officials, known as literary painting. As a result, merchants often signed his paintings in his name, even if they were far from his style.

===Poetry, drama===

The direction of literary development in the previous Zhengde era and the beginning of the Jiajing era was determined by the Earlier Seven Masters, led by Li Mengyang and He Jingming (), including Wang Tingxiang (). Their main objective was to break away from the traditional cabinet-style poetry of the 15th century, which they believed lacked expression and emotion due to its adherence to conventions. Instead, they looked to Han and Qin prose, as well as Tang and older poetry, particularly from the peak Tang period, as their models. This trend continued into the 16th century with the emergence of Xie Zhen, the first of the Latter Seven Masters. Li Panlong () led the Latter Seven Masters, with Wang Shizhen () being considered the greatest poet among them.

Both Earlier and Latter Seven Masters had a significant influence on the poets of Ming China, and their poetic style remained popular for many decades. However, some literati believed that their principles were too restrictive, leading to mere imitation without any originality. One such poet was Xue Hui (), as well as Yang Tinghe&#x27;s son, Yang Shen, whose work gained many admirers. His most prized collection of poems was the one he exchanged with his wife, Huang E, who was also a talented poet, while he was living in exile after 1524. Despite the prevailing trend of admiration for &quot;Tang poetry and Han prose,&quot; the Eight Talents of the Jiajing era stood out by modeling their writing after the authors of the Tang and Song dynasties. The most notable among the Eight Talents were Li Kaixian, Wang Shenzhong (), and Tang Shunzhi ().

In the genre of northern &quot;zayu&quot; plays, Kang Hai and Wang Jiusi were important dramatists. Following them, Li Kaixian focused on drama, publishing Yuan &quot;zayu&quot; and composing plays in the southern style of &quot;chuanqi&quot;. Xu Wei, the most renowned Ming author of &quot;zayu&quot;, followed in his footsteps. However, Li Kaixian&#x27;s generation was the last to excel in northern drama, as the plays of the south began to dominate.

==Military and foreign policy==
===Turpan===
In 1513, Mansur, the Sultan of Turpan, invaded Hami and caused destruction in the Chinese territories to the east. Sayyid Husayn, who was Mansur&#x27;s envoy in Beijing, negotiated a deal where Mansur would keep Hami and the (tribute) trade would be reinstated. However, in 1521, Sayyid was executed for treason and the Turpan delegation was expelled from Beijing. This led to a hostile attitude towards Turpan, enforced by Yang Tinghe. As a result, fighting resumed and in 1524, the Turpans also attacked Ganzhou. Ming troops, mostly composed of Mongols, successfully defended against the attackers, but the conflict continued until 1528 when Mansur returned to a strategy of small raids.

In 1528, the western border once again became a point of contention. Ilan, one of Mansur&#x27;s generals, sought asylum in Ming territory. Mansur demanded his extradition in exchange for Hami. Additionally, he requested the resumption of trade, which had been halted in 1524. Wang Qiong, Minister of War in charge of the western borders, along with Zhang Fujing and Gui E, supported the resumption of trade. However, there were voices of opposition, arguing that showing leniency without a formal apology would not be beneficial in the long run. Despite this, the emperor ultimately decided to grant Mansur&#x27;s request. As a result, the western border was pacified, and the Ming government was able to focus on dealing with the increasingly aggressive Mongols, who had become more hostile after 1528.

===Đại Việt===
In 1537, a debate erupted at the Ming court regarding Đại Việt (present-day northern Vietnam). This was sparked by the birth of the emperor&#x27;s son in November 1536, when messages were sent to neighboring countries to share the joyous news. However, Grand Secretary Xia Yan refused to include Đại Việt in these messages, citing the country&#x27;s failure to send tribute for the past twenty years and the illegitimacy of its current ruler, Mạc Thái Tông of the Mạc dynasty. In response, the Minister of War and the militarist faction in the government, led by Guo Xun (), Marquis of Wuding, proposed a punitive expedition. This proposal was met with criticism for being extravagant and costly. Yan Song also spoke out against the proposal.

In March 1537, envoys from the legitimate Viet ruler, Lê Trang Tông of the Lê dynasty, arrived in Beijing seeking assistance against the Mạc dynasty. The Jiajing Emperor responded by sending officials to investigate the situation, which he perceived as an affront to his majesty. He initially considered military action, but local authorities in Guangdong objected, arguing that the Viets had not crossed the border and the outcome of their civil war was uncertain. Despite these protests, a decision was made in May to go to war. However, after further objections from regional officials, the emperor began to waver and ultimately cancelled military preparations in June. In September 1537, new proposals from the other local officials convinced him to resume preparations for war.

In the spring of 1538, the Jiajing Emperor appointed a campaign commander. However, after the border authorities calculated the expected costs and problems of the war and the Ministry of War responded to the emperor&#x27;s inquiry by submitting the matter to inter-ministerial consultations, the emperor ultimately decided to cancel the war. However, the gathering of 110,000 troops in Guangxi during preparations for war alarmed Mạc Thái Tông. In an attempt to avert an invasion in 1540, Mạc Thái Tông ceded disputed border territories to the Ming Empire and accepted the subordinate status of his state. 

This event left the Jiajing Emperor with the impression that his officials were more concerned with their personal interests than the well-being of the state and that they were unable to come up with a sound policy. By 1540, the Jiajing Emperor had become increasingly isolated from his government and saw it as an obstacle to the proper administration of the country.

===The Mongols===

As a result of internal conflicts among the Mongols, the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s government did not have much to worry about in the first decade of his reign, and their raids were rare. However, the Ming army itself posed a significant problem. As early as the 16th century, difficulties in the border garrisons were on the rise. In 1510, soldiers killed the governor of Ningxia, and in 1521, the governor of Gansu met the same fate. In August 1524, officers and soldiers in Datong killed the governor and burned government buildings. Although the unrest was temporarily quelled by the execution of the rebellion&#x27;s leaders in April 1525, the Datong rebellion, which was linked to the death of the garrison commander, resurfaced in 1533. Smaller rebellions also occurred in 1535 and 1539, and in 1545, members of the imperial family also rose up. The government&#x27;s response to these rebellions was typically to make concessions, which ultimately failed to address the underlying issues.

After the political situation in Mongolia stabilized, the Mongols began to stage raids on Ming territory every spring and early autumn. These raids were often successful due to the incapacitation of Ming garrisons, making them an effective substitute for trade for the Mongols. In contrast to Đại Việt, the emperor showed a clear preference for using force in his relations with the Mongols and rejected proposals to restore trade. However, Altan Khan, who solidified his rule over the Mongols in the steppes west and south of the Gobi Desert in the 1540s, desired Chinese goods. His attacks on Ming territory were motivated by his need for funds to wage war against the Oirats, as well as supplies to alleviate the effects of droughts and famines in the 1540s and 1550s.

The Ming troops were successful in defending against smaller raids, but they were unable to stop large-scale Mongol attacks involving tens of thousands of horsemen. By the time enough forces were gathered, the Mongols had already retreated back to the steppe. In response, the Ming government focused on strengthening their defenses and building fortifications, for which the emperor was willing to allocate significant funds. They also worked on improving discipline and intelligence activities. However, they failed to address the root causes of these raids.

During the 1540s and 1550s, Altan Khan repeatedly requested the restoration of trade. However, the emperor refused, leading the Mongols to resort to force in order to obtain the resources they needed. This resulted in a series of raids and plundering, including the plundering of Shanxi in 1541–1543 and the vicinity of Beijing in the late 1540s. By 1550, the Mongols had even reached the walls of Beijing. In an attempt to calm the situation, the emperor allowed the opening of border markets in the spring of 1551. However, after only six months, he closed the markets again and the Mongols resumed their raids. The Eastern Mongols also joined in on the attacks, plundering Liaodong in the early 1550s. This continued for the next two decades, with the entire northern frontier constantly under threat. The Chinese, for their part, focused on defending the passes that led to the North China Plain and Beijing.

===Military reforms in the early 1550s===

The failure of the Beijing garrison to defend against the Mongol invasion in 1550 prompted reforms, resulting in the abolition of 12 divisions and the western and eastern special detachments. These were replaced by the Three Great Camps, totaling 147,000 soldiers. These three corps were under the command of Qiu Luan, who held the title of Superintendent Commander-in-chief (; &quot;zongdu jingying rongzheng&quot;) and had gained recognition from the emperor for his role in the battles against the Mongols. However, after Qiu Luan&#x27;s death in 1552, the commander&#x27;s powers were limited and the position was eventually abolished in 1570. The three corps then operated independently with their own headquarters. 

In 1552, the emperor, recognizing the unreliability of the Beijing garrison, established the Palace Army (; &quot;Neiwufu&quot;) made up of eunuchs. The following year, the southern suburbs of Beijing, known as the &quot;Outer City&quot;, were fortified.

===Sea ban policy and problems with pirates===

Foreign maritime trade of the Ming dynasty was heavily restricted by the &quot;sea ban&quot; policy, which aimed to limit trade to tribute exchange and prohibited unlicensed private trading. However, the government was unable to effectively enforce these restrictions, and illegal overseas trade became a significant part of the coastal economy.

In the late 15th century, Southeast China, particularly the Jiangnan region along the lower Yangtze River, experienced a surge in population, the development of communication networks, commercialization, and the growth of critical thinking. As officials with a more favorable view towards trade began to join the government, debates emerged regarding the effectiveness and relevance of the existing anti-trade policy. During the reign of the Jiajing Emperor, the government became divided on the issue. Two factions, one advocating for the legalization of foreign trade to prevent costly wars and eliminate the root causes of conflict, and the other representing conservative landowners who believed in maintaining prohibitions and viewed war as inevitable for the sake of the country&#x27;s security and stability, clashed over the authorization of foreign trade.
In the 1520s and 1530s, there was a rise in pirate attacks and related violence along the southeast coast from Zhejiang to Guangdong. The Jiajing government attempted to address this issue by implementing repeated bans on private maritime trade, even going as far as prohibiting the construction of ships with two or more masts. Despite the efforts of conservatives, maritime trade continued to grow significantly in the second third of the 16th century. In fact, during the 15th and 16th centuries, the Ming state gradually shifted to using silver as a form of taxation due to the lack of other options, but silver mining was limited and the state was unable to ensure its import through the tribute system. As a result, the highly profitable importation of silver became the domain of smugglers.

The bans on private maritime trade were difficult to enforce, as the local military garrisons were ill-equipped to deal with the pirates. The soldiers lacked proper training and discipline, and the officers were often involved in illegal trade themselves. Furthermore, lax enforcement of the bans was supported by some high-ranking officials, including Grand Secretary Zhang Fujing.

In the 1540s, groups of smugglers and pirates united and grew stronger, building bases on islands off the coast. From the mid-1520s, their center was the port of Shuangyu in the Zhoushan archipelago near Ningbo, where the Portuguese arrived in 1539 and the Japanese in 1545. In the late 1540s and 1550s, violence reached its peak as raids by pirates and smugglers not only affected the countryside, but also the suburbs of major cities such as Hangzhou and Jiaxing. However, in the latter half of the 1550s, a group of officials led by Hu Zongxian and their generals Yu Dayou and Qi Jiguang managed to break up the smuggling groups and restore order in Zhejiang. By 1563, they had successfully cleared Fujian and by the mid-1560s, Guangdong and Guangxi. As a result, piracy was no longer a serious problem.

The Jiajing Emperor refused to lift the bans; it was only after his death in 1567 that a request to abolish the sea ban policy and allow &quot;trade with both the western and eastern seas&quot; was successful. Trade was then concentrated in Fujian&#x27;s Moon Port (Yuegang), while trade with Japan remained strictly prohibited.

===Portugal===

In 1513, the first Portuguese arrived in China. King Manuel I of Portugal attempted to establish official relations with Ming China. However, the envoy Tomé Pires, who arrived with Fernão Pires de Andrade&#x27;s squadron in 1517, was unsuccessful in gaining acceptance from the Zhengde Emperor. After the Zhengde Emperor&#x27;s death in 1521, the new Jiajing government also refused to accept the Portuguese and sent Pires back to Guangzhou. In the same year, the Ming fleet defeated the Portuguese at the Battle of Tunmen. The conservative members of the government used the Portuguese occupation of Malacca, a former Chinese vassal, ten years prior as justification for rejecting the envoy. Upon returning to Guangzhou, Pires was accused by local authorities of being responsible for the violent behavior (including the kidnapping of children) of his comrades. He was arrested and died in prison in 1524.

In the 1530s and 1540s, the Portuguese were involved in the illegal trade between China and Japan. It was not until the 1550s that relations between the two countries were normalized. Starting in 1549, the Chinese allowed Portuguese traders to visit Shangchuan Island in Guangdong annually. In 1557, the Portuguese were able to gain official permission, through bribery of local officials, to establish a trading colony in Macao. In the 1550s and 1560s, as Chinese merchants had limited access to Japan due to the fight against pirates along the coast, the Portuguese became the main intermediary for trade between Japan and China.

==Death and legacy==
In the 1560s, the emperor suffered from the effects of immortality potions, insomnia, and mood swings. He was often ill, failing to issue written orders after 11 November 1566 due to his poor health, and eventually died at his palace in the West Park on 23 January 1567. He was buried in the Yong Mausoleum in the Ming tombs near Beijing. He was given the temple name Shizong and the (abbreviated) posthumous name Emperor Su.

The Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s reign was perceived positively in the immediate years following, with the emperor being described in the &quot;Veritable Records&quot; of his reign as a resolute and knowledgeable ruler who revitalized the land after the excesses of his predecessor Zhengde Emperor. He also brought order to ceremonies and successfully defended against barbarian threats from the north and the sea. The authors of the &quot;Veritable Records&quot; praised him for being active and energetic, strict with officials but sympathetic to the people, and devoted to his family. However, he was known to prefer the company of sycophants who would not contradict him, and was vain and unwilling to admit his mistakes. He was also known for harsh and cruel punishments, as well as generous and swift rewards.

During the reign of the Jiajing Emperor, the political system achieved a certain level of stability. However, this stability was marred by tense relations between the government and the emperor, which continued even during the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1572–1620). Like his predecessor, the Zhengde Emperor, the Jiajing Emperor attempted to assert his authority over the state bureaucracy, but ultimately failed. Conflicts with officials centered around the role of the emperor, who was expected to act as an impartial judge in government discussions and carry out rituals in accordance with Neo-Confucian teachings. However, the emperors saw this role as too restrictive and their attempts to assert their authority were unsuccessful. Driven by their own interests, officials were able to influence government policies despite the emperor&#x27;s wishes.

One example of the emperor&#x27;s failure was his handling of land registration for tax purposes. In the early 16th century, a significant amount of taxable land was not included in tax registers, and newly cultivated land was also left out. Liu Jin attempted to register hereditary soldiers in the first years of the 16th century, but was unsuccessful. Another attempt to register newly cultivated land at the beginning of the Jiajing era also failed. In fact, in 1512, 1531, and 1545, officials were able to expand tax exemptions, further hindering the collection of tax revenues. Additionally, the state failed to enforce the ban on maritime trade, resulting in lost tax revenues from illegal trade. As a result, profits from improved agricultural practices, industrial development, crafts, and trade remained in the hands of private individuals, while the state received only a small portion of them. While the economy flourished, the state treasury did not.

==Family==

The Jiajing Emperor had three empresses during his reign. The first, Lady Chen, was chosen for him by his aunt, Empress Dowager Zhang. Lady Chen became empress in 1522, but in 1528, she suffered a miscarriage and died on 21 October of that year due to a dispute with the emperor. The emperor showed his displeasure towards her by giving her a modest burial and the posthumous name Daoling (). However, in 1536, on the advice of Xia Yan, the name was changed to Xiaojiesu.

The second empress, surnamed Zhang, was the daughter of a guard officer and entered the palace in 1526. After the death of Lady Chen, the Jiajing Emperor chose her as the new empress and she officially ascended on 8 January 1529. However, in early 1534, she was inexplicably deposed, possibly due to her intervention on behalf of the emperor&#x27;s aunt, Empress Dowager Zhang. She died in 1536.

The third empress, Lady Fang, came from the south, specifically from the Nanjing region. She entered the palace in 1530 and on 28 January 1534 (nine days after her predecessor&#x27;s deposition), she became empress. Jiajing is said to have chosen her because she shared his views on ceremonies. In 1542, she thwarted an assassination attempt on the emperor by a group of palace women. However, the emperor held a grudge against her for the death of one of his favorites, who was executed by Lady Fang&#x27;s decision after the assassination. In 1547, when the palace caught fire, the emperor refused to issue an order to save her, resulting in her death. Despite this, he gave Lady Fang a lavish funeral and bestowed upon her an auspicious posthumous name.

The emperor had a total of eight sons and five daughters, but only two sons and two daughters survived into adulthood. The eldest son died at the young age of two months (born September 7 – died 27 October 1533). The second son, Zhu Zairui (20 October 1536 – 14 April 1549), was declared the heir to the throne in 1539. The third son, Zhu Zaiji, was born to a concubine surnamed Du (who died on 12 February 1554). He was appointed as the Prince of Yu in 1539, while the fourth son of Zhu Zaizhen became the Prince of Jing. However, after the death of Zhu Zairui in 1549, the emperor struggled to choose a new successor, leading to rivalry between the two remaining princes. Eventually, in 1561, the Prince of Jing left Beijing for his residence in Anlu, Huguang, where he died on 9 February 1565. After the death of the Jiajing Emperor in 1567, Zhu Zaiji ascended the throne as the Longqing Emperor.

The Jiajing Emperor had a strained relationship with his relatives, particularly his aunt, Empress Zhang (widow of the Hongzhi Emperor). He harbored resentment towards her due to their differing attitudes towards his parents during the Great Rites Controversy. In 1525, when her palace burned down, the Jiajing Emperor refused to rebuild it and instead relocated her to a smaller residence. In 1533, he had her younger brother, Zhang Yanling, arrested after it was revealed that he had committed murder in 1515 and then killed a guard officer who was blackmailing him for the first murder. Zhang Yanling was executed in 1546. Another brother, Zhang Heling, was arrested in late 1537 on false charges of witchcraft. The accusers were eventually exiled, but Zhang Heling died after a month in prison. After the death of Empress Dowager Zhang in 1541, the Jiajing Emperor gave her a simple burial with minimal ceremony. He also refused to mourn for Empress Xia, the widow of the Zhengde Emperor, who died in February 1535.

<text>The Longqing Emperor (4March 15375July 1572), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Muzong of Ming, personal name Zhu Zaiji, art name Shunzhai, was the 13th emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1567 to 1572. He was initially known as the Prince of Yu () from 1539 to 1567 before he became the emperor. He succeeded his father, the Jiajing Emperor.

After the death of the Jiajing Emperor, the new Longqing Emperor inherited a country in turmoil due to years of mismanagement and corruption. Recognizing the extent of the chaos caused during his father&#x27;s lengthy reign, the emperor worked to restore order in the state administration. He reinstated talented officials who had been previously exiled and dismissed corrupt officials and Taoist priests who had surrounded the Jiajing Emperor. Additionally, he lifted the ban on foreign trade, boosting the empire&#x27;s economy, and reorganized the border troops to strengthen security on the inland and coastal borders. The seaports of Zhejiang and Fujian were fortified to defend against coastal pirates, who had been a constant nuisance during the previous government. The emperor also successfully repelled Altan Khan&#x27;s Mongol army, which had breached the Great Wall and reached Beijing. A peace treaty was signed shortly after, allowing for the resumption of the exchange of horses for silk.

During the reign of the Longqing Emperor, like many previous Ming emperors, there was a heavy reliance on court eunuchs. One particular eunuch, Meng Cong (), who was supported by Grand Secretary Gao Gong, gained control over the inner court towards the end of the emperor&#x27;s reign. Despite a promising start, the Longqing Emperor quickly neglected his duties as a ruler and instead focused on personal pleasures, much to the disappointment of his reform-minded advisors. The emperor also made contradictory decisions by re-employing Taoist priests, whom he had previously banned at the beginning of his reign.

==Early life==
Zhu Zaiji, the future Longqing Emperor, was born on 4 March 1537 to the Jiajing Emperor and a concubine surnamed Du. He was the emperor&#x27;s third son; the eldest son had died in infancy before Zhu Zaiji&#x27;s birth, and his second son, Zhu Zairui, was six months older than him. A month after Zhu Zaiji&#x27;s birth, the emperor&#x27;s fourth son, Zhu Zaizhen, was born.

In February 1539, the Jiajing Emperor created Zhu Zairui the crown prince. On the same day, Zhu Zaiji was granted the title of Prince of Yu, and the fourth son of Zhu Zaizhen was given the title of Prince of Jing. In 1549, Crown Prince Zhu Zairui died. His death caused the Jiajing Emperor to feel immense sorrow and regret, as he believed he had not listened to the supposed advice of his Taoist priest Tao Zhongwen, who had warned him that &quot;two dragons should not face each other&quot;. This may have been the reason why he refused to create another crown prince, and also avoided seeing Zhu Zaiji. Another version suggests that the emperor held a grudge against Zhu Zaiji for not observing sexual abstinence during the mourning period (this version was fueled by the fact that Zhu Zaiji had a son in October 1555, only 18 months after his mother&#x27;s death).

In September 1552, Zhu Zaiji and his younger brother began receiving education together. Two months later, their wives were chosen and they were married in February 1553. After that, Zhu Zaiji moved from the Forbidden City to his princely palace. For thirteen years, he lived outside the Forbidden City, gaining experience of conditions beyond the Imperial Palace and developing an understanding of the country&#x27;s issues. The Jiajing Emperor ensured that he and the officials treated the third and fourth sons equally, sparking speculation at court about who would be the new successor. This speculation was further fueled by the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s fondness for the mother of the younger Zhu Zaizhen, with whom he spent a lot of time. In contrast, when Zhu Zaiji&#x27;s mother died in February 1554, the funeral arrangements had to be revised twice, as the Jiajing Emperor suppressed any insinuation that she held a higher status than just the mother of the presumptive successor.

In March 1560, the Jiajing Emperor received a memorandum suggesting that Zhu Zaiji be appointed as his successor. In response, the emperor was outraged and ordered the execution of the writer. However, later that year, he changed his mind and ordered Zhu Zaizhen to go to his seat in Anlu, Huguang. This decision strengthened Zhu Zaiji&#x27;s position, although he continued to be excluded from the emperor&#x27;s entourage and neglected. Unlike the deceased Zhu Zairui, the emperor did not like him. Despite being 29 years old at the time of his accession to the throne and having a Confucian education, Zhu Zaiji lacked deep knowledge in statesmanship and was not adequately prepared to govern an empire.

==Beginning of reign==
The Jiajing Emperor died on 23 January 1567, and twelve days later, Zhu Zaiji became the new emperor. He apdopted the era name Longqing, which means &quot;great celebration&quot;.

The reign of the Longqing Emperor began with the implementation of the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s &quot;dying orders&quot;, which aimed to bring about reform and political change. Senior Grand Secretary Xu Jie, in collaboration with Zhang Juzheng, drafted the &quot;final edict&quot; of the Jiajing Emperor and the first edicts of the Longqing Emperor&#x27;s reign, which were approved by Longqing himself. These edicts, with the goal of &quot;removing the bad&quot; and &quot;introducing the new&quot;, revoked the unpopular policies of the Jiajing Emperor and introduced long-awaited reforms. The Taoist priests who had held significant influence during the previous era were imprisoned and their rituals were banned. The orders to gather ingredients for their rituals were also cancelled. The area in West Park, which was built by the Jiajing Emperor and modeled after the Taoist Immortal Lands, was dismantled. Officials who had been punished for opposing the policies of the Jiajing Emperor were pardoned and released from prison. Those who were still alive were reinstated to their positions, and those who had died were given posthumous honors. These reforms were generally well-received.

In the long term, the most noteworthy event during the early days of the Longqing Emperor&#x27;s reign was the selection of Zhang Juzheng as Grand Secretary. Zhang had been the emperor&#x27;s tutor since 1563, and the emperor saw him as a man with exceptional abilities. Throughout the Longqing Emperor&#x27;s reign, Zhang&#x27;s power and influence increased, and after the emperor&#x27;s died, he swiftly rose to the position of Senior Grand Secretary. He became the most influential politician in the Ming government for a decade and was considered the most competent administrator of the late Ming dynasty.

In the years that followed, the reforms persisted, with the Longqing Emperor approving changes proposed by experienced statesmen such as Gao Gong, Chen Yiqin, and Zhang Juzheng. An evaluation was conducted on the government officials, including those from the princely households. Competent officials were promoted, while inadequate ones were removed from their positions. Taxes for those affected by natural disasters were lowered, and land surveys and tax records were updated. Restrictions were placed on certain expenses for the imperial household.

However, Xu Jie, Senior Grand Secretary at the beginning of the Longqing Emperor&#x27;s reign, had already rejected the cooperation of Grand Secretaries Gao Gong and Guo Pu when writing the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s &quot;final edict&quot;. Instead, he invited Zhang Juzheng, who was then the director of the Hanlin Academy. This caused a conflict with his colleagues in the secretariat. A contemporary commentator sadly remarked on this, noting that such capable men were unable to work together for the good of the empire and instead became mortal enemies. In the summer of 1567, Gao Gong was dismissed from the Grand Secretariat, followed by Xu Jie the following year. When Gao Gong returned to office in the early 1570s, he and his followers sought revenge against Xu and his sons.

==Character==
The information available about the Longqing Emperor is vague and contradictory. While official history praises his thrift and humanity, it seems that this is simply the usual rhetoric. It is noted that he was not naturally strong or ambitious, in contrast to his father. He was known for being friendly and kind, and during his reign, there were fewer severe punishments for high officials compared to previous years. However, he lacked his father&#x27;s drive for power, as well as his temper and cruelty. Additionally, he did not possess the same strength of faith in Taoism as his father, the Jiajing Emperor. The Longqing Emperor also suffered from a speech defect, which caused him to only speak to his eunuchs. In public, he was always silent and even during formal events, his Grand Secretaries would deliver his lines for him.

He was perceived to have average intelligence at best, but he was determined to be taken seriously. He implemented reforms and policy changes during his reign, particularly in relation to the Jiajing Emperor. He was successful in strengthening his government by aligning himself with capable politicians, a rarity during the Ming dynasty. While his minimal involvement in state affairs did not have a negative impact, as competent ministers and Grand Secretaries were responsible for handling them, it did lead to a power struggle within the Grand Secretariat. The winner of this struggle would have the authority to make final decisions on state matters. Gao Gong, who had been one of the Longqing Emperor&#x27;s closest mentors during his youth, was able to consolidate power as the head of the Grand Secretariat (and also held the title of Minister of Personnel) more than any of his predecessors.

Within months of ascending to the throne, he became disinterested in matters of state and instead devoted much of his time to extravagant parties with his consorts, indulging in opulence and living extravagantly. It is rumored that he sought entertainment and luxury as a means of compensating for years of neglect and deprivation. Concerned officials began to voice their objections, citing his declining health and exhaustion, both physically and mentally.

==Trade==

During the Longqing era, the government adopted a more open approach to trade compared to the previous Jiajing regime. In 1567, the grand coordinator of Fujian proposed to abolish the &quot;Haijin&quot; policy, which was approved by the government and the emperor. This led to the restoration of maritime inspection offices and the legalization of foreign trade, primarily in Yuegang (Moon Port) in Fujian. However, trade with Japan remained prohibited. The relaxation of legal restrictions resulted in a significant increase in trade. 

In addition to the southeast coast, the northern borders were also opened as part of a new reconciliation policy, allowing for trade with the Mongols.

==Financial policy==
(Bronze) coins, also known as coppers, were primarily used along the Grand Canal in the mid-16th century, causing a shortage in other areas and hindering trade. In 1567, Minister of Revenue, Ge Shouli (), suggested resuming production of these coins due to their importance in the daily lives of urban citizens. He believed that losing control over the currency would also mean losing control over the entire economy, as silver and those who profited from it would dominate. However, the Ministry of Works rejected the proposal, citing the high cost of casting the coins, which was twice their value. Opponents of the minister argued that the existing coins were sufficient for the limited regions where they were in circulation.

Later, in the years 1569–1570, the emperor was convinced by Minister of War Tan Lun and Left Vice Minister of Personnel Jin Xueyan () to reopen the mints. They argued that it was necessary to increase the money supply during a silver shortage, as this would lead to a decrease in the price of silver and an increase in the value of goods. They also believed that a medium of exchange was needed to prevent the wealthy from hoarding silver and causing a shortage, and that using silver for payments was disadvantageous for smaller payers. However, their proposal was met with opposition from Gao Gong, who argued that having two currencies would lead to the state manipulating their exchange rate and causing mistrust among the population. Despite this, the mints were only open for a short period of time, until the death of the Longqing Emperor.

==Military and foreign policy==
In foreign affairs, the Longqing era was a period of peace. Apart from Guangdong, the pirate raids, so devastating in the Jiajing era, subsided.

The grand military parade held in the autumn of 1569 was a momentous occasion. (The previous parade had taken place in 1429 and the next one would not occur until 1581.) As part of the parade, incompetent officers were dismissed and the units underwent rigorous training. Despite the high cost, it greatly boosted the morale of both the soldiers and the onlookers. The vibrant spectacle, with the emperor at its center, was meticulously planned by Zhang Juzheng, who was dedicated to fortifying border defenses and revitalizing the military. Apart from uplifting the spirits of the troops, the parade also provided a refreshing break from the monotonous palace life for the emperor.

Immediately after the parade, the Mongol army led by Altan Khan breached the Great Wall and ravaged the northern border regions. Prior to this, there had been fighting in the winter of 1567/68, during which Ming troops not only defended their territory but also made several forays into the Mongolian steppes. However, in the early 1570s, the Ming dynasty&#x27;s long-term policy towards the Mongols changed. Gao Gong and Zhang Juzheng, in addition to strengthening the border troops, pursued a policy of appeasement and negotiated peace with Altan Khan in 1571. As part of the agreement, the Ming dynasty opened border markets where the Mongols could trade their horses and other surplus goods for Chinese goods. Altan Khan was also granted the title of Prince of Shunyi (Obedience and Righteousness) by the Longqing Emperor.

==Death==

The emperor died on 5 July 1572 at the age of thirty-five. Prior to his death, he entrusted ministers Gao Gong, Zhang Juzheng, and Gao Yi () with the responsibility of managing state affairs and serving as loyal advisors to his ten-year-old son, the Wanli Emperor.

The Longqing Emperor was buried in Zhao Mausoleum, one of the Ming tombs located near Beijing. He was given the posthumous name Emperor Zhuang () and the temple name Muzong ().

==Family==
The Longqing Emperor had four sons and seven daughters. His first son, Zhu Yiyi (October 1555 – May 1559, posthumous name &quot;Xianhuai&quot;), was born to his first wife. His second son died as an infant. The third son, Zhu Yijun, inherited the throne. The fourth son, Zhu Yiliu (1568–1614, posthumous name &quot;Jian&quot;), held the title of Prince of Lu and resided in Weihui, Henan. Both Zhu Yijun and Zhu Yiliu were born to one of the Longqing Emperor&#x27;s concubines, surnamed Li. Out of the seven daughters, only four survived into adulthood.

<text>The Wanli Emperor (4 September 1563 – 18 August 1620), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Shenzong of Ming, personal name Zhu Yijun, art name Yuzhai, was the 14th emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1572 to 1620. He succeeded his father, the Longqing Emperor. His reign of 48 years was the longest among all the Ming dynasty emperors.

The Wanli Emperor ascended the throne at the age of nine. During the first ten years of his reign, the young emperor was assisted and effectively led by Grand Secretary and skilled administrator, Zhang Juzheng. With the support of the emperor&#x27;s mother, Lady Li, and the imperial eunuchs led by Feng Bao, the country experienced economic and military prosperity, reaching a level of power not seen since the early 15th century. The emperor held great respect and appreciation for his Grand Secretary. However, as time passed, various factions within the government openly opposed Zhang, causing his influential position in the government and at court to become a burden for the monarch. In 1582, Zhang died and within months, the emperor dismissed Feng Bao. He then gained discretion and made significant changes to Zhang&#x27;s administrative arrangements.

The Wanli era was marked by a significant boom in industry, particularly in the production of silk, cotton, and porcelain. Agriculture also experienced growth, and there was a notable increase in both interregional and foreign trade. This development had the strongest impact in Jiangnan, where cities such as Suzhou, Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Nanjing flourished. However, despite the overall economic growth of the empire, the state&#x27;s finances remained in a poor state. While wealthy merchants and gentry enjoyed a life of splendor, the majority of peasants and day laborers continued to live in poverty.

The closing decade of the 16th century was marked by three major campaigns. A large rebellion in Ningxia was quelled by a Ming force of 40,000 soldiers by October 1592, allowing them to shift their focus to Korea. Concurrently, Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Korea with 200,000 soldiers, leading to a joint Korean-Chinese force, including 40,000 Ming soldiers, pushing the Japanese out of most of Korea and forcing them to retreat to the southeast coast by 1593. In 1597, a second Japanese invasion was thwarted, and the suppression of the Yang Yinglong rebellion in southwest China concluded in a few months from 1599 due to Ming forces concentrating there amidst the ongoing war with Japan.

Over time, the emperor grew increasingly disillusioned with the constant moralizing attacks and counterattacks from officials, causing him to become increasingly isolated. In the 1580s and 1590s, he attempted to promote his third son, Zhu Changxun (the son of his favorite concubine, Lady Zheng), as crown prince, but faced strong opposition from officials. This led to ongoing conflicts between the emperor and his ministers for over fifteen years. Eventually, the emperor gave in and appointed his eldest son, Zhu Changluo (later the Taichang Emperor), as crown prince in October 1601. In 1596, the Wanli Emperor attempted to establish a parallel administration composed of eunuchs, separate from the officials who had traditionally governed the empire. However, this effort was abandoned in 1606. As a result, the governance of the country remained in the hands of Confucian intellectuals, who were often embroiled in disputes with each other. The opposition Donglin movement continued to criticize the emperor and his followers, while pro-government officials were divided based on their regional origins.

In the final years of the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s reign, the Jurchens grew stronger on the northeastern frontiers and posed a significant threat. In 1619, they defeated the Ming armies in the Battle of Sarhu and captured part of Liaodong.

==Childhood and accession==
Zhu Yijun, the future Wanli Emperor, was born on 4 September 1563 to Zhu Zaiji, the heir to the throne of the Ming dynasty, and one of his concubines, Lady Li. He had two older brothers, both of whom died in early childhood before 1563, and a younger brother, Zhu Yiliu (; 1568–1614), who was created Prince of Lu in 1571.

Zhu Zaiji became emperor of the Ming dynasty in 1567 and reigned as the Longqing Emperor, but he died five years later on 5 July 1572. Zhu Yijun then ascended the throne two weeks later on 19 July 1572. He adopted the era name Wanli, which means &quot;ten thousand calendars&quot;. Before his death, the Longqing Emperor instructed minister Zhang Juzheng to take charge of state affairs and become a devoted adviser to the young emperor.

The Wanli Emperor was known for his restless and energetic nature during his youth. He was described as a quick learner, intelligent, and perceptive, always staying well-informed about the happenings in the empire. Zhang Juzheng assigned eight teachers to educate the Wanli Emperor in Confucianism, history, and calligraphy. The history lessons focused on teaching him about good and bad examples of governance, and Zhang Juzheng personally compiled a collection of historical stories for the emperor to learn from. However, the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s fascination with calligraphy concerned Zhang, who feared that this &quot;empty pastime&quot; would distract him from his duties as a statesman. As a result, Zhang gradually stopped the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s calligraphy lessons. From 1583 to 1588, the Wanli Emperor visited several mausoleums near Beijing and paid attention to the training of the palace guard. However, his mother, Zhang Juzheng, and high-ranking officials in Beijing were worried that he would become a ruler similar to the Zhengde Emperor (reigned 1505–1521), and discouraged him from traveling outside the Forbidden City and pursuing his interests in the military, horse riding, and archery. Under their pressure, the Wanli Emperor stopped leaving Beijing after 1588 and stopped participating in public sacrifices after 1591. He also canceled the morning audience (held before dawn) and the evening study of Confucianism (after sunset). In his youth, the Wanli Emperor was obedient to his mother and showed respect towards eunuchs and the Grand Secretaries. However, as he grew older, he became cynical and skeptical towards rituals and bureaucrats. His opposition to ritualized royal duties linked him to his grandfather the Jiajing Emperor (reigned 1521–1567), but he lacked the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s decisiveness and flamboyance. Instead of the Jiajing Emperor&#x27;s passion for Taoism, the Wanli Emperor leaned towards Buddhism.

In the first period of his rule, he displayed a strong commitment to the well-being of his people, actively combating corruption and striving to improve border defense. His mother, a devout Buddhist, had a significant influence on him, leading him to rarely impose the death penalty. However, one punished official claimed that his leniency was sometimes excessive. Despite this, he was not afraid to use violence against offending officials, although he did not make it a regular practice. He was known to be both vulnerable and vengeful, but also generous. However, since the mid-1580s, he began to gain weight and his health deteriorated. In 1589, he cited long-term dizziness, accompanied by fevers, heatstroke, eczema, diarrhea, and general weakness as reasons for his absence from audiences. It is believed that his health issues were linked to his regular use of opium.

Zhang Juzheng and his mother raised the Wanli Emperor to be modest in material possessions and exemplary in behavior, which he saw as a humiliation that he never forgot. However, upon learning that Zhang Juzheng himself lived in luxury, the Wanli Emperor was deeply affected. This display of double standards hardened his attitude towards officials and made him cynical about moral challenges. Two years after Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s death, his family was accused of illegal land dealings, and the Wanli Emperor severely punished them by confiscating their property and sending Zhang&#x27;s sons to the border troops.

==Reign as emperor==
===Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s administration (1572–1582)===
At the end of the Longqing Emperor&#x27;s reign, the Grand Secretariat and Government were headed by Senior Grand Secretary and Minister of Rites Gao Gong. However, after the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s accession, the eunuch Feng Bao (), head of the Directorate of Ceremonial (the most important eunuch office in the imperial palace), worked with Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng to depose Gao Gong. Zhang Juzheng then took over as head of the Grand Secretariat and remained in power for ten years until his death in 1582. In response to the Mongol raids in the 1550s, Zhang aimed to &quot;enrich the country and strengthen the army&quot;, using legalistic methods rather than Confucian ones. He sought to centralize the government and increase the emperor&#x27;s authority at the expense of local interests by streamlining the administration and strengthening the military. This included closing local academies and placing the investigating censors under the Grand Secretariat&#x27;s control. Zhang had the support of eunuchs, particularly Feng Bao, and the emperor&#x27;s mother, who acted as regent. He was able to handpick his colleagues in the Grand Secretariat and informally control the Ministry of Rites and the Censorate, appointing his followers to important positions in central offices and regions. This gave him significant influence in the government, although he did not have the authority to issue orders or demands. Zhang also attempted to redirect the control officials from seeking revenge against each other and instead focus on collecting taxes and suppressing bandits. As a result, the efficiency of the Ming state administration improved between 1572 and 1582, reaching a level that had only been achieved in the early days of the empire.

Zhang Juzheng implemented a series of reforms during his time in office, including the conversion of tax payments from goods to silver (known as the Single whip reform), changes to the military peasant system, and between 1572 and 1579, revised the accounts of county offices regarding corvée labor and various fees and surcharges. In 1580–1582, a new cadastre was also created. These reforms were formalized across the empire with the publication of revised lists of taxpayers&#x27; duties, now converted to a unified payment in silver. As part of the administrative reforms, unnecessary activities were abolished or limited, the number of Confucian students receiving state support was reduced, and provincial authorities were urged to only require one-third of the previous amount of corvée labor. Additionally, the services provided by post offices were reduced. Despite these changes, taxes remained at their original level and tax arrears were strictly enforced. Zhang Juzheng was able to accumulate a surplus of income over expenditure. This was a significant achievement, as the Ming state typically operated without reserves in the 16th century. However, Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s administration was able to save money and improve tax collection, resulting in considerable reserves. In 1582, the granaries around the capital held nine years&#x27; worth of grain, the &quot;Taicang&quot; treasury () of the Ministry of Revenue contained 6 million &quot;liang&quot; (about 223 tons) of silver, the Court of the Imperial Stud () held another 4 million, and an additional 2.5 million was available in Nanjing. Smaller reserves were also available to provincial administrations in Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Guangxi. Despite these achievements, there were no institutional changes during Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s time in office. He simply made existing processes more efficient under the slogan of returning to the order from the beginnings of the empire.

As a proponent of peace with the Mongols, Zhang Juzheng rejected the proposal of Minister of War Tan Lun for a pre-emptive strike against them. Instead, he ordered Qi Jiguang, commander of the northeastern border, to maintain an armed peace. This decision not only allowed for a reduction in the border army, but also resulted in the return of surplus soldiers to their family farms. Zhang Juzheng not only rejected the notion that military affairs were less important than civilian ones, but also challenged the dominance of civilian dignitaries over military leaders. He appointed capable military leaders such as Qi Jiguang, Wang Chonggu (), Tan Lun, Liang Menglong (), and Li Chengliang to positions of responsibility. Additionally, he implemented a combination of defensive and offensive measures to strengthen border defenses and fostered peaceful relations with neighboring countries by opening border markets, particularly in the northwest.

Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s actions were within the bounds of existing legislation, but critics viewed them as an abuse of power to promote his followers and exert illegitimate pressure on officials. However, open criticism was rare until his father&#x27;s death in 1577. According to the law, Zhang was supposed to leave office due to mourning, but the emperor chose to keep him in office. This was not unprecedented, but criticism of disrespect for parents was widespread. Despite the fact that the most vocal critics were punished with beatings, Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s reputation was damaged. In an attempt to suppress opposition, Zhang then enforced an extraordinary self-evaluation of all high-ranking officials, resulting in the elimination of around fifty opponents.

Zhang Juzheng died on 9 July 1582. After his death, he was accused of the typical offenses of high officials, including bribery, living in luxury, promoting unqualified supporters, abusing power, and silencing critics. After Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s death, his followers among the officials were dismissed, and in the beginning of 1583, Feng Bao also lost his position. However, the emperor protected the officers, which boosted their morale to a level not seen since the mid-15th century. The Wanli Emperor&#x27;s more aggressive military policy was based on Zhang&#x27;s successes, as he attempted to replace static defense with more offensive tactics and appointed only officials with military experience to lead the Ministry of War. The emperor also shared Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s distrust of local and regional authorities and opposition to factional politics. Like Zhang Juzheng, the Wanli Emperor preferred to solve real problems rather than engage in &quot;empty talk&quot; and factional conflicts.

===Mid-reign (1582–1596)===

After Zhang&#x27;s death, a coalition formed between the emperor&#x27;s mother, the Grand Secretaries, the Ministry of Personnel, and the Censorate to ensure efficient administration of the empire. This alliance was opposed by the opposition, who deemed it illegal. However, with the absence of a strong statesman in the Grand Secretariat, there was no one to bring the administration under control. Both the emperor and opposition officials feared the concentration of power in the Grand Secretariat and worked to prevent it. From 1582 to 1591, the Grand Secretariat was briefly led by Zhang Siwei () and then for eight years by Shen Shixing. Shen Shixing attempted to find compromises between the monarch and the bureaucracy, while also tolerating criticism and respecting the decisions of ministries and the censors. However, his efforts to create a cooperative and cohesive atmosphere were unsuccessful. In 1590, the Grand Secretariat&#x27;s alliance with the leadership of the Ministry of Personnel and the Censorate fell apart, causing Shen Shixing to lose much of his influence. He was eventually forced to resign in 1591 due to his approach to the succession issue, which had lost him the confidence of opposition officials.

After 1582, the emperor chose the leaders of the Grand Secretariat from among the opponents of Zhang Juzheng (after Shen Shixing, the position was held by Wang Jiaping (), Wang Xijue, and Zhao Zhigao () until 1601). Except for the short-lived Wang Jiaping, all of Zhang&#x27;s successors—including Shen Yiguan (), Zhu Geng (), Li Tingji (), Ye Xianggao, and Fang Congzhe ()—fell out of favor and were either accused by censors during their lifetime or posthumously.

The anti-Zhang opposition, led by Gu Xiancheng, was successful in condemning him and purging his followers from the bureaucracy after his death. However, this also created an opportunity for the censors to criticize higher-ranking officials, which angered the monarch and caused dissatisfaction because the critics did not offer any positive solutions. As a result, Zhang&#x27;s opponents became embroiled in numerous disputes, hindering the restoration of a strong centralized government. From 1585, the censors also began to criticize the emperor&#x27;s private life. This criticism was fueled by the emperor&#x27;s reluctance to impose harsh punishments, which emboldened the critics. In response, the Wanli Emperor tried to silence their informers among his servants and gradually stopped responding to comments about himself. However, in 1588, the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s censors accused him of accepting a bribe from one of his eunuchs, which shocked the emperor and caused him to withdraw from cooperating with officials. He reduced his contact with them to a minimum and canceled the morning audience. He only appeared in public at celebrations of military victories and communication with the bureaucracy was done through written reports, to which he may or may not have responded. Towards the end of his reign, he also hindered personnel changes in offices, leaving positions vacant and allowing officials to leave without his written consent–which was illegal, but went unpunished. As a result, by 1603, nine positions of regional inspectors (out of 13) were vacant for a long time, and in 1604, almost half of the prefects and over half of the ministers and deputy ministers in both capitals were vacant. The emperor also deliberately left many positions vacant in the eunuch offices of the palace, particularly the position of head of the Directorate of Ceremonial, in an attempt to weaken communication between eunuchs and officials. This also resulted in significant financial savings from unoccupied seats.

The emperor&#x27;s lack of involvement in official positions did not affect the administration&#x27;s responsibility for tax collection. In times of military or other serious issues, he sought advice from responsible officials in Ministries and the Censorate, and was not hesitant to appoint capable individuals outside of the traditional hierarchy to handle the situation. However, he had a lack of trust in the regular administration and often found ways to bypass it. While he may have left some memoranda unanswered, he actively responded to others. Despite leaving some high positions vacant, the authorities were able to function under the guidance of deputies and the country&#x27;s administration continued to run smoothly. Assistance was provided to those affected by famine, rebellions were suppressed, border conflicts were resolved, and infrastructure was maintained.

Hundreds of memoranda arrived on the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s desk daily, but he only read and decided on a handful of them. The rest were handled by commissioned eunuchs, who were equipped with the imperial &quot;red brush&quot;. These eunuchs mostly confirmed the recommendations and proposals of the Grand Secretaries, but occasionally made different decisions if they believed the emperor would not agree with the Grand Secretaries&#x27; proposals.

Despite his desire to reform the civil service, the emperor was unable to do so, and he also did not want to simply confirm the decisions of the officials. Both sides—the emperor and the bureaucrats—wanted the other to behave properly, but their efforts were unsuccessful and only served to paralyze each other. As a result of these disputes at the center, the state&#x27;s control over the countryside weakened.

===Succession dispute (1586–1614)===
In 1586, the issue of succession arose when the emperor elevated his favorite concubine, Lady Zheng, to the rank of &quot;Imperial Noble Consort&quot; (&quot;Huang Guifei&quot;), placing her only one rank below the empress and above all other concubines, including Lady Wang, mother of the emperor&#x27;s eldest son Zhu Changluo (1582–1620). This made it clear to those around him that he favored the son of Lady Zheng, Zhu Changxun (1586–1641)—his third son (the second had died in infancy)—over Zhu Changluo as his successor. This caused a division among the bureaucracy; some officials defended the rights of the first son based on legal primogeniture, while others aligned themselves with Lady Zheng&#x27;s son. In response to the widespread support for the eldest son&#x27;s rights among officials, the emperor postponed his decision. He justified the delay by stating that he was waiting for a son from the empress. When asked to appoint Zhu Changluo as the crown prince at the age of eight so that his education could officially begin, the emperor again defended himself by saying that princes were traditionally taught by eunuchs.

In 1589, the emperor agreed to appoint Zhu Changluo as his successor. However, this decision was opposed by Lady Zheng, causing a wave of controversy and, two years later, even arrests when a pamphlet accusing her of conspiring with high officials against the emperor&#x27;s eldest son spread in Beijing. In an attempt to improve her public image, the emperor made efforts to portray Lady Zheng in a favorable light. This reached its peak in 1594 when he supported her efforts to aid the victims of a famine in Henan. He ordered all Beijing officials of the fifth rank and above to contribute to her cause from their incomes.

The failure to appoint a successor sparked frequent protests from both opposition-minded officials and high dignitaries, such as Grand Secretaries Shen Shixing (in office 1578–91) and Wang Xijue (in office 1584–91 and 1593–94). The rights of Zhu Changluo were also supported by the empress and the emperor&#x27;s mother. However, it was not until 1601, after facing pressure from another round of protests and requests, that the Wanli Emperor finally appointed Zhu Changluo as crown prince. At the same time, Zhu Changxun was given the title of Prince of Fu, but he was kept in Beijing instead of being sent to the province as originally planned when he turned eighteen in 1604. This fueled rumors that the question of succession was still unresolved. It was not until 1614, after numerous appeals and protests against inaction, that the emperor finally sent the prince to his provincial seat. This decision was only made after the emperor&#x27;s mother firmly advocated for it.

Related to the succession debates was the &quot;case of the attack with the stick&quot; (), which greatly damaged the ruler&#x27;s reputation. In late May 1615, a man with a stick was detained at the crown prince&#x27;s palace. From the subsequent investigation, it was discovered that the man, Zhang Chai (), was mentally unstable and had attempted to use his stick to settle a dispute with two eunuchs. Initially, it was decided that he would be executed to resolve the issue. However, Wang Zhicai (), a prison official, intervened and disputed the claim that Zhang Chai was insane. He pushed for a public investigation involving the Ministry of Justice. This new version of events suggested that Zhang Chai was actually of sound mind and had been invited into the palace by two eunuchs close to Lady Zheng and her brother. This raised suspicions that their true intention was to assassinate the crown prince and replace him with Lady Zheng&#x27;s son. This caused quite a stir at court. In response, the Wanli Emperor took the unprecedented step of summoning all civilian and military officials employed in Beijing and appearing before them with his family–the crown prince, his sons and daughter. He scolded the officials for doubting his relationship with the crown prince, whom he trusted and relied on. The crown prince himself confirmed their close relationship and requested an end to the matter. Ultimately, the emperor decided to execute Zhang Chai and the two eunuchs involved in the case. However, officials from the Ministry of Justice opposed the execution and demanded further investigation. A compromise was reached through the mediation of the Grand Secretaries—Zhang Chai was executed the following day, while the suspected eunuchs were to be interrogated. The interrogation did take place, but both eunuchs remained under the supervision of the emperor&#x27;s eunuchs. On the fifth day after the emperor&#x27;s speech, the officials were informed that the eunuchs had died. The case then quieted down.

===Mine Tax crisis (1596–1606)===

In August 1596, due to poor tax collection and the depletion of the treasury from the costly restoration of the Forbidden City palaces destroyed by fire in April of that year, the Wanli Emperor made the decision to accept proposals for silver mining that had been suggested by lower-level administrators for several years. He dispatched a team consisting of eunuchs, Imperial Guard officers, and representatives from the Ministry of Revenue to the outskirts of Beijing to establish new silver mines. He also sent an Imperial Guard officer to Henan province with the same task, and within a few weeks, other officers and eunuchs were sent to Shandong, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and Shanxi provinces. There was a long-standing tradition of sending eunuchs to various regions, as the business, trade, and mining industries provided opportunities for them to earn income. However, within a few days, this initiative was met with opposition from local authorities in Beijing, who raised concerns about the potential threat to imperial tombs in the mountains near Beijing and the difficulty of recruiting miners who were still engaged in illegal mining. In response, the emperor designated a protective zone for the tombs, but did not cancel the mining operation. He also appointed wealthy individuals from the local gentry to manage the mines and oversee necessary investments.

Confucian officials, who were concerned about the erosion of their authority, opposed the emperor&#x27;s initiative on ideological grounds, as they believed that the state should not engage in business and compete with the people for profit. They also objected to the emperor&#x27;s involvement in the mining industry, as it required the employment of miners who were considered untrustworthy and derogatorily referred to as &quot;mining bandits&quot;. Another reason for the gentry and officials opposition was the fact that eunuchs, a rival power group, were in charge of the mining operations. Furthermore, mining for silver was a complex task that required expertise and skills that the emperor&#x27;s eunuchs did not possess. To address this issue, the emperor appointed wealthy local individuals as mine managers, who were responsible for paying the mining tax and delivering the silver, regardless of the profitability of the mine. As a result, the mining of silver shifted from underground to the coffers of the wealthy, effectively taxing them. American historian Harry Miller bluntly described the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s actions as an &quot;economic war against the wealthy&quot;.

After the war in Korea reignited in 1597, the emperor made increased efforts to raise additional funds. Due to his lack of trust in the gentry, he began to establish an alternative eunuch regional administration. Gradually, the mining tax commissioners (&quot;kuangshi&quot;; ; literally &#x27;mining envoy&#x27;) gained control over the collection of trade and other taxes, in addition to the mining tax (&quot;kuangshui&quot;; ) which was officially approved by the emperor in 1598–1599. The emperor granted these commissioners the authority to supervise the county and prefectural authorities, and even the grand coordinators. As a result, the imperial commissioners no longer had to consider the opinions of local civil or military authorities. Instead, they could assign tasks to them and even imprison them if they resisted. While the emperor disregarded the protests of officials against the mining tax and the actions of the eunuchs, he closely monitored the reports and proposals of the eunuchs and responded promptly, often on the same day they arrived in Beijing. In 1599, he dispatched eunuchs to major ports, where they took over the powers of official civil administration. The emperor finally resolved disputes with officials defending their powers in the spring of 1599 by officially transferring the collection of taxes to mining commissioners. This expansion of eunuch powers and their operations earned the emperor a reputation among Confucian-oriented intellectuals as one of the most avaricious rulers in Chinese history, constantly seeking ways to fill his personal coffers at the expense of government revenue.

According to American historian Richard von Glahn, tax revenue from silver mines increased significantly from a few hundred kilograms per year before 1597 to an average of 3,650 kg per year in 1597–1606. In the most successful year of 1603, the revenue reached 6,650 kg, accounting for approximately 30% of mining. According to estimates by modern Chinese historians Wang Chunyu and Du Wanyan, the mining tax earned the state an additional 3 million &quot;liang&quot; (110 tons) of silver, with the eunuch commissioners retaining eight or nine times more. Another estimate suggests that in 1596–1606, the mine commissioners supplied the state with at least 5.96 million &quot;liang&quot; of silver, but kept 40–50 million for themselves. While officials commonly profited from their positions, eunuchs were known to pocket a significantly larger portion of the collected funds.

At the turn of the years 1605/1606, the emperor realized that not only gentry officials, but also eunuchs, were corrupt. He also recognized that the mining tax was causing more harm than good. As a result, in January 1606, he made the decision to abandon the attempt at alternative administration and issued an edict to abolish state mining operations. Tax collection was then returned to the traditional authorities. The gentry not only suffered financially from the eunuchs&#x27; actions, but also lost control over the financial transactions between the people and the state. This loss of control was a significant blow to their perceived dominance over the people. It was a humiliating experience and disrupted the natural order of things. However, by 1606, the gentry regained their dominance over both the people and the state as a whole.

===Reforms in the selection and evaluation of officials===
In the Ming administrative system, ultimate authority rested with the monarch. However, it required an energetic and competent ruler to effectively carry out this power. In cases where the ruler was not capable, the system of checks and balances resulted in collective leadership. This was due to the dispersion of power among various authorities. In the mid-15th century, a system of collective debates (&quot;huiguan tuiju&quot;; literally &#x27;to rally officials and to recommend collectively&#x27;) was established to address issues that were beyond the scope of one department. These gatherings involved dozens of officials discussing political and personnel matters. As a result, the importance of public opinion (&quot;gonglun&quot;; ) grew and the autocratic power of the monarch was limited.

During the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s reign, one of the issues that was resolved collectively was the appointment of high state dignitaries. At the beginning of his reign, Zhang Juzheng successfully abolished collective debates, giving the emperor the power to appoint high officials based on his own suggestions. However, after Zhang&#x27;s death, the debates were reinstated and the emperor&#x27;s power was once again limited. Despite this, Wanli attempted to overcome these restrictions, such as in 1591 when he announced his decision to appoint the current Minister of Rites, Zhao Zhigao, as Senior Grand Secretary without consulting with other officials. This decision was met with criticism from Minister of Personnel, Lu Guangzu, who argued that it violated proper procedure and undermined the fairness and credibility of the government&#x27;s decision-making processes. Lu and others believed that collective consideration of candidates in open public debate was a more impartial and fair method, as it eliminated individual bias and ignorance. In response to the criticism, the emperor partially retreated and promised to follow the proper procedure in the future. However, he continued to occasionally appoint high dignitaries without collective debate, which always sparked protests from officials.

In the late Ming period, there was a widespread belief that public opinion held more weight than individual opinions. This was evident in the way political and administrative issues were addressed, with decision-making being based on gathering information and opinions from officials through questionnaires and voting ballots. This also had an impact on the evaluation of officials, as their performance began to be judged not only by their superiors but also by the wider community. In 1595, Minister of Personnel Sun Piyang conducted a questionnaire survey on the conditions of several offices and used the results to persuade the Wanli Emperor to dismiss a certain official from Zhejiang. The survey had received a large number of negative comments, including accusations of corruption and other crimes. This unprecedented event sparked a heated debate, with Zhao Zhigao arguing that anonymous questionnaires should not be the main criteria for evaluation and that no one should be accused of criminal offenses based on unverified information from anonymous sources. Sun defended himself by stating that solid evidence against the individual was not necessary, as they were not being accused or standing trial. He believed that in evaluating officials, it was sufficient for him to impartially discover the widely held opinion of the individual&#x27;s recklessness through the survey.

The reform of civil servant evaluations resulted in their careers being dependent on their reputation, as determined by the ministry and censors through anonymous surveys filled out by their colleagues. This shift, along with collective debates, elevated the significance of public opinion during the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s reign, leading to intense public debates and conflicts as groups of officials vied for control of public opinion while the monarch&#x27;s authority and the weight of his voice declined.

===Donglin movement and factional disputes (1606–1620)===
In 1604, Gu Xiancheng, with the suggestion of his friend Gao Panlong (), established the Donglin Academy in Wuxi, located in Jiangnan. The academy served as a hub for discussions and meetings. With the support of local authorities and the gentry, the academy quickly gained prominence. As the founders had been out of politics for many years, the government did not view it as a threat. The academy attracted hundreds of intellectuals and soon became a significant intellectual center in all of China. It also inspired the creation of similar centers in nearby prefectures, forming a network of associations and circles.
According to the academy, they was a group of officials who advocated for strict adherence to Confucian morality. The supporters of the Donglin movement believed that living an exemplary life was essential for cultivating moral character, and they did not differentiate between private and public morality. They believed that one&#x27;s moral cultivation should begin with the mind/heart, then extend to one&#x27;s home, surroundings, and public life. This belief was exemplified by Gao Panlong. However, they viewed Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s decision to not mourn for his father as a sign of being an unprincipled profiteer. They also criticized the emperor for hesitating to confirm the succession of his eldest son, considering it unethical and unacceptable. The Donhlin movement promoted a system of government based on Confucian values, particularly the values of the patriarchal family, which were extended to the entire state. They believed that the local administration should be led by the educated gentry, who would guide the people. In this context, the technical aspects of governance were considered unimportant and any issues with the organization of administration were addressed by promoting Confucian virtues, preaching morality, and emphasizing self-sacrifice for higher goals. Disputes within the movement centered around moral values and qualities, with opponents being accused of immoral behavior rather than professional incompetence. The emphasis on morality allowed the Donglin movement to claim that they were not pursuing selfish goals, but were united by universal and true moral principles. Although the leaders of the movement did not return to office until the end of the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s reign, it had a significant influence among junior officials in Beijing.

They opposed the concentration of power in the Grand Secretariat and the Ministries, advocating for the independence of the Censorate. They also called for limitations on the activities of eunuchs within the imperial palace. Their stance on succession was based on principles, arguing that the ruler does not have the right to unilaterally change fundamental laws of the empire, including succession rules. However, their emphasis on decentralization and prioritizing morality and ideology over pragmatism hindered effective governance of the empire, which was already challenging due to its size and population.

The tendency to equate personal virtue with administrative talent led to morality becoming the main target in factional disputes. The regular evaluation of the capital officials was often used to eliminate opponents. In 1577, Zhang Juzheng used this type of evaluation for the first time, resulting in the removal of 51 of his opponents. Another evaluation in 1581 led to the dismissal of 264 officials in the capital and 67 in Nanjing, which was a significant purge considering that during the late Ming period, there were over a thousand officials serving in the central government in Beijing and almost four hundred in Nanjing. In 1587, only 31 &quot;jinshi&quot; were removed by Gand Secretary Shen Shixing, but none from the Ministry of Personnel, the Hanlin Academy, and the Censorate, where factional disputes were common. However, censors also demanded the dismissal of the Minister of Works He Qiming (), apparently for political reasons (as a supporter of Zhang Juzheng), just a month after his appointment, which angered the emperor. The minister was forced to leave, and the emperor also dismissed the head of the Censorate and transferred the responsible inspectors to the provinces. This sparked protests against &quot;the emperor&#x27;s interference in the independence of the Censorate&quot;.

In the 1593 evaluation, the Donglins utilized their positions in the Ministry of Personnel and the Censorate to eliminate the followers of the Grand Secretaries. The newly appointed Senior Grand Secretary, Wang Xijue, was unable to support his party members. He did, however, request the dismissal of several organizers of the purge during additional evaluations. The head of the Censorate opposed this, but the emperor ultimately agreed, sparking further protests from junior officials, including future founders of the Donglin Academy. By the time of the 1599 evaluation, the Donglin opposition had lost its influence, resulting in a more peaceful evaluation. However, in the 1605 evaluation, the Donglin movement once again attacked their opponents, and through Wen Chun (), the head of the Censorate, and Yang Shiqiao (), Vice Minister of Personnel, demanded the dismissal of 207 officials from the capital and 73 from Nanjing. However, the emperor did not agree to such a large-scale purge and explicitly stated that several of the accused officials should remain in their positions. This was an unprecedented refusal and sparked sharp criticism, leading to a months-long debate filled with mutual recriminations. Even Heaven seemed to intervene when lightning struck the Temple of Heaven. Eventually, the accused officials were forced to resign, but so were the organizers of the purge, including Grand Secretary Shen Yiguan, the following year. While the Donglins were successful in dismissing their opponents, they did not have suitable candidates for top positions. And even when a candidate like Li Sancai emerged, he was thwarted in the same way—through an attack on his moral integrity—in Li&#x27;s case, through bribery. This was also the first instance where a connection to the Donglin movement was used as an argument against a candidate.

In the 1611 evaluation, two anti-Donglin factions clashed, resulting in the downfall of their leaders (Tang Binyin (), Chancellor of Nanking University, and Gu Tianjun (), teacher of the heir apparent). The career of the highest-ranking Donglin sympathizer, Vice Minister of Personnel and Hanlin Academy scholar, Wang Tu (), was also ruined. In the 1617 evaluation, three cliques based on regional origin were in conflict, formed by anti-Donglin censors. In the last decade of the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s reign, the spineless bureaucrat Fang Congzhe led the Grand Secretariat, while the emperor left many high administrative positions vacant for long periods and simply ignored polemical memoranda.

The years 1570–1620 were relatively warm, especially in winter, with an average temperature one degree higher than the previous half century. However, the weather was also drier, leading to occasional flooding. This trend was particularly evident in the years 1585–1589 and 1614–1619, which experienced severe droughts. On the other hand, cold winters were recorded in 1595–1598 and 1616–1620, resulting in an increase in snowy landscapes depicted in Chinese paintings. In addition to these weather patterns, China also faced other natural disasters during this time period. In 1586, extensive flooding occurred, while locust raids destroyed crops in 1587, 1609, and 1615–1619, following periods of drought. Deforestation in the northwest also caused sandstorms, which covered Beijing in clouds of dust in 1618 and 1619. The most significant natural disaster during the Wanli era was the earthquake that struck China in December 1604. Its epicenter was located 30 km off the coast of Fujian, resulting in the destruction of the port cities of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, as well as damage to buildings in Moon Port. The effects of the earthquake were felt as far as Shanghai and inland areas such as Huguang and Guangxi. The worst individual disasters were the floods in the north in 1585 followed by a major epidemic the following year; a severe drought across the country in 1589; droughts in Fujian and the north in the second decade of the 17th century; and finally, widespread floods in 1613.

Overall, the most difficult years of the Wanli era were the periods 1586–88 and 1615–17. The drought-induced famine of 1587–88 was the first major famine since the mid-1540s, followed by an epidemic. According to the historian of demography Zhao Shuqi, half of the people in northern China died during this time, causing the population of Shanxi, Zhili, and Henan provinces to decrease from 25.6 million in 1580 to 12.8 million in 1588. The Yangtze Valley was also affected by these disasters. The disasters in the years 1586–88 shocked the government, however, the reserves accumulated by Zhang Juzheng helped overcome the difficulties. The authorities learned from this crisis and were able to intervene when the Henan famine broke out six years later, preventing it from spreading.

The second series of natural disasters began in 1615, preceded by two years of flooding in northern China. This combination of floods and drought greatly impacted agriculture, leading to regions across the country requesting assistance starting in the autumn of 1615. The situation was particularly dire in Shandong, where 900,000 people were starving and the civil administration was beginning to fall apart due to food shortages. The famine spread from northern China to the Yangtze River basin by the end of the year, and the following year it affected Guangdong. By the following year, the northwest and southwest regions of the Ming dynasty were also affected. The drought and floods continued until 1620.

In response to the famine, local authorities did not rely on state reserve granaries, which had mostly disappeared, but instead called on the wealthy to purchase and import grain. Officials only intervened by setting maximum prices. This meant that the state did not have to maintain a stockpile of grain when it could be purchased on the market. However, even in fertile years, regions such as Jiangnan still struggled due to their dependence on rice imports.

===New crops from America===
In the first third of the 16th century, Europeans brought new agricultural crops to China, including maize, sweet potatoes, and groundnuts. These crops were documented to have been cultivated in China during the second third of the 16th century. During the Wanli era, other originally American species such as tobacco and sweet potatoes were introduced and spread throughout the country.

Tobacco was commercially grown in Fujian and exported to the Philippines in the early 17th century, and cultivation began in Guangdong. Initially, tobacco was popular among the poor in Jiangnan, but eventually became a habit among the elite. By the beginning of the Qing period, it was reported that &quot;every official, soldier, and eight out of ten peasants&quot; in the region smoked. It was not until the 1630s that Beijing officials began to mention tobacco.

Sweet potatoes arrived in China in the early 1590s, possibly even earlier. They were brought by Chinese merchants from the Philippines to Fujian and Guangdong, and may have also been imported from Đại Việt. After a famine in Fujian in 1594, the local governor encouraged and promoted the cultivation of sweet potatoes. These crops quickly took hold in Fujian and Guangdong, and later spread to other regions of China in the second half of the 17th century.

===Economic developments===

During the Wanli era, there was a significant boom in industry, particularly in the production of silk, cotton, and porcelain. The textile industry in Shaanxi employed a large number of people, while Guangdong saw the emergence of large ironworks with thousands of workers. This period also saw the development of specialization in agricultural production and a significant increase in interregional trade. The impact of this development was most strongly felt in Jiangnan, where cities such as Suzhou, Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Nanjing flourished. Suzhou, known for its silk and financial industries, saw its population grow to over half a million by the end of the 16th century, while Songjiang became a center for cotton cultivation.

A significant portion of the production was exported in exchange for silver. Between 1560 and 1640, the Spanish colonies in the Americas shipped 1,000 tons of silver across the Pacific, with 900 tons ending up in China. However, during this same time period, Japan sent 6–7 times more silver to China. This influx of foreign silver coincided with the commercialization of the economy, which led to growth in industries such as cotton and silk, as well as the growth of cities and trade. However, this commercialization did not result in prosperity for all. Land and rice prices remained stagnant, and even fell in the 1570s and 1580s, before experiencing a sudden increase in 1587–89 due to famines in southern China. Additionally, wages and labor productivity in the Jiangnan cotton industry also declined. Contemporary commentators observed that while the market economy was thriving, state finances remained poor. Despite the luxurious lifestyle of urban elites, the majority of peasants and day laborers continued to live in poverty. These economic changes also brought about changes in values, particularly in regards to official Confucian doctrines.

During the 16th century, the Ming state gradually shifted towards the policy of &quot;zhaoshang maiban&quot; (; &#x27;the government purchase from private merchants&#x27;). For example, during the Jiajing era, the government began purchasing clothes for silver instead of relying on state textile factories in Suzhou and Hangzhou, which had since disappeared and been replaced by private factories. This marked the emergence of a market economy, where traders were no longer mere extensions of the state apparatus and were able to negotiate prices and contract volumes. State contracts also encouraged the growth of private enterprises, while the quality of production in state factories declined. For instance, in 1575, the army had to return 5,000 unusable shields. By the late 16th century, army officers were refusing to use goods produced by state workshops and instead demanded silver from the government to purchase equipment on the market. The government obtained the necessary silver by converting compulsory services into payments in the single bar reform. The aim of the reform was to eliminate levies in kind, services, and compulsory work in the &quot;lijia&quot; system and replace them with a surcharge to the land tax paid in silver. Transfers of various duties to silver payments had been taking place in various counties since the 1520s, with the most intense changes occurring in the 1570s to the 1590s. The reform was implemented by county authorities throughout the country. The changes proceeded from the more developed south of the country to the north, where the introduction of procedures common in the south caused a wave of resistance. Controversy centered primarily on the repeal of progressive household taxation: advocates of the reform argued that wealthy households usually received tax exemptions, making progressive taxation only fictitious. By the end of the 16th century, land tax surcharges had already replaced almost all benefits and labor performed in the &quot;lijia&quot; system.

In an effort to streamline the collection of land tax in 1581, Senior Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng advocated for the creation of a new cadastre. Over the course of 1581–1582, fields were measured, boundaries were marked, sizes were calculated, and owners and tenants were recorded. Cadastral maps were also compiled during this time. Due to Zhang&#x27;s untimely death, there was no final summary of data for the entire country. However, at the local level, the work served its purpose. Zhang&#x27;s cadastre served as the foundation for later Ming and Qing cadastres.

As early as 1581, the Ministry of Revenue had compiled the &quot;Wanli kuai ji lu&quot; (; &#x27;Record of the accounting procedures of the Wanli reign&#x27;), which provided an overview of taxes and fees throughout the empire. This document highlighted the complexity, diversity, and dependence on local conditions of these taxes, making unification a challenging task. After incorporating some compulsory works, the land tax amounted to 5–10% of the harvest, but in the four most heavily taxed prefectures of South Zhili, it reached 14–20%. In the 1570s–1590s, approximately 21 million &quot;liang&quot;s of silver were collected for the land tax, mostly in the form of grain.

===Trade===

Outside of Jiangnan, in most counties of Ming China, few products were traded across borders, with the most important being grain. Grain was primarily imported to Jiangnan from Jiangxi, Huguang, and western South Zhili, while North Zhili imported rice from Shandong and Beijing imported tax rice. The majority of rice on the market was collected by landlords from their tenants as rent. However, the grain market also facilitated the production of non-food goods, particularly textiles. In Jiangnan, there were areas that did not grow rice, but instead focused on textile crops such as cotton and mulberry. Mulberries were primarily grown in northern Zhejiang, with Huzhou being a central location. In and around Songjiang, cotton was grown on more than half of the land. The focus was not just on growing and producing goods, but also on selling them. In the late Ming period, the economy in Jiangnan shifted from cultivation to the processing of cotton, which was imported from Shandong, Henan, Fujian, and Guangdong. Suzhou and Hangzhou were known as centers for the production of luxury goods, while ordinary fabrics were produced in the surrounding areas. Within the production process, there was specialization in individual stages, such as spinning and weaving.

Of the various regional merchant groups, those from Shanxi dominated the salt trade in the interior, including Sichuan. Meanwhile, merchants from Huizhou controlled long-distance trade on the Grand Canal and were the most influential wholesalers and retailers in Jiangnan. They were followed by merchants from Suzhou, Fujian, and Guangzhou, in that order. Merchants from Jiangxi operated on a smaller scale, mainly in Henan, Huguang, and Sichuan. Local agents offered boats, crew, and porters for hire on trade routes. Travel guides were published, providing information on routes, distances, inns, famous places, ferries, and safety. Commercial intermediaries allowed for the sending of money through drafts.

Women entrepreneurs emerged, selling various goods, and also acted as intermediaries in legal disputes. Conservatives viewed women&#x27;s involvement in trade with disdain, as seen in the case of Li Le, who praised a prefect for &quot;banning gambling and women from selling at markets&quot; in the Jiaxing prefecture.

===Silver===
The growth of silver imports in the first third of the 16th century led to an increase in its use. By the second half of the 16th century, Ming statesmen were already concerned that silver would completely replace bronze coins. In the last third of the 16th century, the issue of the relationship between silver and coins became a central topic in discussions about monetary policy. Some officials suggested halting the production of coins due to their lack of profitability, while their opponents argued that this was a short-sighted policy that ignored the long-term benefits of increasing circulation. This allowed silver to become the dominant currency. In the 1570s and 1580s, debates about currency were dominated by concerns about silver shortages causing deflation, but these debates died down in the 1590s.

The import of silver had a significant impact on the Ming economy. Its price relative to gold and copper fell by half during the Wan-li era, but its purchasing power was still greater compared to the rest of the world. The Ministry of Revenue&#x27;s silver income doubled during the 1570s alone, from about 90 tons to approximately 165 tons per year. The income of local authorities also increased, such as in the Moon Port, the main center of foreign maritime trade, where trade licenses and customs fees grew from 113 kg of silver to over one ton between 1570 and 1594. However, the influx of silver also led to the export of gold and coins. This influx of silver also had negative effects, as inflation appeared in regions with a surplus of silver in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, such as the southeast coast, Jiangnan, and the Grand Canal.

===Coinage===

Silver was distrusted by many officials because they feared dependence on its inflow from abroad and did not trust its ability to provide all the functions of money. As a result, they attempted to revive the use of coins. In 1571–1572, the mints were briefly opened, but Zhang Juzheng reopened them in 1576. He restored the mints in Beijing and Nanjing, and later in Yunnan. Additionally, he opened mints in both the northern provinces where coins were commonly used—Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan—as well as in provinces where they were not commonly used—Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Huguang. While the mints in the metropolitan areas were state-owned, those in the provinces were run by licensed entrepreneurs. However, the production of coins faced immediate challenges such as a shortage of copper and difficulties in hiring qualified personnel. In Jiangxi, for example, the mint was only able to produce 5% of the planned amount of coins. In response, the authorities decreed that at least 70% of tax payments must be made in new coins and encouraged merchants to import coins from surrounding provinces. However, merchants often supplied low-quality privately produced coins, which were illegal. Similarly, the introduction of coins failed in Fujian, where silver was already widely used. Zhang&#x27;s monetary policy was fragmented, with each province&#x27;s officials making their own decisions on supporting coinage. This led to various issues, such as a revolt in Hangzhou in 1582 when soldiers&#x27; salaries were converted into coins in Zhejiang, and the banning of private exchange offices in Jiangxi, which hindered the circulation of new coins. Some provinces also prohibited the export of coins from their territory, while others prohibited coins cast outside their territory. Attempts to introduce new coins into circulation by selling them at a discount only benefited money changers who bought cheap coins from the authorities and resold them at the normal market price. In some cases, attempts to ban the use of illegal private coins resulted in violent protests and the lifting of the bans. While coins cast in Beijing were accepted by the market, low-quality private coins continued to dominate in the south. In 1579, Zhang admitted that the attempt to introduce coins had failed. He closed the Yunnan mint the following year and most of the other provincial mints in 1582. However, three mints in Huguang continued to operate, casting different coins and leading to the division of the province into several mint zones. After Zhang&#x27;s death, his successors and opponents closed most of the mints due to inefficiency. Zhang&#x27;s opponents argued that the state should not interfere in market and currency affairs and impose a currency that the people did not want. On the other hand, some argued that while silver served as a capital and store of value, coins were essential as a medium of exchange and their production, even if unprofitable, would lead to economic recovery in the long run.

In 1599, the Wanli Emperor returned to an expansive monetary policy. The production of new coins was concentrated in Nanjing, where the capacity of mints increased tenfold. However, the circulation of these coins was limited to the immediate vicinity of Nanjing. As a result, there was a surplus of coins in the city, causing their value to decrease from 850 to 1300 per &quot;liang&quot; of silver. However, in 1606, floods disrupted the import of metals, causing the price of copper to rise. In response, the state limited coin production and laid off 3,000 workers from the mints. These workers then used their knowledge to produce illegal coins. As a result, private coins began to replace national coins within a few years. The government responded by banning the use of private coins, but this caused money changers to stop accepting any coins as a precaution. Nanjing merchants followed suit, leading to riots among the people. This was especially problematic for day laborers and workers who were paid in coins and relied on merchants accepting them for their daily needs. The use of less valuable private coins became more beneficial for their day-to-day transactions.

==Culture and society==
===Philosophy===

Wang Yangming rejected the idea of Confucianism as a fixed belief, stating that &quot;The Way is not the private property of Confucius.&quot; He emphasized the importance of self-awareness and self-knowledge over strict adherence to doctrine. In general, he shifted the focus of Confucianism from following the teachings of past sages to following one&#x27;s own heart. However, in the 1570s, Zhang Juzheng emerged as a strong opponent of Wang&#x27;s followers, offering an alternative perspective. Zhang emphasized the pragmatic pursuit of state interests, in contrast to the emphasis on personal improvement within Wang&#x27;s teachings. He believed that actions that benefited the state and its people were the correct ones, stating &quot;If it is to the benefit of the state, I would do it regardless of life or death&quot;. Zhang justified his actions against those who were preoccupied with moral debates and self-reflection, viewing them as irresponsible and unproductive. He did not see them as moral role models, but rather as lazy individuals.

After the death of Zhang Juzheng in 1584, three Ming philosophers, Hu Juren (), Chen Xianzhang, and Wang Yangming, were given exceptional official recognition. They were among the supporters of private Confucian academies whose tablets were placed in the Temple of Confucius. Wang Yangming&#x27;s followers, particularly Wang Gen and his students, known as the Taizhou School, were the most radical in their rejection of Zhuist orthodoxy. In the late 16th century, Li Zhi accused the conformists in authority of hypocrisy, prioritizing their own benefit and career over correctness. He also questioned the infallibility of the classics and defended the legitimacy of human desires. Li Zhi believed that pursuing self-interest was good, as it motivated peasants, artisans, and scholars to perform their professions to the best of their abilities. This led to the spread of values such as materialism, pragmatism, and utilitarianism, and the judging of people not by their occupation but by their wealth. As a result, the social status of poor scholars was no longer higher than that of rich merchants. The enthusiasm for Wang Yangming&#x27;s subjectivism reached its peak at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, when individual experience was valued above traditional patterns. These attitudes later influenced the criticality and empiricism of the Qing Confucians.

In the late 16th century, there was a growing trend towards syncretism, which seemed to stem from a dissatisfaction with traditional Confucian beliefs. Lin Zhao&#x27;en (), known as the &quot;Master of the Three Teachings&quot;, sought to connect Confucianism with Buddhism and Taoism, particularly in regards to Taoist healing practices. Along with his studies in Confucianism, Hu Zhi also delved into Buddhism and Taoism, practicing meditation and ultimately achieving enlightenment. From a Buddhist perspective, this was seen as a &quot;revelation of Buddha-Nature&quot;, while Confucians viewed it as a &quot;discovery of the heart/mind through innate knowledge&quot;.

In 1603, Gu Xiancheng, upon the suggestion of his friend Gao Panlong, revived the Donglin Academy as a hub for discussions on Confucianism. This initiative attracted hundreds of educated individuals who engaged in regular debates, quickly establishing the academy as a prominent intellectual center on a national level. The Donglins rejected the Buddhist and Taoist practice of seclusion, instead advocating for active participation in public life. The academy&#x27;s leaders aimed for a moral revival to improve the political climate of the country. They opposed the devotion to intuition promoted by Wang&#x27;s follower Wang Ji and the Taizhou School, instead emphasizing disciplined effort and action. Following Zhu Xi&#x27;s model, they divided their studies between reading books and meditation, which they did not associate with Chan Buddhist, but rather derived from Confucian ritualism.

===Calligraphy and painting===

In his theoretical works, Dong Qichang (1555–1636) from Songjiang, a renowned scholar who excelled in literary composition, painting, and calligraphy from a young age, best expressed the aesthetic rules of the Imperial Painting Academy. While he was primarily known as a theoretician of painting, he also wrote about the history of calligraphy. Dong emphasized the importance of painting as a form of calligraphic expression and encouraged artists to study the techniques of past masters. In order to validate his own artistic abilities, he argued that throughout history, painters were divided into two distinct schools: the ink painting of the Southern School, which strove to express the inner essence of the subject, and the descriptive, decorative tradition of professional &quot;craftsman&quot; painters of the Northern School. He himself positioned himself at the end of the development of the Southern School as the true heir of literati painting, seeking to express the thoughts of the creator rather than seeking material gain. His monumental ink landscapes became the standard for traditional painting, and it was not until the 20th century that the concept of the Northern and Southern Schools was reevaluated. One of the notable painters of the Wanli era was Wu Bin, who worked in Nanjing and later at the Beijing court. He was known for his eccentric style, influenced by the local Fujian tradition and elements of the Wu School, which gave his paintings a sense of elegance and beauty. However, he also incorporated expressive techniques from the Zhe School.

Dong Qichang was a dominant figure in the theory and practice of late Ming calligraphy. In his works on calligraphy, he placed the masters of his Songjiang region above those of Suzhou. He stressed the importance of studying calligraphy from the Eastern Jin (4th century) and Tang (7th–9th century) periods, specifically highlighting the works of Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi. However, he did not advocate for direct imitation of their styles, but rather a thorough analysis of their techniques. Other notable calligraphers from the second half of the 16th century in Songjiang included Dong Qichang&#x27;s friend Chen Jiru, a versatile artist and collector, and Xu Wei, a predecessor of individual Qing dynasty artists, known for his &quot;flowers and birds&quot; genre paintings and his &quot;crazy conceptual calligraphy&quot; style, which was similar to abstract painting.

===Poetry===
In the 1570s and 1580s, Wang Shizhen () held the esteemed position of literary arbiter and most respected critic of Ming China. He was a versatile artist and the leading figure among the Later Seven Masters of the Ming. In the following generation, at the beginning of the 17th century, poets focused on expressing their own nature, individual creativity, and emotions. Their thinking was influenced by the individualistic philosophy of Li Zhi. Prominent figures of this era included Tang Xianzu, a poet, essayist, calligrapher, dramatist, and literary theorist; Xu Wei, a poet, essayist, calligrapher, painter, and dramatist; and Tu Long, a poet, critic, dramatist, art collector, and connoisseur. One of the most notable poets of the Wanli era was Hu Yinglin, who came from a wealthy family but chose to pursue literature instead of a career in the civil service after failing the examinations. Although his poems were not particularly significant, he compiled an encyclopedia of poetics called &quot;Shisou&quot; (Thickets of criticism). In this work, he provided a structured overview of poetic forms, history, and sources from the perspective of the archaizing movement. This movement viewed Tang poetry as the pinnacle of poetic achievement, but also recognized its revival during the Yuan period and the contributions of the seven earlier and seven later masters in the 16th century.

The poets of the Gong&#x27;an School, particularly the Yuan brothers—Yuan Hongdao, Yuan Zongdao (), and Yuan Zhongdao—held distinct positions. Li Zhi had a direct influence on the Yuan brothers and their Gong&#x27;an school, shaping their rejection of traditional authorities, avoidance of imitation (which they believed stifled creativity), pursuit of natural expression, and advocacy for drama and fiction as legitimate literary forms. However, the poetry of the three brothers was largely conventional; they differed from previous generations (Earlier Seven Masters and Later Seven Masters of the Ming) by imitating middle Tang (especially Bai Juyi) and Song (Su Shi) poetry rather than the pinnacle of Tang poetry. In this, they followed Wang Shizhen, who also looked to middle Tang and Song poets as role models. More than their poetry, the brothers&#x27; criticism was widely read and their conclusions had gained general recognition by the mid-17th century.The brothers were also active in literary associations, blending Confucianism with Buddhism and Taoism, and exploring various prose and encyclopedic disciplines such as floristry and pharmacopoeia. Yuan Hongdao was a proponent of literature written in colloquial language, arguing that it too was capable of conveying moral truths. Literary connections were not limited to the educated gentry, but also extended to professional painters, writers, and calligraphers, as well as art-loving merchants, talented women, and courtesans. This diverse cultural scene became a significant aspect of Ming literature in the following generation.

During the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, another literary movement emerged known as the Jingling School, led by Tan Yuanchun and Zhong Xing. While they shared the belief of the Gong&#x27;an school that poetry should express &quot;natural feelings&quot;, they criticized the imitation of Bai Juyi and Su Shi as producing &quot;vulgar and crude&quot; poetry. Instead, they focused on cultivating their own style, striving to capture the depth and scale of their favorite pre-Tang and Tang works, but often falling into the trap of imitation. Their most notable contributions were the anthologies &quot;Return to Old poetry&quot; (; &quot;Gushi gui&quot;) and &quot;Return to Tang poetry&quot; (; &quot;Tangshi gui&quot;), published in 1614 and 1617 respectively, in which they expressed their views on poetic creation. The success of these anthologies was further enhanced by the contributions of Min Qiji (), who distinguished the poems in color from the editors&#x27; notes and comments for the convenience of readers.

===Literature and drama===

In 1566, Tan Kai, a retired official and bibliophile, published &quot;Extensive Records of the Taiping Reign&quot; (&quot;Taiping guangji&quot;), a collection of seven thousand mostly supernatural stories from the early Song dynasty. This collection revived many Tang and older stories and tales. During this time, writers edited and published both old and new stories, as well as short story collections. Some notable examples include Wang Tonggui&#x27;s &quot;Tales Overheard&quot; (&quot;Ertan&quot;, 1597), Su Changzuo&#x27;s &quot;Complete Records of Yanshan&quot; (&quot;Yanshan conglu&quot;, 1602), and Qian Xiyan&#x27;s &quot;Garden of Cleverness&quot; (&quot;Kaiyuan&quot;, 1613), which gained great popularity. Short stories in the classical language were written by Song Maocheng and Pan Zhiheng, while Ling Mengchu and Feng Menglong wrote in the colloquial language. Around 1590, the genre of novels in colloquial language, which was rare at the time, began to flourish. Two notable novels from the Wanli era were &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, one of the Four Classic Chinese Novels, and the socio-critical &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot;. Additionally, Luo Maodeng&#x27;s 1597 novel &quot;The Eunuch Sanbao&#x27;s Voyage to the Western Ocean&quot; (&quot;Sanbao taijian xiyang ji&quot;) was the first work to impress readers with the size of Zheng He&#x27;s &quot;treasure ships&quot;.

The development of drama was greatly influenced by Liang Chenyu, who incorporated the Kunshan style of music, known as &quot;Kunqu&quot;, into his drama &quot;Washing Silken Gauze&quot; (; &quot;Huan Sha Ji&quot;). This combination of &quot;Kunqu&quot; music and &quot;Chuanqi&quot; dramatic form was a huge success, leading to the merging of the two concepts. As a result, in the following decades, numerous authors and plays emerged. The most prestigious position in the theater world was held by private theater troupes, who were employed by the wealthy for their own entertainment and that of their guests. Among the playwrights, Tang Xianzu was particularly notable for his &quot;four dream plays&quot;, with his work &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot; being highly regarded. Another important playwright of the Wanli era was Zheng Zhizhen, who adapted the popular story &quot;Mulian Rescues His Mother&quot; (&quot;Mulian jiu mu xing xiao xi wen&quot;) into a theatrical form. Of Shen Jing&#x27;s dramas, only the play &quot;The Noble Knight-Errant&quot; (&quot;Yixia ji&quot;; an adaptation of one of the chapters of &quot;Water Margin&quot;) succeeded, yet he became an important theoretician. His followers are known as the Wujiang School. In theory, he emphasized the role of music, which he considered more important than the textual component of the play (the opposite opinion was defended by Tang Xianzu). Zang Maoxun compiled the &quot;Anthology of Yuan Plays&quot; (&quot;Yuanqu xuan&quot;), which became the basic source of Yuan &quot;zaju&quot; dramas for four centuries, however, the plays in it do not have an original form, but were significantly modified by Zang in accordance with late Ming values and artistic attitudes 

===Books, the book market, and newspapers===
In the early 16th century, printed literature prevailed over manuscript literature, leading to an explosive expansion of written texts. Compared to Europe, paper was cheap in China and woodblock printing did not require a large initial investment, allowing for the rapid spread of printed literature of various kinds and genres. This abundance of books was noted by Europeans such as Matteo Ricci during the Wanli era, who marveled at the wealth of literary resources in China. While books were generally affordable, rare prints could still be quite expensive, costing up to a hundred &quot;liang&quot;s of silver. The widespread availability of books also led to an increase in leisure reading, as people were not only reading for work, but also for pleasure. According to European visitors, literacy was widespread in China, with even the poorest families having access to education and the ability to read and write. This resulted in a larger number of people reading books in China and around the world than ever before.

The book market grew exponentially. In the first third of the 16th century, the market was relatively limited and focused mainly on Confucian classics, official histories, and neo-Confucian philosophers. These books were printed in princely palaces, offices, and commercially, with a particular concentration in Fujian, specifically in Jianning Prefecture in the northern part of the province. However, in the Wanli era, commercial publishers began printing a wide range of literature in hopes of making a profit. This included not only the aforementioned official literature, but also various genres of fiction, encyclopedias, and manuals of all kinds. These ranged from &quot;pocket classics&quot; for students to guides on how to become a writer or lead the country. The market was also flooded with manuals and encyclopedias on household management. By the end of the century, fiction had become extremely popular. The affordability of printing allowed for the distribution of specialized books, such as medical texts, which had previously only been available in manuscript form.

The most significant regions for book production were Suzhou, Fujian, and Zhejiang. Suzhou was known for printing the highest quality and most expensive books, while Fujian produced the largest quantity at the lowest cost. Zhejiang ranked second in both aspects. The growth and commercialization of the book market encouraged academics to publish their own work, a departure from the previous practice of having their students or descendants publish for them. Esteemed scholars could rely on publishers to pay them in advance for their writing, with the expectation of making a profit. This led to the emergence of scholars who focused solely on writing and publishing.

Private libraries were growing in size. During the Song dynasty, it was rare for someone to have a library with ten thousand &quot;juan&quot;. However, during the Wanli era, private libraries in Jiangnan had 30,000 to 50,000 &quot;juan&quot;. Some scholars, like Ge Jian from Yangzhou, even had 10,000 titles in their personal collections (with each title possibly costing several tens of &quot;juan&quot;). There were dozens of these extensive private libraries in existence. Due to their size, many of these large private libraries were housed in separate buildings. For example, the famous bibliophile Mao Kun&#x27;s library had twelve rooms. These impressive private libraries were a source of amazement for Europeans.

Private newspapers also began to emerge during this time. Initially, they mainly republished material from the official gazette, but eventually they started to produce their own news. As early as the 1590s, former minister Yu Shenxing () expressed concern that newspaper publishers were exaggerating the failures of the fighting on the northern border, causing unnecessary panic among the population. He criticized their focus on sensational news for the sake of marketability and profit, rather than reporting on truly important events.

===Imperial examinations===

Only individuals with official status were able to ensure the preservation of a merchant family&#x27;s wealth. As a result, merchants often encouraged their sons to pursue education and obtain an official rank. However, during the first two centuries of the Ming dynasty, only candidates from families of officials, peasants (or landowners), craftsmen, and soldiers were allowed to take the civil service examinations. Merchants were not permitted to participate. In the Wanli era, merchants were finally allowed to participate in the imperial examinations. However, only one candidate, a certain Zheng Maohua in 1607, was able to pass the highest level of the exams, known as the palace examinations, and obtain the &quot;jinshi&quot; rank. Despite this, merchants still managed to pass the examinations by registering under the names of others or posing as peasants or soldiers from a different location. As a result, in the late Ming period, the majority of successful examination candidates came from merchant families.

In the students&#x27; environment, the eight-legged essay was an important genre, and mastery of it was crucial for success in examinations. This literary form emerged in the Wanli era and gained popularity over the course of a century. It was not yet rigid and was seen as a challenge for intellectuals to showcase their stylistic dexterity. Esteemed art critics like Li Zhi and Yuan Hongdao valued this genre for its experimental and innovative nature. However, mastering the eight-legged essay required more than just individual study. The preferences and styles favored by examiners were constantly changing, giving an advantage to candidates from larger cities who could keep up with these trends. This is why it was beneficial to be part of literary societies. In the 1570s, these societies began publishing successful essays with commentary and criticism. Additionally, collections of model essays were published by the authorities starting in 1587.

The study was costly; for example, Wang Shizhen () spent 300 &quot;liang&quot; (11.2 kg) of silver per year on his studies. Even the poorest candidates had to cover at least a third of the cost, often resulting in debt. After being appointed to office, officials had to use their salaries to pay off creditors, who were often wealthy merchants. However, official salaries were not high, with county heads only earning 87 &quot;liang&quot; per year in the 16th century. As a result, most officials relied on the revenues from their office, and any significant increase in wealth was considered corrupt.

In 1583, the government tightened control over provincial examinations by selecting chief examiners and their deputies from members of the Hanlin Academy. Previously, these positions were held by teachers in charge of county and prefectural state schools, who typically only passed the provincial examinations.

===Clothing===
In the early Ming period, the style, materials, and color of clothing were determined by the state. As early as 1541, the Ministry of Rites prohibited inappropriate styles of dress. However, by the 1560s, these prohibitions were no longer being enforced and people began to dress according to ever-changing fashion trends. The city of Suzhou became the center of fashion and set the trends for the rest of the country. This distinction between appropriate and inappropriate extended beyond clothing to items of daily use and household equipment. The arbiters of taste and elegance condemned the ostentatious display of wealth, such as the use of gold utensils and dishes, as vulgar behavior of the uneducated wealthy. This behavior was becoming more common due to the influx of silver from abroad, which led to the enrichment of merchants who surpassed landowners in terms of wealth and extravagant spending. These &quot;nouveau riche&quot; individuals sought social recognition, but the traditional elites fought back and tried to maintain their upper hand. One of their tactics was the institution of fashion. In the last decade of the Wanli era, the fear of the wealth and influence of the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; reached its peak. On the other hand, from the 1590s onwards, writers from the gentry class produced manuals instructing the ignorant on what objects and antiques were appropriate to own and how to properly dispose of them in accordance with cultural norms. However, the counterfeiting of antiquities and valuables also became widespread.

Fashion was also intertwined with sexual relations, as educated and cultured courtesans like Xue Susu and Ma Shouzhen emerged, breaking free from the traditional role of women being limited to the household. A trend for sexual relations with boys also emerged among the elite, openly defying Confucian norms.

==Military and foreign policy==
===Restoration of Ming military power in the last third of the 16th century===

The largest military campaigns of the Wanli era were known as the &quot;Three Great Campaigns of the Wanli Era&quot;. The first of these was the suppression of the rebellion in Ningxia, followed by the Imjin War with Japan in Korea and the suppression of the Yang Yinglong rebellion in Bozhou. These campaigns involved the mobilization of tens and hundreds of thousands of troops, as well as their movement and long-distance supply. The success of the Ming dynasty in these campaigns can be attributed to the overall increase in China&#x27;s military power during the 1570s to the first decade of the seventeenth century. During this time, the Ming dynasty was aggressively expanding along all frontiers, including launching raids into the Mongolian steppes and supporting the colonization of Han borderlands. In addition to these three major campaigns, the Ming troops also suppressed several rebellions within the empire and successfully expanded and secured the borders in the southwest through battles with the Burmese. This allowed for the colonization of previously indigenous territories in the southwest and northwest. The Ming dynasty also actively interfered in the affairs of the Jurchens in the northeast.

Following the example of his teacher Zhang Juzheng, the Wanli Emperor placed great emphasis on military affairs. This was one of the few areas where most civil officials felt insecure, giving the emperor the ability to enforce his will. In order to bypass the usual bureaucratic procedures, Wanli relied on successful generals. In the emperor&#x27;s eyes, generals were more dependable and trustworthy than officials, as they spent most of their time in the field and did not have the opportunity to build networks of support in the capital. Additionally, the Wanli Emperor saw generals as representatives of a different lifestyle, one that was more free and unartistic. He took great care in selecting capable generals and was not afraid to give them extraordinary powers, allowing them to make quick decisions without waiting for his approval. This contributed greatly to the success of their campaigns. The Wanli Emperor was also willing to allocate significant funds from his reserves to supply and equip the troops, and he entrusted the generals with powers and responsibilities that were typically reserved for civil officials, despite objections from the government.
On the northern border, the Wanli Emperor aimed to replace static defense with more aggressive tactics. In his own words,
He generally preferred a decisive rather than aggressive approach towards domestic rebels and foreign enemies. Under the leadership of capable generals, the Ming army was the strongest it had been since the reign of the Yongle Emperor (1402–1424). Contemporary estimates put the number of Ming soldiers in the 1570s at 845,000. By the beginning of the 17th century, the Ming dynasty had over 4 million men in arms. Training centers were established near Beijing, where units preparing for Korea also trained. Instead of relying on the inefficient and incompetent hereditary soldiers of the &quot;Weisuo&quot; system, the Ming government turned to hiring mercenaries who were better trained, more disciplined, and more cost-effective in battle. Troops from militant minority nations were also utilized, particularly &quot;wolf troops&quot; (&quot;lang bing&quot;) from Guangxi. The development of the military was supported by a number of manuals and handbooks. The most extensive surviving works on military affairs are the &quot;Chouhai tubian&quot; (Gazeteer of Coastal Defense) by Zheng Ruozeng in 1562, the &quot;Shenqi pu&quot; (Treatise on Firearms) by Zhao Shizhen in 1598, and the &quot;Wubei Zhi&quot; (Encyclopedia of Military Preparedness) by Mao Yuanyi in 1601. In his manuals &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot; and &quot;Lianbing Shiji&quot;, General Qi Jiguang provided detailed tactics for using small groups of soldiers, discussed psychological warfare, analyzed the composition, tasks, and training of units, and outlined the use of weapons and procedures based on terrain and soldier experience. He emphasized the importance of morale and training for soldiers.

Towards the end of his reign, the emperor closely monitored military threats on the borders. In 1619, shortly before his death, he allocated funds for an expedition against the Jurchens in Liaodong. However, the campaign ended in a disastrous defeat for the Ming army. The emperor then protected the surviving generals, including Li Rubai, from government attempts to execute them.

===Rebellion in Ningxia===

In March 1592, a rebellion broke out in Ningxia, an important fortress city on the northwestern frontier. Led by Chinese officer Liu Dongyang, the soldiers of the garrison revolted. The rebellion was also joined by Pubei, a Mongol and deputy regional commander who had three thousand horsemen in his personal guard. Due to his origin, the rebellion was attributed to him. The rebels successfully took control of Ningxia and nearly fifty nearby fortresses. They demanded recognition from the government, threatening to ally with the Ordos Mongols. At the time, Ningxia had a population of 300,000 and a garrison of 30,000 (or 20,000) soldiers. The city walls were six meters thick and nine meters high, making it a formidable stronghold. The rebels were experienced soldiers.

On 19 April, the emperor was informed of the uprising and immediately summoned Minister of War, Shi Xing (). Following the minister&#x27;s proposal, he ordered the mobilization of 7,000 soldiers from Xuanhua and Shanxi. Wei Xueceng, an experienced military official and commander-in-chief of the three border regions (Xuanfu, Shanxi, and Datong), was entrusted with the task of suppressing the rebellion. The emperor provided him with a number of officers and officials, including General Ma Gui. Wei Xueceng successfully secured the southern bank of the Yellow River, captured key forts, and within weeks recaptured nearby frontier forts, leaving only the city of Ningxia under rebel control. However, he then declared that he did not have enough men and equipment and took a passive stance. Despite the reinforcements provided, he insisted on negotiating with the insurgents, citing concerns for the lives of civilians in Ningxia. The emperor discussed the situation with the Gand Secretaries, as well as the censors and the ministers, and ultimately took a decisive position to suppress the rebellion as quickly as possible. For the next six weeks, Ming troops besieged Ningxia, occasionally facing resistance from the Mongols. In the fourth month of the year, the Ming launched an attack on the city and managed to eliminate about 3,000 defenders. However, their attempt to penetrate the city through the northern gate failed and resulted in heavy losses.

In an effort to conduct the siege operations more effectively, the emperor appointed General Li Rusong as the military superintendent in charge of suppressing the rebellion. This appointment was met with shock by the bureaucracy in the capital, as the position and overall command were traditionally held by civilian officials rather than professional officers. In July, Ming reinforcements arrived at Ningxia and skirmishes between the besiegers and the rebels continued. At the end of July, Li Rusong also arrived and began attacking the city day and night in early August. The rebels were only able to repel them with difficulty. Meanwhile, the Japanese were successfully occupying Korea, prompting the emperor to urge a swift resolution of the situation. In late August, Wei Xueceng was arrested for his reluctance and taken to Beijing. The emperor then approved Shi Xing&#x27;s plan to build ramparts around the city and fill the interior, including the city itself, with water.

On 23 August, a 5.3 km long dam surrounded Ningxia. The rebels gained the alliance of Mongol chief Bushugtu, but Li Rusong sent Ma Gui and General Dong Yiyuan with part of the army to attack them and occupy the passes east of the city. Ma and Dong successfully repulsed the Mongols. By 6 September, the city was already flooded with almost three meters of water, causing the rebels&#x27; attacks to fail and the besieged to suffer from a critical shortage of food. The city&#x27;s inhabitants and Ma Gui pleaded with the insurgents to surrender in order to save human lives. However, the rebels continued to launch unsuccessful raids while also facing attacks from Ming troops. By the end of September, the 18,000-strong Mongolian army was blocked north of the city. Li Rusong and Ma Gui led a counterattack and drove the Mongols back. As the water breached the walls, the city was eventually taken in mid-October. Pubei committed suicide, while several other rebel leaders were captured and executed. The emperor then sent a large portion of the troops from Ningxia, led by Li Rusong, to Korea.

===Korea and Japan: The Imjin War===
In the early 1590s, Japanese warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi had successfully unified Japan under his rule. However, his ambitions extended beyond just ruling over his own country. In challenges sent to the rulers of neighboring countries, he declared his intention to dominate East Asia and establish his rule from the Chinese port of Ningbo. His first target was Korea, with the ultimate goal of conquering Ming China. The Chinese were well aware of the Japanese threat to their hegemony in East Asia and responded with vigor.

In May 1592, Japanese troops landed in Korea. Due to the Korean army&#x27;s lack of preparation, they were unable to put up much resistance and the Japanese quickly advanced, taking control of Seoul in just twenty days and continuing further north. The Korean king fled north to the Korean-Ming border on the Yalu River. In response, the Koreans sought help from Ming China. The Wanli Emperor decidedly took an anti-Japanese stance and only sent a small scouting force of three thousand soldiers. This force was ultimately surprised and destroyed by the Japanese in Pyongyang in August 1592. This event shocked the Beijing court and they began to organize coastal defenses. Vice Minister of War Song Yingchang was sent to Liaodong, a Ming region bordering Korea, to take command of the Korean campaign. A large army was also gathered in Liaodong. The Japanese occupation of Korea sparked a wave of popular resistance, which eventually escalated into a guerrilla war. The victories of the Korean navy, led by Admiral Yi Sun-sin, in the summer and autumn of 1592 played a crucial role in organizing the resistance.After the rebellion in Ningxia was defeated, part of the troops and several generals, including Li Rusong, reinforced the troops gathered in Liaodong. The Korean land army also rose up and, in early 1593, the Ming troops, led by Li Rusong, went into battle. By May 1593, the Sino-Korean forces had pushed the enemy to the vicinity of Busan in southeastern Korea. This led to the Japanese agreeing to negotiate a truce. However, the preliminary negotiations dragged on for several years and ultimately failed in October 1596. As a result, Hideyoshi decided to attack Korea again. Despite this, the second invasion in 1597 was not successful. The Japanese did manage to approach Seoul to within 80 km in August 1597, but were eventually pushed back to the southeast after the arrival of Ming troops. The outcome of the war was heavily influenced by naval operations. Initially, the Koreans suffered setbacks under an incompetent admiral, but after Yi Sun-sin was released from prison and placed in command of the fleet, they gained superiority at sea. This forced the Japanese onto the defensive between Ulsan and Sunchon. In May 1598, the Ming fleet arrived and reinforced the Korean fleet. Meanwhile, lengthy sieges and bloody battles took place on land. In the spring of 1598, part of the Japanese troops withdrew from Korea, while the rest successfully resisted the Ming-Korean attacks. After Hideyoshi&#x27;s death in September 1598, the remaining Japanese troops were evacuated from Korea by the end of the year.

The Imjin War was one of the largest military conflicts of the 16th century, with Japan mobilizing over 150,000 soldiers for the first invasion and over 140,000 for the second. The Ming dynasty also sent a significant number of troops, with over 40,000 soldiers in 1592 and more than double that in 1597. According to Chinese historian Li Guangtao, a total of 166,700 Ming soldiers were deployed to Korea and were provided with 17 million &quot;liang&quot; of silver and supplies, which was roughly equivalent to half a year&#x27;s income for the Ming state. While the exact number of Korean soldiers is difficult to estimate, it is believed that there were tens of thousands of them. The losses suffered by Korea were devastating, with the Japanese presenting Hideyoshi with the noses of their enemies as proof of their victory instead of the usual heads. Modern historians estimate that the number of noses brought back to Japan ranged from 100,000 to 200,000.

===Yang Yinglong rebellion===
The Yang family, descendants of a 9th-century Tang general, controlled a mountainous region on the border of Huguang, Guizhou, and Sichuan. The area spanned over 300 km in the east-west direction and slightly less in the north-south direction, with its center located in Bozhou. The clan ruled this territory for many centuries and, although originally Chinese, they assimilated and identified with the local Miao tribes over time.

Yang Yinglong inherited his position from his father during the Longqing era. He distinguished himself on the Ming side in battles against other natives and Tibetans, and also received recognition from the Ming court for the quality of the wood he supplied. However, he was very ambitious and viewed the Ming troops as weak. Problems with Yang Yinglong&#x27;s actions continued for the local Ming authorities from 1587. He became involved in disputes between the local Miao tribes and Chinese colonists by attacking the former. Initially, the government in Beijing rejected the local authorities&#x27; requests for intervention, stating that there were more pressing matters to attend to and that Yang Yinglong was simply seeking an opportunity to distinguish himself. However, in 1590, open and protracted fighting broke out between Yang Yinglong&#x27;s warriors and Ming forces. Eventually, Yang Yinglong submitted to the Ming authorities, but was unexpectedly sentenced to execution. In order to secure his release, he offered a large payment and five thousand troops for the war in Korea. After his release, however, he hid in the mountains and plundered a number of prefectures and counties. In 1595, he was caught again and once again escaped punishment by offering a deal. As a result, his son Yang Chaodong was given a hereditary post and another son was sent to Chongqing as a hostage. The emperor considered the matter settled and rewarded the commander. However, within a year, Yang Yinglong was once again leading raids on the provinces of Huguang, Sichuan, and Guizhou, and even declared himself emperor. Over the next three years, his hundred thousand Miao soldiers spread fear throughout the area.

Focused on the war in Korea, the Wanli Emperor postponed solving the problems in the relatively peripheral southwest of the empire until early 1599, when he appointed the distinguished official Guo Zichang (1543–1618) as pacification commissioner of Sichuan. The former head of the Censorate, Li Hualong, was promoted to vice minister of war and put in charge of the military affairs of Sichuan, Huguang, and Guizhou. Several generals from Korea were sent to Sichuan, including Li Rumei and the well-known and feared Liu Ting () in the southwest. Fighting with the rebels lasted the rest of the year, while they also attacked the major cities of Chongqing and Chengdu. At the turn of 1599/1600, minor skirmishes took place between the ever-strengthening Ming troops and the rebels. In the end, the Ming army had 240,000 soldiers from all over the empire. Yang Yinglong tried to mobilize indigenous warriors against the superior Ming troops, who were much better armed with cannons and rifles. He gathered perhaps up to 150,000 warriors by the end of 1599. However, even the Ming armies were largely composed of local natives. After extensive preparations, Li Hualong planned to attack the rebels from eight directions, each with an army of 30,000 men. He launched the attack at the end of March 1600. The Ming troops systematically pushed back the enemy and in early June, surrounded Yang Yinglong in the mountain fortress of Hailongtun. The fortress fell in a final assault in mid-July, with Yang Yinglong killed. According to Li Hualong&#x27;s final report, over 22,000 rebels were killed in the fighting.

Yang Yinglong&#x27;s chiefdom was then incorporated into the standard Chinese administrative system. In the following decade, Ming military actions continued quite successfully in the southwest, putting down several minor revolts. In an effort to prevent the recurrence of such a large-scale rebellion, the Ming authorities organized a systematic policing of the region.

===Other rebellions and border wars===
During the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s reign, there were numerous domestic uprisings and rebellions, with the most significant being the uprisings organized by the White Lotus sect in Shandong in 1587 and 1616.

Despite a peace agreement with the Mongol Altan Khan in 1571 and the resumption of Sino-Mongol trade, there were occasional armed clashes between the Ming state and its northern neighbors, although they were not a serious threat. These clashes sometimes involved tens of thousands of men. The Ming troops also conducted raids in Mongolia and Manchuria, resulting in the burning of settlements, killing of defiant leaders, and confiscation of livestock. For instance, in 1591, General Li Chengliang destroyed a Mongol camp during a raid, killing 280 Mongols and dispersing over a thousand of them. These types of actions were already an idea of Zhang Juzheng.

After 1571, relations with the Mongols living north and northwest of Beijing calmed down. However, the Mongols in Ordos remained restless and continued to raid Gansu. The Ming armies were able to successfully fight them, utilizing Tibetan and Uighur auxiliaries. In the northeast, the Mongols also attacked the Ming Liaodong. They were a formidable force, with up to 30,000–50,000 horsemen in battle. In 1598, even the Ming commander of the region, General Li Rusong, fell in battle against them.

There were also occasional conflicts on the southwestern border, where the Burmese violated the borders. In 1582-1583 and again in 1584, a Ming army led by General Liu Ting successfully repelled the Burmese and even penetrated deep into Burma. The Burmese launched another attack in Yunnan in the late 16th century. In response, the governor of Yunnan organized a counter-attack with Siam in 1594. In 1600, combined Ming-Siamese forces burned the Burmese capital of Pegu. In 1607, the Viets also raided the Yunnan and Guangxi borderlands.

===Đại Việt===
In the 1520s, a civil war broke out in Đại Việt (present-day northern Vietnam) between the Mạc dynasty, which had been ruling the northern part of the country since 1527, and the followers of the previous Lê dynasty in the south. In 1592, Lê Thế Tông&#x27;s army invaded the north and captured Hanoi and most of the country. The followers of the Mạc retreated to Cao Bằng Province and the surrounding area near the Sino-Vietnamese border. The government of Lê Thế Tông, led by Trịnh Tùng, who held more power than the monarch, established connections with the Ming regional authorities in an attempt to gain recognition for the Lê dynasty instead of the Mạc. In 1540, Mạc Đăng Dung was recognized by the Ming emperor (the Jiajing Emperor) as the ruler of Đại Việt, but the country&#x27;s status was reduced from a kingdom to a local command (; &quot;dutongshisi&quot;), which he administered as a pacification commissioner or commandant (; &quot;dutongshiguan&quot;, with the lower second rank). In 1597, after a year of negotiations, Lê Thế Tông arrived at the border with a thousand soldiers and servants to meet with a delegation of Ming regional officials in Ming territory. The meeting was held in a friendly manner, with Lê Thế Tông expressing his desire for Đại Việt to maintain its status as a tributary kingdom. However, the Ming representatives did not make any commitments. That same year, Lê Thế Tông sent Vice Minister of Works Phùng Khắc Khoan to Beijing as an envoy. Phùng Khắc Khoan made a good impression in Beijing with his classical education, but he was unable to gain recognition for Lê Thế Tông as the King of Đại Việt. The Wanli Emperor justified this by stating that the civil war was not yet over and it was uncertain if the Lê dynasty had true support. As a result, Lê Thế Tông only received the seal of the pacification commissioner.

===Spain, Portugal, and Japan===

In the early 1570s, the Spanish settled in the Philippines, centered in Manila. Trade with the Spanish was highly profitable for the Chinese, as silk in Manila was bought by the Spanish for double its price in China. The Spanish paid for Chinese goods in American silver, which they imported to China across the Pacific in considerable quantities, estimated to be between 50 and 350 tons per year. This trade between the Spanish Philippines and China flourished, leading to the rapid growth of a Chinatown in Manila. The number of Chinese settlers in Manila increased from forty in the early 1570s to 10,000 in 1588 and 30,000 in 1603. However, the Spanish authorities viewed the Chinese with suspicion and concern. This mutual distrust often resulted in armed clashes, and in 1603, a pogrom occurred in which 20 (according to Chinese sources) or 15 (according to Spanish sources) thousand Chinese lost their lives.

During the 1540s, American silver was also introduced to China through the extensive Portuguese trade. Lisbon elites were known to wear Chinese silks, drink Chinese tea, and order porcelain with European motifs from China. The Portuguese had settled in Macau with the consent of local authorities as early as the 1550s. In 1578, they were granted permission to trade in Guangzhou and have continued to do so since then. At the end of the 16th century, between 6 and 30 tons of silver were transported annually from Portugal to Macau. The Dutch also played a significant role in the trade, with the turnover of their trade at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries matching that of the Portuguese. By 1614, Amsterdam burghers were regularly purchasing blue and white Ming porcelain.

In addition to merchants, missionaries also traveled to China from Europe. The Jesuits, in particular, were successful in spreading the Christian faith through their strategic approach of honoring missionaries. Notable figures such as Michele Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci gained the trust of Chinese dignitaries and were able to persuade some to convert to Christianity. The Jesuits were highly esteemed in Beijing&#x27;s upper circles for their expertise in mathematics and astronomy, and Ricci was even accepted by the emperor.

In China, silver was a scarce commodity, making it more valuable than in other countries. This was well-known to European traders, who took advantage of the relative cheapness of Chinese goods. As a result, Chinese silk became popular in other parts of the world, such as Latin American countries like Peru and Mexico. This led to a decline in local silk production in Mexico, which had only been introduced by the Spanish a short time before. On the other hand, the textile industry, which utilized Chinese silk, flourished and even exported to European markets. By the 1630s, there was a significant Chinese community in Mexico City, and they also resided in other areas like Acapulco.

After the unification of Japan, the discovery of new silver mines and the improvement of mining techniques, the extraction and export of silver from Japan increased dramatically, particularly to Ming China. Between 1560 and 1600, the annual export of silver ranged from 33 to 49 tons. However, due to the Ming ban on trade with Japan, the import of Japanese silver was facilitated by the Portuguese. In the early 17th century, Japanese silver exports continued to rise, with the import of luxury goods such as silk (reaching up to 280 tons per year in the 1630s). Silk was so abundant and inexpensive in Japan that even some peasants were able to afford it, leading to a rise in its popularity among the lower classes.

===Russia===
In the autumn of 1618, the first Russian ambassadors arrived in Beijing. Led by Ivan Petlin, a group of Siberian Cossacks had been sent to China by the Tobolsk voivode Ivan Kurakin on the orders of Tsar Mikhail Fyodorovich. The journey began in May 1618 from Tomsk and involved crossing the mountains on the Russian-Mongolian border, passing through Mongolia and the Gobi, and finally arriving in Beijing in early September. However, due to the lack of gifts or credentials, the Cossacks were not granted an audience with the emperor by Ming officials. Despite this, they were warmly received at the Ministry of Rites and were given a letter from the Wanli Emperor, agreeing to future Russian missions and the arrival of Russian merchants. After a few days, the Russians began their return journey, arriving back in Tomsk in May 1619 and eventually reaching Moscow by the end of the year. However, due to Russia&#x27;s focus on European affairs, there were no further official contacts with China until the end of the Ming dynasty.

===Rise of the Jurchens===
In 1583, Nurhaci, the leader of one of the many Jurchen tribes in southern Manchuria, began to establish his own state. He united the Jurchens with the support of the Ming dynasty, particularly General Li Chengliang. However, some Ming officials grew concerned about Nurhaci&#x27;s growing power and called for his destruction in 1587. However, this issue was not resolved due to discussions within the Ming administration. Nurhaci acknowledged his subordinate relationship to the Ming dynasty and paid tribute in 1590 and 1597 by personally visiting Beijing. By the early 1590s, Nurhaci&#x27;s state had a large military force, estimated at 30–40,000 horsemen and 10,000 infantry. The Ming authorities declined his offer to lead his army into Korea against the Japanese. In 1599, as part of building his state, Nurhaci introduced a new Manchu script and in 1601, a new organization based on banners. In 1603, he reached an agreement with Ming generals in Liaodong to define the borders.

In 1618, Nurhaci had gained control over all the Jurchen tribes except for Yehe and Haixi, who were under Ming protection. An attack on these tribes would trigger a war with China, which is exactly what Nurhaci provoked by raiding Fushun in May 1618. The Ming retaliated with an expedition in early April 1619, after extensive and costly preparations. Yang Hao, a former commander in Liaodong and leader of the Ming forces in Korea from 1597 to 1598, was put in charge of the overall command. The army was divided into four corps, led by experienced generals (from north to south) Ma Lin, Du Song, Li Rubai, and Liu Ting. The Ming troops consisted of about 100,000 men, including 83,000 Chinese, with the rest being Korean and Jurchen allies. On the other hand, Nurhaci had 50–60,000 soldiers at his disposal, but unlike the Chinese, he did not divide them. Instead, he used his knowledge of the terrain, weather, and mobility to his advantage and crushed the individual Ming corps one by one. First, he defeated Du Song&#x27;s corps on 14 April, followed by Ma Lin&#x27;s the next day. Yang Hao, in response, ordered a retreat, and while Li Rubai attempted to retreat as well, the order did not reach Liu Ting and his corps, resulting in their defeat on 20 April. Generals Du Song and Liu Ting both fell in battle. After defeating the Ming, Nurhaci joined forces with the remaining Jurchens and occupied Kaiyuan, where he killed General Ma Lin, and Tieling in northern Liaodong. As a result of the defeat, Li Rubai was accused of cowardice and committed suicide under the weight of criticism, while Yang Hao was imprisoned and executed in 1629.

==Death; successors and their reign==
In the final months of his life, the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s health deteriorated significantly. In 1620, he experienced severe dizziness and was confined to his bed. Finally, he died on 18 August 1620. The day after his death, an edict was issued ordering the transfer of one million &quot;liang&quot; of silver from the emperor&#x27;s treasury to the frontier troops. Two days later, an additional million was sent from the treasury to strengthen the defenses of Liaodong. The edict also called for the abolition of mining and trade dues, and the dismissal of the eunuchs responsible for collecting them. On 28 August, the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s eldest son, Zhu Changluo, ascended the throne as the Taichang Emperor.

The Taichang Emperor relied on representatives and sympathizers of the Donglin movement, who were soon appointed to high positions. However, he soon fell ill and died on 26 September 1620. His fifteen-year-old son, Zhu Youjiao, became the new emperor as the Tianqi Emperor. The young emperor enjoyed working with wood, making furniture and wooden models of the palace, but he did not enjoy his official duties. During this time, there was a power struggle between the official and eunuch groups in the government. Initially, the Donglins had the upper hand, but from 1624, the court was dominated by the eunuch Wei Zhongxian. In 1627, after the death of the Tianqi Emperor, his younger brother Zhu Youjian ascended the throne as the Chongzhen Emperor and removed Wei Zhongxian&#x27;s clique. However, due to suspicion and a lack of purpose, he was unable to control the factionalism among officials and assemble a capable administration.

While the government was consumed by internal strife, conditions in the countryside worsened in the 1620s. From 1628, northern China was ravaged by war between rebellious peasants (Li Zicheng rebellion) and the government army. As a result, starving people fled to the cities and entire counties were destroyed in the countryside. The gentry were shocked by the depth of resentment of the poor against the rich, and the state administration began to disintegrate. In 1644, Li Zicheng&#x27;s army captured Beijing and the Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide. General Wu Sangui, who commanded the Ming border army north of Beijing, saw no other option but to submit to the Qing dynasty (which was renamed in the mid-1630s from the Jurchen state founded by Nurhaci). With the support of the landlords and gentry, the Qing army quickly defeated the rebels and took control of northern China. In the following years, they also conquered the south of the country. In 1662, Wu Sangui, at the head of the Qing army, detained and executed the last Ming emperor, Zhu Youlang, in Yunnan.

==Assessment==
One of the many historical accounts of the Wanli Emperor and his reign is a unique book written by the eunuch Liu Ruoyu (, 1584 – c. 1642) titled &quot;Zhuozhong zhi&quot; (; &#x27;An Enlightening Account of Life in the Imperial Palace&#x27;). This book provides a detailed description of life in the palace during that time.

The Wanli Emperor is often portrayed in traditional Chinese historiography as one of the main causes of the decline and fall of the Ming dynasty. Classical Chinese historians focused on his greed, misuse of eunuch power, factionalism within the government, seclusion in the Forbidden City, indulgence in alcohol and sex, extravagant tomb construction, and political blunders. The &quot;History of Ming&quot; (the official Ming history completed in 1739) and subsequent works depict him as a lazy, selfish, and reckless ruler who only cared about his harem and neglected state affairs. The animosity of Confucian scholars towards the Wanli Emperor stemmed from different visions of the state and the emperor&#x27;s protection of military officers against complaints from civilian officials who controlled the administration at the time. Even modern Chinese works on the Wanli Emperor continue to adhere to this traditional perspective. Furthermore, Western historiography tends to adopt the viewpoint of Chinese Confucians and perpetuates it. For example, Charles Hucker&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Ming Biography&quot; (1976) and Ray Huang&#x27;s portrayal of the Wanli Emperor in his books &quot;1587, a Year of No Significance: The Ming Dynasty in Decline&quot; (1981), as well as in his chapter on the Wanli Emperor in the &quot;Cambridge History of China, Volume 7&quot; (1988). It is primarily Ray Huang who is responsible for the Western perception of the Wanli Emperor as an isolated and frustrated emperor, &quot;trapped&quot; by his own bureaucracy.

The downfall of the Ming political system can be attributed to its reliance on ideological and moral principles. Zhang Juzheng, in his pursuit of effective rule through personal relationships, faced criticism from his opponents who focused on his personal life, deeming it immoral and illegitimate. This led to a lack of focus on the practical outcomes of his policies. After Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s death, the government became divided into factions, with officials in the Censorate and ministries engaging in feuds and purging Zhang&#x27;s supporters. As a result, important reforms were neglected, and the emperor&#x27;s indecisiveness only worsened the situation. The emperor was not interested in ruling according to the ideas of his officials, preferring to act according to his own will and disliking being pressured. However, he lacked the qualities of an effective despot. His mishandling of the succession question also eliminated the Grand Secretariat as a potential center for government restructuring—as attempted by Gao Gong and Zhang Juzheng—as its Grand Secretaries were suspected by the government of supporting the emperor, depriving them of the ability to mediate between the ruler and the government.

The Wanli Emperor, like Zhang Juzheng, attempted to increase the military strength of the empire, control the civilian bureaucracy, reduce factionalism, and rely more on military officers rather than civil officials. During the first three decades of his reign, he devoted himself greatly to military affairs and did not hesitate to allocate funds for the army, including the 1619 expedition. Despite the defeat in 1619, he made efforts to protect the officers, such as Li Rubai, who were targeted by the government. During the Wanli era, the Ming armies maintained control over the border with the Mongols, intervened in border disputes in Burma, conducted raids in Mongolia and Manchuria, suppressed a major rebellion in Ningxia, participated in the war in Korea, and deployed 200,000 soldiers to suppress a rebellion in Sichuan and quell minor rebellions. However, after the Battle of Sarhū, the Ming government became embroiled in factional conflicts and began to blame others for their failures. Later Chinese Confucian scholars emphasized the defeats at Sarhū and downplayed the previous victories achieved by eunuchs, soldiers, and the emperor.

==Family==
The Wanli Emperor had 18 children by eight women, including eight sons, five of whom lived to adulthood, and two daughters who survived. The most important women in his life were his mother, Empress Dowager Li, and his favorite concubine, Lady Zheng. Behind them were Empress Wang and Lady Wang, the mother his eldest son.

After the death of the Longqing Emperor and the accession of the young Wanli Emperor to the throne in 1572, his mother was given the title of Empress dowager. In accordance with tradition, she headed the government during her son&#x27;s minority, although the decisions remained in the hands of Senior Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng. She formed a ruling alliance with the head eunuch Feng Bao and retained her influence even after Zhang Juzheng&#x27;s death. She also formed alliances with Grand Secretaries Shen Shixing, Xu Guo (), and Wang Xijue. She was a devout Buddhist and made large donations to Buddhist monks and monasteries. She supported the succession of the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s eldest son, the later Taichang Emperor, against the younger Zhu Changxun, the son of Wanli&#x27;s favorite Lady Zheng. When the emperor objected that his eldest son was the son of a mere palace servant, she replied that he, the Wanli Emperor, was also the son of a mere servant.

In 1577, Empress Dowager Chen (the Longqing Emperor&#x27;s widow) and Empress Dowager Li (the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s mother) organized the selection of a wife for the young emperor. They chose the twelve-year-old Wang Xijie, who was married to the Wanli Emperor in early 1578 and became the empress. However, she only had one daughter and no sons. The Wanli Emperor did not have a good relationship with his empress and instead devoted himself to Lady Zheng. The empress, on the other hand, maintained a dignified public image and showed respect to Empress Dowager Li. She also supported Wanli&#x27;s eldest son, who would later become the Taichang Emperor, over Lady Zheng&#x27;s son. However, she was known for her strictness and cruelty within the imperial palace, causing fear among those who served her. The empress died in April 1620, just a few months before the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s own death.

Lady Wang served as a servant in the palace of Empress Dowager Li. In late 1581, during one of his visits to his mother, the emperor took notice of a young maid who soon became pregnant with his child. Although the Wanli Emperor initially wanted nothing to do with the child, his mother convinced him to acknowledge paternity by providing records of his visits. In August 1582, Lady Wang gave birth to a son, Zhu Changluo, who was the emperor&#x27;s first child. Two years later, the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s concubine, Lady Zheng, gave birth to a daughter, Zhu Xuanshu, and quickly gained the emperor&#x27;s favor and trust, causing his interest in Lady Wang to diminish. She lived in seclusion in the Forbidden City and was neglected by the emperor. It was not until 1606, after the birth of Zhu Changluo&#x27;s first son (the later Tianqi Emperor), that Lady Wang was granted the title of &quot;Imperial Noble Consort&quot; (&quot;Huang Guifei&quot;), which was appropriate for the mother of an heir. She died in 1611.

Lady Zheng was chosen to join the emperor&#x27;s harem in 1581, and soon after her arrival, she captured his attention and love. In 1586, after giving birth to Zhu Changxun, she was promoted to the position of &quot;Imperial Noble Consort&quot;, which was just one step below that of empress. She went on to have a total of six children. However, her and the emperor&#x27;s desire to name Zhu Changsun as the successor instead of their eldest son, Zhu Changluo, caused a political crisis. Despite the emperor&#x27;s efforts, he was unable to overcome the strong opposition from his ministers and officials, and the decision was postponed for almost two decades. It was not until 1601 that Zhu Changluo was finally appointed as crown prince. In 1615, Lady Zheng was suspected of being involved in the &quot;man with a stick&quot; incident, but these were only rumors and nothing was ever proven. Zhu Changluo fell ill shortly after taking the throne and died after just one month of reign. Once again, Lady Zheng was the subject of rumors that she was responsible for his death, but there was no concrete evidence to support these accusations. She died in 1630.

==Tomb==

The Wanli Emperor was buried in the Ming tombs at the base of the Tianshou Mountain, located outside of Beijing. This site is the final resting place for thirteen of the sixteen emperors who reigned from 1368 to 1644. The Wanli Emperor&#x27;s burial complex, known as the Ding Mausoleum, was constructed between 1584 and 1590. It consists of three walled courtyards, each containing smaller buildings. The second and third courtyards are separated by a three-tiered terrace, which leads to a vast sacrificial hall measuring 30x67 meters. At the back of the third courtyard stands a mound surrounded by a three-meter-high rampart. In 1956–1957, Chinese archaeologists excavated the mound and discovered an underground structure. This structure includes an entrance hall, an outer hall, a middle hall, and a proper burial chamber. The middle hall is accessible through entrances on the left and right side chambers, as well as the back of the chamber. The burial chamber, which is 9.1x30 meters and 9.5 meters high, is larger than the other rooms. The entrance is located in the middle of the longer side. Inside the burial chamber, archaeologists found wooden coffins containing the remains of the emperor, empress, and the Taichang Emperor&#x27;s mother. Over three thousand objects were also discovered, including jewelry, gold and silver items, jade and porcelain objects, clothing, and the crowns of the emperor and empress.

The archaeological survey conducted in the 1950s has been considered unprofessionally carried out in China since the 1990s. Due to a lack of necessary knowledge, it was not possible to preserve and protect wooden and textile artifacts. The report of the survey was compiled in 1986 based on the preserved notes of the participants in the excavations. Additionally, many of the discovered objects, including the remains of the emperor and his wives, were destroyed by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.

<text>The Taichang Emperor (28 August 1582 – 26 September 1620), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Guangzong of Ming, personal name Zhu Changluo, was the 15th emperor of the Ming dynasty. He was the eldest son of the Wanli Emperor and succeeded his father as emperor in 1620. However, his reign came to an abrupt end less than one month after his enthronement when he was found dead one morning in the palace following a bout of diarrhea. He was succeeded by his son, Zhu Youjiao, who was enthroned as the Tianqi Emperor. His reign was the shortest in Ming history.

The Taichang Emperor was born in 1582, during the tenth year of the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s reign. His mother, Lady Wang, was a servant of the emperor&#x27;s mother. Lady Wang was promoted, but did not gain the favor of the Wanli Emperor, and her son, despite being the emperor&#x27;s eldest, was ignored by him. Instead, the Wanli Emperor showed preference towards Zhu Changxun, the son of his favorite concubine, Lady Zheng. This led to the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s intention to appoint Zhu Changxun as crown prince, but it faced strong opposition from the ministers. As a result, the matter remained at a standstill for many years due to the stubbornness of both sides.

In 1601, the Wanli Emperor finally succumbed to the pressure of ministers, officials, and above all his mother, and officially appointed nineteen-year-old Zhu Changluo as the crown prince and rightful heir to the throne. However, even with this formal recognition, intrigue and the emperor&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the succession persisted. In 1615, the court was rocked by an unusual scandal when a man named Zhang Chai armed himself with a wooden staff and broke into the Forbidden City, specifically targeting the Crown Prince&#x27;s palace. While the initial investigation deemed him insane, another investigator suggested the involvement of two eunuchs close to Lady Zheng. Both eunuchs were swiftly executed, but speculation about the true perpetrators of the plot continued to circulate.

The Wanli Emperor died on 18 August 1620, and Zhu Changluo officially ascended the throne as the Taichang Emperor on 28 August. However, just a few days after his coronation, he fell ill and died on 26 September 1620, despite attempts at treatment. The Taichang Emperor&#x27;s eldest son, Zhu Youjiao, then became the new Ming ruler. The death of the relatively young emperor sparked suspicion, speculation, and recrimination among different court factions.

==Childhood and youth, appointment as heir to the throne==
Zhu Changluo, the future Taichang Emperor, was born in 1582, during the tenth year of the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s reign, as the emperor&#x27;s first son. His mother, Lady Wang, was a servant of Empress Dowager Li, the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s mother. Although the Wanli Emperor initially wanted nothing to do with the child, Lady Li convinced him to acknowledge paternity by presenting records of his visits. She also pushed for Lady Wang&#x27;s promotion to imperial concubine with the title &quot;Consort Gong&quot; (). However, the emperor&#x27;s interest in Lady Wang quickly faded as he became infatuated with another concubine, Lady Zheng, who also bore him a son named Zhu Changxun (1586–1641). As a result, Zhu Changluo, despite being the eldest, was ignored by the emperor.

In 1586, the question of succession arose when the emperor promoted Lady Zheng to the rank of &quot;Imperial Noble Consort&quot; (&quot;Huang Guifei&quot;), placing her just below the empress and above his other concubines, including Lady Wang. It was evident to those around him that he preferred Lady Zheng&#x27;s son Zhu Changxun—his third son (the second had died in infancy)—to succeed him rather than Zhu Changluo. This caused a division among officials, with some advocating for the rights of the first son based on legal primogeniture, while others supported Lady Zheng. In response to the widespread support for the eldest son, the emperor delayed making a decision. He justified the delay by stating that he was waiting for a son from the empress. When the request was made to appoint Zhu Changluo as crown prince at the age of eight so that his education could officially begin, the emperor defended himself by saying that princes were traditionally taught by eunuchs.

In 1589, the emperor agreed to appoint Zhu Changluo as his successor. However, this decision was met with opposition from Lady Zheng, causing controversy and, two years later, even arrests when a pamphlet was circulated in Beijing accusing her of conspiring against the emperor&#x27;s eldest son with some high officials. Despite this, the emperor tried to portray Lady Zheng in a positive light to the public.

The failure to name a successor sparked protests from not only opposition-minded officials, but also high dignitaries such as Grand Secretaries Shen Shixing (in office 1578–91) and Wang Xijue (in office 1584–91 and 1593–94). The empress and Empress Dowager Li also supported the rights of Zhu Changluo. However, it was not until 1601, under pressure from further protests and requests, that the Wanli Emperor finally appointed Zhu Changluo as crown prince. At the same time, Zhu Changxun was given the title of Prince of Fu, but he was kept in Beijing instead of being sent to the province as originally planned when he turned eighteen in 1604. This fueled rumors that the question of succession was still open. It was not until 1614, after a long series of appeals and protests, that the emperor&#x27;s mother intervened and insisted on sending Zhu Changxun to the provincial seat.

==Case of the attack with the stick==
Related to the succession debates was the &quot;case of the attack with the stick&quot;. In late May 1615, a man named Zhang Chai was arrested near the palace of Zhu Changluo for carrying a stick. It was later discovered that Zhang Chai was mentally unstable and had intended to use the stick to resolve a conflict with two eunuchs he did not get along with. Initially, the case was closed and Zhang Chai was executed. However, prison official Wang Zhicai intervened and pushed for a public investigation involving representatives from the Ministry of Justice. This new version of the case suggested that Zhang Chai was mentally sound and had been manipulated by two eunuchs close to Lady Zheng and her brother. This raised suspicions that their goal was to kill the heir and install Lady Zheng&#x27;s son in his place. The case caused a stir at court and the Wanli Emperor took the unprecedented step of summoning civil and military officials from the Beijing authorities for a meeting. This was the first time the emperor had met with officials from the &quot;outer court&quot; since 1602. He appeared before them with his family, including Zhu Changluo, Zhu Changluo&#x27;s sons and daughter, and expressed his disappointment and disbelief that they would doubt his relationship with the heir in whom he trusted and relied upon. Zhu Changluo also confirmed his close relationship with his father and asked for an end to the whole affair. Despite this, the emperor ordered the execution of Zhang Chai and the two eunuchs involved in the case. However, representatives from the Ministry of Justice demanded further investigation and the Grand Secretaries brokered a compromise. Zhang Chai was executed the next day, but the suspected eunuchs were to be interrogated. The interrogation did take place, but both eunuchs remained under the supervision of the emperor&#x27;s eunuchs. On the fifth day after the emperor&#x27;s speech, the officials were informed that the eunuchs had died. The case then fell silent.

==Emperor==
On 18 August 1620, the Wanli Emperor died. His son, Zhu Changluo, officially took the throne on 28 August 1620 (the first day of the 8th month of the Chinese calendar). Many people in Beijing saw this new monarch as a chance for a fresh start. As he was not related to his father, there was hope that he would abandon the Wanli Emperor&#x27;s policies. On 19 August, 1 million &quot;liang&quot; (37.3 tons) of silver from the palace treasury was sent to defend the northeastern borders, due to the critical situation in Liaodong, where Nurhaci&#x27;s Jurchens were attacking. Additionally, the mining and commercial taxes that had been introduced in the 1590s were abolished, and the eunuch tax commissioners, who were responsible for collecting these taxes, were recalled from the provinces. All of these actions were carried out in accordance with the last wishes of the deceased emperor. On 21 August, the Taichang Emperor sent another million &quot;liang&quot; of silver to Liaodong.

Zhu Changluo chose the name Taichang for his era, symbolizing peace and prosperity in contrast to the turmoil of the previous reign. To address the long-standing issue of vacant positions in the administration, the new emperor appointed many critics of the previous government who had been removed from their positions for opposing the Wanli Emperor. Among the first to be summoned were Zuo Yuanbiao (; 1551–1624) and Feng Congwu (; 1556–1627), both associated with the Donglin movement. The Donglin supporters had largely supported Zhu Changluo during the dispute over the succession in the 1580s and 1590s.

==Illness and death, the Red Pill Case==
Three days after his enthronement, the Taichang Emperor fell ill. On 5 September, his condition worsened, and he called for a physician. During audiences on 8 and 9 September, he appeared unwell and soon took to his bed. On 13 September, he was visited again by the physician and a group of officials. The emperor complained of insomnia and loss of appetite. The officials were concerned and when they heard that Cui Wensheng (), the eunuch in charge of the imperial clinic, had given the emperor a laxative, they accused him of incompetence. The officials believed that the emperor needed strengthening medicine instead. The emperor refused to accept the accusation, but also stopped taking the mentioned medicine.

Several days passed with Taichang officiating from his bed, but on 17 September, he became overwhelmed and began to speak of his impending death. During a visit from concerned officials, led by Grand Secretary Fang Congzhe, on 25 September, the emperor requested red pills, which he had heard were being produced by Li Keshao, an assistant director in the Court of State Ceremonial. Li later testified that he believed his pills helped strengthen the emperor&#x27;s diseased body. That same day, the imperial guards and eunuchs brought Li Keshao to the emperor, who ordered him to make the pills. In the presence of the aforementioned (thirteen) officials, Li made the pills using lead, autumn mineral, human milk and cinnabar—all tonic drugs in traditional Chinese medicine—which were provided to him by the emperor&#x27;s eunuchs. He then gave one pill to the emperor, who felt relieved and became hungry, requesting another pill. However, Li refused, stating that one pill was enough and two would be too many. The emperor then sent Li Keshao and the officials home after midnight. The following morning at dawn, the eunuchs announced that the emperor had died. Some members of the Donglin movement accused Li Keshao and Grand Secretary Fang Congzhe of poisoning the emperor, while others among the thirteen officials present took a more cautious approach, attempting to absolve themselves of any negligence. The controversy surrounding the red pills—whether they caused the emperor&#x27;s death intentionally or unintentionally—sparked heated debates and accusations over the next few years.

After the Taichang Emperor&#x27;s death, a power struggle emerged over the succession of his fourteen-year-old successor, Zhu Youjiao. Lady Li, the Taichang Emperor&#x27;s favored concubine, clashed with the ministers and Grand Secretaries for control. Despite Lady Li&#x27;s resistance and that of her eunuchs, the eunuchs loyal to the officials ultimately handed the boy over to them and banished Lady Li to another palace. Zhu Youjiao officially ascended to the throne on 1 October 1620.

<text>The Tianqi Emperor (23 December 1605 – 30 September 1627), personal name Zhu Youjiao, was the 16th emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1620 to 1627. He was the eldest son of the Taichang Emperor and an elder brother of the Chongzhen Emperor, who succeeded him. &quot;Tianqi&quot;, the era name of his reign, means &quot;heavenly opening&quot;.

==Biography==
Zhu Youjiao became emperor at the age of 15, following the death of his father, the Taichang Emperor, who ruled less than a month. He did not pay much attention to state affairs, and was accused of failing in his filial duties to his late father by not continuing the latter&#x27;s wishes. It is possible that Zhu Youjiao suffered from a learning disability or something more. He was illiterate and showed no interest in his studies. However, he was an outstanding carpenter and craftsman, often spending vast amounts of time on woodworking and instructing his servants to sell his creations undercover on the market just to see how much they were worth.

Because the Tianqi Emperor was unable to read court memorials and uninterested in state affairs, the court eunuch Wei Zhongxian and the emperor&#x27;s wet nurse Madam Ke seized power and controlled the Ming imperial court, with the Tianqi Emperor as merely a puppet ruler. The Tianqi Emperor apparently devoted his time to carpentry. Wei Zhongxian took advantage of the situation and began appointing the people he trusted to important positions in the imperial court. Meanwhile, Madam Ke sought to retain power by removing all other women from the emperor&#x27;s harem by locking away the emperor&#x27;s concubines and starving them to death. It is believed that he had two private palaces; one for his female lovers and one for his male lovers.

One Confucian moralist group, the Donglin Movement, expressed distress at the conditions of the government. In response, the imperial court, under Wei Zhongxian&#x27;s control, covertly ordered the execution of a number of officials associated with the Donglin Movement. Living conditions worsened during the Tianqi Emperor&#x27;s reign. The Ming dynasty also faced several popular uprisings.
The Tianqi Emperor died heirless on 30 September 1627 due to his only son having died in the Wanggongchang Explosion and was succeeded by his fifth and sole surviving brother, Zhu Youjian. Zhu Youjian was enthroned as the Chongzhen Emperor.

<text>The Chongzhen Emperor (6 February 1611 – 25 April 1644), personal name Zhu Youjian, courtesy name Deyue, was the 17th and last emperor of the Ming dynasty. He reigned from 1627 to 1644. &quot;Chongzhen&quot;, the era name of his reign, means &quot;honorable and auspicious.&quot;

Zhu Youjian was son of the Taichang Emperor and younger brother of the Tianqi Emperor, whom he succeeded to the throne in 1627. He battled peasant rebellions and was not able to defend the northern frontier against the Manchu. When rebels under Li Zicheng reached the capital Beijing in 1644, he committed suicide, ending the Ming dynasty. The Manchu formed the succeeding Qing dynasty.

In 1645, Zhu Yousong, who had proclaimed himself the Hongguang Emperor of the Southern Ming dynasty, gave the Chongzhen Emperor the temple name &quot;Sizong&quot;. In historical texts, &quot;Sizong&quot; is the most common temple name of the Chongzhen Emperor, even though the Southern Ming rulers had changed &quot;Sizong&quot; to &quot;Yizong&quot; (毅宗) and then to &quot;Weizong&quot; (威宗). The Qing dynasty gave the Chongzhen Emperor the temple name &quot;Huaizong&quot; (懷宗), but the temple name was later revoked.

== Early life ==
Zhu Youjian was the fifth son of Zhu Changluo, the Taichang Emperor, and one of his low-ranking concubines, Lady Liu. When Zhu Youjian was four years old, his mother was executed by his father for reasons unknown and was buried secretly. Zhu Youjian was then adopted by his father&#x27;s other concubines. He was first raised by Consort Kang, and after she adopted his eldest brother Zhu Youjiao, he was raised by Consort Zhuang.

All of the Taichang Emperor&#x27;s sons died before reaching adulthood except for Zhu Youjiao and Zhu Youjian. Zhu Youjian grew up in a relatively lonely but quiet environment. After the Taichang Emperor died in 1620, Zhu Youjian&#x27;s elder brother Zhu Youjiao succeeded their father and was enthroned as the Tianqi Emperor. He granted the title &quot;Prince of Xin&quot; (信王) to Zhu Youjian and posthumously honoured Zhu Youjian&#x27;s mother, Lady Liu, as &quot;Consort Xian&quot; (賢妃). Fearing the court eunuch Wei Zhongxian, who controlled the Tianqi Emperor, Zhu Youjian avoided attending imperial court sessions under the pretext of illness until he was summoned to court by his brother in 1627. At the time, the Tianqi Emperor was gravely ill and wanted Zhu Youjian to rely on Wei Zhongxian in the future.
== Reign ==
When the Tianqi Emperor died in October 1627, he had no surviving heir (his last son died a year prior during the mysterious Wanggongchang Explosion). As the emperor&#x27;s brother, Zhu Youjian, then about 16 years old, ascended the throne as the Chongzhen Emperor. His succession was helped by Empress Zhang (widow of the Tianqi Emperor), despite the manoeuvres of the chief eunuch, Wei Zhongxian, who wanted to continue to dominate the imperial court. From the beginning of his rule, the Chongzhen Emperor did his best to stem the decline of the Ming dynasty. His efforts at reform focused on the top ranks of the civil and military establishment. However, years of internal corruption and an empty treasury made it almost impossible to find capable ministers to fill important government posts. The emperor also tended to be suspicious of his subordinates, executing dozens of field commanders, including general Yuan Chonghuan, who had directed the defence of the northern frontier against the Manchu (later known as the Qing dynasty). The Chongzhen Emperor&#x27;s reign was marked by his fear of factionalism among his officials, which had been a serious issue during the reign of the Tianqi Emperor. After his brother&#x27;s death, the Chongzhen Emperor immediately eliminated Wei Zhongxian and Madam Ke, as well as other officials thought to be involved in the &quot;Wei-Ke conspiracy&quot;.

Meanwhile, partisans of the Donglin Academy faction, which had been devastated under Wei Zhongxian&#x27;s influence, established political organizations throughout the Jiangnan region. Chief among these was the &quot;Fushe&quot;, or Restoration Society, whose members were a new generation of scholars who identified with the old Donglin faction. They succeeded in placing their members into high government posts through the imperial examinations of 1630 and 1631. The reversal of Wei Zhongxian&#x27;s fortunes resulted in a renewal of the Donglin faction&#x27;s influence at court, arousing great suspicion from the Chongzhen Emperor. The nomination of Donglin favorite Qian Qianyi for the post of Grand Secretary led to accusations of corruption and factionalism by his rival Wen Tiren. Qian Qianyi was imprisoned on the emperor&#x27;s orders. Though he was soon released, his status was reduced to that of a commoner and he returned to Jiangnan. Wen Tiren would later become Grand Secretary himself.

=== Peasant rebellions and Manchu invasion ===
In the early 17th century, persistent drought and famine driven by the Little Ice Age accelerated the collapse of the Ming dynasty. Two major popular uprisings swelled up, led by Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng, both poor men from famine-hit Shaanxi who took up arms in the 1620s. At the same time, Ming armies were occupied in the defence of the northern border against the Manchu ruler Hong Taiji, whose father, Nurhaci, had united the Manchu tribes into a cohesive force. In 1636, after years of campaigns against Ming fortifications north of the Great Wall, Hong Taiji declared himself emperor of the Qing dynasty.

Through the 1630s, rebellion spread from Shaanxi to nearby Huguang and Henan. From 1633 to 1644, the Great Plague of Jingshi devastated northern China. In 1641, Xiangyang fell to Zhang Xianzhong, and Luoyang to Li Zicheng. The next year, Li Zicheng captured Kaifeng. The year after that, Zhang Xianzhong took Wuchang and established himself the ruler of his Xi kingdom. Court officials offered a number of unrealistic proposals to stop the rebel armies, including the establishment of archery contests, the restoration of the &quot;weisuo&quot; military colony system, and the execution of disloyal peasants. Li Zicheng took Xi&#x27;an in late 1643, renaming it Chang&#x27;an, which had been the city&#x27;s name when it was the capital of the Tang dynasty. On the lunar New Year of 1644, he proclaimed himself king of the Shun dynasty and prepared to capture Beijing.

By this point, the situation had become critical for the Chongzhen Emperor, who rejected proposals to recruit new militias from the Beijing region and to recall general Wu Sangui, the defender of Shanhai Pass on the Great Wall. The Chongzhen Emperor had dispatched a new field commander, Yu Yinggui, who failed to stop Li Zicheng&#x27;s armies as they crossed the Yellow River in December 1643. Back in Beijing, the capital defence forces consisted of old and feeble men, who were starving because of the corruption of eunuchs responsible for provisioning their supplies. The troops had not been paid for nearly a year. Meanwhile, the capture of Taiyuan by Li Zicheng&#x27;s forces gave his campaign additional momentum; garrisons began to surrender to him without a fight. Through February and March 1644, the Chongzhen Emperor declined repeated proposals to move the court south to Nanjing, and in early April, he rejected a suggestion to move the crown prince to the south.

=== Death ===

In April 1644, the Ming imperial court finally ordered Wu Sangui to move his army south from his fortress at Ningyuan to Shanhai Pass. It was too late, however, and Wu would not reach Shanhai Pass until 26 April. Word reached Beijing that Shun rebels were approaching the capital through Juyong Pass, and the Chongzhen Emperor held his last audience with his ministers on 23 April. Li Zicheng offered the emperor an opportunity to surrender, but the negotiations produced no result. Li commanded his forces to attack on 24 April. Rather than face capture by the rebels, the Chongzhen Emperor gathered all members of the imperial household except his sons. Using his sword, he killed Consort Yuan and Princess Zhaoren, and severed the arm of Princess Changping. 

On 25 April, the Chongzhen Emperor was said to have walked to Meishan, a small hill in present-day Jingshan Park. There, he either hanged himself on a tree, or strangled himself with a sash. By some accounts, the emperor left a suicide note that said, &quot;I die unable to face my ancestors in the underworld, dejected and ashamed. May the rebels dismember my corpse and slaughter my officials, but let them not despoil the imperial tombs nor harm a single one of our people.&quot; According to a servant who discovered the emperor&#x27;s body under a tree, however, the words &quot;tianzi&quot; (Son of Heaven) were the only written evidence left after his death. The emperor was buried in the Ming tombs.

The Manchus were quick to exploit the death of the Chongzhen Emperor: by claiming to &quot;avenge the emperor,&quot; they rallied support from loyalist Ming forces and civilians. The Shun dynasty lasted less than a year with Li Zicheng&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Shanhai Pass. The victorious Manchus established the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty as ruler of all China. Because the Chongzhen Emperor had refused to move the court south to Nanjing, the new Qing government was able to take over a largely intact Beijing bureaucracy, aiding their efforts to displace the Ming.

After the Chongzhen Emperor&#x27;s death, loyalist forces proclaimed a Southern Ming dynasty in Nanjing, naming Zhu Yousong (the Prince of Fu) as the Hongguang Emperor. In 1645, however, Qing armies started to move against the Ming remnants. The Southern Ming, again bogged down by factional infighting, were unable to hold back the Qing onslaught, and Nanjing surrendered on 8 June 1645. Zhu Yousong was captured on 15 June and brought to Beijing, where he died the following year. The dwindling Southern Ming were continually pushed farther south, and the last emperor of the Southern Ming, Zhu Youlang, was finally caught in Burma, transported to Yunnan, and executed in 1662 by Wu Sangui.

== Legacy ==

While the Chongzhen Emperor was not especially incompetent by the standards of the later Ming, he nevertheless sealed the fate of the Ming dynasty. In many ways, he did his best to save the dynasty. However, despite a reputation for hard work, the emperor&#x27;s paranoia, impatience, stubbornness and lack of regard for the plight of his people doomed his crumbling empire. His attempts at reform did not take into account the considerable decline of Ming power, which was already far advanced at the time of his accession. Over the course of his 17-year reign, the Chongzhen Emperor executed seven military governors, 11 regional commanders, replaced his minister of defence 14 times, and appointed an unprecedented 50 ministers to the Grand Secretariat (equivalent to the cabinet and chancellor). Even though the Ming dynasty still possessed capable commanders and skilled politicians in its dying years, the Chongzhen Emperor&#x27;s impatience and paranoid personality prevented any of them from enacting any real plan to salvage a perilous situation.

In particular, the Chongzhen Emperor&#x27;s execution of Yuan Chonghuan on extremely flimsy grounds was regarded as the decisively fatal blow. At the time of his death, Yuan was supreme commander of all Ming forces in the northeast, and had just rushed from the borders to defend the capital against a surprise Manchu invasion. For much of the preceding decade, Yuan had served as the Ming Empire&#x27;s bulwark in the north, where he was responsible for securing Ming borders at a time when the Empire was suffering humiliating defeat after defeat. His unjust death destroyed Ming military morale and removed one of the greatest obstacles to the eventual Manchu conquest of China.

<text>Astronomical symbols are abstract pictorial symbols used to represent astronomical objects, theoretical constructs and observational events in European astronomy. The earliest forms of these symbols appear in Greek papyrus texts of late antiquity. The Byzantine codices in which many Greek papyrus texts were preserved continued and extended the inventory of astronomical symbols. New symbols have been invented to represent many planets and minor planets discovered in the 18th to the 21st centuries.

These symbols were once commonly used by professional astronomers, amateur astronomers, alchemists, and astrologers. While they are still commonly used in almanacs and astrological publications, their occurrence in published research and texts on astronomy is relatively infrequent, with some exceptions such as the Sun and Earth symbols appearing in astronomical constants, and certain zodiacal signs used to represent the solstices and equinoxes.

Unicode has encoded many of these symbols, mainly in the Miscellaneous Symbols, Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows, Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs,
and Alchemical Symbols blocks.

== Symbols for the Sun and Moon ==
The use of astronomical symbols for the Sun and Moon dates to antiquity. The forms of the symbols that appear in the original papyrus texts of Greek horoscopes are a circle with one ray () for the Sun and a crescent for the Moon. The modern Sun symbol, a circle with a dot (☉), first appeared in Europe in the Renaissance.

In modern academic writing, the Sun symbol is used for astronomical constants relating to the Sun. Teff☉ represents the solar effective temperature, and the luminosity, mass, and radius of stars are often represented using the corresponding solar constants (, , and , respectively) as units of measurement.

== Symbols for the planets ==
 
Symbols for the classical planets appear in many medieval Byzantine codices in which many ancient horoscopes were preserved. The written symbols for Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn have been traced to forms found in late Greek papyrus texts. The symbols for Jupiter and Saturn are identified as monograms of the corresponding Greek names, and the symbol for Mercury is a stylized caduceus. According to A.S.D. Maunder, antecedents of the planetary symbols were used in art to represent the gods associated with the classical planets; &quot;Bianchini&#x27;s planisphere&quot;, discovered by Francesco Bianchini in the 18th century, produced in the 2nd century, shows Greek personifications of planetary gods charged with early versions of the planetary symbols: Mercury has a caduceus; Venus has, attached to her necklace, a cord connected to another necklace; Mars, a spear; Jupiter, a staff; Saturn, a scythe; the Sun, a circlet with rays radiating from it; and the Moon, a headdress with a crescent attached.

A diagram in Byzantine astronomer Johannes Kamateros&#x27;s 12th century &quot;Compendium of Astrology&quot; shows the Sun represented by the circle with a ray, Jupiter by the letter Zeta (the initial of Zeus, Jupiter&#x27;s counterpart in Greek mythology), Mars by a shield crossed by a spear, and the remaining classical planets by symbols resembling the modern ones, without the cross-mark at the bottom of the modern versions of the symbols for Mercury and Venus. These cross-marks first appear around the 16th century. According to Maunder, the addition of crosses appears to be &quot;an attempt to give a savour of Christianity to the symbols of the old pagan gods.&quot;

The symbols for Uranus were created shortly after its discovery. One symbol, , invented by J. G. Köhler and refined by Bode, was intended to represent the newly discovered metal platinum; since platinum, commonly called white gold, was found by chemists mixed with iron, the symbol for platinum combines the alchemical symbols for the planetary elements iron, ♂, and gold, ☉. 
Another symbol, , was suggested by Joseph Jérôme Lefrançois de Lalande in 1784. In a letter to William Herschel, Lalande described it as &quot;un globe surmonté par la première lettre de votre nom&quot; (&quot;a globe surmounted by the first letter of your name&quot;). Today, Köhler&#x27;s symbol is more common among astronomers, and Lalande&#x27;s among astrologers, although it is not uncommon to see each symbol in the other context.

Several symbols were proposed for Neptune to accompany the suggested names for the planet. Claiming the right to name his discovery, Urbain Le Verrier originally proposed the name &quot;Neptune&quot; and the symbol of a trident, while falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the planet &quot;Leverrier&quot;, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago, who in turn proposed a new symbol for the planet (). However, this suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name &quot;Herschel&quot; for &quot;Uranus&quot;, after that planet&#x27;s discoverer Sir William Herschel, and &quot;Leverrier&quot; for the new planet. Professor James Pillans of the University of Edinburgh defended the name &quot;Janus&quot; for the new planet, and proposed a key for its symbol. Meanwhile, German-Russian astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve presented the name &quot;Neptune&quot; on December 29, 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. In August 1847, the Bureau des Longitudes announced its decision to follow prevailing astronomical practice and adopt the choice of &quot;Neptune&quot;, with Arago refraining from participating in this decision.

The International Astronomical Union discourages the use of these symbols in journal articles, though they do occur. In certain cases where planetary symbols might be used, such as in the headings of tables, the &quot;IAU Style Manual&quot; permits certain one- and (to disambiguate Mercury and Mars) two-letter abbreviations for the names of the planets.

==Symbols for asteroids==

Following the discovery of Ceres in 1801 by the astronomer and Catholic priest Giuseppe Piazzi, a group of astronomers ratified the name, which Piazzi had proposed. At that time, the sickle was chosen as a symbol of the planet.

The symbol for 2 Pallas, the spear of Pallas Athena, was invented by Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, who organized a group of twenty-four astronomers to search for a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The symbol was introduced by von Zach in 1802.
In a letter to von Zach, discoverer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers (who had discovered and named Pallas) expressed his approval of the proposed symbol, but wished that the handle of the sickle of Ceres had been adorned with a pommel instead of a crossbar, to better differentiate it from the sign of Venus.

German astronomer Karl Ludwig Harding created the symbol for 3 Juno. Harding, who discovered this asteroid in 1804, proposed the name Juno and the use of a scepter topped with a star as its astronomical symbol.

The symbol for 4 Vesta was invented by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Olbers, having previously discovered and named 2 Pallas, gave Gauss the honor of naming his newest discovery. Gauss decided to name the new asteroid for the goddess Vesta, and also designed the symbol (): the altar of the goddess, with the sacred fire burning on it. Other contemporaneous writers use a more elaborate symbol () instead.

Karl Ludwig Hencke, a German amateur astronomer, discovered the next two asteroids, 5 Astraea (in 1845) and 6 Hebe (in 1847). Hencke requested that the symbol for 5 Astraea be an upside-down anchor; however, a weighing scale was sometimes used instead. Gauss named 6 Hebe at Hencke&#x27;s request, and chose a wineglass as the symbol.

As more new asteroids were discovered, astronomers continued to assign symbols to them. Thus, 7 Iris (discovered 1847) had for its symbol a rainbow with a star; 8 Flora (discovered 1847), a flower; 9 Metis (discovered 1848), an eye with a star; 10 Hygiea (discovered 1849), an upright snake with a star on its head; 11 Parthenope (discovered 1850), a standing fish with a star; 12 Victoria (discovered 1850), a star topped with a branch of laurel; 13 Egeria (discovered 1850), a buckler; 14 Irene (discovered 1851), a dove carrying an olive branch with a star on its head; 15 Eunomia (discovered 1851), a heart topped with a star; 16 Psyche (discovered 1852), a butterfly wing with a star; 17 Thetis (discovered 1852), a dolphin with a star; 18 Melpomene (discovered 1852), a dagger over a star; and 19 Fortuna (discovered 1852), a star over Fortuna&#x27;s wheel.

In most cases the discovery reports only describe the symbols and do not draw them; from Hygiea onward, there are significant glyph variants as well as a significant delay between the discovery and the symbols having been communicated to the astronomical community as a whole. Consequently, astronomical publications were not always complete. The discovery reports for Melpomene and Fortuna do not even describe the symbols, which only appear in a later reference work by the discoverer; the symbols are drawn in the reports for Astraea, Hebe, and Thetis. Benjamin Apthorp Gould criticised the symbols in 1852 as being often inefficient at suggesting the bodies they represented and difficult to draw, and pointed out that the symbol that had been described for Irene had to his knowledge never actually been drawn. The same year, John Russell Hind expressed the contrary view that the symbols were easier to remember than the numbers, but also admitted that the names were more commonly used than either the numbers or the symbols.

The last edition of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (BAJ, Berlin Astronomical Yearbook) to use asteroid symbols was for the year 1853, published in 1850: although it includes eleven asteroids up to Parthenope, it only includes symbols for the first nine (up to Metis), noting that the symbols for Hygiea and Parthenope had not yet been made definitively known. The last edition of the British &quot;The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris&quot; to include asteroid ephemerides was that for 1855, published in 1852: despite fifteen asteroids being known (up to Eunomia), symbols are only included for the first nine.

Johann Franz Encke made a major change in the BAJ for the year 1854, published in 1851. He introduced encircled numbers instead of symbols, although his numbering began with Astraea, the first four asteroids continuing to be denoted by their traditional symbols. This symbolic innovation was adopted very quickly by the astronomical community. The following year (1852), Astraea&#x27;s number was bumped up to 5, but Ceres through Vesta were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The &quot;Astronomical Journal&quot; edited by Gould adopted the symbolism in this form, with Ceres at 1 and Astraea at 5. This form had previously been proposed in an 1850 letter by Heinrich Christian Schumacher to Gauss. The circle later became a pair of parentheses, which were easier to typeset, and the parentheses were sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades. Thus the iconic asteroid symbols fell out of use; reference works continued giving them for the next few decades, though they often noted them as being obsolete.

A few asteroids were given symbols by their discoverers after the encircled-number notation became widespread. 26 Proserpina (discovered 1853), 28 Bellona (discovered 1854), 35 Leukothea (discovered 1855), and 37 Fides (discovered 1855), all discovered by German astronomer Robert Luther, were assigned, respectively, a pomegranate with a star inside; a whip and spear; an antique lighthouse; and a cross. These symbols were drawn in the discovery reports. 29 Amphitrite was named and assigned a shell for its symbol by George Bishop, the owner of the observatory where astronomer Albert Marth discovered it in 1854, though the symbol was not drawn in the discovery report.
All these symbols are rare or obsolete in modern astronomy, though NASA has used Ceres&#x27; symbol when describing the dwarf planets, and Psyche&#x27;s symbol may have influenced the design of the insignia for the &quot;Psyche&quot; mission. The major use of symbols for minor planets today is by astrologers, who have invented symbols for many more objects, though they sometimes use symbols that differ from the historical symbols for the same bodies.

The symbol for 99942 Apophis, a near-Earth asteroid discovered in 2004 that attracted interest when initial observations suggested a significant probability of an Earth impact in 2029 (a possibility since eliminated), is much later. It was designed by Denis Moskowitz, who also designed many of the dwarf-planet symbols, at a time when asteroid symbols had become extremely rare in astronomy. Nonetheless, its inclusion of a star is meant to recall the 19th-century asteroid symbols.

The symbol, a monogram of the letters PL, could be interpreted to stand for Pluto or for Percival Lowell, the astronomer who initiated Lowell Observatory&#x27;s search for a planet beyond the orbit of Neptune. Pluto has an alternative symbol consisting of an orb over Pluto&#x27;s bident: it is more common in astrology than astronomy, and was popularised by the astrologer Paul Clancy, but has been used by NASA to refer to Pluto as a &quot;dwarf&quot; planet. There are a few other astrological symbols for Pluto that are used locally. Pluto also had the IAU abbreviation P when it was considered the ninth planet.

The other large trans-Neptunian objects were only discovered around the dawn of the 21st century. They were not generally thought to be planets on their discovery, and planetary symbols had in any case mostly fallen out of use among astronomers by then. Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer in Massachusetts, proposed astronomical symbols for the dwarf planets Quaoar, Sedna, Orcus, Haumea, Eris, Makemake, and Gonggong. These symbols are somewhat standard among astrologers (e.g. in the program Astrolog), which is where planetary symbols are most used today. Moskowitz has also proposed symbols for Varuna, Ixion, and Salacia, and others have done so for additional TNOs, but there is little consistency between sources.

NASA has used Moskowitz&#x27;s symbols for Haumea, Makemake, and Eris in an astronomical context, and Unicode labels the symbols for Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, and Orcus (added to Unicode in 2022) as &quot;astronomy symbols&quot;. Therefore, symbols mentioned in the Unicode proposal for Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, and Orcus have been shown below to fill out the list of named TNOs down to 600 km diameter, even though not all of them are actually attested in astronomical use. (Grundy et al. suggest 600 to 700 km diameter as a speculative upper limit for a trans-Neptunian object to retain substantial pore space.)

== Symbols for zodiac and other constellations ==

The zodiac symbols have several astronomical interpretations. Depending on context, a zodiac symbol may denote either a constellation, or a point or interval on the ecliptic plane.

Lists of astronomical phenomena published by almanacs sometimes included conjunctions of stars and planets or the Moon; rather than print the full name of the star, a Greek letter and the symbol for the constellation of the star was sometimes used instead.
The ecliptic was sometimes divided into 12 &quot;signs&quot;, each subdivided into 30 degrees,
and the &quot;sign&quot; component of ecliptic longitude was expressed either with a number from 0 to 11. or with the corresponding zodiacal symbol.

In modern astronomical writing, all the constellations, including the 12 of the zodiac, have dedicated three-letter abbreviations, which specifically refer to &quot;constellations&quot; rather than &quot;signs&quot;.
The zodiac symbols are also sometimes used to represent points on the ecliptic, particularly the solstices and equinoxes. Each symbol is taken to represent the &quot;first point&quot; of each &quot;sign&quot;, rather than the place in the visible &quot;constellation&quot; where the alignment is observed.
Thus, ♈︎ the symbol for Aries, represents the March equinox;
♋︎, for Cancer, the June solstice;
♎︎, for Libra, the September equinox;
and ♑︎, for Capricorn, the December solstice.

Although the use of astrological sign symbols is rare, the particular symbol ♈︎ for Aries, is an exception; it is commonly used in modern astronomy to represent the location of the (slowly) moving reference point for the ecliptic and equatorial celestial coordinate systems.

Ophiuchus has been proposed as a thirteenth sign of the zodiac by astrologer Walter Berg in 1995, who gave it a symbol that has become popular in Japan.

None of the constellations have official symbols. However, occasional symbols for the modern constellations, as well as older ones that occur in modern nomenclature, have appeared in publication. The symbols below were devised by Denis Moskowitz (except those for the 13 constellations already listed above).

== Other symbols ==
Symbols for aspects and nodes appear in medieval texts, although medieval and modern usage of the node symbols differ; the modern ascending node symbol (☊) formerly stood for the descending node, and the modern descending node symbol (☋) was used for the ascending node. In describing the Keplerian elements of an orbit, ☊ is sometimes used to denote the ecliptic longitude of the ascending node, although it is more common to use Ω (capital omega, and inverted ℧), which were originally typographical substitutes for the astronomical symbols.

The symbols for aspects first appear in Byzantine codices. Of the symbols for the five Ptolemaic aspects, only the three displayed here — for conjunction, opposition, and quadrature — are used in astronomy.

Symbols for a comet (☄) and a star () have been used in published astronomical observations of comets. In tables of these observations, ☄ stood for the comet being discussed and for the star of comparison relative to which measurements of the comet&#x27;s position were made.

Meteor showers also have limited use of astronomical symbols in the literature, designed by Denis Moskowitz. They are based on the parent constellation symbols, with letters included to disambiguate the Aquariids and Taurids.
: Delta Aquariids 
: Eta Aquariids 
: Geminids 
: Leonids 
: Lyrids 
: Orionids 
: Perseids 
: Quadrantids 
: Taurids 
: Ursids 
For planetary transits of Mercury and Venus, Moskowitz proposed overlaying the respective planetary symbol on that of the Sun, extending the crossbar into an arrow: (Mercury), (Venus). This also has some limited use.

Limited use can also be found of Moskowitz&#x27;s symbol for Halley&#x27;s Comet, : it is simply the standard comet symbol with an H.

<text>Peadar Kearney ( ; 12 December 1883 – 24 November 1942) was an Irish republican and composer of numerous rebel songs. In 1907 he wrote the lyrics to &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Song&quot; (), now the Irish national anthem. He was the uncle of Irish writers Brendan Behan, Brian Behan, and Dominic Behan.

==Background==
Kearney was born in 1883 at 68 Lower Dorset Street, Dublin, above one of the two grocer&#x27;s shops owned by his father, John Kearney (1854–1897), originally from Funshog, Collon, County Louth. John soon after lost his businesses and lived precariously as an insurance agent. Peadar&#x27;s mother, Katie &quot;née&quot; McGuinness (1859/60–1907), was from Rathmaiden, Slane, County Meath. Peadar was educated at the Model School, Schoolhouse Lane and St. Joseph&#x27;s C.B.S. in Fairview. He heard Willie Rooney give nationalist lectures on history in the Mechanics&#x27; Institute. He started at Belvedere College but played truant to escape beatings, so that his father ended his education and got him a job at a bicycle repair shop. His father died of pneumonia soon after, leaving Peadar to support his mother and five younger siblings. He had various menial jobs for three years before being apprenticed to a house painter. He is a distant relative of Irish-Spanish resident Sandra Dunne (formerly Brady) of the Campoamor region in Spain

==Political activity==
In 1901, the death of William Rooney prompted Kearney to join the Willie Rooney Branch of the Gaelic League. He joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1903. He taught night classes in Irish and numbered Seán O&#x27;Casey among his pupils. He found work with the National Theatre Society and in 1904 was one of the first to inspect the derelict building that became the Abbey Theatre, which opened its doors on 27 December of that year. He assisted with props and performed occasional walk-on parts at the Abbey until 1916.

Kearney was a co-founder of the Irish Volunteers in 1913. He took part in the Howth and Kilcoole gun runnings in 1914. In the Easter Rising of 1916 Kearney fought at Jacob&#x27;s biscuit factory under Thomas MacDonagh, abandoning an Abbey Theatre tour in England to take part in the Rising. He escaped before the garrison was taken into custody.

He was active in the War of Independence. On 25 November 1920 he was captured at his home in Summerhill, Dublin and was interned first in Collinstown Camp in Dublin and later in Ballykinler Camp in County Down.

Kearney at first took the Free State side in the Civil War but lost faith in the Free State after Collins&#x27;s death. He took no further part in politics, returning to his original trade of house painting. Kearney died in relative poverty in Inchicore in 1942. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin. He was survived by his wife Eva and two sons, Pearse and Con.

==Songs and legacy==
Kearney&#x27;s songs were highly popular with the Volunteers (which later became the IRA) in the 1913–22 period. Most popular was &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Song&quot;. Kearney penned the original English lyrics in 1907 and his friend and musical collaborator Patrick Heeney composed the music. The lyrics were published in 1912 and the music in 1916. After 1916 it replaced &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; as the anthem of Irish nationalists. The Irish Free State was established in 1922 and formally adopted the anthem in 1926. Subsequently, theatres and the state broadcaster began playing the anthem at the end of performances, and Kearney prepared to take legal action to demand royalties, obliging the state to acquire the copyright in 1934 for £980 (half each to Kearney and the heirs of Heeney, who had died). From the 1930s, the anthem was increasingly sung in Irish, in a translation by Liam Ó Rinn.

Other well-known songs by Kearney include &quot;Down by the Glenside&quot;, &quot;The Tri-coloured Ribbon&quot;, &quot;Down by the Liffey Side&quot;, &quot;Knockcroghery&quot; (about the village of Knockcroghery) and &quot;Erin Go Bragh&quot; (Erin Go Bragh was the text on the Irish national flag before the adoption of the tricolour).

Kearney was the uncle of the writers Brendan, and Dominic Behan, both of whom were also republicans and songwriters, via his sister Kathleen Kearney who married Stephen Behan, one of Michael Collins&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Apostles&quot;. Brendan Behan was in prison when Kearney died, and was refused permission to attend his funeral. In a letter to Kearney&#x27;s son, Pearse, he said, &quot;my Uncle Peadar was the one, outside my own parents, who excited the admiration and love that is friendship.&quot;

Famed Irish sculptor and artist James Power did a portrait of Kearney in 1962 and is currently in the Kilmainham Gaol Museum. In 1957 his sister Margaret&#x27;s son, Seamus de Burca (or Jimmy Bourke), published a biography of Kearney, &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Song: The Story of Peadar Ó Cearnaigh&quot;. In 1976 De Burca also published Kearney&#x27;s letters to his wife written during his internment in 1921 were published as &quot;My Dear Eva ... Letters from Ballykinlar Internment Camp, 1921&quot;. A wall plaque on the west side of Dorset Street commemorates his birth there.

<text>Gaeta (; ; Southern Laziale: &quot;Gaieta&quot;) is a seaside resort in the province of Latina, in Lazio, Italy. Set on a promontory stretching towards the Gulf of Gaeta, it is from Naples and from Rome.

The city has played a conspicuous part in military history; its walls date to Roman times and were extended and strengthened in the 15th century, especially throughout the history of the Kingdom of Naples (later the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies). 

Present-day Gaeta is a fishing and oil port and a renowned seaside resort. NATO has a naval base in Gaeta.

==History==

===Ancient times===
Ancient Caieta was situated on the slopes of the Torre di Orlando, a promontory overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. It was inhabited by the Oscan-speaking Italic tribe of the Aurunci by the 10th-9th century BC. Only in 345 BC did the territory of Gaeta come under Rome&#x27;s influence. 

Caieta, with its temperate climate like the neighbouring Formia and Sperlonga, became one of the earliest locations of &quot;villae maritimae&quot;, seaside villas and luxurious retreats for the Roman elite owned, for example, by Scipio Africanus (236-183 BC) and Gaius Laelius. Caieta was also linked to the capital of the Roman Empire by the Appian Way and its extension the Via Flacca. 

The remains of the monumental villa of Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 56 BC), stepfather of Augustus, are in Hotel Irlanda in the Arcella area. Lucius Munatius Plancus (consul in 42 BC) had a vast villa located on Monte Orlando overlooking the Gulf of Gaeta. His mausoleum, built at the end of the 1st century BC, is still an impressive monument inside a large clearing within the villa.

Lucius Sempronius Atratinus probably lived here as indicated by his mausoleum. Atratinus was suffect Consul in 40 and 34 BC, &quot;propraetor&quot; in Greece in 39 BC, and first admiral of Mark Antony&#x27;s fleet from 38-34 BC. 

In the Roman imperial age, it continued as a popular seaside resort for many important and rich characters of Rome. Emperor Domitian (r. 81-96 AD) also had a villa in the area.

Emperor Antoninus Pius restored the port, given its strategic relevance.

Remains of an aqueduct that supplied the town from the Conca hill can be seen a few metres from the villa of Hortensius.

===Middle Ages===
At the beginning of the Middle Ages, after the Lombard invasion, Gaeta remained under the suzerainty of the Byzantine Empire. In the following years, like Amalfi, Sorrento and Naples did, it would seem to have established itself as a practically independent port and to have carried on a thriving trade with the Levant.

As Byzantine influence declined in Southern Italy, the town began to grow. For fear of the Saracens, in 840, the inhabitants of the neighbouring Formiæ fled to Gaeta. Though under the suzerainty of Byzantium, Gaeta had then, like nearby ports Naples and Amalfi, a republican form of government with a &quot;dux&quot; (&quot;duke&quot; or commanding lord under the command of the Byzantine Exarch of Ravenna), as a strong bulwark against Saracen invasion.

Around 830, it became a lordship ruled by hereditary &quot;hypati&quot; or consuls: The first of these was Constantine (839–866), who in 847 aided Pope Leo IV in the naval fight at Ostia. At this same time (846), the episcopal see of Gaeta was founded when Constantine, Bishop of Formiae, fled thither and established his residence. He was associated with his son Marinus I. They were probably violently overthrown (they disappeared suddenly from history) in 866 or 867 by Docibilis I, who, looking rather to local safety, entered into treaties with the Saracens and abandoned friendly relations with the papacy. Nevertheless, he greatly expanded the duchy and began the construction of the palace. The greatest of the &quot;hypati&quot; was possibly John I, who helped crush the Saracens at Garigliano in 915 and gained the title of &quot;patricius&quot; from the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII.

The principle of co-regency governed the early dynasties: Docibilis I associated John with him, and John, in turn, associated his son Docibilis II with him. In 933, three generations were briefly co-ruling: John I, Docibilis II, and John II. On the death of Docibilis II (954), who first took the title &quot;dux&quot;, the duchy passed from its golden age and entered a decline marked by a division of territory. John II ruled Gaeta and his brother, Marinus, ruled Fondi with the equivalent title of duke. Outlying lands and castles were given away to younger sons, and thus the family of the Docibili slowly declined after the mid-century.

Allegedly, but improbably, from the end of the 9th century, the principality of Capua claimed Gaeta as a courtesy title for the younger son of its ruling prince. In the mid-10th century, the &quot;De Ceremoniis&quot; of Constantine VII lists the ceremonial title &quot;prince of Gaeta&quot; among the protocols for letters written to foreigners.

Prince Pandulf IV of Capua captured Gaeta in 1032 and deposed Duke John V, assuming the ducal and consular titles. In 1038, Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno took it from him and, in 1041, established the Norman counts of Aversa, who were afterwards princes of Capua, as puppet dukes. The native dynasty made a last attempt to wrest the duchy from Guaimar in 1042 under Leo I of Gaeta.

In 1045, the Gaetans elected their Lombard duke, Atenulf I. His son, Atenulf II, was made to submit to the Norman Prince Richard I of Capua in 1062 when Gaeta was captured by Jordan I of Capua. In 1064, the city was placed under a line of puppet dukes, appointed by the Capuan princes, who had usurped the ducal and consular titles. These dukes, usually Italianate Normans, ruled Gaeta with some level of independence until the death of Richard III of Gaeta in 1140. In that year, Gaeta was definitively annexed to the Kingdom of Sicily by Roger II, who bestowed on his son Roger of Apulia, who was duly elected by the nobles of the city. The town did maintain its coinage until as late as 1229 after the Normans had been superseded by the centralising Hohenstaufen.

Gaeta, owing to its important strategic position, was often attacked and defended bravely in the many wars for possession of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. In 1194, the Pisans, allies of Emperor Henry VI in the conquest of the kingdom, took possession of the city and held it as their own.

In 1227, Frederick II, who was King of Sicily since 1198, was in the city and strengthened the castle. However, in the struggle between Frederick and the Papacy, in 1228, it rebelled against Frederick II and surrendered to the pope after the Papal forces destroyed the castle in the fray. After the peace of San Germano of 1230, it was returned to the Sicilian kingdom. In 1233, Frederick regained control of the important port and fortress. Following the division between the Kingdom of Sicily, Gaeta became a possession of the new Kingdom of Naples. In 1279, Charles I of Anjou rebuilt the castle and enhanced the fortifications. In 1289, King James II of Aragon besieged the city in vain. From 1378, Gaeta hosted for some years antipope Clement VII. The future King of Naples Ladislaus lived in Gaeta from 1387. Here, on 21 September, he married Costanza Chiaramonte, whom he repudiated three years later.

King Alfonso V of Aragon (as Alfonso I of Naples) made Gaeta his beachhead for the conquest of the Kingdom of Naples in 1435, besieged it, and to his disadvantage, displayed great generosity by aiding those unable to bear arms which had been driven out from the besieged town. After a disastrous naval battle, he captured it and gained control of the kingdom. He enlarged the castle, which became his royal palace, and created a mint. In 1451, the city was home to the Treaty of Gaeta, stipulated between Alfonso V and the Albanian lord, Skanderbeg: the treaty ensured protection of the Albanian lands in exchange for political suzerainty of Skanderbeg to Alfonso.

===Modern era===
In 1495, King Charles VIII of France conquered the city and sacked it. The following year, however, Frederick of Naples regained it with a tremendous siege which lasted from 8 September to 18 November. In 1501, Gaeta was retaken by the French; however, after their defeat at the Garigliano (3 January 1504), they abandoned it to Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Ferdinand II of Aragon&#x27;s general.

In 1528, Andrea Doria, admiral of Charles V, defeated a French fleet in the waters off Gaeta and gave the city to its emperor. Gaeta was thenceforth protected with a new and more extensive wall encompassing Monte Orlando.

In the War of the Spanish Succession, on 30 September 1707, Gaeta was stormed and taken after a three-month siege by the Austrians under General Daun. On 6 August 1734, it was taken by French, Spanish and Sardinian troops under the future King Charles III of Spain after a stubborn defence by the Austrian viceroy of four months. Charles&#x27; daughter Infanta Maria Josefa of Spain was born here in 1744. The fortifications were again strengthened; in 1799, the French temporarily occupied it.

On 18 July 1806, the French captured it under André Masséna, after a heroic defence. It was created as a duché grand-fief in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples, but under the French name Gaète, for finance minister Martin-Michel-Charles Gaudin, in 1809 (family extinguished in 1841). On 8 August 1815, it capitulated to the Austrians after a three-months siege. It had been attacked and partially reduced by ships of the Royal Navy on 24 July 1815.

After his flight from the Roman Republic, Pope Pius IX took refuge at Gaeta in November 1848. He remained in Gaeta until 4 September 1849.

On 1 August 1849, USS &quot;Constitution&quot; while in port at Gaeta, received onboard King Ferdinand II and Pope Pius IX, giving them a 21-gun salute. This was the first time a Pope set foot on American territory or its equivalent.

In 1860, Gaeta was the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies&#x27; last Northern outpost. During the 1861 siege, King Francis II of the Two Sicilies offered a stubborn defence, shut up in the fortress with 12,000 men and was inspired by the heroic example by his wife Queen Maria Sophie after Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s occupation of Naples. It was not until 13 February 1861 that Francis II was forced to capitulate when the withdrawal of the French fleet made bombardment from the sea possible, thus sealing the annexation of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies to the Kingdom of Italy. Enrico Cialdini, the Piedmontese general, received the victory title of &quot;Duke of Gaeta&quot;. During the functioning of the Government of Montenegro in exile from 1919 to 1924, that supported the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty and opposed the rule of the house of Karađorđević in Yugoslavia (The Greens) were located in Gaeta.

===Contemporary age===

After the Risorgimento and until World War II, Gaeta grew in importance and wealth as a harbour. The nearby town of Elena, separated after the Risorgimento and named after the queen of Italy, was reunited with Gaeta following World War I. Benito Mussolini transferred Gaeta from the southern region known today as Campania (formerly Terra di Lavoro, to which it is historically and culturally attached) to the central region of Lazio.

After the king dismissed Mussolini in the summer of 1943, the latter was initially taken via Gaeta to the island prison of Ponza. After Italy surrendered to the Allies, however, the town&#x27;s fortunes began to decline. Recognising its strategic importance and fearing an Allied landing in the area, German troops occupied the city and expelled most of the population. The exclusion zone extended five kilometres from the historical city centre. Soon after, however, the population was expelled even beyond this point. The Gaetani were finally ordered to leave the area completely. Those who could not be placed in a concentration camp and a few were taken to Germany.

Following the Allied advance across the Garigliano River and the Allied occupation of Rome, the Gaetani were allowed to return to their city and begin the process of rebuilding. In subsequent decades the city has boomed as a beach resort, and it has seen some success marketing its agricultural products, primarily its tomatoes and olives. Many of its families count seamen among their number. However, the decades since World War II have been as difficult for Gaeta as they have been for most of Italy&#x27;s &quot;Mezzogiorno&quot;. In particular, its importance as a passenger seaport has nearly vanished: ferries to Ponza and elsewhere now leave from the nearby town of Formia. All attempts to build a permanent industry as a source of employment and economic well-being for the town have failed. Notable losses include the Littorina rail line (now used as a parking lot and a marketplace), the AGIP refinery (nowadays a simple depot), and the once-thriving glass factory, which has become an unused industrial relic.

Gaeta does have a viable tourism industry, as it is a popular seaside resort. Its warm, rain-free summers attract people to its numerous beaches along the coastline, such as Serapo and Sant&#x27;Agostino&#x27;s beaches. Nearly equidistant to Naples and Rome, Gaeta is a popular summer tourist destination for people from both cities&#x27; metropolitan areas.

==Main sights==

The main attractions of the city include:
* The Aragonese-Angevine Castle. Its origins are uncertain: most likely it was built in the 6th century, in the course of the Gothic War, or during the 7th century to defend the town from the Lombards&#x27; advance. The first documents mentioning it date to the age of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, who strengthened it in 1233. The current structure is made of two different edifices: the &quot;Angevine&quot; one, in the lower sector, dating to the House of Anjou&#x27;s rule in the Kingdom of Naples; and the &quot;Aragonese&quot;, at the top, built by emperor Charles V, together with the other fortifications that made Gaeta one of the strongest fortresses in southern Italy. The Angevine wing housed a military jail until the 1980s (German war criminal officers Walter Reder and Herbert Kappler were imprisoned here). Now it is a property of Gaeta&#x27;s municipality, which uses it for conferences and exhibitions. In the dome of the tallest tower is the Royal Chapel, built by King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies in 1849.
* The Mausoleum of Lucius Munatius Plancus (22 BCE) is a cylindrical travertine monument at the top of Monte Orlando (168 m). It stands at 13.20 m and has a diameter of 29.50 m. Another important Roman public man, Lucius Sempronius Atratinus, Mark Antony&#x27;s fleet commander, has a mausoleum sited in the more recent district of Gaeta: of similar diameter; it is, however not as well preserved.
*The Sanctuary of &quot;SS. Trinità&quot; was mentioned as early as the 11th century and visited, among the others, by St. Francis and Saint Philip Neri. The Crucifix Chapel was built in 1434 over a rock which had fallen from the nearby cliffs. From the sanctuary, the &quot;Grotta del Turco&quot; can be visited: it is a grotto which ends directly in the sea and where the waves create atmospheric effects of light.
*&quot;Sanctuary of Santissima Annunziata&quot; - A church and adjacent hospital were built at the site in the 14th century but rebuilt at the beginning of the 17th century in Baroque style by Andrea Lazzari. It houses works by Renaissance painters including Andrea Sabbatini and GF Criscuolo; as well as late-Baroque artists such as Luca Giordano, Sebastiano Conca and Giacinto Brandi. The church has a Gothic-style sarcophagus of Enrico Caracciolo. Also notable is the &quot;Golden Chapel or Grotto&quot;, a Renaissance-style chapel where Pope Pius IX meditated before issuing the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. The ceiling is gilded, and the walls contain 19 canvases (1531) by Criscuolo. The main altarpiece is an &quot;Immacolata&quot; by Scipione Pulzone.
*&quot;San Giovanni a Mare&quot; - The church was initially built outside the old sea walls by the hypate Giovanni IV in the 10th century. It combines the basilica form with the Byzantine one. The simple façade has a Gothic portal and a dome, while the interior has a nave with two aisles. The inner pavement is slightly inclined to allow waters to flow away in the case of maritime floods.
*The Cathedral of &quot;Assunta e Sant&#x27;Erasmo&quot; was erected over a more ancient church, Santa Maria del Parco, and consecrated by Pope Paschal II in 1106: it had a nave with six aisles separated by columns with Gothic capitals. In 1778, however, two of the aisles were suppressed, and the Gothic lines were hidden. In the 13th century, Moorish arches were added over the capitals. In 1663 the crypt was decorated in Baroque style. The interior houses a banner from the Battle of Lepanto, donated by Pope Pius V to Don John of Austria, who used it as his admiral&#x27;s flag. The main sight of the church is, however, the marble Paschal candelabrum, standing 3.50 m tall, from the late 13th century: it is in Romanesque style, decorated with 48 reliefs in 4 vertical rows, telling the &quot;Stories of the Life of Jesus&quot;. There are also paintings by Giacinto Brandi and Giovanni Filippo Criscuolo. The cathedral contains the relics of St. Erasmus, transferred from Formia; the remarkable campanile, in Arab-Norman style, dates from the 12th century. At the base are slabs and parts of columns from ancient Roman edifices.
*The Cathedral has a great bell tower, standing at 57 m, which is considered the city&#x27;s finest piece of art. The base has two marble lions, and the whole construction largely reused ancient Roman architectural elements. The upper part, octagonal in plan, with small Romanesque arches with majolica decoration, was completed in 1279.
*The Chapel of the Crucifix is a curiosity: built on a huge mass of rock that hangs like a wedge between two adjoining walls of rock. Legend tells how the rock was thus split at Christ&#x27;s death.
*&quot;San Francesco&quot; - According to the legend, the church was constructed by the saint himself in 1222. In reality, Frederick II ordered the construction. The church features a fine Gothic-Italian style and hosts paintings and sculptures by many of the most famous Neapolitan artists.
*The parish church of Santa Lucia, the former &quot;St. Maria in Pensulis&quot;, was once a Royal chapel and here prayed Margaret of Durazzo and King Ladislaus. It originally had Romanesque and Sicilian-Arab lines, but in 1456 it was rebuilt in Renaissance style and 1648 adapted to a Baroque one. The site has a Mediaeval &quot;pronaos&quot; with ancient fragments and figures of animals.
*The Medieval Quarter of Gaeta is itself of interest. It lies on the steep sides of Mount Orlando and has characteristic houses from the 11th-13th centuries.
*The Temple of St. Francis, a church located in the historic center of the city.

Gaeta is also the centre of the Regional Park of &quot;Riviera di Ulisse&quot;, which includes Mount Orlando, Gianola and the Scauri Mounts, and the two promontories of Torre Capovento and Tiberius&#x27; Villa in Sperlonga.

==U.S. Navy base==

In 1967, the homeport of the U.S. Sixth Fleet flagship relocated from Villefranche-sur-Mer to Gaeta. Support facilities were established in Mount Orlando. This was done following the transfer of the responsibilities of Lead Nation for NATO Naval Forces in the Mediterranean from the United Kingdom to the United States. The British Mediterranean Fleet was abolished - its former base in Malta was no longer exclusively under British control due to that nation having achieved independence from the UK.

It is currently used as the home port for the flagship of the United States Sixth Fleet. The Sixth Fleet commander, typically a 3-Star US Navy Vice-Admiral, has operational control of Naval task forces, battle groups, amphibious forces, support ships, land-based surveillance aircraft, and submarines in the Mediterranean Sea. Gaeta&#x27;s role has been important since the early 19th century to the US Navy&#x27;s commitment to forward presence. Pope Pius IX and King Ferdinand II of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, paid visits to the while in Gaeta in 1849. Nine ships have been stationed in Gaeta, with the primary mission of serving as the flagship for the Sixth Fleet commander. The first was the . Other Sixth Fleet flagships included , , , , and . The current flagship is the .

The town is host to the families of the crews who work on the ship. There was a DOD school for American children and the US Naval Support Activity, Gaeta, which provided health care and other services until it was closed down in 2005. The NATO base itself was located on Monte Orlando, which overlooks the Gulf of Gaeta. It has recently been transferred to a shore-based facility where the Commander Sixth Fleet also operates.

==Culture==
Gaeta has erected a monument to John Cabot, who discovered Canada in 1500. Other people associated with the town include the painters Giovanni da Gaeta and Giovanni Filippo Criscuolo. For a full list, see People from Gaeta.

Gaetans speak a dialect of Italian that, while similar to the nearby Neapolitan, is one of the few Italian dialects to preserve Latin&#x27;s neuter gender.

Distinctive local cuisine includes the tiella, which resembles both a pizza and a salty crostata. Tiella can be made with several stuffings. Typical stuffings include diced squids with parsley, garlic, oil, hot pepper and just enough tomatoes for colouring. Other stuffings include endives and baccalà (dried and salted cods), eggs and courgettes, spinaches, rapini and sausages, ham and cheese. The town is also known for its distinctive brand of olives, marketed throughout the world (the main production, however, takes place in neighbouring Itri), and its beaches (Serapo, Fontania, Ariana, Sant&#x27;Agostino). Sciuscielle, mostaccioli, susamelli, and roccocò are also local desserts most often made during Christmas time. A Latin text found in Gaeta dating from 997 AD contains the earliest known usage of the word &quot;pizza&quot;.

The most famous folklore event of Gaeta is &quot;Glie Sciusce&quot; of 31 December, in which bands of young Gaetani in traditional costumes head to the city&#x27;s streets, playing mainly self-built instruments.

==International relations==
Gaeta is twinned with:
* Cambridge, United States, since 1982
* Frontignan, France
* Mobile, United States
* Somerville, United States
* Cetinje, Montenegro, since 2012
* Babolsar, Iran, since 2016

<doc id="390606" wikidata="Q1570736" url="?curid=390606" title="List of world heavyweight boxing champions">
<text>At boxing&#x27;s beginning, the heavyweight division had no weight limit, and historically the weight class has gone with vague or no definition. During the 19th century many heavyweights were 170 pounds (12 st 2 lb, 77 kg) or less, though others weighed considerably more. John L. Sullivan was the first widely recognized champion under Marquess of Queensberry rules. Known as the &quot;Boston Strong Boy&quot;, Sullivan weighed around 200 pounds when in shape, and helped transition the sport from its bare-knuckle era. Sullivan would be defeated for the title by &quot;Gentleman&quot; Jim Corbett over 21 rounds on September 7, 1892, the first heavyweight titleholder solely under Queensberry rules.

In 1920, a de facto minimum weight for a heavyweight was set at 175 pounds (12 st 7 lb, 79 kg) with the standardization of a weight limit for the light heavyweight division. The addition of the cruiserweight division, which began in 1979, reset the de facto minimum, first to 190 pounds and then to 200 pounds in 2004 when boxing&#x27;s major sanctioning bodies universally raised the weight limit at which they would recognize champions. The World Boxing Council created a new division called bridgerweight for boxers weighing between 200 and 225 pounds. As of June 2022, no other major organization has recognized the division.

The championship of the heavyweight division has been fractured or disputed at various times in its history. Until the 1960s, such disputes were settled in the ring, typically with alternate title claimants largely being forgotten. The rise of sanctioning organizations, however, have produced an environment where typically there is no single world heavyweight champion, with titleholders recognized by one of these organizations (a &quot;World Champion&quot;) or more (a &quot;Super Champion&quot;, a &quot;Unified Champion&quot;, or, in the rare cases where the four most prominent organizations recognize the same boxer, an &quot;Undisputed Champion&quot;).

Some title reigns are considered dubious owing to long periods of inactivity, the legitimacy of the organization granting championship recognition, and other factors. In 1967, for example, Muhammad Ali was denied a boxing license in every U.S. jurisdiction and stripped of his passport because of his refusal to be inducted into the armed forces. On April 29, 1967, his recognition as champion by both the World Boxing Association and World Boxing Council was withdrawn. Yet Ali remained the lineal champion and was recognized by &quot;The Ring&quot; and most boxing purists until his defeat in 1971. In pursuit of greater revenues, some organizations have now adopted a practice of simultaneously recognizing multiple champions in a weight division, creating a situation in which a champion may be unable not only to secure recognition from multiple sanctioning bodies but to secure sole recognition from a single one.

==Championship recognition==
===Public acclamation: 1884 to 1921===
World champions were initially recognized by wide public acclamation, with heavyweight champions winning and losing championship recognition solely in the ring. Retirements periodically resulted in no one, true champion being recognized, while in other cases new champions were proclaimed only to see a previously recognized champion come out of retirement. Public interest in boxing resulted in a true champion being determined by means of title claimants facing one another in the ring, with the winner being recognized as world champion.

===&quot;The Ring&quot; magazine: 1922 to present ===
&quot;The Ring&quot; has recognized heavyweight champions during two periods, commencing with its inaugural issue in 1922 and continuing until the 1990s, then again from 2002 to the present day. Under its original policy, a champion earned championship recognition in the ring, defeating the preceding champion or winning a bout between its top rated contenders. Once awarded, championship recognition could be lost only by death, retirement, or loss in the ring. In 2012, this policy was revised so championship recognition could be more easily awarded or withdrawn.

===Sanctioning bodies: 1921 to present ===
The National Boxing Association (NBA) was organized in 1921 to serve as a regulating authority for boxing in the United States. The prominence of New York City as the epicenter of boxing would lead to its state boxing regulatory body, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) joining the NBA in recognizing world champions in each weight class. A third entity, the European Boxing Union (IBU) would follow suit, but with limited exception in the heavyweight division the three organizations recognized the same champion.

At its 1962 convention, the NBA&#x27;s non-United States members exploited a membership rule and took effective control of the organization, rebranding it as the World Boxing Association. The now WBA would be joined the following year by a combination of state and national boxing commissions (including the NYSAC and IBU) to form a new organization, the World Boxing Council (WBC). In time, each organization would have its own spin-off sanctioning organization break from its ranks: the United States Boxing Association, which disassociated with the WBA in the late 1970s and became the International Boxing Federation in 1983, and the World Boxing Organization, whose members would split from the WBC in 1988. Today there are over a dozen sanctioning organizations which recognize champions and sanction world championship bouts, but the WBA, WBC, IBF, and WBO are recognized by the International Boxing Hall Of Fame as major sanctioning bodies.

==Current status of championships==
==List of champions==

===Footnotes===

# Won vacant championship title.
# Voluntarily relinquished championship title.
# Championship recognition withdrawn by sanctioning organization upon his refusal to fight an opponent of the organization&#x27;s designation
# In 1882, Sullivan defeated Paddy Ryan to win the bare-knuckle championship of America. A lack of legitimate challengers elsewhere gradually resulted in Sullivan earning worldwide recognition. On August 29, 1885, he defeated Dominick McCaffrey in a bout described as &quot;the Marquess of Queensberry glove contest for the championship of the world.&quot;
# Corbett announced his retirement from boxing in 1895, nominating Steve O&#x27;Donnell as his successor. As tradition demanded the title be won in the ring, O&#x27;Donnell was matched against Peter Maher on November 11, 1895, at Maspeth, New York. Maher won via first-round knockout, but the public generally didn&#x27;t accept Maher and Maher himself expressed a desire to fight Corbett for the &quot;real&quot; title. In Maher&#x27;s next bout, Bob Fitzsimmons defeated him via first-round knockout on February 21, 1896. Fitzsimmons in turn was defeated by Tom Sharkey of Dundalk on December 2, 1896, in a contest billed as for the heavyweight title. Corbett announced his return to the ring shortly thereafter, at which time the championship claims of Maher, Fitzsimmons, and Sharkey were for the most part dismissed. Sharkey&#x27;s title claims lapsed when he was defeated by Jeffries in May 1898.
# Jeffries announced his retirement, relinquishing the title and promoting a match between Marvin Hart and Jack Root for the championship. Jeffries returned to the ring to challenge Jack Johnson.
# The British National Sporting Club withdrew its recognition of Johnson as champion when he refused to defend his title against the British champion William &quot;Iron&quot; Hague. The NSC matched Hague with Canadian Sam Langford for its title on May 24, 1909. Langford won via fourth-round knockout but never pursued a championship claim.
# Schmeling earned championship recognition by defeating Jack Sharkey by controversial disqualification. The New York State Athletic Commission withdrew its recognition of Schmeling when he refused to grant Sharkey an immediate rematch. The NYSAC did not recognize a champion until Sharkey defeated Schmeling in 1932.
# In late 1934, the International Boxing Union (IBU) ordered Baer to defend his title against European champion Pierre Charles of Belgium. When Baer refused, the IBU sanctioned a bout between Charles and American George Godfrey for their title on October 2, 1935. Godfrey won via fifteen-round decision but never pursued a championship claim. The IBU ultimately recognized Baer&#x27;s successor James J. Braddock as champion.
# Two months after Louis&#x27; retirement announcement, the International Boxing Union sanctioned a bout between British champion Bruce Woodcock and American Lee Savold for its version of the title. The bout was not staged until June 1950, however, due to delays caused by injuries suffered by Woodcock in an automobile accident. Meanwhile, Ezzard Charles defeated Jersey Joe Walcott to win the vacant National Boxing Association championship title. Savold defeated Woodcock in four rounds to win the IBU title, while Charles gained New York State Athletic Commission recognition and wide public acclaim as champion upon defeating former champion Joe Louis in September 1950. On June 15, 1951, Joe Louis defeated Savold via sixth-round knockout, after which the IBU withdrew its recognition of Savold and proclaimed Ezzard Charles as champion.
# Following Marciano&#x27;s retirement, Patterson was matched against Tommy &quot;Hurricane&quot; Jackson in a championship eliminator on June 8, 1956. Winning via controversial split decision, Patterson then faced light heavyweight titleholder Archie Moore for the vacant title. Upon defeating Moore, Patterson fought (and defeated) Jackson a second time on July 29, 1957.
# The World Boxing Association withdrew their championship recognition of Clay (by then known as Muhammad Ali) upon agreeing to an immediate rematch against former champion Sonny Liston, in violation of WBA rules. The newly founded World Boxing Council and other sanctioning groups continued to recognize Ali as champion.
# The World Boxing Association, World Boxing Council, New York State Athletic Commission and others withdrew their championship recognition of Ali following his refusal to be inducted into the United States Army subsequent to his conscription.
# To fill its vacant championship title, the World Boxing Association organized a single-elimination tournament involving eight of their ranked contenders (Joe Frazier, who was ranked No. 2, declined to participate): Oscar Bonavena, Jimmy Ellis, Leotis Martin, Karl Mildenberger, two-time former champion Floyd Patterson, Jerry Quarry, Thad Spencer, and former WBA champion Ernie Terrell. In first round matches, Ellis defeated Martin, Quarry defeated Patterson, Spencer defeated Terrell, and Bonavena defeated Mildenberger. In the semi-finals, Ellis defeated Bonavena while Quarry defeated Spencer; and Ellis defeated Quarry for the championship title. Frazier, meanwhile, was matched against Buster Mathis for a championship recognized by the New York State Athletic Commission together with the commissions of Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Similar &quot;world&quot; championship recognition was bestowed upon him by the Texas Athletic Commission following a victory over Dave Zyglewicz on April 22, 1969.
# Frazier defeated Ellis to unify the heavyweight championship, but did not gain World public acclaim as champion until defeating Muhammad Ali on March 8, 1971.
# In an unprecedented move, upon withdrawing its recognition of Leon Spinks as champion, the World Boxing Council immediately recognized Ken Norton as champion, based on an earlier victory over Jimmy Young. As a condition of being named champion, Norton was ordered to face the WBC&#x27;s new mandatory challenger, Larry Holmes within 120 days.
# Holmes relinquished his World Boxing Council championship and accepted championship recognition bestowed by the newly organized International Boxing Federation.
# Following its 1978 precedent, upon withdrawing championship recognition from Riddick Bowe, the World Boxing Council immediately awarded championship recognition to Lennox Lewis, on the basis of his victory in an October 31, 1992 &quot;championship eliminator&quot; over Donovan Ruddock.
# Following its withdrawal of recognition from George Foreman, the International Boxing Federation sanctioned a December 9, 1995, match between Francois Botha and Axel Schulz for its championship. Botha won the bout by split decision, but the bout result and Botha&#x27;s championship title were vacated after Botha&#x27;s post-fight drug test revealed he had taken illegal anabolic steroids. A subsequent bout between Schulz and Michael Moorer was sanctioned for the IBF championship.
# Upon defeating John Ruiz, Roy Jones Jr. simultaneously held the World Boxing Association&#x27;s heavyweight and light heavyweight titles. At his request, the WBA suspended its rule prohibiting simultaneous title holding. It later declared Jones its &quot;Champion in Recess,&quot; and sanctioned a December 13, 2003, bout between Ruiz and Hasim Rahman for its &quot;interim&quot; championship. Ruiz won the bout. On February 20, 2004, Jones relinquished his heavyweight title to resume boxing as a light heavyweight, at which point Ruiz was elevated to full championship recognition. On April 30, 2005, Ruiz was defeated by James Toney in a championship defense, but post-fight drug testing determined Toney had taken Nandrolone, an anabolic steroid. The bout&#x27;s result was subsequently changed to a &quot;no contest,&quot; whereupon the WBA reinstated Ruiz as champion.
# Following repeated injuries to champion Vitali Klitschko, the World Boxing Council sanctioned an August 13, 2005, bout between Hasim Rahman and Monte Barrett for its &quot;interim&quot; championship. Rahman won the bout, and when Klitschko relinquished his title three months later, the WBC elevated Rahman to full championship recognition.
# Following repeated injuries which prevented him from defending his title, the World Boxing Association designated Chagaev a &quot;Champion in Recess,&quot; sanctioning an August 30, 2008 bout between former champions John Ruiz and Nikolai Valuev for its primary title; a bout won by Valuev. Upon his recovery however, Chagaev opted to face Wladimir Klitschko rather than Valuev, whereupon the WBA withdrew the &quot;Champion in Recess&quot; status.
# The World Boxing Association modified its championship structure, creating a new &quot;Super Champion&quot; status to be awarded to champions who hold multiple titles simultaneously. Now subordinated to this was the status of &quot;World Champion,&quot; commonly referred to as the &quot;Regular&quot; champion. The organization then sanctioned a bout between Povetkin and former champion Ruslan Chagaev for this &quot;regular&quot; title. Povetkin&#x27;s reign as the WBA&#x27;s &quot;regular champion&quot; ended upon a loss to &quot;Super Champion&quot; Wladimir Klitschko, at which point the &quot;regular&quot; title was vacant.
# Browne defeated Ruslan Chagaev for the World Boxing Association&#x27;s &quot;regular&quot; championship title, but Browne subsequently tested positive for Clenbuterol, a banned substance. Following confirmation of the positive result, the WBA withdrew its recognition of Browne&#x27;s &quot;regular&quot; championship.
# On October 29, 1877, a fight between British fighters Tom Allen and Tompkin Gilbert at the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, London was billed as for the World heavyweight title under Marquess of Queensberry Rules. Allen won in seven rounds.
# Bryan was due to fight Mahmoud Charr on January 29, 2021, for the WBA Regular championship, but Charr was unable to attain the right visa to come to the US, where the fight was to be held. Due to the long period of inactivity, Charr was stripped of the title and Bryan fought Bermane Stiverne for the now vacant title instead.

<doc id="390607" wikidata="Q38838" url="?curid=390607" title="List of municipalities in Washington">
<text>Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. As of the 2020 U.S. census, it is the 13th-most populous state, with inhabitants, and ranked 18th by land area, spanning of land. Washington is divided into 39 counties and contains 281 municipalities that are classified into cities and towns. Approximately of the state&#x27;s population lives in incorporated municipalities.

The most populous municipality in Washington is Seattle with 737,015 residents, and the least populous municipality is Krupp with 49 residents. The state has ten cities with populations greater than 100,000 residents and sixteen with populations between 50,000 and 100,000 residents; the majority of cities have fewer than 5,000 residents. Seattle is also the largest municipality by land area, at , while Beaux Arts Village is the smallest at ; both are located in King County. The oldest municipality is Steilacoom, which was incorporated in 1854; the most recent municipality to incorporate was Spokane Valley in 2003. Five municipalities have also been disincorporated with their governments dissolved; the most recent was Westlake in 1966.

The state has five categories for its 281 municipalities that vary based on population at the time of incorporation or reorganization. , 197 are code cities, 10 are first-class cities, 5 are second-class cities, and 69 are towns; one city remains unclassified. All municipalities have an elected city or town council and an executive—either a mayor or manager—to oversee administration of the government. The municipal government generally provides some emergency services, a court system, road maintenance, planning and permitting, parks and recreation, and some utilities.

==Classification of municipalities==
There are four classifications for municipalities in the state of Washington: code city, first-class city, second-class city, and town. Municipalities can also be unclassified if they did not organize under these classifications. Each has their own powers and limitations that vary and are defined by state laws in Titles 35 and 35A of the Revised Code of Washington. These powers include the ability to collect general taxes to fund municipal services and specialized taxes for specific uses; providing emergency services, urban planning, and water treatment among other services; and enforce laws passed by the city council. After Washington was admitted as a U.S. state in 1889, the state legislature created classifications for local municipalities, each with a population threshold. First-class and code cities with populations greater than 10,000 are authorized under the state constitution to adopt a charter that grants home rule powers at the local level.

, Washington has ten first-class cities that are permitted to adopt and operate under a home rule charter; they are required to have a population of at least 10,000 residents at the time of their incorporation or reorganization. The state has five second-class cities that have limited authority and can only use powers granted by the state legislature; they are required to have at least 1,500 residents at the time of their incorporation or reorganization. There are 68 towns that also have a limited authority and had fewer than 1,500 residents at the time of their incorporation or reorganization. In 1994, the minimum population to incorporate a municipality was raised from 300 to 1,500 by the state legislature, which has prevented the creation of new towns.

The state legislature created another classification—the code city—in 1967 to grant greater control to cities, who sought expanded home rule authority to address complex issues as they urbanized. , the state has 197 municipalities that are code cities—the most of any classification. They are authorized to perform any function not specifically restricted in the state constitution or by state law. Any area with 1,500 residents is allowed to incorporate as a code city, and any code city with at least 10,000 residents are allowed to adopt a charter. Existing cities and towns are allowed to reorganize as a code city if they meet the population threshold and the change is approved by voters. , one city remains unclassified—Waitsburg, in Walla Walla County—and continues to use the 1881 territorial charter under which it was organized. It is allowed to exercise the powers of a code city under a 2003 law passed by the state legislature.

Non-charter cities and towns are authorized to adopt one of three forms of government for day-to-day municipal operations: commission, mayor–council, council–manager. The most common form is mayor–council, which has an elected mayor who takes office separately from the elected city council. The council–manager form is used by some municipalities and has a hired city manager as the chief executive of the government, while the mayor holds a ceremonial role and presides over city council meetings. , a total of the 227 municipalities that use a mayor–council system comprise 58percent of Washington residents in incorporated areas; the 54 municipalities that use a council–manager system, which are all code and first-class cities, comprise 42percent of residents in incorporated areas. The city commission system—which assigns its three elected commissioners as the heads of municipal departments—was last used by Shelton in 2017 and not adopted by another municipality.

<text>Yamam (), also known as National Counter-Terrorism Unit, is Israel&#x27;s national counter-terrorism unit, one of four special units of the Israel Border Police. The Yamam is capable of both hostage-rescue operations and offensive take-over raids against terrorist targets in civilian areas. Besides military and counter-terrorism duties, it also performs tactical unit duties and undercover police work.

==History==
The Yamam was established in late 1974 after the Ma&#x27;alot massacre, where a failed rescue operation by the Sayeret Matkal commando unit of the Israel Defense Forces resulted in the murder of 21 schoolchildren before the hostage takers were killed. Since hostage rescue tactics in friendly territory differ from those used in hostile areas, it was decided to establish an elite police unit which develops and practices a special CQB (Close Quarters Battles) doctrine for counter-terrorism operations in friendly territory and hostage rescue.

===Operational record after the Second Intifada===
On May 23, 2006, a Yamam force, using intelligence provided by the Shin-Bet, arrested Ibrahim Hamed after an IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozer started ramming the house in which he was hiding.
On September 23, 2014, a Yamam force, together with Israel Defense Forces Combat Engineering Corps bulldozers, killed the two Hamas members accused of killing three Israeli teens in June 2014.

===Operational record during Operation Breakwater (2022–2023) ===

On April 2, 2022, YAMAM operators killed 3 Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants, reportedly on their way to an attack.
On August 19, 2022, YAMAM operators killed Ibrahim al-Nabulsi, a commander of the Lions&#x27; Den militant group.
On October 25, 2022, YAMAM led a combined raid (with the Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet) on what the IDF said was the Lions&#x27; Den headquarters and bomb lab in Nablus.
On January 26, 2023, YAMAM led a combined raid (with the Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet) on Jenin refugee camp, which the IDF said was targeted against members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad who were planning an attack. Nine Palestinians were killed in the attack, including an unarmed civilian.

=== Operational record during the Hamas led-attack on October 7, 2023, and afterwards ===

On October 7, 2023, YAMAM forces were the first to respond to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and the numerous massacres conducted by Palestinians in Israeli communities and towns. YAMAM operators killed in combat 200 armed Hamas gunmen and conducted several hostage rescue operations. YAMAM lost 9 operators and officers who were killed in action.

On February 12, 2024, YAMAM rescued two Israeli hostages in Rafah, together with the Shin Bet and the Israeli Defense Forces, in a military covert raid code-named Operation Golden Hand.

On June 8, 2024, YAMAM rescued four hostages in the Nuseirat Refugee Camp, together with the Shin Bet and the Israeli Defense Forces, in Operation Arnon. During the operation, Squad Commander Arnon Zamora, 36, was killed in combat. Noa Argamani, an Israeli citizen kidnapped in the Re&#x27;im Music festival massacre, was rescued in the operation. During the operation, according to the IDF, under 100 Palestinians were killed. According to Hamas, 210 were killed.
==Selection and training==
Yamam recruits veterans of Israel Defense Forces and Israel Border Police combat units who completed their compulsory service. Applicants must have served in a regular IDF combat unit and completed a commander&#x27;s course (Rifleman 08), served in an IDF special forces unit, or served in a Border Police Mista&#x27;arvim unit. The unit&#x27;s training course lasts seven months, divided into three months of basic counter-terrorism training during which recruits go through basic combat training, as well as training in hand-to-hand combat, urban combat, and use of specialized weapons, followed by four months of advanced training.

==Honors==
The unit received number of honor citations (TZALASH, ציון לשבח) from the Commissioner of the Israeli Police: 2011, 2014, 2016, 2020, and 2022.

In 2022 the unit received an honor citation from the Israel Defense Forces Chief of the General Staff (צל&quot;ש הרמטכ&quot;ל) for their fighting during Operation Breakwater.

<text>The Volturno (ancient Latin name Volturnus, from &quot;volvere&quot;, to roll) is a river in south-central Italy.

==Geography==
It rises in the Abruzzese central Apennines of Samnium near Castel San Vincenzo (province of Isernia, Molise) and flows southeast as far as its junction with the Calore Irpino near Caiazzo and runs south as far as Venafro, and then turns southwest, past Capua, to enter the Tyrrhenian Sea in Castel Volturno, northwest of Naples. The river is long.

After a course of some it receives, about east of Caiazzo, the Calore River. The united stream now flows west-southwest past Capua, where the Via Appia and Latina joined just to the north of the bridge over it, and so through the Campanian plain, with many windings, into the sea. The direct length of the lower course is about , so that the whole is slightly longer than that of the Liri-Garigliano, and its basin far larger.

Its main tributaries are San Bartolomeo, Lete, Torano, Rivo Tella, Titerno, Calore Irpino and Isclero.

==History==
The river has always had a considerable military importance, and the colony of Volturnum (no doubt preceded by an older, possibly even Etruscan, port of Capua) was founded in 194 BC at its mouth on the south bank by the Romans; it is now about one mile inland. A fort had already been placed there during the Roman siege of Capua to serve, with Puteoli, for the provisioning of the army. Augustus placed a colony of veterans here. The Via Domitiana from Sinuessa to Puteoli crossed the river at this point, and some remains of the bridge are visible. The river was navigable as far as Capua.

In 554, the Byzantine general Narses defeated a Frankish-Alamannic army near this river, during the Gothic War.

Following the invasion of southern Italy by revolutionary forces led by Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1860, Francis II of the Two Sicilies fled from Naples and took up a defensive position on the south bank of the Volturno, near S. Maria di Capua Vetere. The Piedmontese troops and those of Garibaldi inflicted on the Neapolitan forces at the battle of the Volturno, on 1 and 2 October, a defeat which led to the fall of Capua.

The Volturno also gave its name to the Volturno Line, a German defensive position in Italy during World War II.

<doc id="390612" wikidata="Q801296" url="?curid=390612" title="Okachimachi Station">
<text>is a railway station in Taito, Tokyo, Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East).

==Lines==
Okachimachi Station is served by the circular Yamanote Line and also the Keihin-Tohoku Line. Although not physically connected, on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line, on the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, and on the Toei Oedo Line are within walking distance of Okachimachi and marked as interchanges on route maps.

==Station layout==

The station is on a raised viaduct running in a roughly north-south direction. There are two exits, the and . Both exits have ticket vending machines and toilets; however, the north exit has a &quot;Midori no Madoguchi&quot; staffed ticket office and escalators to the platforms. Luggage lockers are available at the south exit.

===Platforms===
The station has two island platforms with two tracks on either side of each platform. Platforms 1 and 4 (the outermost tracks) serve the Keihin-Tohoku Line, while platforms 2 and 3 (the inner tracks) are used for Yamanote Line trains. This platform arrangement allows for easy cross-platform interchanges so that passengers may transfer between lines in the same direction by walking across the platform.

East of the platforms lie tracks of the Ueno-Tokyo Line. These are themselves built on former tracks of the Tohoku Main Line running to Tokyo Station, that had been used for stabling trains when construction of the Tohoku Shinkansen took over land near Kanda Station previously used by the Tohoku Main Line, forcing services to terminate at Ueno Station instead.


The Yamanote Line platforms are equipped with chest-high platform edge doors, installed in March 2014.

==History==
The station opened on 1 November 1925. Waist-high platform edge doors were installed on the Yamanote Line platforms in March 2014, scheduled to be brought into operation from 10 May. From 14 March 2015, rapid services on the Keihin-Tohoku Line began serving the station on weekends and national holidays only.

Station numbering was introduced in 2016 with Okachimachi being assigned station numbers JY04 for the Yamanote line and JK29 for the Keihin-Tōhoku line.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the station was used by an average of 67,593 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the 64th-busiest station operated by JR East. The daily average passenger figures (boarding passengers only) in previous years are as shown below.

==Surrounding area==
Okachimachi Station is in the centre of a busy commercial district stretching southwards from Ueno Station. Particularly well-known is Ameya-Yokochō (&quot;Ameyoko&quot;), a busy shopping street dominated by small market-style stalls selling a wide variety of wares. Ameyoko runs parallel to the railway line and includes a large market under the railway tracks.

The station is also very near Ueno Park&#x27;s south entrance.

<text>Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg () is the second borough of Berlin, formed in 2001 by merging the former East Berlin borough of Friedrichshain and the former West Berlin borough of Kreuzberg. The historic Oberbaum Bridge, formerly a Berlin border crossing for pedestrians, links both districts across the river Spree as the new borough&#x27;s landmark (as featured in the coat of arms).
The counterculture tradition especially of Kreuzberg has led to the borough being a stronghold for the Green Party. While Kreuzberg is characterised by a high number of immigrants, the share of non-German citizens in Friedrichshain is much lower and the average age is higher. The merger between the distinct quarters is celebrated by an annual anarchic &quot;vegetable fight&quot; on the Oberbaumbrücke. Both parts have to deal with the consequences of gentrification.

==History==
The Berlin district of Kreuzberg-Friedrichshain has a rich and complex history that reflects the city&#x27;s changing political and cultural landscape over the past two centuries.

Located in the heart of the city, Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain were once separate neighborhoods that were united into a single district in 2001. The area is known for its diverse and vibrant cultural scene, as well as its history as a center of political activism and counterculture.

Kreuzberg has a long history as a working-class neighborhood and was heavily damaged during World War II. After the war, the area became home to many immigrants, including Turkish and other migrants from the Middle East and Europe. In the 1970s and 1980s, Kreuzberg became a center of political activism and alternative culture, with a large youth and student population.
Friedrichshain, on the other hand, has a more diverse history. It was originally a working-class neighborhood, but was heavily bombed during World War II and then divided by the Berlin Wall after the war. After the fall of the Wall in 1989, Friedrichshain underwent a process of gentrification and became a popular neighborhood for artists, students, and young professionals.
In recent years, both Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain have become popular tourist destinations, known for their lively streets, diverse cultural scene, and rich history.

==Subdivision==
Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg is divided into 2 localities, Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg.

==Politics==
===District council===
The governing body of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg is the district council (&quot;Bezirksverordnetenversammlung&quot;). It has responsibility for passing laws and electing the city government, including the mayor. The most recent district council election was held on 26 September 2021, and the results were as follows:

<text>Kebab ( , ), kebap, (North American) kabob, kebob, or (Kashmiri) kabab, is a variety of roasted meat dishes that originated in the Middle East.

Kebabs consist of cut up ground meat, sometimes with vegetables and various other accompaniments according to the specific recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are oven-baked in a pan, or prepared as a stew such as &quot;tas kebab&quot;. The traditional meat for kebabs is most often lamb meat, but regional recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish, or even pork (depending on whether or not there are specific religious prohibitions).

==Etymology==
The word kebab has ancient origins. It was popularized in the West by Turks to refer to a range of grilled and broiled meat, which may be cooked on skewers, including stews, meatballs, and many other forms.

The word likely came to English in the late 17th century from the Persian , partly through Hindustani, and Turkish. According to linguist Sevan Nişanyan, the Turkish word is also derived from the Persian word , meaning roasted meat, and according to the Turkish Language Association it is from . It appears in Turkish texts as early as the 14th century, in (), though still in the Persian form. Nişanyan states that the word has the equivalent meaning of &#x27;frying, burning&#x27; with in the old Akkadian language, and in Aramaic. In contrast, food historian Gil Marks says that the medieval Arabic and Turkish terms were adopted from the Persian &quot;kabab&quot;, which probably derived from the Aramaic.

The American Heritage Dictionary also gives a probable East Semitic root origin with the meaning of &#x27;burn&#x27;, &#x27;char&#x27;, or &#x27;roast&#x27;, from the Aramaic and Akkadian. The Babylonian Talmud instructs that Temple offerings not be (burned). These words point to an origin in the prehistoric Proto-Afroasiatic language: &quot;*kab-&quot;, to burn or roast.

==History==
While the word &quot;kebab&quot; or &quot;shish kebab&quot; may sometimes be used in English as a culinary term that refers to any type of small chunks of meat cooked on a skewer, &quot;kebab&quot; is mainly associated with a diversity of meat dishes that originated in Persia and Anatolia.

In Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq&#x27;s 10th-century Baghdadi cookbook (), a compendium of much of the legacy of Mesopotamian, Persian, and Arab cuisines, there are descriptions of as cut-up meat, either fried in a pan or grilled over a fire.

This cuisine has spread around the world, in parallel with Muslim influence. According to Ibn Battuta, a Maghrebi traveller, kebab was served in the royal houses during the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526), and even commoners would enjoy it for breakfast with naan. Kebab dishes have been adopted and integrated with local cooking styles and innovations, from the now-ubiquitous doner kebab fast food, to the many variations of shish kebab, such as the satays of Southeast Asia.

==Varieties by region==
In most English-speaking countries, a &quot;kebab&quot; may be the classic shish kebab or souvlaki – small cubes of meat cooked on a skewer – or made with minced (ground) meat, as in doner kebab. By contrast, in Indian English, Bangladeshi English, Pakistani English and in the languages of the Middle East, other parts of Asia, and the Muslim world, a &quot;kebab&quot; is any of a wide variety of grilled meat dishes. Some dishes ultimately derived from Middle Eastern kebab may have different names in their local languages, such as the Chinese &quot;chuan&quot;.

===East Asia===
====China====
Chuan (), often referred to as &quot;chuan&quot; in Mandarin throughout the north, or kawap (كاۋاپ) in Uyghur, is a variation of kebab originating from the Uyghur people in the western province of Xinjiang and a popular dish in Chinese Islamic cuisine. The dish has since spread across the rest of the country and become a popular street food.

Although the most traditional form of chuan uses lamb or mutton, other types of meat, such as chicken, beef, pork, and seafood, may be used as well. Small pieces of meat are skewered and either roasted or deep-fried. Common spices and condiments include cumin called &quot;ziran&quot;, pepper, sesame, and sesame oil.

===Europe===
====Greece====
While the history of street foods in Greece goes back to ancient times, the iconic Greek &quot;gyros&quot; and &quot;souvlaki&quot; as it is known today arose only following the Second World War. Introduced to Athens in the 1950s by Greek refugees from Turkey and the Middle East, gyros was originally known simply as &quot;döner kebab&quot;. It is typically served as a sandwich rolled in pita bread, or on a plate, with french fries and various salads and sauces such as tzatziki. Later in the 1960s, vendors also began selling dishes in the same style made with souvlaki, which resembles Turkish shish kebab, but is usually made with pork.

Around the same time, the Greek word &quot;gyros&quot; replaced &quot;döner kebab&quot;, and the Greek style of the dish spread to become popular, particularly in North America, and various other parts of the world.

In contrast to other areas of Greece, in Athens, both types of sandwich may be called &quot;souvlaki&quot;, with the skewered meat being called &quot;kalamaki&quot;.

Although gyros is unquestionably of Middle Eastern origin, the issue of whether modern-day souvlaki came to Greece via Turkish cuisine, and should be considered a Greek styling of shish kebab, or is a contemporary revival of Greek tradition dating as far back as 17th century BC Minoan civilization, is a topic of sometimes heated debate, at least between Greeks and Turks. While English speakers may refer to souvlaki skewers as kebabs, they are not properly called that in Greece.

===West Asia and North Africa===
====South Caucasus====

Both Armenian and Azerbaijani cuisine feature oblong kofta-style mincemeats kebabs known as &quot;lula or lyulya kebab&quot;, while 
Armenian cuisine refers to shish-style kebabs as &quot;khorovats&quot;, and doner kebab as &quot;Karsi khorovats&quot; after the city of Kars which became known for the dish during the time of the Ottoman Empire.

====Iran====
There are several distinct Persian varieties of kabab (). Kabab may be served with either steamed, saffroned basmati or Persian rice and called &quot;chelow kabab&quot; (), which is considered the national dish of Iran. It may also be served with the various types of bread that are the most commonly eaten in Iran, such as lavash.

It is served with the basic Iranian meal accompaniments, in addition to grilled tomatoes on the side of the rice and butter on top of the rice. It is an old northern tradition (probably originating in Tehran) that a raw egg yolk should be placed on top of the rice as well, though this is strictly optional, and most restaurants will not serve the rice this way unless it is specifically requested. &quot;Somagh&quot;, powdered sumac, is also made available and its use varies based on tastes to a small dash on the rice or a heavy sprinkling on both rice and meat, particularly when used with red (beef/veal/lamb) meat.

At Persian restaurants, the combination of one kabab barg and one kabab koobideh is typically called &quot;Soltani&quot;, meaning &quot;sultan&#x27;s feast&quot;. The combination of one kabab barg, one jujeh kabab and kabab koobideh is typically called &quot;Shah abbasi&quot;, meaning &quot;Shah Abbas&#x27; meal&quot;. The traditional beverage of choice to accompany Persian kabab is doogh, a sour yogurt drink with mint and salt.

In the old bazaar tradition, the rice (which is covered with a tin lid) and accompaniments are served first, immediately followed by the kababs, which are brought to the table by the waiter, who holds several skewers in his left hand, and a piece of flat bread (typically nan-e lavash) in his right. A skewer is placed directly on the rice and while holding the kebab down on the rice with the bread, the skewer is quickly pulled out. With the two most common kababs, barg and koobideh, two skewers are always served. In general, bazaar kabab restaurants only serve these two varieties, though there are exceptions.

In Iranian Azerbaijan, &quot;Binab (also Bonab) Kababi&quot; is very famous in Iranian Azerbaijani local cuisine for its large size. It is named after the city of Binab in East Azerbaijan province. This kabab and other types (e.g., Shishlik, Kubide, Berge, Gelin, etc.) can be served alone or with rice and fresh salad on the side. In this region Kababs come usually with yogurt, hot bread, tomato, onion, parsley and paprika-salt, and tarragon.
Kabab koobideh () it kūbide () is an Iranian minced meat kabab which is made from ground lamb, beef, or chicken, often mixed with parsley and chopped onions.

Kabab Koobideh contains: ground meat, onion, salt, pepper, turmeric, and seasoning. These ingredients are mixed together until the mixture becomes smooth and sticky. One egg is added to help the mix stick together. The mixture is then pressed around a skewer. Koobideh Kabab is typically long.

Kabāb-e Barg () is a Persian style barbecued lamb, chicken or beef kabab dish. The main ingredients of &quot;Kabab Barg&quot; – a short form of this name – are fillets of beef tenderloin, lamb shank or chicken breast, onions and olive oil.

Marinade is prepared by the mixture of half a cup of olive oil, three onions, garlic, half teaspoon saffron, salt and black pepper. One kilogram of lamb is cut into 1 cm thick and 4–5 cm long pieces. It should be marinated overnight in refrigerator, and the container should be covered. The next day, the lamb is threaded on long, thin metal skewers. It is brushed with marinade and is barbecued for 5–10 minutes on each side.

Jūjeh Kabāb () consists of pieces of chicken first marinated in minced onion and lemon juice with saffron then grilled over a fire. It is sometimes served with grilled tomato and pepper. Jujeh Kabab is one of the most popular Persian dishes.

Kabab Bakhtiari is a combination of Jujeh kabab (chicken kabab) and Kabab barg (beef or lamb meat) on the same skewer. Its name comes from the Bakhtiari region of Iran.

Kabab Kenjeh, also known as Chenjeh (, ) is a kabab traditionally made with chunks of marinated lamb meat. It is typically served with grilled tomatoes and rice or bread.

Kabab Torsh is an Iranian Kabab from the northern provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran, renowned for its sour, pomegranate based seasoning.

Kabab Lari, Kabab Tabei (Pan Kabab), Dande Kabab, Kabab Shandiz, Shishlik Kabab, Kabab Ghafghazi, Kabab Soltani, Kabob Vaziri, Kabob Loghmeh, Taas Kabab, Mahi Kabab (Fish Kabab) and Kabab Jegar (Sheep Liver Kaba) are among other types of Persian Kababs popular in Iran.

====Iraq====

Several types of kebab are popular in Iraqi cuisine, although the word kebab in local use is reserved for skewers of spiced ground lamb, traditionally grilled on natural wood charcoal to give the kebab its special flavor. Skewers of grilled marinated meat chunks are called tikka.

====The Levant====
Several varieties of kebabs can be found in Levantine cuisine. Among the most common are shish taouk, which are grilled chicken skewers marinated in olive oil and spices, and &quot;lahem meshwi&quot;, charcoal-grilled skewers of prime lamb cubes lightly seasoned with herbs.

The Syrian city of Aleppo is said to have at least twenty-six versions of kebab halabi or Aleppo kebab, including kebab cooked with cherries; with aubergine; with chili, parsley and pine-nuts; and with truffles.

Mizrahi Jews brought various types of grilled meat from their native Middle Eastern countries to Israel, where they have become an essential part of Israeli cuisine. Among the most popular are skewers of elongated spiced ground meat, called kabab (), which have become a staple dish of meat restaurants and the main dish of the traditional holiday barbecues, alongside the shishlik. They are commonly made of beef, though lamb is also occasionally used, and are almost always served with the local pita bread.

Shawarma, although not considered a kebab in most countries of the Levant, is another very popular type of grilled meat preparation that characterizes this region.

====Egypt====
Several varieties of kebab are popular in Egyptian cuisine, although the word kebab in local use is reserved for skewers of grilled marinated meat chunks. Skewers of grilled seasoned ground meat are called kofta. Shish taouk, which are skewers of grilled marinated chicken chunks, are another popular variety of kebab in Egypt. All kebabs are grilled on charcoal to give them their special flavor.

====Turkey====


* Adana kebap (or kıyma kebabı) is a long, hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled over charcoal. Named after the Turkish city of Adana, the kebab is generally &quot;hot&quot; or piquant. The traditional Adana kebab is made using lamb, with a high fatty content cooked over hot coals. Only three ingredients are used in a proper Adana kebab, minced lamb, red capsicum (pepper) and salt.
* &quot;Ali Paşa kebabı&quot;, &quot;Ali Pasha kebab&quot; – cubed lamb with tomato, onion and parsley wrapped in phyllo.
* &quot;Alinazik&quot; – Ground meat kebab sautéed in a saucepan, with garlic, yogurt and eggplants added.
* &quot;Beyti kebap&quot; – Ground lamb or beef, seasoned and grilled on a skewer, often served wrapped in lavash and topped with tomato sauce and yogurt, traced back to the famous kebab house Beyti in Istanbul and particularly popular in Turkey&#x27;s larger cities.
* &quot;Bostan kebabı&quot; – Lamb and aubergine casserole.

====Afghanistan====
Afghan kebab (Pashto/Dari: کباب) is most often found in restaurants and outdoor vendor stalls. The most widely used meat is lamb. Recipes differ with every restaurant. In Afghan cuisine, kebab is served with naan, rarely rice, and customers have the option to sprinkle sumac or &quot;ghora&quot;, dried ground sour grapes, on their kebab. The quality of kebab is solely dependent on the quality of the meat. Pieces of fat from the sheep&#x27;s tail (jijeq) are usually added with the lamb skewers to add extra flavor.

Other popular kebabs include the lamb chop, ribs, beef, buffalo, and chicken.

Chapli kebab, a specialty of Eastern Afghanistan, is a patty made from beef mince. It is prepared flat and round, and served with naan. The original recipe of chapli kebab dictates a half meat (or less), half flour mixture, which renders it lighter in taste and less expensive.

====Bangladesh====
In Bangladesh they make variations of kebab (Bengali কাবাব or &quot;Kabab&quot;). In the old Mughal province of Bengal Subah&#x27;s capital of Dhaka, various Pakistani and Indian-influenced dishes started to be made. Amongst these were kebabs. In Bangladeshi cuisine, most kebabs are made using fish or beef.

====India====

Modern-day kebabs in India mostly trace their origin to the influence of Mughlai cuisine. Some Indian kebabs have very specific geographic attributions, such as Kakori kebab, which is made of finely ground, soft mince and attributed to the city of Kakori in Uttar Pradesh, where legend has it that it was first prepared for old and toothless pilgrims.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan kebabs trace back their origin during the time of the Mughals Mughlai cuisine, and their influence on the cuisine of modern-day Pakistan. There are all sorts of kebab varieties such as seekh, chapli, shammi and other forms of roasted and grilled meats. As Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim country, pork is not used. Instead meats like beef, chicken, lamb, fish and sometimes buff are used in the making of kebabs.

===Southeast Asia===
&quot;Satay&quot; is a kebab of seasoned, skewered, and grilled meat, served with a sauce. It is a dish of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.

Satay may consist of diced or sliced chicken, goat, lamb, mutton, beef, pork, fish, other meats, or tofu. Traditionally skewers from the midrib of the coconut palm frond are used, although bamboo skewers are often used instead. It is grilled or barbecued over a wood or charcoal fire with spicy seasonings. It may be served with various sauces, though most often a combination of soy and peanut sauce. Hence, peanut sauce is often called satay sauce.

Satay was developed by Javanese street vendors as a unique adaptation of Indian kebab. The introduction of satay, and other now-iconic dishes such as &quot;tongseng&quot; and &quot;gulai kambing&quot; based on meats such as goat and lamb, coincided with an influx of Indian and Arab traders and immigrants starting in the 18th century. It is available almost anywhere in Indonesia, where it has become a national dish. In Sri Lanka, it has become a staple of the local diet as a result of the influences from the local Malay community.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
====South Africa====
&quot;Sosatie&quot; (plural &quot;sosaties&quot;) is a traditional South African dish of meat (usually lamb or mutton) cooked on skewers. The term derives from &quot;sate&quot; (&quot;skewered meat&quot;) and &quot;saus&quot; (spicy sauce). It is of Cape Malay origin. Sosatie recipes vary, but commonly the ingredients can include cubes of lamb, beef, chicken, dried apricots, red onions and mixed peppers.

====West Africa====
&quot;Suya&quot; is a spicy kebab which is a popular food item in West Africa that originated in Nigeria. It is traditionally prepared by the Hausa people of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, Ghana and some parts of Sudan (where it is called &quot;agashe&quot;).

&quot;Kyinkyinga&quot; is common and popular in West Africa. It is a Ghanaian dish, very similar to or synonymous with the Hausa &quot;suya&quot; kebab, also known as &quot;sooya, tsinga, chichinga, tsire agashi, chachanga&quot; or &quot;tankora&quot;.

==Other variants==

===Ćevapi===

&quot;Ćevapi&quot; () or &quot;ćevapčići&quot; (formal diminutive, , ), which comes from the word &quot;kebab&quot;, is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of skinless sausage, found traditionally in the countries of southeastern Europe (the Balkans). They are considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and are also common in Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Slovenia, as well as in North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania. Ćevapi has its origins in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Ottoman period, and represents a regional speciality similar to the kofte kebab. A dish with similar origins is in Romania called mititei.

===Pinchitos===

&quot;Pinchitos&quot; or &quot;Pinchos Morunos&quot; is a Moorish-derived kebab dish in Spanish cuisine. The name &quot;pinchitos&quot; is used in the southern Spanish autonomous communities of Andalusia and Extremadura. They consist of small cubes of meat threaded onto a skewer () which are traditionally cooked over charcoal braziers. Similar dishes in North Africa or other Muslim majority countries tend to be lamb-based, but pork and chicken are the most popular meats for the dish in Spain. Pinchitos are also extremely popular in Venezuela, due to the heavy influence Spain had in Venezuelan cuisine during many years.

===Shashlik===

&quot;Shashlik&quot; is similar to, or sometimes a synonym for, shish kebab. It is popular in many countries, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe, the Caucasus, and the Baltics. In non-Muslim-majority countries, shashlik and equivalent dishes like Romanian &quot;frigărui&quot; may sometimes be prepared with pork.

==Kebab in Western culture==

Kebab cuisine has spread around the world together with Muslim influence. Although non-Muslim Westerners may be increasingly familiar with some of the many other international kebab dishes, only two have become an established and widely popular part of the culture in many Western countries. In English, the word &quot;kebab&quot; commonly refers to &quot;shish kebab&quot; and, outside of North America, to &quot;döner kebab&quot; or related fast-food dishes. These dishes are also served in many other countries, where they may have different names.

Kebabs have also met opposition: in Italy, several cities banned kebab shops in order to preserve Italian culinary culture. Many protested against these bans as &quot;racist&quot;.

===Shish kebab===

In English, &quot;kebab&quot;, or in North America also &quot;kabob&quot;, often occurring as &quot;shish kebab&quot;, is now a culinary term for small pieces of meat cooked on a skewer. The word &quot;kebab&quot;, most likely derived from Persian, has been used with various spellings in this sense since at least the 17th century, while the Oxford English Dictionary records the earliest known publication of the term &quot;shish kebab&quot;, derived from , in 1914.

There are two etymologies suggested for Shish Kabob in the Persian dictionary of Dehkhoda: Shish being the Persian word &quot;Shish&quot; for the number 6, which refers to the original six pieces of meat of a standard Kabob skewer, or &quot;Shish&quot; being driven from Late Middle Persian &quot;Sich&quot; meaning a skewer. The word &quot;Kabob&quot; is most probably driven from the Arhameic word kbābā (to roast).
In many English-speaking countries, it refers to the now well-known dish prepared with marinated meat or seafood together with vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers threaded onto the skewer, also sometimes known as &quot;shashlik&quot;. This preparation is different from the typical Turkish shish kebab style, where vegetables are usually cooked on a separate skewer. Shish kebabs are customarily prepared in homes and restaurants, and are usually cooked on a grill or barbecue, or roasted in an oven.

The word &quot;kebab&quot; may also be used as a general term in English to describe any similar-looking skewered food, such as brochette, satay, souvlaki, yakitori, or numerous small chunks of any type of food served on a stick. This is different from its use in the West Asia, where &quot;shish&quot; (Persian/Mazandarani: شیش, ) is the word for skewer, while &quot;kebab&quot; comes from the word for grilling.

===Doner kebab===
English speakers from countries outside North America may also use the word &quot;kebab&quot; generally to mean the popular fast food version of the Turkish döner kebab, or the related shawarma or gyros, and the sandwiches made with them, available from kebab shops as take-away meals. This usage may be found in some non-English parts of Europe as well. In North America, the Greek variant gyros is most widely known.

The döner kebab originated in 19th century Turkey, but it became widely popular in the West only in the latter half of the 20th century. Many layers of meat are stacked onto a large vertical rotating spit; the outer surface is gradually cooked and sliced off, and typically served either mixed or topped with vegetables and sauces in a sandwich made with pita or other flatbreads. Certain regional variants also include cheeses. Sandwiches served in the same manner, but with other meats or cheese, may also sometimes be called a &quot;kebab&quot;. It is available in most parts of Europe, and many other countries, though sometimes with different names or serving styles. In Germany, the highly popular sandwich, introduced by Turkish immigrants, is called a &quot;Döner&quot;, though Arab shops there serve &quot;shawarma&quot;.

<text>Pankow () is the second largest area of Berlin by population (424,000 in 2023). In Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform, it was merged with the former boroughs of Prenzlauer Berg and Weißensee; the resulting borough retained the name Pankow. Pankow was sometimes claimed by the Western Allies (United States, United Kingdom, and France) to be the capital of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), while the German Democratic Republic itself considered East Berlin to be its capital.

==Overview==
The borough, named after the Panke river, covers the northeast of the city region, including the inner city locality of Prenzlauer Berg. It borders Mitte and Reinickendorf in the west, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg in the south, and Lichtenberg in the east. Pankow is Berlin&#x27;s largest borough by population and the second largest by area (after Treptow-Köpenick).

Between 1945 and 1960, Schönhausen Palace and the nearby Majakowskiring street in the Niederschönhausen locality of Pankow was the home to many members of the East German government. Western writers therefore often referred to &quot;Pankow&quot; as a metonym for the East German regime—as reflected by Udo Lindenberg&#x27;s song &quot;Sonderzug nach Pankow&quot;. The fact that &quot;-ow&quot; is rare as an ending for place names in West Germany and – especially in the wrong but common pronunciation /&#x27;pankof/ – sounds Slavic or more specifically &quot;Russian&quot; to German ears may have played a role in this use as it carried a connotation of the East German government being a foreign, more specifically Russian/Soviet, puppet regime — a claim right leaning newspapers and politicians often made much more openly than through this mere insinuation and connotation.

The Rykestrasse Synagogue, Germany&#x27;s largest synagogue, is located in the Prenzlauer Berg locality. The Weißensee Cemetery is one of the largest Jewish cemeteries in Europe. In northern Prenzlauer Berg, the &quot;Wohnstadt&quot; (&quot;residential town&quot;) &quot;Carl Legien&quot; is part of the Berlin Modernist Housing Estates UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Weißer See is the borough&#x27;s largest natural body of water.

==Subdivision==

The Pankow borough consists of 13 localities:

* Prenzlauer Berg
* Weissensee
* Blankenburg
* Heinersdorf
* Karow
* Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow
* Pankow
* Blankenfelde
* Buch
* Französisch Buchholz
* Niederschönhausen
* Rosenthal
* Wilhelmsruh

==Politics==
===District council===
The governing body of Pankow is the district council (&quot;Bezirksverordnetenversammlung&quot;). It has responsibility for passing laws and electing the city government, including the mayor. The most recent district council election was held on 26 September 2021, and the results were as follows:

<text>Charlottenburg () is a locality of Berlin within the borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. Established as a town in 1705 and named after Sophia Charlotte of Hanover, Queen consort of Prussia, it is best known for Charlottenburg Palace, the largest surviving royal palace in Berlin, and the adjacent museums.

Charlottenburg was an independent city to the west of Berlin until 1920 when it was incorporated into &quot;Groß-Berlin&quot; (Greater Berlin) and transformed into a borough. In the course of Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform it was merged with the former borough of Wilmersdorf becoming a part of a new borough called Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. Later, in 2004, the new borough&#x27;s districts were rearranged, dividing the former borough of Charlottenburg into the localities of Charlottenburg proper, Westend and Charlottenburg-Nord.

==Geography==

Charlottenburg is located in Berlin&#x27;s inner city, west of the Großer Tiergarten park. Its historic core, the former village green of Alt Lietzow, is situated on the southern shore of the Spree River running through the Berlin glacial valley. The Straße des 17. Juni road, former Charlottenburger Chaussee, which runs eastwards from Charlottenburg Gate through the Tiergarten park to Brandenburg Gate, connects Charlottenburg with the historic centre of Berlin-Mitte.

In the north and west, the Berlin Ringbahn and the Bundesautobahn 100 (&quot;Stadtring&quot;) mark the border with the Charlottenburg-Nord and Westend suburbs. Adjacent in the south is the territory of Wilmersdorf. Charlottenburg also borders on the district of Halensee in the southwest, as well as on Moabit, Hansaviertel and Tiergarten (all part of the Mitte borough) in the east and on Schöneberg in the southeast.

==History==
Archaeological findings in the area date back to the Neolithic era. Within the Margraviate of Brandenburg, on the land occupied by present-day Charlottenburg, there were three settlements in the late Middle Ages: the farmsteads Lietzow (pronounced leat-tsow) south of the Spree and Casow (pr. caasow) beyond the river, as well as a further settlement called Glienicke (pr. gleanicke). Although these names are of Slavic origin, the settlements are likely to have had a mixed Slavic and German population.

Lietzow (also called &quot;Lietze&quot;, &quot;Lutze&quot;, &quot;Lutzen&quot;, &quot;Lütze&quot;, &quot;Lützow&quot;, &quot;Lusze&quot; and &quot;Lucene&quot;) was first documented in 1239, when the Ascanian margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg founded the Benedictine &quot;Sankt Marien&quot; nunnery in nearby Spandau. The nuns were enfeoffed with the &quot;Lucene&quot; and &quot;Casow&quot; estates; while the Lietzow farmstead probably was expanded to a village by 1315, Casow was already mentioned as abandoned in the 1375 doomsday book of Emperor Charles IV. From old field names, it is believed that a third medieval settlement on Charlottenburg territory, &quot;Glienicke&quot;, arose in the area of the present day streets Kantstraße, Fasanenstraße, Kurfürstendamm and Uhlandstraße at the former &quot;Gliniker Lake&quot;.

Unlike Casow and Glienicke, the Lietzow area has been populated continuously and its development is well documented. In the course of the Protestant Reformation, Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg confiscated the monastic estates in 1542 and finally had the nunnery dissolved in 1558. For more than four hundred years, members of the Berendt family were mayors and thus had to pay lower taxes. A village church was first documented in 1541. Ecclesiastically, Lietzow came under the Wilmersdorf parish, the priests reached it from there by the so-called &quot;Priesterweg&quot; (priest&#x27;s way), on the line of the streets now called Leibnizstraße, Konstanzer Straße and Brandenburgische Straße.

===Charlottenburg Palace===
In 1695, Sophia Charlotte of Hanover received Lietzow from her husband, Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg, in exchange for her estates in Caputh and Langerwisch near Potsdam. Frederick had a summer residence built there for Sophie Charlotte by the architect Johann Arnold Nering between 1695 and 1699. After he had crowned himself Frederick I, King in Prussia, the &quot;Lützenburg&quot; castle was extended into a stately building with a cour d&#x27;honneur. The Swedish master builder Johann Friedrich Eosander supervised this work. Sophie Charlotte died in February 1705; shortly afterwards the settlement facing the palace was called &quot;Charlottenburg&quot; - the palace itself became &quot;Schloss Charlottenburg&quot; - and chartered as a town on 5 April 1705. The king served as the town&#x27;s mayor until the historic village of Lietzow was incorporated into Charlottenburg in 1720.

Frederick&#x27;s successor as king, Frederick William I of Prussia, rarely stayed at the palace, which depressed the small town of Charlottenburg. Frederick William even tried to revoke the town&#x27;s privileges. With the coronation of his successor Frederick II in 1740 the town&#x27;s significance increased, as regular celebrations again took place at the palace. Between 1740 and 1747 Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff built the eastern New Wing as Frederick&#x27;s residence. Later, Frederick II preferred the palace of Sanssouci, which he had partly designed himself.

When Frederick II died in 1786, his nephew Frederick William II succeeded him, and Charlottenburg became the favourite royal residence, and remained so for his son and successor Frederick William III (reigned 1797–1840). After the defeat of the Prussian army at Jena in 1806, the French occupied Berlin. Napoleon took over the palace, while his troops made a camp nearby. Charlottenburg became part of the new Prussian Province of Brandenburg in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars.

===Recreational and residential area===

In the late 18th century, Charlottenburg&#x27;s development did not depend only on the crown. The town became a recreational area for the expanding city of Berlin. Its first true inn opened in the 1770s, in the street then called &quot;Berliner Straße&quot; (now &quot;Otto-Suhr-Allee&quot;), and many other inns and beer gardens were to follow, popular for weekend parties especially. Berliners seeking leisure and entertainment came by boat, by carriage and later by horse-drawn trams, above all to a large amusement park at the shore of the Spree river called &quot;Flora&quot;, that went into bankruptcy in 1904.

From the 1860s on the wealthy Bourgeoisie of Berlin discovered Charlottenburg as a residential area, among the first were Gerson von Bleichröder and Ernst Werner von Siemens, who had a villa built in the &quot;Berliner Straße&quot; in 1862. At the same time industrial companies like Siemens &amp; Halske and Schering erected large factories in the north-east, at the border with the Moabit district of Berlin. In 1877 Charlottenburg received town privileges and until World War I saw an enormous increase of population with 100,000 inhabitants as of 1893 and a population of 306,000 in 1920, being the second largest city within the Province of Brandenburg, after Berlin. In the course of industrialization in the 19th century, much of Charlottenburg was incorporated in a network of streets laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring.

The development was accompanied by an urban planning of broad streets and sidewalks, parks and spacious residential buildings, especially around the southern Kurfürstendamm area, which enabled large parts of Charlottenburg to preserve their affluent residential character. &quot;The richest town of Prussia&quot; established a Technische Hochschule, the &quot;Königlich Technische Hochschule zu Berlin&quot; in 1879 (which later became the Technische Universität Berlin), followed by the &quot;Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt&quot; and the College of the Fine Arts. A new town hall with an tall spire was erected on the occasion of its 200-year jubilee in 1905 and an opera house opened in 1912. The history of Charlottenburg as a municipality in its own right ended with the Greater Berlin Act of 1 October 1920, when the town became a part of Berlin. The Province of Brandenburg was administered in Charlottenburg from 1918 until the province&#x27;s dissolution in 1946 after World War II.

Talaat Pasha, the former Ottoman Empire Minister of the Interior, one of the Three Pashas, and architect of the Armenian genocide, was assassinated by Soghomon Tehlirian in Charlottenburg on 15 March 1921.

===Borough of Berlin===
In the 1920s the area around the Kurfürstendamm evolved into the &quot;New West&quot; of Berlin, a development that had already started around 1900 with the opening of the Theater des Westens, the &quot;Café des Westens&quot; and the Kaufhaus des Westens, followed by several theatres, cinemas, bars and restaurants, which made Charlottenburg the Berlin centre of leisure and nightlife. Artists like
Alfred Döblin, Otto Dix, Gottfried Benn, Else Lasker-Schüler, Bertolt Brecht, Max Liebermann, Stefan Zweig and Friedrich Hollaender socialized in the legendary Romanisches Café at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. However the days of the Golden Twenties came to an end with the rise of the Nazi Party. In World War II the area around the Breitscheidplatz was heavily damaged by air raids and the Battle of Berlin.

After 1945 the city was partitioned by the allies and Charlottenburg became part of the British sector during the Cold War. The Kurfürstendamm area quickly regained its importance, as it became the commercial centre of West-Berlin. It was therefore the site of protests and major demonstrations of the late 1960s German student movement, that culminated on 2 June 1967, when student Benno Ohnesorg was shot by a police officer during a demonstration against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi at the Deutsche Oper.

Before the reunification of Berlin, Charlottenburg was the centre of West Berlin, with many high market bars and restaurants. After 1990 German reunification Charlottenburg struggled with the rise of the Mitte borough as Berlin&#x27;s historic centre. The City West is still the main shopping area, offering several major hotels, theatres, bars and restaurants.

The area around Charlottenburg&#x27;s Kantstrasse is Berlin&#x27;s Chinatown in the West, with a high concentration of Asian shops, gastronomy and inhabitants. It is commonly dubbed &quot;Kantonstrasse&quot;, in reference to the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.

<text>Steglitz-Zehlendorf () is the sixth borough of Berlin, formed in Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform by merging the former boroughs of Steglitz and Zehlendorf.

Home to the Free University of Berlin, the Berlin Botanical Garden, and a variety of museums and art collections, Steglitz-Zehlendorf is an important hub for research, science and culture in Berlin. It is known to be the wealthiest borough of Berlin, having the city&#x27;s highest median household income.

== History ==
The first mention of a present-day locality in the district by name was Lankwitz (Lancewitz) in 1239. It is assumed that Slavic and German settlements were established at the Schlachtensee and Krumme Lanke lakes after 1200 at the latest. The first documented mention of Zehlendorf (then Cedelendorp) dates back to 1242. Here the Lehnin Abbey bought the settlement and kept it until 1542. Frederick the Great donated a church to the village in 1768 during a stopover on the journey from the Berlin Palace to the Sanssouci Palace. The settlement was located halfway between the two places, which gave the village an economic boost through its function as a relay station. Steglitz also originated in the first half of the 13th century as a Linear settlement. At the end of this century the wooden church was replaced with the village church Steglitz. It stood until the 19th century, when it was replaced by Matthew&#x27;s Church.

Today&#x27;s double district is still characterized by connecting infrastructure between Berlin and Potsdam. For example, the first section of the Reichsstraße 1 was routed through Steglitz and Zehlendorf (paved in 1792). In 1838, the Stammbahn was opened parallel to this. This development of the suburbs led to a strong growth of the settlements. Steglitz became the largest rural municipality in Prussia around 1900 with 80,000 inhabitants. The former districts of Steglitz and Zehlendorf were formed in 1920 during the formation of Greater Berlin from previously independent rural communities and estate districts of the Teltow district. The entire area of the present district belonged to the American Sector of Berlin after the Second World War from 1945 to 1990, together with the districts of Tempelhof, Schöneberg, Neukölln and Kreuzberg. In 2001, the two formerly independent districts were merged to form the district of Steglitz-Zehlendorf as part of Berlin&#x27;s administrative reform. In December 2020, the new Locality Schlachtensee was founded on the initiative of local residents.

==Demographics==
As of 2021, Steglitz-Zehlendorf had a population of roughly 306 000, making it the fifth most populous out of Berlin&#x27;s twelve boroughs. The median age was 46,5, the highest of all Berlin boroughs. 28,8% of Steglitz-Zehlendorf residents had a migration background, lying under the Berlin average of 36%.

Steglitz-Zehlendorf has the highest number of Abitur (secondary education degree) graduates in Berlin. The borough also has the highest median household income and the lowest unemployment rate in Berlin. With 15% of Steglitz-Zehlendorf households making more than 200% of the German national median income, it is the wealthiest Berlin borough.

==Subdivision==

Since December 2020, the Steglitz-Zehlendorf borough consists of eight localities:

<doc id="390626" wikidata="Q77408" url="?curid=390626" title="Alfons Rebane">
<text>Alfons Vilhelm Robert Rebane (24 June 1908 – 8 March 1976) was an Estonian military commander. He was the most highly decorated Estonian military officer during World War II, serving in various Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS units of Nazi Germany.

After World War II Rebane joined the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) where he played a key role in assisting the armed resistance to Soviet rule in Estonia and other Baltic countries. He led the Estonian portion of MI6&#x27;s Operation Jungle well into the 1950s.

In 1961, Rebane retired from the British intelligence services and moved to Germany, where he stayed until his death in Augsburg in 1976. The 1999 reburial of Rebane in Estonia with state honors triggered a number of controversies.

== Early life ==
Rebane was born in Valga in southern Estonia, then part of the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire. In 1920 Rebane, son of a railway official, attended the Russian secondary school in Narva. From 1926 to 1929 he attended Tartu University and graduated from the Estonian Military Academy with first class honours. He served as an infantry officer on the armoured train &quot;Captain Irv&quot; of the 1st Armored Train Regiment as a second lieutenant in 1929. Married in 1931 to Agnia Soomets, they had one daughter Tiiu who died soon afterwards. On Estonian Independence Day on 24 February 1933, Rebane was promoted to first lieutenant. From 1935 to 1939 he served as junior instructor in the Defence League Viljandi County Territorial Regiment, between 1939 and 1940 in the Lääne County Territorial Regiment. From January to June 1940 Rebane was the Commandant of Lihula.

== World War II ==

Rebane served as an officer in the Estonian Army until Soviet troops occupied the country in 1940. The Soviets disbanded and absorbed most of the Estonian Armed Forces and arrested and executed the entire Estonian high command. Many junior officers, such as Rebane, were dismissed due to their lack of &quot;political reliability&quot; and were liable to be deported. For a while, Rebane worked in construction, then fled into the forests when the Soviets began mass deportations in 1941. He established and led a group of Forest Brothers in Virumaa (Northern Estonia) in May 1941.

After Germany had taken control of Estonia, Rebane joined the German Wehrmacht where he served in its combat formations in Northwestern Russia, subsequently becoming the captain of the 184th Security Battalion, which was later renamed to the Estonian 658th Eastern Battalion. In February 1944 Rebane&#x27;s unit was transferred to the Narva Front and attached to the Wehrmacht&#x27;s 26th Army Corps on 2 March. On 27 April 1944, the unit was released from the Wehrmacht. Rebane, after initially refusing, was forced to join the newly formed 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) of the Waffen-SS, eventually becoming colonel of the 47th Waffen-Grenadier Regiment. The Estonian division played a significant role in the Battle of Narva and the Battle of Emajõgi, holding back the Soviet re-occupation of Estonia until the Soviet Tallinn Offensive, September 1944 while suffering heavy casualties. Rebane&#x27;s unit was then evacuated to Germany for refitting and saw more action on the Eastern Front in the spring of 1945. Rebane had a reputation for tactical skill. With most of the Estonian forces captured by the Soviet Army in Czechoslovakia, Rebane managed to reach the British Occupation Zone with a number of his men at the end of the war. Soldiers who fought in units under his command were colloquially referred to as &quot;fox cubs&quot; (&quot;Rebane&quot; translates to &quot;fox&quot; in Estonian).

== Decorations ==
According to Carlos Jurado, an expert on non-German units, and Nigel Thomas: Rebane was &quot;the most decorated and probably the most talented and charismatic Baltic soldier during WWII&quot;. Rebane became one of the most decorated Estonians. During his days in the Estonian Army, he was awarded the Defence League White Cross 3rd Class and the Latvian Aizsargi Cross of Merit. In the German army he was awarded the Iron Cross first and second class, the War Merit Cross with swords second class, the Eastern Front Medal, the silver Infantry Assault Badge and the silver Ostvolk Medal for bravery. Rebane was also decorated with the silver Close Combat Clasp, awarded for hand-to-hand fighting by unsupported infantry for a total of 30 days. In February 1944 he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross and in April 1945 he was promoted to &quot;Waffen-Standartenführer&quot; and awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oakleaves for extreme bravery on the battlefield.

== Post war ==
In 1947 Rebane moved to England and joined the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) as the Estonian expert at the Intelligence School in London. There he played a key role in assisting the armed resistance to the Soviet rule in Estonia and other Baltic countries. He led the Estonian portion of MI6&#x27;s Operation Jungle well into the 1950s. In 1961, Rebane retired from the British intelligence services and moved to Germany, where he stayed until his death in Augsburg in 1976.

== Legacy ==
In 1977, and Beate Klarsfeld alleged Rebane was a war criminal. According to a 2005 report published by the Estonian State Commission on the Examination of the Policies of Repression, investigations conducted by the KGB after World War II found no documents confirming the accusation against Rebane and his &quot;army unit&quot;.

The return and reburial of Rebane&#x27;s ashes with military honours at a national cemetery in 1999 in Estonia sparked a controversy. The American Jewish Congress protested that the reburial served as an &quot;indication that fascist ideology is recognized in Estonia&quot;. A tombstone to Rebane, unofficially erected in 2004 but unveiled before Pärnumaa District Parliamentarian and former Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste, was protested by Russia&#x27;s Chief Rabbi, Berl Lazar and the Russian Jewish Congress.

The Estonian authorities assert that the Estonian Waffen-SS units engaged solely in combat operations at the front to defend Estonia&#x27;s independence and had nothing to do with punitive operations in the territories occupied by the Nazi Germany. According to the President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves &quot;We are witnesses to the information war against Estonia which already reminds of an ideological aggression&quot;. According to the editor of &quot;Virumaa Teataja&quot; newspaper Rein Sikk: &quot;Alfons Rebane was a good soldier according to our historians. He was never convicted of war crimes and [the allegations] are just a political game to try to show that Estonia has lots of fascists.&quot;

In June 2018, a plaque commemorating Rebane was unveiled on the wall of a private building in Mustla where he had lived. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested the unveiling.

<text>The Dunphy Show is an Irish chat show hosted by Eamon Dunphy that aired for one series on TV3 in 2003. The programme featured guest interviews, audience participation and live music from guest music groups. &quot;The Dunphy Show&quot; aired every Friday night in direct competition with &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ).

==History==

===Challenging &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;===
Since 1962, RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; had enjoyed total dominance of the Irish chat show market on a Saturday night and subsequently on Friday nights. In 2002, TV3 set about devising their own chat show which would go &quot;head-to-head&quot; and challenge RTÉ&#x27;s monopoly. By the start of 2003, planning was at an advanced stage after six months of preparatory work; however, little details were revealed about the precise nature of the show or who would host. Ironically, the team behind the programme included Cillian Fennell, an ex-RTÉ producer who had worked on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; during Gay Byrne&#x27;s final season.

In May 2003, TV3 announced that former soccer player and journalist Eamon Dunphy had signed a contract to present the new show. Following the announcement the media immediately declared a &quot;clash of the chat shows&quot; and a clash of personalities between Dunphy and Pat Kenny. In an interview with the &quot;RTÉ Guide&quot;, Kenny described broadcasting as a &quot;hobby for Dunphy&quot; and that &quot;if it goes pear-shaped for Eamon he&#x27;ll write another book about Gazza or something&quot;. Former chat show host Gay Byrne said that &quot;there wasn&#x27;t enough room for two talk shows&quot; and that TV3 would be &quot;scalded by the experience&quot;.

===Debut===
&quot;The Dunphy Show&quot; made its debut at 9:00 p.m. on 5 September 2003 for an initial run of thirty programmes. The opening set of guests included former footballer Páidí Ó Sé, author Candace Bushnell, journalist Robert Fisk, jockey Kieren Fallon and Huey Morgan from the Fun Loving Criminals, while the musical guests were Joe Dolan and his band, and singer-songwriter Paul Brady. The opening programme received relatively good reviews, with Shane Hegarty of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; stating that &quot;while there was little of the controversial Dunphy on show, there remained a real edge about the TV3 host. Ding, ding. End of round one. Kenny should be worried, Dunphy should be happy.&quot;

===Cancellation===
The first edition of &quot;The Dunphy Show&quot; attracted a total audience of 342,000. The first three shows attracted an average total audience of 260,000 compared to 615,000 for &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, however, the numbers tuning in for the third edition of Dunphy&#x27;s chat show fell to 157,000. In November it was announced that the show would be going off-air for a six-week break at Christmas due to commercial reasons and for contractual reasons with Dunphy. This was viewed in some media circles as an indication that the show was failing and it came in for some harsher criticism after a promising start. On 5 December 2003, exactly three months to the day since the show began, TV3 announced that it was cancelling &quot;The Dunphy Show&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;The Dunphy Show&quot; was broadcast from The Helix at Dublin City University (DCU) in front of an audience of 450, All bar one of the shows were broadcast live.

<doc id="390628" wikidata="Q800374" url="?curid=390628" title="Akihabara Station">
<text>is an interchange railway station in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. It is at the center of the Akihabara shopping district specializing in electronic goods.

==Lines==
Akihabara Station is served by the following lines.
JR East:
* Tōhoku Main Line
** Keihin-Tohoku Line
** Yamanote Line
* Sōbu Main Line
** Chūō-Sōbu Line

Tokyo Metro:

Metropolitan Intercity Railway Company:
*Tsukuba Express

The above-ground section of the station is cross-shaped, with the Chūō-Sōbu Line tracks running from east to west, and the Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku Line (and Tohoku Shinkansen and Ueno–Tokyo Line, which do not stop at Akihabara) from north to south.

==Station layout==
===JR East===
There are two island platforms serving four tracks for the Yamanote Line and the Keihin-Tohoku Line on the 2nd level, and two side platforms serving two tracks for the Sobu Line Local service on the 4th level.


Chest-high platform edge doors were installed on the Yamanote Line platforms in May 2015, to be brought into operation from 20 June 2015.
===Tokyo Metro===

There are two underground side platforms serving two tracks.


The song &quot;Koi Suru Fortune Cookie&quot; by AKB48 is to be used as the departure melody on the Hibiya Line platforms from spring 2016.

===Tsukuba Express===

There is an underground island platform serving two tracks.



==History==
Akihabara Station was opened in November 1890 as a freight terminal linked to Ueno Station via tracks following the course of the modern day Yamanote Line.

It was opened to passenger traffic in 1925 following the construction of the section of track linking Ueno with Shimbashi via Tokyo Station and the completion of the Yamanote Line. The upper level platforms were added in 1932 with the opening of an extension to the Sōbu Line from its old terminal at Ryōgoku to Ochanomizu, making Akihabara an important transfer station for passengers from the east of Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture.

The huge growth in commuter traffic following the Second World War caused considerable congestion and was only relieved with the construction of the Sōbu line tunnel linking Kinshichō with Tokyo, bypassing Akihabara.

The Hibiya Line subway station was opened on May 31, 1962, with the line&#x27;s extension from Naka-Okachimachi to Ningyōchō.

The station facilities of the Hibiya Line were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

On August 24, 2005, the underground terminus of the new Tsukuba Express Line opened at Akihabara. The entire station complex, including the JR station, was also refurbished and enlarged in preparation for the opening of the Tsukuba Express.

Station numbering was introduced in 2016 with Akihabara being assigned station numbers JY03 for the Yamanote line, JK28 for the Keihin-Tōhoku line, and JB19 for the Chūō-Sōbu line. At the same time, JR East assigned a three-letter code to their major interchange stations; Akihabara was assigned the three-letter code &quot;AKB&quot;.

&quot;TH Liner&quot; services on the Hibiya Line between and commenced on 6 June 2020.

==Passenger statistics==

In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 240,327 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the ninth-busiest station operated by JR East. Over the same fiscal year, the Tokyo Metro station was used by an average of 122,576 passengers daily (both exiting and entering passengers), making it the 23rd busiest Tokyo Metro station. The passenger figures for previous years are as shown below. Note that JR East figures are for boarding passengers only.

<text>Neukölln () is one of the twelve boroughs of Berlin, Germany. It is located south of Berlin&#x27;s centre and stretches southeastwards to the city boundary, encompassing the localities of Neukölln, Britz, Buckow, Rudow and Gropiusstadt.

Neukölln borough was part of the American sector during the Four-Power occupation of the city. It is characterised by having one of the highest percentages of immigrant residents in Berlin. An influx of students and artists since the mid-2000s has led to gentrification.

==History==

The Berlin district of Neukölln has a long and varied history that reflects the city&#x27;s changing political and cultural landscape.

Located in the south of the city, Neukölln was originally a small village on the outskirts of Berlin. Neukölln&#x27;s independence ended on 1 October 1920 when it was incorporated into Berlin. During the German revolution it was the centre of a soldier and worker&#x27;s council which controlled all local government departments, abolished the municipal authorities, took over the banks and declared housing to be communal property.

In September 1929, Goebbels led his men into Neukölln, a KPD stronghold, and the two warring parties exchanged pistol and revolver fire. During World War II, Neukölln was the location of a subcamp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp for Jewish and Romani women.

After World War II, Neukölln underwent significant transformation as a result of the city&#x27;s division by the Berlin Wall. The neighborhood was located in West Berlin and became a center of industry and commerce, with many factories and warehouses.
From 1966 to 1975 the Gropiusstadt was built, a &quot;Trabantenstadt&quot; or city-within-a-city housing estate, designed by architect Walter Gropius. In the 1980s and 1990s, Neukölln underwent a process of gentrification, with many artists, students, and young professionals moving into the area. In recent years, Neukölln has become known for its diverse and vibrant cultural scene, with a mix of traditional and alternative businesses and a thriving arts and music scene.

Today, Neukölln is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, with a diverse array of restaurants, cafes, and shops, as well as a number of cultural attractions and events. Despite its gentrification, Neukölln remains a working-class neighborhood with a diverse and multicultural population.

==Locality subdivisions==

Neukölln is subdivided into five localities:

==Public transport==


Neukölln is served by three operational sections of urban rail.

U-Bahn:

*U7: Rathaus Spandau ↔ Rudow (running northwest–southeast)
*U8: Wittenau ↔ Hermannstraße (running north–south)

Part of each of the following S-Bahn routes share an east–west-running section of Ringbahn track through Neukölln:

*S41/S42: Südkreuz → Gesundbrunnen → Südkreuz (clockwise ↔ anti clockwise circular)
*S45: Südkreuz ↔ Berlin Schönefeld Flughafen (only from Monday till Friday). An extension of the S45 is projected to run beyond the current terminus at Schönefeld Airport to the under construction Berlin Brandenburg Airport.
*S46: Westend ↔ Königs Wusterhausen
*S47: Spindlersfeld ↔ Hermannstraße

Among the numerous rail stations in Neukölln three act as interchanges:

* Hermannplatz - U7 / U8
* Hermannstraße - U8 / S-Bahn
* Berlin-Neukölln - U7 / S-bahn

==Demographics==
As of 2010, the borough had a population of 310,283, of whom 121,000 (38.9%) were of non-German ethnicity. The percentage is significantly higher in the locality of the same name, Neukölln. The borough is known for its large Turkish, Arab and Kurdish communities, which together make up roughly 18% of the borough&#x27;s population. Recently, there has been an influx of Romani people and Sub-Saharan Africans.

===Gentrification===
A trend is the rapid gentrification of certain neighbourhoods within the borough. There has been an influx of students, creatives and other young professionals of mostly Western origin avoiding higher rents which are charged in other parts of Berlin. This has caused a knock-on effect, with rents rising in some parts of Neukölln. Northern Neukölln, just to the south of the Kreuzberg area, has become informally referred to as &quot;Kreuzkölln&quot; as the area becomes increasingly fashionable.

==Politics==
===District council===
The governing body of Neukölln is the district council (&quot;Bezirksverordnetenversammlung&quot;). It has responsibility for passing laws and electing the city government, including the mayor. The most recent district council election was held on 26 September 2021, and the results were as follows:

It is situated in the northeast of Berlin. Marzahn-Hellersdorf borders to the Berlin boroughs of Lichtenberg in the west and Treptow-Köpenick in the south as well as to the Brandenburg municipalities of Ahrensfelde in the north and Hoppegarten and Neuenhagen in the east.

==Demographics==
As of 2010, the borough had a total population 248,264, of whom about 30,000 (12%) were of non-German origin. Therefore, it is considered to be the least ethnically diverse borough of Berlin with the highest percentage of (Ethnic) Germans. Although the immigrant minority is relatively small, the borough has a higher concentration of Russia-born, Kazakhstan-born (e.g. Volga Germans) and Vietnamese people as compared to other parts of the city. Recently, there has been a significant influx of people with Middle Eastern and Muslim backgrounds.

==Subdivision==

The borough consists of five former villages which all became part of Greater Berlin in 1920:
*Biesdorf
*Hellersdorf
*Kaulsdorf
*Mahlsdorf
*Marzahn

==History==
Each of the five districts the borough consists of originally came from one administrative district called &quot;Landkreis Niederbarnim&quot; and were incorporated into the city due to the establishment of Greater Berlin in 1920. Together with the two other boroughs Lichtenberg and Friedrichsfelde, they formed the borough Lichtenberg until 1979.
At the end of the 1970s especially the district Marzahn grew as a result of the building of the developing area Marzahn. Consequently, Marzahn was formed out of the five districts the borough consists of today in 1979.

As a result of the building of two more developing areas (Hellersdorf and Kaulsdorf) the number of inhabitants increased so that the borough Hellersdorf was founded out of the three districts Hellersdorf, Kaulsdorf and Mahlsdorf on 1 June 1986. 
The borough remained independent until 2001.

In view of whole Berlin, Marzahn-Hellersdorf shows the biggest changes concerning demography. In 1991 the average age of the two boroughs reached a number of 30,5 years which increased to 39,6 years due to the migration of the younger people.

==Politics==
===District council===
The governing body of Marzahn-Hellersdorf is the district council (&quot;Bezirksverordnetenversammlung&quot;). It has responsibility for passing laws and electing the city government, including the mayor. The most recent district council election was held on 26 September 2021, and the results were as follows:

<text>Adolf Reubke (December 6, 1805 – March 3, 1875) was a German organ builder.

Reubke was born in Halberstadt, the son of domain collector Georg Benjamin. His family moved to Hausneindorf in 1809, and Reubke began taking piano lessons. To pursue a professional career, he was sent to the Cathedral Gymnasium school, but left early after his father died. He later became an apprentice of a woodturner, but after some conflicts with his mentor, left the apprenticeship and continued woodturning at his family home.

Reubke&#x27;s interest in music remained, and he taught himself to build instruments, building his first organ in 1837. He eventually started an organ-building business based in Hausneindorf. From 1853 to 1858, the company built an organ with 53 voices for the Jakobikirche in Magdeburg, and from 1856 to 1861, it built the organ at Magdeburg Cathedral. In 1860, it built the organ for the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, the home of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.

Reubke married Elise Weiderhold, and the two had three sons: Friedrich Julius, born in 1834; Carl Ludwig Emil, born in 1836; and Otto, born in 1842. All three of his sons became musicians. In particular, Julius Reubke became a noted composer and pupil of Franz Liszt before his early death in 1858.

From 1860, Adolf ran his business, now called Reubke &amp; Sohn, with his son Emil. Emil continued to run the business after Adolf died, until his own death in 1884. Ernst Röver took over and, in turn, ran the business until his death.

Reubke died in 1875 in Hausneindorf.

<doc id="390633" wikidata="Q46976" url="?curid=390633" title="Chris Poland">
<text>Chris Poland (born December 1, 1957) is an American guitarist, best known as the former guitarist of the thrash metal band Megadeth. Since 2002, Poland has been the guitarist of the instrumental rock/jazz fusion bands OHM and OHMphrey, among others, and has appeared on several projects and albums from a variety of different genres.

==Biography==

===Welkin===
Poland joined Welkin as a replacement for their guitarist, Dick Maxfield. Other members of the band included drummer Mike Meany and bassist MoonMcGeach. He reunited with both of them at a &quot;clinic/performance&quot; in April 2010 at House of Guitars in Rochester, New York.

===The New Yorkers===
Poland would move to California and form the band The New Yorkers with Gar and Stu Samuelson, as well as Robbie Pagliari and other musicians.

===Megadeth (1984–1987)===
Poland joined Megadeth in 1984 after being introduced to Dave Mustaine and David Ellefson by Jay Jones, who was Megadeth&#x27;s manager at the time. Poland left the band abruptly, and was replaced by guitarist Mike Albert before Megadeth embarked on their first tour. Poland returned in October 1985 and then remained in the band until he and Samuelson were fired in 1987, due to alleged substance abuse, which had led Poland to sell off Mustaine and Ellefson&#x27;s guitar gear, along with his own. In response, Mustaine wrote the song &quot;Liar&quot; for their following album &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot;, which was partly meant as a callout to Poland.

Frontman Dave Mustaine retrospectively referred to Poland as &quot;an amazing guitar player—he can play circles around me&quot; in a Behind the Music episode that aired on VH1 in 2001.

===Circle Jerks===
Poland played bass with Circle Jerks briefly in 1989, replacing Zander Schloss.

===&quot;Rust in Peace&quot; demos===
In 1990, Mustaine asked Poland to record solos for demos that would become songs for &quot;Rust In Peace&quot;. Poland agreed to play the solos, but did not rejoin the band, at the urging of his manager, Janie Hoffman. He played on demos of almost all of the songs that would end up on the studio album. Ultimately, Megadeth recruited Marty Friedman to play the solos for the album. Poland&#x27;s solos can be heard on the 2004 remastered version of &quot;Rust In Peace&quot;.

===Final return to Megadeth and lawsuit===
He and Mustaine teamed up one final time in 2004 to record Megadeth&#x27;s comeback album, &quot;The System Has Failed&quot;, though Poland opted not to rejoin the band full-time.

In 2004, after the reissue and re-release of &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, a lawsuit was filed against Mustaine regarding the use of three &quot;Rust In Peace&quot; demos on the album&#x27;s reissue without Poland&#x27;s permission. Poland settled and &quot;ended a professional relationship with Mustaine and Megadeth&quot;. Poland explained the circumstances in a 2018 interview with the As The Story Grows podcast, realizing that he would not be paid for the demos that were included on the reissue.

===2000s===
In 2009, Poland formed OHMphrey, a side-project with Robby Pagliari of OHM, and Jake Cinninger, Kris Myers, and Joel Cummins of progressive rock band Umphrey&#x27;s McGee.

In 2019, Poland appeared on the track &quot;Hammer (Comes Down)&quot;, on Megadeth bassist David Ellefson&#x27;s solo release &quot;Sleeping Giants&quot;, with Mark Tremonti, Thom Hazaert, Dave McClain and Joey Radziwill of Sacred Reich, and Flotsam and Jetsam vocalist Eric AK. It was later announced Poland had signed to Ellefson&#x27;s revived Combat Records, who would release a 30th Anniversary Edition of his solo debut &quot;Return to Metalopolis&quot; in 2020. The expanded 2-CD/LP configuration, features a remastered version of the original LP, with four new tracks, and material from the independently released, out of print 2007 release &quot;Return to Metalopolis Live&quot;. It was later announced in 2020 that Poland would tour Australia and Japan, with Ellefson and Hazaert, supporting Ellefson&#x27;s eponymous solo band.

In January 2020, Poland was inducted into the Metal Hall of Fame, alongside Geoff Tate, Don Dokken, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Prong, Graham Bonnet, and more. Poland was inducted by Hazaert and former Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel who joined Poland for a performance of &quot;Peace Sells&quot;, with Butcher Babies bassist Ricky Bonazza, and Dead by Wednesday drummer Opus Lawrence and guitarist Dave Sharpe, who also tour with Ellefson and Hazaert in Ellefson&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Giants&quot; solo band. Poland also performed &quot;Paranoid&quot; at the induction, with Vai, Satriani, and Tate.

<doc id="390635" wikidata="Q800989" url="?curid=390635" title="Kanda Station (Tokyo)">
<text>is a railway station in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and Tokyo Metro operate individual portions of the station.

==Lines==
* JR East
** Keihin-Tōhoku Line
** Yamanote Line
** Chūō Line (Rapid)
* Tokyo Metro
** Tokyo Metro Ginza Line

==Station layout==
Kanda consists of two separate stations that form an interchange. The elevated station is operated by JR East and the underground station is operated by the Tokyo Metro. Although they are an interchange, passengers must pass through ticket barriers and pay separate fares to switch between services.

===JR East station===
The JR East station is the older of the two stations and opened in 1919. It is situated on an elevated viaduct and has three island platforms serving six tracks. The platforms are numbered sequentially from east to west starting with platform 1. Yamanote Line trains use the inner platforms 2 and 3, Keihin-Tōhoku Line trains use platforms 1 and 4, and Chūō Line trains use platforms 5 and 6 as they split off from the main line north of Kanda. There are an additional two tracks east of the station; these are used for Shinkansen trains running between Tokyo Station and .

There are two sets of entrances and exits (a total of four) that allow passengers to access the JR East station. The northern set, the north and east exits, offers a connection to the Ginza Line on the Tokyo Metro. The southern set, the south and west exits, has a View Plaza travel service centre. Both exits have rows of ticket machines, ticket gates, and a JR reservation office.




===Tokyo Metro===
The Tokyo Metro station is the newer of the two stations and opened in 1931 as part of an extension of first subway line in Asia, the Ginza Line. There is a simple island platform setup with two tracks. Platform 1 is for southbound trains to and whilst platform 2 is used for northbound trains to and .

Access to the station is provided by a total of six entrances and exits. Exits and 1 and 2 are used as the connection to the JR East station and are on Chūō-dōri (中央通り). Exits 3 and 4 are on the same street but in the centre of the station near Kanda-Kajichō. Exits 5 and 6 are at the northernmost part of the station.

The song &quot;Omatsuri Mambo&quot; (お祭りマンボ, &quot;Omatsuri Mambo&quot;) by Hibari Misora is used as the departure melody for the Ginza Line platforms in 2015.

==History==
The station first opened on March 1, 1919 when the Chūō Main Line was extended from Manseibashi Station, which existed between Kanda and , to Tokyo Station.

The tracks of Tōhoku Main Line, now used by trains on the Keihin-Tōhoku Line and the Yamanote Line, extended from Akihabara Station to Kanda and further to Tokyo on November 1, 1925. This extension completed the loop of the Yamanote Line.

The subway station opened on November 21, 1931. On this day, the subway closed the temporary terminal at Manseibashi Station and made Kanda Station the new terminus. The station became an intermediate station on April 29, 1932 when the line was extended to Mitsukoshimae Station.

The station facilities of the Ginza Line were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

The extension through Kanda Station of the Tōhoku Shinkansen from its previous terminus at to breached a pair of express tracks of the Tohoku Main Line through the station. These are being reinstated by the Tōhoku Jūkan Line project. The project was due to be completed in 2013 but was subsequently delayed until 2015 as a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

From March 14, 2015 onwards, Keihin-Tōhoku rapid services began serving the station.

Station numbering was introduced to the JR East platforms in 2016 with Kanda being assigned station numbers JC02 for the Chūō line rapid, JK27 for the Keihin–Tōhoku Line, and JY02 for the Yamanote line. At the same time, JR East assigned the station a three-letter code to its major transfer stations; Kanda was assigned the code &quot;KND&quot;.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 97,589 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the fortieth-busiest station operated by JR East. In fiscal 2013, the Tokyo Metro station was used by an average of 52,612 passengers per day (exiting and entering passengers), making it the seventieth-busiest station operated by Tokyo Metro. The average daily passenger figures for each operator in previous years are as shown below.

* Note that JR East figures are for boarding passengers only.

<text>Lichtenberg () is the eleventh borough of Berlin, Germany. In Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform it absorbed the former borough of Hohenschönhausen.

==Overview==
The district contains the Tierpark Berlin in Friedrichsfelde, the larger of Berlin&#x27;s two zoological gardens. During the period of Berlin&#x27;s partition between West and East, Lichtenberg was the location of the headquarters of the Stasi, the East German state security service. Prior to the establishment of the GDR it housed the main office of the Soviet Military Administration in Berlin, and before that it was an officers&#x27; mess of the Wehrmacht. The complex is now the location of the Stasi Museum. The Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial is on the site of the main remand prison of the Stasi. Additionally, Lichtenberg is the location of the German-Russian Museum, the historical venue of the unconditional surrender of the German armed forces (Wehrmacht) on 8 May 1945.

The population is ethnically diverse, and has a significant Vietnamese community.

==Subdivision==

Lichtenberg is divided into 10 localities:

==History==
The historic village of Lichtenberg together with neighbouring Friedrichsfelde, Karlshorst, Marzahn, Biesdorf, Hellersdorf, Kaulsdorf and Mahlsdorf was incorporated as the 17th borough of Berlin by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act.

In the 1970s, the East German government had large pre-fabricated high-rise housing estates (&quot;Plattenbau&quot;) built in the east of the Lichtenberg borough. This area was separated off and became the new borough of Marzahn, which included Biesdorf, Hellersdorf, Kaulsdorf and Mahlsdorf in 1979. In 1986, this district in turn was split into the two boroughs of Marzahn and Hellersdorf in 1986, and again merged as Marzahn-Hellersdorf by the 2001 administrative reform.

==Politics==
===District council===
The governing body of Lichtenberg is the district council (&quot;Bezirksverordnetenversammlung&quot;). It has responsibility for passing laws and electing the city government, including the mayor. The most recent district council election was held on 26 September 2021, and the results were as follows:
