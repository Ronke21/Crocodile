<text>Vasily Ilyich Safonov (; 27 February 1918), also known as Wassily Safonoff, was a Russian pianist, teacher, conductor and composer.

==Biography==
Vasily Safonov, or Safonoff as he was known in the West during his lifetime, was born at (also known as Itschory, Itsyursk, or Itsiursk), Russian Caucasus (now in Chechnya), son of the Cossack General Ilya Ivanovich Safonov.

Safonov was educated at the Imperial Alexandra Lyceum, Saint Petersburg, and at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory of Music from 1881 until 1885 under Louis Brassin. He graduated as Bachelor of Laws, and won the gold medal as a pianist of the Conservatory. He was also a pupil of Theodor Leschetizky and Nikolai Zaremba.

Safonov had several daughters. Anna Vasilyevna Timiryova (1893–1975) was a poet who spent much of her life in labor camps or in exile. Varvara Vasilievna Safonova (1895–1942), a painter, died during the siege of Leningrad. Yelena Vasilievna Safonova (1902–1980), studied painting, designed theatre costumes, and published children&#x27;s books. From 1932 to 1958 she lived in exile in the city of Kursk.

Safonov was never a particularly successful composer in his own right, but was a master music educator, becoming director of the Moscow Conservatory in 1889. He was the director of the National Conservatory of Music in New York.

He was the teacher of some of the best Russian pianists, notably Alexander Scriabin, Nikolai Medtner, Josef Lhévinne and Rosina Bessie (later Lhévinne). He also taught the noted teacher and theorist Madame Maria Levinskaya, and Marthe Servine, a French-American composer and pianist.

After retiring from teaching, Safonov became well known as a conductor. He was the conductor of the first Moscow performance of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Pathétique&quot; Symphony (No. 6), on 4/16 December 1893, seven weeks after its premiere under the composer&#x27;s baton and six weeks after his death.

He conducted nearly all the principal orchestras in Europe, including the philharmonic orchestras of Berlin, Vienna and Prague, the Lamoureux Orchestra of Paris, the London Symphony, the Orchestra dell&#x27;Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia and the New York Philharmonic Society.

Safonov is the first known modern conductor to have dispensed with the use of the baton, which came about when he forgot to take his baton to a rehearsal on a certain occasion; he chose to use his hands alone, and decided that from then on a baton was entirely unnecessary. Safonov died in Kislovodsk on 27 February 1918, aged 66.

<text>The vaquita ( ; Phocoena sinus) is a species of porpoise endemic to the northern end of the Gulf of California in Baja California, Mexico. Reaching a maximum body length of (females) or (males), it is the smallest of all living cetaceans. 

The species is currently on the brink of extinction, and is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List; the steep decline in abundance is primarily due to bycatch in gillnets from the illegal totoaba fishery.

== Taxonomy ==
The vaquita was defined as a species by two zoologists, Kenneth S. Norris and William N. McFarland, in 1958 after studying the morphology of skull specimens found on the beach. It was not until nearly thirty years later, in 1985, that fresh specimens allowed scientists to describe their external appearance fully.

The genus &quot;Phocoena&quot; comprises four species of porpoise, most of which inhabit coastal waters (the spectacled porpoise is more oceanic). The vaquita is most closely related to Burmeister&#x27;s porpoise (&quot;Phocoena spinipinnis&quot;) and less so to the spectacled porpoise (&quot;Phocoena dioptrica&quot;), two species limited to the Southern Hemisphere. Their ancestors are thought to have moved north across the equator more than 2.5 million years ago during a period of cooling in the Pleistocene. Genome sequencing from an individual captured in 2017 indicates that the ancestral vaquitas had already gone through a major population bottleneck in the past, which may explain why the few remaining individuals are still healthy despite the very low population size.

&quot;Vaquita&quot; is Spanish for &quot;little cow&quot;.

== Description ==

The smallest living species of cetacean, the vaquita can be easily distinguished from any other species in its range. It has a small body with an unusually tall triangular dorsal fin, a rounded head, and no distinguished beak. The coloration is mostly grey with a darker back and a white ventral field. Prominent black patches surround its lips and eyes. Sexual dimorphism is apparent in body size, with mature females being longer than males and having larger heads and wider flippers. Females reach a maximum size of about , while males reach about . Dorsal fin height is greater in males than in females. They are also known to weigh around to . This makes them one of the smallest species in the porpoise family.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Vaquita habitat is restricted to a small portion of the upper Gulf of California (also called the Sea of Cortez), making this the smallest range of any cetacean species. They live in shallow, turbid waters of less than depth.

== Diet ==
Vaquitas are generalists, foraging on a variety of demersal fish species, crustaceans, and squids, though benthic fish such as grunts and croakers make up most of the diet.

== Social behavior ==
Vaquitas are generally seen alone or in pairs, often with a calf, but have been observed in small groups of up to 10 individuals.

Little is known about the life history of this species. Life expectancy is estimated at about 20 years and age of sexual maturity is somewhere between 3 and 6 years of age. While an initial analysis of stranded vaquitas estimated a two-year calving interval, recent sightings data suggest that vaquitas can reproduce annually. It is thought that vaquitas have a polygynous mating system in which males compete for females. This competition is evidenced by the presence of sexual dimorphism (females are larger than males), small group sizes, and large testes (accounting for nearly 3% of body mass).
== Population status ==
Because the vaquita was only fully described in the late 1980s, historical abundance is unknown. Since 1983, all confirmed specimens, records, and sightings of &quot;P. sinus &quot;were evaluated. There were 45 records of &quot;P. sinus&quot; that were collected by skeletal remains, photographs, and sightings in 1983. The first comprehensive vaquita survey throughout their range took place in 1997 and estimated a population of 567 individuals. By 2007 abundance was estimated to have dropped to 150. Population abundance as of 2018 was estimated at less than 19 individuals. Given the continued rate of bycatch and low reproductive output from a small population, it is estimated that there are fewer than 10 vaquitas alive as of February 2022. In 2023, it is still estimated that there are as few as 10 in the wild. A 2024 survey observed a minimum of 6 to 8 individuals (with a maximum of 9 to 11), the lowest ever count, but this number may just be a result of the small survey area instead of an actual population decline, as vaquitas freely move in and out of the survey region.

== Reproduction ==
Vaquitas reach sexual maturity from three to six years old. Vaquitas have synchronous reproduction, suggesting that calving span is greater than a year. Their pregnancies last from 10 to 11 months, and vaquita calves are nursed by their mothers for 6–8 months until becoming independent. Vaquitas give birth about every other year to a single calf, usually between the months of February and April. Because of their low reproduction rates, long gestation periods and larger species size, vaquitas are considered a &quot;K&quot;-selected species. &quot;K&quot;-selected species are more vulnerable to extinction as they cannot repopulate at the rate of &quot;r&quot;-selected species. Vaquitas are on the brink of extinction because their numbers are few and they cannot replenish their population fast enough to exceed the number of vaquitas dying off.

== Threats ==
=== Fisheries bycatch ===

Anthropogenic effects of a rise in commercial fishing such as accidental bycatch, illegal fishing, and entanglement have been linked to the cause of their decline. Shrimp fishing and gillnets create entanglement issues for the vaquita. Aspects of illegal fishing include open access fisheries and absent fisheries management has correlated towards poaching of the main prey source of the vaquita.

The drastic decline in vaquita abundance is the result of fisheries bycatch in commercial and illegal gillnets, including fisheries targeting the now-vulnerable Totoaba, shrimp, and other available fish species. Despite government regulations, including a partial gillnet ban in 2015 and establishment of a permanent gillnet exclusion zone in 2017, illegal totoaba fishing remains prevalent in vaquita habitat, and as a result the population has continued to decline. Fewer than 19 vaquitas remained in the wild in 2018. Large-mesh gillnets used in illegal fishing for totoaba caused an increase in the rate of loss of vaquitas after 2011.

In 2021, the Mexican government eliminated a &quot;no tolerance&quot; zone in the Upper Gulf of California and opened it up to fishing.

In 2022 the navy began to place concrete blocks with rebar hooks into what is considered the primary area for vaquita, which was designated as a zero tolerance area (ZTA) for fishing in 2020. These are known to destroy gillnets (which can cost tens of thousands of dollars) in shallower waters. Their deployment had an immediate effect on the number of fishing boats in the area. Citing reports of echolocation outside of the ZTA, the navy expanded the area in which these blocks were placed starting in November 2023 with plans to continue placing new blocks until the end of June 2024. There are some concerns that the hooks will create ghost nets, and the navy and Sea Shepherd have removed nets trapped on hooks after being caught.

=== Other threats ===
Given their proximity to the coast, vaquitas are exposed to habitat alteration and pollution from runoff. Pesticides present in the water as a result of runoff from agriculture are a threat as they can be ingested by the vaquitas, causing harm and even death. Exposure to toxic compounds has also had a deleterious effect on vaquitas.
Bycatch, which is the incidental catch of non-target species in fishing gear, is not only the largest threat to the survival of the vaquita, but to all marine mammals around the world. A series of simulations in a 2022 study indicate that the species has a chance to survive and recover if all bycatch is halted, despite the presence of other threats.
However, the biggest threat still towards vaquita are fisheries. Northern fishing fleets have had an indirect positive impact mainly on marine mammals, because fishing on predators like sharks reduces its predatory negative impact on those groups. Although the predation of sharks towards vaquita do result in a decline in population and is seen as an alternate threat, northern fishing fleets also negatively impact this small marine mammal because the negative influence of incidental catch is greater than the positive influence of predation reduction by shark fisheries.

Populations that experience a sudden decline in numbers are often more vulnerable to other threats in the future due to a bottleneck of genetic diversity within the reduced population. The reduced gene pool lowers the rate of adaptation and increases the rate of inbreeding, potentially leading to inbreeding depression. This phenomenon is attributed to the anthropogenic Allee effect, specifically on the end where small population size leads to low species fitness because of a lack of genetic diversity and the potential for inbreeding. Because of their small population size, vaquitas are experiencing a negative Allee effect, attributing to even smaller population growth rates, driving them further into extinction. However, a 2022 study on the genetic diversity of the vaquita suggests that the marine mammal’s historically small population ensures it is unlikely to greatly suffer from inbreeding depression. 

Attempts to start a population in captivity have proved to be more threatening to the population than helpful. A November 2017 effort ended up traumatizing and killing one female vaquita, as well as invoking unnecessary stress onto a juvenile. Still, creating a captive population could be used as a last resort to save the species and to further educate on vaquitas.

== Conservation ==

=== Conservation status ===
The vaquita is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, which is only one level above being completely extinct in the wild. It is considered the most endangered marine mammal in the world. The vaquita has been listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 1996. The vaquita is at risk of extinction due to its small population size. It was approximated at one point that there were 150 individuals.

In 2019, the UNESCO World Heritage Site where the last vaquita are located was classified as a World Heritage Site in Danger. 

The vaquita is also protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Mexican Official Standard NOM-059 (Norma Oficial Mexicana), and Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

For a small population such as the vaquita to recover after a severe decline in population size is very difficult. This conservation status is strongly influenced in part of the species reproductive biology. The large amount of unknown surrounding the key reproductive parameters of the vaquita makes understanding its potential for recovery even harder.

=== Conservation efforts ===
The vaquita is found only in the upper Gulf of California, Mexico area. Anthropogenic effects of a rise in commercial fishing such as accidental by-catch, illegal fishing, and entanglement have been linked to the cause of their decline. Shrimp fishing and gillnets create entanglement issues for the vaquita. Aspects of illegal fishing include open access fisheries and absent fisheries management have correlated towards poaching of the main prey source of the vaquita. The swim bladders of the &quot;Totoaba macdonaldi&quot; are being sold on the black market by cartels for profit.

The Mexican government, international committees, scientists, and conservation groups have recommended and implemented plans to help reduce the rate of bycatch, enforce gillnet bans, and promote population recovery.

Protection efforts throughout Mexico have taken place in order to preserve the population. In 2017, the Government of Mexico established it as a felony to remove an endangered species. Alongside this, the Government of Mexico also made a public agreement to prohibit gillnet use. Efforts are proactive in incentive applications to fisheries in a system of trade-offs that benefit fishermen and the vaquita.

Mexico launched a program in 2008 called PACE-VAQUITA in an effort to enforce the gillnet ban in the Biosphere Reserve, allow fishermen to swap their gillnets for vaquita-safe fishing gear, and provide economic support to fishermen for surrendering fishing permits and pursuing alternative livelihoods. Despite the progress made with legal fishermen, hundreds of poachers continued to fish in the exclusion zone. Poaching continues as the swim bladders of totoaba can sell for anywhere from $20,000 to upwards of $80,000, and they are often referred to as the &quot;cocaine of the sea.&quot; A black market for totoaba swim bladders has developed fairly recently in China (including Hong Kong). In 2017, poachers received up to US$20,000 for a kilogram of totoaba swim bladders, with some making as much as $116,000 in one day.

The swim bladders of the &quot;Totoaba macdonaldi&quot; are being sold on the black market by cartel for profit. With continued illegal totoaba fishing, which is largely motivated by sales to the Chinese market where it is used in traditional medicine, and uncontrolled bycatch of vaquitas, the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA) recommended that some vaquitas be removed from the high-density fishing area and be relocated to protected sea pens. This effort, called VaquitaCPR, captured two vaquitas in 2017; one was later released and the other died shortly after capture after both suffered from shock.

Local and international conservation groups, including Museo de Ballena and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, are working with the Mexican Navy to detect fishing in the Refuge Area and remove illegal gillnets. In March 2020, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) announced a ban on imported Mexican shrimp and other seafood caught in vaquita habitat in the northern Gulf of California.

In response to the dire circumstances facing the vaquita as by-catch of the illegal totoaba trade, in 2017 Earth League International (ELI) commenced an investigation and intelligence gathering operation called Operation Fake Gold, during which the entire illicit totoaba maw (swim bladder) international supply chain, from Mexico to China, has been mapped and researched. Thanks to the confidential data that ELI shared with the Mexican authorities, in November 2020, a series of important arrests were made in Mexico.

To date, efforts have been unsuccessful in solving the complex socioeconomic and environmental issues that affect vaquita conservation and the greater Gulf of California ecosystem. Necessary action includes habitat protection, resource management, education, fisheries enforcement, alternative livelihoods for fishermen, and raising awareness of the vaquita and associated issues.

Jaramillo-Legorreta, et al. stated in 2007 that captive breeding programs were not a viable option for saving the species from extinction.

The Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) announced on February 27, 2021, that it may reduce the protected area for the vaquita in the Sea of Cortés as there are only ten of the porpoises left and it may never recuperate its historical range.

Beginning in July 2022, the Mexican government placed 193 concrete blocks in the Gulf of California no-tolerance zone, intended to allow the detection of nets by acoustic sonar and prevent further entrapment of vaquitas.

Creating protected areas is always an option for conservationists, but because the vaquita&#x27;s range is so small, there would be no use in trying to establish habitat corridors. One option for conservationists could be trying to create buffer zones near the coast in which pesticides harmful to vaquitas are restricted or even unavailable in order to enhance the protection value of the vaquita&#x27;s range.

In May 2023, a wildlife survey expedition discovered that the population had stabilized since it had last been recorded in 2021.

In October 2024, Colossal Biosciences announced their non-profit foundation dedicated to conservation of extant species, with one of their first projects being the vaquita. Colossal plans to biobank genetic material to revive the species if it were to become extinct, and to use acoustic sensors and drones to monitor vaquitas in collaboration with CONANP.

Roughly 80% of shrimp caught in the northern end of the Gulf of California, which has a high aquatic mammal bycatch rate, is consumed in the United States. As such, U.S. consumers of this shrimp are likely contributing to the vaquita extinction crisis. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which forbids foreign fishers from exporting seafood with high levels of marine mammal bycatch, may allow for better efforts to preserve endangered vaquitas.

In 2024, the Mexican government announced a new agreement with Sea Shepherd aimed at increasing protection for the species.

<text>Gruppo Bertone, commonly known as Bertone, was an Italian industrial design company which specialized in car styling, coachbuilding and manufacturing. It was also a car manufacturing company.

The company was based in Grugliasco, northern Italy. Gruppo Bertone was founded as Carrozzeria Bertone in 1912 by Giovanni Bertone. Designer Nuccio Bertone took charge of the company after World War II and the company was divided into two units: &quot;Carrozzeria&quot; for manufacturing and &quot;Stile Bertone&quot; for styling. Until its bankruptcy in 2014, the company was headed by the widow of Nuccio Bertone, Lilli Bertone. At the time of bankruptcy, it had around 100 direct employees. In 2014, most employees lost their jobs and were not absorbed by following acquisitions. Cars from the company museum went to other museums, like Automotoclub Storico Italiano and Volandia.

After its bankruptcy, the Bertone name was acquired by an architect and retained by some of its former employees, who continued as a Milan-based small external design office, Bertone Design, more focused on industrial design and architecture. Bertone Design was sold to the group AKKA Technologies in the second quarter of 2016, which already had automotive design activities through Mercedes-Benz Technologies. The AKKA Technologies group subsequently sold the Bertone brand in 2020 to Mauro and Jean-Franck Ricci, the new owners. In 2022, Mauro and Jean-Franck Ricci revived the Bertone brand. The first in a series of limited edition vehicles, the GB110, was presented in December 2022, then unveiled in June 2024.

==History==

=== Early years ===
Giovanni Bertone started a carriage manufacturing business in Turin, Italy, at the age of 28. Along with three workers, he built horse-drawn vehicles. In 1914, Bertone&#x27;s second son, Giuseppe, nicknamed &quot;Nuccio&quot;, was born. The outbreak of the First World War forced Giovanni Bertone to close his company. In 1920, a new plant was opened near the Monginevro 119 in Turin. Twenty people were on the payroll. One year later, a contract on a torpedo-styled body based on the SPA 23S chassis was signed by the company. Then, the FIAT &quot;501 Sport Siluro Corsa&quot; was designed.

During the 1920s, Giovanni Bertone began doing bodywork on the Fast, Chiribiri, Aurea, SCAT, and Diatto chassis. Vincenzo Lancia nicknamed him &quot;Bertunot&quot;; he commissioned Bertone to create cars for the &quot;limited series&quot;. Giovanni Bertone produced torpedo and saloon bodies for FIAT and Lancia and for Itala, Diatto, and SPA. Alongside sports models like the 1928 Ansaldo 6BS, Giovanni Bertone also designed cars like the Fiat 505 limousine and the Itala 51S, both in 1924. He later designed the Lancia Lambda VIII Series in 1928. In 1932, Giovanni designed the Lancia Artena, which was produced until 1936. In 1933, Nuccio Bertone officially began working in his father&#x27;s company. The company moved to Corso Peschiera 225. Gruppo Bertone now had fifty members of staff. In 1934, Bertone created the Fiat 527S Ardita 2500.

With the outbreak of the Second World War, Bertone reacted to the crisis by turning to manufacturing military vehicles. The company created vehicles such as the Bertone ambulance on a Lancia Artena base. The chassis Fiat 2800 cabriolet was manufactured; it was built on commission for race driver and motoring journalist Giovanni Lurani Cernuschi. Nuccio Bertone also created cars like the Lancia Aprilia Cabriolet, the Fiat 1100 Stanguellini racing car, and the Berlinetta Aerodinamica Tecnica (BAT) concept cars.

In 1956, they produced the Abarth 750 Record; it was built on a Fiat 600 chassis and tested on the high-speed track at Monza. Abarth 750 Record sets ten world records, including doing at an average of 156.36 km/h and covering 10,125.26 km in 72 hours. In 1957, the company expanded to start the production of the NSU Sport Prinz. Construction work began in Grugliasco for a new plant that became operative in 1959 with a workforce of 550. At the end of the 1950s, Bertone created the Giulietta Sprint Speciale, the Aston Martin DB2/4, and the Maserati 3500 GT.

=== 1960s – 1990s ===
Giorgetto Giugiaro came up with five variations of five GT models: the Alfa Romeo 2600 Sprint, in coupé and cabriolet versions; two Ferrari 250 GTs, one named &#x27;Wax&#x27; after the commissioning client; and the others for his personal use, the Aston Martin DB4 GT &#x27;Jet&#x27; and the Maserati 5000 GT. At the same time, two new industrial partnerships were worked on with the Simca 1000 Coupé and the BMW 3200 CS limited series. The ASA 1000 GT, better known as the &quot;Ferrarina&quot;, or &quot;little Ferrari&quot; (as the project originated with Enzo Ferrari), was a commercial failure upon its release. The Iso Rivolta GT 300, the Iso Rivolta GT 340, and the Iso Grifo were also created in the 1960s. Giorgetto Giugiaro designed a prototype cabriolet of the latter and a racing version known as the A3C. The Grifo years were also the years of the Chevrolet Testudo, driven personally by Nuccio Bertone to the Geneva Motor Show in 1963. The following year, they created the Alfa Romeo Canguro, followed in 1965 by the Alfa Romeo Giulia GT.

In 1965, Bertone launched the Fiat 850 Spider. The commercial success of this model led Nuccio Bertone to increase the company&#x27;s production capacity to 120 units per day. Between 1965 and 1972, nearly 140,000 were produced, the great majority of which were sold in the United States. With the Fiat 850, the company increased its production volumes, from 13,000 units produced in 1966 to nearly 30,000 in 1968.

At the end of the 1960s, they formed a partnership with Ferruccio Lamborghini. The first vehicle to come out of this was the Lamborghini Miura. The Miura was followed by the Marzal in 1967 and the Espada in 1968. In the same period, two other coupés appeared: the Alfa Romeo Montreal and the Fiat Dino Coupé, both out in 1967. At the Paris Motor Show of 1968, Bertone presented the Carabo concept car, based on an Alfa 33 chassis. By 1970, Bertone had a workforce of 1,500 staff, and the Grugliasco factory covered an area of . The partnership with Lamborghini led to the development of the Lamborghini Espada. The design was inspired by the Jaguar Pirana. After his initial success with the Espada, he went on to design the Lamborghini Jarama and the Lamborghini Urraco.

In 1972, Giovanni Bertone died. In that year, as a tribute to the company&#x27;s founder, the Maserati Khamsin and the Fiat X1/9 were released. Based on the Fiat 128 chassis but with a mid-rear-engine layout, the X1/9 was in production from 1972 to 1988, with 160,000 units manufactured. The company also began working for Volvo on the 264 TE. The Volvo 262C was presented at the 1977 Geneva Motor Show. From the start of the 1980s, the Fiat Ritmo Cabrio and the Fiat X1/9 were produced and sold directly under the Bertone brand. In 1982, Marcello Gandini turned out the Citroën BX. A new commercial agreement drawn up with General Motors Europe in 1986 saw the production of the Kadett Cabrio handed over to Bertone. In 1993, the Opel Astra Cabrio and the Fiat Punto Cabrio began production. Next year, Bertone presented the Zero Emission Record (ZER); Gruppo Bertone was also awarded the ISO 9001 quality certification.

=== 2000s – present ===

By 2009, a worsening financial situation caused Bertone to sell its Grugliasco plant, along with its manufacturing activities, to FIAT. Bertone underwent a major restructuring process. By then, the Bertone workforce had dropped to roughly 300 people, mainly engineers and designers. The financial situation continued, prompting Bertone to sell off some of its concept cars in 2011. After having ceased trading because of financial difficulties, Bertone, on 18 March 2014, confirmed that it would be declared bankrupt if a suitable buyer was not found by the end of April.

In May 2013, the license rights to the brand were granted by Bertone Cento to Bertone Design. They also formed a partnership with Citroën, but since the 2013 acquisition of the name, a car prototype or series was never made.

In June 2016, the Bertone brand was acquired for more than by AKKA Technologies, an engineering company. The rights to use the brand, however, were shared with Bertone Design which does not have the authorization to use it in the automotive field. Starting from November 2018, AKKA Technologies sold the license to use the Bertone brand in the electric automotive sector to Flymove Holding Limited UK, which in May 2019 proceeded with the definitive purchase of the brand for all applications and sectors. They relaunched Bertone through the presentation of new models of electric cars designed by Carlos Arroyo Turon (former Bertone Designer) and which use the battery swap system.
The AKKA Technologies group subsequently sold the Bertone brand to Ideactive, a company owned by Mauro and Jean-Franck Ricci. In 2022, the two Ricci brothers revived the Bertone brand. The first in a series of limited edition vehicles, the GB110, was launched in December 2022. In June 2024, the Bertone GB110 was publicly unveiled at Top Marques Monaco.

<text>The Grumman A-6 Intruder is a twinjet all-weather attack aircraft developed and manufactured by American aircraft company Grumman Aerospace. It was formerly operated by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.

The A-6 was designed in response to a 1957 requirement issued by the Bureau of Aeronautics for an all-weather attack aircraft for Navy long-range interdiction missions and with short takeoff and landing (STOL) capability for Marine close air support. It was to replace the piston-engined Douglas A-1 Skyraider. The requirement allowed either single or twin-engined aircraft, as well as either turbojet or turboprop-based engines. The winning proposal from Grumman was powered by a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney J52 turbojet engines. The A-6 was the first U.S. Navy aircraft to have an integrated airframe and weapons system. Operated by a crew of two in a side-by-side seating configuration, the workload was divided between the pilot and weapons officer (bombardier/navigator or BN). In addition to conventional munitions, it could also carry nuclear weapons, which would be delivered using toss bombing techniques.

On 19 April 1960, the first prototype made its maiden flight; the type was introduced to squadron service during February 1963. The A-6 was operated by both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as their principal all-weather/night attack aircraft between 1963 and 1997, during which time multiple variants were developed and introduced. One derivative of the type was the EA-6B Prowler, a specialized electronic warfare aircraft. Another was the KA-6D, a dedicated aerial refueling tanker. The definitive attack version of the aircraft, which was furnished with vastly upgraded navigation and attack systems, was the A-6E. While the development of further variants, such as the A-6F, were explored, they ultimately did not come to fruition.

The A-6 saw active combat across multiple conflicts. Its combat debut was the Vietnam War, in which the type operated from both carriers and shore facilities. The type proved vulnerable to conventional ground fire and AAA, which was attributed with the downing of 56 A-6s. In the 1980s, both the Multinational Force in Lebanon and Operation El Dorado Canyon made use of the type. During the Gulf War, a combination of U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps A-6s conducted in excess of 4,700 combat sorties against a variety of Iraqi ground-based targets. During the 1990s, the A-6 was intended to be superseded by the McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II, but this program was ultimately canceled due to cost overruns. Thus, when the A-6E was scheduled for retirement, its precision strike mission was initially taken over by the Grumman F-14 Tomcat equipped with a LANTIRN pod, and later passed on to the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.

==Development==
===Background===
As a result of the fair-weather limitation of the propeller-driven A-1 Skyraider in the Korean War and the advent of turbine engines, the United States Navy issued preliminary requirements in 1955 for an all-weather carrier-based attack aircraft. The U.S. Navy published an Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for it in October 1956. It released a Request For Proposals (RFP) in February 1957. The RFP called for a &#x27;close air support attack bomber capable of hitting the enemy at any time&#x27;. Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist observe that this specification was shaped by the service&#x27;s Korean War experiences, during which air support had been frequently unavailable unless fair weather conditions were present.

In response to the RFP, a total of eleven design proposals were submitted by eight different companies, including Bell, Boeing, Douglas, Grumman, Lockheed, Martin, North American, and Vought. Grumman&#x27;s submission was internally designated as the &quot;Type G-128&quot;. Following evaluation of the bids, the U.S. Navy announced the selection of Grumman on 2 January 1958. The company was awarded a contract for the development of their submission, which had been re-designated &quot;A2F-1&quot;, in February 1958.
Grumman&#x27;s design team was led by Robert Nafis and Lawrence Mead, Jr. Mead later played a lead role in the design of the Lunar Excursion Module and the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. The team was spread between two sites, the company&#x27;s manufacturing plant at Bethpage and the testing facilities at Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant, Calverton. During September 1959, the design was approved by the Mock-Up Review Board.

The A2F-1 design incorporated several cutting-edge features for the era. In the early 1960s, it was novel for a fighter-sized aircraft to have sophisticated avionics that used multiple computers. This design experience was taken into consideration by NASA in their November 1962 decision to choose Grumman over other companies like General Dynamics-Convair (the F-111 had computerized avionics capabilities comparable to the A-6, but did not fly until 1964) to build the Lunar Excursion Module, which was a small-sized spacecraft with two onboard computers.

===Test program===
The first prototype YA2F-1, lacking radar and the navigational and attack avionics, made its first flight on 19 April 1960, with the second prototype flying on 28 July 1960.

The test program required to develop the aircraft took a long time. The very advanced navigation and attack equipment required a lot of development and changes had to be made to correct aerodynamic deficiencies and remove unwanted features. Extending the air brakes, which were mounted on the rear fuselage, changed the downwash at the horizontal tailplane which overloaded its actuator so the tailplane was moved rearwards by . Later evaluation of the aircraft showed that the airbrakes were not effective enough in controlling the speed of the aircraft and they were moved to the wing-tips. Early production aircraft were fitted with both the fuselage and wingtip air brakes, although the fuselage-mounted ones were soon disabled, and were removed from later aircraft. The trailing edge of each wing-tip split to form a much more effective speed-brake which projected above and below the wing when extended.

The rudder needed a wider chord at its base to give greater exposed area to assist spin recovery.

A major difference between the first six production aircraft and subsequent aircraft were the jet nozzles; the close-air support role sought by the U.S. Marine Corps required STOL performance to operate from forward airstrips. Jet deflection using tilting tailpipes was proposed. The performance benefits from varying the angle were not worthwhile, whether operating from short strips or carriers, thus they were fixed at a seven degree downward angle.

===Further development===
During February 1963, the A-6 was introduced to service with the US Navy; at this point, the type was, according to Gunston and Gilchrist, &quot;the first genuinely all-weather attack bomber in history&quot;. However, early operating experiences found the aircraft to be imposing very high maintenance demands, particularly in the Asian theatre of operations, and serviceability figures were also low. In response, the Naval Avionics Lab launched a substantial and lengthy program to improve both the reliability and performance of the A-6&#x27;s avionics suite. The successful performance of the A-6 in operations following these improvements ended proposals to produce follow-on models that featured downgraded avionics.

Various specialized variants of the A-6 were developed, often in response to urgent military requirements raised during the Vietnam War. The &quot;A-6C&quot;, a dedicated interdictor, was one such model, as was the &quot;KA-6D&quot;, a buddy store-equipped aerial refueling tanker. Perhaps the most complex variant was the EA-6B Prowler, a specialized electronic warfare derivative. The last variant to be produced was the &quot;A-6E&quot;, first introduced in 1972; it features extensive avionics improvements, including the new APQ-148 multimode radar, along with minor airframe refinements. The last A-6E was delivered in 1992.

In the early 1980s, the Navy anticipated that an Advanced Carrier-Borne Multirole Fighter (VFMX) would eventually be the long term high-end replacement for both the F-14 and A-6, although this program was short-lived and was succeeded by separate efforts for fleet air defense and deep strike/attack; the latter became the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program resulting in the development of the McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II. Meanwhile, a further model, designated &quot;A-6F&quot;, was being planned. Intended to feature the General Electric F404 turbofan engine, as well as various avionics and airframe improvements, this variant was cancelled under the presumption that the A-12 would be entering production before long. Instead, a life-extension program involving the re-winging of existing A-6E aircraft was undertaken; initially a metal wing had been used before a graphite-epoxy composite wing was developed during the late 1980s. Other improvements were introduced to the fleet around this time, including GPS receivers, new computers and radar sets, more efficient J-52-409 engines, as well as increased compatibility with various additional missiles.

==Design==
The Grumman A-6 Intruder is a two-seat twin-engined monoplane, equipped to perform carrier-based attack missions regardless of prevailing weather or light conditions. The cockpit used an unusual double pane windscreen and side-by-side seating arrangement in which the pilot sat in the left seat, while the bombardier/navigator (BN) sat to the right and slightly below to give the pilot an adequate view on that side. In addition to a radar display for the BN, a unique instrumentation feature for the pilot was a cathode ray tube screen that was known as the Vertical Display Indicator (VDI). This display provided a synthetic representation of the world in front of the aircraft, along with steering cues provided by the BN, enabling head-down navigation and attack at night and in all weather conditions.

The A-6&#x27;s wing was relatively efficient at subsonic speeds, particularly when compared to supersonic fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, which are also limited to subsonic speeds when carrying a payload of bombs. The wing was also designed to provide a favorable level of maneuverability even while carrying a sizable bomb load. A very similar wing would be put on pivots on Grumman&#x27;s later supersonic swing-wing Grumman F-14 Tomcat, as well as similar landing gear.

For its day, the Intruder had sophisticated avionics, with a high degree of integration. To aid in identifying and isolating equipment malfunctions, the aircraft was provided with automatic diagnostic systems, some of the earliest computer-based analytic equipment developed for aircraft. These were known as Basic Automated Checkout Equipment, or BACE (pronounced &quot;base&quot;). There were two levels, known as &quot;Line BACE&quot; to identify specific malfunctioning systems in the aircraft, while in the hangar or on the flight line; and &quot;Shop BACE&quot;, to exercise and analyze individual malfunctioning systems in the maintenance shop. This equipment was manufactured by Litton Industries. Together, the BACE systems greatly reduced the Maintenance Man-Hours per Flight Hour, a key index of the cost and effort needed to keep military aircraft operating.

The Intruder was equipped to carry nuclear weapons (B43, B57, B61) which would have been delivered using semi-automated toss bombing.

==Operational history==
===Entering service and Vietnam War===

The Intruder received a new standardized US DoD designation of &quot;A-6A&quot; in the Autumn of 1962, and entered squadron service in February 1963. The A-6 became both the U.S. Navy&#x27;s and U.S. Marine Corps&#x27;s principal medium and all-weather/night attack aircraft from the mid-1960s through the 1990s and as an aerial tanker either in the dedicated KA-6D version or by use of a buddy store (D-704). Whereas the A-6 fulfilled the USN and USMC all-weather ground-attack/strike mission role, this mission in the USAF was served by the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and later the F-111, the latter which also saw its earlier F-111A variants converted to a radar jammer as the EF-111 Raven, analogous to the USN and USMC EA-6B Prowler.

A-6 Intruders first saw action during the Vietnam War, where the craft were used extensively against targets in Vietnam. The aircraft&#x27;s long range and heavy payload () coupled with its ability to fly in all weather made it invaluable during the war. However, its typical mission profile of flying low to deliver its payload made it especially vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire, and in the eight years the Intruder was used during the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps lost a total of 84 A-6 aircraft of various series. The first loss occurred on 14 July 1965 when an Intruder from VA-75 operating from , flown by LT Donald Boecker and LT Donald Eaton, commenced a dive on a target near Laos. An explosion under the starboard wing damaged the starboard engine, causing the aircraft to catch fire and the hydraulics to fail. Seconds later the port engine failed, the controls froze, and the two crewmen ejected. Both crewmen survived.
Of the 84 Intruders lost to all causes during the war, ten were shot down by surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), two were shot down by MiGs, 16 were lost to operational causes, and 56 were lost to conventional ground fire and AAA. The last Intruder to be lost during the war was from VA-35, flown by LT C. M. Graf and LT S. H. Hatfield, operating from ; they were shot down by ground fire on 24 January 1973 while providing close air support. The airmen ejected and were rescued by a Navy helicopter. Twenty U.S. Navy aircraft carriers rotated through the waters of Southeast Asia, providing air strikes, from the early 1960s through the early 1970s. Nine of those carriers lost A-6 Intruders: lost 11, lost eight, lost six, lost two, USS &quot;Independence&quot; lost four, lost 14, lost three, lost eight, and USS &quot;America&quot; lost two. Although capable of embarking aboard aircraft carriers, most U.S. Marine Corps A-6 Intruders were shore based in South Vietnam at Chu Lai and Da Nang and in Nam Phong, Thailand.

===Lebanon and later action===
A-6 Intruders were later used in support of other operations, such as the Multinational Force in Lebanon in 1983. On 4 December, one LTV A-7 Corsair II and one Intruder were downed by Syrian missiles. The Intruder&#x27;s pilot, Lieutenant Mark Lange, and bombardier/navigator Lieutenant Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Goodman ejected immediately before the crash; Lange died of his injuries while Goodman was captured and taken by the Syrians to Damascus where he was released on 3 January 1984. Later in the 1980s, two Naval Reserve A-7 Corsair II light attack squadrons, VA-205 and VA-304, were reconstituted as medium attack squadrons with the A-6E at NAS Atlanta, Georgia and NAS Alameda, California, respectively.

Intruders also saw action in April 1986 operating from the aircraft carriers USS &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Coral Sea&quot; during the bombing of Libya (Operation El Dorado Canyon). The squadrons involved were VA-34 &quot;Blue Blasters&quot; (from USS &quot;America&quot;) and VA-55 &quot;Warhorses&quot; (from USS &quot;Coral Sea&quot;).
During the Gulf War in 1991, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps A-6s flew more than 4,700 combat sorties, providing close air support, destroying enemy air defenses, attacking Iraqi naval units, and hitting strategic targets. They were also the U.S. Navy&#x27;s primary strike platform for delivering laser-guided bombs. The U.S. Navy operated them from the aircraft carriers , , USS &quot;Midway&quot;, USS &quot;Ranger&quot;, USS &quot;America&quot; and , while U.S. Marine Corps A-6s operated ashore, primarily from Shaikh Isa Air Base in Bahrain. Three A-6s were shot down in combat by SAMs and AAA.

The Intruder&#x27;s large blunt nose and slender tail inspired a number of nicknames, including &quot;Double Ugly&quot;, &quot;The Mighty Alpha Six&quot;, &quot;Iron Tadpole&quot; and also &quot;Drumstick&quot;.

Following the Gulf War, Intruders were used to patrol the no-fly zone in Iraq and provided air support for U.S. Marines during Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. The last A-6E Intruder left U.S. Marine Corps service on 28 April 1993. Navy A-6s saw further duty over Bosnia in 1994.

On 4 June 1996, during RIMPAC a US Navy A-6E performing the unusual target towing task to train Japanese Navy air defense crews was mistakenly engaged and shot down by the Japanese destroyer JS Yūgiri with its Phalanx CIWS gun. Both the pilot and BN ejected and were recovered.

===Retirement===
Despite the production of new airframes in the 164XXX Bureau Number (BuNo) series just before and after the Gulf War, augmented by a rewinging program of older airframes, the A-6E and KA-6D were quickly phased out of service in the mid-1990s in a U.S. Navy cost-cutting move driven by the Office of the Secretary of Defense to reduce the number of different type/model/series (T/M/S) of aircraft in carrier air wings and U.S. Marine aircraft groups.

The A-6 was intended to be replaced by the McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II, but that program was canceled due to cost overruns. The Intruder remained in service for a few more years before being retired in favor of the LANTIRN-equipped F-14D Tomcat, which was in turn replaced by the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in the U.S. Navy and the twin-seat F/A-18D Hornet in the U.S. Marine Corps. During the 2010s, the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program was at one point intended to produce an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) successor to the Intruder&#x27;s long-distance strike role, but the initiative has since changed priorities towards the tanker mission instead. The last Intruders were retired on 28 February 1997.

Many in the US defense establishment in general, and Naval Aviation in particular, questioned the wisdom of a shift to a shorter range carrier-based strike force, as represented by the Hornet and Super Hornet, compared to the older generation aircraft such as the Intruder and Tomcat. However, the availability of USAF Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender tankers modified to accommodate USN, USMC and NATO tactical aircraft in all recent conflicts was considered by certain senior decision makers in the Department of Defense to put a lesser premium on organic aerial refueling capability in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s carrier air wings and self-contained range among carrier-based strike aircraft. Although the Intruder could not match the F-14&#x27;s or the F/A-18&#x27;s speed or air-combat capability, the A-6&#x27;s range and load-carrying ability are still unmatched by newer aircraft in the fleet.

At the time of retirement, several retired A-6 airframes were awaiting rewinging at the Northrop Grumman facility at St. Augustine Airport, Florida; these were later sunk off the coast of St. Johns County, Florida to form a fish haven named &quot;Intruder Reef&quot;. Surviving aircraft fitted with the new wings, and later production aircraft (i.e., BuNo 164XXX series) not earmarked for museum or non-flying static display were stored at the AMARG storage center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona.

==Variants==
===YA-6A and A-6A===
The eight prototypes and pre-production Intruder aircraft were sometimes referred to with the &quot;YA-6A&quot; designation. These were used in the development and testing of the A-6A Intruder.

The initial version of the Intruder was built around the complex and advanced &quot;DIANE&quot; (Digital Integrated Attack/Navigation Equipment) suite, intended to provide a high degree of bombing accuracy even at night and in poor weather. DIANE consisted of multiple radar systems: the Norden Systems AN/APQ-92 search radar replacing the YA-6A&#x27;s AN/APQ-88, and a separate AN/APG-46 for tracking, the AN/APN-141 radar altimeter, and an AN/APN-122 Doppler navigational radar to provide position updates to the Litton AN/ASN-31 inertial navigation system. An air-data computer and the AN/ASQ-61 ballistics computer integrated the radar information for the bombardier/navigator in the right-hand seat. TACAN and ADF systems were also provided for navigation. When it worked, DIANE was perhaps the most capable navigation/attack system of its era, giving the Intruder the ability to fly and fight in even very poor conditions (particularly important over Vietnam and Thailand during the Vietnam War). It suffered numerous teething problems, and it was several years before its reliability was established.
Total A-6A production was 480, excluding the prototype and pre-production aircraft. A total of 47 A-6As were converted to other variants.

===A-6B===
To provide U.S. Navy squadrons with a defense suppression aircraft to attack enemy anti-aircraft defense and SAM systems, a mission dubbed &quot;Iron Hand&quot; by the U.S. Navy, 19 A-6As were converted to &quot;A-6B&quot; version during 1967 to 1970. The A-6B had many of its standard attack systems removed in favor of specialized equipment to detect and track enemy radar sites and to guide AGM-45 Shrike and AGM-78 Standard anti-radiation missiles, with AN/APQ-103 radar replacing earlier AN/APQ-92 used in the A-6A, plus AN/APN-153 navigational radar replacing earlier AN/APN-122, again used in the A-6A.

Between 1968 and 1977, several Intruder squadrons operated A-6Bs alongside their regular A-6As. Five were lost to all causes, and the surviving aircraft were later converted to &quot;A-6E&quot; standard in the late 1970s.

===A-6C===
12 A-6As were converted in 1970 to &quot;A-6C&quot; standard for night attack missions against the Ho Chi Minh trail in Vietnam. They were fitted with a &quot;Trails/Roads Interdiction Multi-sensor&quot; (TRIM) pod in the fuselage for FLIR and low-light TV cameras, as well as a &quot;Black Crow&quot; engine ignition detection system. Radars were also upgraded, with the AN/APQ-112 replacing the earlier AN/APQ-103, and an AN/APN-186 navigational radar replacing the earlier AN/APN-153. A vastly improved Sperry Corporation AN/APQ-127 radar replaced the AN/APG-46 fire control radar. One of these aircraft was lost in combat; the others were later refitted to A-6E standard after the war.

===KA-6D===
To replace both the KA-3B and EA-3B Skywarrior during the early 1970s, 78 A-6As and 12 A-6Es were converted for use as tanker aircraft, providing aerial refueling support to other strike aircraft. The DIANE system was removed and an internal refueling system was added, sometimes supplemented by a D-704 refueling pod on the centerline pylon. The KA-6D theoretically could be used in the day/visual bombing role, but it apparently never was, with the standard load-out being four fuel tanks. Because it was based on a tactical aircraft platform, the KA-6D provided a capability for mission tanking, the ability to keep up with strike aircraft and refuel them in the course of a mission. A few KA-6Ds went to sea with each Intruder squadron. Their operation was integrated into the Intruder squadrons, as A-6 crew were trained to operate both aircraft and the NATOPS covered both the A6 and KA-6D. These aircraft were always in short supply, and frequently were &quot;cross decked&quot; from a returning carrier to an outgoing one. Many KA-6 airframes had severe G restrictions, as well as fuselage stretching due to almost continual use and high number of catapults and traps. The retirement of the aircraft left a gap in US Navy and Marine Corps refueling tanker capability. At least 16 KA-6Ds served in the Gulf War. The Navy Lockheed S-3 Viking filled that gap until the new F/A-18E/F Super Hornet became operational.

===A-6E===
The definitive attack version of the Intruder with vastly upgraded navigation and attack systems, introduced in 1970 and first deployed on 9 December 1971. The earlier separate search and track (fire control) radars of the A-6A/B/C were replaced by a single Norden AN/APQ-148 multi-mode radar, and onboard computers with a more sophisticated (and generally more reliable) IC based system, as opposed to the A-6A&#x27;s DIANE discrete transistor-based technology. A new AN/ASN-92 inertial navigation system was added, along with the CAINS (Carrier Aircraft Inertial Navigation System), for greater navigation accuracy.
Beginning in 1979, all A-6Es were fitted with the AN/AAS-33 DRS (Detecting and Ranging Set), part of the &#x27;Target Recognition and Attack Multi-Sensor&#x27; (TRAM) system, a small, gyroscopically stabilized turret, mounted under the nose of the aircraft, containing a forward-looking infra-red (FLIR) boresighted with a laser spot-tracker/designator and IBM AN/ASQ-155 computer. TRAM was matched with a new Norden AN/APQ-156 radar. The BN could use both TRAM imagery and radar data for extremely accurate attacks, or use the TRAM sensors alone to attack without using the Intruder&#x27;s radar (which might warn the target). TRAM also allowed the Intruder to autonomously designate and drop laser-guided bombs. In addition, the Intruder used an Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI), which allowed the aircraft to track a moving target (such as a tank or truck) and drop ordnance on it even though the target was moving. Also, the computer system allowed the use of Offset Aim Point (OAP), giving the crew the ability to drop on a target unseen on radar by noting coordinates of a known target nearby and entering the offset range and bearing to the unseen target.

In the 1980s, the A-6E TRAM aircraft were converted to the A-6E &#x27;Weapons Control System Improvement&#x27; (WCSI) version to extend weapons capability. This added the ability to carry and target some of the first generation precision guided weapons, like the AGM-84 Harpoon missile, and AGM-123 Skipper. WCSI equipped aircraft were eventually modified to have a limited capability to use the AGM-84E SLAM standoff land attack missile. Since the Harpoon and SLAM missiles had common communication interfaces, WCSI aircraft could carry and fire SLAM missiles, but needed a nearby A-6E SWIP to guide them to target.
In the early 1990s, some surviving A-6Es were upgraded under SWIP (Systems/Weapons Improvement Program) to enable them to use the latest precision-guided munitions, including AGM-65 Mavericks, AGM-84E SLAMs, AGM-62 Walleyes and the AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missile as well as additional capability with the AGM-84 Harpoon. A co-processor was added to the AN/ASQ-155 computer system to implement the needed MIL-STD-1553 digital interfaces to the pylons, as well as an additional control panel. After a series of wing-fatigue problems, about 85% of the fleet was fitted with new graphite/epoxy/titanium/aluminum composite wings. The new wings proved to be a mixed blessing, as a composite wing is stiffer and transmits more force to the fuselage, accelerating fatigue in the fuselage. In 1990, the decision was made to terminate production of the A-6. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the A-6 had been in low-rate production of four or five new aircraft a year, enough to replace mostly accidental losses. The final production order was for 20 aircraft of the SWIP configuration with composite wings, delivered in 1993.

A-6E models totaled 445 aircraft, about 240 of which were converted from earlier A-6A/B/C models.

===A-6F and A-6G===
An advanced &quot;A-6F Intruder II&quot; was proposed in the mid-1980s that would have replaced the Intruder&#x27;s elderly Pratt &amp; Whitney J52 turbojets with non-afterburning versions of the General Electric F404 turbofan used in the F/A-18 Hornet, providing substantial improvements in both power and fuel economy. The A-6F would have had totally new avionics, including a Norden AN/APQ-173 synthetic aperture radar and multi-function cockpit displays – the APQ-173 would have given the Intruder air-to-air capacity with provision for the AIM-120 AMRAAM. Two additional wing pylons were added, for a total of seven stations.

Although five development aircraft were built, the U.S. Navy ultimately chose not to authorize the A-6F, preferring to concentrate on the A-12 Avenger II. This left the service in a quandary when the A-12 was canceled in 1991.

Grumman proposed a cheaper alternative in the &quot;A-6G&quot;, which had most of the A-6F&#x27;s advanced electronics, but retained the existing engines. This, too, was canceled.

===Electronic warfare versions===

An electronic warfare (EW)/Electronic countermeasures (ECW) version of the Intruder was developed early in the aircraft&#x27;s life for the USMC, which needed a new ECM platform to replace its elderly F3D-2Q Skyknights. An EW version of the Intruder, initially designated &quot;A2F-1H&quot; (rather than A2F-1Q, as &quot;Q&quot; was being split to relegate it to passive electronic warfare and &quot;H&quot; to active) and subsequently redesignated &quot;EA-6A&quot;, first flew on 26 April 1963. It had a Bunker-Ramo AN/ALQ-86 ECM suite, with most electronics contained on the walnut-shaped pod atop the vertical fin. They were equipped with AN/APQ-129 fire control radar, and theoretically capable of firing the AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missile, although they were apparently not used in that role. The navigational radar is AN/APN-153.

Only 28 EA-6As were built (two prototypes, 15 new-build, and 11 conversions from A-6As), serving with U.S. Marine Corps squadrons in Vietnam. It was phased out of front line service in the mid-1970s, remaining in use in reserve VMCJ units with the USMC and then the United States Navy in specialized VAQ units, primarily for training purposes. The last EA-6A had been retired by 1993.

A much more highly specialized derivative of the Intruder was the EA-6B Prowler, having a &quot;stretched&quot; airframe with two additional systems operators, and more comprehensive systems for the electronic warfare and SEAD roles. A derivative of AN/APQ-156, AN/APS-130 was installed as the main radar for EA-6B. The navigational radar was upgraded to AN/APS-133 from the AN/APN-153 on EA-6A. In total, 170 were produced. The EA-6B took on the duties of the U.S. Air Force EF-111 Raven when the DoD decided to let the U.S. Navy handle all electronic warfare missions. The Prowler has been replaced by the EA-18G Growler in the U.S. Navy and was retired from USMC service in 2019.

<text>Colin Stuart Montgomerie, OBE (born 23 June 1963) is a Scottish professional golfer. He has won a record eight European Tour Order of Merit titles, including a streak of seven consecutive ones from 1993 to 1999. He has won 31 European Tour events, the most of any British player, placing him fourth on the all-time list of golfers with most European Tour victories.

Montgomerie won three consecutive Volvo PGA Championships at Wentworth Club between 1998 and 2000. He has finished runner-up on five occasions in major championships and his career-high world ranking is second. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2013.

After turning 50 in 2013, Montgomerie has had a successful career on the PGA Tour Champions and European Senior Tour, including winning three senior major championships.

==Early life==
Although Scottish by birth and ancestry, he was raised in Yorkshire, England, where his father, James Montgomerie, was Managing Director of Fox&#x27;s Biscuits. He spent a number of years with the Ilkley Golf Club, where he was tutored by the past professional Bill Ferguson. He was educated at both Leeds Grammar School and Strathallan School, Perthshire. During his time in Leeds, he became a supporter of Leeds United. His father later became the secretary of Royal Troon Golf Club, one of Scotland&#x27;s most famous clubs.

==Amateur career==
Montgomerie became one of the first British golfers to go to a United States college, attending Houston Baptist University, where he played on the golf team and became its top player. He won three important Scottish amateur tournaments – the 1983 Scottish Youths Championship, the 1985 Scottish Amateur Stroke Play Championship and the 1987 Scottish Amateur Championship.

He played for Great Britain and Ireland twice in the Eisenhower Trophy (1984 and 1986) and twice in the Walker Cup (1985 and 1987). He was also part of the Scottish team, winning the 1985 European Amateur Team Championship at Halmstad Golf Club, North Course, in Sweden. Before turning pro he considered a career in sports management, utilizing his degree in business management and law; the interview process included a golf outing that convinced the firm he should become a client rather than an employee.

==Professional career==
Montgomerie turned professional before the 1988 season and was named the Rookie of the Year on the European Tour that year. He quickly developed into one of Europe&#x27;s top pros, winning his first event at the 1989 Portuguese Open TPC by 11 shots, and his second, beating a world class field, at the 1991 Scandinavian Masters at Royal Drottningholm Golf Club in Sweden. He made his Ryder Cup debut later in 1991. He finished first on the European Tour Order of Merit every year from 1993 to 1999 (a record for most consecutive Orders of Merit), and has 31 victories on the tour, including the 1998, 1999, and 2000 Volvo PGA Championships at Wentworth, England. However, despite many near-misses, Montgomerie was unable to win on the PGA Tour.

Montgomerie first reached the top-10 in the Official World Golf Rankings in 1994, and spent 400 weeks in the top-10. His highest ranking was number two. In his prime Montgomerie was considered one of the best drivers of the golf ball in the world and became a very precise iron player, often able to judge the distance he hit the ball exactly from long range.

Montgomerie came first in the Volvo Bonus Pool every year from 1993 to 1998. The Volvo Bonus Pool was an extra tranche of prize money awarded at the end of each European Tour season from 1988 to 1998 to the regular members of the tour who had had the best performances over the season.

His form fell away gradually in the new millennium, partly due to marriage problems, and his ranking slumped to 82nd in the world, but he came back strongly in 2005, winning a record eighth European Tour Order of Merit and returning to the top ten in the World Rankings. Late in 2005 he became the first man to win 20 million Euros on the European Tour—topping the European Tour&#x27;s all-time highest earners list. He won for the first time in nearly two years at the Smurfit Kappa European Open in July 2007. In 2008, Montgomerie slipped out of the top 100 players in the world ranking system. A runner-up finish at the 2008 French Open in June boosted him back up the rankings, but his good play was short-lived, and as a result Montgomerie failed to qualify for Nick Faldo&#x27;s 2008 Ryder Cup team. In March 2009, Montgomerie played in his milestone 500th European Tour event at the Open de Andalucia where he made the cut, but was not in contention during the weekend. He remained the leader in career earnings on the European Tour until 2010, when he was surpassed by Ernie Els.

After nearly two years without a top-10 finish, Montgomerie posted a final round of 68 for a share of 7th place in the 2011 BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. Despite the drop in form, his influence remained strong. In 2012, Montgomerie was named by the Golf Club Managers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Golf Club Management magazine as the seventh most powerful person in British golf. In August 2012, Montgomerie finished tied for 6th at the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles, his highest finish in over four years.

In June 2013, after turning 50, Montgomerie joined the Champions Tour, where he made his debut in the Constellation Senior Players Championship, one of the five senior major championships. On 25 May 2014, Montgomerie won his first senior major championship at the Senior PGA Championship. He followed this up on 13 July 2014, when he claimed his second senior major at the U.S. Senior Open. On 24 May 2015, Montgomerie defended his Senior PGA Championship title to win his third senior major. However, in 2016 he narrowly missed out on making it three Senior PGA Championships in a row – finishing second and three shots behind winner Rocco Mediate. He won twice on the senior circuit in 2017, winning the inaugural Japan Airlines Championship before claiming his sixth Champions Tour win at the SAS Championship. His most recent victory came at the Invesco QQQ Championship in 2019.

==Form at major championships==
Montgomerie is generally considered to be one of the best golfers never to have won a major championship, after finishing in second place on five separate occasions. During what most consider to be his best years in the 1990s Montgomerie had several close shaves. A third place at the 1992 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach Golf Links was the first of these. He was prematurely congratulated by Jack Nicklaus who said &quot;Congratulations on your first U.S. Open victory&quot; to Montgomerie after he finished the 18th hole on Sunday. Tom Kite, who was still on the golf course when Montgomerie finished, wound up winning the championship.

At the 1994 U.S. Open, played at Oakmont Country Club, Montgomerie lost in a three-man playoff to Ernie Els (a playoff which also included Loren Roberts). Montgomerie shot 78 to trail the 74s shot by Els and Roberts, with Els winning at the 20th extra hole.

At the 1995 PGA Championship, Montgomerie birdied the final three holes of the Riviera Country Club course in the final round, to tie Steve Elkington at 17 under par, which was a record low score in a major championship. On the first sudden-death playoff hole, after being in better position after two shots, Montgomerie missed his putt, while Elkington holed from 35 feet to claim the title.

Els defeated Montgomerie at the 1997 U.S. Open, played at Congressional Country Club. Montgomerie opened the tournament with a 65 but shot a 76 in the second round. A bogey on the 71st hole dropped Montgomerie one shot behind Els, who parred the last to win.

At the 2006 U.S. Open, played on the West course of the Winged Foot Golf Club, Montgomerie had yet another chance to win his first major championship. He stood in the middle of the 18th fairway in the final round having sunk a 50-foot birdie putt on the 17th green, which put him in the joint lead with Phil Mickelson. While waiting in position on the 18th fairway for the group in front to finish, Montgomerie switched his club from a 6-iron to a 7-iron, assuming adrenaline would kick in. Once the wait was over, he hit the approach shot poorly, ending up short and right of the green, in thick rough. He pitched onto the green, and then three-putted from 30 feet to lose the tournament by one stroke. After the loss, Montgomerie said, &quot;At my age I&#x27;ve got to think positively. I&#x27;m 43 next week, and it&#x27;s nice I can come back to this tournament and do well again, and I look forward to coming back here again next year and trying another U.S. Open disaster.&quot; Geoff Ogilvy won the championship.

Montgomerie&#x27;s best finish in the Masters Tournament came in 1998 when he finished tied for 8th.

At The Open Championship in 2001 at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club, Montgomerie started brightly with an opening 65, and still remained ahead after 36 holes, but he fell away over the weekend. He was also in contention with two rounds to play at Muirfield in 2002 and Royal Troon Golf Club in 2004, but failed to capitalise and finished midway down the field. His best finish in the Championship came in 2005 at St Andrews, where he finished second to Tiger Woods, who beat him by five shots.

In 2016, Montgomerie came through Open Qualifying at Gailes Links to qualify for his home Open at Royal Troon. He had the honour of hitting the opening tee shot at the tournament and ended up making the cut.

Following Sergio García&#x27;s victory at the 2017 Masters, Montgomerie (with 75 starts) trailed only Jay Haas (87) and Lee Westwood (76) as the player with the most starts without a major title.

==Ryder Cup and other golf==

Despite his disappointments in the majors, Montgomerie is heralded as one of the greatest Ryder Cup players of all time. To date he has been a member of the European team on eight occasions, and has never lost in a singles match. He holds a win-lose-draw record of 20–9–7, thus giving him a total points scored tally of 23.5, only 2 points behind the all-time record held by Sergio García. He has played pivotal roles in several of the matches. He halved the last hole with Scott Hoch to obtain the half-point that won Europe the cup in 1997, and sank the winning putt, in what is considered to be his finest hour in the 2004 staging of the event.

Montgomerie was not part of Nick Faldo&#x27;s 2008 Ryder Cup team, with the wildcards going to Paul Casey and Ian Poulter. Montgomerie captained the Great Britain and Ireland team in the first four stagings of the Seve Trophy, losing in 2000 but winning in 2002, 2003, and 2005.

On 28 January 2009, it was announced that Montgomerie would be the captain the European team at the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor. On 4 October 2010, Montgomerie led the European team to victory, 14 to 13. On the same day he also announced that he would be stepping down as captain of the European Team. In December 2010, he accepted the BBC Sports Personality Coach of the Year award as captain of the victorious Ryder Cup team.

Montgomerie has been the playing captain of the European team in the Royal Trophy, played against a team from Asia. Europe was successful on both those occasions. He has the distinction having been a victorious player and captain in the Ryder Cup, Seve Trophy and Royal Trophy.

In 2011, Montgomerie was named president of the English junior golf charity, the Golf Foundation, and in 2012 the Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, named him as an ambassador for the Scottish junior golf programme, ClubGolf.

In March 2015, Montgomerie accepted the captaincy of &quot;London Scottish Golf Club&quot; in Wimbledon to mark that club&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

Montgomerie was also a columnist for the Scottish golf magazine, &quot;Bunkered&quot;, between 2008 and 2010.

==OBE==
At the end of 2004, Montgomerie was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year&#x27;s Honours. He represents the Turnberry resort in Scotland, where there is a Colin Montgomerie Golf Academy.

==Personal life==
Montgomerie met his first wife Eimear Wilson, from Troon, when he was a good amateur and she was a promotions assistant. She was a 17-year-old law student at Edinburgh University and a spectator at an amateur championship in Nairn, at which Montgomerie destroyed the field. The couple had three children, and lived in Oxshott, Surrey. In 2002, Eimear gave Montgomerie an ultimatum to choose between golf and marriage, resulting in Montgomerie spending 10 weeks alone before they agreed to try again.

In 2006, the couple finally broke up, with Eimear suing for divorce on grounds of &quot;unreasonable behaviour due to his obsession with golf&quot;, claiming it left her suffering from anxiety and depression. In 2006, the couple agreed to a clean break divorce settlement of £8 million, in return for Eimear giving up any claim on Colin&#x27;s future earnings.

Since the divorce, he has had various relationships, including Spanish model Inés Sastre, and a divorced neighbour Jo Baldwin, whom he met on the school run. Their split, he suggested, caused his worst run in his professional career.

In 2007, Montgomerie announced his engagement to Scottish millionairess Gaynor Knowles. The couple wed on 19 April 2008 at Loch Lomond Golf Club. On 8 July 2010, Montgomerie was granted a super injunction by Mr Justice Eady, which came to light when he attended a press conference at the 2010 PGA Championship in Wisconsin. In March 2017, he and Knowles divorced. Montgomerie married for the third time in 2023 to his manager, Sarah Casey.

<text>Jacksonville State University is a public university in Jacksonville, Alabama. Founded in 1883, Jacksonville State offers programs of study in six academic schools leading to bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, education specialist, and doctorate degrees in addition to certificate programs and continuing education opportunities.

The university was founded as Jacksonville State Normal School, and in 1930, the name changed to Jacksonville State Teachers College, and again in 1957, to Jacksonville State College. The university began operating under its current name in 1966.

JSU currently has an enrollment of more than 9,000 students, with nearly 500 faculty members (more than 300 of whom are full-time). It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

==History==

=== Jacksonville State Normal School ===
The university was founded as Jacksonville State Normal School, a &quot;class A&quot; normal school, it was chartered by the state of Alabama and Gov. Edward A. O&#x27;Neal on February 22, 1883, in order to prepare teachers for work in public school. It was established within campus of the former Calhoun College in Jacksonville. The first board of directors for the normal school included S. K. McSpadden, John M. Caldwell, James Crook, W. P. Howell, William M. Hames, D. A. Alderholt, H.L. Stevenson, W. J. Alexander, J. Y. Nisbet, L. W. Grant, and John D. Hammond, who served as the state superintendent of education.

The board of directors nominated James G. Ryals Jr. as the school&#x27;s first president when it opened in the fall of 1883, and when Ryals died unexpectedly of pneumonia in 1885, faculty member Joseph Harris Chappell held the presidency for a year. Chappell departed for Milledgeville, Georgia where he served as the first president of a new normal school that eventually became Georgia College &amp; State University. The first graduating class of Jacksonville State Normal School was in 1886. It was one of the first educational institutions in Alabama to have a library on campus.

=== Name changes ===
In 1930, the name changed to Jacksonville State Teachers College. In 1957, the school name changed once again, to Jacksonville State College after the creation of the first graduate program, a master&#x27;s degree in elementary education. In August 1966, the Alabama State Board of Education elevated the college to university status, which prompted a school name change to Jacksonville State University.

=== 2018 tornado ===
On the evening of March 19, 2018, an EF3 tornado struck the campus, causing minor to severe damage to every building. It was the first day of spring break for both the university and the Jacksonville City School System.

Classes resumed at the university on April 9, 2018, and the spring commencement ceremony was held on May 4, 2018, as scheduled, but moved to JSU Stadium from Pete Mathews Coliseum (which was also closed due to tornado damage). There were four injuries among city residents and no fatalities. More than $100 million in property damage was inflicted on the university and on April 27, 2018, President Donald Trump declared the event a federal disaster. The university continued its summer semester as planned, and President John Beehler stated all subsequent semesters will continue as normal.

== Presidents ==
== Administration and organization ==

Since 2019, Jacksonville State is administered by President Don Killlingsworth, and the Jacksonville State Board of Trustees. Members of the board are appointed by the Governor of Alabama to set the policies of the university and select senior management personnel. Under the doctrine of collective responsibility, the entire board is liable for the financial and other consequences of the organization&#x27;s activities. The President oversees his or her Presidential Cabinet, composed of the university&#x27;s vice presidents and other senior personnel.

===Academic organization===

Through Jacksonville State&#x27;s six academic colleges, the university offers career-centered programs where students can prepare for the workforce.
* College of Arts, Humanities and Sciences
* College of Business and Industry
* College of Education and Professional Studies
* College of Health Professions and Wellness

With this campus being the flagship campus for Jacksonville State, it offers large educational facilities, university housing and residence, on-campus dining, student centers, Greek housing, athletic facilities, student health and wellness facilities, administration offices, study centers, an international housing program, and an on-campus bookstore. The majority of students who study at Jacksonville State attend courses here.

===Little River Canyon Center campus===
The Little River Canyon Center campus opened to the public in 2009, and is a Jacksonville State University building located in Fort Payne, Alabama that adjoins the Little River Canyon National Preserve. A portion is leased to the National Park Service and the staff of the Little River Canyon National Preserve with a facility that features a Grand Hall, HD movie theater, gift shop, natural history library, exhibits, classrooms, back deck, outdoor amphitheater and trails for both education and adventure.

Since 2005, the McClellan Center Building 3181 has been home to the Institute of Emergency Preparedness, In-Service, and the Northeast Alabama Police Academy. GSCC houses the traditional college students. Their EMS and 911 programs, in addition to the core classes of English, math, etc., are also housed in the building.

== Enrollment ==

==Campus events==

On January 1, 2012, the university&#x27;s marching band and dance team, The Southerners and the Marching Ballerinas, led the New Year&#x27;s Day Parade in London, England, which also kicked off the year-long celebration of both Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee and the 2012 London Summer Olympics. The invitation to lead the parade came in September 2010, just as the Southerners learned that they had been awarded the nationally recognized George Washington Honor Medal for their patriotic 2009 show, &quot;Of Thee I Sing.&quot;

In February 2006, Jacksonville State University was named the &quot;winner&quot; of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) Speech Code of the Month. At the time, FIRE called the University Code of Conduct &quot;illegally overbroad.&quot; They considered the code to be in violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution which protects offensive speech. The policy has since been changed.

==Athletics==

Jacksonville State&#x27;s athletics teams are nicknamed the Gamecocks. The school fields varsity teams in 14 sports: baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, cross country, football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, rifle, women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, women&#x27;s track and field, and volleyball. The football team plays in 25,000-seat Burgess-Snow Field. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball and volleyball teams play in Pete Mathews Coliseum. 

Prior to the 1993–94 academic year, Jacksonville State competed in NCAA Division II athletics, winning national championships in men&#x27;s basketball (1985), baseball (1990 and 1991), football (1992) and gymnastics (1984 and 1985).

On July 1, 2021, Jax State moved to the Division I ASUN Conference, of which it had been a member from 1995 to 2003. The ASUN did not sponsor football, although it announced plans to launch a football league in the near future. Until that time, Jax State was a de facto associate member of the Western Athletic Conference, competing in a football partnership between the two conferences officially branded as the ASUN–WAC Challenge. 

The school&#x27;s football team garnered attention in 2001 when junior (3rd-year) placekicker Ashley Martin became the first female football player to score a point in a Division I game, kicking for 3 points against Cumberland University.

Since 2023, Jax State has been a football member of Conference USA in Division I FBS (Football Bowl Subdivision).

The Gamecocks hire former Division I football coach Rich &quot;RichRod&quot; Rodriguez for the 2022 season. Rodriguez was previously head coach at football power Michigan (2008–10), as well as West Virginia (2001–07) and Arizona (2012–17). His luster has dulled in recent years, and he seeks his return to the head coaching circle here at Jax State. He comes from Louisiana Monroe, where he served as the offensive coordinator under head coach Terry Bowden. &quot;RichRod&quot; replaces former Gamecocks head coach John Grass, who resigned after the 2021 season. Grass had a 72–26 record during his tenure as head coach which included 6 Ohio Valley Conference championships. In 2021, the Gamecocks upset the Florida State Seminoles in Tallahassee, Florida on a 59-yard touchdown pass at the end of the game.

David L. Walters, for whom JSU&#x27;s music department is named, served as band director from 1961 to 1991 and is credited with bringing the Marching Southerners to national prominence. The Marching Southerners feature the Marching Ballerinas and the famous 20J&#x27;s, named for the C.G. Conn 20J tuba that the Southerners proudly feature in its halftime shows. The Southerners were the 2021 recipients of the Sudler Trophy, the highest award for collegiate marching bands.

==Greek life==
Over ten percent of the undergraduate student body is said to be involved in Greek life. There are approximately 17 social and 22 other Greek-letter organizations.

A total of 16 students were arrested in 2013 in connection with allegations of hazing; news reports stated that Alpha Phi Alpha had been involved. In 2015, JSU&#x27;s chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon was closed down following another set of hazing allegations.

<text>Gherasim Luca (; 23 July 1913 – 9 February 1994) was a Romanian surrealist theorist and poet. Born Salman Locker in Romania and also known as Costea Sar, and Petre Malcoci, he became an apatrid after leaving Romania in 1952.
== Biography ==

Born in Bucharest the son of Jewish tailor Berl Locker (died 1914), he spoke Yiddish, Romanian, German, and French. During 1938, he traveled frequently to Paris where he was introduced to surrealists. World War II and the official antisemitism in Romania forced him into local exile. During the pre-Communist period of Romanian independence, he founded a surrealist artists group with Gellu Naum, Paul Păun, Virgil Teodorescu and Dolfi Trost.

His first publications, including poems in French followed. He was the inventor of cubomania and, in 1945 with Dolfi Trost, authored &quot;Dialectic of Dialectic&quot;, a manifesto of the surrealist movement Surautomatism. Harassed in Romania and caught while trying to flee the country, he left Romania in 1952, and moved to Paris through Israel.

There he worked among others with Jean Arp, Paul Celan, François Di Dio and Max Ernst, producing numerous collages, drawings, objects, and text-installations. From 1967, his reading sessions took him to Stockholm, Oslo, Geneva, New York City, and San Francisco. The 1988 TV-portrait by Raoul Sanglas, &quot;Comment s&#x27;en sortir sans sortir&quot;, made him famous for a larger readership.

At the end of the 1980s, Luca&#x27;s residence building in Montmartre was deemed insalubrious by the French authorities. In order to be relocated to another building, he had to justify his citizenship. As he had been without one ever since leaving Romania, he acquired French citizenship by marrying his long time partner. 

On 9 February 1994, at the age of 80, he committed suicide by jumping into the Seine.

== Selected works ==

Luca initially wrote most of his poetic works in his native Romanian. Two collections of these, &quot;Inventatorul Iubirii&quot; and &quot;Un lup văzut printr-o lupă,&quot; published in Bucharest in 1945, were translated into English (&quot;The Inventor of Love and Other Works&quot;) by Julian and Laura Semilian and published by Black Widow Press in 2009.

With the authorisation of éditions Corti, a forthcoming chapbook of his poems translated by Fiona Sze-Lorrain will be featured in &quot;Poetry International&quot;, Issue no. 15, Spring 2010.

<doc id="379619" wikidata="Q7619060" url="?curid=379619" title="Stone duality">
<text>In mathematics, there is an ample supply of categorical dualities between certain categories of topological spaces and categories of partially ordered sets. Today, these dualities are usually collected under the label Stone duality, since they form a natural generalization of Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras. These concepts are named in honor of Marshall Stone. Stone-type dualities also provide the foundation for pointless topology and are exploited in theoretical computer science for the study of formal semantics.

This article gives pointers to special cases of Stone duality and explains a very general instance thereof in detail.

==Overview of Stone-type dualities==
Probably the most general duality that is classically referred to as &quot;Stone duality&quot; is the duality between the category Sob of sober spaces with continuous functions and the category SFrm of spatial frames with appropriate frame homomorphisms. The dual category of SFrm is the category of spatial locales denoted by SLoc. The categorical equivalence of Sob and SLoc is the basis for the mathematical area of pointless topology, which is devoted to the study of Loc—the category of all locales, of which SLoc is a full subcategory. The involved constructions are characteristic for this kind of duality, and are detailed below.

Now one can easily obtain a number of other dualities by restricting to certain special classes of sober spaces:
* The category CohSp of coherent spaces (and coherent maps) is equivalent to the category CohLoc of coherent (or spectral) locales (and coherent maps), on the assumption of the Boolean prime ideal theorem (in fact, this statement is equivalent to that assumption). The significance of this result stems from the fact that CohLoc in turn is dual to the category DLat01 of bounded distributive lattices. Hence, DLat01 is dual to CohSp—one obtains Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for distributive lattices.
* When restricting further to coherent spaces that are Hausdorff, one obtains the category Stone of so-called Stone spaces. On the side of DLat01, the restriction yields the subcategory Bool of Boolean algebras. Thus one obtains Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras.
* Stone&#x27;s representation for distributive lattices can be extended via an equivalence of coherent spaces and Priestley spaces (ordered topological spaces, that are compact and totally order-disconnected). One obtains a representation of distributive lattices via ordered topologies: Priestley&#x27;s representation theorem for distributive lattices.

Many other Stone-type dualities could be added to these basic dualities.

== Duality of sober spaces and spatial locales ==

=== The lattice of open sets ===
The starting point for the theory is the fact that every topological space is characterized by a set of points &quot;X&quot; and a system Ω(&quot;X&quot;) of open sets of elements from &quot;X&quot;, i.e. a subset of the powerset of &quot;X&quot;. It is known that Ω(&quot;X&quot;) has certain special properties: it is a complete lattice within which suprema and finite infima are given by set unions and finite set intersections, respectively. Furthermore, it contains both &quot;X&quot; and the empty set. Since the embedding of Ω(&quot;X&quot;) into the powerset lattice of &quot;X&quot; preserves finite infima and arbitrary suprema, Ω(&quot;X&quot;) inherits the following distributivity law:

:formula_1

for every element (open set) &quot;x&quot; and every subset &quot;S&quot; of Ω(&quot;X&quot;). Hence Ω(&quot;X&quot;) is not an arbitrary complete lattice but a &quot;complete Heyting algebra&quot; (also called &quot;frame&quot; or &quot;locale&quot; – the various names are primarily used to distinguish several categories that have the same class of objects but different morphisms: frame morphisms, locale morphisms and homomorphisms of complete Heyting algebras). Now an obvious question is: To what extent is a topological space characterized by its locale of open sets?

As already hinted at above, one can go even further. The category Top of topological spaces has as morphisms the continuous functions, where a function &quot;f&quot; is continuous if the inverse image &quot;f&quot; −1(&quot;O&quot;) of any open set in the codomain of &quot;f&quot; is open in the domain of &quot;f&quot;. Thus any continuous function &quot;f&quot; from a space &quot;X&quot; to a space &quot;Y&quot; defines an inverse mapping &quot;f&quot; −1 from Ω(&quot;Y&quot;) to Ω(&quot;X&quot;). Furthermore, it is easy to check that &quot;f&quot; −1 (like any inverse image map) preserves finite intersections and arbitrary unions and therefore is a &quot;morphism of frames&quot;. If we define Ω(&quot;f&quot;) = &quot;f&quot; −1 then Ω becomes a contravariant functor from the category Top to the category Frm of frames and frame morphisms. Using the tools of category theory, the task of finding a characterization of topological spaces in terms of their open set lattices is equivalent to finding a functor from Frm to Top which is adjoint to Ω.

=== Points of a locale ===
The goal of this section is to define a functor pt from Frm to Top that in a certain sense &quot;inverts&quot; the operation of Ω by assigning to each locale &quot;L&quot; a set of points pt(&quot;L&quot;) (hence the notation pt) with a suitable topology. But how can we recover the set of points just from the locale, though it is not given as a lattice of sets? It is certain that one cannot expect in general that pt can reproduce all of the original elements of a topological space just from its lattice of open sets – for example all sets with the indiscrete topology yield (up to isomorphism) the same locale, such that the information on the specific set is no longer present. However, there is still a reasonable technique for obtaining &quot;points&quot; from a locale, which indeed gives an example of a central construction for Stone-type duality theorems.

Let us first look at the points of a topological space &quot;X&quot;. One is usually tempted to consider a point of &quot;X&quot; as an element &quot;x&quot; of the set &quot;X&quot;, but there is in fact a more useful description for our current investigation. Any point &quot;x&quot; gives rise to a continuous function &quot;p&quot;&quot;x&quot; from the one element topological space 1 (all subsets of which are open) to the space &quot;X&quot; by defining &quot;p&quot;&quot;x&quot;(1) = &quot;x&quot;. Conversely, any function from 1 to &quot;X&quot; clearly determines one point: the element that it &quot;points&quot; to. Therefore, the set of points of a topological space is equivalently characterized as the set of functions from 1 to &quot;X&quot;.

When using the functor Ω to pass from Top to Frm, all set-theoretic elements of a space are lost, but – using a fundamental idea of category theory – one can as well work on the function spaces. Indeed, any &quot;point&quot; &quot;p&quot;&quot;x&quot;: 1 → &quot;X&quot; in Top is mapped to a morphism Ω(&quot;p&quot;&quot;x&quot;): Ω(&quot;X&quot;) → Ω(1). The open set lattice of the one-element topological space Ω(1) is just (isomorphic to) the two-element locale 2 = { 0, 1 } with 0 &lt; 1. After these observations it appears reasonable to define the set of points of a locale &quot;L&quot; to be the set of frame morphisms from &quot;L&quot; to 2. Yet, there is no guarantee that every point of the locale Ω(&quot;X&quot;) is in one-to-one correspondence to a point of the topological space &quot;X&quot; (consider again the indiscrete topology, for which the open set lattice has only one &quot;point&quot;).

Before defining the required topology on pt(&quot;X&quot;), it is worthwhile to clarify the concept of a point of a locale further. The perspective motivated above suggests to consider a point of a locale &quot;L&quot; as a frame morphism &quot;p&quot; from &quot;L&quot; to 2. But these morphisms are characterized equivalently by the inverse images of the two elements of 2. From the properties of frame morphisms, one can derive that &quot;p&quot; −1(0) is a lower set (since &quot;p&quot; is monotone), which contains a greatest element &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; = V &quot;p&quot; −1(0) (since &quot;p&quot; preserves arbitrary suprema). In addition, the principal ideal &quot;p&quot; −1(0) is a prime ideal since &quot;p&quot; preserves finite infima and thus the principal &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; is a meet-prime element. Now the set-inverse of &quot;p&quot; −1(0) given by &quot;p&quot; −1(1) is a completely prime filter because &quot;p&quot; −1(0) is a principal prime ideal. It turns out that all of these descriptions uniquely determine the initial frame morphism. We sum up:

:A point of a locale &quot;L&quot; is equivalently described as:
:* a frame morphism from &quot;L&quot; to 2
:* a principal prime ideal of &quot;L&quot;
:* a meet-prime element of &quot;L&quot;
:* a completely prime filter of &quot;L&quot;.

All of these descriptions have their place within the theory and it is convenient to switch between them as needed.

=== The functor pt ===
Now that a set of points is available for any locale, it remains to equip this set with an appropriate topology in order to define the object part of the functor pt. This is done by defining the open sets of pt(&quot;L&quot;) as

:φ(&quot;a&quot;) = { &quot;p&quot; ∈ pt(&quot;L&quot;) | &quot;p&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 },

for every element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;L&quot;. Here we viewed the points of &quot;L&quot; as morphisms, but one can of course state a similar definition for all of the other equivalent characterizations. It can be shown that setting Ω(pt(&quot;L&quot;)) = {φ(&quot;a&quot;) | &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;} does really yield a topological space (pt(&quot;L&quot;), Ω(pt(&quot;L&quot;))). It is common to abbreviate this space as pt(&quot;L&quot;).

Finally pt can be defined on morphisms of Frm rather canonically by defining, for a frame morphism &quot;g&quot; from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;M&quot;, pt(&quot;g&quot;): pt(&quot;M&quot;) → pt(&quot;L&quot;) as pt(&quot;g&quot;)(&quot;p&quot;) = &quot;p&quot; o &quot;g&quot;. In words, we obtain a morphism from &quot;L&quot; to 2 (a point of &quot;L&quot;) by applying the morphism &quot;g&quot; to get from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;M&quot; before applying the morphism &quot;p&quot; that maps from &quot;M&quot; to 2. Again, this can be formalized using the other descriptions of points of a locale as well – for example just calculate (&quot;p&quot; o &quot;g&quot;) −1(0).

===The adjunction of Top and Loc===
As noted several times before, pt and Ω usually are not inverses. In general neither is &quot;X&quot; homeomorphic to pt(Ω(&quot;X&quot;)) nor is &quot;L&quot; order-isomorphic to Ω(pt(&quot;L&quot;)). However, when introducing the topology of pt(&quot;L&quot;) above, a mapping φ from &quot;L&quot; to Ω(pt(&quot;L&quot;)) was applied. This mapping is indeed a frame morphism. Conversely, we can define a continuous function ψ from &quot;X&quot; to pt(Ω(&quot;X&quot;)) by setting ψ(&quot;x&quot;) = Ω(&quot;p&quot;&quot;x&quot;), where &quot;p&quot;&quot;x&quot; is just the characteristic function for the point &quot;x&quot; from 1 to &quot;X&quot; as described above. Another convenient description is given by viewing points of a locale as meet-prime elements. In this case we have ψ(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;X&quot; \ Cl{&quot;x&quot;}, where Cl{&quot;x&quot;} denotes the topological closure of the set {&quot;x&quot;} and \ is just set-difference.

At this point we already have more than enough data to obtain the desired result: the functors Ω and pt define an adjunction between the categories Top and Loc = Frmop, where pt is right adjoint to Ω and the natural transformations ψ and φop provide the required unit and counit, respectively.

=== The duality theorem ===
The above adjunction is not an equivalence of the categories Top and Loc (or, equivalently, a duality of Top and Frm). For this it is necessary that both ψ and φ are isomorphisms in their respective categories.

For a space &quot;X&quot;, ψ: &quot;X&quot; → pt(Ω(&quot;X&quot;)) is a homeomorphism if and only if it is bijective. Using the characterization via meet-prime elements of the open set lattice, one sees that this is the case if and only if every meet-prime open set is of the form &quot;X&quot; \ Cl{&quot;x&quot;} for a unique &quot;x&quot;. Alternatively, every join-prime closed set is the closure of a unique point, where &quot;join-prime&quot; can be replaced by (join-) irreducible since we are in a distributive lattice. Spaces with this property are called sober.

Conversely, for a locale &quot;L&quot;, φ: &quot;L&quot; → Ω(pt(&quot;L&quot;)) is always surjective. It is additionally injective if and only if any two elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of &quot;L&quot; for which &quot;a&quot; is not less-or-equal to &quot;b&quot; can be separated by points of the locale, formally:

: if not &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;, then there is a point &quot;p&quot; in pt(&quot;L&quot;) such that p(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 and p(&quot;b&quot;) = 0.

If this condition is satisfied for all elements of the locale, then the locale is spatial, or said to have enough points. (See also well-pointed category for a similar condition in more general categories.)

Finally, one can verify that for every space &quot;X&quot;, Ω(&quot;X&quot;) is spatial and for every locale &quot;L&quot;, pt(&quot;L&quot;) is sober. Hence, it follows that the above adjunction of Top and Loc restricts to an equivalence of the full subcategories Sob of sober spaces and SLoc of spatial locales. This main result is completed by the observation that for the functor pt o Ω, sending each space to the points of its open set lattice is left adjoint to the inclusion functor from Sob to Top. For a space &quot;X&quot;, pt(Ω(&quot;X&quot;)) is called its soberification. The case of the functor Ω o pt is symmetric but a special name for this operation is not commonly used.

<text>Richard Stoddert Ewell (February 8, 1817 – January 25, 1872) was an American military officer and a Confederate general during the American Civil War. He achieved fame as a senior commander under Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee and fought effectively through much of the war. Still, his legacy was clouded by controversies over his actions at the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House.

==Early life and career==
Ewell was born in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. He was raised in Prince William County, Virginia, from the age of 3, at an estate near Manassas known as &quot;Stony Lonesome.&quot; He was the third son of Dr. Thomas and Elizabeth Stoddert Ewell; the grandson of Benjamin Stoddert, the first United States Secretary of the Navy; the grandson of Revolutionary War Colonel Jesse Ewell; and the brother of Benjamin Stoddert Ewell. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1840, thirteenth in his class of 43 cadets. His friends called him &quot;Old Bald Head&quot; or &quot;Baldy.&quot; He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Dragoons and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1845. From 1843 to 1845, he served with Philip St. George Cooke and Stephen Watts Kearny on escort duty along the Santa Fe and Oregon Trails. In the Mexican–American War, serving under Winfield Scott, he was recognized and promoted to captain for his courage at the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco. At Contreras, he conducted a nighttime reconnaissance with engineer Captain Robert E. Lee, his future commander.

Ewell served in the New Mexico Territory for some time, exploring the newly acquired Gadsden Purchase with Colonel Benjamin Bonneville. He was wounded in a skirmish with Apaches under Cochise in 1859. In 1860, while in command of Fort Buchanan, Arizona, illness compelled him to leave the West for Virginia to recuperate. He described his condition as &quot;very ill with vertigo, nausea, etc., and now am excessively debilitated[,] having occasional attacks of the ague.&quot; Illnesses and injuries would cause difficulties for him throughout the upcoming Civil War.

==Civil War==
As the nation moved towards war, Ewell had generally pro-Union sentiments. Nevertheless, when his home state of Virginia declared secession, Ewell resigned from the U.S. Army on May 7, 1861, to join the Provisional Army of Virginia. He was appointed a colonel of cavalry on May 9 and was the first officer of field grade wounded in the war at a May 31 skirmish at Fairfax Court House where he was hit in the shoulder. He was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate States Army on June 17. He commanded a brigade in the (Confederate) Army of the Potomac at the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas). Still, his brigade was guarding fords downstream and did not get into the action at all.

Hours after the battle, Ewell proposed to President of the Confederate States of America Jefferson Davis that for the Confederacy to win the war, enslaved people must be freed and join the ranks of the army; he was also willing to lead black soldiers into battle. But Davis considered that &quot;impossible&quot;, and that topic never came up between him and Ewell again. Nevertheless, like Patrick Cleburne, Ewell was one of those few Confederate generals who believed the Confederacy needed all the soldiers it could get, regardless of race.

In late July, Ewell was furious when he heard that his commanding officer, P. G. T. Beauregard, blamed him for not following orders at Bull Run (Manassas) when the orders did not reach him in time.

Ewell inspired his men despite, not because of, his appearance. Historian Larry Tagg using General Richard Taylor&#x27;s description, described him:

===With Stonewall Jackson===

Ewell was promoted to major general and division command on January 24, 1862. When Joe Johnston&#x27;s army pulled out of the Manassas area in March and went down to Richmond, Ewell&#x27;s division was stationed around Culpeper. In May, he was ordered to the Shenandoah Valley to reinforce &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. Ewell moved west, crossing the Blue Ridge, and managed to locate Jackson&#x27;s command after some difficulty. Although the two generals worked together well and were noted for their quixotic personal behavior, they had many stylistic differences. Jackson was stern and pious, whereas Ewell was witty and extremely profane. Jackson was flexible and intuitive on the battlefield, while Ewell, although brave and effective, required precise instructions to function effectively. Ewell was initially resentful about Jackson&#x27;s tendency to keep his subordinates uninformed about his tactical plans, but he eventually adjusted to Jackson&#x27;s methods.

Ewell superbly commanded a division in Jackson&#x27;s small army during the Valley Campaign, personally winning quite a few battles against the larger U.S. armies of Maj. Gens. Nathaniel P. Banks, John C. Frémont, and James Shields at the Battle of Front Royal and First Battle of Winchester, Battle of Cross Keys, and Battle of Port Republic, respectively. Jackson&#x27;s army was then recalled to Richmond to join Robert E. Lee in protecting the city against Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac in the Peninsula Campaign. Ewell fought conspicuously at Gaines&#x27; Mill and saw relatively light action at Malvern Hill. After Lee repelled the U.S. army in the Seven Days Battles, U.S. Maj. Gen. John Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia threatened to attack from the north, so Jackson was sent to intercept him. Ewell defeated Banks again at the Battle of Cedar Mountain on August 9, and, returning to the old Manassas battlefield, he led his division into action at Brawner&#x27;s Farm on August 28. A Minie ball shattered Ewell&#x27;s left leg, and he lay on the ground for several hours before being found and taken away. Ewell&#x27;s leg was amputated, and was administered chloroform as an anesthetic. Ewell faced a painful recovery lasting months. Although he received a wooden leg, the irregular shape of the leg stump made it difficult to fit it. Ewell slipped and fell in Richmond on Christmas Day, aggravating his injury further.

While recovering from his injury, Ewell was nursed by his first cousin, Lizinka Campbell Brown, a wealthy widow from the Nashville area. Ewell had been attracted to Lizinka since his teenage years, and they had flirted with romance in 1861 and during the Valley Campaign, but now the close contact resulted in their wedding in Richmond on May 26, 1863.

Ewell returned to Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia after the Battle of Chancellorsville. After the mortal wounding of Jackson at that battle, on May 23, Ewell was promoted to lieutenant general and command of the Second Corps (now slightly smaller than Jackson&#x27;s because units were detached to create a new Third Corps, under Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill, also one of Jackson&#x27;s division commanders). Ewell was given a date of rank one day earlier than Hill&#x27;s, so he became the third-highest-ranking general in the Army of Northern Virginia, after Lee and James Longstreet.

===Gettysburg and controversy===
Ewell continued to have difficulty walking and needed crutches when not mounted on horseback. In the opening days of the Gettysburg Campaign, at the Second Battle of Winchester, Ewell performed superbly, capturing the U.S. garrison of 4,000 men and 23 cannons. He escaped severe injury there when he was hit in the chest with a spent bullet (the second such incident in his career, after Gaines&#x27; Mill). His corps took the lead in the invasion of Pennsylvania and almost reached the state capital of Harrisburg before being recalled by Lee to concentrate at Gettysburg. These successes led to favorable comparisons with Jackson.

But at the Battle of Gettysburg, Ewell&#x27;s military reputation started a long decline. On July 1, 1863, Ewell&#x27;s corps approached Gettysburg from the north and smashed the U.S. XI Corps and part of the I Corps, driving them back through the town and forcing them to take up defensive positions on Cemetery Hill south of town. Lee had just arrived on the field and saw the importance of this position. He sent discretionary orders to Ewell that Cemetery Hill be taken &quot;if practicable.&quot; Historian James M. McPherson wrote, &quot;Had Jackson still lived, he undoubtedly would have found it practicable. But Ewell was not Jackson.&quot; Ewell chose not to attempt the assault.

Ewell had several possible reasons for not attacking. The orders from Lee contained an innate contradiction. He was &quot;to carry the hill occupied by the enemy, if he found it practicable, but to avoid a general engagement until the arrival of the other divisions of the army.&quot; Lee also refused to provide assistance that Ewell requested from the corps of A. P. Hill. Ewell&#x27;s men were fatigued from their lengthy marching and strenuous battle in the hot July afternoon. It would be difficult to reassemble them into battle formation and assault the hill through the narrow corridors afforded by the streets of Gettysburg. The fresh division under Maj. Gen. Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson was arriving. Still, Ewell also received intelligence that heavy U.S. reinforcements were approaching from the east on the York Pike, potentially threatening his flank. Ewell&#x27;s normally aggressive subordinate, Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early, concurred with his decision.

Lee&#x27;s order has been criticized because it left too much discretion to Ewell. Historians such as McPherson have speculated on how the more aggressive Stonewall Jackson would have acted on this order if he had lived to command this wing of Lee&#x27;s army and how differently the second day of battle would have proceeded with Confederate possession of Culp&#x27;s Hill or Cemetery Hill. Discretionary orders were customary for General Lee because Jackson and James Longstreet, his other principal subordinate, usually reacted to them very well and could use their initiative to respond to conditions and achieve the desired results. Ewell&#x27;s critics have noted that this failure of action on his part, whether justified or not, ultimately cost the Confederates the battle. Other historians have noted that Lee, as the overall commanding general who issued discretionary orders to Ewell and then continued the battle for another two days, bears the final responsibility for the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg.

When Ewell&#x27;s corps attacked these positions on July 2 and 3, the U.S. army had had time to fully occupy the heights and build impregnable defenses, resulting in heavy Confederate losses. Postwar proponents of the Lost Cause movement, particularly Jubal Early, but also Maj. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble, assigned to Ewell&#x27;s staff during the battle, criticized him bitterly to deflect any blame for losing the battle on Robert E. Lee. Part of their argument was that the U.S. soldiers were demoralized by their defeat earlier in the day. Still, Ewell&#x27;s men were also disorganized, and their decisions were far simpler to make in hindsight than in the heat of battle and fog of war.

On July 3, Ewell was again wounded, but only in his wooden leg. He led his corps on an orderly retreat back to Virginia. By late November, Ewell took a leave of absence due to fever and continued problems with his leg. Within a month, he returned to command but struggled with his health and mobility. He was bruised in a fall from his horse in January 1864.

===Overland Campaign and Richmond===

Ewell led his corps in the May 1864 Battle of the Wilderness and performed well, enjoying a slight numerical superiority over the U.S. corps that attacked him. In the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Lee felt compelled to lead the defense of the &quot;Mule Shoe&quot; on May 12 personally because of Ewell&#x27;s indecision and inaction. At one point, Ewell began hysterically berating some of his fleeing soldiers and beating them over the back with his sword. Lee reined him in, saying sharply, &quot;General Ewell, you must restrain yourself; how can you expect to control these men when you have lost control of yourself? If you cannot repress your excitement, you had better retire.&quot; Ewell&#x27;s behavior on this occasion undoubtedly was the source of a statement made by Lee to his secretary, William Allan, after the war that on May 12, he &quot;found Ewell perfectly prostrated by the misfortune of the morning, and too much overwhelmed to be efficient.&quot; In the final combat at Spotsylvania, on May 19, 1864, Ewell ordered an attack on the U.S. left flank at the Harris Farm, which had little effect beyond delaying Grant for a day, at the cost of 900 casualties, about one-sixth of his remaining force.

Lee felt that Ewell was not in any shape for field command and decided to reassign him to the Richmond defenses. In April 1865, as Ewell and his troops were retreating, many fires in Richmond were started, although it is unclear by whose orders the fires were started. Ewell blamed the plundering mobs of civilians for burning a tobacco warehouse, which was a significant source of the fire, but Nelson Lankford, the author of &quot;Richmond Burning&quot;, wrote that &quot;Ewell convinced few people that the great fire had nothing to do with his men or their deliberate demolition of the warehouses and bridges through military orders passed down the chain of command.&quot; These fires created The Great Conflagration of Richmond, which left a third of the city destroyed, including all of the business district. Ewell and his troops were then surrounded and captured at Sailor&#x27;s Creek. This was a few days before Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Court House. Ewell told his captors that he had no idea what Lee was planning to do next, but the Confederacy was clearly doomed, and he hoped he would have the sense to surrender. He was held as a prisoner of war at Fort Warren in Boston Harbor until July.

While imprisoned, Ewell organized a group of sixteen former generals also at Fort Warren, including Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson and Joseph B. Kershaw, and sent a letter to Ulysses S. Grant about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, for which they said no Southern man could feel anything other than &quot;unqualified abhorrence and indignation&quot; and insisting that the crime should not be connected to the southern states.

==Postbellum life==

After his parole, Ewell retired to work as a &quot;gentleman farmer&quot; on his wife&#x27;s farm near Spring Hill, Tennessee, which he helped to become profitable, and also leased a successful cotton plantation in Mississippi. His leg stump had largely healed by the war&#x27;s end and no longer seriously bothered him, but he continued to suffer from neuralgia and other ailments. He doted on Lizinka&#x27;s children and grandchildren. He was president of the Columbia Female Academy&#x27;s board of trustees, a communicant at St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Columbia, and president of the Maury County Agricultural Society. Ewell and his wife came down with pneumonia in January 1872 and died within a few days of each other. They were buried in Old City Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee. He is the author of &quot;The Making of a Soldier&quot;, published posthumously in 1935.

==In popular media==
Tim Scott portrayed Ewell in the 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, based on Michael Shaara&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;. In that movie, Maj. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble meets with Robert E. Lee and tells him that Ewell had refused to take Cemetery Hill, giving the U.S. army a massive advantage, and that many men would die in the coming days because of that failure.

Ewell is the main character in the 1963 gospel film &quot;Red Runs the River&quot; and is portrayed by Bob Jones Jr. The film, directed by Katherine Stenholm, details Ewell&#x27;s relationship with Stonewall Jackson and Ewell&#x27;s conversion to Christ following his wound at the Second Battle of Bull Run (Manassas). It is an Unusual Films production from the Cinema Department of Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina. &quot;Red Runs the River&quot; was the film the University Film Producers Association selected to represent the United States at the International Congress of Motion-Picture and Television Schools in Budapest, Hungary.

<text>Friedrich Heinrich Christoph Breymann ( – 7 October 1777) was a senior officer of Brunswick–Luneburg troops who commanded grenadiers in the Northern Theater of the American War of Independence.

== American War of Independence ==
Under the command of British Army officer General John Burgoyne, Breymann fought in the Battle of Bennington and the Battle of Bemis Heights. On 7 October 1777, Breymann&#x27;s unit was driven behind a redoubt by American troops; he grew frustrated with his own men and began attacking four soldiers with his sabre before Breymann was shot and killed by one of them.

<text>Tragic Kingdom is the third studio album by American rock band No Doubt, released on October 10, 1995, by Trauma Records and Interscope Records. It was the final album to feature original keyboardist Eric Stefani, who left the band in 1994. The album was produced by Matthew Wilder and recorded in 11 studios in the Greater Los Angeles area between March 1993 and October 1995. Between 1995 and 1998, the album spawned seven singles, including &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, which charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay and reached the top five of many international charts.

The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics and became the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 as well as topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, No Doubt earned nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. The album has sold over 16 million copies worldwide, and was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States and Canada, platinum in the United Kingdom, and triple platinum in Australia. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; helped facilitate the ska revival of the 1990s, increasing the visibility and commercial success of other ska bands. The album was ranked number 441 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

No Doubt embarked on a tour to promote the album. It was designed by Project X and lasted two and a half years. An early 1997 performance at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim was filmed and released as &quot;Live in the Tragic Kingdom&quot; on VHS and later DVD.

==Background==
No Doubt released their self-titled debut album in 1992, a year after being signed to Interscope. The album&#x27;s pop-oriented sound contrasted with grunge music, which was popular in the United States when &quot;No Doubt&quot; was released. The album sold 30,000 copies; the program director of KROQ radio station, on which the band aspired to be played, said, &quot;it would take an act of God for this band to get on the radio.&quot; The band began work on the album in 1993, but Interscope rejected most of their material, and paired the band with producer Matthew Wilder. Keyboardist Eric Stefani eventually stopped recording with the band because he disliked having to relinquish creative control. He encouraged other members of the band to write songs, but sometimes felt threatened when they did. Eric became increasingly depressed, and in September 1994, he stopped attending rehearsals, though they were usually held at his house. He soon left the band to pursue an animation career on the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Bassist Tony Kanal then ended his seven-year relationship with Gwen Stefani.

The band decided to produce their next album independently and recorded their second album, &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot;, in a homemade studio. No Doubt&#x27;s first two singles were released for &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot;: &quot;Squeal&quot; and &quot;Doghouse&quot;, under their own record label, Beacon Street Records. Despite limited availability, the album sold 100,000 copies in the year of its release. Their independence attracted Interscope&#x27;s attention and ensured that the label would fund a third album.

==Production==

&quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was recorded in 11 studios in Los Angeles, starting in March 1993 and released in October 1995. During one of these recording sessions, the band was introduced to Paul Palmer, who had previously worked with Bush and was interested in working on No Doubt&#x27;s new album. After mixing the first single with David J. Holman, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, Palmer and Holman went on to do the same to the rest of the record. He wanted to release the album on his own label, Trauma Records, which was already associated with Interscope, and succeeded in getting the contract.

The album is named after the nickname guitarist Tom Dumont&#x27;s seventh-grade teacher had for Disneyland, which is in Anaheim, California, where the band members grew up. The album photography and portraits were taken by photographer fine artist Daniel Arsenault. Gwen is featured in the foreground while the rest of the band members are standing in an orange grove in the background. Gwen pushed for Eric to be included on the album cover—a source of tension for the band—reasoning that although he had left the band, he had still contributed substantially to the album. Eric is seen near the back of the picture, looking away from the camera. The pictures on the cover and in the liner notes were taken on city streets in their native Orange County (namely Anaheim and City of Orange) and in orange groves. The red dress Gwen wears on the cover was loaned to the Hard Rock Cafe and was later displayed at the Fullerton Museum Center in an exhibit titled &quot;The Orange Groove: Orange County&#x27;s Rock n&#x27; Roll History&quot;. The dress, appraised as high as US$5,000, was stolen from the exhibit in January 2005.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; has been described as pop rock, alternative rock, ska punk, new wave, and pop-punk. The album also uses elements of pop, funk, punk, dancehall, disco, third-wave ska, post-grunge, ska, reggae, flamenco, and Tejano, among others. 

Many of the lyrics on &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; were written by lead vocalist Gwen Stefani, and were about her experiences in life. Those from &quot;No Doubt&quot; and &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; were written mainly by Eric Stefani, who left the band after &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was finished. Therefore, the style of music changed from what the band had previously produced. Dumont explained the change in sound in an interview for Backstage Online:

==Singles==
The first single released from &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, which details Gwen Stefani&#x27;s exasperation with female stereotypes and her father&#x27;s concerned reaction to her driving home late from her boyfriend&#x27;s house. It peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number 10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song also charted on the UK Singles Chart, where its original release peaked at number 38 and its reissue at number three. The second single was &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, written about an uninterested woman who is trying to avoid the constant phone calls of a persistent man. It reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 Mainstream chart, and number 16 on the UK Singles Chart, but not until it was released after Don&#x27;t Speak hit number one.

The third single was &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;, a ballad about the breakup of Stefani and Kanal&#x27;s relationship. It peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay, and maintained that position for 16 consecutive weeks, a record at the time, although it was broken in 1998 by the Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; &quot;Iris&quot; with 18 weeks. The song was not eligible to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 because no commercial single was released, which was a requirement at the time. The song also peaked at number two on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, at number six on the Adult Contemporary chart, at number one on the Adult Top 40 chart, and at number nine on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart. The song also appeared on several international charts, reaching number one in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, number two in Austria, Germany and Spain, and number four in Finland and France.

&quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; were released as the album&#x27;s fourth and fifth singles, respectively. &quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot; reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 11 in New Zealand. &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; peaked at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 Mainstream chart, number 21 in Australia, number 42 in New Zealand, and number 55 in Sweden. Composing the song began when Kanal was having a fight with Stefani, then his girlfriend, through the bathroom door of his parents&#x27; house in Yorba Linda, California. Stefani later changed the lyrics to discuss dealing with her breakup with Kanal. &quot;Happy Now?&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s sixth single on September 23, 1997, but failed to chart anywhere. &quot;Hey You!&quot; was released as the seventh and final single from &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;; it peaked at number 51 on the Dutch Single Top 100. Despite being a Dutch-only single, a Sophie Muller-directed music video was filmed to promote the single.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was first released by Trauma and Interscope on October 10, 1995. To promote the album, Trauma launched a street campaign that targeted high school students and the skateboarding community. No Doubt performed on the Warped Tour, which was sponsored by several skateboarding companies, and at several skateboarding festivals. The album remained low on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and did not enter the top 100 until February 1996, when it jumped 27 positions to number 89. Palmer attributed the jump to a Channel One News program that Stefani hosted in January 1996, which was broadcast in 12,000 classrooms, and the band&#x27;s subsequent performance at a Blockbuster store in Fresno, California.

In May 1996, the band worked with HMV, MuchMusic, and the Universal Music Group to put on a global in-store promotion. The band performed and answered questions in MuchMusic&#x27;s studios in Toronto, Ontario. The session was broadcast live to HMV stores worldwide and on a webcast so that fans could watch and ask the band questions through MuchMusic&#x27;s VJs. Sales of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; doubled the week after the event. The event&#x27;s sponsors lobbied &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; to create a category for the largest virtual in-store promotion to recognize the event.

No Doubt embarked on the Tragic Kingdom Tour after the release of the album. It chose Project X, headed by Luc Lafortune and Michael Keeling, to design the stage. No Doubt suggested decorating the stage as a clearing in a forest. Project X created three anthropomorphic trees with glowing oranges. The show included clear and mylar confetti designed to look like rain. Lighting design was difficult because there were only four rehearsals, so the show was arranged to be flexible to allow for what Lafortune referred to as &quot;a very kinetic performance&quot;. The band expected to tour for two months, but the tour ended up lasting two and a half years.

An early 1997 performance at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim was filmed and was released as &quot;Live in the Tragic Kingdom&quot; on VHS on November 11, 1997. It was re-released on November 25, 2003, on DVD as part of the box set &quot;Boom Box&quot;, which also contained &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;, &quot;Everything in Time&quot;, and &quot;The Videos 1992–2003&quot;; and again on June 13, 2006, as a stand-alone DVD, containing bonus material of extra songs, a photo gallery, and an alternative version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was mostly enthused by the album, describing it as &quot;ear candy with good beats, not just bludgeon-by-numbers guitars&quot; and its music as &quot;a spry, white-suburban take on ska and Blondieesque pop&quot;. He nonetheless singled out &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; as &quot;irritating swill&quot; with &quot;high-pitched rippling&quot; from Gwen Stefani. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s David Browne was more critical, attributing the album&#x27;s sales to Stefani&#x27;s &quot;leggy, bleached-blond calling card&quot; and concluding that &quot;sex still sells&quot;. Browne described the music as &quot;a hefty chunk of new-wave party bounce and Chili Peppers-style white-boy funk, with dashes of reggae, squealing hair-metal guitar, disco, ska-band horns&quot; and the band as sounding like &quot;savvy, lounge-bred pros&quot;. Individual songs were singled out and commented on: &quot;Just a Girl&quot; was described as &quot;a chirpy, ska-tinged bopper&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; as &quot;an old-fangled power ballad&quot;, &quot;Sixteen&quot; as a &quot;song of solidarity with misunderstood teenage girls&quot;, and &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; and &quot;End It on This&quot; as &quot;[Stefani] acknowledg[ing] obsessions with losers and tr[ying] to break free.&quot;

Calling the album a marked improvement over &quot;the diffuse, rambling songwriting of [No Doubt&#x27;s] two previous CDs&quot;, Mike Boehm of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that on &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, &quot;The band is bright, hard-hitting and kinetic, as sharp production captures the core, four-man instrumental team and adjunct horn section at their best&quot;. In a favorable review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, critic Chuck Eddy felt that although &quot;[the album] turns pretentious ... No Doubt resurrects the exuberance new-wave guys lost when &#x27;80s indie labels and college radio conned them into settling for slam-pit fits and wallflower wallpaper&quot;. His &quot;Village Voice&quot; colleague Robert Christgau was less impressed, calling Stefani &quot;hebephrenic&quot; and the album &quot;hyped up&quot; and not &quot;as songful as its fun-besotted partisans [claim]&quot;. In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it &quot;pure fun&quot; and described the music as something &quot;between &#x27;90s punk, third-wave ska, and pop sensibility&quot; and a mix of &quot;new wave melodicism, post-grunge rock, and West Coast sunshine&quot;, noting the songs &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; as having &quot;positively ruled the airwaves&quot;. Yahoo! Music reviewer Bill Holdship referred to the album as a &quot;phenomenon&quot; containing &quot;hit after hit&quot;, also highlighting &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; as &quot;a terrific opener&quot;.

At the 1997 Grammy Awards, No Doubt were nominated for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. In 2000, &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was voted number 436 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, while in 2003, it was ranked number 441 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. &quot;NME&quot; included &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; on its 2020 list of &quot;The best new wave albums ever&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
After entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 175 in January 1996, &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; eventually reached number one in December 1996, with 229,000 copies sold, spending nine non-consecutive weeks atop the chart. It was listed second on the 1997 &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 year-end chart, behind the Spice Girls&#x27; &quot;Spice&quot;. On February 5, 1999, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album diamond, and as of July 2012, it had sold 8,167,000 copies in the United States; it sold an additional 1.32 million copies through BMG Music Club. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; topped the Canadian Albums Chart in December 1996, and it was certified diamond by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) in August 1997. In Europe, the album topped the chart in Belgium, Finland, and Norway, while reaching the top five in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and the top 20 in France. By April 2004, the album had sold 16 million copies worldwide.

The commercial success of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; prompted record labels to sign ska bands, and more independent labels released ska records and compilations. Save Ferris&#x27;s guitarist and vocalist Brian Mashburn stated that No Doubt helped allow bands like his receive attention from the mainstream.

<text>&quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; is a song by American rock band No Doubt, featured on their third studio album, &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; (1995). Released as an album track in April 1996 by Interscope Records, the song was initially written as a love song by lead singer Gwen Stefani and her brother, former band member Eric Stefani. However, after several revisions, Gwen reworked the lyrics into a breakup song, reflecting the end of her seven-year relationship with bandmate Tony Kanal.

&quot;Don’t Speak&quot; did reach number one on the Hot 100 Airplay chart for 16 weeks. Outside the United States, it topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, becoming No Doubt&#x27;s most successful international single. &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 40th Grammy Awards.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; was ranked at number 495 on &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born&quot;. The song is a playable track in the 2009 video game &quot;Band Hero&quot;, and is also included as a downloadable song in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;, as well as part of the No Doubt Track Pack for &quot;Guitar Hero III&quot;. The song has been sampled by multiple hip hop artists, including in Rakim&#x27;s song &quot;Dedicated&quot; and Ice Cube&#x27;s &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot;.

==Background and composition==
&quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; is an alternative rock power ballad written by lead singer Gwen Stefani and her brother Eric Stefani, and produced by Matthew Wilder. It was originally a love song, but Stefani rewrote the lyrics almost completely after her breakup with the band&#x27;s bass player Tony Kanal. According to her, &quot;It used to be more upbeat, more of a Seventies rock-type thing. [When] Tony and I broke up... it turned into a sad song.&quot; The opening chords are reminiscent to the opening chords of the 1979 pop hit &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; by the British rock band Supertramp. A live version that exists from April 1994 shows off a bouncy tune that has the same skeleton as the released version, but not the same urgency. The band performed part of the original song on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; on August 10, 2000.

The band&#x27;s lead guitarist Tom Dumont said about the song&#x27;s composition: There&#x27;s a lot of stories about that song, because that one unfolded over a longer period of time. Originally, Gwen&#x27;s brother wrote most of that song, and then after we got at it as a band, Gwen changed the lyrics around to fit her life. Musically, we brought it to another level, but near the end we reworded it. There&#x27;s an earlier version of the song where the verses are totally different, which is a really beautiful version and it&#x27;s awesome but it&#x27;s way more jazzy and really different. That song had a long incubation process.

Sheet music for &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; shows the key of E major. A demo version also appeared on a demo CD, which was presented to Interscope Records prior to the release of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;.

==Critical reception==
British magazine &quot;Music Week&quot; rated the song three out of five, writing that &quot;this Californian quartet sound more like Swedish Eurovision hopefuls on this debut UK offering but, if radio bites, it could be a smash.&quot;

==Chart performance==
Upon release, &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; immediately began to receive extensive airplay and it eventually became the most widely played song on American radio in 1996. It reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 Airplay chart and maintained that position for 16 non-consecutive weeks, a record at the time. Despite its copious airplay, &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; was not allowed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 since no commercial single was released for it in the United States (a requirement for charting purposes at the time). &quot;Slate&quot; magazine music critic Chris Molanphy has stated that if the song had been eligible to chart, it almost certainly would have claimed the number one spot. An import CD did sell in the US, but this format was not allowed to chart either.

On other &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; stayed at number two on Modern Rock Tracks chart for five consecutive weeks. The song also proved to be a crossover hit, reaching number one on the Adult Top 40 chart for 15 consecutive weeks as well as numbers six and nine on the Adult Contemporary and Rhythmic Top 40 charts, respectively. It was ultimately placed at number one on the Hot 100 Airplay year-end chart of 1997.
Internationally, &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; was also very successful. In February 1997, it peaked at number one in both the United Kingdom and Ireland for three weeks. Elsewhere in Europe, &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; reached the top position in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Australia was another major music market where the song received widespread airplay, debuting at number one and maintaining the peak position for eight weeks.

==Music video==
The video was directed by Sophie Muller and it is the first of the long-time collaboration between the band and the director. Before the music starts, at the beginning of the music video, there is a scene of Kanal picking a rotten orange from a tree (these scenes are usually cut out when VH1 airs this video). The majority of the video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; takes place on Stage 2 at Mack Sennett Studios in Silver Lake as the band plays. Other scenes tell the story of how the media mainly focused on Stefani while the band was always in the background. The second half of the video features snippets of live footage filmed during the band&#x27;s performance with Dog Eat Dog and Goldfinger at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City on August 21, 1996. The video also features a short footage showing Dumont playing together with Foo Fighters&#x27;s guitarist Pat Smear. The video ends with Kanal replacing the orange in the tree, which is actually footage of Kanal in reverse pulling the orange off.

Tensions in the band had been running high and they reportedly were on the verge of breaking up the day before they were scheduled to film the video. They decided to go ahead and film it as a form of &quot;therapy&quot;.

The video won the award for Best Group Video and was nominated for Video of the Year at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards. It has one billion views on YouTube as of May 2023, and 700 million of the views come from 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 alone. The video, now remastered in 4K, was uploaded on October 7, 2009.

There is an alternate version of the video showing just the live performance part. Both versions of the video are included on the DVD release &quot;The Videos 1992–2003&quot; (2004).

<text>El Sayyid Nosair (; born 16 November 1955) is a convicted killer, currently serving a life sentence. An Egyptian-born American citizen, he assassinated Meir Kahane in 1990 in New York City, and was later convicted of involvement in the 1993 New York City landmark bomb plot. Nosair was acquitted in his initial trial on murder charges for the assassination of Kahane, but in his later trial was found to have committed the murder.

In 1994, Nosair was convicted in federal court of nine counts, including seditious conspiracy, murder in aid of racketeering, attempted murder in aid of racketeering, attempted murder of a U.S. Postal Inspection Service officer, use of a firearm in the commission of a murder, use of a firearm during an attempted murder, and possession of a firearm. Nosair&#x27;s murder of Kahane was one of the acts in the conspiracy for which he was convicted.

==Background==
El Sayyid Nosair was born in 1955 in Port Said, Egypt, and immigrated to the United States in 1981. He became an American citizen in 1989. In the United States, Nosair worked various jobs in New Jersey and New York City. Nosair was employed by the City of New York to repair the air conditioning equipment at the criminal courts building.

Nosair expressed dislike for American culture and what he perceived to be rampant moral corruption. Nosair became involved with the al-Farouq Mosque in Brooklyn, which was supported by the Maktab al-Khidamat (Afghanistan Services Bureau). The Maktab al-Khidamat was established in 1984 by Osama bin Laden and Abdullah Azzam in Peshawar, Pakistan to raise funds for the Arab mujahadeen during the Soviet–Afghan War, and later to recruit participants in al Qaeda. Ali Mohamed, a sergeant at Fort Bragg, provided United States Army manuals and other assistance to individuals at the al-Farouq Mosque, and some members, including Mahmoud Abouhalima and Nosair, practiced at the Calverton Shooting Range on Long Island, many of the group wearing shirts reading &quot;Help Each Other in Goodness and Piety ... A Muslim to a Muslim is a Brick Wall&quot; with a map of Afghanistan emblazoned in the middle.

==Assassination of Meir Kahane==
In 1990, Nosair assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane, formerly a member of the Israeli Knesset, and founder of the Jewish Defense League and Kach. Nosair shot Kahane on November 5, 1990, shortly after 9:00p.m., following a speech to a Jewish group at in midtown Manhattan&#x27;s Marriott East Side Hotel. Nosair ran up and shot Kahane as he was answering questions following his speech. Nosair attempted to flee the scene and commandeer a taxi, but he was shot by Carlos Acosta, a police officer for the United States Postal Inspection Service. The two continued to exchange gunfire before Nosair was apprehended. Nosair and his victims were evacuated to Bellevue Hospital for treatment of their wounds, and Kahane was pronounced dead at the hospital.

===Trial===
During legal proceedings, Nosair largely ignored the court and focused on multiple sketches he made of Princess Diana.

In a verdict described by law professor Jeffrey B. Abramson as &quot;bizarre&quot;, a jury in December 1991 acquitted Nosair of Kahane&#x27;s murder but convicted him of assaulting Acosta and possessing an illegal firearm. He was defended by William Kunstler (along with two co-counsels), who at first advised him to plead insanity. When Nosair refused, the defense argued that there had been a conspiracy against Nosair, and Kahane might have been killed by one of his followers. Kunstler saw the composition of the jury (which he described as being made up of &quot;third-world people&quot; and &quot;people who were not yuppies or establishment types&quot;) as crucial to the verdict.

The judge in the trial, Justice Alvin Schlesinger, said that the jury&#x27;s acquittal of Nosair on the murder charge was &quot;against the overwhelming weight of evidence and was devoid of common sense and logic&quot;. The judge added that he believed Nosair &quot;conducted a rape of this country, of our Constitution and of our laws, and of people seeking to exist peacefully together.&quot; On January 29, 1992, he sentenced Nosair to 7 to 22 years in prison, the maximum allowed.

Kunstler also saw the verdict as irrational, promising to appeal Nosair&#x27;s convictions. However, Nosair was unsuccessful in several efforts to overturn the verdict.

===Conspiracy to free Nosair from prison===
Nosair was originally sentenced to serve his time at the Attica State Prison in New York. It was reported that prior to his arrest, Omar Abdel-Rahman (the &quot;Blind Sheikh&quot;) and his followers had conducted detailed surveillance of the facility, and they had also discussed plans to rescue Nosair from prison by launching a truck bomb attack combined with an armed assault.

==Terrorist conspiracy conviction==
Nosair was still serving time in state prison when he was convicted as part of the federal trial of the &quot;Blind Sheik&quot; Omar Abdel-Rahman. Both received life sentences without the possibility of parole for their involvement in a terrorist conspiracy, in Nosair&#x27;s case life plus 15 years&#x27; imprisonment. It was ruled that Nosair&#x27;s murder of Kahane was part of the &quot;seditious conspiracy&quot;. Nosair was convicted of nine counts, including conspiracy to use explosives against New York landmarks, seditious conspiracy, plotting to assassinate U.S. politicians, murder of Kahane in aid of racketeering, attempted murder in aid of racketeering, attempted murder of a postal police officer, use of a firearm in the commission of a murder, use of a firearm in an attempted murder, and possession of a firearm; he received life plus 15 years of imprisonment. Nosair&#x27;s relatives obtained funds from Osama bin Laden to pay for Nosair&#x27;s defense.

==Link to Osama bin Laden==
In 2002, Eleanor Hill, director of the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating intelligence failures prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks, reported that Nosair had links with terrorist organizations in Pakistan and that Osama bin Laden helped pay for his legal defense during his trial for the assassination of Meir Kahane. The FBI learned that one of Nosair&#x27;s relatives traveled to Saudi Arabia and acquired funds from Osama bin Laden to fund Nosair&#x27;s legal defense. Ron Kuby, one of Nosair&#x27;s lawyers, later stated that a cousin of Nosair&#x27;s had pooled money together with Nosair&#x27;s family to raise money for his legal defense.

==Possible accomplices in Kahane&#x27;s assassination==
In August 2010, the Israeli newspaper &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, referencing a story in &quot;Playboy&quot; summarizing FBI memos, claimed that Nosair had two partners and that his original target was Israeli military figure and future Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon. The article states that in 2005 Nosair stated to FBI investigators &quot;that on the night he shot Kahane dead, he was accompanied by two co-conspirators to the Marriot Hotel in Manhattan where Kahane was speaking – one of whom was also carrying a gun.&quot; The men, Bilal al-Kaisi (also known as Bilal Elqisi), a Jordanian, and Mohammed A. Salameh, a Palestinian, have never been charged for their part in the slaying, but both were linked to al Qaeda and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Salameh was convicted of his part in the terrorist conspiracy, but Al Kaisi was convicted of a minor immigration violation and released.

==Family==
Nosair married Karen Mills, a native of Pittsburgh who changed her given name to Khadijah when she converted from Roman Catholicism to Islam in 1982. The couple had two sons, and they raised a daughter from Khadijah&#x27;s previous marriage. One of Nosair&#x27;s sons, born Abdulaziz El Sayyid Nosair, changed his name to Zak Ebrahim and now works as a peace activist. He released his first book, &quot;The Terrorist&#x27;s Son: A Story of Choice&quot; in September 2014.

<doc id="379647" wikidata="Q650836" url="?curid=379647" title="Yellowstone Caldera">
<text>Yellowstone Caldera, also known as the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field, is a Quaternary caldera complex and volcanic plateau spanning parts of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. It is driven by the Yellowstone hotspot and is largely within Yellowstone National Park. The field comprises four overlapping calderas, multiple lava domes, resurgent domes, crater lakes, and numerous bimodal lavas and tuffs of basaltic and rhyolitic composition, originally covering about .

Volcanism began 2.15 million years ago and proceeded through three major volcanic cycles. Each cycle involved a large ignimbrite eruption, continental-scale ash-fall, and caldera collapse, preceded and followed by smaller lava flows and tuffs. The first and also the largest cycle was the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff eruption about 2.08 million years ago, which formed the Island Park Caldera. The most recent supereruption, about 0.63 million years ago, produced the Lava Creek Tuff and created the present Yellowstone Caldera. Post-caldera eruptions included basalt flows, rhyolite domes and flows, and minor explosive deposits, with the last magmatic eruption about 70,000 years ago. Large hydrothermal explosions also occurred during the Holocene.

From 2004 to 2009, the region experienced notable uplift attributed to new magma injection. The 2005 docudrama &quot;Supervolcano&quot;, produced by the &quot;BBC&quot; and the &quot;Discovery Channel&quot;, increased public attention on the potential for a future catastrophic eruption. The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory monitors volcanic activity and does not consider an eruption imminent. Imaging of the magma reservoir indicates a substantial volume of partial melt beneath Yellowstone that is not currently eruptible.

== Geology ==

The Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field lies at the eastern end of the Snake River Plain and disrupts the continuity of the Laramide orogenic belt, which formed during the Late Cretaceous. From about 53 to 43 million years ago, this area experienced significant andesitic volcanism exceeding in total volume, forming the Absaroka Volcanic
Supergroup. Prominent peaks such as Mount Washburn and Eagle Peak are eroded remnants of these earlier stratovolcanoes. Before the formation of the Yellowstone Plateau, the Teton Range and Madison Range were likely structurally continuous, as were the Red Mountains and Gallatin Range. 

Current Yellowstone volcanism is not a continuation of Laramide tectonism or the Absaroka volcanic province. Instead, it is the most recent part of a linear age-progression of rhyolitic complexes along the Snake River Plain, extending at least 16 million years to the McDermitt caldera complex. Large rhyolitic tuff supereruptions occurred at these older eruptive centers. One is the 12.1 million-year-old Ibex Hollow Tuff from the Bruneau-Jarbidge volcanic field in southern Idaho, burying herds of Nebraska mammals under volcanic ash. Older volcanics proposed to be part of this hotspot track include the 56 million-year-old Siletzia oceanic plateau and the 70 million-year-old Carmacks Group.

The cause of the northeastward progression of volcanism is debated. Some models invoke only upper-mantle processes, such as mantle pushed upward by the leading edge of the subducting Farallon plate, slab rollback, a propagating rift, or mantle convection driven by abrupt changes in thermal layer thickness at the continent–ocean boundary. A proposed lower-mantle origin suggests a fragment of the subducting Farallon slab penetrated the discontinuity, pushing up the lower mantle and triggering melting of water-rich transition zone beneath the western United States. Alternatively, a long-lived mantle plume rooted at the core–mantle boundary has been proposed. The plume erupted the Columbia River Basalt Group and is now feeding the Yellowstone hotspot. Seismic tomography has revealed a wide, cylindrical thermal anomaly extending from the deepest mantle to just beneath Yellowstone, supporting the mantle plume origin. In this model, the North American Plate moves southwest at about per year over the relatively stationary plume, creating the observed age-progression of eruptive centers.

=== Structure of calderas ===
The northern and eastern extent of the first-cycle caldera are unknown due to burial, although it likely reached into the third-cycle caldera, perhaps east of the Central Plateau. The Huckleberry Ridge Tuff in the Red Mountains is interpreted as thick intracaldera fill of the Island Park Caldera, and Big Bend Ridge at the southwestern edge of the volcanic plateau is inferred to be part of its caldera wall. A fault along the Snake River and Glade Creek, bounding the northern end of Teton Range and Huckleberry Ridge, is also thought to be part of the Island Park ring-fault. It is not known whether any of the first-cycle caldera segments was resurgent. 

The second-cycle caldera is known as the Henry&#x27;s Fork Caldera. Thurmon Ridge at the northwestern edge of the volcanic plateau is inferred to be its northern caldera wall. The fault along Big Bend Ridge was reactivated, collapsing again during the second-cycle caldera formation. Although basalt flows bury its southern and eastern boundary, a positive gravity anomaly indicates a circular caldera about in diameter, with its southern boundary in the middle of the Island Park basin.

Robert L. Christiansen inferred that the Yellowstone Caldera is a compound caldera comprising two partially overlapping ring-fault zones, centered on the resurgent Mallard Lake dome and Sour Creek dome. The southwest boundary is unconstrained due to post-caldera rhyolite burial, but he proposed that the south flank of Purple Mountain and the Washburn Range, along with the west flank of the Absaroka Range, mark the caldera boundary on the north and east sides. Lewis Falls, Lake Butte, and Flat Mountain Arm of Yellowstone Lake are also part of the Yellowstone caldera rim. However, the purported Sour Creek ring-fault zone and the location of the eastern caldera boundary have been challenged. More recent field mappings suggest the eastern ring-fault lies west of Sour Creek dome, closely following the Yellowstone River. 

The most western portion of Yellowstone Lake is the elliptical West Thumb Basin, which includes one of the lake’s deepest areas. It is interpreted as a fourth caldera, formed by a third-cycle post-caldera explosive eruption.

==Eruption history==
A total of of rhyolite and of basalt were emplaced over three volcanic cycles between about 2.15 million and 0.07 million years ago. Each cycle lasted roughly three-quarters of a million years. The sequence of events in each cycle is similar: a catastrophic rhyolitic ash-flow sheet and caldera collapse, preceded and followed by eruptions of rhyolitic lavas and tuffs and basaltic eruptions near the caldera margin. Ash-flow sheets account for more than half of the total volcanic volume of the Yellowstone Plateau.

=== First-cycle ===
The first-cycle lasted from about 2.15 million to 1.95 million years ago, spanning approximately 200 kyr. The only known pre-collapse rhyolitic unit is the Rhyolite of Snake River Butte, located just north of Ashton and dated at , roughly 60–70 kyr before the caldera-forming Huckleberry Ridge Tuff. Its vent lies near the eventual first-cycle caldera margin close to the Big Bend Bridge. Additional rhyolite flows may have erupted along the incipient ring-fault, but the pre-collapse rhyolite history likely spans no more than ~70 kyr. Another pre-collapse unit is the -thick Junction Butte Basalt on the northeastern margin of the plateau, dated at . The Overhanging Cliff basalt is a flow of this unit.

The first-cycle caldera-forming event was the eruption of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff at ago, during transitional magnetic polarity. Its thickness exceeds in the Red Mountains area. The initial Plinian phase deposited up to of fallout ash at Mount Everts before transitioning to ash-flow tuff. Early Plinian activity was intermittant, sourced from multiple vents, probably lasted a few weeks and evacuated about of magma from four magma bodies, triggering caldera collapse at the onset of transition to ash-flow.
The ash-flow tuff is a composite sheet consisted of three intermittent members, with a total magma volume of about . Member A likely vented from the plateau&#x27;s central area and tapped nine magma bodies. After a hiatus of a few weeks or more, the most voluminous Member B erupted from north of Big Bend Ridge. After another extended break of years to decades, part of the Member A magmatic system was rejuvenated to feed Member C. The least voluminous Member C might have source area near the Red Mountains, where it is about thick. Some outcrops of Member A and Member C have been misidentified as Member B, complicating volume estimates of individual ash-flow unit. Glen A. Izett estimated that an additional of ash was dispersed as fallout across North America. Tephra fallout from this event is known as the Huckleberry Ridge ash bed (formerly &quot;Pearlette type B&quot;). Its areal coverage exceeds .. It is widely distributed and has been identified in the Pacific Ocean at Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 36, about from Island Park Caldera, as well as in the Humboldt and Ventura basins of coastal California, near Afton in Iowa, Benson in Arizona, and Campo Grande Mountain in Texas.

One lava flow near the Sheridan Reservoir and two flows at the north end of Big Bend Ridge are post-collapse rhyolites of the first-cycle volcanism. The Sheridan Reservoir Rhyolite, dated at , if vented from the Island Park ring-fracture, required a flow distance of at least . Its volume is estimated to exceed . The other two flows, the Blue Creek flow and the overlying Headquarters flow, have a combined volume of and erupted respectively at and ago.

=== Second-cycle ===
After ~500 kyr of quiescence, a new magmatic system formed north of Big Bend Ridge. It erupted the Bishop Mountain Flow at and the Tuff of Lyle Spring at . The Bishop Mountain Flow is a rhyolite with an exposed volume of about and reaches a thickness of along the inner caldera wall. The Tuff of Lyle Spring is a , composite ash-flow sheet consisting of two cooling units. Both eruptions appear to have originated from an isolated, highly evolved local magma chamber distinct from the second-cycle magma source. Tiffany A. Rivera et al. (2017) suggest these two eruptions should not be assigned to the second cycle but instead represent the separate Lyle Spring magmatic system.
The next pre-collapse rhyolite eruption is the Green Canyon Flow in the north of Big Bend Ridge, with a mapped volume of about , dated at . Its age is indistinguishable from that of the subsequent Mesa Falls Tuff, but the Henry&#x27;s Fork Caldera fracture truncates the Green Canyon Flow, indicating it predates the second-cycle caldera.

The second-cycle caldera-forming eruption was the Mesa Falls Tuff, dated at . Its exposed thickness exceeds on Thurmon Ridge, though it is likely much thicker within the caldera. During the initial Plinian phase, about of ash and pumice were deposited around the Ashton area, while much of the vitric ash dispersed to more distal regions, as inferred from the high crystal content of the local deposit. This airfall is overlain by a pyroclastic surge layer also enriched in crystals. A single cooling unit of ash-flow tuff followed, covering about with an estimated volume of . The Mesa Falls ash bed (formerly &quot;Pearlette type S&quot;) is the distal ash-fall of this eruption, found in Brainard and Hartington in Nebraska, and in the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado.

Post-collapse eruptions included the Moonshine Mountain dome and five rhyolite domes collectively known as the Island Park Rhyolite. The Moonshine Mountain dome, with an estimated volume of , erupted at . While its age is indistinguishable from the Mesa Falls Tuff, field evidence indicates it formed after the collapse of the Henry&#x27;s Fork Caldera. The dome&#x27;s magma source is likely the same region that supplied the Bishop Mountain Flow.
The Island Park Rhyolite comprises five bodies: Silver Lake dome, Osborne Butte dome, Elk Butte dome, Lookout Butte dome, and Warm River Butte dome. These domes collectively have a total volume of . All five erupted within a few centuries, around , during a single eruptive episode. While Lookout Butte is located on the rim of Big Bend Ridge caldera wall, the vents for the other four domes align along a northwest-trending, structurally controlled linear vent zone about long and no more than wide.

=== Third-cycle ===
Pre-collapse third-cycle silicic rocks are broadly divided into the Mount Jackson Rhyolite and the Lewis Canyon Rhyolite, which vented along what later became the ring-fracture zone of the third-cycle caldera.
The earliest known lava in this cycle is the Wapiti Lake flow of the Mount Jackson group, dated at , exposed near the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and likely vented near Wapiti Lake. Another flow, the Moose Creek Butte flow (), also belongs to the Mount Jackson group. Although younger than the Island Park Rhyolite, its geochemical similarity has led some researchers to propose it as a second-cycle post-collapse eruption. Pumice of an unknown tuff unit at Broad Creek has an age range from to .
Later Mount Jackson eruptions include the Flat Mountain Rhyolite () and the Harlequin Lake flow (). The Lewis Canyon Rhyolite group contains lavas dated to , though Robert L. Christiansen suggests they could be late-stage first-cycle eruptions.
A recently discovered ash-flow unit is dated to . An explosive eruption deposited pumiceous fallout near Harlequin Lake, which is immediately overlain by the Mount Haynes lava (). An ash bed from a Yellowstone eruption was deposited in the Great Salt Lake approximately ago.
The age of the Big Bear Lake flow is uncertain, but it lies beneath the third-cycle caldera-forming Lava Creek Tuff. Additional Mount Jackson flows may be buried within the Yellowstone caldera, inferred from intracaldera topography.

The climatic ash-flow eruption of the third cycle was the Lava Creek Tuff, dated at , during a glacial–interglacial transition in the Marine Isotope Stage. This composite tuff sheet consists of at least two members, distinguishable by a widely occurring welding intensity decrease between them, and represents a total ash-flow volume of about .
Member A likely erupted south of Purple Mountain, where it reaches its greatest thickness of and exhibits maximum welding. The Purple Mountain to Gibbon Canyon segment of caldera wall collapsed after the emplacement of Member A but before it completely cooled. A loose crystal ash unit separates Member A from Member B, indicating a break in the eruption sufficiently long for cooling of thick ash-flows. A thick pumiceous ash-fall deposit underlies Member B and probably marks its initial phase. Member B ash-flows extends radially outward along paleovalleys and more extensive plateau segments. The eruptive center for Member B appears to be situated farther east compared to that of Member A. However, this simplistic eruptive sequence has been challenged. An additional ash-flow unit (informally named unit 2) has been identified, venting from around Bog Creek. Unit 2 erupted some decades after Member A had cooled and overlies tuff fragments from Member A. Two additional rhyolite ash-flow units (unit 3 and unit 4) have been recognized, erupting from a vent near Stonetop Mountain and are previously undocumented parts of the Lava Creek Tuff. An unknown welded tuff underlying Member B at Flagg Ranch, not attributed to Member A, was emplaced shortly before the initial ashfall of Member B and is considered part of the early Lava Creek eruption. Rather than having the simple structure of just two ignimbrite sheets, the Lava Creek Tuff may consist of multiple ash-flow lobes from distinct magma bodies. The ash fallout from the Lava Creek Tuff eruption is known as the Lava Creek ash bed (formerly &quot;Pearlette type O&quot;), covering an area exceeding . Perkins and Nash (2002) estimated that the volume of this ash bed is greater than . It has been identified in the Gulf of Mexico, near Regina, Saskatchewan, in Ventura, California, and in Viola Center, Iowa.

==== Post-collapse rhyolites ====
Post-collapse rhyolites likely erupted shortly after the Lava Creek Tuff. The subaerial post-collapse silicic rocks are collectively referred to as the Plateau Rhyolite, which primarily consists of lava flows. Plateau Rhyolite is divided into three intracaldera members—Upper Basin Member, Mallard Lake Member, and Central Plateau Member—and two extracaldera members—Obsidian Creek Member and Roaring Mountain Member. It is likely that rhyolitic pumice and ash were erupted during the opening of vents for each of these lava flows.
The earliest intracaldera rhyolite, the East Biscuit Basin Flow of the Upper Basin Member, is dated to , followed by felsic lithic clasts of an unknown unit () in Yellowstone Lake, and the North Biscuit Basin Flow (). The earliest extracaldera rhyolite is the Riverside Flow () of the Roaring Mountain Member, broadly contemporaneous with the Middle Biscuit Basin Flow (). Two ash-flow tuff units of the Upper Basin Member include the -thick Tuff of Uncle Tom’s Trail and the -thick Tuff of Sulphur Creek, the latter dated at . These tuffs were deposited on the north flank of the Sour Creek dome. The Canyon lava flows of the Upper Basin Member erupted immediately after the Tuff of Sulphur Creek, as the ash-flow was still hot at the time of emplacement. Both the Tuff of Sulphur Creek and Canyon flows originated from a vent near Fern Lake. The two tuffs and Canyon flows have a combined magma volume of .
The Dunraven Road Flow () of the Upper Basin Member overlies the Canyon flows and may have had an extracaldera vent. The Cougar Creek lava dome of the Roaring Mountain Member erupted north of the caldera.
Four additional lava flows of the Obsidian Creek Member—Willow Park dome, Apollinaris Spring dome, Gardner River complex, and Grizzly Lake complex—erupted between and , in the vicinity of Norris Geyser Basin northward toward Mammoth Hot Springs. The South Biscuit Basin Flow of the Upper Basin Member erupted ago. The Scaup Lake Flow of the Upper Basin Member is dated to , while the Landmark dome of the Obsidian Creek Member is .

Non-explosive eruptions of lava and less-violent explosive eruptions have occurred in and near the Yellowstone caldera since the last supereruption. The most recent lava flow occurred about 70,000 years ago, while a violent eruption excavated the West Thumb of Lake Yellowstone 174,000 years ago. Smaller steam explosions occur as well. An explosion 13,800 years ago left a diameter crater at Mary Bay on the edge of Yellowstone Lake (located in the center of the caldera). Currently, volcanic activity is exhibited via numerous geothermal vents scattered throughout the region, including the famous Old Faithful Geyser, plus recorded ground-swelling indicating ongoing inflation of the underlying magma chamber.
==Hazards==
===Earthquakes===

Volcanic and tectonic actions in the region cause between 1,000 and 2,000 measurable earthquakes annually. Most are relatively minor, measuring magnitude 3 or weaker. Occasionally, numerous earthquakes are detected in a relatively short period of time, an event known as an earthquake swarm. In 1985, more than 3,000 earthquakes were measured over a period of several months. More than 70 smaller swarms were detected between 1983 and 2008. The USGS states these swarms are likely caused by slips on pre-existing faults rather than by movements of magma or hydrothermal fluids.

In December 2008, continuing into January 2009, more than 500 earthquakes were detected under the northwest end of Yellowstone Lake over a seven-day span, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.9. Another swarm started in January 2010, after the Haiti earthquake and before the Chile earthquake. With 1,620 small earthquakes between January 17, 2010, and February 1, 2010, this swarm was the second-largest ever recorded in the Yellowstone Caldera. The largest of these shocks was a magnitude 3.8 that occurred on January 21, 2010. This swarm subsided to background levels by February 21. On March 30, 2014, at 6:34 AM MST, a magnitude 4.8 earthquake struck Yellowstone, the largest recorded there since February 1980. In February 2018, more than 300 earthquakes occurred, with the largest being a magnitude 2.9.

===Volcanoes===

The Lava Creek eruption of the Yellowstone Caldera, which occurred 640,000 years ago, ejected approximately of rock, dust and volcanic ash into the atmosphere. It was Yellowstone&#x27;s third and most recent caldera-forming eruption.

Geologists closely monitor the elevation of the Yellowstone Plateau, which has been rising as quickly as per year, as an indirect measurement of changes in magma chamber pressure.

The upward movement of the Yellowstone caldera floor between 2004 and 2008—almost each year—was more than three times greater than ever observed since such measurements began in 1923. From 2004 to 2008, the land surface within the caldera moved upward as much as at the White Lake GPS station. In January 2010, the USGS stated that &quot;uplift of the Yellowstone Caldera has slowed significantly&quot; and that uplift continues but at a slower pace. USGS, University of Utah and National Park Service scientists with the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory maintain that they &quot;see no evidence that another such cataclysmic eruption will occur at Yellowstone in the foreseeable future. Recurrence intervals of these events are neither regular nor predictable.&quot; This conclusion was reiterated in December 2013 in the aftermath of the publication of a study by University of Utah scientists finding that the &quot;size of the magma body beneath Yellowstone is significantly larger than had been thought&quot;. The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory issued a statement on its website stating:

Although fascinating, the new findings do not imply increased geologic hazards at Yellowstone, and certainly do not increase the chances of a &#x27;supereruption&#x27; in the near future. Contrary to some media reports, Yellowstone is not &#x27;overdue&#x27; for a supereruption.

Media reports were more hyperbolic in their coverage.

A study published in &quot;GSA Today&quot;, the monthly news and science magazine of the Geological Society of America, identified three fault zones where future eruptions are most likely to be centered. Two of those areas are associated with lava flows aged 174,000–70,000 years ago, and the third is a focus of present-day seismicity.

In 2017, NASA conducted a study to determine the feasibility of preventing the volcano from erupting. The results suggested that cooling the magma chamber by 35 percent would be enough to forestall such an incident. NASA proposed introducing water at high pressure 10 kilometers underground. The circulating water would release heat at the surface, possibly in a way that could be used as a geothermal power source. If enacted, the plan would cost about $3.46 billion. Brian Wilcox of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory observes that such a project could incidentally trigger an eruption if the top of the chamber is drilled into.

According to analysis of earthquake data in 2013, the magma chamber is long and wide. It also has underground volume, of which 6–8% is filled with molten rock. This is about 2.5 times bigger than scientists had previously imagined; however, scientists believe that the proportion of molten rock in the chamber is too low to allow for another supereruption.

In October 2017, research from Arizona State University indicated prior to Yellowstone&#x27;s last supereruption, magma surged into the magma chamber in two large influxes. An analysis of crystals from Yellowstone&#x27;s lava showed that prior to the last supereruption, the magma chamber underwent a rapid increase in temperature and change in composition. The analysis indicated that Yellowstone&#x27;s magma reservoir can reach eruptive capacity and trigger a super-eruption within just decades, not centuries as volcanologists had originally thought.

===Hydrothermal explosions===

The volcanic eruptions, as well as the continuing geothermal activity, are a result of a great plume of magma located below the caldera&#x27;s surface. The magma in this plume contains gases that are kept dissolved by the immense pressure under which the magma is contained. If the pressure is released to a sufficient degree by some geological shift, then some of the gases bubble out and cause the magma to expand. This can cause a chain reaction. If the expansion results in further relief of pressure, for example, by blowing crust material off the top of the chamber, the result is a very large gas explosion.

Studies and analysis may indicate that the greater hazard comes from hydrothermal activity which occurs independently of volcanic activity. Over 20 large craters have been produced in the past 14,000 years, resulting in such features as Mary Bay, Turbid Lake, and Indian Pond, which was created in an eruption about 1300 BC.

In a 2003 report, USGS researchers proposed that an earthquake may have displaced more than of water in Yellowstone Lake, creating colossal waves that unsealed a capped geothermal system and led to the hydrothermal explosion that formed Mary Bay.

Further research shows that very distant earthquakes reach and have effects upon the activities at Yellowstone, such as the 1992 7.3 magnitude Landers earthquake in California&#x27;s Mojave Desert that triggered a swarm of quakes from more than away, and the 2002 7.9 magnitude Denali fault earthquake away in Alaska that altered the activity of many geysers and hot springs for several months afterward.

In 2016, the USGS announced plans to map the subterranean systems responsible for feeding the area&#x27;s hydrothermal activity. According to the researchers, these maps could help predict when another eruption occurs.

== Cultural significance ==

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of it being &quot;well-known for its past explosive volcanic eruptions and lava flows as well for its world class hydrothermal system&quot;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included &quot;The Yellowstone volcanic and hydrothermal system&quot; in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organization defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &quot;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history&quot;.

<doc id="379649" wikidata="Q1324392" url="?curid=379649" title="Tokyo Yakult Swallows">
<text>The Tokyo Yakult Swallows () are a Japanese professional baseball team competing in Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s Central League. Based in Shinjuku, Tokyo, they are one of two professional baseball teams in Tokyo, the other being the Yomiuri Giants. They have won nine Central League championships and six Japan Series championships. Since 1964, they have played their home games at Meiji Jingu Stadium.

The Swallows are named after their corporate owners, Yakult Honsha. From 1950 to 1965, the team was owned by the former Japanese National Railways (known as Kokutetsu (国鉄) in Japanese) and called the Kokutetsu Swallows; the team was then owned by the newspaper &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; from 1965 to 1968 and called the Sankei Atoms. Yakult purchased the team in 1970 and renamed it the Yakult Atoms, before renaming it again as the Yakult Swallows in 1974, and then the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in 2006.

==Kokutetsu and Sankei era (1950–1969)==
The franchise was established for the first time in 1950 when the team was created by the owners of what was then Japanese National Railways (now the privatized Japan Railways Group). The team name was made the Kokutetsu Swallows. The team never finished with a winning record in their entire first decade of the 1950s. In 1961, the team ended up being third in the league for first time in their team history. Konkutetsu chose &quot;Swallows&quot; as JNR had an express railway, which at the time, was the fastest in Japan, which was named Tsubame (or swallow in English). Other name ideas were railway themed, such as &quot;Service&quot; or &quot;Whistles&quot;. Express was also considered, but was put out, due to fears within JNR of the team&#x27;s name in headlines like &quot;Express crashing&quot; when the team was in a slump, or &quot;Express explodes&quot; when the team began winning a lot. (This similar issue would be the reason why Randy Bass would have his name lengthened in Japanese as &quot;Bāsu&quot; (バース, pronounced ), due to Hanshin owning a bus line at the time, and bus in Japanese is known as &quot;basu&quot; (バス), which would similarly have a negative impact on Hanshin&#x27;s bus line.)

Pitcher Masaichi Kaneda, nicknamed &quot;The Emperor&quot;, starred for the team during this era and was the league&#x27;s most dominant pitcher. Kaneda holds numerous career records in the Japanese leagues. For the Swallows, he went 14 straight seasons with at least 20 wins, led the league in strikeouts 10 times, wins three times, ERA three times, and won the Eiji Sawamura Award three times. Kaneda pitched for the Swallows from 1950 to 1964.

In 1965, the team was bought by Sankei Shimbun and Sankei retained the Swallows name for 1 year before switching their name to the Atoms, as they were one of the leading advocates of nuclear energy and because of Astro Boy, which is known as Mighty Atom in Japan, hence the name of the team. Astro Boy would then be part of the team&#x27;s logo. Sankei, however, underestimated how costly running a baseball team was, and their ownership would only last 3 seasons.

==Yakult era (1970–2005)==
In 1970, Sankei Shimbun offloaded the team to Yakult Honsha, and Yakult kept the Atoms name for 3 seasons before changing the name, as by 1973, Mushi Production, the creators of Astro Boy, went bankrupt. Originally, Yakult ran a poll to determine the new name, and announced the winning name, Jaguars, at the 1973 All Star break, and the name was supposed to take effect starting the 1974 season. However, amidst fan pressure, Yakult dropped the idea, and reverted to the Swallows name. Sankei kept a minority stake in the team, negotiating a deal that broadcasts all Swallows home games on Fuji TV ONE.

The team won its first Japan Series championship in 1978.

In 1990, Katsuya Nomura became the new manager of Swallows, making drastic changes in the team. Although his first year with the Swallows resulted in them finishing in fifth place, the Swallows improved to third in the league the next year for the first time since 1980. From 1992 to 2001, the team won five Central League championships, prevailing in the Japan Series in 1993, 1995, 1997, and 2001. (Nomura managed the team to the first three of those championships.)

==Tokyo Yakult era (2006–present)==

In 2006, Tokyo was added to the team name, resulting in the team name of Tokyo Yakult Swallows, and the logo of Tokyo was added to the uniform for the first time since the Kokutetsu era. The team maintained a winning percentage of .500, and ended up in third place in the league.

2011 was an impressive year for the Swallows. In April, the Swallows topped the Central League and kept 1st place until September when the Chunichi Dragons climbed to win in the pennant race, ultimately leaving the Swallows in 2nd place in the Central League.

The Swallows entered the Climax Series in 2009, and faced the Yomiuri Giants for the stage 1, which ultimately resulted in a 2–1 victory. Swallows advanced for their first time into stage 2 and faced the defending Central League champions, the Chunichi Dragons. The Swallows eventually lost against the Dragons by 2–4, ending their postseason. At the end of season, Hirotoshi Ishii retired from the team.

In 2012, Norichika Aoki was posted to the Milwaukee Brewers. On 19 March 2012, the main office was moved to Kita-Aoyama which is located close to the Meiji Jingu Stadium from Higashi-Shinbashi.

In 2013, Swallows outfielder Wladimir Balentien broke the NPB single-season home run record, finishing the season with 60 home runs. This was majorly due to the league secretly introducing a more juiced ball that allowed more home runs to be scored, which caused three-term NPB commissioner Ryozo Kato to resign when the juiced ball was found about.

The Swallows finished the 2015 regular season with the Central League&#x27;s best record and defeated the Yomiuri Giants in the Climax Series to advance to the Japan Series, where they lost to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in five games.

The Swallows clinched the 2021 Central League pennant on 26 October 2021 with a 5–1 victory over Yokohama DeNA BayStars, coupled with Hanshin Tigers losing 4-0 to Chunichi Dragons on the same night. The victory clinched the pennant with two games to spare in the regular season. This allowed them to advance to the final stage of the Climax Series, sweeping the Yomiuri Giants, 3-0, to advance to the Japan Series. They eventually won the series against the Orix Buffaloes in six games to win the Japan Series, their first since 2001. They backed it up in 2022 with an 80-59-4 record, winning the 2022 Central League pennant and returning to the Japan Series by sweeping the Hanshin Tigers in the 2022 Central League Climax Series, once again facing the Orix Buffaloes. This time however, the Buffaloes would exact revenge on the Swallows, beating them in the Japan Series in seven games, 4–2–1. Third baseman Munetaka Murakami broke the Japanese-born single season home run record in 2022 with 56 home runs, surpassing Sadaharu Oh&#x27;s record of 55 set in 1964.

==Mascots==

The team&#x27;s mascot is a black swallow with a red face named Tsubakuro (つば九郎). He is known for his feuds with the Orix Buffaloes mascots. He always wears a batting helmet. Whenever the Swallows wear special home unis, Tsubakuro also wears the same.

The number on the back of his uniform is &quot;2896&quot; as opposed to 111/222 used by Buffalo Bull and Buffalo Bell, the Buffaloes&#x27; mascots.

There is also a female swallow mascot named Tsubami. She wears a skirt and may be intended as Tsubakuro&#x27;s little sister, just as Bell is Bull&#x27;s little sister. Unlike her brother, she wears a sports visor.

Before Tsubakuro was created, the teams mascots were Yabo and Sue-Chan (ヤー坊 &amp; スーちゃん), who were the team mascots from 1979 to 1994.

The team also had a third mascot named Torcuya(トルクーヤ), a swallow who resembles a luchador. He always carries around a parasol and a bottle of Yakult that he carries on his back. He were the team mascot from 2014 to present.

The team also had a former mascot named Entaro (燕太郎), a swallow who wore a jersey and his jersey number is 8960. He was replaced by Torcuya in 2014.
== Minor League team==
The Swallows farm team plays in the Eastern League. The team was founded in 1950.

<text>Philip J. Fry, commonly known mononymously by his surname Fry, is a fictional character and the protagonist of the animated series &quot;Futurama&quot;. He is voiced by Billy West using a version of his own voice as he sounded when he was 25. He is a delivery boy from the 20th century who becomes cryogenically frozen and reawakens in the 30th century to become a delivery boy there with an intergalactic delivery company run by his 30th great-grandnephew, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth. He is the best friend and roommate of Bender and the boyfriend and later fiancé of Leela.

==Character overview==
Fry was born in the 20th century in New York City. He is an immature pizza delivery boy who, during the first few seconds of 2000, falls into a cryogenic tank while delivering a pizza to Applied Cryogenics. He remains frozen until the last day of 2999. He then meets the one-eyed cryogenics counselor Leela, as well as the cigar-smoking, alcoholic, kleptomaniac robot Bender. Together, they are employed by Fry&#x27;s distant nephew, the senile and demented old scientist Professor Farnsworth, as the crew of his delivery company Planet Express.

Fry&#x27;s parents are Yancy Fry Sr., a strict Republican who believes in conspiracy theories, and Mrs. Fry (née Gleisner), an avid New York Mets fan. It was later revealed that Fry&#x27;s family on his father&#x27;s side is from New Mexico. Fry had an older brother named Yancy; a dog named Seymour; and a ex-girlfriend named Michelle Jenkins (who dumps him in the first episode, &quot;Space Pilot 3000&quot;, just before he is frozen). Fry had a lifelong sibling rivalry with his older brother Yancy, due to Fry&#x27;s perception that Yancy steals everything from him and vice versa; in &quot;The Luck of the Fryrish&quot;, however, it is revealed his brother loved him dearly, and later named his son after him.

After dropping out of Coney Island Community College, Fry got a job as a delivery boy at Panucci&#x27;s Pizza. Depictions of Fry&#x27;s family in early episodes showed them as extremely dysfunctional, with an inattentive mother and borderline-abusive father. Later seasons, however, depicted them as much closer and, while still dysfunctional, more loving and attentive, with Fry&#x27;s father treating him harshly to ensure he grew up tough.

===Personality and abilities===
Fry is characterized as lazy, gullible, and none-too-bright, but also innocent, playful and kind-hearted. Fry regards Bender as his closest friend despite the latter&#x27;s mean-spirited, selfish nature and constant abuse. He also has strong feelings for Leela, although he lacks the charisma required for properly articulating his emotions. Throughout the early seasons of the show, Leela is shown to have feelings for Fry that she is reluctant to act on due to his immaturity. It isn’t until the movie &quot;&quot; that she admits to loving him back. At the end of that film, they are seen sharing a kiss as they enter a wormhole, and subsequently begin dating. Despite his below-average intelligence, Fry has a soft and tender heart, frequently going the extra mile to help his friends, even if he is oblivious to their problems; he is the only other staff member aside from Professor Farnsworth who genuinely enjoys the company of the ship&#x27;s doctor, Zoidberg. Fry has a strong sense of justice and is far from afraid of standing up for himself and his friends and family. He has shown remarkable skill playing video games, (even mastering the 31st-century&#x27;s version on the Internet), and in &quot;Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV&quot; is seen successfully playing a game despite not looking at the screen. This skill carries over to using Planet Express Ship&#x27;s laser gun. Owing to these elements of his personality, Fry also exhibits remarkable bravery and self-sacrifice on occasion and has even displayed flashes of intuition. He has even proved to be a competent fighter in &quot;Law and Oracle&quot; and &quot;Fun on a Bun&quot;, the latter episode showing that Fry is skilled enough to hold his own against Leela in direct physical combat. He has also survived a heart attack intentionally caused by Bender.

In the episode &quot;The Why of Fry&quot;, Leela&#x27;s seemingly oblivious pet Nibbler reveals himself as the reason for Fry&#x27;s freezing. Due to a time-travel incident in &quot;Roswell That Ends Well&quot;, Fry became his own grandfather, but this genetic defect also means that Fry lacks the Delta brainwave that enables conscious thought, his mind instead consisting of an apparently random assortment of other waves that function as a working mind (Leela compared it to a dress made out of carpet remnants). As a result of this defect, Fry can withstand the intellect-draining onslaught of the evil Brainspawn and is immune to the Dark One&#x27;s mind-reading in &quot;&quot; as well as the mind-controlling power of the Hypnotoad. Due to this quirk, Nibbler&#x27;s race, the Nibblonians, dub him &quot;The Mighty One&quot;. Through prediction (on the eve of 1999, as the Nibblonians lack the ability to travel through time), they guessed that Fry would be the one to save the world from the evil Brainspawn. Because his natural lifespan would not extend to the right millennium, however, Nibbler is sent to make the aforementioned delivery call to push an unsuspecting Fry into the cryogenic tube, to re-emerge December 31, 2999. When Fry learned of this, he briefly allowed the Brainspawn to send him back in time to stop Nibbler from sending him to the future, but after confirming that Nibbler hadn&#x27;t come back in time and was acting only to protect the future, Fry chose to let his past self fall into the tube to preserve the timeline.

In several episodes, he feels nostalgic for the 20th century and attempts to convince his coworkers of the greatness of the century.

===Love life===

====Leela====
Leela is Fry&#x27;s main love interest and later wife. His love for her provides a major plotline throughout the series. Fry first begins to show a serious interest in her from the second season onwards, although she constantly turns him down for other dates due to his immaturity. Still, she says that she loves his boyish charm. Leela initially sees Fry as a friend and nothing more, but deeper affection for him appears occasionally, such as on the numerous occasions when he risks his life for hers (&quot;Love and Rocket&quot;, &quot;The Sting&quot;, &quot;Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences&quot;).

Fry&#x27;s feelings for Leela are openly displayed throughout the series. In &quot;The Sting&quot;, Fry throws himself in front of a baby Queen Bee to protect Leela, resulting in the bee&#x27;s stinger completely penetrating his torso. In &quot;Love and Rocket&quot;, upon noticing that Leela&#x27;s oxygen tank was running on &quot;critical&quot;, he attaches her oxygen tube to his tank, giving her his oxygen and almost asphyxiating himself. In &quot;Parasites Lost&quot;, Fry becomes infected with symbiotic &quot;parasites&quot; which enhance his muscles and intelligence, allowing him to attract Leela&#x27;s romantic attention. However, fearing that Leela was attracted to him only for his worms, he rids himself of them in a failed bid to begin a genuine relationship. In &quot;Time Keeps on Slippin&#x27;&quot;, Fry moves the stars to write a love note to Leela, but the message is blown up before she can read it. In the final episode of the initial run, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Hands are Idle Playthings&quot;, Fry trades hands with the Robot Devil in order to compose an opera about Leela in which they fall in love. When Fry returns the Robot Devil&#x27;s hands to prevent him from forcing Leela to marry him, the opera deteriorates, causing the audience to leave. Fry sadly walks off the stage. Leela is the only one who remains behind, asking Fry not to stop because she wants to hear how it ends. He picks up his holophonor and composes a crude ending in which the stage-Fry and stage-Leela share a single kiss.

In the film &quot;&quot; Leela falls in love with a seemingly perfect man, Lars, and they soon become engaged. However, Lars leaves Leela on her wedding day explaining later that as a time paradox he is doomed, and that he would not marry her only to have her lose him soon after. Through this, he then reveals that he is in fact the time paradox of Fry, who had undergone physical changes due to an explosion and become more mature through 12 years of age and experience.

At the end of the film &quot;&quot;, Leela openly admits to loving Fry, and they commence an openly romantic relationship from the episode &quot;Rebirth&quot; onwards. In &quot;The Prisoner of Benda&quot; they have &quot;sex&quot;, albeit in differing bodies. The on-again, off-again nature of their relationship causes Leela to leave Planet Express and Fry in &quot;Overclockwise&quot;, however by the end of the episode, Leela returns to Planet Express and seemingly reunites with Fry. Bender reveals to both Fry and Leela their &quot;ultimate fate&quot; that he learned while he was overclocked. The audience is never shown the contents, but through their facial expressions, it is clear that while the journey for them may be bumpy, Fry and Leela will ultimately end up happy.

In later episodes, such as &quot;The Butterjunk Effect&quot; and &quot;Fun on a Bun&quot;, Fry and Leela are shown to be in a relationship, though the events of the series precipitate frequent arguments and breakups. These issues are usually resolved within the episode, leaving Fry and Leela still together at the end.

During the season finale &quot;Meanwhile&quot;, Fry decides that it is time for him to propose to Leela. Wanting the moment of his proposal to last longer, he steals Professor Farnsworth&#x27;s time machine remote that turns back time every 10 seconds. When Leela is late, he thinks she has rejected him and attempts suicide by jumping off the building; he sees her arriving just in time, however, and presses the reset button over and over again to keep from hitting the ground. He accidentally breaks the remote and freezes time, leaving himself and Leela as the only unfrozen beings in the universe. Leela accepts Fry&#x27;s proposal, and they have a long, happy unofficial &quot;marriage&quot;. After spending decades traveling the world, they return to the spot where Fry was planning to propose. As they toast to their life together, the Professor shows up and repairs the time machine but informs them it will reset their lives to the moment before he invented the machine, leaving them with no memory of the life they spent together. Fry asks Leela if she wants to go around again with him, and she replies that she does.

The first part of the eighth season, picking up ten years after time was frozen, shows a young-again Fry and Leela continuing their relationship.

====Michelle Jenkins====
Michelle Jenkins (voiced by Kath Soucie in the first appearance, Sarah Silverman in the second appearance) is Fry&#x27;s on-and-off ex-girlfriend from the 20th century. Shortly before Fry is frozen, she dumps him for a man named Constantine (called Charles in &quot;The Cryonic Woman&quot;), whom she later marries. They eventually split up, and she decides to freeze herself to try again in the distant future. She wakes up in 3002, meets Fry again, and restarts her relationship with him. However, she fails to fit into the 31st-century life to which Fry has become so accustomed, and so asks him to freeze himself with her for another thousand years. This plan fails, as does the rekindled relationship, so Fry leaves her. She later is shown in a limousine with the recently unfrozen Pauly Shore. In the episode &quot;Proposition Infinity&quot;, she is again shown with Pauly Shore, and the implication is that they are now married.

====Amy Kroker (née Wong)====
During a trip on the luxury starliner &quot;Titanic&quot;, Amy Wong passes Fry off as her boyfriend to avoid being set up by her parents with an unattractive potential husband. Unfortunately, Leela was also passing Fry off as her fiancé to ward off the attentions of Zapp Brannigan. Potential embarrassment is averted by catastrophic damage to the ship, and Amy wins the battle of the bogus boyfriends.

In &quot;Put Your Head on My Shoulders&quot;, Fry and Amy are trapped together in a desert on Mercury and realize they have a lot in common. While being towed to the nearest gas station to refuel, they have sex in the car. They continue the relationship back home, but Fry intends to end it the day before Valentine&#x27;s Day because he feels that they are spending too much time together. An accident ends with Fry&#x27;s head being temporarily attached to Amy&#x27;s body, causing much tension due to Fry&#x27;s decision to break up and Amy&#x27;s subsequent date, forcing Leela to step in and distract Amy&#x27;s date to save Fry from an awkward situation. Despite their break-up, they remain good friends.

====Morgan Proctor====
In &quot;How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back&quot;, while Hermes was on forced paid leave, Fry had a secret affair with his temporary replacement, Morgan Proctor, due to her fetish for messy men. She informed Fry that no one could know about them, and she&#x27;d deny any mention of it. Fry and Morgan&#x27;s affair ended when Bender caught them, leading her to deprogram Bender so Fry ended their affair.

====Umbriel====
In &quot;The Deep South&quot; after the Planet Express crew discovers the mythical underwater city of Atlanta, Fry starts dating a mermaid named Umbriel. After she shows him the wonders of the deep sea, he decides to stay with her, but changes his mind when he learns how merpeople have sex.

====Mildred Fry====
After an accident with a microwave caused the crew and the professor to be thrown back into time, Fry meets his paternal grandparents in the year 1947 on the Roswell, New Mexico air force base. After realizing that his existence depends on his paternal grandparents having children, Fry tries to protect his grandfather by locking him into an abandoned house in the desert. Unfortunately, the house was a test site for a nuclear bomb which killed his paternal grandfather. After realizing he was still alive after his paternal grandfather died, he decided that Mildred couldn&#x27;t be his paternal grandmother and slept with her after she seduces him. However, Professor then points out that he was still alive because Fry had become his own grandfather by sleeping with Mildred, who really is his paternal grandmother. Fry was disgusted after he realized that he is now the father of his own father. In many episodes, he has a different reaction to the encounter being either proud or disturbed.

====Colleen O&#x27;Hallahan====
During the events of &quot;&quot; Fry meets police chief Colleen O&#x27;Hallahan while observing the tear in the universe and soon begin dating. Their relationship is happy and serious, which makes Leela jealous as she finally came to return . When Fry agrees to move in with Colleen, he learns that she has four other live-in boyfriends. Failing to adjust to her polyandrous marriage he breaks up with her, leaving himself heartbroken. His sadness at losing Colleen leads him to travel into the tear where he meets the alien Yivo who he introduces to the rest of the universe, and the whole universe all come to fall in love with Yivo. Eventually, Yivo later breaks up with the whole universe except Colleen as they both cannot be satisfied being in love with a single person. Before she moves in permanently with Yivo, Colleen thanks Fry for introducing her to Yivo.

==Family relationships==
===Professor Farnsworth===
Professor Hubert Farnsworth is the distant nephew of Philip J. Fry and his only living family member in the 31st century aside from Cubert and Igner. He runs a small delivery service to fund his scientific research and gives Fry, Leela, and Bender jobs. Although the professor is an accomplished scientist, he is often cruel and senile. As of the episode &quot;A Clone of My Own,&quot; he is 160 years old.

===Cubert Farnsworth===
Cubert is the young clone of the professor and is often portrayed as his son. He was created as an heir to all of the professor&#x27;s research, but was kept in the tube too long resulting in a pressed in nose. He often gets into trouble and makes fun of Fry for being dumb. He is also good friends with Dwight Conrad, the son of Hermes.

===Igner===
Igner is the son of the professor and Mom. He was raised by Mom and neither he nor the professor knew who the father was. His father wasn&#x27;t revealed until &quot;Bender&#x27;s Game&quot;.

===Mildred===
Mildred was the grandmother of Fry. During his time in the past, due to an incident with the microwave, Fry accidentally kills his grandfather by locking him in a cabin located in a nuclear test site and returns to Mildred who seduces him after Fry decides that she couldn&#x27;t possibly be his real grandmother because he was still alive. The professor, Leela, and Bender then find Fry in bed with Mildred and point out that because Fry was still alive after his grandfather&#x27;s death, he had become his own grandfather and that he had still slept with his own grandmother.

===Yancy Fry Sr.===
Yancy Senior is the father of Yancy Fry Jr. and Philip J. Fry. He is a large man who is often seen in flashbacks preparing against the &quot;commie invasion&quot; or the Y2K apocalypse. He and his wife often express how much they miss Fry after his disappearance despite numerous flashbacks where they are seen making light of it or suggesting that they made little effort to find him. Fry later traveled back in time and impregnated his grandmother, making him the father of his own father.

===Mrs. Fry===
Fry&#x27;s mother. Fry and his mother seemed to have had a better relationship. Although she often joins in on the jokes about his disappearance, she has expressed sadness over his loss and is able to tell him how much she loved him when Nibbler allows Fry to enter into her dreams and say goodbye.

===Yancy Fry Jr. and Philip J. Fry II===
Yancy Jr. is Fry&#x27;s older brother. Yancy and Philip had an intense sibling rivalry over basketball, dancing, and various other activities. During this time, Fry found a lucky seven-leaf clover that seems to bring him an incredible amount of raw talent at whatever he does. Yancy and Philip are constantly fighting over the clover until Fry decides to hide it in an old record vault. After Fry&#x27;s disappearance, Yancy breaks into the vault to find music he can use at his wedding reception and finds the clover. Yancy ends up giving the clover to his son Philip who he named after his uncle. Fry eventually sees a picture of his nephew, who was the first person on Mars, in the future and believes that it was Yancy Jr. who had stolen his name and his dream of going into space (which the gang points out Fry does every day now). Fry eventually finds Philip&#x27;s grave and decides to rob it in an effort to take back the clover. He has a horrible realization that the grave he was robbing was that of his nephew and not his brother when he clears the headstone and it reads &quot;Here lies Philip J. Fry. Named for his uncle to carry on his spirit.&quot; Fry then places the clover back into the grave and leaves his nephew&#x27;s grave, realizing how much his brother loved and missed him.

Fry&#x27;s nephew appears in person during &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot;. Bender travels back in time to the year 2012, intent on assassinating Fry. He encounters a young boy who shares Fry&#x27;s name and prepares to kill him, but stops when the boy says that Fry is his uncle.

==Production==

Although Billy West stated in an interview that the name &quot;Philip&quot; was given to Fry by Matt Groening as a homage to the late Phil Hartman, for whom the role of Zapp Brannigan was created, Groening said during the 2013 Futurama panel at San Diego Comic-Con that Fry was in fact named after Groening&#x27;s father, Homer Philip Groening, who was also the namesake for Homer Simpson.

According to Groening, Fry&#x27;s character developed over time while still keeping his qualities as a loser and the characteristics which writers hoped would make him appeal to the target young male audience. Fry&#x27;s character is essentially a bungling, stubborn slob with a heart of gold who cannot get ahead in the world, but still has a slight glimmer of hope. Fry&#x27;s trademark outfit – a red windbreaker jacket, white t-shirt and blue jeans – is based on James Dean&#x27;s outfit from &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;.

Fry is voiced by Billy West, who also voices Doctor Zoidberg, Hubert J. Farnsworth and various other characters in the series. Although West auditioned for the part, it was originally given to Charlie Schlatter; however, after a casting change, West was offered the job. The voice West uses for Fry has been described as that of a &quot;generic Saturday-morning good guy&quot;. Other actors who auditioned for Fry include Ryan Stiles and Rob Paulsen. West admits that he intentionally made Fry&#x27;s sound similar to his own, claiming that keeping the &quot;cartoony&quot; aspects out of it would make it harder for someone else to imitate the same voice. He notes that the voice is higher than his own and that he tried to duplicate the voice he had at age 25, which he describes as &quot;this whiny, complaining voice — this plain vanilla voice&quot;. West also voices Lars Fillmore in &quot;&quot;, who is a time travel duplicate of Fry with an injured larynx, and therefore, a slightly altered voice. The producers initially considered having a different voice actor do Lars&#x27; voice in order to keep viewers from guessing his true identity, but ultimately decided it would not make sense if anyone besides West did the voice.

<text>Abruka () is a village in Estonia, primarily composed of the island of Abruka in the Gulf of Riga, 4 km south of the island of Saaremaa. The village includes the smaller adjacent islands of Vahase, Kasselaid, Linnusitamaa and Kirjurahu, resulting in a total area of .

Abruka is part of Saaremaa Parish, Saare County. The village has a population of 33 (as of 1 January 2011).

The first records about the population on Abruka originate from the Middle Ages, when the area was ruled by the Prussian State of the Teutonic Order; the Bishop of Ösel-Wiek founded a horse breeding manor on the largest island, named Abro in the Teutonic Order&#x27;s Low German language. Permanent population developed in the 18th century. From 1881–1972, an elementary school operated on Abruka.

Abruka is the site of a Central European-type broadleaf forest, which is rare in the region. To protect this a nature reserve was created in 1937.

There&#x27;s a library (located in the harbour building) and a museum which is located on the side of the former manor park in the oldest building on Abruka (The Abruka House).

Abruka can be reached by postboat &quot;Heili&quot; from Roomassaare harbour in Kuressaare.

The twin writers Jüri Tuulik and Ülo Tuulik (born 1940) were born on Abruka.

<text>Aegna is an Estonian island in the Bay of Tallinn in the Baltic Sea. Administratively it is part of the city of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia and is a sub district of the Kesklinn (City center) district.

==Geography==
Aegna island has an area of 3 km2, and can be found off the Viimsi peninsula, around 1.5 km NW of Rohuneeme and 14 km north of Tallinn. It has a 10 km coastline which includes two sandy beaches. The island&#x27;s highest point is about 13 m above sea level.

, Aegna had 16 permanent residents.

==Attractions==
Aegna is a popular destination for day and camping trips, and has around 15 km of walking routes. There is also a WDS Aegna Meditation and Development Centre, opened in the summer time. On the island stands the Eerikukivi, a glacial erratic declared &quot; Protected Natural Monument&quot;.

==History==
Aegna&#x27;s history dates back thousands of years, but the first written accounts of the island go back to 1297, when Danish king Erik Menved prohibited forestry on the islands of Naissaar and Aegna. Northern Estonia or Estland was also part of Denmark over a century, including Aegna. Historically, the population of Aegna has been mixed with predominantly Estonian and Swedish inhabitants. Inhabitants of the island were mostly fishermen.

Aegna has been used for military purposes during the Imperial Russia, Republic of Estonia and Soviet occupation time of Estonia. Military remains that can still be seen include those of a military watchtower, a large gun battery with tunnels, and the light railway used in its construction.

On 10 August 2005 a Copterline helicopter on Tallinn–Helsinki route crashed 3 km south of the island. All 14 people on the helicopter died.

==Transport==
The small ferry Juku operates to and from the island during the summer months, with support from the city of Tallinn. In the summer of 2010 the Juku was operated by Kihnu Veeteed

During the summer Tallinn-Cruises operate sightseeing tours to the island using the boat &quot;Monica&quot; 

The island can also be reached by boats or yachts chartered from Pirita Harbour 

In 2022 a new ferry was introduced, reducing the journey time to Aegna to 30 minutes. The &quot;Vegtind&quot; can accommodate 100 passengers and 20 bicycles, and is operated by the company Spinnaker.

===Port===

The Port of Aegna (port code EE AEN, ) is a seaport situated on the southern coast of Aegna.

<doc id="379657" wikidata="Q1053900" url="?curid=379657" title="Central League">
<text>The or , also known as the for sponsorship reasons, is one of the two professional baseball leagues that constitute Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan. The winner of the league championship plays against the winner of the Pacific League in the annual Japan Series. It currently consists of six teams from around the country. Unlike the Pacific League, designated hitters are not used during Central League home games.

== History ==
The Central League was founded in 1949 with eight teams: four holdovers from the previous Japanese Baseball League — the Chunichi Dragons, the Hanshin Tigers, the Yomiuri Giants, and the Shochiku Robins (formerly the Taiyō Robins) — and four new teams — the Hiroshima Carp, the Kokutetsu Swallows, the Nishi Nippon Pirates, and the Taiyō Whales.

The Nishi Nippon Pirates existed for one season — they placed sixth in 1950, and the following season merged with the also Fukuoka-based Nishitetsu Clippers (a member of the Pacific League) to form the Nishitetsu Lions, who joined the Pacific League. This brought the number of Central League teams down to an ungainly arrangement of seven.

Ryuji Suzuki became president of the Central League in 1952.

In 1952, it was decided that any team ending the season with a winning percentage below .300 would be disbanded or merged with other teams. The Shochiku Robins fell into this category, and were merged with the Taiyō Whales to become the Taiyō Shochiku Robins in January 1953. This enabled the Central League to shrink to an even number of six teams.

Ryuji Suzuki retired as CL president in 1984 after 33 years at the post.

In 2007, a new Climax Series was introduced. This playoff series was inspired by the stepladder playoff used in the Pacific League introduced in 2004 for the top three teams of the league to determine which one progressed to the Japan Series. Under the previous system, there was no post-season playoff and the winner of the pennant automatically qualified for the Japan Series.

<text>The , or , or the , due to sponsorship reasons, is one of the two professional baseball leagues constituting Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan. The winner of the league championship competes against the winner in the Central League for the annual Japan Series. It currently consists of six teams from around Japan.

== History ==
The circuit was founded as the Taiheiyo Baseball Union (太平洋野球連盟, &quot;Taiheiyo Yakyu Renmei&quot;) in 1949 (the name changing to its current form in 1980). Daiei Stars owner Masaichi Nagata was the first president of the Pacific League.

The league began with seven teams: four holdovers from the previous iteration, the Japanese Baseball League—the Hankyu Braves, the Nankai Hawks, the Daiei Stars, and the Tokyu Flyers—and three new teams—the Kintetsu Pearls, the Mainichi Orions, and the Nishitetsu Clippers.

In 1954, an eighth Pacific League team was founded, the Takahashi Unions, to increase the number of teams to eight. Although the team was stocked with players from the other Pacific League teams, the Unions struggled from the outset and finished in the second division every season. In 1957, the Unions were merged with the Daiei Stars to form the Daiei Unions (and again bringing the number of Pacific League teams down to seven). In their first season, the Unions finished in last place, games out of first. In 1958, the Unions merged with the Mainichi Orions to form the Daimai Orions. This enabled the Pacific League to shrink from the ungainly seven-team arrangement to six teams.

Fujio Nakazawa, a former player and television commentator, became the PL&#x27;s first full-time president in 1959, serving through 1965.

From 1973 to 1982, the Pacific League employed a split season, with the first-half winner playing against the second-half winner in a mini-playoff to determine its champion.

Beginning in 1975, the Pacific League began using the designated hitter (DH), as in the American League in Major League Baseball. During interleague play (adopted in 2005), the DH is used in Pacific League teams&#x27; home games.

After the 2004 Nippon Professional Baseball season and, the Orix BlueWave and the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes merged to form the Orix Buffaloes. A franchise was granted to internet shopping company Rakuten and the city of Sendai, forming the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles to fill the void caused by the merger.

Also since 2004, a three-team playoff system was introduced in the Pacific League (Pacific League Championship Series). The teams with the second- and third-best records play in the three-game first stage, with the winner advancing to a best-of-six final against the top team (the Pacific League pennant winner is granted a 1 game advantage in the Final Stage). The winner becomes the representative of the Pacific League to the Japan Series.

Since the Pacific League won every Japan Series after introducing this system, an identical system was introduced to the Central League in 2007, and the post-season intra-league games were renamed the &quot;Climax Series&quot; in both leagues. Player statistics and drafting order based on team records are not affected by these postseason games.

<text>Hector Guimard (, 10 March 1867 – 20 May 1942) was a French architect and designer, and a prominent figure of the Art Nouveau style. He achieved early fame with his design for the Castel Beranger, the first Art Nouveau apartment building in Paris, which was selected in an 1899 competition as one of the best new building facades in the city. He is best known for the glass and iron &quot;edicules&quot; or canopies, with ornamental Art Nouveau curves, which he designed to cover the entrances of the first stations of the Paris Metro.

Between 1890 and 1930, Guimard designed and built some fifty buildings, in addition to one hundred and forty-one subway entrances for Paris Metro, as well as numerous pieces of furniture and other decorative works. However, in the 1910s Art Nouveau went out of fashion and by the 1960s most of his works had been demolished, and only two of his original Metro edicules were still in place. Guimard&#x27;s critical reputation revived in the 1960s, in part due to subsequent acquisitions of his work by Museum of Modern Art, and art historians have noted the originality and importance of his architectural and decorative works. Guimard was a disciple of Viollet le Duc.

== Early life and education ==
Hector Guimard was born in Lyon on 10 March 1867. His father, Germain-René Guimard, was an orthopedist, and his mother, Marie-Françoise Bailly, was a linen maid. His parents married on 22 June 1867. His father became a gymnastics teacher at the Lycée Michelet in Vanves in 1878, and the following year Hector began to study at the Lycée. In October 1882 he enrolled at the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs, or school of decorative arts. He received his diploma on 17 March 1887, and promptly enrolled in the École des Beaux-Arts, where he studied architecture. He received honorable mention in several architectural competitions, and also showed his paintings at the Paris Salon des Artistes in 1890, and in 1892 competed, without success, in the competition for the Prix de Rome. In October 1891 he began to teach drawing and perspective to young women at the École nationale des arts decoratifs and later a course on perspective for younger students, a post he held until July 1900.

He showed his work at the Paris Salons of April 1894 and 1895, which earned him a prize of a funded voyage first to England and Scotland, and then, in the summer of 1895, to the Netherlands and Belgium. In Brussels in the summer of 1895, he met the Belgian architect Victor Horta, one of the founders of Art Nouveau, and saw the sinuous vegetal and floral lines of the Hotel Tassel, one of the earliest Art Nouveau houses. Guimard arranged for Horta to have an exhibition of his designs at the January 1896 Paris Salon, and Guimard&#x27;s own style and career began to change.

== Early career (1888–1899) ==
=== Early works ===
The earliest constructed work of Guimard was the cafe-restaurant &quot;Au Grand Neptune&quot; (1888), located on the Quai Auteuil in Paris at the edge of the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889. It was picturesque but not strikingly innovative. It was demolished in 1910. He constructed another picturesque structure for the Exposition, the Pavilion of Electricity, a showcase for the work of electrical engineer Ferdinand de Boyéres. Between 1889 and 1895 he constructed a dozen apartment buildings, villas and houses, mostly in the Paris 16th arrondissement or suburbs, including the Hotel Roszé (1891) and the Hotel Jassedé (1893) without attracting much attention. He earned his living primarily from his teaching at the School of Decorative Arts.

=== The Castel Béranger (1895–1899) ===
Guimard&#x27;s first recognized major work was the Castel Béranger in Paris, an apartment building with thirty-six units constructed between 1895 and 1898, when the architect was just thirty years old. It was at 14, rue Jean de la Fontaine, Paris, for Mme. Fournier. He persuaded his client to abandon a more restrained design and replace it with a new design in a more modern style, similar to that of Horta&#x27;s Hotel Tassel, which he had visited in the summer of 1895. Guimard put together an extraordinary number of stylistic effects and theatrical elements on the facade and in the interior, using cast iron, glass and ceramics for decoration. The lobby, decorated with sinuous vine-like cast iron and colorful ceramics, resembled an undersea grotto. He designed every detail, including the wallpaper, rain spouts and door handles, and added adding highly modern new features including a telephone booth in the lobby.

A skilled publicist, Guimard very effectively used the new building to advertise his work. He had his own apartment and office in the building. He organized conferences and press articles, set up an exhibition of his drawings in the salons of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, and wrote a monograph on the building. In 1899 he entered it into the first Paris competition for the best new building facades, and in March 1899 it was selected one of the six winners, a fact which he proudly had inscribed on the facade of the building.

== Mature career (1898–1914) ==
=== Castels, villas and a short-lived concert hall ===
The success and publicity created by the Castel Beranger quickly brought him commissions for other residential buildings. Between 1898 and 1900, he constructed three houses simultaneously, each very different but recognizably in Guimard&#x27;s style. The first, the Maison Coilliot, was built for the ceramics manufacturer Louis Coilliot on rue de Fleurs in Lille, and served as his store, reception hall and residence. The facade was covered with plaques of green enamelled volcanic rock, and decorated with soaring arches, curling wrought iron, and Guimard&#x27;s characteristic asymmetric, organic doorways and windows.

The following year, 1899, while he continued to teach regularly at the school of decorative arts in Paris, and continued construction of the Maison Coilliot, he began three new houses; The Modern Castel or Villa Canivet in Garches was Guimard&#x27;s reinvention of a medieval castle. La Bluette in Hermanville-sur-Mer was Guimard&#x27;s update of traditional Norman architecture. and the Castel Henriette, in Sevres. The Castel Henriette was the most inventive. It was located on a small site, almost circular, and was crowned with a tall, slender watchtower. To create more open interior space, Guimard moved the stairwell to the side of the building. The interior was lit by large windows, and featured ensembles of furniture all designed by Guimard. The building had an unhappy history. The watchtower fell in 1903, apparently after being struck by lightning. Guimard was summoned back and redesigned the house, adding new balconies and terrace. However, by the 1960s, the building was considered out of fashion, and it was rarely occupied. It served as a movie set before it was finally demolished, despite appeals by preservationists. Some of the furniture is now found in museums.

In 1898, Guimard embarked upon another ambitious project, the construction of a concert hall, the Salle Humbert-de-Romans, located at 60 Rue Saint Didier (16th arrondissement). It was built as the centrepiece of a conservatory of Christian music intended for orphans, proposed by a priest of the Dominican order, Father Levy. Guimard made an ambitious and non-traditional plan using soaring levels of iron and glass, inspired by an early idea of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. An organ manufacturer, in consultation with Camille Saint-Saëns, donated a grand organ. The Salle was completed in 1901, but a scandal involving Father Levy and the orphans broke out. Father Levy was exiled by the Pope to Constantinople, the foundation was dissolved, and the concert hall was used only for meetings and conferences. It closed in 1904 and was demolished in 1905. The grand organ moved to the church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul in Clichy, where it can be found today.

=== Paris Metro entrances ===

The highly publicized debut of the Hotel Béranger quickly brought Guimard new projects, including villas, a Paris concert hall, and, most famously, entrances for the stations of the new Paris Metro, which was planned to open in 1900 in time for the Paris Universal Exposition. A new organization, the chemin de fer métropolitan de Paris (CFP, now RATP) was created in April 1899 to build and manage the system. They organized a competition for station entrance edicules, or canopies, and balustrades, or railings. This attracted twenty-one applicants. Guimard did not apply. The twenty-one original applicants proposed edicules built of masonry, in various historic and picturesque styles. These were ridiculed in the press as resembling newspaper stands, funeral monuments, or public toilets. Time was short, and Guimard presented sketches of his own idea for entrances made of iron and glass, which would be quicker and simpler to manufacture. He was given the commission on 12 January 1900, just a few months before the opening of the system.

To simplify the manufacture, Guimard made two designs of edicules, called Type A and B. Both were made of cast iron frames, with cream-colored walls and glass roofs to protect against rain. The A type was simpler and more cubic, while the B was rounded and more dynamic in form, and is sometimes compared with a dragonfly. Only two of the original A types were made and neither still exists. Only one B type, restored, remains in its original location, at Porte Dauphine.

Guimard also designed a simpler version, without a roof, with railings or balustrades of ornamental green-painted iron escutcheons and two high pylons with lamps and a &#x27;Métropolitain&#x27; sign. The pylons were in an abstract vegetal form he invented, not resembling any particular plant, and the lettering was in a unique which Guimard invented. These were the most common type.

From the beginning, Guimard&#x27;s Metro entrances were controversial. In 1904, after complaints that the new Guimard balustrade at the Opera station was not in harmony with the architecture of the Palais Garnier opera house, the Metro authorities dismantled the entrance and replaced it with a more classical model. Garnier was sarcastic in his response in the Paris &quot;La Press&quot; of Paris on 4 October 1904. &quot;Should we harmonise the station of Père-Lachaise with the cemetery by constructing an entrance in the form of a tomb? ... Should we have a dancer with her leg raised in front of the station at place Dame-Blanche, to harmonise with the Moulin-Rouge?&quot;

From the beginning, Guimard was also in conflict with the Metro authorities about his payments. The dispute was ended in 1903 with an agreement by which Guimard received payment, but gave up his models and manufacturing rights. Construction of new stations continued using his design without his participation. Between 1900 and 1913, a total of 167 entrances were installed, of which sixty-six still survive, mostly in locations different from their original placement.

=== Late villas ===
In the early years of the 20th century, Guimard&#x27;s popularity diminished and his earlier frenetic pace of production slowed down. His works shown at the 1903 Paris Exposition of residential architecture did not attract the attention of the Castel Beranger and other earlier work. He was supported largely by one wealthy client, Léon Nozal, and his friends. His works for this group included the La Sapiniere, a small beach house at Hermanville-sur-Mer, near his earlier La Bluette house; La Surprise, a villa at Cabourg; and the Castel Val at Auvers-sur-Oise. In Paris he constructed the Hotel Nozal on Rue Ranelagh for his friend; the Hotel Jassadé for Louis Jassadé on Avenue de Versailles; and the palatial Castel d&#x27;Orgeval, which was the centrepiece of a new residential development at Villemoisson-sur-Orge in the Paris suburbs.
=== The Hôtel Guimard ===
The most important work of this period is the Hotel Guimard, built in 1909 at 122 Avenue Mozart (XVIth arrondissement) in Paris, ten years after his first success with the Hotel Beranger. It was built following his marriage with Adeline Oppenheim, an American painter from a wealthy family. The land was purchased three months after the marriage, and in June 1910 Guimard was able to move the offices of his agency into the ground floor. The house was not occupied by the couple, however, for two more years, while the furniture he designed was manufactured. The house is located on a triangular lot, which proved particularly challenging for Guimard. He saved interior space by installing an inclined elevator rather than a stairway on the upper floors. The house was designed to show its functions on the facade; his wife could paint in one portion of the house, with large windows, while he worked in his bureau in another part of the house. It had a very large dining room and many tables, but no kitchen; it was apparently designed for working and entertaining. The house was later broken up into apartments, and the original room arrangements and furniture are gone.

=== Apartments, the Hôtel Mezzara and a synagogue ===
By the 1910s, Guimard was no longer the leader of Paris architectural fashion, but he continued to design and build residences, apartment buildings, and monuments. Between 1910 and 1911 he built Hôtel Mezzara for Paul Mezzara, experimenting with skylights. Another notable work of this period is the Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue at 10 Rue Pavé (IV arrondissement) in the Marais district. The synagogue, Guimard&#x27;s only religious building, is characterised by a narrow façade clad in white stone, whose surface curves and undulates while highlighting verticality. Like with his previous projects, Guimard designed the interiors as well, organising the spaces and creating original furnishings that matched the architectural motifs of the structure. The construction begun in 1913 with the inauguration taking place on 7 June 1914, just a few weeks before the beginning of the First World War.

== Late career (1914–1942) ==
=== World War I and post-war years ===
By the time the First World War began in August 1914, Art Nouveau was already out of fashion. The army and war economy took almost all available workers and building materials. Most of Guimard&#x27;s projects were shelved. and Guimard gave up his furniture workshop on Avenue Perrichont. He left Paris and to reside most of the war in a luxury hotel in Pau and Candes-Saint-Martin, where he wrote essays and pamphlets calling for an end to militarized society, and also, more practically, studying ideas standardized housing that could be constructed more quickly and less expensively, anticipating the need to reconstruct housing destroyed in the War. He received a dozen patents for his new inventions.

One of the rare completed buildings still standing from this period is the office building at 10 Rue de Bretagne, begun in 1914 but not completed until after the War in 1919. The Art Nouveau style was replaced by a more functional simplicity, where the reinforced concrete structure defined the exterior of the building. The postwar shortages of iron and other materials affected the style; there was little decoration of the facade, or entrance. He concentrated his attention on the parapets which gave the building a soaring, modern profile.

Just before the First World War he had created a firm, the Sociéte général de constructions modernes, with the intention of building standardized housing at a modest price. He returned to Paris and in 1921–22, and built a small house at 3 Square Jasmin (16th arrondissement) designed to be a model for a series of standard houses, but it was not duplicated. He was unable to keep up with the rapid changes in styles and methods, and his firm was finally dissolved in July 1925.

In 1925, he participated in the Paris Exposition of Decorative and Modern Arts, the Exposition which gave its name to Art Deco, with a proposed model of a town hall for a French village. He also designed and built a parking garage and several war memorials and funeral monuments. He continued to receive honors, particularly for his teaching at the École national des arts decoratifs. In February 1929 he was named a Chevalier in the French Legion d&#x27;honneur.

After the war, Art Deco emerged as the leading style of Parisian architecture. Guimard adapted to the new style and proved his originality and attention to the detail. His buildings display geometric decorative patterns, simplified columns emphasizing structural elements and rigid shapes; despite this they retain elements of his previous style: sinuous lines, vegetal-inspired ornaments and typical Art Nouveau iron railings.

=== The Guimard Building and final works ===
His next project, the Guimard Building, an apartment building at 18 Rue Henri Heine, Paris (XVI arrondissement, begun in 1926. is his last major project still standing. He made a skilful of different-colored brick and stone to create decorative designs on the facade, and added triangular sculpted windows on the roof level, and, in the interior. a very remarkable central stairway with curling iron railings and hexagonal windows of colored and clear glass bricks In 1928 he entered the building into the competition for the best Paris facades, the same competition that he had entered in 1898 with the Hôtel Beranger. He was a winner again, and was the first Paris architect to enter twice and to win twice. This building became his residence, though he was not able to move in until 1930.

Despite his success with the facade competition, his late work appeared old fashioned, particularly compared with the modernism of the Paris buildings of Robert Mallet-Stevens, Auguste Perret, and Le Corbusier. Between 1926 and 1930 he built several residential buildings in the same neighborhood as his home in the 16th arrondissement, which still exist. These include the Hôtel Houyvet, at 2 Villa Flore and 120 Avenue Mozart, built for the industrialist Michel Antoine Paul Houyhvet. His last recorded work was La Guimardière, an apartment building on Avenue Le Nôtre, Vaucresson in the Hauts-de-Seine suburb of Paris. It was completed in about 1930, but was demolished in March–April 1969.

As early as 1918, he took steps to assure that his work would be documented and would survive. He obtained space in the former orangerie of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where he deposited models of his buildings and hundreds of designs. In 1936 he donated a large collection of his designs to Alfred Barr, the director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1937, he received authorisation to put thirty cases of models in the cellars of the National Museum of Antiquities in Saint-Germaine-en-Laye.

Guimard served as a member of the jury judging architectural works at the 1937 Paris Exposition, where he could hardly miss the monumental pavilion of Nazi Germany and the threat it presented. His wife was Jewish, and he was alarmed by the approaching likelihood of war. In September 1938 he and his wife settled in New York City. He died on 20 May 1942 at the Hotel Adams on Fifth Avenue. He is buried in Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York, about 25 miles north of New York City.

== Obscurity and rediscovery ==
After the War, in June–July 1948, his widow returned to Paris to settle his affairs. She offered the Hotel Guimard as a site for a Guimard Museum first to the French state, then to the City of Paris, but both refused. Instead, she donated three rooms of Guimard&#x27;s furniture to three museums; the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon, the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris, and the Museum of the Petit Palais, where they are now displayed. She also donated a collection of three hundred designs and photographs to the Museum of Decorative Arts. These disappeared into various archives in the 1960s, but were relocated in 2015. His widow died on 26 October 1965 in New York. 

By the time of Guimard&#x27;s death, many of his buildings had already been demolished or remodeled beyond recognition. Most of his original Metro station edicules and balustrades had also been removed. The only full covering remaining at its original location at Porte Dauphine. However, many original architectural drawings by Guimard were stored in the Dept. of Drawings &amp; Archives at Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University in New York City, and in the archives of the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. 

The re-evaluation and rehabilitation of Guimard&#x27;s reputation began in the late 1960s. Portions of the Castel Beranger were declared of historic and artistic value in July 1965, and the entire building was protected in 1989. His reputation was given a major boost in 1970, when the Museum of Modern Art in New York hosted a large exhibition of his work, including drawings he had donated himself and one of his Metro Station edicules. Other museums followed. The thirty cases of models in the cellars of the National Museum of Antiquities in Saint-Germaine-en-Laye were rediscovered and some were put on display.

In 1978, all of Guimard&#x27;s surviving Metro entrances (Eighty-eight of the original one hundred sixty-seven put in place) were declared of historic value. The city donated a few originals, and several copies, to Chicago and other cities which desired them. Reconstructed original edicules are found at Abbesses and Châtelet.

Many of his buildings have been substantially modified, and there are no intact Guimard interiors which are open to the public, though suites of his furniture can be found in the Museum of Decorative Arts and the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris.

He is honoured in street names in the French towns of Châteauroux, Perpignan, Guilherand-Granges and Cournon-d&#x27;Auvergne, and by the rue Hector Guimard in Belleville, Paris.

== Furniture ==
Like other prominent Art Nouveau architects, Guimard also designed furniture and other interior decoration to harmonize with his buildings. It took him some time to find his own style in furniture. The furniture he designed for the Hotel Delfau (1894), which he put on display at an Exposition in 1895, was picturesque and ornate, with a sort of star motif, which seemed to have little connection with the architecture of the house. His early furniture sometimes featured had long looping arms and lateral shelves and levels for displays of objects. He apparently did not produce any furniture for the Hotel Beranger, other than a desk and chairs for his own studio there. In his early years he is known to have produced only two full sets of furniture, a dining room set for the Castel Henriette and a dining room for the Villa La Bluette.He also designed furnishings without any particular room in mind, as he did with watercolor designs for the Russian Princess Maria Tenisheva in 1903.

His furniture style began to change in about 1903. He found a workshop to make his furniture, and began using finer woods, particularly pear wood, with delicate colors. He simplified he plans, and eliminated the excessive number of arms and shelves. The most notable examples of his late style are pieces made for the Hôtel Nozal (since destroyed) and now in the Musée des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. Other examples of the late style are from the Hotel Guimard, now in the Petit Palais and the Musée des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, and Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon.

==The Guimard Style==
Much of the success of Guimard came from the small details of his designs, from door handles and balcony railings to type faces, which he crafted with special imagination and care. He invented his own style of lettering which appeared on his Metro entrances and his building plans. He insisted on calling his work &quot;Style Guimard&quot;, not Art Nouveau, and he was genius at publicizing it. He wrote numerous articles and gave interviews and lectures on his work, and printed a set of &quot;Style Guimard&quot; postcards with his pictures of his buildings, 
Guimard rejected the dominant academic Beaux-Arts style of there 1880s, calling it &quot;cold receptacle of various past styles in which the original spirit was no longer alive enough to dwell&quot;. His fellow students at the National School of Decorative Arts nicknamed him the &quot;Ravachol of architecture&quot;, after Ravachol, the Paris anarchist who bombed church buildings. Nonetheless, he was recognized for his designing skills; in 1884 he was awarded three bronze and two silver medals at the school for his work. In 1885 he received awards in all of the competitions at the school, including four bronze medallions, five silver, and the school&#x27;s Grande Prix d&#x27;Architecture.
Guimard&#x27;s early Art Nouveau work, particularly the Castel Beranger, as Guimard himself acknowledged, was strongly influenced by the work of the Belgian architect Victor Horta, especially the Hotel Tassel, which Guimard visited before he designed the Castel Beranger. Like Horta, he created original designs and ornament, inspired by his own views of nature. If the skylights favored by Victor Horta are rare in his work (the Mezzara Hotel, 1910, and the Rue Pavée Synagogue, (1913), being notable exceptions), Guimard made noteworthy experiments in space and volume. These include the Coilliot House and its disconcerting double-frontage (1898), and the Villa La Bluette, noted for its volumetric harmony (1898), and especially the Castel Henriette (1899) and the Castel d&#x27;Orgeval (1905), demonstrations of an asymmetrical &quot;free plan&quot;, twenty-five years before the theories of Le Corbusier. Other buildings of his, like the Hôtel Nozal (1905), employ a rational, symmetrical, square-based style inspired by Viollet-le-Duc.

Guimard employed some structural innovations, as in the concert hall Humbert-de-Romans (1901), where he created a complex frame to divide sound waves to produce enhanced acoustics (built 1898 and demolished in 1905), or as in the Hôtel Guimard (1909), where the ground was too narrow to have the exterior walls bear any weight, and thus the arrangement of interior spaces differs from one floor to another.
In addition to his architecture, furniture, and wrought iron work, Guimard also designed art objects, such as vases, some of which were produced by the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres outside Paris. A notable example is the Vase of Binelles (1902), made by crystallization on hard porcelain, which is now in the National Museum of Ceramics in Sèvres.

Guimard was a determined advocate of architectural standardization, from mass-producing Metro station edicules and balustrades to (less successfully) the mass production of cast iron pieces and other prefabricated building materials intended for the assembly rows of houses. entrances to the Paris Métro, based on the ornamented structures of Viollet-le-Duc. The idea was taken up – but with less success – in 1907 with a catalogue of cast iron elements applicable to buildings: &quot;Artistic Cast Iron, Guimard Style&quot;. Guimard&#x27;s art objects have the same formal continuity as his buildings, harmoniously uniting practical function with linear design, as in the &quot;Vase des Binelles&quot;, of 1903.
His stylistic vocabulary has suggestions to plants and organic matter and has been described as a form of &quot;abstract naturalism&quot;. Undulating and coagulating forms are found in every material from stone, wood, cast iron, glass (Mezzara hotel, 1910), fabric (Guimard hotel, 1909), paper (Castel Béranger, 1898), wrought iron (Castel Henriette, 1899), and ceramic (Coilliot House, 1898); Guimard compared it analogously to the flowing of sap running from a tree, referring to the liquid quality found in his work as the &quot;sap of things&quot;. Guimard&#x27;s structural forms remain only as abstract evocations of nature and never directly indicative of any particular plant, an approached outlined by the art critic and contemporary, Gustave Soulier who said about Guimard&#x27;s work: &quot;we do not see... clearly recognisable motifs which are only interpreted and regularised by a geometric ornamental convention. But neither is it merely withered and graceless floral or animal skeletons that Mr. Guimard draws. He is inspired by the underlying movements, by the creative process in nature that reveals to us identical formulas through its numerous manifestations. And he assimilates these principles in the formation of his ornamental contours... the floret is not an exact representation of any particular flower, Here is an art that both abbreviates and amplifies the immediate facts of Nature; it spiritualises them. We are present at the birth of the quintessence of a flower.&quot;

<doc id="379667" wikidata="Q2069643" url="?curid=379667" title="Stage diving">
<text>Stage diving is the act of leaping from a concert stage onto the crowd below, which occasionally causes serious injuries. It is often the precursor to crowd surfing.

Long before the word was invented, public stagediving took place during the first Dutch concert by The Rolling Stones at the Kurhaus of Scheveningen on August 8, 1964.

Many musicians have made stage diving a part of their stage act. Jim Morrison was an early performer known for having jumped into the crowd at several concerts. Iggy Pop is often credited with popularising stage diving in popular rock music. Initially seen as confrontational and extreme, stage diving has become common at hardcore punk and thrash metal performances.

==Risks and incidents==
Stage diving has occasionally caused serious injuries. One example is when Peter Gabriel of Genesis at the Friars club in Aylesbury on 19 June 1971 stage dove during the end of their song &quot;The Knife&quot;, landing on his foot and breaking his ankle. 

On 20 August 2010, Charles Haddon, the lead singer of English synthpop band Où Est Le Swimming Pool, died by suicide after a performance at Pukkelpop, Belgium, by jumping from a telecommunications mast in the backstage artists&#x27; parking area. Haddon was reported to have been distressed after he feared he had seriously injured a young girl earlier after a stagedive.

In February 2014, federal judge Jan E. DuBois ruled that Fishbone had to pay $1.4 million to a woman who broke her skull and collarbone during a 2010 concert in Philadelphia when Angelo Moore stage-dove and landed on top of her.

Another fatal stage diving incident occurred in May 2014 in New York City during a performance of the metalcore band Miss May I. Although the fan was able to walk away after falling from the stage, the concert was cut short after he fainted. He later died at the hospital.

<text>Funker Vogt () is a German electronic-industrial music project with an aggressive style, formed by vocalist Jens Kästel and programmer Gerrit Thomas in 1995. Other members of the band are keyboardist/manager Björn Böttcher, live guitarist Frank Schweigert and lyricist Kai Schmidt. The name of the band translates from German to English as &quot;Radio Operator Vogt&quot;, this being the surname of a friend of the band who was a military radio operator.

The band ceased in the summer of 2021 due to the termination of cooperation with Chris L. 

On January 1 2023 Funker Vogt announced that they would return.

==History==
The group appeared on several German compilations and, in 1996, released their debut album &quot;Thanks for Nothing&quot;. Following the release of two limited edition EPs (&quot;Words of Power&quot; and &quot;Take Care&quot;), Funker Vogt signed with the American record label Metropolis Records. Metropolis re-released &quot;Thanks for Nothing&quot;, followed by the &quot;We Came to Kill&quot; in late 1997. Kästel and Thomas have participated, as remixers, on Leæther Strip album &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m Limited, Vol. 2&quot;. In 2000, Funker Vogt released &quot;Maschine Zeit&quot;, followed by the remix EP &quot;T&quot; in early 2001. Additionally to the core members of the band, concert members also include Björn Böttcher (keyboard) and Frank Schweigert (guitar, he replaced Thomas Kroll in 2004). Kai Schmidt writes most of the lyrics and manages the band through his own management company. They all hail from the town of Hamelin in Germany. The majority of their lyrics revolve around the concepts of war.

A distinctive theme is present in the band&#x27;s work and stage presence; both their musicianship and their costuming are strongly reminiscent of military music and dress. This military aesthetic is also popular with the band&#x27;s fanbase. However, the political stance of Funker Vogt is decidedly anti-war; the band cites &quot;war and social injustice&quot; as their primary topics of discussion, noting that the goal of the album &quot;Execution Tracks&quot;, along with the accompanying video, was to &quot;present the grotesque cruelties and the tragedy of war.&quot;

According to the band&#x27;s website, as of 2011 both Björn Böttcher and Kai Schmidt are no longer collaborating with the band. As a result, Funker Vogt will no longer be managed by REPOMANagement. In 2013, longtime frontman Jens Kästel left the band after his last show on 30 November in Berlin. Four years later in 2017 Funker Vogt reformed with a new singer, Chris L. (Agonoize/The Sexorcist).

<text>The Japan Series ( , officially the Japan Championship Series, ), also the Nippon Series, is the annual championship series in Nippon Professional Baseball, the top baseball league in Japan. It is a best-of-seven series between the winning clubs of the league&#x27;s two circuits, the Central League and the Pacific League, and is played in October or November. The first team to win four games is the overall winner and is declared each year. The Japan Series uses a 2–3–3-3 format, with the latter four games in theory if additional games are needed following tiebreakers.

The home team for games 1, 2 and eventually 6 and 7, alternates between the two leagues with the Pacific League having the advantage on the years ending with an odd number and the Central League on the years ending with an even number. Designated hitters are used if the team from the Pacific League hosts the game. There is a 40-man postseason roster limit, and the rule on drawn games is changed to 12 innings, since 2018. If the series is tied after the seventh game, a Game 8 will be held with the same team hosting Games 6 and 7 hosting this game. Only once a Game 8 has been played in Japan Series history, where the Seibu Lions defeated the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in 1986. In the event that Game 8 does not decide the series, the next game would be played at the stadium that hosted Games 3 through 5 after a day of rest, and games will continue until one team wins four games.

Every current team in the NPB has won the Japan Series at least once. The team with the most championships is the Yomiuri Giants, who have won the Japan Series twenty-two times. In 2004, the Pacific League instituted a three-team stepladder playoff format to determine the league champion, while the Central League champion had a long wait before the Japan Series. During this time, the Pacific League won four consecutive Series from 2003 to 2006. Starting with the 2007 postseason, both leagues adopted the Climax Series to determine their champions. The Climax Series involves the top three finishers in each league, though the format gives a significant advantage to the team with the best record in each league.

On November 6, 2010, the Chunichi Dragons and Chiba Lotte Marines played the longest game in Japan Series history. It lasted fifteen innings and resulted in a 2–2 draw, with the game lasting 5 hours and 43 minutes. Only Game 2 of the 2022 Japan Series on October 23, 2022, came close, with the Orix Buffaloes and Tokyo Yakult Swallows playing to a 3–3 draw after 12 innings, lasting 5 hours and 3 minutes.

Even though the Central League is historically more victorious, in recent years, the Pacific League has been catching up in titles. Currently, the Central League has 38 titles, while the Pacific League has 37 titles. The Pacific League won eight consecutive Japan Series championships from 2013 to 2020, with six by the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, and one each by the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters and Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. The streak was broken in 2021, with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows beating the Orix Buffaloes.

==List of winners==

Kazuhisa Inao, as an exception, won the Fighting Spirit Award (in 1956) while playing for the victorious Nishitetsu Lions.

===Extra inning rules===
Since 2018, there is a limit of 12 innings in the seven regulation games, with games being called tie games if tied after that time. From 1987 to 2020, the innings limit is abolished starting in extra games (Game 8, et al) if necessary. Since 2021, extra games are played to 12 innings as normal. Starting in the 13th inning of extra games, the World Baseball Softball Confederation two-runner tiebreaker with runners at first and second base, similar to the Japanese High School Baseball Championship (Koshien), will be implemented.

Historically:
* Until 1966 (except 1964): Game is called at sunset (all games were played as day games)
** 1964 (all games at night): No new inning may start after 10:30 p.m.
* 1967–1981: No new inning may start after 5:30 p.m.
* 1982–1986: No new inning may start after the game time reaches four-and-a-half hours
* 1987–1993: 18-inning limit until Game 7, unlimited innings Game 8 and onward (change introduced due to Game 8 being necessary in the 1986 series due to Game 1 being called after 14 innings)
* 1994: 18- (day game) / 15-inning (night game) limit until Game 7, unlimited innings Game 8 and onward
* 1995–2017: / 15-inning limit until Game 7, unlimited innings Game 8 and onward
** The three-and-a-half hour cut-off rule used in the 2011 regular season was not used for the Japan Series.
* 2018–2020: 12-inning limit until Game 7, unlimited innings Game 8 and onward
* 2021–present: 12-inning limit. Starting in Game 8, further innings played use WBSC two-runner tiebreaker.

* The Yomiuri Giants also won five consecutive Central League pennants from 1955 to 1959, and 19 of the 23 Central League pennants from 1951 to 1973. The Giants also won two or three consecutive Central League pennants on several other occasions. The other teams to win consecutive Central League pennants are the Hiroshima Toyo Carp (1979–1980 and 2016–2018), the Yakult Swallows (1992–1993 and 2021–2022), and the Chunichi Dragons (2006–2007 and 2010–2011).

<doc id="379671" wikidata="Q1137974" url="?curid=379671" title="The C Programming Language">
<text>The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&amp;R, after its authors&#x27; initials) is a computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the C programming language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely intertwined. The book was central to the development and popularization of C and is still widely read and used today. Because the book was co-authored by the original language designer, and because the first edition of the book served for many years as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for the language, the book was regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on C.

== History ==
C was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s as an augmented version of Ken Thompson&#x27;s B.
Another Bell Labs employee, Brian Kernighan, had written the first C tutorial,
and he persuaded Ritchie to coauthor a book on the language.
Kernighan would write most of the book&#x27;s &quot;expository&quot; material, and Ritchie&#x27;s reference manual became its appendices.

The first edition, published February 22, 1978, was the first widely available book on the C programming language. Its version of C is sometimes termed &quot;K&amp;R C&quot; (after the book&#x27;s authors), often to distinguish this early version from the later version of C standardized as ANSI C.

In April 1988, the second edition of the book was published, updated to cover the changes to the language resulting from the then-new ANSI C standard, particularly with the inclusion of reference material on standard libraries. The second edition of the book (and , the most recent) has since been translated into over 20 languages. In 2012, an eBook version of the second edition was published in ePub, Mobi, and PDF formats.

C was first standardized in 1989 (as ANSI X3.159-1989) and has since undergone several revisions. However, no new edition of &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; has been issued to cover the more recent standards.

== Reception ==
&quot;Byte&quot; magazine stated in August 1983, &quot;[&quot;The C Programming Language&quot;] is the definitive work on the C language. Don&#x27;t read any further until you have this book!&quot; Jerry Pournelle wrote in the magazine that year that the book &quot;is still the standard ... a bit terse&quot;. He continued, &quot;You can learn the C language without getting Kernighan and Ritchie, but that&#x27;s doing it the hard way. You&#x27;re also working too hard if you make it the &quot;only&quot; book on C that you buy.&quot;

== Influence ==
&quot;The C Programming Language&quot; has often been cited as a model for technical writing, with reviewers describing it as having clear presentation and concise treatment. Examples generally consist of complete programs of the type one is likely to encounter in daily use of the language, with an emphasis on system programming. Its authors wrote,

The book introduced the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program, which prints only the text &quot;hello, world&quot; as an illustration of a minimal working C program. Since then, many texts have followed that convention for introducing a programming language.

Before the advent of ANSI C, the first edition of the text served as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard of the language for writers of C compilers. With the standardization of ANSI C, the authors more consciously wrote the second edition for programmers rather than compiler writers, writing,

The influence of &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; on programmers, a generation of whom first worked with C in universities and industry, has led many to accept the authors&#x27; programming style and conventions as recommended practice, if not normative practice. For example, the coding and formatting style of the programs presented in both editions of the book is often referred to as &quot;K&amp;R style&quot; or the &quot;One True Brace Style&quot; and became the coding style used by convention in the source code for the Unix and Linux kernels.

<text>Crowd surfing is the process in which a person is passed overhead from person to person (often during a concert). The &quot;crowd surfer&quot; is passed above everyone&#x27;s heads, with everyone&#x27;s hands supporting the person&#x27;s weight.

==Origins==
Iggy Pop leapt into the crowd at the 1970 Cincinnati Summer Pop Festival, an early example of crowd surfing.

In early 1980 Peter Gabriel crowd surfed during performances of &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; by falling into his audience &quot;crucifix style&quot; and then being passed around. The rear sleeve of his 1983 album &quot;Plays Live&quot;, recorded during Gabriel&#x27;s 1982 tour, features a photograph of him crowd surfing.

Said Gabriel:

The first official video release to depict Gabriel crowd surfing was &quot;POV&quot;, a concert video released in 1990 and produced by Martin Scorsese. When Billy Joel crowdsurfed in a concert during his 1987 concert tour of the Soviet Union, bandmate Kevin Dukes described it as the &quot;Peter Gabriel flop&quot;.

Crowd surfing extended for the first time to the classical music scene, when in June 2014 at the Bristol Proms an audience-member was ejected by fellow audience members during a performance of Handel&#x27;s Messiah after he took the director&#x27;s invitation to &quot;clap and whoop&quot; to the music a step too far by attempting to crowd-surf.

<text>A political family (also referred to as political dynasty) is a family in which multiple members are involved in politics — particularly electoral politics. Members may be related by blood or marriage; often several generations or multiple siblings may be involved.

A royal family or dynasty in a monarchy is generally considered to not be a &quot;political family,&quot; although the later descendants of a royal family have played political roles in a republic (such as the Arslan family of Lebanon). A family dictatorship is a form of hereditary dictatorship that operates much like an absolute monarchy, yet occurs in a nominally non-monarchic state.

==United States==

In the United States, many political families (having at least two generations serving in political office) have arisen since the country&#x27;s founding.

<text>Damietta ( &quot;&quot; ; ) is a port city and the capital of the Damietta Governorate in Egypt. It is located at the Damietta branch, an eastern distributary of the Nile Delta, from the Mediterranean Sea, and about north of Cairo. It was a Catholic bishopric and is a multiple titular see. It is also a member of the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities.

== Etymology ==
The modern name of the city comes from its Coptic name Tamiati ( ), which in turn most likely comes from Ancient Egyptian d-mi-i-N21:Z1 (, &quot;mooring, port, town&quot;) and t:O49 (), a determinative used for towns and cities, although al-Maqrizi suggested a Syriac etymology.

== History ==
Mentioned by the 6th-century geographer Stephanus of Byzantium, the city was called &quot;Tamíathis&quot; () in the Hellenistic period.

Under the Rashid caliph Umar (579–644), the Arabs took the city and successfully resisted the attempts by the Byzantine Empire to recover it, especially in 739, 821, 921 and 968. The Abbasid Caliphate used Alexandria, Damietta, Aden and Siraf as entry ports to India and Tang China. Damietta was an important naval base during the Abbasid, Tulunid and Fatimid periods. This led to several attacks by the Byzantine Empire, most notably the sack and destruction of the city in May 853.

Damietta was again important in the 12th and 13th centuries during the Crusades. In 1169, a fleet from the Kingdom of Jerusalem, with support from the Byzantine Empire, attacked the port, but the besiegers returned home without any success to capture the port, which was defended by Saladin.

During preparations for the Fifth Crusade in 1217, it was decided that Damietta should be the focus of attack. Control of Damietta meant control of the Nile, and from there the Crusaders believed they could conquer Egypt. From Egypt, they could then attack Ayyubid-ruled Palestine and recapture Jerusalem. After the siege of Damietta of 1218–19, the port was occupied by the Crusaders. The siege devastated the population of Damietta. After the crusaders captured Damietta in November 1219, they looted the city.

Earlier that year, Francis of Assisi had arrived to negotiate with the Muslim ruler peaceably. In 1221 the Crusaders attempted to march to Cairo, but were destroyed by the combination of nature and Muslim defenses.

Damietta was also the object of the Seventh Crusade, led by Louis IX of France. His fleet arrived there in 1249 and quickly captured the fort, which he refused to hand over to the nominal king of Jerusalem, to whom it had been promised during the Fifth Crusade. However, having been taken prisoner with his army in April 1250, Louis was obliged to surrender Damietta as ransom.

Hearing that Louis was preparing a new crusade, the Mamluk sultan Baybars – given the importance of the city to the Crusaders – destroyed it in 1251 and rebuilt it with stronger fortifications a few kilometers from the Nile in the early 1260s, making the mouth of the Damietta branch impassable for ships.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Hellenistic Tamiathis became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Pelusium, the capital of the Roman province of Augustamnica Prima, to which Tamiathis belonged. Its bishop Heraclius took part in the Council of Ephesus in 431. Helpidius was a signatory of the decree of Patriarch Gennadius of Constantinople against simony in 459. Bassus was at the Second Council of Constantinople (553). In a letter from Patriarch Michael I of Alexandria read at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879), mention is made of Zacharias of Tamiathis, who had attended a synod that Michael had convened in support of Photius. Later bishops too of Tamiathis are named in other documents.
In 1249, when Louis IX of France captured the city, it became for a short time the seat of a Latin Church bishop.
The Latin bishopric, no longer residential, is today listed by the Catholic Church twice as a titular see under the names Tamiathis (Latin) and Damiata (Curiate Italian), each at time of episcopal or archiepiscopal rank, of the Latin and Melkite Catholic Churches, for the Catholic Church, having been until the early 20th century an important centre for that church.

=== Titular Latin see ===
The diocese was nominally restored in the 17th century when established as Latin titular archbishopric of Damietta of the Romans ( or ; ) and had the following incumbents of the intermediary archiepiscopal rank :
* Bernardino Spada (later Cardinal) (1623.12.04 – 1626.01.19)
* Cardinal Cesare Facchinetti (1639.09.05 – 1672.11.14)
* Neri Corsini (later Cardinal) (1652.08.12 – 1664.01.14)
* Angelo Maria Ranuzzi (later Cardinal) (1668.04.30 – 1678.04.18)

== Climate ==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh), but blowing winds from the Mediterranean Sea greatly moderate the temperatures, typical to the Egypt&#x27;s north coast, making its summers moderately hot and humid while its winters mild and moderately wet where sleet and hail are also common.

Port Said, Kosseir, Ras El Bar, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.

== Economy ==
Damietta is very famous for its furniture industry. In addition to the Egyptian market, its furniture is sold in Arab countries, Africa, Europe, the United States, and almost all over the world.
Today, there is a canal connecting it to the Nile, which has made it an important port once again. Containers are transported through the new Damietta Port. The Damietta governorate has a population of about 1,093,580 (2006). It contains the SEGAS LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) plant, which will ultimately have a capacity of 9.6 million ton/year through two trains. The plant is owned by Segas, a joint venture of the Spanish utility Unión Fenosa (40%), Italian oil company Eni (40%) and the Egyptian companies EGAS and EGPC (10% each). The plant is unusual since it is not supplied from a dedicated field, but is supplied with gas from the Egyptian grid. , EMethanex, the Egyptian division of Methanex Corporation, a Canadian owned company, was building a 3600 MTPD methanol plant. Damietta also has a woodworking industry and is also noted for its White Domiati cheese and other dairy products and Pâtisserie and Egyptian desserts. It is also a fishing port.

<text>Reader-response criticism is a school of literary theory that focuses on the reader (or &quot;audience&quot;) and their experience of a literary work, in contrast to other schools and theories that focus attention primarily on the author, content, or form of the work.

== Development ==
Although literary theory has long paid some attention to the reader&#x27;s role in creating the meaning and experience of a literary work, modern reader-response criticism began in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, particularly in the US and Germany. This movement shifted the focus from the text to the reader and argues that affective response is a legitimate point for departure in criticism. Its conceptualization of critical practice is distinguished from theories that favor textual autonomy (for example, Formalism and New Criticism) as well as recent critical movements (for example, structuralism, semiotics, and deconstruction) due to its focus on the reader&#x27;s interpretive activities.

Classic reader-response critics include Norman Holland, Stanley Fish, Wolfgang Iser, Hans-Robert Jauss, and Roland Barthes. Important predecessors were I. A. Richards, who in 1929 analyzed a group of Cambridge undergraduates&#x27; misreadings; and Louise Rosenblatt, who, in &quot;Literature as Exploration&quot; (1938), argued that it is important for the teacher to avoid imposing any &quot;preconceived notions about the proper way to react to any work&quot;.

Reader-response theory recognizes the reader as an active agent who imparts &quot;real existence&quot; to the work and completes its meaning through interpretation. Reader-response criticism argues that literature should be viewed as a performing art in which each reader creates their own, possibly unique, text-related performance. The approach avoids subjectivity or essentialism in descriptions produced through its recognition that reading is determined by textual and also cultural constraints. It stands in total opposition to the theories of formalism and the New Criticism, in which the reader&#x27;s role in re-creating literary works is ignored. New Criticism had emphasized that only that which is within a text is part of the meaning of a text. No appeal to the authority or intention of the author, nor to the psychology of the reader, was allowed in the discussions of orthodox New Critics.

==Types==
There are multiple approaches within the theoretical branch of reader-response criticism, yet all are unified in their belief that the meaning of a text is derived from the reader through the reading process. Lois Tyson classified the variations into five recognized reader-response criticism approaches whilst warning that categorizing reader-response theorists explicitly invites difficulty due to their overlapping beliefs and practices. Transactional reader-response theory, led by Louise Rosenblatt and supported by Wolfgang Iser, involves a transaction between the text&#x27;s inferred meaning and the individual interpretation by the reader influenced by their personal emotions and knowledge. Affective stylistics, established by Fish, believe that a text can only come into existence as it is read; therefore, a text cannot have meaning independent of the reader. Subjective reader-response theory, associated with David Bleich, looks entirely to the reader&#x27;s response for literary meaning as individual written responses to a text are then compared to other individual interpretations to find continuity of meaning. Psychological reader-response theory, employed by Norman Holland, believes that a reader&#x27;s motives heavily affect how they read, and subsequently use this reading to analyze the psychological response of the reader. Social reader-response theory is Stanley Fish&#x27;s extension of his earlier work, stating that any individual interpretation of a text is created in an interpretive community of minds consisting of participants who share a specific reading and interpretation strategy. In all interpretive communities, readers are predisposed to a particular form of interpretation as a consequence of strategies used at the time of reading.

An alternative way of organizing reader-response theorists is to separate them into three groups. The first involves those who focus upon the individual reader&#x27;s experience (&quot;individualists&quot;). Reader-response critics in the United States such as Holland and Bleich are characterized as individualists due to their use of psychology as starting point, focusing on the individual identity when processing a text. Then, there are the &quot;experimenter&quot; group, who conduct psychological experiments on a defined set of readers and those who assume a fairly uniform response by all readers called &quot;uniformists&quot;. The classifications show reader-response theorists who see the individual reader driving the whole experience and others who think of literary experience as largely text-driven and uniform (with individual variations that can be ignored). The former theorists, who think the reader controls, derive what is common in a literary experience from shared techniques for reading and interpreting which are, however, individually applied by different readers. The latter, who put the text in control, derive commonalities of response, obviously, from the literary work itself. The most fundamental difference among reader-response critics is probably, then, between those who regard individual differences among readers&#x27; responses as important and those who try to get around them.

===Individualists===
In the 1960s, David Bleich&#x27;s pedagogically inspired literary theory entailed that the text is the reader&#x27;s interpretation of it as it exists in their mind, and that an objective reading is not possible due to the symbolization and resymbolization process. The symbolization and resymbolization process consists of how an individual&#x27;s personal emotions, needs and life experiences affect how a reader engages with a text; marginally altering the meaning. Bleich supported his theory by conducting a study with his students in which they recorded their individual meaning of a text as they experienced it, then response to their own initial written response, before comparing it with other student&#x27;s responses to collectively establish literary significance according to the classes &quot;generated&quot; knowledge of how particular persons recreate texts. He used this knowledge to theorize about the reading process and to refocus the classroom teaching of literature.

Michael Steig and Walter Slatoff have, like Bleich, shown that students&#x27; highly personal responses can provide the basis for critical analyses in the classroom. Jeffrey Berman has encouraged students responding to texts to write anonymously and share with their classmates writings in response to literary works about sensitive subjects like drugs, suicidal thoughts, death in the family, parental abuse and the like. A kind of catharsis bordering on therapy results. In general, American reader-response critics have focused on individual readers&#x27; responses. American magazines like &quot;Reading Research Quarterly&quot; and others publish articles applying reader-response theory to the teaching of literature.

In 1961, C. S. Lewis published &quot;An Experiment in Criticism&quot;, in which he analyzed readers&#x27; role in selecting literature. He analyzed their selections in light of their goals in reading. As early as 1926, however, Lewis was already describing the reader-response principle when he maintained that &quot;a poem unread is not a poem at all&quot;. Modern reader-response critics have drawn from his idea that one cannot see the thing itself but only the image conjured in his mind as induced by stimulated sense perceptions.

In 1967, Stanley Fish published &quot;Surprised by Sin&quot;, the first study of a large literary work (&quot;Paradise Lost&quot;) that focused on its readers&#x27; experience. In an appendix, &quot;Literature in the Reader&quot;, Fish used &quot;the&quot; reader to examine responses to complex sentences sequentially, word-by-word. Since 1976, however, he has turned to real differences among real readers. He explores the reading tactics endorsed by different critical schools, by the literary professoriate, and by the legal profession, introducing the idea of &quot;interpretive communities&quot; that share particular modes of reading.

In 1968, Norman Holland drew on psychoanalytic psychology in &quot;The Dynamics of Literary Criticism&quot; to model the literary work. Each reader introjects a fantasy &quot;in&quot; the text, then modifies it by defense mechanisms into an interpretation. In 1973, however, having recorded responses from real readers, Holland found variations too great to fit this model in which responses are mostly alike but show minor individual variations.

Holland then developed a second model based on his case studies: &quot;5 Readers Reading&quot;. An individual has (in the brain) a core identity theme (behaviors then becoming understandable as a theme and variations as in music). This core gives that individual a certain style of being—and reading. Each reader uses the physical literary work plus invariable codes (such as the shapes of letters) plus variable canons (different &quot;interpretive communities&quot;, for example) plus an individual style of reading to build a response both like and unlike other readers&#x27; responses. Holland worked with others at the State University of New York at Buffalo, Murray Schwartz, David Willbern, and Robert Rogers, to develop a particular teaching format, the &quot;Delphi seminar,&quot; designed to get students to &quot;know themselves&quot;.

===Experimenters===
The type of reader-response critics who conduct psychological experiments on a defined set of readers are called experimenters. The experiments often involve participants free associating during the study, with the experimenters collecting and interpreting reader-responses in an informal way. Reuven Tsur in Israel has developed in great detail models for the expressivity of poetic rhythms, of metaphor, and of word-sound in poetry (including different actors&#x27; readings of a single line of Shakespeare). Richard Gerrig in the U.S. has experimented with the reader&#x27;s state of mind during and after a literary experience. He has shown how readers put aside ordinary knowledge and values while they read, treating, for example, criminals as heroes. He has also investigated how readers accept, while reading, improbable or fantastic things (Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot;), but discard them after they have finished.

In Canada, David Miall, usually working with Donald Kuiken, has produced a large body of work exploring emotional or &quot;affective&quot; responses to literature, drawing on such concepts from ordinary criticism as &quot;defamiliarization&quot; or &quot;foregrounding&quot;. They have used both experiments and new developments in neuropsychology, and have developed a questionnaire for measuring different aspects of a reader&#x27;s response.

There are many other experimental psychologists around the world exploring readers&#x27; responses, conducting many detailed experiments. One can research their work through their professional organizations, the International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature and Media , and International Association of Empirical Aesthetics, and through such psychological indices as PSYCINFO.

Two notable researchers are Dolf Zillmann and Peter Vorderer, both working in the field of communications and media psychology. Both have theorized and tested ideas about what produces emotions such as suspense, curiosity, surprise in readers, the necessary factors involved, and the role the reader plays. Jenefer Robinson, a philosopher, has recently blended her studies on emotion with its role in literature, music, and art.

===Uniformists===

Wolfgang Iser exemplifies the German tendency to theorize the reader and so posit a uniform response. For him, a literary work is not an object in itself but an effect to be explained. But he asserts this response is controlled by the text. For the &quot;real&quot; reader, he substitutes an implied reader, who is the reader a given literary work requires. Within various polarities created by the text, this &quot;implied&quot; reader makes expectations, meanings, and the unstated details of characters and settings through a &quot;wandering viewpoint&quot;. In his model, the text controls. The reader&#x27;s activities are confined within limits set by the literary work.

Two of Iser&#x27;s reading assumptions have influenced reading-response criticism of the New Testament. The first is the role of the reader, who is active, not passive, in the production of textual meaning. The reader fills in the &quot;gaps&quot; or areas of &quot;indeterminacy&quot; of the text. Although the &quot;text&quot; is written by the author, its &quot;realization&quot; (&quot;Konkritisation&quot;) as a &quot;work&quot; is fulfilled by the reader, according to Iser. Iser uses the analogy of two people gazing into the night sky to describe the role of the reader in the production of textual meaning. &quot;Both [may] be looking at the same collection of stars, but one will see the image of a plough, and the other will make out a dipper. The &#x27;stars&#x27; in a literary text are fixed, the lines that join them are variable.&quot; The Iserian reader contributes to the meaning of the text, but limits are placed on this reader by the text itself.

The second assumption concerns Iser&#x27;s reading strategy of anticipation of what lies ahead, frustration of those expectations, retrospection, and reconceptualization of new expectations. Iser describes the reader&#x27;s maneuvers in the negotiation of a text in the following way: &quot;We look forward, we look back, we decide, we change our decisions, we form expectations, we are shocked by their nonfulfillment, we question, we muse, we accept, we reject; this is the dynamic process of recreation.&quot;

Iser&#x27;s approach to reading has been adopted by several New Testament critics, including Culpepper 1983, Scott 1989, Roth 1997, Darr 1992, 1998, Fowler 1991, 2008, Howell 1990, Kurz 1993, and Powell 2001.

Another important German reader-response critic was Hans-Robert Jauss, who defined literature as a dialectic process of production and reception (&quot;Rezeption&quot;—the term common in Germany for &quot;response&quot;). For Jauss, readers have a certain mental set, a &quot;horizon&quot; of expectations (&quot;Erwartungshorizont&quot;), from which perspective each reader, at any given time in history, reads. Reader-response criticism establishes these horizons of expectation by reading literary works of the period in question.

Both Iser and Jauss, along with the &quot;Constance School,&quot; exemplify and return reader-response criticism to a study of the text by defining readers in terms of the text. In the same way, Gerald Prince posits a &quot;narratee&quot;, Michael Riffaterre posits a &quot;superreader&quot;, and Stanley Fish an &quot;informed reader.&quot; And many text-oriented critics simply speak of &quot;the&quot; reader who typifies all readers.

==Objections==
Reader-response critics hold that in order to understand a text, one must look to the processes readers use to create meaning and experience. Traditional text-oriented schools, such as formalism, often think of reader-response criticism as an anarchic subjectivism, allowing readers to interpret a text any way they want. Text-oriented critics claim that one can understand a text while remaining immune to one&#x27;s own culture, status, personality, and so on, and hence &quot;objectively.&quot;

To reader-response based theorists, however, reading is always both subjective and objective. Some reader-response critics (uniformists) assume a bi-active model of reading: the literary work controls part of the response and the reader controls part. Others, who see that position as internally contradictory, claim that the reader controls the whole transaction (individualists). In such a reader-active model, readers and audiences use amateur or professional procedures for reading (shared by many others) as well as their personal issues and values.

Another objection to reader-response criticism is that it fails to account for the text being able to expand the reader&#x27;s understanding. While readers can and do put their own ideas and experiences into a work, they are at the same time gaining new understanding through the text. This is something that is generally overlooked in reader-response criticism.

==Extensions==

Reader-response criticism relates to psychology, both experimental psychology for those attempting to find principles of response, and psychoanalytic psychology for those studying individual responses. Post-behaviorist psychologists of reading and of perception support the idea that it is the reader who makes meaning. Increasingly, cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, neuroscience, and neuropsychoanalysis have given reader-response critics powerful and detailed models for the aesthetic process. In 2011 researchers found that during listening to emotionally intense parts of a story, readers respond with changes in heart rate variability, indicative of increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Intense parts of a story were also accompanied by increased brain activity in a network of regions known to be involved in the processing of fear, including the amygdala.

Because it rests on psychological principles, a reader-response approach readily generalizes to other arts: cinema (David Bordwell), music, or visual art (E. H. Gombrich), and even to history (Hayden White). In stressing the activity of the reader, reader-response theory may be employed to justify upsettings of traditional interpretations like deconstruction or cultural criticism.

Since reader-response critics focus on the strategies readers are taught to use, they may address the teaching of reading and literature. Also, because reader-response criticism stresses the activity of the reader, reader-response critics may share the concerns of feminist critics, and critics of gender and queer theory and postcolonialism.

<text>Evgeny Igorevich Kissin (, ; born 10 October 1971) is a Russian-born concert pianist and composer. He became a British citizen in 2002 and an Israeli citizen in 2013. He first came to international fame as a child prodigy. He has a wide repertoire and is especially known for his interpretations of the works of the Romantic era, particularly those of Franz Schubert, Frédéric Chopin, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Modest Mussorgsky and Ludwig van Beethoven. He is commonly viewed as a great successor of the Russian piano school because of the depth, lyricism and poetic quality of his interpretations.

==Early life and education==
Kissin was born in Moscow to Jewish parents. Recognized as a child prodigy at age six, he began piano studies at the city&#x27;s Gnessin Music School where he became a student of (1923–2021), who was to remain his only piano teacher.

At age ten he made his performing debut with Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 20 with the Ulyanovsk Symphony Orchestra. A year later he gave his first recital, in Moscow. His talents were revealed outside Russia after 27 March 1984 when, still only twelve, he recorded for Melodiya both of Chopin&#x27;s piano concertos with Dmitri Kitayenko and the Moscow Philharmonic at the Moscow Conservatory.

==Career==
===Concert pianist===
Kissin&#x27;s first appearances outside Russia were in 1985 in Eastern Europe, followed a year later by his first tour of Japan.

In 1987, at age sixteen, he made his West European debut at the Berlin Festival as well as his United Kingdom debut, alongside conductor Valery Gergiev and violinists Maxim Vengerov and Vadim Repin, at The Lichfield Festival. In 1988 he toured Europe with the Moscow Virtuosi and Vladimir Spivakov and also made his London debut with the London Symphony Orchestra under Valery Gergiev. In December of the same year he played Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 with Herbert von Karajan at the Berlin Philharmonic&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve Concert which was broadcast internationally, with the performance repeated the following year at the Salzburg Easter Festival. In September 1990, he made his North American debut playing Chopin&#x27;s two piano concertos with the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the first piano recital in Carnegie Hall&#x27;s centennial season.

In 1997 he gave the first solo piano recital in the history of The Proms in London.

Kissin made regular recital tours of Europe, America and Asia. He has performed with nearly all the leading orchestras of the world, under such conductors as Claudio Abbado, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Daniel Barenboim, Myung-Whun Chung, Sir Colin Davis, Vladimir Fedoseyev, Valery Gergiev, Carlo Maria Giulini, Mariss Jansons, Herbert von Karajan, Dmitri Kitaenko, Jan Latham-Koenig, Emmanuel Krivine, James Levine, Sir Andrew Davis, Lorin Maazel, Zubin Mehta, Riccardo Muti, Andris Nelsons, Seiji Ozawa, Sir Antonio Pappano, Sir Simon Rattle, Sir Georg Solti, Vladimir Spivakov, Yevgeny Svetlanov and Yuri Temirkanov. He has also performed chamber music with Martha Argerich, Mikhail Pletnev, Gidon Kremer, James Levine, Mischa Maisky, Thomas Quasthoff, Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Karita Mattila, Dmitry Hvorostovsky, Joshua Bell, Leonidas Kavakos, Natalia Gutman, Yuri Bashmet, Vladimir Spivakov, the Emerson String Quartet and others.

===Poetry===
In addition to classical music, Kissin has given recitations of Russian and Yiddish poetry and discussed his admiration for the Yiddish language in interviews about his life. Three CDs of Kissin&#x27;s recitals from the classical and contemporary Yiddish poetry have been issued by the Forward Association.

===Writing===
In 2018 Kissin&#x27;s autobiography was published under the title of &quot;Memoirs and Reflections&quot;. In 2019 his book of poems, short stories and translations in Yiddish was published under the title &quot;A Yiddisher Sheygets&quot;. In 2021, his book of short stories and diaries in Yiddish was published under the title &quot;Bloyz etlekhe minut gang&quot; (&quot;Only a few minutes by foot&quot;).

===Compositions===
Kissin has composed numerous musical works which have been published by Henle Verlag, including Four Piano Pieces, Op. 1 and Violoncello Sonata, op. 2.

His String Quartet, Op. 3 (2016) was recorded by the Kopelman Quartet on Nimbus Records and received its UK premiere on 26 February 2019 performed by the Endellion Quartet.

==Personal life==
On 10 March 2017 Kissin married Karina Arzumanova, a childhood friend, in Prague, where they live.

Kissin has also been an outspoken critic of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In 2022, Kissin and other Russian artists signed a letter against the invasion. The piano trio he composed in response to the invasion was premiered in Amsterdam on 14 October 2022. Kissin was declared a foreign agent by the Russian government in July 2024.

==Awards and accolades==
Many musical awards and tributes from around the world have been bestowed upon Kissin. In 1987 he received the Crystal Prize of the Osaka Symphony Hall for the best performance of the year in 1986 (his first performance in Japan). In 1991 he received the Musician of the Year Prize from the Chigiana Academy of Music in Siena, Italy. He performed at the 1992 Grammy Awards Ceremony, where he played the finale of Liszt&#x27;s Spanish Rhapsody. That same year his Carnegie Hall debut album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance, though he lost to pianist Alicia de Larrocha. He became Musical America&#x27;s youngest Instrumentalist of the Year in 1995. In 1997 he received the Triumph Award for his outstanding contribution to Russia&#x27;s culture, one of the highest cultural honors to be awarded in the Russian Republic, and again, the youngest-ever awardee. He was the first pianist to be invited to give a recital at the BBC Proms (1997), and, in the 2000 season, was the first concerto soloist ever to be invited to play in the Proms opening concert.

In May 2001 Kissin was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music by the Manhattan School of Music. In December 2003 in Moscow, he received the Shostakovich Award, one of Russia&#x27;s highest musical honors. In June 2005 he was awarded an Honorary Membership of the Royal Academy of Music in London. In March 2009 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Hong Kong.

<doc id="379706" wikidata="Q1200338" url="?curid=379706" title="D. H. Lehmer">
<text>Derrick Henry &quot;Dick&quot; Lehmer (February 23, 1905 – May 22, 1991), almost always cited as D.H. Lehmer, was an American mathematician significant to the development of computational number theory. Lehmer refined Édouard Lucas&#x27; work in the 1930s and devised the Lucas–Lehmer test for Mersenne primes. His peripatetic career as a number theorist, with him and his wife taking numerous types of work in the United States and abroad to support themselves during the Great Depression, fortuitously brought him into the center of research into early electronic computing.

==Early life==
Lehmer was born in Berkeley, California, to Derrick Norman Lehmer, a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and Clara Eunice Mitchell.

He studied physics and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from UC Berkeley, and continued with graduate studies at the University of Chicago.

He and his father worked together on Lehmer sieves.

==Marriage==
During his studies at Berkeley, Lehmer met Emma Markovna Trotskaia, a Russian student of his father&#x27;s, who had begun with work toward an engineering degree but had subsequently switched focus to mathematics, earning her B.A. in 1928. Later that same year, Lehmer married Emma and, following a tour of Northern California and a trip to Japan to meet Emma&#x27;s family, they moved by car to Providence, Rhode Island, after Brown University offered him an instructorship.

==Career==
Lehmer received a master&#x27;s degree and a Ph.D., both from Brown University, in 1929 and 1930, respectively; his wife obtained a master&#x27;s degree in 1930 as well, coaching mathematics to supplement the family income, while also helping her husband type his Ph.D. thesis, &quot;An Extended Theory of Lucas&#x27; Functions&quot;, which he wrote under Jacob Tamarkin.

===Movements during the Depression===
Lehmer became a National Research Fellow, allowing him to take positions at the California Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1931 and at Stanford University from 1931 to 1932. In the latter year, the couple&#x27;s first child Laura was born.

After being awarded a second National Research Fellowship, the Lehmers moved on to Princeton, New Jersey between 1932 and 1934, where Dick spent a short time at the Institute for Advanced Study.

He worked at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania from 1934 until 1938. Their son Donald was born in 1934 while Dick and Emma were at Lehigh.

The year 1938–1939 was spent in England on a Guggenheim Fellowship visiting both the University of Cambridge and the University of Manchester, meeting G. H. Hardy, John Edensor Littlewood, Harold Davenport, Kurt Mahler, Louis Mordell, and Paul Erdős. The Lehmers returned to America by ship with second child Donald just before the beginning of the Battle of the Atlantic.

Lehmer continued at Lehigh University for the 1939–1940 academic year.

===Berkeley===
In 1940, Lehmer accepted a position back at the mathematics department of UC Berkeley. Lehmer was chairman of the Department of Mathematics at University of California, Berkeley from 1954 until 1957. He continued working at UC Berkeley until 1972, the year he became professor emeritus.

===ENIAC and computer science===
From 1945 to 1946, Lehmer served on the Computations Committee at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland, a group established as part of the Ballistics Research Laboratory to prepare the ENIAC for utilization following its completion at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Moore School of Electrical Engineering; the other Computations Committee members were Haskell Curry, Leland Cunningham, and Franz Alt. It was during this short tenure that the Lehmers ran some of the first test programs on the ENIAC—according to their academic interests, these tests involved number theory, especially sieve methods, but also pseudorandom number generation. When they could arrange child care, the Lehmers spent weekends staying up all night running such problems, the first over the Thanksgiving weekend of 1945. (Such tests were run without cost, since the ENIAC would have been left powered on anyway in the interest of minimizing vacuum tube failures.) The problem run during the 3-day Independence Day weekend of July 4, 1946, with John Mauchly serving as computer operator, ran around the clock without interruption or failure. The following Tuesday, July 9, 1946, Lehmer delivered the talk &quot;Computing Machines for Pure Mathematics&quot; as part of the Moore School Lectures, in which he introduced computing as an experimental science, and demonstrated the wit and humor typical of his teaching lectures.

Lehmer would remain active in computing developments for the remainder of his career. Upon his return to Berkeley, he made plans for building the California Digital Computer (CALDIC) with Paul Morton and Leland Cunningham. In September 1949, he presented the pseudorandom number generator now known as the Lehmer random number generator.

D. H. Lehmer wrote the article &quot;The Machine Tools of Combinatorics,&quot; which is the first chapter in Edwin Beckenbach&#x27;s &quot;Applied Combinatorial Mathematics&quot; (1964). It describes methods for producing permutations, combinations, etc. This was a uniquely valuable resource and has only been rivaled recently by Volume 4 of Donald Knuth&#x27;s series.

The Lehmers also assisted Harry Vandiver with his work on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, using the Standards Western Automatic Computer to do many calculations involving Bernoulli numbers.

===McCarthy era===
In 1950, Lehmer was one of 31 University of California faculty fired after refusing to sign a loyalty oath, a policy initiated by the Board of Regents of the State of California in 1950 during the Communist scare personified by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Lehmer took a post as Director of the National Bureau of Standards&#x27; Institute for Numerical Analysis (INA), working with the Standards Western Automatic Computer (SWAC). On October 17, 1952, the State Supreme Court proclaimed the oath unconstitutional, and Lehmer returned to Berkeley shortly thereafter.

===Later years===
Lehmer continued to be active for many years. When John Selfridge was at Northern Illinois University he twice invited Lehmer and Emma to spend a semester there. One year Selfridge arranged that Erdős and Lehmer taught a course together on Research Problems in the Theory of Numbers. Lehmer taught the first eight weeks and then Erdős taught the remainder. Erdős didn&#x27;t often teach a course, and he said, &quot;You know it wasn&#x27;t that difficult. The only problem was being there.&quot;

Lehmer had quite a wit. On the occasion of the first Asilomar number theory conference, which became an annual event (now called West Coast Number Theory), Lehmer, as the organizer, was inspecting the facilities of the Asilomar Conference Grounds—basically a wooden building on the beach. Someone said they couldn&#x27;t find a blackboard and Lehmer spotted some curtains in the middle of the wall. Moving the curtains aside revealed a very small blackboard, whereupon Lehmer said &quot;Well, I guess we won&#x27;t be doing any analytic number theory!&quot;

===Lasting impact===
In addition to his significant contributions to number theory algorithms for multiprecision integers, such as factoring, Euclid&#x27;s algorithm, long division, and proof of primality, he also formulated Lehmer&#x27;s conjecture and participated in the Cunningham project.

===Death===
Lehmer died in Berkeley on May 22, 1991.

<text>Oboi (Manchu: , Mölendorff: Oboi; ) (c. 1610–1669) was a prominent Manchu military commander and courtier who served in various military and administrative posts under three successive emperors of the early Qing dynasty. Born to the Guwalgiya clan, Oboi was one of four regents nominated by the Shunzhi Emperor to oversee the government during the minority of the Kangxi Emperor. Oboi reversed the benevolent policies of the Shunzhi Emperor, and vigorously pushed for clear reassertion of Manchu power over the Han Chinese. Eventually deposed and imprisoned by the new emperor for having amassed too much power, he was posthumously rehabilitated.

==Early life and military career==
Oboi was born to the Manchu Gūwalgiya clan, which had been distinguishing itself militarily since Oboi&#x27;s grandfather Solgo submitted to Nurhaci (1559–1626) in 1588. Under the Manchu Banner organization created by Nurhaci, Oboi&#x27;s branch of the family was registered under the Bordered Yellow Banner which came under the command of Nurhaci&#x27;s son Hong Taiji (1592–1643). Oboi&#x27;s father Uici (衛齊) (d. 1634) was a senior military officer who was once garrison commander of the Manchu capital city Mukden while his paternal uncle Fiongdon was one of Nurhaci&#x27;s most trusted generals.

Oboi&#x27;s childhood and early years are relatively obscure. Being his father&#x27;s third son, he was not destined to inherit the family&#x27;s hereditary position in the Banner hierarchy. Oboi was first mentioned in official Qing history in the &quot;Veritable Records of Qing Taizong [Hong Taiji]&quot; (清太宗實錄) in 1632, documenting his triumphant return from a minor raid into Ming territories in which he was allowed to keep his spoils as reward.

Oboi officially started his military career in 1634 during the reign of Hong Taiji as a junior officer in the Banner&#x27;s cavalry guard unit in which capacity he distinguished himself many times in battle against Ming forces and was renowned for his personal bravery. For this, he was granted a hereditary commission as captain of a company (&quot;niru i janggin&quot;). In 1633 and 1634 he took part in campaigns against the Chahar Mongols, whose leader Ligdan Khan submitted to the Manchus in 1635.

In 1637 during the Manchu&#x27;s second campaign against Korea, Oboi volunteered and succeeded in capturing the small but strategically important Ka Island (then known as &quot;Pidao&quot; in Chinese) south of the Yalu River, from which the Ming army had led operations against the Liaodong peninsula, the main focus of armed conflict between the Manchus and the Ming. After a difficult amphibious landing followed by desperate hand-to-hand combat the defending Ming garrison was annihilated. For this achievement he was promoted to the rank of a hereditary colonel third-class and bestowed the rare honorific title of &quot;Baturu&quot; (巴圖魯), which means &quot;(brave) warrior&quot; in Manchu. In 1641, Oboi again distinguished himself in battle scoring five victories in as many encounters in the consecutive sieges of Jinzhou and Songshan, two of the last Ming strongholds in Liaodong. He was promoted to full colonel and given command of the &quot;Bayarai&quot; guards of the Bordered Yellow Banner.

After the death of Hong Taiji in 1643, Oboi supported the late ruler&#x27;s eldest son Hooge over Dorgon during the ensuing succession crisis. Despite Hooge&#x27;s faction losing out to Dorgon&#x27;s proposed compromised candidate, Hong Taiji&#x27;s youngest son Fulin, Oboi continued to participate in military campaigns through the Qing dynasty&#x27;s successful invasion of China in 1644. His rise in the Bordered Yellow Banner hierarchy continued apace with the Qing conquest of the Ming. In 1645 he was promoted to the rank of general. From 1644 to 1648 Oboi was part of the armies that fought bandit and self declared emperor Li Zicheng (nemesis of the last Ming emperor), bandit king Zhang Xianzhong, and the remnants of Zhang&#x27;s armies after Zhang was killed in 1647. &quot;Draft History of Qing&quot; claims that in early 1647 during the campaign to pacify Sichuan, Oboi was responsible for slaying Zhang in battle. However other Qing records show an entirely different account, one where one of Zhang&#x27;s commanders, Liu Jinzhong defected to the Qing after fearing being the next victim of Zhang&#x27;s ongoing purge and execution of his own commanders and soldiers, leading the Qing soldiers and Haoge directly to Zhang Xianzhong&#x27;s camp where Zhang was alerted to their presence and decided to confront them with only 8 to 10 men. Zhang was shot and killed by an anonymous archer from the Qing army after Liu identified Zhang to the Qing troops. Oboi is nowhere mentioned in this other account as being responsible for Zhang Xianzhong&#x27;s death nor was Zhang beheaded in this account.

In 1648, when Hooge was imprisoned and convicted by Dorgon, Oboi was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to loss of rank. Despite his demotion, in 1648 and 1649 he took part in a campaign to extirpate Ming turncoat Jiang Xiang (姜瓖; d. 1649)––who had now turned against the Qing––from his base in Datong (Shaanxi, north China).

==Persecution and rehabilitation==
As a member of the Bordered Yellow Banner, Oboi&#x27;s loyalty to his Banner master was crucial to his rapid advancement during the years when Hong Taiji commanded the Banner. However, after Hong Taiji&#x27;s death, Oboi&#x27;s loyalty to his new Banner master Hooge became a political liability. When Dorgon who commanded the White and Bordered White Banners became regent to the young Shunzhi Emperor, he sought to weaken the influence of the other Banners at court by purging the ranks of their senior commanders. Just as Hooge was arrested and eventually died in prison, in 1648 Oboi was stripped of his rank and titles under a charge of claiming false victories in battle. Later he was found guilty of a more serious crime of conspiracy to elect Hooge as emperor during the succession dispute after Hong Taiji&#x27;s death. This later charge carried with it the death penalty, however the sentence was commuted while he continued to command troops against Ming loyalists. The charges against Oboi were most likely politically motivated and were rehabilitated in 1651 after Dorgon&#x27;s death. Oboi for his unswerving loyalty to his Banner and services to the Qing government was appointed a cabinet minister by Shunzhi Emperor, who also bestowed on him the title of Marquis of the First Rank.

The extent of the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s trust in Oboi&#x27;s loyalty can be gauged by the honours the emperor showered on him. In 1652 after Shunzhi successfully purged the court of the more powerful elements in Dorgon&#x27;s faction, Oboi was elevated to a hereditary Duke of the Second Rank and more importantly appointed the commander of the imperial bodyguard (領侍衛內大臣), a job which doubled as the &quot;de facto&quot; police chief in the capital. In this capacity Oboi acted as Shunzhi&#x27;s much feared enforcer against Dorgon&#x27;s old cohorts and helped to consolidate power to the throne and the Emperor&#x27;s own &quot;Upper Three Banners&quot;. During the period of Shunzhi&#x27;s personal rule, Oboi was responsible for the arrest and execution of a number of noblemen found guilty of one crime or another. Although there is no doubt that these executions were carried out with the approval of Shunzhi, it is not surprising that after the emperor&#x27;s death, Oboi, given his ruthless character and position in court, when left uncontrolled by a higher authority would eventually come to dominate court politics creating a deep state centered on himself.

==Regency==
The Shunzhi Emperor died from smallpox on February 5, 1661, at the age of 24. On his deathbed he appointed four &quot;Executive Ministers&quot; (輔政大臣) commonly referred to as regents to &quot;assist&quot; his eight-year-old son Xuanye to govern the country until the young emperor reached the age of maturity at 16. The four ministers in their order of seniority were Sonin of the Yellow Banner, who apart from being chief minister of the Imperial Household Department (內務府大臣) was also nominated by Empress Dowager Zhaosheng to head the regency. The second minister on the list was Suksaha of the White Banner. Originally a trusted deputy of Dorgon, Suksaha was politically astute enough to switch sides immediately after the former regent&#x27;s death when the court was still dominated by Dorgon&#x27;s associates. By the time of the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s death he was one of the emperor&#x27;s most trusted courtiers. Then came Ebilun and Oboi, both members of the Bordered Yellow Banner. The Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s succession plan set a precedent for the Qing dynasty of nominating courtiers who owed their loyalty to the crown to &quot;assist&quot; a young emperor during the years of minority in running the state. This reflected the lesson learned from Dorgon&#x27;s regency, when the regent grew almost too powerful for the emperor to control. Unfortunately, this system of appointing ministers to oversee the government during an emperor&#x27;s minority proved not to be a very stable political device after all.

Three of the four ministers, Sonin, Ebilun and Oboi were members of the &quot;Two Yellow Banners&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; Yellow Banner and Bordered Yellow Banner) previously under the command of the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s elder brother Hooge. Because of the personal and political rivalries between Hooge and Dorgon, all three men were persecuted at one time or another during Dorgon&#x27;s regency for their Banner affiliation. However their loyalty thus proven was also key to their rapid advancement after Dorgon&#x27;s death. It was a major factor in Shunzhi&#x27;s choice of personnel to oversee his son&#x27;s regency. However Shunzhi&#x27;s arrangement heightened the already sensitive relationship between the three members of the Yellow Banners and Suksaha who belonged to the White Banner. Suksaha was a much despised figure at this point not only because he was a member of the White Banner in an imperial court dominated by the two Yellow Banners, but also because he gained the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s trust by denouncing his former master Dorgon, an action seen by his colleagues including members of the White Banner as disloyal.

In the first years of the regency, the tension between the Yellow Banners faction and Suksaha was kept in check by the even handed Sonin and thus the four ministers maintained a relatively peaceful and efficient working relationship. But the dynamics of the regency began to change as Sonin&#x27;s health deteriorated due to old age. As Sonin gradually took more time off, Oboi monopolized decision making by dominating the indecisive Ebilun and worked to sideline Suksaha during policy discussions especially on issues concerning welfare of the Manchu Eight Banners. By 1667 when Sonin realized he did not have long to live, he tried a last-ditch effort to restore balance to the regency and neutralize Oboi&#x27;s rapidly expanding power clique by petitioning the then 14-year-old Kangxi Emperor to assume personal rule ahead of schedule. Thus Kangxi formerly took over the reins of power in an ascension ceremony on August 25, 1667, a month after Sonin&#x27;s death. This was followed by an official decree technically downgrading the three remaining ministers to the status of &quot;advisers&quot; (佐政大臣) while still remaining at their posts. However even with the formal authority of office, the young Kangxi Emperor found it difficult to curb the growing power of Oboi.

==Conflict with the Kangxi Emperor==
Oboi forced the young Kangxi Emperor to execute Suksaha and his family. He controlled Ebilun completely and then finally established a system of near absolute rule under himself.

The Kangxi Emperor took power earlier than expected at the age of 15 in 1669. The emperor suddenly had Oboi arrested on 30 charges. Oboi was sentenced to death but it was reduced to imprisonment in consideration of his achievements. Some sources say that he displayed the many wounds on his body that had been received in the defense of Kangxi&#x27;s great-grandfather Nurhaci, this act had apparently moved the Kangxi Emperor to pardon Oboi.

Oboi was posthumously rehabilitated. The Kangxi Emperor issued a pardon in 1713, while his successor, the Yongzheng Emperor, granted Oboi the rank of a First Class Duke and the posthumous title &quot;Chaowu&quot; (超武 &quot;exceedingly martial&quot;) but Yongzheng&#x27;s successor, the Qianlong Emperor, gave Oboi the lower title of First Class Baron after reviewing his merits and demerits.

==In popular culture==
Oboi appears as an antagonist in the early part of the wuxia novel &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; by Jin Yong. In the novel, he is depicted as a cruel, power-hungry regent plotting to usurp the throne from the Kangxi Emperor. With help from the protagonist Wei Xiaobao, the emperor manages to remove Oboi from power and imprison him. Oboi is eventually killed in prison by Wei Xiaobao.

In the 2017 Chinese TV series &quot;Legend of Dragon Pearl&quot; Oboi is portrayed by Xiao Rongsheng. Oboi is shown to be an oppressive roadblock for the Kangxi Emperor in his mission regain his full political power and reaffirm his sovereignty.

<doc id="379716" wikidata="Q121841" url="?curid=379716" title="Leela (Futurama)">
<text>Turanga Leela is a fictional character from the animated television series &quot;Futurama&quot;. Leela is spaceship captain, pilot, and head of all aviation services on board the &quot;Planet Express Ship&quot;. Throughout the series, she has an on-again, off-again relationship with Philip J. Fry, the central character in the series. The character, voiced by Katey Sagal, is named after the &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot; by Olivier Messiaen. She is one of the few characters in the cast to routinely display competence and the ability to command, and routinely saves the rest of the cast from disaster. However, she suffers extreme self-doubt because she has only one eye and grew up as a bullied orphan. She first believes herself an alien, but later finds out she is the least-mutated sewer mutant in the history of 31st-century Earth. Her family (particularly her parents&#x27; accent and &quot;outcast&quot; status) parodies aspects of pollution and undesirability associated with industrial New Jersey when compared with New York City.

==Fictional character biography==
Turanga Leela was born to Morris and Munda, two mutants who live in the sewer deep under New New York City. The mutant doctor who delivered Leela remarked that she was &quot;the least mutated mutant ever born&quot;. When Leela was still an infant, her parents gave her up to the Cookieville Minimum Security Orphanarium with a note written in mysterious symbols to suggest that Leela was an alien, so that she would have a better life than a typical mutant.

For the first three seasons of the series, Leela hopes to meet another member of her race of one-eyed aliens. In the episode &quot;A Bicyclops Built for Two&quot;, Leela meets Alcazar, a cyclops who convinces her that he and she are the last two members of their extinct race, only to discover that he is a shapeshifting impostor who just wanted to marry her so she would be his maid. Leela&#x27;s parents&#x27; plan for concealing her origins works well until an industrial accident caused by environmentally irresponsible Bender brings Leela and her friends into the New New York City&#x27;s sewer system where for the first time Leela meets her parents and discovers that she is not a cyclopean alien, but is actually a sewer mutant.

In the episode &quot;The Problem with Popplers&quot;, Leela&#x27;s family name, Turanga, was used for the first time. The episode &quot;Less Than Hero&quot; establishes that among Leela and her parents, their family name is placed before the given name.

===Character development===
Leela&#x27;s orphan upbringing and mysterious origins are helpful to fuel the development of her character over the course of the series.

Despite her strong-willed nature, she often feels self-conscious about her distinctive appearance, and at one point elects to have surgery to give her the appearance of having two normal-sized eyes, though she later has this reversed. Leela&#x27;s single eye hampers her depth perception and is sometimes exploited for comic effect, for instance, in the episode &quot;The Problem with Popplers&quot; it is suggested that she actually &quot;is&quot; crashing into billboards every time in the opening credits, though it typically does not interfere with her ability to pilot the &quot;Planet Express Ship&quot; (beyond crashing into the odd billboard) or her mastery of martial arts.

Originally a career placement officer for new defrostees at a cryogenics lab in the year 2999, Leela quit her job after meeting Philip J. Fry, a defrostee from 1999, and Bender, a high-tech, job-deserting, girder bending robot. Together they are employed as the crew for Planet Express, an intergalactic delivery business run by Fry&#x27;s distant relative, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth. Leela serves as captain of the &quot;Planet Express Ship&quot;, proving herself to be a skilled officer and often rescuing her less-talented coworkers from peril.

Leela is an avid environmentalist. In &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour Lost in Space&quot;, Leela and crew are sent to Vergon 6, a planet that is about to collapse because of mining. Her mission is to save the animal inhabitants of the planet. The mission winds up unsuccessful because of a small animal Leela finds because he ate the rest of the rescued animals. This animal, who she names Nibbler, becomes her pet for the remainder of the series. Her environmentalist beliefs resurface again in &quot;&quot;. Despite her love of animals and nature, she embarks on an Ahab-like quest to kill a space whale in the episode &quot;Möbius Dick&quot;.

===Abilities===
Leela is a skilled martial artist and adept acrobat, weapons expert and survivalist. In the episode &quot;Raging Bender&quot;, a flashback revealed that she had earned a red belt in Kung Fu as a teenager, but despite her besting all the other students, she quit due to her sexist instructor, whom she beat up years later. She is very athletic and in great physical condition, with most males (of any species) unable to match her in physical combat.

===Relationships===
; Philip J. Fry: Leela&#x27;s and Fry&#x27;s relationship is a major plot line that runs throughout the series. Fry frequently asks for dates, though she repeatedly turns him down despite her usual romantic mishaps. There are various moments when she does fall for him even briefly, especially whenever he would risk his life for her. She sees him as a true friend and does not want anything more of him, but it constantly appears as if she is hiding (and denying herself) deeper feelings for him, saying &quot;I love his boyish charm, but I hate his childishness&quot;. At the end of the film &quot;&quot;, Leela openly admits to loving Fry, and shows greater attraction to him from the episode &quot;Rebirth&quot; onward, though their relationship varies. In &quot;The Prisoner of Benda&quot;, the two share a romantic interlude, though their personalities have been switched to different bodies. In the episode &quot;Fry Am the Egg Man&quot;, while being hit on by Angus McZongo, she says that she and Fry are strictly platonic. In &quot;Overclockwise&quot;, Leela expresses concerns over their &quot;on-again-off-again&quot; relationship, but by the end of that episode, Bender reveals Fry and Leela&#x27;s future to them, and while the viewer is not told its details, Leela and Fry are clearly pleased with them. The relationship continues through the seventh season, culminating in Fry proposing to Leela. Before she can accept, however, an accident with the Professor&#x27;s new invention results in the universe being frozen in time, except for her and Fry. They get married anyway and have a happy life together as the only unfrozen beings in existence. Years later, the Professor appears through an interdimensional wormhole and offers them the chance to go back in time to before the universe froze. Fry asks Leela if she wants to &quot;go around again&quot; with him, a proposal she happily accepts. The eighth season, picking up ten years after time was frozen, shows a young-again Fry and Leela continuing their relationship, and they eventually move in together in the episode &quot;Related to Items You&#x27;ve Viewed&quot;.

; Lars Fillmore:After a freak accident involving Hermes&#x27; decapitated body, Leela meets Lars at the Head Museum where Hermes&#x27; head is being kept alive. Lars later delivers Hermes&#x27; new head jar and asks Leela out for dinner and the two begin dating. During the same time Leela and Lars begin dating, the world is taken over by an alien species that overtook robots by scamming people into giving them personal information. The scammers find the secret to time travel tattooed on Fry&#x27;s butt. After the scammers have stolen all-important artifacts from throughout history, they seek to destroy Fry&#x27;s body so no one else can time travel. Fry escapes back to the 21st century with Bender on his tail. Bender believes he murdered Fry and heads back to the future. Fry shows up and tells his story of how he got back to the future. The Professor reveals a formula that he then explains to be why anybody that is duplicated due to time travel is doomed. Lars proposes to Leela in &quot;&quot;. Lars saves the crew from a bomb dropped by Robot Santa and Fry becomes even more upset and jealous. Lars and Leela were to marry on Sunday, December 27, 3007 at 4 o&#x27;clock. During the ceremony Lars leaves Leela at the altar because Hermes&#x27; body was again destroyed because of the time paradox duplicate rule, and he did not want their wedding to be riddled with sadness. Fry sees Leela&#x27;s sadness and devises a plan to try to get Leela and Lars back together. During this encounter, it is revealed that Lars is actually Fry&#x27;s time paradox body duplicate whose hair and voice was altered by when Bender tried to kill him and grew more mature over the years. He later dies due to being a time paradox body duplicate, but Leela&#x27;s relationship with him helps make her closer to the original Fry.

; Zapp Brannigan:During a visit aboard The Nimbus, Leela has pity sex with the pompous, idiotic captain Zapp Brannigan in the episode where he is first introduced, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost in Space&quot;; according to Groening, the episode marked a turning point in the series, as it showed that the writers could degrade the main heroine without alienating viewers from the show. Throughout the series, Brannigan constantly tries to entice her into dates and romantic encounters, much to her disgust, Leela denouncing him as an incompetent lover and general idiot. The next encounter Leela has with Zapp is in &quot;A Flight to Remember&quot;, during a cruise on the Titanic. Leela, worried Zapp might try to court her, tells Zapp she is dating Fry. Zapp suspects she is lying and invites her and Fry to dine at the captain&#x27;s table with him. Zapp does his best to catch them in the lie but due to changing the ship&#x27;s course earlier in the episode, which eventually leads the ship into a black hole, is called away from the table. Leela is able to make it off the ship with the rest of the crew in an escape pod and avoid an unwanted sexual encounter with Zapp. In &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela&quot;, while on a mission with him they crash-land and he tricks her into thinking they are what&#x27;s left of humanity and should be the new Adam and Eve, which she agrees to. When she discovers the ruse, she reluctantly has sex with him to save the Earth from a planet-destroying satellite.

; Nibbler (Non-Romantic):Leela and the rest of the Planet Express Ship&#x27;s crew are sent on a mission to a planet called Vergon 6 in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour Lost in Space&quot;. On their way to the planet, The Planet Express Ship is intercepted by The Nimbus, captained by Zapp Brannigan. Leela decides to ask Zapp for help in saving the animals from the doomed planet of Vergon 6. Zapp denies her request and imprisons the crew based on their intention of breaking Brannigan&#x27;s law. According to Brannigan&#x27;s law, no one is allowed to interfere with undeveloped planets. A committed environmentalist and lover of animals, Leela defies Brannigan&#x27;s orders in order to save the animals of Vergon 6. During the final moments of the planet&#x27;s existence Leela finds Nibbler, a lone animal of the planet, and adopts him as a pet. Later in the series Nibbler reveals himself to be a member of an ancient race of wise, sophisticated beings known as the Nibblonians. In the episode I Second That Emotion, Bender becomes frustrated with the attention that Nibbler is getting. Seeking to get rid of Nibbler and claim the attention for himself, Bender flushes Nibbler down the toilet. When Bender shows no remorse for his actions Leela becomes frustrated with his inability to see her pain. She has The Professor install a microchip onto Bender to force him to mirror her emotions. Due to Leela&#x27;s sadness from losing Nibbler, Bender goes into the sewers to find him. Leela goes after Bender and Nibbler but runs into trouble when a sewer monster urban legend shows to be true. In order to save herself and Nibbler, Leela learns to be a little more selfish.

; Adlai Atkins (voiced by Tom Kenny): The only other success to come from Leela&#x27;s orphanage, Adlai was a remarkably average man who had become a cosmetic surgeon. He grafts a second eye onto Leela&#x27;s face - which gives her a normal appearance, although she still cannot actually &quot;see&quot; through the other eye - and the two began dating, but when Adlai commented that an orphan with a third ear on her forehead could be given an operation to be &#x27;acceptable&#x27;, Leela realizes that she had been better off as she was and makes Adlai undo the surgery.

; Al Alcazar: Initially the first other cyclops Leela met, Alcazar claimed that their planet had been destroyed in a war and the two of them were the only survivors, prompting Leela to accept his proposal of marriage despite his boorish nature and mistreatment of her. However, Fry discovers that Alcazar was actually a shape-shifting grasshopper-like alien who sought to marry &#x27;five alien weirdos&#x27; to clean his five castles, and the wedding was swiftly called off. Alcazar is a parody of Al Bundy, the main character of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, the sitcom on which Katey Sagal costarred.

; Chaz (voiced by Bob Odenkirk): The mayor&#x27;s aide. There is only one thing that he cannot do, &quot;fail the mayor&quot;. He dated Leela and she seemed to be in love with him because of his stature, but Leela dumped him when he wouldn&#x27;t let orphans skate with them because he was too important.

; Sean / Leela&#x27;s uneducated ex-boyfriend: The two were in a relationship prior to Fry&#x27;s arrival to the future, but they broke up. Leela claims that the breakup was mutual, but Sean claims that she was crazy. Sean&#x27;s first appearance in the show is in &quot;Fry and Leela&#x27;s Big Fling&quot;, where he demonstrates his musical talent before being challenged to a fight by Fry. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Sean is now married to Darlene whom he met in the 99-cent store.

==Character creation==

===Conception===
Though the series described Turanga Leela as a one-eyed alien in its first episodes, &quot;Futurama&quot; creator Matt Groening and executive producer David X. Cohen had in mind that she would turn out to be the child of sewer-dwelling mutants before the series was pitched to executives. The mutants later revealed to be Leela&#x27;s parents appear as background characters in the season 2 episode &quot;I Second That Emotion&quot;, providing an early hint at her origin. Later in the series it is revealed that her parents had given her up to an orphanage (styled an &#x27;orphanarium&#x27;) in order to give her a chance at living a normal life on the surface, passing her off as an alien due to her relative lack of distinguishing mutant features. According to Groening, the cyclopean but otherwise comely Leela subverts the science-fiction cliché of glamorously perfect female heroines.

An early file Groening compiled on Leela lists some of her intended qualities: &quot;strong-willed, opinionated, gentle (when not fighting), gives orders, unlucky in love, loves weapons, loves animals&quot;. Katey Sagal describes her as a &quot;tough, strong career girl who just can&#x27;t get it together in the rest of her life...she&#x27;s vulnerable and hard at the same time&quot;.

===Name===
Her name plays on &quot;Turangalîla&quot;, the Sanskrit title of the 1948 &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot; by French composer Olivier Messiaen. The &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot; has four cyclical themes; its title can be roughly translated as &quot;love song&quot;. Her given name, Leela (/ˈli.laː/), is the word for lilac in many Indo-European languages (such as French, German, Italian, Dutch and Swedish). Groening also stated in the show&#x27;s DVD commentary that Leela&#x27;s name is also a tribute to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion of the same name who served alongside the Fourth Doctor, who makes cameo appearances in episode 103 (&quot;Möbius Dick&quot;) and episode 111 (&quot;All the Presidents&#x27; Heads&quot;).

===Design===

Besides her oversized single eye, Leela&#x27;s other distinctive features include her purple hair tied in a ponytail by a black hair tie and relatively small nose. The ponytail was included so that Leela, like the other main characters in &quot;Futurama&quot; and Groening&#x27;s other cartoon &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, would be recognizable in silhouette. During the many stages of character design, Groening decided to give Leela a large nose just for fun, but the animators resisted the idea, believing that it was unnatural. The animators ended up drawing Leela with a small nose based on Groening&#x27;s original drawing of Leela, which he references as his &quot;idea of a sexy babe&quot;. Animator Gregg Vanzo notes that the artists also had initial difficulties drawing facial expressions and moods for Leela because of her single eye. Leela&#x27;s usual clothing consists of a low-cut white tank top, leggings and boots. Groening intended Leela to be portrayed as attractive and sexy, but had to instruct the animators to de-emphasize exaggerated aspects of their original design that were too &quot;racy&quot;. However, Leela is still considered attractive and sexy, even beautiful by several such as Fry and Zapp Brannigan.

Leela wears an electronic device on her wrist, referred to in one episode as a &quot;wristlojackimator;&quot; it is capable of a variety of tasks, similar to The Doctor&#x27;s sonic screwdriver or the tricorders of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

===Casting===
Katey Sagal provides the voice of Leela. Sagal immediately wanted the role when she was asked to audition for Groening. She is one of the few primarily live-action actors in the &quot;Futurama&quot; cast. In an interview, Sagal said: &quot;This is acting, but a different type of acting. You&#x27;re not using your whole tool here—your body and physicality—but it&#x27;s challenging that way. The animation work is really unusual. I don&#x27;t have the same experience doing it as the people I work with.&quot; Sagal notes that she found out years after accepting the part that someone else (comedian Nicole Sullivan) had previously been cast as Leela but the creators had decided to replace her. She also notes that she does not change Leela&#x27;s voice much from her own natural voice but she does try to make it a little higher-pitched.

<doc id="379723" wikidata="Q1141226" url="?curid=379723" title="Dairy Queen">
<text>International Dairy Queen, Inc. (DQ) is an American multinational fast food chain founded in 1940 and currently headquartered in Bloomington, Minnesota. The first Dairy Queen was owned and operated by Sherb Noble and first opened on June 22, 1940, in Joliet, Illinois. It serves a variety of hot and fried food, as well as original frozen dairy products that vary from location to location.

==History==
The soft-serve formula was first developed in 1938 by John Fremont &quot;J.F.&quot; McCullough and his son Alex. They convinced friend and loyal customer Sherb Noble to offer the product in his ice cream store in Kankakee, Illinois. On the first day of sales, Noble sold more than 1,600 servings of the new dessert within two hours. Noble and the McCulloughs went on to open the first Dairy Queen store in 1940 in Joliet, Illinois. It closed in the 1950s, but the 501 N Chicago Street building is a city-designated landmark.
Since 1940, the chain has used a franchise system to expand its operations globally. The first ten stores in 1941 grew to 100 by 1947, 1,446 in 1950, and 2,600 in 1955. The first store in Canada opened in Estevan, Saskatchewan, in 1953. 

The company became International Dairy Queen, Inc. (IDQ) in 1962. IDQ is the parent company of American Dairy Queen Corporation (often abbreviated &quot;Am. D.Q. Corp.&quot; in the chain&#x27;s legal disclaimers), Dairy Queen Canada Inc., and other entities that franchise the Dairy Queen concept.

In 1987, IDQ bought the Orange Julius chain. IDQ was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway in 1998. In the 1990s, investors bought Dairy Queen stores that were individually owned, intending to increase profitability through economies of scale. Vasari, LLC became the second-largest Dairy Queen operator in the country and operated 70 Dairy Queens across Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. When stores were not profitable, the firm closed them. On October 30, 2017, Vasari LLC filed for bankruptcy and announced it was closing 29 DQ stores, including ten in the Texas Panhandle.

In the US, the state with the most Dairy Queen restaurants is Texas. Using the 2010 census, the state with the most Dairy Queen restaurants per person is Minnesota. At the end of fiscal year 2014, Dairy Queen reported over 6,400 stores in more than 25 countries; about 4,500 of them (approximately 70%) were in the United States.

Dairy Queens were a fixture of social life in small Midwestern and Southern United States towns during the 1950s and 1960s. They have often been reflected in stories and memoirs of small-town America, as in &quot;Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen: Reflections at Sixty and Beyond&quot; by Larry McMurtry, &quot;Dairy Queen Days&quot; by Robert Inman, &quot;Chevrolet Summers, Dairy Queen Nights&quot; by Bob Greene, and &quot;The Outsiders&quot; by S. E. Hinton including the film adaptation by Francis Ford Coppola.

The company&#x27;s stores are operated under several brands, all bearing the Dairy Queen logo and carrying the company&#x27;s signature soft-serve. &quot;Brazier&quot; locations, with expanded food menus and second floors for storage, are recognizable by their red mansard roofs.

By the end of 2014, Dairy Queen had more than 6,400 stores in 27 countries, including more than 1,400 outside the United States and Canada.

The largest Dairy Queen in the US is in Bloomington, Illinois. The largest in the world is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

=== Standard stores ===

While some stores serve a very abbreviated menu primarily featuring DQ frozen treats and may be open only during spring, summer, and fall, most DQ restaurants also serve hot food and are open all year. 

So-called &quot;Limited Brazier&quot; locations may additionally offer hot dogs, barbecue beef (or pork) sandwiches, and in some cases french fries and chicken, but not hamburgers. Dairy Queen Full Brazier restaurants serve a typical fast-food menu featuring burgers, french fries, grilled and crispy chicken, frozen treats, and hot dogs.

In some locations built in the 1990s, the &quot;Hot Eats, Cool Treats&quot; slogan can be seen printed on windows or near the roof of the building. One such example was a former Dairy Queen Brazier location in Woodinville, Washington, where the slogan was printed near the tops of the windows. This location was converted into a Grill &amp; Chill store around late 2016–2017.

=== Franchise background ===
The liquid capital required to invest in a Dairy Queen franchise is $400,000, and a minimum net worth is $750,000. The initial franchise fee is $45,000, while the total investment amount required ranges from $1.1 million to $1.8 million. There are 5,700 operating Dairy Queen units. In addition to the upfront investment costs, the royalty fee for Dairy Queen franchisees is 4%, and the advertisement royalty fee is 5-6%. The franchise term of agreement lasts for 20 years, and the contract is renewable.

Dairy Queen does not offer in-house financing options; they only provide third-party financing. This third-party financing covers the franchise fee, startup costs, equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, and payroll.

=== DQ / Orange Julius ===
They were also known as the &quot;Treat Center&quot; concept, an enhanced version of the original stores also serves drinks and foods from the Orange Julius menu. This was the company&#x27;s preferred concept for new, small-scale locations, primarily in shopping malls food courts. Some early Treat Centers also included Karmelkorn.

=== Dairy Queen Brazier ===
The name &quot;Brazier&quot; originated in 1957 when one of the company&#x27;s franchisees, Jim Cruikshank, set out to develop the standardized food system. When he witnessed flames rising from an open charcoal grill (a brazier) in a New York eatery, he knew he had found the Brazier concept.

The &quot;Brazier&quot; name has been slowly phased out of signage and advertising since 1993, although it has not been removed from all existing signage, especially in smaller towns and rural locations. Since the early 2000s, new or renovated locations which are similar to Brazier restaurants in terms of size and menu selection, but have been updated with the current logo or exterior, usually carry the name &quot;DQ Restaurant,&quot; although the website&#x27;s store locator still lists the stores that do not carry the &quot;Grill &amp; Chill&quot; name as &quot;Dairy Queen Brazier&quot; and the smaller stores &quot;Dairy Queen Ltd Brazier&quot; and &quot;Dairy Queen Store.&quot;

The company website still considers its burger and hot dog lines as &quot;Brazier Foods,&quot; according to the history section and some FAQ listed topics on the website.

=== DQ Grill &amp; Chill ===

DQ Grill &amp; Chill locations feature hot food, treats, table delivery, and self-serve soft drinks. It is the new concept for new and renovated full-service restaurants. Stores are larger than older-style locations and feature a completely new store design. They usually offer an expanded menu, including breakfast, GrillBurgers, grilled sandwiches, and limited table service (customers still place orders at the counter). They also contain self-serve soft drink fountains allowing free refills. Some of the older stores have upgraded to the new format. However, older stores still have not upgraded to the new format. In December 2001, Chattanooga, Tennessee, was the site of the first two Dairy Queen Grill and Chill restaurants in the United States. The nation&#x27;s largest DQ Grill &amp; Chill is located in Bloomington, Illinois. In 2023, a Grill &amp; Chill location in Phoenix, Arizona had a large red spoon statue stolen from the front of the restaurant. The spoon was discovered three days later and returned. The spoon had been dumped on a baseball field next to a Phoenix middle school.

=== Texas Country Foods ===

All Texas locations, including those that otherwise resemble the Brazier or DQ Grill &amp; Chill formats, use a separate hot food menu branded as &quot;Texas Country Foods&quot;. Among other differences, &quot;Hungr-Buster&quot; burgers are available instead of the Brazier and GrillBurger offerings. Other food offerings not found outside Texas include the &quot;Dude&quot; chicken-fried steak sandwich, steak finger country baskets, T-Brand tacos, and a one-half pound double meat hamburger, the &quot;BeltBuster.&quot;

Texas is home to the largest number of Dairy Queens in the U.S. All Texas Dairy Queen restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees. The Texas Dairy Queen Operators&#x27; Council (TDQOC) runs a separate marketing website from the national website. Bob Phillips, host of the popular Texas syndicated television series &quot;Texas Country Reporter&quot;, was for many years the DQ spokesman in Texas, as the restaurant was a co-sponsor of the program at the time.

== Products ==
The company&#x27;s products expanded to include malts and milkshakes in 1950, banana splits in 1951, &quot;Dilly Bars&quot; in 1955 (introduced to the franchise by Robert Litherland, the co-owner of a store in Moorhead, Minnesota), a range of hamburgers and other cooked foods under the &quot;Brazier&quot; banner in 1958, &quot;Mr. Misty&quot; slush treats in 1961 (later renamed &quot;Misty Slush&quot;, then again to &quot;Arctic Rush&quot;; as of 2017, DQ again calls them Misty Slush, as seen on dairyqueen.com), and Jets, Curly Tops, Freezes in 1964. In 1962, the Buster Bar, consisting of vanilla soft serve in the shape of a small cup with a layer of and covered with peanuts and chocolate, was invented by David Skjerven in Grafton, North Dakota. In 1971, the Peanut Buster Parfait, consisting of peanuts, hot fudge, and vanilla soft serve, was introduced by Forrest &#x27;Frosty&#x27; Chapman in his St. Peter, Minnesota Franchise. In 1990, the Breeze, a dessert like a Blizzard but was made with non-fat, cholesterol-free yogurt, was launched. This was pulled from stores in 2000. In 1995, the Chicken Strip Basket was introduced, consisting of chicken strips, Texas toast (only in the US), fries, and cream gravy (gravy in Canada). Other items include sundaes and the blended coffee drink, the MooLatte. Another sundae made by Dairy Queen is the peanut buster parfait, thoroughly enjoyed and invented by Patsy Franks in 1969.

DQ does not use the term &quot;ice cream&quot; in reference to its frozen dairy products. Federal Food and Drug Administration labeling regulations for ice cream require a minimum standard of 10% butterfat content and DQ&#x27;s soft serve only contains 5% butterfat.

In Northwest Washington State, Dairy Queen chicken strip trays include chicken strips, a sauce, and french fries. Small bread slices coated in butter come with the dish/box. Chocolate shakes come in cups with an open top, and they are topped with whipped cream.

=== Blizzard ===

A popular Dairy Queen item is the Blizzard, which is soft-serve mechanically blended with mix-in ingredients such as sundae toppings and/or pieces of cookies, brownies, or candy. It has been a staple on the menu since its introduction in 1985, a year in which Dairy Queen sold more than 100 million Blizzards. Popular flavors include Oreo cookies, mint Oreo, chocolate chip cookie dough, M&amp;M&#x27;s, Reese&#x27;s Peanut Butter Cups, Heath Bar (Skor in Canada), and Butterfinger (Crispy Crunch in Canada). In Canada, a Smarties Blizzard is also available; it was temporarily discontinued in 2015 but re-added to the menu in 2018. Seasonal flavors are also available such as October&#x27;s pumpkin pie and June&#x27;s cotton candy. It has been argued that Dairy Queen drew its inspiration from the &quot;concrete&quot; served by the St. Louis-based Ted Drewes. On July 26, 2010, Dairy Queen introduced a new &quot;mini&quot; size Blizzard, served in 6 oz. cups. During the 25th anniversary of the Blizzard, two special flavors were released: Strawberry Golden Oreo Blizzard and Buster Bar Blizzard. Salted Caramel Truffle was released in 2015 during the Blizzard&#x27;s 30th anniversary and Dairy Queen&#x27;s 75th anniversary, but it has since been removed from the menu. Dairy Queen has featured over 170 different Blizzard flavors since its introduction in 1985.

Blizzards derive their name from being so thoroughly cold and thick that the cup can be held upside down after serving without any of the contents falling out. Employees will frequently demonstrate this to customers. There is a company policy that one Blizzard per order will be flipped upside-down by the employee. If this does not occur, the customer may request a coupon for a free Blizzard to use on their next visit, though this is at the franchise owner&#x27;s discretion.

Dairy Queen had served conventional &quot;thick&quot; milkshakes called &quot;Blizzards&quot; in the 1960s. This time period also introduced the contemporary custom of flipping the shake upside down when served to the customer. Selling for the premium price of 50 cents in 1962, the original &quot;Blizzards&quot; invented by Samuel Temperato were available in traditional flavors such as vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, with added malt on request.

In addition, Dairy Queen offers a Blizzard Cake in flavors such as Oreo and Reese&#x27;s. Much like the restaurant&#x27;s conventional &quot;DQ cake&quot;, this variation is aimed toward celebrations and birthdays.

=== Frozen yogurt ===
In 1990, Dairy Queen began offering frozen yogurt as a lower-calorie alternative to its soft serve. The product was named Breeze. According to a company representative, Dairy Queen&#x27;s regular soft serve has 35 calories per ounce, whereas the frozen yogurt was 25 calories per ounce. However, in 2001, the company phased out the frozen yogurt option in all its stores, citing a lack of demand.

In 2011, International Dairy Queen Inc. filed a request for a preliminary injunction to stop Yogubliz Inc, a small California-based frozen yogurt chain, from selling &quot;Blizzberry&quot; and &quot;Blizz Frozen Yogurt,&quot; alleging that the names could confuse consumers due to their similarity to Dairy Queen&#x27;s Blizzard. U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner denied Dairy Queen&#x27;s request.

=== Cage-free egg commitment ===
In May 2016, Dairy Queen committed to requiring suppliers in the United States and Canada to purchase eggs only from approved cage-free egg suppliers by 2025. In the U.S., 67 percent of shell eggs, liquid eggs, and proprietary DQ ingredients that contain eggs have either converted to cage-free or were reformulated to remove eggs as an ingredient since Dairy Queen made their commitment. In Canada, 39 percent of shell eggs, liquid eggs, and proprietary DQ ingredients that contain eggs have either converted to cage-free or were reformulated to remove eggs as an ingredient since Dairy Queen made their commitment.

Some consider cage-free egg production to be a more humane method of production than conventional methods representing the majority of current production in the United States and Canada. There is no mention of Dairy Queen&#x27;s cage-free commitment in their restaurants outside of the US and Canada.

==Advertising==
&quot;Little Miss Dairy Queen&quot; began appearing in Pennsylvania signage in 1961. She had a Dutch bonnet, resembling the ellipse logo, with a pinafore apron over her dress and wooden shoes.

Dennis the Menace appeared in Dairy Queen marketing from 1971 until December 2002, when he was dropped because Dairy Queen felt children could no longer relate to him. From 2006 to July 2011, the advertising focused on a large mouth with its tongue licking its large lips, which morphs into the Dairy Queen logo. The mouth was dropped in 2011 after Grey New York produced outlandish spots featuring a dapper man, played by John Behlmann, sporting a mustache, performing crazy feats for Dairy Queen replacing it. After announcing tasty menu offers, he would do something outrageous, like blow bubbles with kittens in them, water ski while boxing, or break a piñata, out of which tumbles Olympic gymnastics great Mary Lou Retton. Later, the same firm made additional commercials based around odd situation titles with the DQ logo placed somewhere in them, like &quot;Gary DQlones Himself,&quot; &quot;Now That&#x27;s A Lunchtime DQuandary!,&quot; &quot;After The DQonquest,&quot; and &quot;Well, This Is A Bit DQrazy!&quot; All were narrated by a man with an English accent.

In Texas, at the end of advertisements, there is frequently a Texas flag waving, and the new DQ logo and slogan below saying, &quot;Eat Like A Texan.&quot; Previous slogans include &quot;That&#x27;s what I like about Texas,&quot; &quot;For Hot Eats &amp; Cool Treats, Think DQ,&quot; &quot;Nobody beats DQ Treats &amp; Eats,&quot; &quot;DQ is Value Country,&quot; and &quot;This is DQ Country.&quot; These advertisements featured &quot;Texas Country Reporter&quot; host Bob Phillips as a spokesperson since his program was mainly sponsored by Dairy Queen. Early 1990s Dairy Queen Texas advertisements included a group of animal mascot characters called the Fun Bunch Munch, which included Kangachew the kangaroo, Hungrizzly the bear, and Chompanzee the chimpanzee, to advertise children&#x27;s meals.

In 2015, Dairy Queen and model railroad company of Milwaukee, Wm. K. Walthers came out with a Walthers Cornerstone HO 1:87 Scale models of a restaurant – one from the 1950s with the original logo and one from 2007 with the current logo. The models are both officially licensed replicas.

===Slogans===
From 1979 until 1981, the restaurant chain used the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s a real treat!&quot; For many years, the franchise&#x27;s slogan was &quot;We treat you right.&quot; From the early-to-mid 1990s, the slogans &quot;Hot Eats, Cool Treats&quot; and &quot;Think DQ&quot; were used and preceded the aforementioned line in the Dairy Queen jingle. Later on, it was changed to &quot;Meet Me at DQ&quot; and &quot;DQ: Something Different.&quot; Another slogan, introduced in early 2011, was &quot;So Good It&#x27;s RiDQulous,&quot; with Dairy Queen&#x27;s current logo infused in the word &quot;ridiculous.&quot; In the mid-to-late 2010s, their slogan was &quot;Fan Food, Not Fast Food.&quot; As of April 2019, Dairy Queen uses the slogan &quot;Happy Tastes Good.&quot; The slogan &quot;This is Fan Food not Fast Food&quot; was still used on the cups, wrappers, and paper baskets for a while. In Texas, the slogan &quot;That&#x27;s What I Like about Texas&quot; is used.

===Logos===

The original Dairy Queen logo was simply a stylized text sign with a soft-serve cone at one end. In the late 1950s, the widely recognized red ellipse design was adopted. The initial shape was asymmetrical, with one of the side points having a greater extension than the other, especially when matched with the Brazier sign—a similarly sized yellow ovoid, tucked diagonally below its companion. By the 1970s, both sides were more closely matched, becoming symmetrical with the 2007 update (see online images for comparison). Some of the new 1950s signs continued to display a soft-serve cone jutting from the right side.

A yellow trapezoid Brazier sign, placed below the red Dairy Queen logo, was developed in the late 1960s. It matched the roofline of the new store design of the era.

The 1990s saw a new style of design, boxier with red strips containing the &quot;Hot Eats, Cool Treats&quot; slogan of the era near the roofline (some stores have removed this); straddling the center of the facade was a large blue sign that was a modernized take on the soft-serve cone design of the early 1950s, with white and red pinstripes trailing out from beneath the full Dairy Queen name, underneath the cone; the cone itself was now facing the building, to accommodate the physical ellipse logo; the sign continued further down the wall, with an angle and a &quot;Brazier&quot; logo strip. Additional cone signs were used to mark the entrance and exit of the store for drivers. This design was largely used on new stores but was sometimes used for remodeling older locations.

Although it had been used interchangeably with the Dairy Queen name for many decades, &quot;DQ&quot; became the company&#x27;s official name in 2001. The font remained the same as in the original signage introduced 60 years prior. Throughout this period, the company placed the registered mark symbol immediately to the right, on the bottom side of the logo. When the company modernized its signage and logos in early 2007, it modified the font and italicized the letters, as well as adding arced lines, an orange one to represent its hot foods above and a blue one below to represent its soft serve products. In the new design, the registered mark symbol was moved to be adjacent to the letter &quot;Q.&quot; The first overhaul of its logo in almost 70 years, the company claimed that the new logo would show brand growth and reflect the &quot;fun and enjoyment&quot; associated with its products. Advertising industry observers have noted that the new logo was an unneeded update of a known and trusted industry brand and that its new features were distracting.

The original signage is still in use in older locations or in locations that use a &quot;retro&quot; motif in the property&#x27;s design.

<doc id="379733" wikidata="Q912925" url="?curid=379733" title="Great-circle distance">
<text>The great-circle distance, orthodromic distance, or spherical distance is the distance between two points on a sphere, measured along the great-circle arc between them. This arc is the shortest path between the two points on the surface of the sphere. (By comparison, the shortest path passing through the sphere&#x27;s interior is the chord between the points.)

On a curved surface, the concept of straight lines is replaced by a more general concept of geodesics, curves which are locally straight with respect to the surface. Geodesics on the sphere are great circles, circles whose center coincides with the center of the sphere.

Any two distinct points on a sphere that are not antipodal (diametrically opposite) both lie on a unique great circle, which the points separate into two arcs; the length of the shorter arc is the great-circle distance between the points. This arc length is proportional to the central angle between the points, which if measured in radians can be scaled up by the sphere&#x27;s radius to obtain the arc length. Two antipodal points both lie on infinitely many great circles, each of which they divide into two arcs of length  times the radius.

The determination of the great-circle distance is part of the more general problem of great-circle navigation, which also computes the azimuths at the end points and intermediate way-points. Because the Earth is nearly spherical, great-circle distance formulas applied to longitude and geodetic latitude of points on Earth are accurate to within about 0.5%.

== Formulae ==
Let formula_1 and formula_2 be the geographical longitude and latitude of two points 1 and 2, and formula_3 be their absolute differences; then formula_4, the central angle between them, is given by the spherical law of cosines if one of the poles is used as an auxiliary third point on the sphere:

:formula_5

The problem is normally expressed in terms of finding the central angle formula_4. Given this angle in radians, the actual arc length &quot;d&quot; on a sphere of radius &quot;r&quot; can be trivially computed as
:formula_7

== Relation between central angle and chord length ==
The central angle formula_4 is related with the chord length of unit sphere formula_9:
:formula_10

For short-distance approximation (formula_11),
:formula_12

===Computational formulae===
On computer systems with low floating point precision, the spherical law of cosines formula can have large rounding errors if the distance is small (if the two points are a kilometer apart on the surface of the Earth, the cosine of the central angle is near 0.99999999). For modern 64-bit floating-point numbers, the spherical law of cosines formula, given above, does not have serious rounding errors for distances larger than a few meters on the surface of the Earth. The haversine formula is numerically better-conditioned for small distances by using the chord-length relation:

:formula_13

Historically, the use of this formula was simplified by the availability of tables for the haversine function: formula_14 and formula_15.

The following shows the equivalent formula expressing the chord length explicitly:
:formula_16
where formula_17.

Although this formula is accurate for most distances on a sphere, it too suffers from rounding errors for the special (and somewhat unusual) case of antipodal points. A formula that is accurate for all distances is the following special case of the Vincenty formula for an ellipsoid with equal major and minor axes:

:formula_18

where is the two-argument arctangent. Using atan2 ensures that the correct quadrant is chosen.

=== Vector version ===
Another representation of similar formulas, but using normal vectors instead of latitude and longitude to describe the positions, is found by means of 3D vector algebra, using the dot product, cross product, or a combination:

:formula_19

where formula_20 and formula_21 are the normals to the sphere at the two positions 1 and 2. Similarly to the equations above based on latitude and longitude, the expression based on arctan is the only one that is well-conditioned for all angles. The expression based on arctan requires the magnitude of the cross product over the dot product.

=== From chord length ===
A line through three-dimensional space between points of interest on a spherical Earth is the chord of the great circle between the points. The central angle between the two points can be determined from the chord length. The great circle distance is proportional to the central angle.

The great circle chord length, formula_9, may be calculated as follows for the corresponding unit sphere, by means of Cartesian subtraction:
:formula_23

Substituting formula_24 and formula_25 this formula can be algebraically manipulated to the form shown above in .

==Radius for spherical Earth==
The shape of the Earth closely resembles a flattened sphere (a spheroid) with equatorial radius formula_26 of 6378.137 km; distance formula_27 from the center of the spheroid to each pole is 6356.7523142 km. When calculating the length of a short north-south line at the equator, the circle that best approximates that line has a radius of formula_28 (which equals the meridian&#x27;s semi-latus rectum), or 6335.439 km, while the spheroid at the poles is best approximated by a sphere of radius formula_29, or 6399.594 km, a 1% difference. So long as a spherical Earth is assumed, any single formula for distance on the Earth is only guaranteed correct within 0.5% (though better accuracy is possible if the formula is only intended to apply to a limited area). Using the mean Earth radius, formula_30 (for the WGS84 ellipsoid) means that in the limit of small flattening, the mean square relative error in the estimates for distance is minimized.

For distances smaller than 500 kilometers and outside of the poles, a Euclidean approximation of an ellipsoidal Earth (Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s (FCC)&#x27;s formula) is both simpler and more accurate (to 0.1%).

<text>The Kelowna Falcons are a collegiate summer baseball team located in Kelowna, British Columbia. The Falcons are members of the West Coast League and play their home games at Elks Stadium.

==History==
The franchise traces its roots back to the Kelowna Grizzlies, who were founded in 1993. The Grizzlies were members of the Pacific International League. During their tenure the Grizzlies won the 1995 league championship. Following the 1998 the club suspended operations. The franchise was sold in 2000 and rebranded as the Falcons. Kelowna continued this membership with the Pacific International League playing from 2000 through 2004. In 2005, the Falcons along with Bellingham, Bend, Spokane, and Wenatchee left the league to form the West Coast Collegiate Baseball League (WCCBL).

===2010===
The Falcons finished second in the East Division with a 22-26 record. Pitcher Dayne Quist lead the league with an ERA of 1.40 and finished with 50 strikeouts and six wins on the mound. Ben Edlestein finished with a batting average of .347. 16,027 fans attended games for an average of 668 per game.

The Falcons were swept in the Division Series by the AppleSox 0-2. 1,132 total fans attended Kelowna&#x27;s only home game in the playoffs.

===2022 season===
The Falcons failed to make it to the postseason for the second straight season, finishing seventh in the north division with a record of 20-33, 13 games behind the division winning Bellingham Bells. The Falcons saw 22,722 total fans for an average of 947 per game. Jasper Nelson (Sacramento State) and Nick Woodcock (Yavapai College) received honorable mentions in the All-WCL team after the season.

===2023 season===
On July 17, Koen Van&#x27;t Klooster was named pitcher of the week.

The Falcons finished fourth in the north division. The team averaged 1,064 fans per game, below the league average.

===2024===
On July 9th, Trey Duffield and Gavyn Jones were selected to represent the Falcons in the All Star Game.

The Falcons failed to improve on their 31-23 record from the previous season, posting a 20-34 record and finishing sixth in the north division, 15 games behind the division leading AppleSox. 23,776 fans attended home games for an average of 914 per game.

The Falcons failed to make the postseason.

<doc id="379736" wikidata="Q221499" url="?curid=379736" title="TRIAC">
<text>A TRIAC (triode for alternating current; also bidirectional triode thyristor or bilateral triode thyristor) is a three-terminal electronic component that conducts current in either direction when triggered. The term TRIAC is a genericised trademark.

TRIACs are a subset of thyristors (analogous to a relay in that a small voltage and current can control a much larger voltage and current) and are related to silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs). TRIACs differ from SCRs in that they allow current flow in both directions, whereas an SCR can only conduct current in a single direction. Most TRIACs can be triggered by applying either a positive or negative voltage to the gate (an SCR requires a positive voltage). Once triggered, SCRs and TRIACs continue to conduct, even if the gate current ceases, until the main current drops below a certain level called the holding current.

Gate turn-off thyristors (GTOs) are similar to TRIACs but provide more control by turning off when the gate signal ceases.

The bidirectionality of TRIACs makes them convenient switches for alternating-current (AC). In addition, applying a trigger at a controlled phase angle of the AC in the main circuit allows control of the average current flowing into a load (phase control). This is commonly used for controlling the speed of a universal motor, dimming lamps, and controlling electric heaters. TRIACs are Bipolar devices.

==Operation==
To understand how TRIACs work, consider the triggering in each of the four possible combinations of gate and MT2 voltages with respect to MT1. The four separate cases (quadrants) are illustrated in Figure 1. Main Terminal 1 (MT1) and Main Terminal 2 (MT2) are also referred to as Anode 1 (A1) and Anode 2 (A2) respectively.

The relative sensitivity depends on the physical structure of a particular triac, but as a rule, quadrant I is the most sensitive (least gate current required), and quadrant 4 is the least sensitive (most gate current required).

In quadrants 1 and 2, MT2 is positive, and current flows from MT2 to MT1 through P, N, P and N layers. The N region attached to MT2 does not participate significantly. In quadrants 3 and 4, MT2 is negative, and current flows from MT1 to MT2, also through P, N, P and N layers. The N region attached to MT2 is active, but the N region attached to MT1 only participates in the initial triggering, not the bulk current flow.

In most applications, the gate current comes from MT2, so quadrants 1 and 3 are the only operating modes (both gate and MT2 positive or negative against MT1). Other applications with single polarity triggering from an IC or digital drive circuit operate in quadrants 2 and 3, where MT1 is usually connected to positive voltage (e.g. +5V) and gate is pulled down to 0V (ground).

=== Quadrant 1 ===
Quadrant 1 operation occurs when the gate and MT2 are positive with respect to MT1.Figure 1

The mechanism is illustrated in Figure 3. The gate current makes an equivalent NPN transistor switch on, which in turn draws current from the base of an equivalent PNP transistor, turning it on also. Part of the gate current (dotted line) is lost through the ohmic path across the p-silicon, flowing directly into MT1 without passing through the NPN transistor base. In this case, the injection of holes in the p-silicon makes the stacked n, p and n layers beneath MT1 behave like a NPN transistor, which turns on due to the presence of a current in its base. This, in turn, causes the p, n and p layers over MT2 to behave like a PNP transistor, which turns on because its n-type base becomes forward-biased with respect to its emitter (MT2). Thus, the triggering scheme is the same as an SCR. The equivalent circuit is depicted in Figure 4.

However, the structure is different from SCRs. In particular, TRIAC always has a small current flowing directly from the gate to MT1 through the p-silicon without passing through the p-n junction between the base and the emitter of the equivalent NPN transistor. This current is indicated in Figure 3 by a dotted red line and is the reason why a TRIAC needs more gate current to turn on than a comparably rated SCR.

Generally, this quadrant is the most sensitive of the four. This is because it is the only quadrant where gate current is injected directly into the base of one of the main device transistors.

===Quadrant 2===
Quadrant 2 operation occurs when the gate is negative and MT2 is positive with respect to MT1.Figure 1

Figure 5 shows the triggering process. The turn-on of the device is three-fold and starts when the current from MT1 flows into the gate through the p-n junction under the gate. This switches on a structure composed by an NPN transistor and a PNP transistor, which has the gate as cathode (the turn-on of this structure is indicated by &quot;1&quot; in the figure). As current into the gate increases, the potential of the left side of the p-silicon under the gate rises towards MT1, since the difference in potential between the gate and MT2 tends to lower: this establishes a current between the left side and the right side of the p-silicon (indicated by &quot;2&quot; in the figure), which in turn switches on the NPN transistor under the MT1 terminal and as a consequence also the pnp transistor between MT2 and the right side of the upper p-silicon. So, in the end, the structure which is crossed by the major portion of the current is the same as quadrant-I operation (&quot;3&quot; in Figure 5).

===Quadrant 3===
Quadrant 3 operation occurs when the gate and MT2 are negative with respect to MT1.Figure 1

The whole process is outlined in Figure 6. The process happens in different steps here too. In the first phase, the pn junction between the MT1 terminal and the gate becomes forward-biased (step 1). As forward-biasing implies the injection of minority carriers in the two layers joining the junction, electrons are injected in the p-layer under the gate. Some of these electrons do not recombine and escape to the underlying n-region (step 2). This in turn lowers the potential of the n-region, acting as the base of a pnp transistor which switches on (turning the transistor on without directly lowering the base potential is called remote gate control). The lower p-layer works as the collector of this PNP transistor and has its voltage heightened: this p-layer also acts as the base of an NPN transistor made up by the last three layers just over the MT2 terminal, which, in turn, gets activated. Therefore, the red arrow labeled with a &quot;3&quot; in Figure 6 shows the final conduction path of the current.

===Quadrant 4===
Quadrant 4 operation occurs when the gate is positive and MT2 is negative with respect to MT1. Figure 1

Triggering in this quadrant is similar to triggering in quadrant III. The process uses a remote gate control and is illustrated in Figure 7. As current flows from the p-layer under the gate into the n-layer under MT1, minority carriers in the form of free electrons are injected into the p-region and some of them are collected by the underlying n-p junction and pass into the adjoining n-region without recombining. As in the case of a triggering in quadrant III, this lowers the potential of the n-layer and turns on the PNP transistor formed by the n-layer and the two p-layers next to it. The lower p-layer works as the collector of this PNP transistor and has its voltage heightened: this p-layer also acts as the base of an NPN transistor made up by the last three layers just over the MT2 terminal, which, in turn, gets activated. Therefore, the red arrow labeled with a &quot;3&quot; in Figure 6 shows the final conduction path of the current.

Generally, this quadrant is the least sensitive of the four. In addition, some models of TRIACs (three-quadrant high commutation triacs named by different suppliers as &quot;logic level&quot;, &quot;snubberless&quot; or &quot;Hi-Com&quot; types) cannot be triggered in this quadrant but only in the other three.

== Issues ==

There are some limitations one should know when using a TRIAC in a circuit. In this section, a few are summarized.

===Gate threshold current, latching current, and holding current===

A TRIAC starts conducting when a current flowing into or out of its gate is sufficient to turn on the relevant junctions in the quadrant of operation. The minimum current able to do this is called gate threshold current and is generally indicated by IGT. In a typical TRIAC, the gate threshold current is generally a few milliamperes, but one has to take into account also that:

* IGT depends on the temperature: The higher the temperature, the higher the reverse currents in the blocked junctions. This implies the presence of more free carriers in the gate region, which lowers the gate current needed.
* IGT depends on the quadrant of operation, because a different quadrant implies a different way of triggering (see here). As a rule, the first quadrant is the most sensitive (i.e. requires the least current to turn on), whereas the fourth quadrant is the least sensitive.
* When turning on from the off state, IGT depends on the voltage across the two main terminals MT1 and MT2. Higher voltage between MT1 and MT2 cause greater reverse currents in the blocked junctions, thus requiring less gate current to trigger the device (similar to high temperature operation). In datasheets IGT is generally given for a specified voltage between MT1 and MT2.

When the gate current is discontinued, if the current between the two main terminals is more than what is called the latching current, the device continues to conduct. Latching current is the minimum current that keeps the device internal structure latched in the absence of gate current. The value of this parameter varies with:

* gate current pulse (amplitude, shape and width)
* temperature 
* quadrant of operation

In particular, if the pulse width of the gate current is sufficiently large (generally some tens of microseconds), the TRIAC has completed the triggering process when the gate signal is discontinued and the latching current reaches a minimum level called holding current. Holding current is the minimum required current flowing between the two main terminals that keeps the device on after it has achieved commutation in every part of its internal structure.

In datasheets, the latching current is indicated as IL, while the holding current is indicated as IH. They are typically in the order of some milliamperes.

=== Static dv/dt ===
A high formula_1 between MT2 and MT1 may turn on the TRIAC when it is off. Typical values of critical static d&quot;v&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; are in the terms of volts per microsecond.

The turn-on is due to a parasitic capacitive coupling of the gate terminal with the MT2 terminal, which lets currents into the gate in response to a large rate of voltage change at MT2. One way to cope with this limitation is to design a suitable RC or RCL snubber network. In many cases this is sufficient to lower the impedance of the gate towards MT1. By putting a resistor or a small capacitor (or both in parallel) between these two terminals, the capacitive current generated during the transient flows out of the device without activating it. A careful reading of the application notes provided by the manufacturer and testing of the particular device model to design the correct network is in order. Typical values for capacitors and resistors between the gate and MT1 may be up to 100 nF and 10 Ω to 1 kΩ. Normal TRIACs, except for low-power types marketed as &quot;sensitive gate&quot;, already have such a resistor built in to safeguard against spurious dv/dt triggering. This will mask the gate&#x27;s supposed diode-type behaviour when testing a TRIAC with a multimeter.

In datasheets, the static d&quot;v&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; is usually indicated as formula_2 and, as mentioned before, is in relation to the tendency of a TRIAC to turn on &quot;from the off state&quot; after a large voltage rate of rise even without applying any current in the gate.

===Critical di/dt===
A high rate of rise of the current between MT1 and MT2 (in either direction) &quot;when the device is turning on&quot; can damage or destroy the TRIAC even if the pulse duration is very short. The reason is that during the commutation, the power dissipation is not uniformly distributed across the device. When switching on, the device starts to conduct current before the conduction finishes to spread across the entire junction. The device typically starts to conduct the current imposed by the external circuitry after some nanoseconds or microseconds but the complete switch on of the whole junction takes a much longer time, so too swift a current rise may cause local hot spots that can permanently damage the TRIAC.

In datasheets, this parameter is usually indicated as formula_3 and is typically in the order of the tens of ampere per microsecond.

===Commutating dv/dt and di/dt===
The commutating d&quot;v&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; rating applies when a TRIAC has been conducting and attempts to turn off with a partially reactive load, such as an inductor. The current and voltage are out of phase, so when the current decreases below the holding value, the TRIAC attempts to turn off, but because of the phase shift between current and voltage, a sudden voltage step takes place between the two main terminals, which turns the device on again.

In datasheets, this parameter is usually indicated as formula_4 and is generally in the order of up to some volts per microsecond.

The reason why &quot;commutating dv/dt is less than static dv/dt&quot; is that, shortly before the device tries to turn off, there is still some excess minority charge in its internal layers as a result of the previous conduction. When the TRIAC starts to turn off, these charges alter the internal potential of the region near the gate and MT1, so it is easier for the capacitive current due to d&quot;v&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; to turn on the device again.

Another important factor during a commutation from on-state to off-state is the d&quot;i&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; of the current from MT1 to MT2. This is similar to the recovery in standard diodes: the higher the d&quot;i&quot;/d&quot;t&quot;, the greater the reverse current. Because in the TRIAC there are parasitic resistances, a high reverse current in the p-n junctions inside it can provoke a voltage drop between the gate region and the MT1 region which may make the TRIAC stay turned on.

In a datasheet, the commutating d&quot;i&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; is usually indicated as formula_5 and is generally in the order of some amperes per microsecond.

The commutating d&quot;v&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; is very important when the TRIAC is used to drive a load with a phase shift between current and voltage, such as an inductive load. Suppose one wants to turn the inductor off: when the current goes to zero, if the gate is not fed, the TRIAC attempts to turn off, but this causes a step in the voltage across it due to the aforementioned phase shift. If the commutating d&quot;v&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; rating is exceeded, the device will not turn off.

==Snubber circuits==
When used to control reactive (inductive or capacitive) loads, care must be taken to ensure that the TRIAC turns off correctly at the end of each half-cycle of the AC in the main circuit. TRIACs can be sensitive to fast voltage changes (dv/dt) between MT1 and MT2, so a phase shift between current and voltage caused by reactive loads can lead to a voltage step that can turn the thyristor on erroneously. An electric motor is typically an inductive load and off-line power supplies—as used in most TVs and computers—are capacitive.

Unwanted turn-ons can be avoided by using a snubber circuit (usually of the resistor/capacitor or resistor/capacitor/inductor type) between MT1 and MT2. Snubber circuits are also used to prevent premature triggering, caused for example by voltage spikes in the mains supply.

Because turn-ons are caused by internal capacitive currents flowing into the gate as a consequence of a high d&quot;v&quot;/d&quot;t&quot;, (i.e., rapid voltage change) a gate resistor or capacitor (or both in parallel) may be connected between the gate and MT1 to provide a low-impedance path to MT1 and further prevent false triggering. This, however, increases the required trigger current or adds latency due to capacitor charging. On the other hand, a resistor between the gate and MT1 helps draw leakage currents out of the device, thus improving the performance of the TRIAC at high temperature, where the maximum allowed d&quot;v&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; is lower. Values of resistors less than 1kΩ and capacitors of 100nF are generally suitable for this purpose, although the fine-tuning should be done on the particular device model.

For higher-powered, more-demanding loads, two SCRs in inverse parallel may be used instead of one TRIAC. Because each SCR will have an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity voltage applied to it, turn-off of the SCRs is assured, no matter what the character of the load. However, due to the separate gates, proper triggering of the SCRs is more complex than triggering a TRIAC.

TRIACs may also fail to turn on reliably with reactive loads if the current phase shift causes the main circuit current to be below the holding current at trigger time. To overcome the problem DC or a pulse train may be used to repeatedly trigger the TRIAC until it turns on.

==Application==

Low-power TRIACs are used in many applications such as light dimmers, speed controls for electric fans and other electric motors, and in the modern computerized control circuits of many household small and major appliances.

When mains voltage TRIACs are triggered by microcontrollers, optoisolators are frequently used; for example optotriacs can be used to control the gate current. Alternatively, where safety allows and electrical isolation of the controller isn&#x27;t necessary, one of the microcontroller&#x27;s power rails may be connected to one of the mains supply. In these situations it is normal to connect the neutral terminal to the positive rail of the microcontroller&#x27;s power supply, together with A1 of the triac, with A2 connected to the live. The TRIAC&#x27;s gate can be connected through an opto-isolated transistor, and sometimes a resistor to the microcontroller, so that bringing the voltage down to the microcontroller&#x27;s logic zero pulls enough current through the TRIAC&#x27;s gate to trigger it. This ensures that the TRIAC is triggered in quadrants II and III and avoids quadrant IV where TRIACs are typically insensitive.

== Example data ==
==High commutation (two- and three-quadrant) TRIACs==
Three-quadrant TRIACs only operate in quadrants 1 through 3 and cannot be triggered in quadrant 4. These devices are made specifically for improved commutation and can often control reactive loads without the use of a snubber circuit.

The first TRIACs of this type were marketed by Thomson Semiconductors (now ST Microelectronics) under the name &quot;Alternistor&quot;. Later versions are sold under the trademark &quot;Snubberless&quot; and &quot;ACS&quot; (AC Switch, though this type also incorporates a gate buffer, which further precludes Quadrant I operation). Littelfuse also uses the name &quot;Alternistor&quot;. Philips Semiconductors (now NXP Semiconductors) originated the trademark &quot;Hi-Com&quot; (High Commutation).

Often these TRIACs can operate with smaller gate-current to be directly driven by logic level components.

<text>Magdalene Mary Therese Szubanski ( ; born 12 April 1961), known as Magda Szubanski, is an Australian comedy actress, author, singer and LGBT rights advocate. She performed in &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; as Sharon Strzelecki and in the films &quot;Babe&quot; (1995) and &quot;&quot; (1998), &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006) and &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; (2011). In 2003 and 2004 surveys, she polled as the most recognised and well-liked Australian television personality.

Szubanski has spoken openly about her struggles with intergenerational trauma, anxiety and suicidal ideation in her teens. She became an activist for LGBT rights and, in 2017, advocated for same-sex marriage in Australia. In 2015, Szubanski released her memoir, &quot;Reckoning&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Szubanski was born on 12 April 1961, in Liverpool, England. Her mother Margaret (née McCarthy) is Scottish-Irish and came from a poor family. Her father, Zbigniew Szubański, came from a well-off Polish family and was an assassin in a counter-intelligence branch of the Polish resistance movement in World War II. She is a cousin of Polish actress Magdalena Zawadzka.

She attended Siena College, Melbourne. In 1976, as a Year 10 student, she captained a team on the television quiz show &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot;. Szubanski studied fine arts and philosophy at the University of Melbourne and, decades later, in 2016, attained a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Arts (degree with honours).

==Career==
===Television===

Szubanski was a writer and performer of sketch comedy. In 1985, while performing in a University of Melbourne revue of &quot;Too Cool for Sandals&quot;, Szubanski, Michael Veitch, Tom Gleisner and others were talent-spotted by Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) producers, which led to &quot;The D-Generation&quot; television sketch comedy show.

Szubanski was one of the creators and performers of the &quot;Fast Forward&quot; television sketch comedy for the Seven Network, in which she played various characters, including Pixie-Anne Wheatley, Chenille from the Institute de Beauté, Wee Mary MacGregor, Joan Kirner, Michelle Grogan. The character of Lynne Postlethwaite was first performed on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;The D-Generation&quot;. It was originally written by John Allsop and Andrew Knight, but from &quot;Fast Forward&quot; on Szubanski co-wrote the sketches, and created and co-wrote her characters.

In 1995, she and friends Gina Riley and Jane Turner wrote, performed and produced the first all-female Australian sketch comedy television program; &quot;Big Girl&#x27;s Blouse&quot;. When Riley and Turner developed sketch-characters they had created into the sitcom &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;, Szubanski joined them to play Sharon Strzelecki, a character she had previously created. That same year, Szubanski hosted the 37th Australian Film Institute Awards.

In 1999, Szubanski created, wrote, co-produced and played Margaret O&#x27;Halloran in the &quot;Dogwoman&quot; series of TV films, a detective style show based on the idea an expert &quot;dog-whisperer&quot; who, by treating problem dogs, inadvertently stumbles upon and solves human crimes.

In 2009, she appeared on &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; where she explored her father&#x27;s Polish Resistance activities as well as the story of her shell-shocked Irish grandfather and her sculptor ancestor Luigi Isepponi who assisted in making the death mask for William Burke, half of the duo Burke and Hare, notorious grave robbers and serial killers.

From 3 September 2018, Szubanski recurred as Jemima Davies-Smythe on &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Her character officiated the first same-sex wedding on Australian television.

On 8 April 2019, she appeared as &quot;Guest Announcer&quot; on &quot;Chris &amp; Julia&#x27;s Sunday Night Takeaway&quot;&#x27;s season finale where she participated in a number of roles.

On 9 March 2021, Szubanski was announced as the host of the Nine Network&#x27;s revival of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. Initially due to premiere on 4 May 2021, it instead premiered on 25 May following a tight production schedule.

===Film===
Szubanski performed in the 1995 film &quot;Babe&quot; as Esme Hoggett. She reprised her role in the 1998 sequel, &quot;&quot;. She then teamed up again with director/producer George Miller to voice the role of Miss Viola in the animated films &quot;Happy Feet&quot; and &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot;.

In 2007, she had a minor role as Mrs Lonsdale, the housemaid in &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; to Lyra Belacqua.

===Musical theatre===
In 2007, Szubanski ventured into musical comedy, taking on the role of William Barfee in the Melbourne Theatre Company production of the hit Broadway musical &quot;The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described her performance as &quot;sensationally good&quot;. &quot;Australian Stage&quot; said, &quot;Magda Szubanski as the Eric Cartman-esque William Barfee steals the show.&quot;

In 2008, she again participated in some gender-blind casting, taking on the role of pint-sized gangster Big Jule in a major stage production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

In 2010, she appeared in the first Indigenous musical film &quot;Bran Nue Dae&quot; as Roadhouse Betty alongside Geoffrey Rush, Ernie Dingo, Missy Higgins and Deborah Mailman. The film was directed by Rachel Perkins, daughter of the Aboriginal activist Charlie Perkins.

In 2012, she again teamed with Rush to appear in the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;.

=== Art ===
In 2020, Szubanski was the painted subject of Wendy Sharpe&#x27;s Archibald Prize entry, a portrait painting competition held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. In Sharpe&#x27;s painting, &quot;Comedy and Tragedy&quot;, Szubanski is depicted as Sharon Strzelecki, standing amongst flaming buildings during an air raid.

The painting achieved finalist status in the competition; and in an interview with AGNSW, Sharpe commented:

&quot;&#x27;After an intense conversation with Magda in my Sydney studio, I decided to change my original concept for the portrait and painted her as a despairing version of her comic character/alter ego Sharon. Magda is haunted by her father&#x27;s traumatic experiences in World War II in the Polish resistance, and by current world events&quot;.&#x27; 

===Other projects===
In 2004, Szubanski advertised the airline Jetstar. Szubanski became a spokesperson for the dieting company Jenny Craig in November 2008. Szubanski joined Jenny Craig weighing 110 kg and had been diagnosed with sleep apnoea. By July 2009, she had lost 36 kg to weigh 85 kg. She later regained weight, then was dropped as a spokesperson for Jenny Craig. However, subsequent weight loss led to her being re-signed as their spokesperson. She was later again dropped from Jenny Craig. She was also featured in commercials for Telstra in 2014. In 2019, she appeared in an Uber Eats ad in her Sharon Strzelecki character with a &quot;Kim&quot;, referencing fellow &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; character Kim Craig, but who turns out to be Kim Kardashian.

===Memoir===
In 2015, Szubanski released a memoir, &quot;Reckoning&quot;, in large part about her father, Zbigniew Szubanski who was a World War 2 Polish Resistance assassin, and dealing with themes of intergenerational trauma, possible genetic inheritance of traumatic memory and Szubanski&#x27;s struggles with her own sexuality. The book won the TBA and $40,000 Douglas Stewart Prize for Nonfiction and &quot;Book of the Year&quot; and &quot;Biography of the Year&quot; at the Australian Book Industry Awards. Reviewer Peter Craven, in &quot;The Australian&quot;, said it would &quot;dazzle every kind of reader&quot; and described it as &quot;a riveting, overwhelmingly poignant autobiography by a woman of genius. It is a book about how someone might live with the idea of killing the thing they love. It is a story of love and death and redemption and a daughter&#x27;s love for her father. It is an extraordinary hymn to the tragic heroism at the heart of ordinary life and the soaring moral scrutiny of womankind. Every library should have it, every school should teach it.&quot; Richard Ferguson in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote, &quot;This is documentary writing of the highest order and Szubanski has given life to an incredible war story...Reckoning, this tale of war and suburbia, sexuality and comedy&quot; and referred to Szubanski as an A-grade non-fiction writer.

Actor and friend Geoffrey Rush launched her book and wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I was absorbed in preparing for King Lear when I read the book. The classical stature of that particular father-daughter relationship didn&#x27;t go unnoticed. Magda grew up in the shadow of a difficult reckoning — the summation, the questioning, the Elizabethan sense of settling the bill with one&#x27;s parents. As she phrases it: her father needed to forget— she needed to remember. The only way forward was back. Her book riffs a major life in a reflective minor key. I&#x27;ve got lost in Joyce&#x27;s Dublin, Woolf&#x27;s Bloomsbury, the Bronte Sisters&#x27; Yorkshire moors. Now I&#x27;m enthralled with Magda Szubanski&#x27;s Croydon, Australia&#x27;s own collective sub-conscious suburb, the architecture of which she deftly anoints as Bauhaus&#x27;s &quot;bastard child&quot;...Reckoning is really a non-fiction novel – and its invitation into Magda&#x27;s story is infectious.&quot; The New South Wales Premier&#x27;s Award judges described &quot;Reckoning&quot; as &#x27;warm, clear, wise, funny and deeply intelligent. The amplitude of Szubanski&#x27;s writing is particularly impressive. Her voice has a light surety, while constantly giving narrative and moral weight to the larger themes of grief, family, migration and finding one&#x27;s place in the world&#x27;.&quot;

===Children&#x27;s literature===
Szubanski is the author of &quot;Timmy the Ticked Off Pony&quot;, a series of children&#x27;s books illustrated by Dean Rankine.

=== Recognition ===
In 2019, Szubanski was appointed an officer in the general division of the Order of Australia (AO) &quot;for distinguished service to the performing arts as an actor, comedian and writer, and as a campaigner for marriage equality.&quot;

==LGBT rights activism==
Szubanski has been a vocal campaigner for LGBT rights and for same-sex marriage since coming out publicly in 2012. She is patron of the LGBT group, Twenty/10.

During the same-sex Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, Szubanski was interviewed on several TV shows advocating for a &quot;Yes&quot; result. The co-chair of Australian Marriage Equality rated her crucial in the success of the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign.

==Charity==
In 2020, Szubanski and Will &quot;Egg Boy&quot; Connolly raised $190,000 for bushfire affected communities and together with trauma experts co-founded &quot;Regeneration&quot;, a creative arts project to provide mental-health support.

In 2013, Szubanski became the Patron of &quot;Twenty10&quot;.

==Controversies==
In the 90s Szubanski did blackface for a television show which aired on the Seven Network.

In 2019, Szubanski was involved in a campaign targeting Christian preacher and rugby league football player Israel Folau after he called on homosexuals to &quot;repent of their sins and turn to God&quot;. Szubanski prominently launched an appeal to fund opposition to Folau. After Szubanski was criticized, Folau called for an end to on-line attacks on Szubanski.

In 2020, the Commissioner for eSafety, Julie Inman Grant, told senate estimates that Szubanski had been the target of &quot;Volumetric...co-ordinated right-wing extremist attacks&quot; after she appeared in a COVID safety ad.

In April 2021 Szubanski faced criticism and calls for her to hand back the award which had appointed her officer in the Order of Australia (AO) after she criticised the appearance of Jenny Morrison, wife of the Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. Commenting on the Morrisons in a photograph of the Prime Minister signing a condolence book after the death of Prince Philip, Szubanski compared the Prime Minister&#x27;s wife&#x27;s appearance to a character in a fictional religious extremist society of sex slaves from the series &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 14 February 2012, Szubanski came out in a statement supporting same-sex marriage and stated that she &quot;absolutely identifies as gay&quot; in an interview on Australian TV current affairs program &quot;The Project&quot;. Szubanski has described herself as &quot;culturally Catholic&quot;.

<text>Frank Alvin Gotch (April 27, 1878 – December 17, 1917) was an American professional wrestler. Gotch was the first American professional wrestler to win the World Heavyweight Championship in catch wrestling, and he is credited for popularizing professional wrestling in the United States. He competed back when the contests at championship level were largely legit (see catch wrestling), and his reign as World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion (from 1908 to 1913) is one of the ten longest in the history of professional wrestling. He became one of the most popular athletes in America from the 1900s to the 1910s. &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; described Gotch as &quot;arguably the best North American professional wrestler of the 20th century&quot;.

== Early life ==
The son of Frederick Rudolph and Amelia Gotch, of German ancestry, he was born and raised on a small farm three miles south of Humboldt, Iowa. He took up wrestling in his teens, earning a reputation by beating locals. He adopted the toe hold as his signature finishing move.

== Professional wrestling career ==

Gotch wrestled and won his first match against Marshall Green in Humboldt on April 2, 1899, but his first important match was in Lu Verne, Iowa on June 16, 1899, against a man claiming to be a furniture dealer from a neighboring town. Gotch held his own for nearly two hours, but lost the hard-fought contest. Only later when he received the impressed man&#x27;s visiting card, did he learn that his opponent had actually been reigning American Heavyweight Champion Dan McLeod. On December 18, 1899, Gotch challenged another former American Heavyweight Champion, &quot;Farmer&quot; Martin Burns, losing in 11 minutes, but impressing Burns as well, who offered to train Gotch. Under the guidance of Burns, Gotch won a series of matches in Iowa and later Yukon. While in the Yukon, Gotch wrestled under the name Frank Kennedy and won the title of &quot;Champion of the Klondike&quot;. During his time in the Yukon, Gotch tried his hand at boxing, but failed miserably against the heavyweight Frank &quot;Paddy&quot; Slavin.

Gotch returned to Iowa and instantly challenged the reigning American Heavyweight Champion Tom Jenkins. Gotch lost his first match in 1903, before defeating Jenkins in a rematch on January 27, 1904, to take the championship. After trading the title with Jenkins and Fred Beell, Gotch set his sights on the World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship, then held by the undefeated Estonian George Hackenschmidt. The opponent, called the &quot;Russian Lion&quot;, had gained undisputed title recognition by defeating Jenkins in New York in 1905. Upon defeating Jenkins, however, Hackenschmidt ignored Gotch&#x27;s challenge and sailed home to England.

In 1905 Gotch beat Jack Carkeek in a Cornish wrestling match, while Jack claimed to be world Cornish wrestling champion.
Gotch and Hackenschmidt finally met on April 3, 1908, at the Dexter Park Pavilion in Chicago. Showing his contempt for Gotch and for American wrestling in general, Hackenschmidt was not in the best condition, unlike Gotch, who used his speed, defense and rough tactics to wear Hackenschmidt down and then assume the attack. The wrestlers stood on their feet for two full hours before Gotch was able to get behind Hackenschmidt and take him down. While on their feet, Gotch made sure to lean on Hackenschmidt to wear him down. He bullied him around the ring, and his thumbing and butting left Hackenschmidt covered in blood. Hackenschmidt complained to the referee of Gotch&#x27;s foul tactics and asked that Gotch be forced to take a hot shower to rid his body of an abundance of oil, but the referee ignored the complaints and told Hackenschmidt he should have noticed the oil before the match began. The match continued until the two-hour mark, when Hackenschmidt was forced against the ropes. Gotch tore him off the ropes, threw Hackenschmidt down and rode him hard for three minutes, working for his dreaded toe hold. Hackenschmidt had trained to avoid this hold, which he did, but the effort took his last remaining strength. Hackenschmidt quit the fall. &quot;I surrender the championship of the world to Mr. Gotch&quot;, he said, and stood up and shook Gotch&#x27;s hand. The wrestlers then retired to their dressing rooms before coming out for the second fall, but Hackenschmidt refused to return to the ring, telling the referee to declare Gotch the winner, thereby relinquishing his title to him.

&quot;He is the king of the class, the greatest man by far I ever met&quot;, Hackenschmidt said. &quot;After going nearly two hours with him, my muscles became stale. My feet also gave out. I had trained constantly against the toe hold and had strained the muscles of my legs. When I found myself weakening, I knew there was no use continuing and that I had no chance to win. That was the reason I conceded the championship to him. I have no desire to wrestle him again. A return match would not win back my title&quot;. Hackenschmidt later reversed his opinion of Gotch and Americans in general, claiming to have been fouled by Gotch and victimized in America, and calling for a rematch in Europe.

As undisputed free-style heavyweight champion of the world, Gotch spent the next three years establishing his dominance over the sport, defeating the likes of Jenkins, Dr. Ben Roller, and Stanislaus Zbyszko, who was believed to have won over 900 matches before falling to Gotch on June 1, 1910. The victory over Zbyszko was particularly spectacular, as Gotch took both falls in slightly less than half an hour, and thoroughly dominated Zbyszko. He took the first fall in just six seconds with a surprise move and quick pin, and won the second fall in only 27 minutes. Gotch outmaneuvered and outclassed Zbyszko every second of the match.

Gotch became a national sensation, and he was in demand everywhere for public appearances. He starred in a play called &quot;All About A Bout&quot;, and whenever he walked on stage he was greeted by a standing ovation. He was invited to the White House by United States President Theodore Roosevelt, and wrestled a Japanese ju-jitsu expert in the East Hall, making his opponent submit. The night before his second match with Hackenschmidt, he attended a Chicago Cubs baseball game at Wrigley Field with his wife and in-laws and took his seat down front. After the game, nearly every member of the Cubs team came to his private box and asked for his autograph. When he traveled overseas with his play, Gotch was a huge hit, as it seemed that everywhere he went, fans wanted to see him. Everywhere he went, he made wrestling &quot;big time&quot;.

Gotch met Hackenschmidt again on September 4, 1911, at the newly opened Comiskey Park in Chicago, which drew a crowd of nearly 30,000 spectators and a record gate of $87,000. The rematch is one of the most controversial and talked about matches in professional wrestling history, as Hackenschmidt injured his knee against Roller, his chief training partner. Years later, wrestler Ad Santel told Lou Thesz that he was paid $5,000 by Gotch&#x27;s backers to cripple Hackenschmidt in training, and make it look like an accident. However, according to Hackenschmidt himself, the injury was accidentally inflicted by his sparring partner, Dr. Roller, when trying to hold Hackenschmidt down onto his knees and Roller&#x27;s right foot striking Hackenschmidt&#x27;s right knee. According to Hackenschmidt, his sparring partners were Americus (Gus Schoenlein), Jacobus Koch, Wladek Zbyszko and Dr. Roller. Ad Santel is not mentioned in any account of Hackenschmidt&#x27;s training by either Hackenschmidt or Roller, both of whom offered their insights and accounts. Whatever the case may be, if the injury was real, Dr. Roller did not consider it serious and referee Ed Smith dismissed it as inconsequential. Hackenschmidt himself ignored it completely in declaring, the day before the match, that he was &quot;fit to wrestle for my life&quot; and was &quot;satisfied with my condition and confident of the outcome&quot;. If there was a knee injury, Gotch discovered it quickly and took advantage of it, so Hackenschmidt was easy prey for Gotch, losing in straight falls in only 30 minutes. Gotch clinched the match with his feared toe hold, which forced Hackenschmidt to quit.

Gotch reigned as the World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion from his first victory over Hackenschmidt in 1908 until he retired in 1913 after defeating Estonian Georg Lurich April 1, 1913, in Kansas City, Missouri. Gotch is one of the longer reigning world champions in the history of professional wrestling, with a reign that spanned nearly five years; the only other champions to have longer reigns than Gotch are Bruno Sammartino, who held the WWF World Heavyweight Championship for a record of seven years and eight months, Lou Thesz, whose fifth NWA World Heavyweight Championship lasted seven years and seven months, and Verne Gagne who held the AWA World Heavyweight Title for seven years and three months.

== Wrestling style ==
Gotch competed in an era when a championship wrestling match was the same as a championship prize fight: i.e., it was a major event for which the wrestlers went into training and which promoters publicized for weeks. Thus, he did not have a long career in terms of the number of matches wrestled. His mentor Farmer Burns, and later champions Ed Lewis, the &quot;Strangler&quot;, as well as Lou Thesz, each engaged in more than 6,000 matches in their careers. Gotch engaged in only 160, finishing with a record of 154 wins and only 6 losses. Of those six losses, however, two were in the first year of his career – to Dan McLeod and Farmer Burns – and three were to Tom Jenkins. His last defeat was to Fred Beell on December 1, 1906, when he had crashed head-first into an uncovered turnbuckle and been rendered nearly unconscious. He defeated Beell in seven rematches and never lost again by the time of his retirement in 1913.

Gotch was, by all accounts, a superior professional wrestler possessing tremendous strength, lightning quickness, genuine agility, cat-like reflexes, impeccable technique, superb ring generalship, a mastery of the use of leverage, and a full knowledge of professional wrestling holds, counterholds and strategy. He was always in the best of condition and possessed both enormous courage and an indomitable will to win, ever ready to match his heart, his gameness, against any man in the world. He was highly aggressive, but always kept his cool. Critics saw in him both the strength of the old school of professional wrestling and the skill of the new, &quot;as agile as a cat in his manoeuvers&quot; and having &quot;the grappling sport down to such science that he had assumed a rank all by himself&quot;. Gotch&#x27;s measurements for his 1911 victory over Hackenschmidt were: age – 33; weight – 204 pounds; height – 5&#x27;11&quot;; reach – 73&quot;; biceps – 17.5&quot;; forearm – 14&quot;; neck – 18&quot;; chest – 45&quot;; waist – 34&quot;; thigh – 22&quot;; calf – 18&quot;.

There is another side to this story that, when Lou Thesz was just starting out in the early 1930s, there were a good many professional wrestlers still active who had known Gotch and were not reluctant to talk about him. &quot;The picture that emerged of Gotch from those conversations&quot;, Thesz recalled, &quot;was of a man who succeeded at his business primarily because he was, for lack of a kinder description, a dirty wrestler. That&#x27;s not to say that he wasn&#x27;t competent, because everyone I ever talked with said he was one of the best. But those same people described him as someone who delighted in hurting or torturing lesser opponents, even when they were supposed to be working out, and he was always looking for an illegal edge when he was matched against worthy ones. One of the old-timers I met was a fine man named Charlie Cutler, who knew Gotch very well and succeeded him as world champion; according to Cutler, Gotch would check the oil, pull hair and even break a bone to get an advantage in a contest, and he was unusually careful to have the referee in his pocket, too, in case all else failed&quot;. Referee Ed Smith, who officiated several of Gotch&#x27;s bouts, including both of the Gotch-Hackenschmidt contests, had observed after the second match that &quot;to my mind... he wasn&#x27;t just exactly through one hundred percent on the courageous side. Two or three times I saw needless acts of absolute cruelty on his part that I did not like. Always will I think that the really courageous man, no matter how ferocious and filled with the killing instinct and eager to win he may be, is willing to let up on a beaten foe and not punish needlessly or wantonly&quot;.

== Marriage ==
For years one of America&#x27;s most eligible bachelors, Gotch married Gladys Oestrich (born 1891) on February 11, 1911. She died on October 15, 1930. They had one son, Frank Robert Gotch (February 24, 1914 - December 7, 1971).

== Retirement and death ==
While in retirement, Gotch joined Sells-Floto Circus where he would pay any man $250.00 if they could last 15 minutes in a match against him without being pinned or conceding. Not once did he have to pay. He grew tired of touring and moved back to Humboldt. After a year of health troubles, Gotch died at home in 1917 of what was rumored to be syphilis, but the official cause of death was uremic poisoning. He left behind his wife Gladys and their son, Frank Robert. All are entombed together in the Gotch mausoleum in the Union Cemetery in Humboldt.

== Legacy ==
&quot;The story of American Wrestling at its greatest&quot;, Nat Fleischer wrote in 1936, &quot;is the story of the career of its most illustrious champion—Frank Gotch... Gotch was to wrestling history in this country what John L. Sullivan was to boxing. He dominated the field. Through his extraordinary ability, he gained for wrestling many converts and brought the sport into such favor that it became as big in the promotorial field as boxing&quot;.

As Mark Palmer pointed out, &quot;For starters, George Hackenschmidt and Frank Gotch were major sports superstars of the early 20th century. Fans of all ages collected cabinet cards and postcards with their images, read their books, and devoured articles about them in newspapers. Their epic matches were front-page news around the world—akin to today&#x27;s Super Bowl or soccer&#x27;s World Cup in terms of garnering global attention—and helped to launch organized amateur wrestling in the United States in the early part of the 20th century. In fact, a large number of high school and college wrestling programs can trace their roots back to the 1910s and 1920s—the era when Hackenschmidt and Gotch were still household names, and highly respected athletes&quot;.

Gotch was also a major sports superstar, often called the Hulk Hogan of his day, who lifted professional wrestling to new heights of popularity. When he became world champion, there were not many sports competing with wrestling for public attention. Horse racing remained a favorite sport and major league baseball was growing in popularity, but was not yet the national pastime. Automobile racing was in its infancy; golf was still the province of the wealthy; basketball had just been invented and was vying for attention; boxing offered a man a chance at fame and fortune, but was at this time riddled with scandals; the National Hockey League was formed the same year; and college football—the Ivy League game—was on the verge of being outlawed because it was too rough and too dangerous. Wrestling at the higher professional levels was still a legit sport with the added bonus that it was popular on every continent of the globe. A number of great professional wrestlers were competing for top honors. In India, The Great Gama was already a legendary champion, and in Europe, George Hackenschmidt had reigned supreme with Stanislaus Zbyszko coming along. However, in the United States, Tom Jenkins had been rather easily beaten by Hackenschmidt, so there was no American to capture the nation&#x27;s fancy until Gotch; and none of the other great professional wrestlers had either the physical attributes or the gift for self-promotion that Gotch possessed. Furthermore, the United States was beginning to dominate some of the world&#x27;s major sports. Americans already dominated boxing and within a decade would begin to dominate golf. When Gotch defeated Hackenschmidt, the domination of professional wrestling passed to the Americans. In addition, many matches had still been conducted under Greco-Roman wrestling rules, but this match caused Greco-Roman to be forever replaced by the more exciting catch-as-catch-can style.

Because of both his superior ability and his gift for self-promotion, Gotch became one of America&#x27;s greatest sports idols. He achieved a level of popularity similar to that formerly held by boxer John L. Sullivan and harness racehorse Dan Patch, and enjoyed later by such sports heroes of the Golden Age of Sports as boxing&#x27;s Jack Dempsey, baseball&#x27;s Babe Ruth, tennis&#x27;s Bill Tilden and golf&#x27;s Bobby Jones. This in turn made professional wrestling mainstream. Mac Davis wrote in &quot;100 Greatest Sports Heroes&quot;, &quot;As the idol of millions in the United States, Canada and Mexico, Gotch made [professional] wrestling a big-time sport in his day. He drew larger audiences than did the heavyweight champion of boxing when defending his title&quot;.

Gotch&#x27;s first match against Hackenschmidt also remains perhaps the most famous professional wrestling encounter of all time.

=== Honors and tributes ===
Gotch was among the first elected to the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame (1951), and was the first inductee to both the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum (2002) in Amsterdam, New York and the George Tragos &amp; Lou Thesz Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame (1999) in Waterloo, Iowa.

There is a 67-acre camping park named the Frank A. Gotch State Park, four miles south of Humboldt near his childhood farm, in homage to Gotch.

The Humboldt Community School District sponsors the annual Frank Gotch Wrestling Tournament. Because of Gotch&#x27;s legacy, Iowa remains a wrestling stronghold at the high school and collegiate levels to this day. Gotch&#x27;s success and fame is credited with playing a part in the creation of the Iowa High School Wrestling Tournament in 1921.

The 1957 musical The Music Man mentions the exciting contest between Gotch and Strangler Ed Lewis, whose nickname is mispronounced as &quot;Strangular&quot; by River City Mayor Shinn in one of many malapropisms throughout the show.

On July 4, 2012, an eight-foot tall bronze statue of Gotch was unveiled in Bicknell Park in Humboldt, the site of his outdoor training camp where as many as 1,000 people watched him train before his second Hackenschmidt match. In December 2011, a street running along the park was renamed Frank Gotch Boulevard.

There is an extensive Gotch collection in the Dan Gable Wrestling Museum in Waterloo, Iowa. On display are the wrestling shoes he wore into the ring in 1911 against Hackenschmidt, his Mason&#x27;s sword and leather scabbard, the roll-top desk that sat in his living room in Humboldt, and many other rare items.

In addition, an independent film company acquired the rights to the book &quot;Gotch: An American Hero&quot; in 2008, a biography written by Mike Chapman published in 1999, and is listed as &quot;in pre-production&quot; on its official website, yet still does not appear on the film company&#x27;s IMDb credits page as in production as of April 2015.

In February 2015, WHO-TV news of Des Moines aired &quot;Iowa Icon: Gotch Up There with Feller, Warner, Gable&quot; with quotes from University of Iowa wrestling coach Tom Brands, among others, with the five-minute feature&#x27;s title recognizing Gotch as one of Iowa&#x27;s sports icons alongside Bob Feller, Kurt Warner, and college wrestling legend Dan Gable. The video and story is archived on its website.

Karl Gotch and Simon Gotch both took their professional wrestling names as a tribute to him.

On April 2, 2016, Gotch was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a &quot;Legacy&quot; member.

==== Frank Gotch World Catch Championships ====
With the revival of catch wrestling, tournaments have been held in Gotch&#x27;s name at his home town. The inaugural Frank Gotch World Catch Championships took place in Humboldt on July 3, 2016 with over 250 spectators. Roy Wood, head coach at The Snake Pit in England, was an honored guest at the event and led a catch wrestling seminar on July 2. At the tournament, the champions were Chris Morales (220+ lbs), Travis Wiuff (200-219 lbs), Anthony Pachek (160-179 lbs), Matt Tran (140-159 lbs), and Shayna Baszler (women&#x27;s openweight division), and there was a catchweight match with Curran Jacobs pinning Travis Warner.

The Frank Gotch World Catch Championships took place in Humboldt again on July 15, 2017. This edition used a single division, openweight format. Curran Jacobs won the tournament despite a 60 lb. weight disadvantage to Travis Wiuff in the final, who he beat with a Gotch toe hold, and Anthony Pachek placed third.

<text>The culture of Gibraltar reflects Gibraltarians&#x27; diverse origins. While there are Spanish and British influences, a result of the territory&#x27;s status as a British overseas territory and its proximity to Spain, the ethnic origins of most Gibraltarians are a mix of Andalusian Spaniards, Genoese, Maltese, Portuguese and British. The main religion is Christianity, the majority group being the Roman Catholic Church, then the Church of England. There is a long established Sephardic Jewish community, a number of Hindu Indians and a Moroccan Muslim population. Gibraltarians of Genoese origin came to The Rock in the 18th century, with the Maltese and Portuguese following in the 19th century, coming to work and trade in the British military base. Spanish Andalusian origins are the result of generations of intermarriage with inhabitants of surrounding towns.

During the Second World War, the whole civilian population of The Rock was evacuated by the British government, which decreed that &quot;the fortress comes first&quot;. They were moved to the United Kingdom, particularly to Fulham and Kensington in London and Ballymena in Northern Ireland, as well as Jamaica and Madeira. This served to strengthen a Gibraltarian, as opposed to simply British, identity, and after the war, there was a successful campaign for repatriation.

==Cultural relationships with United Kingdom and Spain==

===British Gibraltarians===

Gibraltarians have historically been proud of their British heritage, and unlike the inhabitants of other territories, sought to strengthen, rather than loosen their ties with the UK and the British Crown, seeing themselves as &quot;more British than the British&quot;. This sense of being British was particularly strong when the frontier with Spain was closed in 1969, and all communications links were severed. Until 16 December 2006, the only flights from Gibraltar Airport, were those to the UK. The fact that they are largely of Mediterranean appearance and speak an Andalusian Spanish variant, known as &quot;Llanito&quot; gives Gibraltarians a strong resemblance to Andalusian Spaniards, despite the Gibraltarian&#x27;s distinct cultural heritage and identity.

===Religion===
Most Gibraltarians are Roman Catholic, with the Diocese of Gibraltar being directly responsible to the Vatican. The Rock also forms part of the Church of England diocese covering mainland Europe, with a &quot;Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe&quot;. There is also a Methodist Church. The former St Andrew&#x27;s Church (part of the Church of Scotland) closed in 2022.

There is a small (800 members) but very influential Jewish minority, active in business and politics, and five synagogues. Most Moroccans are Muslim, and there is a large mosque at Europa Point, the Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque, paid for by Saudi Arabia. Most Indians are Hindu, with their own local temple.

Additionally there are two very active congregations of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses sharing the same Kingdom Hall; one has meetings in English and the other in Spanish.

===Relations with Spain===
Historically, cultural ties with Spain have been strong; a variant of Andalusian Spanish, &quot;Llanito&quot;, being the vernacular language of the territory. Intermarriage between Gibraltarians and Spaniards resulted in many people having relatives on the other side of the frontier, known in Spanish as &quot;La Verja&quot; or &#x27;the fence&#x27;. These people were badly affected by the closure of the frontier in 1969, which even saw telephone links severed, so that the only way that families could communicate was to shout across the border gates. Others took the more cumbersome and costly route of travelling first from Gibraltar to Tangiers by ferry and then taking another ferry to Algeciras, before taking a final coach to La Línea de la Concepción. A journey that would take half a day, when the end destination would have been within walking distance under normal circumstances.

Since the frontier with Spain was reopened, ties with the hinterland, known as the &quot;Campo de Gibraltar&quot;, have increased, with many buying property in places like La Línea de la Concepción, where prices are considerably lower, Sotogrande and even further afield like the Costa del Sol. On the weekends, many flock across the frontier, with livelier nightclubs and bars than in Gibraltar. Younger Gibraltarians have considerable exposure to popular culture from Spain, and even &quot;vice versa&quot;, the pop group &quot;Taxi&quot; having found success on the Spanish charts, virtually all of its songs being in Spanish. In addition, Gibraltarians of all ages are often avid supporters of Spanish football teams like FC Barcelona and Real Madrid C.F. as well as English teams such as Manchester United F.C. and Arsenal F.C.

However, the Gibraltar Football Association&#x27;s application for membership of UEFA, which would enable it to participate in the European Football Championships and the Football World Cup, has met with strong opposition from the Royal Spanish Football Federation. This is seen as yet another attempt to deny the existence of Gibraltar internationally.

While Gibraltarians have multiple identities, seeing themselves to varying degrees as Gibraltarian, British and European, they do not generally identify with the Spanish state. While some in Britain&#x27;s Foreign Office would like to see this closening of ties result in an &#x27;osmosis&#x27; between The Rock and the &quot;Campo de Gibraltar&quot;, there is no prospect of Gibraltarians accepting absorption into Spain. A trip across the frontier, even to La Línea, is still described as &quot;going to Spain&quot;.

===Relations with Britain===

British influence remains strong. Spanish may be widely spoken, but it is mainly used as a vernacular language, English being the only official language used in government, commerce, education and the media. Gibraltarians going on to higher education attend university in the UK and not in Spain. Many university graduates remain in the UK to pursue careers there. After the Second World War, most evacuees were repatriated, but some stayed on, while many also moved to the UK, thereby increasing family ties with the &quot;mother country&quot;. While television from Spain is easily received and widely watched, the availability of British television via satellite, particularly Sky and the BBC, means that Gibraltarians are as familiar with British news and popular culture as people in the UK itself.

==Surnames==
Many Gibraltarians have names that reflect their mixed British and Mediterranean heritage usually with British first names like Keith, Kyle, Nigel, James, John, Marie, Natalie, Samantha, etc. with surnames originating from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. Surnames in Gibraltar include those originating from:

; Genoa
E.g. Alecio, Bossano, Bottaro, Canessa, Cavilla, Culatto, Danino, Devincenzi, Felice, Ferrary, Ferro, Galliano, Imossi, Isola, Lavarello, Licudi, Massetti, Montegriffo, Olivero, Parody, Passano, Pitaluga, Pitto, Pizzarello, Povedano, Ramo, Risso, Sciacaluga, Stagnetto

==&#x27;Gibraltarian&#x27; vs &#x27;People of Gibraltar&#x27;==

===Gibraltarian British===
While many outsiders use the terms &#x27;Gibraltarians&#x27;, &#x27;people of Gibraltar&#x27; and &#x27;residents of Gibraltar&#x27; interchangeably, strictly speaking, &#x27;Gibraltarian&#x27; should be used only to describe those British citizens registered as having Gibraltarian status.

The UK originally regarded Gibraltarians as &quot;British Overseas Territories citizens&quot; (BOTC). In 1981 Gibraltarians successfully campaigned against this classification under the British Nationality Act, which would have deprived them of the right of abode in the UK, along with other colonial subjects. This was partly due to Gibraltar&#x27;s status as part of the then European Community (now European Union). As a result, the Gibraltarians acquired the right to register as full British citizens.

British passports issued in Gibraltar differ from those issued in the UK, in that they feature on the cover the word &quot;Gibraltar&quot; underneath &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;. Whereas UK-issued passports state that &quot;Her Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Secretary of State requests and requires in the name of Her Majesty the Queen to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance&quot;, Gibraltar-issued passports state that it is &quot;the Governor of Gibraltar&quot; who requests and requires this.

In 2004 an electoral register taken for the purposes of elections for the European Parliament showed that there were only 95 persons with the status of BOTC. Spain opposed the enfranchisement of the Gibraltarians in EU elections on the basis of the misconception that Gibraltarians were not full British citizens, but Commonwealth citizens, despite Commonwealth citizens living in the UK having always been able to vote in European elections.

===Other British===
There is a sizeable British expatriate minority, classified as &#x27;Other British&#x27; and sometimes referred to by the native Gibraltarians rather pejoratively as &quot;guiris&quot;. Historically, many came with the British military or as civil servants, with many marrying locals, and registering as Gibraltarians themselves, although any British citizen resident on The Rock for at least six months may vote. With the decline of the military presence, and the introduction of self-government, most from the UK instead come to work in the offshore finance sector. Many affluent people from the UK and elsewhere are classed as &quot;High Net Worth Individuals&quot;, who receive tax concessions in return for buying property and residing locally for at least part of the year. More recently, many futures traders have come to the Rock, since the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) switched to electronic trading in 1999, thereby reducing the need to be in London. Some in Gibraltar have criticised the current government&#x27;s policy, on the grounds that too much is being done to develop luxury properties for &#x27;High Net Worth Individuals&#x27;, and not enough to develop property for local people, a common complaint in many other small offshore jurisdictions. However, this should not be construed as hostility to British people or expatriates.

===Moroccans===
Following the closure of the frontier, Gibraltar could no longer rely on Spanish workers commuting from the Campo, resulting in a labour shortage. Gibraltar instead looked to Morocco, with many workers coming over by ferry and staying in government hostels. Although they paid income tax and social insurance, they were denied the right to either permanent residence or citizenship, only having renewable work permits. This policy has prompted criticism from human rights groups in the UK, who describe living and working conditions for Moroccans in Gibraltar as degrading.

===Indians===
Most Indians in Gibraltar are in business, many of the shops on the Rock&#x27;s Main Street being Indian-owned. Initially not able to obtain citizenship, an increasing number have done so.

==Sport==

The Ministry for Sport, headed by the Hon Edwin Reyes, Minister for Sport and Culture, is responsible for sports policy matters and the provision of support to educational establishments and the governing bodies of sport in Gibraltar.
Under the chairmanship of the Minister, a Gibraltar Sports Advisory Council has been set up to advise the Government of Gibraltar on all matters relating to sport.

The Government recognizes the benefits derived from participation in sports and recreational activities. Importance is given to the availability of suitable facilities for the practice of sport. There are a large number of Sports facilities in Gibraltar, of varying standards. These provide opportunities for residents and visitors alike to enjoy sport as a recreation and for the serious sports enthusiasts to improve standards and participate in local and International events.

There are, at the moment, eighteen Gibraltar Sports Associations that have gained official recognition from their respective International Governing Bodies. Others, including the Gibraltar National Olympic Committee, have submitted applications for recognition which are being considered.

In late 1999 a Sports Development Unit was set up to assist Gibraltar governing bodies of sport and Educational establishments to improve standards.

Gibraltar&#x27;s resident population is active in sport and standards are, by and large, rather high, in relation to Gibraltar&#x27;s population. Participation in officially recognised or other sports events, abroad or in Gibraltar, is welcomed by Gibraltar sports persons.

Gibraltar&#x27;s sports facilities are also being used by foreign sports persons for &#x27;warm-weather&#x27; training. This practice is being encouraged and more and better facilities are projected in order to improve the product for locals and visitors alike.

===The Gibraltar Football Association===
The GFA was formed as the Gibraltar Civilian Football Association in 1895, changing to its current name in later years. It is one of the oldest football associations in the world.

The GFA was formed as an increasing number of football clubs were coming into existence in Gibraltar, and the association was designed to bring some form of organisation to the game there. Between the association&#x27;s formation and 1907 the only football competition in Gibraltar was the Merchant&#x27;s Cup. However, in 1907 the GFA established a league to complement the existing cup competition.

By 1901, the GFA had established a representative &quot;national&quot; team, competing against military teams. This representative team continued to play down the years, their highlight probably being a draw against Real Madrid in 1949.

The GFA affiliated with The Football Association in 1909, but is currently trying to become a full member of UEFA so that its national team can compete in the European Football Championship and the Football World Cup.

===Gibraltar Football League===
The Gibraltar Football League was established by the Gibraltar Football Association (GFA) in 1905. It originally contained eight member clubs, but it has grown over the years.

In 1909 the league grew to two divisions, and it currently has three divisions which clubs can be promoted and relegated between at the end of each season.

===The Gibraltar cricket team===
Cricket has been played in Gibraltar by British servicemen since the late 18th century. A cricket ground is known to have existed north of the Rock of Gibraltar in 1800. Civilians were playing the game as well as servicemen by 1822.

The Gibraltar Cricket Club was formed in 1883, and formed the backbone of civilian cricket until well into the 20th Century.

In 1890, a ship carrying the Australian cricket team on the way to a tour of England, docked in Gibraltar Harbour after a collision with two other ships. The Australians played a game against a Gibraltar Garrison team. The local side were dismissed for just 25, and the Australians won the game, scoring 150/8.

Gibraltar first participated in the ICC Trophy in 1982, and have played every tournament since, with the exception of the 2005 tournament, for which they failed to qualify. They have also competed in the European Championship on every occasion since it began in 1996.

===Rugby Union===
Campo Gibraltar Rugby Union Football Club plays all its games in nearby Spain.

==Music==
Gibraltar has a small but thriving music scene spanning several genres, from electronic music to singer-songwriters and reggaes. Its best-known bands internationally were Melon Diesel (1995–2003), who gained considerable fame in both Spain and Latin America, and Breed 77 (1996–2018), who gained traction in the UK and Europe.

==Cuisine==

Gibraltarian cuisine has evolved over the past two centuries as a unique blend of various dishes, of which calentita is the most iconic.

<text>Thomas Edmund Gleisner (born 24 October 1962) is an Australian comedian, television presenter, producer, director, writer, occasional actor and author. Gleisner currently hosts Network 10&#x27;s &quot;Have You Been Paying Attention?&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Gleisner was educated at Xavier College in Melbourne, Australia. He attended the University of Melbourne in the 1980s, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws in 1987. While he was a university student he began working with Santo Cilauro and Rob Sitch in the 1983 Law Revue &quot;Legal A.I.D.S.&quot; Gleisner wrote and performed in the 1985 Melbourne University Revue &quot;Too Cool for Sandals.&quot;

== Television, radio, and film ==
Gleisner was credited as a writer on &quot;The D-Generation&quot; (1986–1987) but not as a regular performer. He did, however, appear on numerous occasions as a guest star (he featured more prominently in the second season), and on the album &quot;The Satanic Sketches&quot;.

Gleisner went on to perform in the D-Gen&#x27;s late-eighties Triple M radio show (and its spin-off album &quot;The Breakfast Tapes&quot;), and then starred in, and wrote for, ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot; (1992–1993). His best-remembered performances in &quot;The Late Show&quot; included the newsreader of &quot;Late Show News,&quot; the co-host of &quot;Countdown Classics&quot; with Jane Kennedy and the interviewer of stuntman Rob Sitch in &quot;Shitscared,&quot; although he appeared in various other sketches (including a recurring role as brainless bush-traveller &quot;Wallaby Jack&quot;).

After &quot;The Late Show&quot; finished, Gleisner co-founded Working Dog Productions, along with Santo Cilauro, Jane Kennedy and Rob Sitch. Their first venture was &quot;Frontline&quot; which ran on the ABC from 1994 until 1997. Gleisner was a writer/producer/director, and also had a minor role as photocopier repairman Colin Konica.

In 1995, Gleisner starred as mute cop Poncho on &quot;Funky Squad&quot; on ABC, another Working Dog comedy which he co-created and served on as a writer/producer/directors. Gleisner co-wrote the Working Dog films &quot;The Castle&quot; (1997), &quot;The Dish&quot; (2000) and &quot;Any Questions for Ben?&quot; (2012). He also hosted and co-executive produced the popular Network Ten program &quot;The Panel&quot; (1998–2004). Gleisner has also appeared with Rob Sitch as a presenter of the ABC TV fly-fishing documentary &quot;A River Somewhere&quot; (1997–1998). He wrote and directed the Glenn Robbins comedy, &quot;All Aussie Adventures&quot; (2001–2002, 2004, 2018), was the judge on the improvised comedy program &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot; from 2006 to 2009, but was replaced by various judges from 2023, and co-wrote/co-produced Working Dog&#x27;s &quot;The Hollowmen&quot; (2008), &quot;Utopia&quot; (2014–2023), and &quot;Pacific Heat&quot; (2016).

Currently he is host of the popular Australian quiz show &quot;Have You Been Paying Attention?&quot; (2013–present), and a producer of &quot;The Cheap Seats&quot; (2021–present).

==Books==

Gleisner has written four comedic books in the persona of a fictitious cricketer, Warwick Todd, &quot;The Warwick Todd Diaries&quot; (1997), &quot;Warwick Todd: Back in the Baggy Green&quot; (1998), &quot;Warwick Todd Goes The Tonk&quot; (2001) and &quot;Warwick Todd – Up in the Block Hole&quot; (2009). He has appeared in his Warwick Todd persona in guest appearances on TV.

It was one of twenty-six districts created on 1 October 1973 and covered the town of Ballymena and the surrounding area which includes small towns including Broughshane, Cullybackey, Galgorm, Ahoghill and Portglenone. The borough had an area of and a population of 64,044 according to the 2011 census. The borough had a central location within Northern Ireland and was served by the M2 motorway and with a station on the Belfast-Derry/Londonderry railway line. Belfast International Airport itself was only away and the Belfast City Airport is from Ballymena. It was also accessible to the seaports of Larne and Belfast, 20 and away respectively. As of 2015 it has been replaced by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.

==Parliamentary and assembly representation==

<doc id="379764" wikidata="Q76569" url="?curid=379764" title="Little curlew">
<text>The little curlew (Numenius minutus) is a wader in the large bird family Scolopacidae. It is a very small curlew, which breeds in the far north of Siberia. It is closely related to the North American Eskimo curlew.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;curlew&quot; is imitative of the Eurasian curlew&#x27;s call, but may have been influenced by the Old French &quot;corliu&quot;, &quot;messenger&quot;, from &quot;courir &quot;, &quot;to run&quot;. It was first recorded in 1377 in Langland&#x27;s Piers Plowman. The genus name &quot;Numenius&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;noumenios&quot;, a bird mentioned by Hesychius. It is associated with the curlews because it appears to be derived from &quot;neos&quot;, &quot;new&quot;, and &quot;mene&quot;, &quot;moon&quot;, referring to the crescent-shaped bill. The species name is from Latin &quot;minutus&quot;, &quot;small&quot;.

== Description ==
It is mainly greyish-brown, including the underwings, with a white belly, and a short, for a curlew, curved bill. It has a head pattern like a Eurasian whimbrel, with crown and superciliary stripes. The call is a repetitive whistle. It is the smallest species of curlew with an average length of , an average wingspan of and an average weight of .

== Behaviour ==
This is a strongly migratory species, wintering in Australasia. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, including once in Blankenberge, Belgium, in September 2010. In the winter of 2019/2020 a bird was seen in The Netherlands.

=== Breeding ===
This bird breeds in loose colonies in forest clearings in river valleys. The nest is a ground scrape. It winters inland on grassland, cultivation or near fresh water, mainly in northern Australia but also as far south as St Kilda, South Australia. It is gregarious, forming sizeable flocks. This species feeds by probing soft mud for small invertebrates.

<doc id="379771" wikidata="Q165257" url="?curid=379771" title="Lope de Vega">
<text>Félix Lope de Vega y Carpio (; 25 November 156227 August 1635) was a Spanish playwright, poet, and novelist who was a key figure in the Spanish Golden Age (1492–1659) of Baroque literature. In the literature of Spain, Lope de Vega is second to Miguel de Cervantes. Cervantes said that Lope de Vega was “The Phoenix of Wits” (&quot;Fénix de los ingenios&quot;) and “Monster of Nature” (&quot;Monstruo de naturaleza&quot;).

Lope de Vega renewed the literary life of Spanish theatre when it became mass culture, and with the playwrights Pedro Calderón de la Barca and Tirso de Molina defined the characteristics of Spanish Baroque theatre with great insight into the human condition. The literary production of Lope de Vega includes 3,000 sonnets, three novels, four novellas, nine epic poems, and approximately 500 stageplays.

Personally and professionally, Lope de Vega was friend to the writer Francisco de Quevedo and arch-enemy of the dramatist Juan Ruiz de Alarcón. The volume of literary works produced by Lope de Vega earned him the envy of his contemporaries, such as Cervantes and Luis de Góngora, and the admiration of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe for such a vast and colourful oeuvre. Lope de Vega was also a close friend of Sebastian Francisco de Medrano, founder and president of the Medrano Academy (Poetic Academy of Madrid). He would attend Medrano&#x27;s Academy from 1616 to 1626, and his relationship with Medrano is evident in his &quot;El Laurel de Apolo&quot; (1630) in silva VII.

==Life==

===Youth===
Lope de Vega Carpio was born November 1562 in Madrid, in the Puerta de Guadalajara to a family of natives of the valley of Carriedo. His father, Félix de Vega, was an embroiderer. Little is known of his mother, Francisca Fernández Flores. He later took the distinguished surname of Carpio from his paternal grandmother, Catalina del Carpio.

After a brief stay in Valladolid, his father moved to Madrid in 1561, perhaps drawn by the possibilities of the new capital city. However, Lope de Vega would later affirm that his father arrived in Madrid through a love affair from which his future mother was to rescue him. Thus the writer became the fruit of this reconciliation and owed his existence to the same jealousies he would later analyze so much in his dramatic works.

The first indications of young Lope&#x27;s genius became apparent in his earliest years. His friend and biographer Pérez de Montalbán stated that at the age of five he was already reading Spanish and Latin. While he was still unable to write, he would share his breakfast with the older boys in exchange for their help scribing his verses. By his tenth birthday, he was translating Latin verse. He wrote his first play when he was 12, allegedly &quot;El verdadero amante&quot;, as he would later affirm in his dedication of the work to his son Lope, although these statements are most probably exaggerations.

His great talent bore him to the school of poet and musician Vicente Espinel in Madrid, to whom he later always referred with veneration. In his fourteenth year he continued his studies in the &quot;Colegio Imperial&quot;, a Jesuit school in Madrid, from which he absconded to take part in a military expedition in Portugal. Following that escapade, he had the good fortune of being taken into the protection of the Bishop of Ávila, who recognized the lad&#x27;s talent and saw him enrolled in the University of Alcalá. Following graduation, Lope had planned to follow in his patron&#x27;s footsteps and join the priesthood, but those plans were dashed by falling in love and realizing that celibacy was not for him. Thus he failed to attain a bachelor&#x27;s degree and made what living he could as a secretary to aristocrats or by writing plays.

In 1583 Lope enlisted in the Spanish Navy and saw action at the Battle of Ponta Delgada in the Azores, under the command of his future friend Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz, to whose son he would later dedicate a play.

Following this, he returned to Madrid and began his career as a playwright in earnest. He also began a love affair with Elena Osorio (the &quot;Filis&quot; of his poems), who was separated from her husband, actor Cristóbal Calderón, and was the daughter of a leading theater director. When, after some five years of this torrid affair, Elena spurned Lope in favor of another suitor, his vitriolic attacks on her and her family landed him in jail for libel and, ultimately, earned him the punishment of eight years&#x27; banishment from the court and two years&#x27; exile from Castile.

===Exile===
After libelling members of his family in his writing, Lope de Vega undauntedly went into exile. He took with him 16-year-old Isabel de Alderete y Urbina, known in his poems by the anagram &quot;Belisa,&quot; the daughter of Philip II&#x27;s court painter, Diego de Urbina. The two married under pressure from her family on 10 May 1588.

Just a few weeks later, on 29 May, Lope signed up for another tour of duty with the Spanish Navy: this was the summer of 1588, and the Armada was about to sail against England. It is likely that his military enlistment was the condition required by Isabel&#x27;s family, eager to be rid of such an ill presentable son-in-law, to forgive him for carrying her away.

Lope&#x27;s luck again served him well, however, and his ship, the &quot;San Juan&quot;, was one of the vessels to make it home to Spanish harbors in the aftermath of that failed expedition. Back in Spain by December 1588, he settled in the city of Valencia. There he lived with Isabel de Urbina and continued perfecting his dramatic formula participating regularly in the &quot;tertulia&quot; known as the &quot;Academia de los nocturnos&quot;, in the company of such accomplished dramatists as the canon Francisco Agustín Tárrega, the secretary to the Duke of Gandía Gaspar de Aguilar, Guillén de Castro, Carlos Boyl, and Ricardo de Turia. With them he refined his approach to theatrical writing by violating the unity of action and weaving two plots together in a single play, a technique known as imbroglio.

In 1590, at the end of his two years&#x27; exile from the realm, he moved to Toledo to serve Francisco de Ribera Barroso, who later became the 2nd Marquis of Malpica, and, some time later, Antonio Álvarez de Toledo, 5th Duke of Alba. In this later appointment he became gentleman of the bedchamber to the ducal court of the House of Alba, where he lived from 1592 to 1595. Here he read the work of Juan del Encina, from whom he improved the character of the &quot;donaire&quot;, perfecting still further his dramatic formula. In the fall of 1594, Isabel de Urbina died of postpartum complications. It was around this time that Lope wrote his pastoral novel &quot;La Arcadia&quot;, which included many poems and was based on the Duke&#x27;s household in Alba de Tormes.

===Return to Castile===

In 1595, following Isabel&#x27;s death in childbirth, he left the Duke&#x27;s service and – eight years having passed – returned to Madrid. There were other love affairs and other scandals: Antonia Trillo de Armenta, who earned him another lawsuit, and Micaela de Luján, an illiterate but beautiful actress, who inspired a rich series of sonnets, rewarded him with four children and was his lover until around 1608. In 1598, he married Juana de Guardo, the daughter of a wealthy butcher. Nevertheless, his trysts with others – including Micaela – continued.

In the 17th century Lope&#x27;s literary output reached its peak. From 1607 he was also employed as a secretary, but not without various additional duties, by the Duke of Sessa. Once that decade was over, however, his personal situation took a turn for the worse. His favorite son, Carlos Félix (by Juana), died and, in 1612, Juana herself died in childbirth. After the heartbreaking loss of his son and wife, Lope summoned his remaining children still alive under the same roof to devote himself to Christianity. His writing in the early 1610s also assumed heavier religious influences and, in 1614, he joined the priesthood. The taking of holy orders did not, however, impede his romantic dalliances; what is more, he supplied his employer the duke with various female companions. The most notable and lasting of Lope&#x27;s relationships was with Marta de Nevares, who met him in 1616 and would remain with him until her death in 1632.

Further tragedies followed in 1635 with the loss of Lope, his son by Micaela and a worthy poet in his own right, in a shipwreck off the coast of Venezuela, and the abduction and subsequent abandonment of his beloved youngest daughter Antonia. Lope de Vega took to his bed and died of scarlet fever, in Madrid, on 27 August of that year. He was buried in St Sebastian&#x27;s Church, Madrid.

===Priesthood===

The period of life that characterizes priestly ordination of Lope de Vega was one of profound existential crisis, perhaps impelled by the death of close relatives. To this inspiration respond his Sacred Rhymes and the numerous devout works he began to compose, as well as the meditative and philosophical tone that appears in his last verses. On the night of 19 December 1611 the writer was the victim of an assassination attempt from which he could barely escape. Juana de Guardo suffered frequent illnesses and in 1612 Carlos Félix died of fevers. On 13 August the following year Juana de Guardo died while giving birth to Feliciana. So many misfortunes affected Lope emotionally, and on 24 May 1614 he finally decided to be ordained a priest.

The literary expression of this crisis and its repentances are the Sacred Rhymes, published in 1614; there it says: &quot;If the body wants to be earth on earth / the soul wants to be heaven in heaven&quot;, unredeemed dualism that constitutes all its essence. The Sacred Rhymes constitute a book at the same time introspective in the sonnets (he uses the technique of the spiritual exercises that he learned in his studies with the Jesuits) as devotee for the poems dedicated to diverse saints or inspired in the sacred iconography, then in full deployment thanks to the recommendations emanated from the Council of Trent.

In 1627 he was admitted as a knight of the Order of Malta. This was an enormous honour for him since he had always taken an interest in orders of chivalry. In 1603 he had published the play &quot;El valor de Malta&quot; (The Valour of Malta) about the maritime battles of the Order. In his portrait by Eugenio Caxés he wears the habit of the Order of Malta.

==Work==

Lope&#x27;s non-dramatic works were collected and published in Spain in the eighteenth century under the title &quot;Obras Sueltas&quot; (Madrid, 21 vols., 1776–79). The more important elements of this collection include the following:
*&quot;La Arcadia&quot; (1598), a pastoral romance;
*&quot;La Dragontea&quot; (1598), an epic poem of Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s last expedition and death;
*&quot;El Isidro&quot; (1599), a poetic narrative of the life of Saint Isidore, future patron saint of Madrid, composed in octosyllabic quintillas;
*&quot;La Hermosura de Angélica&quot; (1602), an epic poem in three books, is a quasi sequel to Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;.
Lope de Vega was one of the greatest Spanish poets of his time, along with Luis de Góngora and Francisco de Quevedo. His poems of Moorish and pastoral themes were extremely popular in the 1580s and 1590s, and in these, he portrayed elements of his own love affairs (appearing as a moor called Zaide or a shepherd called Belardo). In 1602 he published two hundred sonnets in the collection &quot;La Hermosura de Angélica&quot; and in 1604 he republished them with new material in &quot;Rimas&quot;. In 1614, his religious sonnets appeared in a book entitled &quot;Rimas sacras&quot;, which was another bestseller. In 1634, in a third book with similar title, &quot;Rimas humanas y divinas del licenciado Tomé de Burguillos&quot;, which has been considered his poetic masterpiece and the most modern book of 17th-century poetry, Lope created a heteronym, he concludes the identity of Tome de Burguillos, who has a deep and intimate romantic connection with a maid named Juana. This is a direct comparison and clash with Lope&#x27;s skeptical outlook on society. 

===Background===
Lope was the playwright who established in Spanish drama the three-act &quot;comedia&quot; as the definitive form, ignoring the precepts of the prevailing school of his contemporaries. In &quot;Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo&quot; (1609), which was his artistic manifesto and the justification of his style which broke the neoclassical three unities of place, time and action, he showed that he knew the established rules of poetry but refused to follow them on the grounds that the &quot;vulgar&quot; Spaniard cared nothing about them: &quot;Let us then speak to him in the language of fools, since it is he who pays us&quot; are famous lines from his manifesto. 

Lope boasted that he was a Spaniard &quot;pur sang&quot; (pure-blooded), maintaining that a writer&#x27;s business is to write so as to make himself understood, and took the position of a defender of the language of ordinary life.

Lope&#x27;s literary influence was chiefly Latin-Italian and, while he defended the tradition of the nation and the simplicity of the old Castilian, he emphasized his university education and the difference between those educated in the classics and the layman. 

The majority of his works were written in haste and to order. Lope confessed that &quot;more than a hundred of my comedies have taken only twenty-four hours to pass from the Muses to the boards of the theatre.&quot; His biographer Pérez de Montalbán tells how in Toledo, Lope composed fifteen acts in as many days – five comedies in two weeks.

In spite of some discrepancies in the figures, Lope&#x27;s own records indicate that by 1604 he had composed 230 three-act plays (&quot;comedias&quot;). The figure had risen to 483 by 1609, to 800 by 1618, to 1000 by 1620, and to 1500 by 1632. Montalbán, in his &quot;Fama Póstuma&quot; (1636) set down the total of Lope&#x27;s dramatic productions at 1800 &quot;comedias&quot; and more than 400 shorter sacramental plays. Of these, 637 plays are known by their titles, but only about 450 are extant. Many of these pieces were printed during Lope&#x27;s lifetime, mostly by the playwright himself in the shape of twelve-play volumes, but also by booksellers who surreptitiously bought manuscripts from the actors who performed them.

===Themes and sources===
The classification of this large mass of dramatic literature is a task of great difficulty. The terms traditionally employed – comedy, tragedy, and the like – are difficult to apply to Lope&#x27;s oeuvre and another approach to categorization has been suggested. Lope&#x27;s work essentially belongs to the drama of intrigue, the plot determining everything else. Lope used history, especially Spanish history, as his main source of subject matter. There were few national and patriotic subjects, from the reign of King Pelayo to the history of his own age, he did not put upon the stage. Nevertheless, Lope&#x27;s most celebrated plays belong to the class called &quot;capa y espada&quot; (&quot;cloak and dagger&quot;), where the plots are chiefly love intrigues along with affairs of honor, most commonly involving the petty nobility of medieval Spain.

Among the best known works of this class are &quot;El perro del hortelano&quot; (&quot;The Dog in the Manger&quot;), &quot;El castigo sin venganza&quot; (&quot;Punishment without Revenge&quot;), and &quot;El maestro de danzar&quot; (&quot;The Dance Teacher&quot;).

In some of these, Lope strives to set forth some moral maxim and to illustrate its abuse with a living example. On the theme that poverty is no crime, in the play &quot;Las Flores de Don Juan&quot;, he uses the history of two brothers to illustrate the triumph of virtuous poverty over opulent vice, while indirectly attacking the institution of primogeniture, which often places in the hands of an unworthy person the honor and substance of a family when younger members would be better qualified for the trust. However, such morality pieces are rare in Lope&#x27;s repertory; generally, his aim is to amuse and stir with his focus being on the plot, not concerning himself with instruction.

In &quot;El villano en su rincón&quot;, described as a romantic comedy, Francis I of France ends up spending the night in a &#x27;s hut, after becoming lost during a hunt, resulting in a confrontation between peasant-philosopher and king. The peasant&#x27;s refusal to even look upon the king&#x27;s magnificence, grand and dramatic compared with the humble &quot;rincón&quot;, is rebuked by a gentleman of the king&#x27;s court: &quot;a king of such might/that the Scythian and fierce Turk/tremble before his golden fleurs de lis!&quot;

===Legacy===
Lope encountered a poorly organized dramatic tradition; plays were sometimes composed in four acts, sometimes in three, and though they were written in verse, the structure of the versification was left to the individual writer. Because the Spanish public liked it, he adopted the style of drama which was then in vogue. He enlarged its narrow framework to a great degree, introducing a wide range of material for dramatic situations – the Bible, ancient mythology, the lives of the saints, ancient history, Spanish history, the legends of the Middle Ages, the writings of the Italian novelists, current events, and everyday Spanish life in the 17th century. Prior to Lope, playwrights sketched the conditions of persons and their characters superficially. With fuller observation and more careful description, Lope de Vega depicted real character types with language and accouterments appropriate to their position in society. The old comedy was awkward and poor in its versification. Lope introduced order into all the forms of national poetry, from the old romance couplets to the lyrical combinations borrowed from Italy. He wrote that those who should come after him had only to go on along the path which he had opened.

Lope de Vega encountered other poets who were unimpressed with his discoveries and attempted to defame his writing. The Spanish poet Pedro de Torres Rámila wrote his thoughts on Lope in his Latin satire &quot;Spongia&quot; (Paris, 1617). Torres wrote personal attacks on Lope&#x27;s sacramental plays and sought to scandalize his name and reputation. This attempt backfired on Torres due to the overwhelmingly negative responses his &quot;Spongia&quot; received from the public after its release. Scholars and poets alike came to the defense of Lope de Vega and wrote many counterclaims against the &quot;Spongia&quot; directed at Torres himself, like Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca&#x27;s &quot;Exposulatio Spongiae&quot;.

In January 2023, an anonymous work in the collection of the National Library of Spain, &quot;La francesa Laura&quot; (The Frenchwoman Laura), was identified with the help of artificial intelligence as another comedy by Lope de Vega. The comedy was classified as a late work of Lope de Vega and dated from 1628 to 1630, as its flattering treatment of France could be attributed to the momentary good relationship between Spain and France during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, having England as a common enemy. Later investigations by literary historians confirmed the findings of artificial intelligence.

== In popular culture ==
In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s alternate history novel &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot;, in which the Spanish Armada was successful, Vega is depicted as a Spanish soldier-playwright on occupation duty in defeated England, who interacts with William Shakespeare. The novel&#x27;s viewpoint narration alternates between the two playwrights.

A 2010 Spanish-language film about de Vega, entitled &quot;Lope&quot;, is available with English subtitles as &quot;The Outlaw&quot;.

Vega is played by actor Víctor Clavijo in the Spanish TV series &quot;El Ministerio del Tiempo&quot;. In his first appearance he played Vega in 1588, on the eve of the Spanish Armada, while the second episode depicted Vega in 1604.

==Tribute==
A municipality in Northern Samar in the Philippines was named after de Vega, created in 1980 from the 22 barangays of Catarmán.

A street in the Santa Cruz district of the City of Manila, Philippines is also named after the playwright.

On 25 November 2017 Google celebrated his 455th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<text>David&#x27;s Psalter (original Polish title: Psalterz Dawidow) is a poetic translation into Polish of the Book of Psalms, by Jan Kochanowski, the most prominent poet of the Polish Renaissance. It was printed in 1579 in Kraków, at the Lazarus printing house.

Kochanowski, like contemporaries in Western Europe, used a Latin translation of the Book of Psalms as the basis for his translation. Well versed in the ancient classics, he combined the original&#x27;s biblical spirit with the literary achievements of Greek and Latin authors. 

Kochanowski&#x27;s &quot;David&#x27;s Psalter&quot; won recognition from both Protestants and Catholics in Poland, and also resonated abroad, notably in the work of Moldavian Metropolitan Dosoftei. Some of Kochanowski&#x27;s renderings of the Psalms are still used in Polish Catholic masses.

By the mid-18th century alone, it had gone through at least 25 editions and, set to music, became an enduring element of Polish church masses and folklore. It also became one of his more influential works on the international scene, translated into Russian by Symeon of Polotsk and into, among other languages, Romanian, German, Lithuanian, Czech, and Slovak.

Norman Davies wrote that &quot;Kochanowski&#x27;s Psalter did for Polish what Luther&#x27;s Bible did for German&quot;.

&quot;David&#x27;s Psalter&quot; was Kochanowski&#x27;s first published collection of poems (in 1579).

<text>The great knot (Calidris tenuirostris) is a small wader. It is the largest species of the genus &quot;Calidris&quot;. They are a migratory bird which breeds in Siberia, Russia, and flies to southern Asia and Australia in the northern winter.

==Etymology==
The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot; tenuirostris &quot; is from Latin &quot;tenuis&quot; &quot;slender&quot; and &quot;rostrum&quot; &quot;bill&quot;.

==Distribution==
Their breeding habitat is tundra in northeast Siberia, Russia. They nest on the ground laying about four eggs in a ground scrape. They are strongly migratory wintering on coasts in southern Asia through to Australia. This species forms enormous flocks in winter. 

The species is also recorded in low numbers in western Alaska, United States, most years, and has occurred as a vagrant in British Columbia, Canada, and in Oregon, West Virginia, and Maine, in the U.S.

==Taxonomy and description==
&quot;Calidris tenuirostris&quot;, commonly known as the great knot, is the largest species of the genus &quot;Calidris&quot; (sandpiper), in the family Scolopacidae. Its sister species, the red knot, is the next largest. Adult great knots can measure , with a wingspan of , and weighing . 

This species has short dark legs and a medium-length thin dark bill. Breeding adults have mottled greyish upper parts with some rufous feathering. The face, throat and breast are heavily spotted black, and there are also some streaks on the rear belly. In winter the plumage becomes uniformly pale grey above. 

It is distinguished from the red knot by its breeding plumage, in which the latter has a distinctive red face, throat and breast. In other plumages, the great knot can be identified by its larger size, longer bill, deeper chest, and the more streaked upper parts.

==Behaviour==
These birds forage on mudflats and beaches, probing or picking up food by sight. They mainly eat molluscs and insects.

== Conservation status ==
The great knot is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.
=== Australia ===
Since 5 May 2016 and , the great knot is listed as critically endangered in Australia under the federal &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; (EPBC Act), with the next assessment due on 30 October 2023. A study published in &quot;Biological Conservation&quot; in March 2023 listed 23 species which the authors considered to no longer meet the criteria as threatened species under the EPBC Act, including the great knot. The reason for the assessment was &quot;Populations now stable or declining at a rate less than threshold&quot;.

Under state and territory legislation, the species is listed as vulnerable in New South Wales and the Northern Territory; endangered in South Australia; and critically endangered in Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia.

<text>Calidris is a genus of Arctic-breeding, strongly migratory wading birds in the family Scolopacidae. These birds form huge mixed flocks on coasts and estuaries in winter. Migratory shorebirds are shown to have decline in reproductive traits because of temporal changes of their breeding seasons. They are the typical &quot;sandpipers&quot;, small to medium-sized, long-winged and relatively short-billed.

Their bills have sensitive tips which contain numerous corpuscles of Herbst. This enables the birds to locate buried prey items, which they typically seek with restless running and probing.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Calidris&quot; was introduced in 1804 by the German naturalist Blasius Merrem with the red knot as the type species. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds.

The genus contain 24 species:

* Great knot, &quot;Calidris tenuirostris&quot;
* Red knot, &quot;Calidris canutus&quot;
* Surfbird, &quot;Calidris virgata&quot;
* Ruff, &quot;Calidris pugnax&quot;
* Broad-billed sandpiper, &quot;Calidris falcinellus&quot;
* Sharp-tailed sandpiper, &quot;Calidris acuminata&quot;
* Stilt sandpiper, &quot;Calidris himantopus&quot;
* Curlew sandpiper, &quot;Calidris ferruginea&quot;
* Temminck&#x27;s stint, &quot;Calidris temminckii&quot;
* Long-toed stint, &quot;Calidris subminuta&quot;
* Spoon-billed sandpiper, &quot;Calidris pygmaea&quot;
* Red-necked stint, &quot;Calidris ruficollis&quot;
* Sanderling, &quot;Calidris alba&quot;
* Dunlin, &quot;Calidris alpina&quot;
* Rock sandpiper, &quot;Calidris ptilocnemis&quot;
* Purple sandpiper, &quot;Calidris maritima&quot;
* Baird&#x27;s sandpiper, &quot;Calidris bairdii&quot;
* Little stint, &quot;Calidris minuta&quot;
* Least sandpiper, &quot;Calidris minutilla&quot;
* White-rumped sandpiper, &quot;Calidris fuscicollis&quot;
* Buff-breasted sandpiper, &quot;Calidris subruficollis&quot;
* Pectoral sandpiper, &quot;Calidris melanotos&quot;
* Semipalmated sandpiper, &quot;Calidris pusilla&quot;
* Western sandpiper, &quot;Calidris mauri&quot;
