<text>The bolívar is the official currency of Venezuela. Named after the hero of South American independence Simón Bolívar, it was introduced by President Guzman Blanco via the monetary reform of 1879, before which the venezolano was circulating. Due to its decades-long reliance on silver and gold standards, and then on a peg to the United States dollar, it was long considered among the most stable currencies.

Since 1983, the currency has experienced a prolonged period of high inflation, losing value almost 500-fold against the US dollar in the process. The depreciation became manageable in the mid-2000s, but it still stayed in double digits. It was then, on 1 January 2008, that the hard bolívar (&quot;bolívar fuerte&quot; in Spanish, sign: Bs.F, code: VEF) replaced the original bolívar (sign: Bs; code: VEB) at a rate of Bs.F 1 to Bs. 1,000 (the abbreviation Bs. is due to the first and the final letters of the plural form of the currency&#x27;s name, &quot;bolívares&quot;).

The value of the hard bolívar, pegged to the US dollar, did not stay stable for long despite attempts to institute capital controls. Venezuela entered another period of abnormally high inflation in 2012, which the country has not exited . The central bank stuck to the pegged subsidised exchange rate until January 2018, which was overpriced so people began using parallel exchange rates despite a ban on publishing them. From 2016 to 2019 and again in 2020, the currency experienced hyperinflation for a total period of 38 months.

The rampant inflation prompted another two redenominations. The first occurred in August 2018, when Bs.F 100,000 were exchanged for 1 sovereign bolívar (&quot;bolívar soberano&quot; in Spanish, sign: Bs.S, code: VES). The second one, dubbed the &quot;nueva expresión monetaria&quot; or new monetary expression, occurred on 1 October 2021, when Bs.S 1,000,000 were exchanged for 1 digital bolívar (&quot;bolívar digital&quot; in Spanish, sign: Bs.D, code: VED), thus making Bs.D 1 worth Bs. 100,000,000,000,000 (1014, or Bs. 100 trillion in short scale).

Both Bs.S and Bs.D currencies are officially in circulation, though the economy has undergone extensive currency substitution, so the majority of transactions happen in US dollars, or, to a lesser extent, the Colombian peso.

==History==

===Bolívar===



The bolívar is named after the hero of South American independence Simón Bolívar. The bolívar was introduced by President Guzman Blanco, who around one hundred years after Simón Bolívar&#x27;s birth, undertook various projects to honour his contribution to Venezuelan history. The coin appeared in the monetary law of 1879, replacing the short-lived venezolano at a rate of five bolívares to one venezolano. Initially, the bolívar was defined on the silver standard, equal to 4.5 g fine silver, following the principles of the Latin Monetary Union. The monetary law of 1887 made the gold bolívar unlimited legal tender, and the gold standard came into full operation in 1910. Venezuela went off gold in 1930, and in 1934, the bolívar exchange rate was fixed in terms of the US dollar at a rate of Bs. 3.914 = US$1, revalued to Bs. 3.18 = 1 US dollar in 1937, a rate which lasted until 1941. Until 18 February 1983 (now called &quot;Viernes Negro&quot;, Spanish for Black Friday, by many Venezuelans), the bolívar had been the region&#x27;s most stable and internationally accepted currency. It then fell prey to high devaluation.

Exchange controls were imposed on February 5, 2003, to limit capital flight. The rate was pegged to the US dollar at a fixed exchange rate of Bs. 1,600 to the dollar.

===Hard bolívar===



The government announced on 7 March 2007 that the bolívar would be redenominated at a ratio of 1,000 to 1 on 1 January 2008 and renamed the &quot;bolívar fuerte&quot;, or &quot;hard bolívar&quot; in an effort to facilitate the ease of transaction and accounting. The newer name literally means &quot;hard bolívar&quot;, as in hard currency, and in reference to an old coin called the &quot;peso fuerte&quot; worth 10 Spanish reales. The alternate meaning of &quot;strong&quot; was also used by the government in promotional material The official exchange rate is restricted to individuals by CADIVI, which imposes an annual limit on the amount available for travel.

Since the government of Hugo Chávez established strict currency controls in 2003, there have been a series of five currency devaluations, disrupting the economy. On 8 January 2010, the value was changed by the government from the fixed exchange rate of Bs.F 2.15 to Bs.F 2.60 for some imports (certain foods and healthcare goods) and Bs.F 4.30 for other imports like cars, petrochemicals, and electronics. On 4 January 2011, the fixed exchange rate became Bs.F 4.30 for US$1.00 for both sides of the economy. On 13 February 2013 the hard bolívar was devalued to Bs.F 6.30 per US$1 in an attempt to counter budget deficits. On 18 February 2016, President Maduro used his newly granted economic powers to devalue the official exchange rate of the hard bolívar from Bs.F 6.30 per US$1 to Bs.F 10 per US$1, which is a 37% depreciation against the US dollar.

The hard bolívar entered hyperinflation in November 2016.

On January 26, 2018, the government retired the protected and subsidized Bs.F 10 per US$1 exchange rate that was highly overvalued as a result of rampant inflation. On February 5, 2018, the Central Bank of Venezuela announced a devaluation, with the exchange rate going to Bs.F 25,000 per US$. This made the hard bolívar the second-least-valued circulating currency in the world based on the official exchange rate, behind only the Iranian rial, and between September 2017 and August 2018, according to the informal exchange rate, the hard bolívar was the least-valued circulating currency unit in the world.

The official exchange rate stood at Bs.F 248,832 to US$1 as of August 10, 2018, making it the least-valued circulating currency in the world based on official exchange rates.

In June 2018, the government authorized a new exchange rate for buying, but not selling, currency. On August 13, 2018, the rate was Bs.F 4,010,000 to US$1, according to ZOOM Remesas.

===Sovereign bolívar ===

On 22 March 2018, President Nicolás Maduro announced a new monetary reform program, with a planned revaluation of the currency at a ratio of 1,000 to 1. The change was to be made effective from 4 June 2018.

In May 2018, the government required prices to be expressed in both hard bolívares and sovereign bolívares at the then-planned rate of 1,000 to 1. For example, one kilogram of pasta was shown with a price of Bs.F 695,000 and Bs.S 695. Prices expressed in the new currency were rounded to the nearest 50 céntimos as that was expected to be the lowest denomination in circulation at launch. The rounding created difficulties because some items and sales qualities were priced at significantly less than Bs.S 0.50; for example a litre of gasoline and a Caracas Metro ticket typically cost Bs.S 0.06 and Bs.S 0.04, respectively.
The change in currency was originally scheduled for June 4, 2018. The President delayed the planned June launch date of the sovereign bolívar, citing from Aristides Maza, &quot;the period established to carry out the conversion is not enough&quot;. The revaluation was rescheduled to 20 August 2018, and the rate changed to 100,000 to 1, with prices being required to be expressed at the new rate starting 1 August 2018.

On 20 August 2018, the Maduro government launched the new sovereign bolívar currency, with Bs.S 1 worth Bs.F 100,000. New coins in denominations of 50 céntimos and Bs.S 1, and new banknotes in denominations of Bs.S 2, Bs.S 5, Bs.S 10, Bs.S 20, Bs.S 50, Bs.S 100, Bs.S 200 and Bs.S 500 were introduced. Under the country&#x27;s official fixed exchange rate to the US dollar the new currency was devalued by roughly 95% compared to the old hard bolívar. The day was declared a bank holiday to allow the banks to adjust to the new currency. Initially, during a transition period the sovereign bolívar was to be run alongside the hard bolívar. However, from the start of the transition, on 20 August, hard bolívar notes of Bs.F 500 and less could not be used; only deposited at banks.

Concurrently with the release of the new currency, the minimum wage was raised to Bs.S 1,800 per month, a 33-fold increase, and sales tax increased from 12% to 16%.

Additionally, the sovereign bolívar was supposed to have a fixed exchange rate to the petro cryptocurrency, with a rate of Bs.S 3,600 to one petro; a peg of petro and sovereign bolívar was announced by Maduro as early as August 2018. The petro was supposedly tied to the price of a barrel of oil (about US$60 in August 2018). As of the end of August 2018, there was no evidence that the cryptocurrency was being traded. Petro was regarded by many as a scam.
On January 15, 2024, Petro was shut down and any remaining holdings were liquidated.

Following the introduction of the sovereign bolívar, inflation increased from 61,463% on 21 August 2018 to 65,320% on 22 August 2018. By 24 August 2018, the introduction of the sovereign bolívar had not prevented hyperinflation. According to inflation analyst Steve Hanke, between 18 August and 21 August 2018, the inflation rate increased from 48,760% to 65,320%. In October 2021, the country removed six zeroes from its currency while adapting a newer version of the bolivar currency system under a project known as &quot;Digital bolivar&quot;.

===Digital bolívar===
The &quot;bolívar digital&quot;, lit. &quot;digital bolívar&quot; was introduced on 1 October 2021 at a rate of Bs.S 1,000,000 to 1 digital bolívar. Since its announcement, the Central Bank has used the abbreviation &quot;Bs.&quot; (i.e., not &quot;Bs.D&quot;) in examples of prices marked in digital bolívares.

The digital bolívar did not replace the sovereign bolívar, since sovereign bolívar banknotes continued to be accepted at a ratio of 1 million to 1. For example, the Bs.S 500,000 banknote is worth 0.50 digital bolívars, an amount which can also be referred to as 50 céntimos of a digital bolívar.

From October 1, 2021 through 27 April 2022 retailers were required to post prices in both sovereign and digital bolívars, By 2024, however it was more common to see prices posted in &quot;REF&quot; (or &quot;Ref&quot;, &quot;ref&quot;, etc.), an abbreviation for the word &quot;&quot;, representing a price in U.S. dollars, which customers can pay in digital and/or sovereign bolívars at the current rate of exchange.
==Currency black market==
The black (or parallel) market value of the &quot;hard bolívar&quot; and the &quot;sovereign bolívar&quot; has been significantly lower than the fixed exchange rate and other rates set by the Venezuelan government (SICAD, SIMADI, DICOM). In November 2013, it was almost one-tenth that of the official fixed exchange rate of Bs.F 6.30 per US dollar. In September 2014, the currency black market rate for the hard bolívar reached 100 VEF/USD; on 25 February 2015, it went over 200 VEF/USD. on 7 May 2015, it was over 275 VEF/USD and on 22 September 2015, it was over 730 VEF/USD. Venezuela still had the highest inflation rate in the world in July 2015. By 3 February 2016, this rate reached 1,000 VEF/USD. This rate surpassed 4,300 VEF/USD on 10 December 2016. It surpassed 10,000 VEF/USD on 28 July 2017, and on 7 September 2017, the rate surpassed 20,000 VEF/USD for the first time. Inflation accelerated, and on 1 December 2017, it reached 100,000 VEF/USD for the first time ever. The rate surpassed 200,000 VEF/USD on 18 January 2018, then 500,000 VEF/USD on 16 April, 1 million VEF/USD on 30 May, 2 million VEF/USD on 7 June, and 5 million VEF/USD on 16 August.

At the time of redenomination on 20 August 2018, the exchange rate was 59.21 VES/USD. By the end of the month it reached 87 VES/USD. The rate then surpassed 100 VES/USD on 3 October 2018, 1,000 VES/USD on 9 January 2019, 10,000 VES/USD on 19 July, 100,000 VES/USD on 6 April 2020, and reached the 1,000,000 VES/USD on 23 November 2020. According to DolarToday, the parallel exchange rate was 4,146,022 VES/USD as of 30 August 2021.

===Exchange rate history===
It is illegal to publish the &quot;parallel exchange rate&quot; in Venezuela. One website that has been publishing parallel exchange rates since 2010 is DolarToday, which has also been critical of the Maduro government. This table shows a condensed history of the parallel foreign exchange rate of the Venezuelan bolívar (hard and sovereign) to one United States dollar between 2012 and 2021, according to DolarToday.


==Coins==

===Bolívar===
In 1879, silver coins were introduced in denominations of Bs. , Bs. , Bs. 1, Bs. 2, and Bs. 5, together with gold Bs. 20. Gold Bs. 100 were also issued between 1886 and 1889. In 1894, silver Bs.  coins were introduced, followed by cupro-nickel 5 and céntimos in 1896.

In 1912, production of gold coins ceased, whilst production of the Bs.5 ended in 1936. In 1965, nickel replaced silver in the 25 and 50 céntimos, with the same happening to the 1 and 2 bolívares in 1967. In 1971, cupro-nickel 10 céntimo coins were issued, the céntimos having last been issued in 1958. A nickel Bs. 5 was introduced in 1973. Clad steel (first copper, then nickel and cupro-nickel) was used for the 5 céntimos from 1974. Nickel clad steel was introduced for all denominations from 25 céntimos up to 5 bolívares in 1989.

In 1998, after a period of high inflation, a new coinage was introduced in denominations of Bs. 10, Bs. 20, Bs. 50, Bs. 100 and Bs. 500.

The former coins were:

All the coins had the same design. On the obverse the left profile of the &quot;Libertador&quot; Simón Bolívar is depicted, along with the inscription &quot;Bolívar Libertador&quot; within a heptagon, symbolizing the seven stars of the flag. On the reverse the coat of arms is depicted, circled by the official name of the country, with the date and the denomination below. In 2001, the reverse design was changed, putting the denomination of the coin at the right of the shield of the coat of arms, surrounded in a semicircle by the official name of the country and the year of its issue below.

===Hard bolívar===
Coins of the hard bolívar were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, , 25, 50 céntimos, and Bs.F 1. They were quickly rendered obsolete by high inflation. It may be noticed that there was a -céntimo coin and a 1-céntimo coin, but no -céntimo coin. Therefore, giving correct change for a purchase of, say, céntimos would require using a -céntimo coin and getting 8 céntimos back.

In December 2016, it was announced that coins of Bs.F 10, Bs.F 50, and Bs.F 100 would enter circulation. These three coins would replace the banknotes of the same denominations.

===Sovereign bolívar===
Sovereign bolívar coins were announced to be produced in denominations of 50 céntimos and Bs.S 1 (Bs.F 50,000 and Bs.F 100,000 respectively). These two coins were worthless by September 2019.
===Digital bolívar===
Coins of the Digital bolívar were issued on October 1, 2021 in denominations of 25 and 50 céntimos and 1 bolívar. The coins were introduced along with the redenomination of the currency from the Sovereign bolívar to the Digital bolívar. 
==Banknotes==

===Bolívar===
In 1940, the Banco Central de Venezuela began issuing paper money, introducing denominations of Bs. 10, Bs. 20, Bs. 50, Bs. 100 and Bs. 500. Bs. 5 notes were issued between 1966 and 1974, when they were replaced by coins. In 1989, notes for Bs. 1, Bs. 2 and Bs. 5 were issued.

As inflation took hold, higher denominations of banknotes started being introduced: Bs. 1,000 in 1991, Bs. 2,000 and Bs. 5,000 in 1994, and Bs. 10,000, Bs. 20,000 and Bs. 50,000 in 1998. The first Bs. 20,000 banknotes were made in a green color similar to the one of the Bs. 2,000 banknotes, which caused confusion, and new banknotes were made in a new olive green color.

Starting from 2000, banknotes ranging from Bs. 5,000 to Bs. 50,000 were renamed to &quot;REPÚBLICA BOLIVARIANA DE VENEZUELA&quot; instead of &quot;BANCO CENTRAL DE VENEZUELA&quot; on the obverse, after the 1999 constitution was adopted. Moreover, banknotes of Bs. 10,000, Bs. 20,000 and Bs. 50,000 were updated in April 2006 after the National Assembly approved changes to the coat of arms, which were made official on March 12, 2006.

The following is a list of former Venezuelan bolívar banknotes:

===Hard bolívar (bolívar fuerte, Bs.F, VEF)===

====2008–2016 (&quot;2007&quot;)====
New banknotes of the series 2007–2015 with values of Bs.F 2 to Bs.F 100 were issued from 20 March 2007 until 5 November 2015 and became legal tender from 1 January 2008 to 20 August 2018. The greater the values, the longer re-issuing occurred. Only the Bs.F 50 and Bs.F 100 notes were re-issued in November 2015.

* Bs.F 2: March 20, 2007 to October 29, 2013
* Bs.F 5: March 20, 2007 to August 19, 2014
* Bs.F 10: March 20, 2007 to August 19, 2014
* Bs.F 20: March 20, 2007 to August 19, 2014
* Bs.F 50: March 20, 2007 to November 5, 2015
* Bs.F 100: March 20, 2007 to November 5, 2015

The obverse side is portrait-oriented, with the lower half carrying a portrait, while the reverse side is landscape-oriented, the left two thirds showing an animal in front of its habitat.

Re-issues retain the value-specific motifs, but the printing quality is different. The notes are printed by &quot;Casa de la Moneda Venezuela&quot; in Venezuela.

====2016–17====
High inflation, which was a part of Venezuela&#x27;s economic collapse, caused the hard bolívar&#x27;s value to plummet. The Bs.F 2 and Bs.F 5 notes were no longer found in circulation due to the hyperinflation, but remained legal tender. By December 2016, the Bs.F 100 note, the largest denomination, was only worth about US$0.23 on the black market.

On 7 December 2016, a new series of banknotes (recolors of the previous notes) in denominations of Bs.F 500, Bs.F 1,000, Bs.F 2,000, Bs.F 5,000, Bs.F 10,000, and Bs.F 20,000 were unveiled to the Venezuelan public. Days later on 11 December, President Nicolás Maduro who had been ruling by decree wrote into law that the Bs.F 100 would be pulled from circulation within 72 hours because &quot;mafias&quot; were allegedly storing those particular notes to drive inflation. With more than 6 billion Bs.F 100 notes issued consisting of 46% of Venezuela&#x27;s issued currency, Maduro enacted an exchange for Venezuelan citizens to transfer all Bs.F 100 notes for Bs.F 100 coins while also blocking international travel to prevent the return of the bolívares that were supposedly stockpiled. The government justified the move claiming that the United States was working with crime syndicates to spirit away Venezuela&#x27;s paper money to warehouses in Europe to cause the fall of the government. The government was thwarting this threat by withdrawing the notes from circulation. On 14 February 2017, Paraguayan authorities uncovered a 30-tonne stash of Bs.F 50 and Bs.F 100 notes totaling Bs.F 1.5 billion on its Brazilian border that had not yet been circulated. According to a United States Department of Defense adviser linked to The Pentagon, the Bs.F 1.5 billion was printed by Venezuela and destined for Bolivia, since unlike the implied exchange rate of thousands of hard bolívares equaling one United States dollar, the exchange rate was approximately 10 hard bolívares per dollar, making the value of the stash 419 times stronger, from US$358,000 to US$150 million. The Pentagon adviser further stated that the Venezuelan government tried to send the newly printed notes to be exchanged by the Bolivian government so Bolivia could pay 20% of its debt to Venezuela, and so Venezuela could use the US dollars for its own disposal.

On 3 November 2017, the Banco Central de Venezuela issued a Bs.F 100,000 note which is similar to the Bs.F 100 note of the 2007 series and the Bs.F 20,000 of the 2016 series, but with the denomination spelled out in full instead of adding an additional three zeros to the number 100. This denomination was worth US$2.42 using the unofficial exchange rate at the date of its release.

New banknotes of the 2016–17 series with values of Bs.F 500 to Bs.F 100,000 were issued from 7 December 2016 until 20 August 2018, the day when the sovereign bolívar was introduced. Notes from Bs.F 5,000 to Bs.F 100,000 were recently re-issued in December 2017.

* Bs.F 500: August 18, 2016 to March 23, 2017
* Bs.F 1,000: August 18, 2016 to March 23, 2017
* Bs.F 2,000: August 18, 2016
* Bs.F 5,000: August 18, 2016 to December 13, 2017
* Bs.F 10,000: August 18, 2016 to December 13, 2017
* Bs.F 20,000: August 18, 2016 to December 13, 2017
* Bs.F 100,000: September 7, 2017 to December 13, 2017,

Maduro announced that after the currency redenomination was carried out on 20 August 2018, these old denominations with a face value of 1,000 hard bolívares or higher would circulate in parallel with the new series of sovereign bolívar notes for a limited time. Banknotes with a face value below BsF. 1,000 were withdrawn from circulation and ceased to be legal tender on 20 August 2018. They had to be deposited in local banks.

====2018====
By May 2018, the hard bolívar&#x27;s banknotes represented very little value and they had become in short supply. Weighing scales could no longer convert mass to price and receipts could no longer fit the numbers on their paper.

In June 2018, seven months after its release, the value of the Bs.F 100,000 note (largest denomination), had its value reduced by 98%, from US$2.42 (in November 2017) to US$0.05, as a result of increasing hyperinflation.

The lower denomination hard bolívar banknotes (up to Bs.F 500) were demonetized on 20 August 2018; with the introduction of the sovereign bolívar. Higher denominations (Bs.F 1,000 and above) remained legal tender during a transition period. On 30 November 2018, it was announced that the remaining denominations of the old currency will be withdrawn from circulation and cease to be legal tender on 5 December 2018.

===Sovereign bolívar===

====2018====
On 22 March 2018, with a declared state of emergency, a redenomination of the currency was announced. The conversion from hard bolívar to sovereign bolívar banknotes officially occurred on 20 August 2018, with new denominations of Bs.S 2, Bs.S 5, Bs.S 10, Bs.S 20, Bs.S 50, Bs.S 100, Bs.S 200, and Bs.S 500. Four months after entry into circulation, shops and state banks began refusing the Bs.S 2, as its value had significantly declined since the redenomination. By November 2019, except for the Bs.S 500, all notes issued in 2018 were worthless.

====2019====
Further inflation since the soberano redenomination resulted in the creation of Bs.S 10,000, Bs.S 20,000 and Bs.S 50,000 banknotes in June 2019. Not mentioning inflation, the Central Bank of Venezuela said the introduction of the new banknotes would &quot;complement and optimize&quot; the monetary system and that their purpose was to make payment systems &quot;more efficient&quot;. On 23 April 2020, the exchange rate per xe.com was US$1 = 144,697.34 VES; the following day, the rate slid to US$1 = Bs.S 171,140.42.

Banknotes with a narrow segmented security thread were printed by Goznak, those with a wider one were printed elsewhere.

Banknotes of Bs. 10,000, Bs. 20,000, Bs. 50,000, and Bs. 200,000 of the sovereign bolívar will be withdrawn from circulation and cease being legal tender on 25 September 2024.

====2020====
As of December 2020, the highest denomination banknote (Bs.S 50,000) was worth less than US$0.05 and the minimum wage is Bs.S 1,200,000 (about US$1) per month. By September 2020, all sovereign bolivar banknotes (Bs.S 2 to Bs.S 500) issued on 20 August 2018 were deemed worthless. Venezuelan officials are planning a new Bs.S 100,000 note. Meanwhile, as of 16 December 2020, the exchange rate was over 1 million bolivares to one US dollar.

====2021====
On 5 March 2021, the Central Bank of Venezuela introduced 3 new denominations: Bs.S 200,000, Bs.S 500,000 and Bs.S 1,000,000 which were made available to the general public on 8 March 2021. The Bs.S 1,000,000 note was only worth US$0.52 at the time of the announcement.

By late May 2021 the exchange rate had risen to over 3 million sovereign bolívares to one US dollar.

According to a July 2021 &quot;Bloomberg article&quot;, Venezuela plans to redenominate the bolívar at a ratio of 1,000,000:1 in August 2021, effectively removing six zeros from the denominations. The current largest denomination banknote is 1,000,000 bolívares, expressed on the note with a predominant 1 followed by the descriptive &quot;millón de bolívares&quot;. It is therefore likely that the bank intends to retain the bolívar currency name while reusing the existing note designs.

===Digital bolívar===
Banknotes of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 digital bolívares were introduced in 2021, all bearing similar motifs but different colors.

In August 2024, banknotes of 200 and 500 bolívares were introduced.

<doc id="383938" wikidata="Q11818861" url="?curid=383938" title="Fifteen (TV series)">
<text>Fifteen (known as Hillside in Canada) is a teen drama television series that aired on YTV in Canada and on Nickelodeon from 1991 to 1993. Created and produced by John T. Binkley, the series was Nickelodeon&#x27;s only teenage soap opera. The show was shot on videotape, similar to most daytime dramas.

The series was first conceived as &quot;Hillside&quot; in an improvised form for The Disney Channel, where a 13-episode pilot series was produced and tested in the United States. After Disney decided not to proceed with the project, Nickelodeon and Canadian partners joined Binkley in producing the series; which was known in its first and second seasons as &quot;Hillside&quot; in Canada, and throughout the 65-episode run as &quot;Fifteen&quot; in the United States.

The show was subsequently syndicated around the world, with runs in Germany and Israel, among others. Rerun rights are held by the Peter Rodgers Organization, which has made the first season available for free on Prime Video.

The series features a large ensemble cast that underwent several changes over the show&#x27;s four-season run. Notable cast members include Laura Harris, Enuka Okuma, and Ryan Reynolds (Reynolds later admitted to disliking working on the show so much that he briefly considered quitting acting altogether).

==Plot==
&quot;Fifteen&quot; followed the students of fictional Hillside School and dealt with a variety of issues including dating, divorce, alcohol abuse, infidelity and friendship. The show played heavily into stereotypes, including two characters named Dylan and Chris, who wore leather jackets to show off their toughness, but which could not completely disguise their inner selves. At one point, they play a gig with their band Teenagers in Love at the local eatery and hangout spot The Avalon.

==Cast and characters==
* Laura Harris as Ashley Frasier – Ashley is a soft-spoken honor student who struggles to balance academic expectations with personal relationships. Though considered wholesome, she occasionally makes bad decisions to spite her image. She&#x27;s the longtime on-again, off-again girlfriend of Matt Walker.
* Todd Talbot as Matt Walker – The captain and star player of the school&#x27;s basketball team, Matt struggles with substance abuse throughout the series which harms his relationships and school reputation. He loves Ashley, but he and she continue to break up. They finally break up for good and he moves away. 
*Ryan Reynolds as Billy Simpson – The younger brother of Courtney, Billy frequently hangs around Dylan and looks up to him. After facing family problems and personal betrayal (as well as numerous romantic rejections), Billy turns to bullying to mask his emotions. An intervention from Dylan finally gets through to Billy and he makes amends for his bullying streak.
*Chris William Martin as Dylan Blackwell – The mysterious rebel of the school, Dylan aspires to become a musician. He&#x27;s often stuck managing conflict within his band, has a troubled relationship with his parents and later drops out of school. He had a fractious rivalry with Matt at first, but they became friends as the series went on. He and Ashley have feelings for each other and finally explore them. 
*Robyn Ross as Brooke Morgan (seasons 1–3) – Brooke is the self-centered and mean-spirited antagonist who often inserts herself into other&#x27;s business where it&#x27;s not warranted. She is arrogant, spiteful, cruel, and manipulative, but her self-centered ways come back to haunt her on more than one occasion. She&#x27;s at odds with her sisters, whom their father seems to favor more than her. Brooke eventually leaves in the third season and moves to France.
*Sarah Douglas as Courtney Simpson (seasons 1–3) – Courtney is the modest best friend of Ashley. She navigates a difficult relationship with her brother Billy during their parent&#x27;s separation. She tends to be naive and meek at times.
* Ken Angel as Jake Deosdade (seasons 1 and 3) – Jake is a good friend to many students at Hillside but fancies Courtney in particular. He has feelings for Courtney and the two eventually start dating. Absent in China through season 2, Jake returns to Hillside for season 3. He is also Matt&#x27;s best friend.
* Enuka Okuma as Kelly (season 1) – Brooke&#x27;s equally cunning friend. Friction begins when Brooke has Kelly take the blame for a scheme against Ashley that they both conspired on. Kelly plots revenge on Brooke with the help of her sister, Theresa. Their friendship dissolves because of it. Kelly disappears without explanation after Season 1.
* Janine Cox as Theresa Morgan (season 1) – Brooke&#x27;s little sister. Unlike Brooke, Theresa is kind-hearted and sensitive. She begins to lose respect for her sibling after seeing how she uses people for her own ends. She has a crush on Dylan. She aids Kelly in her revenge plot against Brooke. Theresa never appears again after Season 1, but unlike Kelly, who vanished and was never mentioned again, Theresa is said to be attending a prestigious art school in Season 2 by Brooke.
* Aubrey Nealon as Olaf (season 1) – A transfer student from Finland ostracized by most of the students. He often struggles to find the right word to describe his circumstances. He is a chess fanatic and friends with Billy.
* Ahnee Boyce as Cyndi (season 1) – An activist for environmental causes who is frustrated with the lack of concern from students. Strong-willed, assertive, but friendly, Cyndi wasn&#x27;t afraid to speak her mind or put people like Brooke in their place when she had to.
* Roxanne Alexander as Roxanne Lee (seasons 2–4) – Roxanne is an associate of Chris who displays a tough exterior and is often the catalyst for dissent within Dylan&#x27;s band. Chris has feelings for her and wants to be in a band with her. Roxanne shows a more vulnerable side during Season 4 when it was revealed she was a victim of abuse at the hands of her father.
*Andrew Baskin as Chris McDonald (seasons 2–4) – A troubled youth often at odds with others, especially Dylan. He plays guitar and aspires to be a rock star. Seen as a hoodlum, he later makes a genuine attempt to change his ways and develops feelings for Ashley.

After seemingly losing everything and accepting his fate as an outcast, he turns around when Russ makes a genuine attempt to befriend him. 
*Lisa Warner as Stacy Collins (seasons 2–4) – An awkward and timid girl who begins an unlikely friendship with Brooke. While she initially looks up to Brooke and aspires to be her friend, Stacy begins to tire of her attitude. She then begins to do the same towards Roxanne. 
*David Wight as David O&#x27;Brien (seasons 2–4) – The student manager/trainer of the basketball team. While a bit shy, Dave doesn&#x27;t hesitate to stand up for himself or others when provoked. He especially looks up to Matt.
* Arseman Yohannes as Arseman Harrell (seasons 2–4) – Arseman is a cheerful, candid person who often lends other students advice or a kind ear.

*Rekha Shah as Janice (season 2) – An overly eager and awkward new transfer student who has difficulty making friends upon her arrival. She eventually befriends Courtney and Arseman, but is then accused by Brooke of stealing an heirloom necklace of Courtney&#x27;s, is shunned by her classmates, and decides to transfer schools again. It turns out Brooke&#x27;s sister Amanda, not Janice, was the thief, and Courtney and Janice reconcile, though not before Janice transfers out of Hillside.

<text>Fred Luther Foster (July 26, 1931 – February 20, 2019) was an American record producer, songwriter, and music business executive who founded Monument Records and Combine Music. As a record producer he was most closely associated with Roy Orbison, and was also involved in the early careers of Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Foster suggested to Kris Kristofferson the title and theme of &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;, which became a hit for Kristofferson, Roger Miller, and Janis Joplin, and for which Foster received a co-writing credit.

==Career==
===Early career===
Foster left his family&#x27;s farm in North Carolina at the age of 18 and moved near his sister&#x27;s family in Washington, D.C., where he got a job working for the Hot Shoppes restaurant chain. While at work, he met popular area country music entertainer Billy Strickland, who invited Foster to one of his shows and sparked Foster&#x27;s interest in songwriting. Foster began working for J&amp;F Distributing Co. in Baltimore, where he launched the company&#x27;s pop division. He started recording local acts, and supervised Jimmy Dean&#x27;s debut hit, &quot;Bumming Around&quot;.

In 1953 he started to work for Mercury Records, but clashed with the company&#x27;s executives over his endorsement of rockabilly acts. In late 1955, he unsuccessfully tried to convince Fred Talmadge, Mercury&#x27;s Marketing Director, to sign the 20 year old Elvis Presley, then still at Sun Records but with competing offers from both Atlantic and RCA Records. Foster then briefly joined ABC-Paramount, where he acquired the rights to George Hamilton IV&#x27;s recording, &quot;A Rose and a Baby Ruth&quot;, which became the company&#x27;s first million-seller, and also signed Lloyd Price to the label.

===Monument Records, Combine Music, and success===

After working in record promotions for several years, in March 1958 Foster co-founded Monument Records and publishing company Combine Music with business manager Jack Kirby and well-known Baltimore disc jockey &quot;Buddy&quot; Deane. Founded in Washington, D.C., the label&#x27;s name was inspired by the Washington Monument.

For the label&#x27;s first release, Foster took Billy Grammer to RCA&#x27;s Nashville studio to record &quot;Gotta Travel On&quot; with Chet Atkins. Having spent all but $80 of Monument&#x27;s initial $1,200 of funding to record the song, Foster negotiated for Monument to be the first label distributed by London Records. Grammer&#x27;s single, released in October 1958, was a crossover hit, reaching #4 on the U.S. pop chart, #5 on the U.S. country chart, and #14 on the U.S. R&amp;B chart in 1959, selling over 900,000 copies. It also spawned a nationwide dance craze called &quot;The Shag&quot;, and Foster and Dick Flood co-wrote &quot;The Shag (Is Totally Cool)&quot; by Billy Graves which reached number 53 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100. Later that year, Monument co-founder &quot;Buddy&quot; Dean sold his 30% share of the company back to Foster.

In early 1959 Roy Orbison&#x27;s manager and Acuff-Rose president Wesley Rose approached Foster about signing the singer to Monument Records, and Foster said yes. As Orbison began recording for the label, his signature sound was realized, leading to a string of 18 hit singles and five best-selling LPs, beginning with the 1960 release &quot;Only the Lonely.&quot; Foster is credited for his part in the development of Roy Orbison&#x27;s career and for producing Orbison&#x27;s early hits, including &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; – his breakthrough hit – &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot;, &quot;Running Scared&quot;, &quot;In Dreams&quot;, &quot;Crying&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;, &quot;Mean Woman Blues&quot;, &quot;Pretty Paper&quot;, and &quot;Blue Bayou&quot;. Writer Richie Unterberger has compared Foster to more widely known producers such as Phil Spector and Leiber and Stoller, for the way in which he expanded the range of instrumentation used on pop and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll records, using orchestration and choirs of vocalists, as well as making extensive use of Nashville A-Team session musicians such as Charlie McCoy and Jerry Kennedy.

Recognizing he was spending more than half of his time in Nashville for recording sessions with Monument artists, Foster relocated Monument Records and Combine Music to Hendersonville. in 1960. In 1963, Foster expanded his label, forming the soul and R&amp;B imprint Sound Stage 7. Its roster of artists included Joe Simon, the Dixie Belles, Arthur Alexander, and Ivory Joe Hunter.

From Orbison&#x27;s departure from Monument in 1965, Foster worked mainly with country musicians. He played a significant role in Dolly Parton&#x27;s early career, signing her to Monument in 1964, shortly after her arrival in Nashville, and overseeing her recordings, culminating with her first top-40 country hit, &quot;Dumb Blonde&quot;, in 1967. Foster also produced recordings by Willie Nelson, Ray Stevens, Kris Kristofferson, Tony Joe White, Larry Gatlin, Charlie McCoy, Al Hirt, Boots Randolph, Jeannie Seely, Jerry Byrd, Billy Joe Shaver, Grandpa Jones, the Velvets, and Robert Mitchum. Foster suggested to Kris Kristofferson the title and theme of &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;, which became a hit for Kristofferson, Roger Miller, and Janis Joplin, and for which Foster received a co-writing credit.

===Recording Studios===
In 1964 Monument Records acquired the Sam Phillips Recording Service of Nashville, a recording studio in the top floor of the Cumberland Building, a former Masonic Lodge at 315 Seventh Avenue North in Nashville, which was renamed Fred Foster Sound Studios. Projects recorded at this studio include Roy Orbison&#x27;s 1964 hit &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;, Charlie Rich&#x27;s 1965 hit &quot;Mohair Sam&quot;, Ronnie Dove&#x27;s &quot;One Kiss For Old Times&#x27; Sake&quot;, and Sandy Posey 1966 hit &quot;Single Girl&quot;. In late 1967 the studio&#x27;s rental agreement was terminated when the Seventh Avenue building was sold (it would later be demolished) and Foster utilized Music City Records while securing a new location for his studio.

Foster found the ideal location for his company&#x27;s new recording studios and offices. The building, on 16th Avenue at the end of Music Row, was originally built in 1903 as a Presbyterian church. Completed in 1969, Monument Recording Studios featured a 33 x 39 foot recording space with 23 foot high ceilings, a 19 x 27 foot control room, acoustic echo chambers, business office, and recreation room. The studio was operated by Monument until 1975, when it was purchased by Tommy Strong and Mort Thomasson, who operated it as Studio One for the next two years, when producer Chip Young bought it and operated it as a Nashville location of his Young &#x27;Un Sound recording studio until 1989. The studios&#x27; history continued as Masterlink (1990-2010) and Southern Ground (2012-present).

===Later activities===
Foster sold the Monument label to Sony in the early 1980s. However, he remained active with his own Sunstone production company. He produced Willie Nelson&#x27;s 2006 Grammy Award–nominated &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me: The Songs of Cindy Walker&quot; and Nelson&#x27;s collaboration with Merle Haggard and Ray Price, &quot;Last of the Breed&quot; (2007). The latter was the winner of the 2008 Grammy for Best Country Collaboration, for the track &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. Foster’s final production was Dawn Landes’s &quot;Meet Me at the River (2018).&quot; 

==Personal life and death==
Foster was born in Rutherford County, North Carolina. His father was Vance Hampton Foster, and his mother was Clara Marcella (Weaste) Foster. He had three brothers and four sisters. After his father&#x27;s death in 1947, Foster struggled for two years to run the family&#x27;s farm and support his mother. He married Carol Jean Wallace on December 17, 1955.They had one son, Vance, and two daughters, Micki and Leah. They divorced in 1972. He married Lisa Gale Lawalin in 1978. They had two daughters Brit, and Kristen and divorced in 1990. Foster died in Nashville in 2019, aged 87, after a short illness.

==Honors==
Foster was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum on October 12, 2009, and was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame on October 11, 2012.

On March 29, 2016, it was announced that Foster would become a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. He was inducted alongside fellow North Carolinians Randy Travis and Charlie Daniels on October 16, 2016.

<doc id="383947" wikidata="Q506736" url="?curid=383947" title="Fokker F27 Friendship">
<text>The Fokker F27 Friendship is a turboprop airliner developed and manufactured by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker. It is the most numerous post-war aircraft manufactured in the Netherlands; the F27 was also one of the most successful European airliners of its era.

The F27 was developed during the early 1950s with the intent of producing a capable successor to the earlier piston engine-powered airliners that had become commonplace on the market, such as the Douglas DC-3. A key innovation of the F27 was the adoption of the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engine, which produced substantially less vibration and noise which provided improved conditions for passengers; another major comfort feature was cabin pressurisation. Innovative manufacturing techniques were also employed in the aircraft&#x27;s construction.

On 24 November 1955, the F27 made its maiden flight; on 19 November 1958, the type was introduced to revenue service. Shortly after its introduction, the F27 was recognised as being a commercial success. Under a licensing arrangement reached between Fokker and the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Fairchild, the F27 was manufactured in the United States by the latter; Fairchild went on to independently develop a stretched version of the airliner, which was designated as the Fairchild FH-227. During the 1980s, Fokker developed a modernised successor to the F27, the Fokker 50, which eventually replaced it in production.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
In the aftermath of the Second World War, twin-engine all-metal monoplanes such as the successful Douglas DC-3 airliner dominated commuter aviation. Over 10,000 DC-3s had been manufactured during wartime, which led to the type being highly available and thus encouraging its adoption by hundreds of operators across the world.

By the early 1950s, various aircraft manufacturers had begun considering the post-war requirements of the civil aviation market and several commenced work upon projects aiming to produce designs for new aircraft which would be viewed as best meeting these requirements; Dutch firm Fokker was amongst the companies pursuing development of such an aircraft. By 1951, figures within Fokker were urging that design work be undertaken on a prospective 32-seat airliner intended as a direct replacement for the popular DC-3. Fokker sought the opinions of existing DC-3 operators on what performance increases and refinements they would expect of a new model of commuter aircraft. On the basis of this feedback, the design team chose to incorporate various new technologies into the tentative design.
Fokker evaluated several potential configurations for the airliner, including the use of Wright Cyclone radial engines, before finally settling upon a high-wing aircraft, which was furnished with a pair of Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines and a pressurised cabin which contained a total of 28 passengers. The Dart engine had already proven successful on the early models of the Vickers Viscount, while a high-mounted wing had been selected as it produced a higher lift coefficient than a lower counterpart, it also enabled easier ground loading due to a lower floor level and provided unfettered external views to passengers without any weight increase. In the aircraft&#x27;s construction, Fokker used an innovative metal-to-metal bonding technique, Redux, resulting in a longer fatigue life, improved aerodynamics, and a lighter structure; Fokker became the first such company after de Havilland to employ such means.

In 1953, the proposed airliner received the name &quot;Friendship&quot;. A total of four prototypes were produced, two of these being flyable aircraft that were used for the test flight programme and were paid for by the Netherlands Institute of Aircraft Development; the other two prototypes were for static and fatigue testing. On 24 November 1955, the first prototype, registered &quot;PH-NIV&quot;, performed its maiden flight. The second prototype and initial production machines were 0.9 m (3 ft) longer than the first prototype in order to address a revealed tendency for slightly tail-heavy handling as well as to provide additional space for four more passengers, raising the maximum number of passengers which could be carried to 32. These aircraft were also powered by the Dart Mk 528 engine, which was capable of generating greater thrust.

===Further development===
Throughout the F27&#x27;s production life, Fokker proceeded to adapt the design for various purposes and roles. Via modifications such as the adoption of improved engines, rearranged loading doors, elongated fuselages, and other changes, several different models of the F27 were developed and made available for commercial operators. Several military transport models were also produced. Fokker also chose to design a dedicated model of the F27 for conducting maritime reconnaissance missions.

During 1952, Fokker established a relationship with the US aircraft manufacturer Fairchild, which was interested in the upcoming F27. In 1956, Fokker signed a licensing deal with Fairchild, under which the latter was authorised to manufacture the F27 in the USA. On 12 April 1958, the first American-built aircraft conducted its first flight. Production of Fairchild built aircraft would continue until July 1973. Fairchild proceeded to independently develop a stretched version of the airliner, designated as the FH-227. The majority of sales completed by Fairchild fell within the North American market.

In the early 1980s, Fokker decided to develop a modernised successor to the F27 Friendship, designated as the F27 Mark 050 and marketed as the Fokker 50. Although originating from the F27-500 airframe, the Fokker 50 was virtually a new aircraft, complete with Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada engines and modern systems, which led to its general performance and passenger comfort being noticeably improved over the F27. The Fokker 50 ultimately replaced the F27 in production.

==Operational history==

In November 1958, the first production aircraft, an F27-100 model, was delivered to Irish airline Aer Lingus; it performed its first revenue flight in the following month. Other early customers of the Friendship included Braathens SAFE and Luxair in Europe; New Zealand National Airways Corporation; Trans Australia Airlines and its Australian competitors Ansett and East-West Airlines; and Turkish Airlines.

Initial sales for the type were slow, which led to Fokker seeking financial support from banks and from the Dutch government in order to maintain production of the airliner while more customers were sought. In 1960, demand for the F27 increased rapidly as multiple airlines placed sizable orders for the type. This is in part due to the spreading reputation of the type, having been found by operators that, in comparison to its piston-engine wartime counterparts like the DC-3, the F27 possessed superior levels of efficiency, enabling faster flight times, greater passenger comfort and a higher level of reliability.

In 1960, the base purchase price for an RDa.6-powered F27 was £239,000. By the end of the production run for the Fokker F27 in 1987, a total of 592 units had been completed by Fokker (additionally, another 207 F-27s and FH-227s had been produced in the US by Fairchild), more than any other western European civil turboprop airliner at the time.

In later service, many aircraft have been modified from their original configurations for passenger service to perform cargo or express-package freighter duties instead. The last major cargo user of the F27 in the United States was FedEx Express, using it as a cargo &quot;feeder&quot; aircraft. These were retired and replaced by a mixture of ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft by the end of 2009, the last of these aircraft were subsequently donated to the Hickory Aviation Museum.

As of July 2010 a total of 65 F27s were in commercial service with almost 30 different airlines. By July 2013, only 25 Friendships remained in service, operated by 13 different airlines; most of these were F27-500s, with two -400s and a solitary -600 series aircraft in service. Italian cargo airline MiniLiner operated six F27s and Air Panama had four in its fleet. The United States Army Parachute Team has operated a single C-31A Troopship for conducting its skydiving exhibitions since 1985. As of July 2018, 10 aircraft remain in service operated by 7 airlines.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 10 June 1960, Trans Australia Airlines Flight 538 crashed in the sea near Mackay, Queensland, Australia, with 29 fatalities, in what is still the deadliest civilian Australian aircraft accident in history. The investigation was not able to determine a probable cause of this accident, but it was critical in the development of the flight recorder to record parameters to aid investigations of future airliner accidents.
* On 7 May 1964, Pacific Air Lines Flight 773 operated with a Fairchild F-27 crashed into a hill in San Ramon, California, after a suicidal passenger killed both pilots and then turned the gun on himself. All 41 remaining people on board also were killed.
* On the evening of 15 November 1964, Bonanza Air Lines Flight 114 operated with a Fairchild F-27 was flying from Phoenix, Arizona, to McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada, in poor weather conditions, when it crashed into the top of a hill in open desert country about 10 miles (16 km) SSW of Las Vegas. All 29 people on board—26 passengers and a crew of three—died instantly when the plane exploded on impact, no more than 10 feet (3 m) below a ridge crest. It was Bonanza&#x27;s only crash with fatalities during the airline&#x27;s 23-year history.
* On February 28, 1967, Philippine Airlines Flight 345, an F-27 100, crashed on approach to Mactan–Cebu International Airport. The aircraft pitched upwards before banking and descending, with its left wing striking trees and then the ground, ending with the fuselage nosing over and sliding on its back, catching fire. 12 of the 19 occupants were killed. A contributing factor to the crash was the improper load distribution affecting the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity.
*On 21 April 1969, an Indian Airlines flight crashed in a thunderstorm while crossing East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) airspace on its flight from Agartala to Calcutta, killing all 44 people on board.

* On 10 September 1992, Expreso Aéreo Flight 015, an F27-500 (reg. OB-1443), crashed in the airstrip of the remote Amazon town of Bellavista in Peru. Due to a pilot error on approximation, possibly compounded by fatigue and the co-pilot&#x27;s lack of experience, the plane hit the ground shortly before the runway threshold (practically crash-landing) and broke up in several parts, killing the pilot in the ensuing fire. The six remaining crew members and the 36 passengers managed to evacuate and survived, although some were injured.
* On 1 July 1995, an East West Airlines Fokker F27, registered VT-EWE, was engaged in a touch-and-go landing training exercise at Vadodara Airport when the aircraft&#x27;s left main landing gear failed on touchdown.

<text>Luther Leonidas Terry (September 15, 1911March 29, 1985) was an American physician and public health official. He was appointed the ninth Surgeon General of the United States from 1961 to 1965, and is best known for his warnings against the dangers and the impact of tobacco use on health.

==Early years==
Luther Terry was born in Red Level, Alabama to James Edward Terry, M.D., and Lula Mariah (Durham) Terry. His father was a graduate of the University of Alabama School of Medicine, and was the &quot;town doctor&quot; for Red Level. Many of Luther Terry&#x27;s earliest memories were of helping his father in the pharmacy and clinical offices in Red Level, and driving his father in the family&#x27;s Ford Model A to emergency appointments out in the county.

Luther Terry earned a B.S. degree at Birmingham-Southern College in 1931, where he was initiated into the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He then received an M.D. degree at Tulane University in 1935. After interning at the Hillman Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, and serving a residency in Cleveland Hospitals, Terry moved to Washington University in St. Louis in 1938 for an internship in pathology. The following year, he became an instructor at that institution. He subsequently served as instructor and assistant professor of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Texas at Galveston from 1940 to 1942.

==Career==
In 1942, Terry joined the staff of the Public Health Service Hospital in Baltimore, becoming Chief of Medical Services there the following year. His interest in cardiovascular research led him to accept the position of Chief of General Medicine and Experimental Therapeutics at the National Heart Institute in Bethesda in 1950, at first on a part-time basis while continuing his work at the Baltimore hospital. When the National Institutes of Health&#x27;s Clinical Center opened in 1953, Terry&#x27;s Heart Institute program was moved to the new facility and he devoted his full-time to the job. He also served as the first Chairman of the Medical Board of the Clinical Center (1953–1955) and was concurrently instructor and then assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine from 1944 to 1961. Terry and his team laid the foundations for what has been called &quot;the golden era of cardiovascular clinical investigation&quot;.

===Surgeon General===
In 1958, Terry became the Assistant Director of the National Heart Institute. He came to public prominence when President John F. Kennedy selected him as Surgeon General of the Public Health Service, effective March 2, 1961.

Although there had always been an awareness of the negative health effects of smoking, it was not until the 1950s that evidence began to be published suggesting that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer and other diseases. At the end of the decade, the Royal College of Physicians in the United Kingdom appointed a committee to investigate the relationship between smoking and health. The committee&#x27;s report, issued on March 7, 1962, clearly indicated cigarette smoking as a cause of lung cancer and bronchitis and argued that it probably contributed to cardiovascular disease as well.

Shortly after the release of this report, Terry established the Surgeon General&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health, which he chaired, to produce a similar report for the United States. &quot;Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service&quot;, released on January 11, 1964, concluded that lung cancer and chronic bronchitis are causally related to cigarette smoking. The report also noted out that there was suggestive evidence, if not definite proof, for a causative role of smoking in other illnesses such as emphysema, cardiovascular disease, and various types of cancer. The committee concluded that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial action.

In June 1964, the Federal Trade Commission voted by a margin of 3–1 to require that cigarette manufacturers &quot;clearly and prominently&quot; place a warning on packages of cigarettes effective January 1, 1965, stating that smoking was dangerous to health, in line with the warning issued by the Surgeon General&#x27;s special committee. The same warning would be required in all cigarette advertising effective July 1, 1965.

The landmark Surgeon General&#x27;s report on smoking and health stimulated a greatly increased concern about tobacco on the part of the American public and government policymakers and led to a broad-based anti-smoking campaign. It also motivated the tobacco industry to intensify its efforts to question the scientific evidence linking smoking and disease. The report was also responsible for the passage of the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965, which, among other things, mandated Surgeon General&#x27;s health warnings on cigarette packages.

Cigarette smoking of nicotine was defined as not an addiction in the Surgeon General&#x27;s first report on smoking (published by a committee of doctors who were largely smokers themselves).

==Later years==
Terry himself continued to play a leading role in the campaign against smoking after leaving the post of surgeon general, which he occupied through October 1, 1965. He chaired the National Interagency Council on Smoking and Health, a coalition of government agencies and nongovernment organizations, from 1967 to 1969, and served as a consultant to groups such as the American Cancer Society. He helped to obtain a ban on cigarette advertisements on radio and television in 1971. Late in his life he led the effort to eliminate smoking from the workplace.

When Terry retired from government service in 1965, he became vice president for medical affairs, as well as professor of medicine and community medicine, at the University of Pennsylvania. Terry was responsible for managing the university&#x27;s health sciences schools, comprising some 40 percent of the university&#x27;s budget, until he gave up the position of vice president in 1971. He retained his professorial appointment until 1975, when he became adjunct professor, and then in 1981 emeritus professor. From 1970 to 1983, he also served as president of University Associates, a nonprofit consulting firm based in Washington, D.C.

Terry&#x27;s last years were spent as corporate vice president for medical affairs for ARA Services of Philadelphia (1980–1983) and then as a consultant. He died at Pennsylvania Hospital on March 29, 1985, aged 73, after a heart attack.

A collection of his papers are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.

<doc id="383950" wikidata="Q5442772" url="?curid=383950" title="Female submission">
<text>Female submission or femsub is an activity or relationship in which a woman submits to the direction of a sexual partner or has her body used sexually by or for the sexual pleasure of her partner. The expression is often associated with BDSM, where submission to such activity is usually voluntarily and consensual. Submission usually involves a degree of trust by the woman in her partner. The dominant partner is usually a man, but can also be another woman, or there can be multiple dominant partners simultaneously. The submissive woman may derive sexual pleasure or emotional gratification from relinquishing (to varying degrees) control to (as well as satisfying) a trusted dominant partner.

A 1985 study suggested that about 30% of participants in BDSM activities were females. A 2015 study indicates that 61.7% of females who are active in BDSM expressed a preference for a submissive role, 25.7% consider themselves a switch, while 12.6% prefer the dominant role but a more recent survey from 2017 indicates that women tend to self-identify as Submissive, Slave, Bottom, or Masochist (SSBM) and always perform submissive roles while men tend to self-identify as Dominant, Master, Top, or Sadist (DMTS) and always perform dominant roles.

==Eroticism==


Submission can take the form of passivity or obedience in relation to any aspect of conduct and behavior. Submission can be to a partner in an interpersonal relationship, such as allowing the sex partner to initiate all sexual activity as well as setting the time and place and sex position. It can also be in relation to the type of sexual activity that the partners will engage in, including non-coital sex such as anal sex, or BDSM or sexual roleplay.

Some sex acts require a woman to be passive while an active sex partner performs sex acts on her, and this may be seen as a form of submission. Obedience may be a part of a sexual roleplay or activity, and can also be in the relation to the style of dress, if any, or behavior or any other manner. In fact, any act that is performed on a passive woman, such as undressing her, may be regarded as submissive behavior on the part of the woman.

Submission may be manifested in a multitude of ways whereby a woman relinquishes sexual or personal control to another, such as acts of servitude, submission to humiliation or punishments such as erotic spanking, hair pulling, caning and whipping, forced orgasms and female ejaculations, orgasm denial, golden showers, pussy torture, &quot;forced&quot; chastity, wax play, spitting, or other activities, at times in association with bondage.

Female submission can take the form of engaging in sexual activity with a person other than her normal partner, as in the case of swinging (sometimes called wife swapping), non-monogamy or prostitution. Female submission can also take place in the form of clothed male, naked female. The level and type of submission can vary from person to person, and from one time to another. Some women choose to include occasional sexual submission in an otherwise conventional sex life. For example, a woman may adopt a submissive role during a sexual activity to overcome a sexual inhibition she may have. A woman may choose to submit full-time, becoming a lifestyle slave.

Many people derive erotic pleasure from the submissiveness of a female partner, which they may regard as a turn-on; and some people regard obvious passivity as a form of feminine flirting or seduction. Some women submit to the sexual wishes of their partner for the pleasure of the partner, which may itself result in sexual pleasure for the submissive woman. In other cases the submission is solely for the pleasure of the partner where the woman does not receive pleasure as such from the activity.

==In literature==
Female submission is common in traditional literature. &quot;Story of O&quot;, published in 1954 in French, is an erotic tale of female submission involving a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer named O, who is taught to be constantly available for all forms of sex, offering herself to any male.

Wonder Woman&#x27;s origin is closely tied to the world of BDSM and feminism. Its creator William Moulton Marston, an ardent feminist and practicing psychologist did not view female submission as an act of weakness or defeat. He used to see it as an act of love and respect.

<doc id="383952" wikidata="Q132140" url="?curid=383952" title="Federal University of Minas Gerais">
<text>The Federal University of Minas Gerais (, UFMG) is a federal research university located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Its main and biggest campus is located in the city of Belo Horizonte. It is one of Brazil&#x27;s five largest and highest-ranked universities. 

UFMG offers 79 undergraduate education programs—including bachelor&#x27;s degrees, licenciate degrees, or professional degree titles—as well as 90 postgraduate education programs, awarding 30 postbaccalaureate specialization degrees, 92 master&#x27;s degrees, and 72 doctoral degrees; the school&#x27;s hospital facilities also have 41 medical residency programs. UFMG also has &quot;campi&quot; at Tiradentes and Montes Claros, though most courses are taught at the main campus in the Pampulha district of Belo Horizonte.

UFMG receives one of the highest amounts of federal funds and resources among all federal universities in Brazil. According to the 2021 Times Higher Education ranking, it is the third best university in Brazil and the fifth best in Latin America. Based on results of the &quot;Student&#x27;s National Performance Exam&quot; (ENADE), UFMG&#x27;s undergraduate degrees are among the best in Brazil, while national ranking systems usually place UFMG as one of the best in the country.

==History==
The origins of the university go back to the 19th century, when it first appeared in the Republic as a continuation of a process that began during the Empire, with the opening of the first institutions of higher education.

In 1898, the Ouro Preto Faculty of Law was transferred to Belo Horizonte, which at the time was set to be the new state capital.

A few new unconnected faculties would be founded later: in 1907, the Free School of Dentistry; in 1911, the Faculty of Medicine, the School of Engineering, and a course in pharmacy attached to the Free School of Dentistry.

In 1927, these four schools merged to found University of Minas Gerais (UMG), a private institution subsidized by the state government. This is the mark of the foundation of the university.

The UMG remained funded by Minas Gerais government until 1949, when funding had been delegated to the Brazilian Government, though, the name UFMG (including &quot;Federal&quot;) was not adopted until 1965.

In the 1940s, a large area in the Pampulha region became the site for the construction of University City. The first structures erected were the Institute of Mechanics (now the Vocational School) and the Main Building. The effective occupation of the campus by the university community started only in the 1960s, when the construction of the buildings that today house most of the academic units was started.

At the time of federalization, the schools of architecture, philosophy and economics were already integrated in the university. As its expansion carried on, the school of nursing (1950), veterinary science (1961), information science (1962), music (1962) and physical education (1969) were founded.

In 1968, a university reform altered profoundly the structure of UFMG. The College of Philosophy spawned multiple institutions: the College of Philosophy and Human Sciences, the Institute of Biological Sciences, the Institute of Exact Sciences, the Institute of Geosciences and the Colleges of Literature and Education.

Additional courses have been established, among them agronomy, archival science, theater, museology, control engineering, computational mathematics, and speech therapy/audiology.

==Population==
The UFMG has a population of roughly 72 thousand people among 34,482 undergraduate students, 2,247 postbaccalaureate specialization students, 10,556 master&#x27;s and doctoral students, 3,202 professors, and 4,246 administrative employees. It is research-oriented, even at the undergraduate level, whose students are encouraged to take part in research development through the Scientific Initiation program. Out of the number of professors, 761 (24%) are CNPq award-recipients due to outstanding research productivity. It encompasses 860 research groups, 1051 patent deposits in Brazil and abroad, and has the highest score (5 out of 5) at the Ministry of Education&#x27;s undergraduate assessment.

==Admissions==
The undergraduate students are admitted through the national annual exams called Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio (National High School Exam). Competition to get into undergraduate programs involved 111,718 candidates to 6740 vacancy openings (16.6 candidates per vacancy; 6% of candidates get a position).

==Location==

The UFMG main campus is located at the Pampulha region of the city of Belo Horizonte. The total area of this land-campus equals 8,769,690 square meters, with a built area reaching 639,777 square meters. Aside from the main campus in Pampulha, in the same city there are the UFMG Health Sciences campus at Alfredo Balena Avenue in the city&#x27;s hospitals district (or Santa Efigênia district), the UFMG School of Architecture and Design campus located at the Savassi district, and the Faculty of Law campus at the city center (in Belo Horizonte there are also ecological parks and cultural facilities such as a Conservatoire and 20 museums that belong to, and are administered by, the university).

Outside of Belo Horizonte, UFMG has the Agronomic Sciences Campus in the city of Montes Claros, and a cultural campus in the city of Tiradentes (both in the state of Minas Gerais). The UFMG has also several other facilities such as Casa da Glória in Diamantina. Within the Pampulha Campus there is the CDTN, a Federal Institute for Nuclear Sciences Research. The campus avails of 38 built facilities, hundreds of scientific research laboratories and a 250 kW TRIGA nuclear reactor from General Atomics. There is also an extensive area of secondary forest known as the &quot;Estação Ecológica&quot; (&quot;Ecological Station&quot;), where some university scientists – mainly ecologists and zoologists – carry out research; this is the largest green space within the city boundaries, and is home to endemic insect species. 
== Academic Units ==

The faculty members (professors and lecturers) of the Federal University of Minas Gerais are hosted by departments. The departments are administered by one of three types of collegiate units: Schools, Faculties, and Institutes. Administratively, Schools, Faculties, and Institutes enjoy an equivalent executive status as Academic Units under the university, so they provide no practical difference among each other in administrative terms. They are the main Colleges of the university.

=== Schools ===

It is the unit responsible for the teaching of basic education, i.e. education prior to higher education. The UFMG has a kindergarten school, a primary elementary school, a middle school, and several high school courses, either academic or professional. Usually, the teachers of these levels of education at these UFMG schools are students of the UFMG Faculty of Education pursuing their practices, but these facilities also have permanent faculty members who are actually administered by the same regulations as any other lecturer of professor. This academic unit, the School of Professional and Basic Education, is responsible for the administration of these teaching activities and the permanent members are hired by this school.

==== School of Engineering ====

<doc id="383953" wikidata="Q2320615" url="?curid=383953" title="Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)">
<text>Durham Cathedral Library, Manuscript A.II.10. is a fragmentary seventh-century Insular Gospel Book, produced in Lindisfarne c. 650. Only seven leaves of the book survive, bound in three separate volumes in the Durham Cathedral Dean and Chapter Library (MS A. II 10 ff. 2–5, 238-8a; MS C. III. 13, ff. 192–5; and MS C. III. 20, ff 1–2). Although this book is fragmentary, it is the earliest surviving example in the series of lavish Insular Gospel Books which includes the Book of Durrow, the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Lichfield Gospels and the Book of Kells.

The surviving illuminations are a border to the colophon at the end of the Gospel of Matthew and an &quot;INI&quot; monogram at the beginning of the Gospel of Mark.

The frame is in the form of three &quot;D&quot; shapes stacked one atop another and which occupy the entire right half of the page. The spaces between the curves of the &quot;D&quot; shapes are filled with triangular knots. The &quot;D&quot; shapes themselves are decorated orange dots superposed on yellow interlace patterns. The pattern of the interlace is different on each of the &quot;D&quot; shapes. This frame represents the first appearance in an Insular manuscript of interlace, a motif which will assume enormous importance in later manuscripts. The frame encloses the &quot;explicit&quot; for Matthew, the &quot;incipit&quot; for Mark, and the text of the &quot;pater noster&quot; in Greek, but written in Latin letters.

The &quot;INI&quot; monogram is formed by compressing the three letters into a large N which is reminiscent of the initial N found in the Ambrosiana Jerome. The left upright of the monogram is over twice as long as the right. Both uprights are divided into two columns of coloured panels separated by a black and cable. The panels are decorated with dots of contrasting colours. Both ends of the right upright and the top end of the left upright have spiral pattern terminals. The lower end of the left upright and both ends of the knotted cross bar have beast-head terminals. In the first line of text that follows the monogram, the letters are hollow-shafted and each successive letter is smaller than the previous. There are some smaller initials marking verses in Matthew.

This manuscript shows the beginning of many techniques and motifs that are used in later manuscripts. The use of decorated text in which the decoration distorts the shape of the letters has been seen before, notably in the Cathach of St. Columba. But the combination of letters into a monogram is a new motif, one that will be developed extensively in later manuscripts. Similar &quot;INI&quot; monograms will be used at the beginning of the Gospel of Mark in almost every later Insular Gospel Book. The use of alternating colours that almost resemble enamel plaques such as are seen in this manuscript&#x27;s INI monogram will also become a standard technique in later manuscripts. The successive diminution of letters following an initial had also been seen, again notably in the Cathach, and would also be a standard technique in Insular illumination. Finally the interlace pattern first found here would become an almost defining aspect of Insular illumination.

<text>The 1997 Irish general election to the 28th Dáil was held on Friday, 6 June, following the dissolution of the 27th Dáil on 15 May by President Mary Robinson, on the request of Taoiseach John Bruton. The general election took place in 41 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 166 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas, under a revision in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1995.

The two largest parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, increased both their vote totals and representation, while both the junior parties in the Dáil, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats, had disastrous campaigns that saw their representation in the Dáil slashed by 50% or greater. However, some of the other minor parties in the Dáil saw improvements: for the first time in 75 years a Sinn Féin TD took their seat in the Dáil after Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin was elected, while the Green Party added a second TD and the Socialist Party gained their first ever national representative in Joe Higgins.

Following the election, the 28th Dáil met at Leinster House on 26 June to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Bertie Ahern was appointed Taoiseach, forming the 25th government of Ireland, a minority coalition government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.

The election has been described by &quot;Irish Independent&quot; journalist Shane Coleman as a prelude to the &quot;golden years&quot; of the Celtic Tiger, and thus one of the most significant general elections in Irish history.

==Background==
The maximum amount of time between a general election in Ireland is five years, and thus the governing Rainbow Coalition of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left knew an election would have to be called in mid to late 1997. Fine Gael had wanted to wait until the autumn to call the election, but Labour were keen to fight their campaign in the summer. Anticipating the election, on 14 April 1997 during their annual party conference, Labour leader Dick Spring declared &quot;I will not, in the aftermath of the next general election, come before you and recommend any form of coalition with either of the parties that make up the centre-right alternative, the Progressive Democrats or Fianna Fail&quot;, which ruled out the possibility of Labour being able to play kingmaker between possible coalition blocs.

Both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were delighted by the decision to hold the election in the summer instead of the autumn; Fianna Fáil in particular feared the release in October or November of the report by the McCracken Tribunal, which was investing allegations that Ben Dunne Jnr. had bribed members of Fianna Fáil and that they had aided him in tax evasion.

The 1997 general election saw the public offered a choice of two possible coalitions. The existing government was a coalition of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left – called the Rainbow Coalition, while the opposition &quot;alternative coalition&quot; consisted of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.

==Campaigns==
===Rainbow coalition (Fine Gael, Labour, Democratic Left)===
The outgoing Rainbow parties campaigned to re-elect the coalition and thus emphasized the working relationship that they had developed, running with the slogan &#x27;Partnership That Works&#x27;. They claimed credit for a booming economy, improving social services and reforms such as the introduction of divorce. Despite this united front, each party fought its own campaign. Labour emphasised the number of campaign pledges it had managed to implement not only as part of the Rainbow government but also during its coalition with Fianna Fáil.

===Fianna Fáil campaign===
Fianna Fáil under Bertie Ahern had been restructuring itself after its turbulent period under Charles Haughey and Albert Reynolds. The party&#x27;s central office gained control of candidate selection and modernised its campaigning strategy, especially concerning vote management and controlling transfers under Ireland&#x27;s PR electoral system. In addition, the bitter internal feuding that had dogged the party for decades was ended by Ahern&#x27;s more unifying style of leadership. This leadership also allowed Fianna Fáil to run a very energetic campaign that emphasised Ahern&#x27;s relative youth and enthusiasm, which distanced the party from scandals that had beset the party.

===Progressive Democrats&#x27; campaign===
Despite entering the election with polls suggesting they would overtake Labour as the third biggest party, and with Mary Harney as the most popular party leader, the Progressive Democrats struggled. Initially, the party ran a presidential-style campaign that emphasised Harney. However, entering a pact with a resurgent Fianna Fáil meant it struggled to assert itself. In response, the PDs hastily published a manifesto — a move that backfired as it controversially called for single parent benefits to be cut in order to encourage single mothers to live with their parents. This drew fire from Proinsias De Rossa, who claimed Harney did &quot;not have a bull&#x27;s notion about social welfare&quot;. The Progressive Democrats&#x27; manifesto also called for the laying off of 25,000 public sector workers over five years, a proposal that was heavily criticised by the left-wing parties. In response, Fianna Fáil&#x27;s leadership demanded a sit-down meeting with the Progressive Democrat leadership, and after the two parties publicly announced together that no layoffs would be made in the public sector without the consent of Irish trade unions. Harney also claimed her comments about unwed mothers had been misrepresented by the media.

===Party slogans/Manifestos===
==Campaign topics==
===Sinn Féin and Northern Ireland===
1997 was a pivotal year politically across the island of Ireland as the Troubles drew to an end and progress towards the forthcoming Good Friday Agreement was being made. Inevitably, the issue of Sinn Féin&#x27;s participation in the election and each party&#x27;s policy on Northern Ireland came up repeatedly during the campaign. Previous to the May 1997 United Kingdom general election, leader of Fine Gael John Bruton declared that if the IRA had not declared a ceasefire, then a vote for Sinn Féin would be a vote for violence. However, on 26 May, Labour leader and coalition partner Dick Spring stated that a vote for Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland would be a vote for peace. The opposition in the Dáil responded by declaring that the government was sending out mixed messaging about Sinn Féin and Northern Ireland.

In late May/early June, Bernie Ahern began attacking Bruton on the topic of Northern Ireland, criticising Bruton for not being the leading voice of &quot;Nationalist Ireland&quot; and promising that he would take this mantle if elected Taoiseach. Simultaneously, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams involved himself in the election by criticising Bruton&#x27;s handling of the peace process. On 31 May, an active Provisional IRA landmine was discovered in Belfast, prompting Bruton to state he would &quot;think very hard&quot; before allowing any further contact between members of the government and Sinn Féin. Afterwards, the leader of the Democratic Left, Proinsias De Rossa, asked Ahern to clarify his &quot;electoral support for Sinn Féin&quot;. Ahern denied he had ever lent support to Sinn Féin and went further by stating categorially he would rule Sinn Féin out of any possible coalition talks following the election. Ahern justified this by saying it would send the wrong message to Unionists in Northern Ireland to add Sinn Féin to a coalition.

===Crime===
The murder of journalist Veronica Guerin in June 1996 by drug lords in Dublin ensured that the subject of crime was a pressing one during the election. Although Fine Gael had traditionally been the &quot;party of law and order&quot; in Ireland, Fianna Fáil were able to seize on the subject of crime and declared they would have a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach to crime. Fianna Fáil Spokesperson on Crime, John O&#x27;Donoghue, was able to dictate the conversation and was also able, previous to the election, to convince the government to support his bill which gave greater powers to the Criminal Assets Bureau.

==Opinion polls==
==Results==

The outgoing Ceann Comhairle retired at this election. Independents include Independent Fianna Fáil (11,607 votes, 1 seat).

===Voting summary===
===Seats summary===
Fianna Fáil increased its representation, but the Progressive Democrats had a disastrous election, maintaining its share of the vote, but winning only four seats compared to ten at the previous election, losing seats thought safe such as Cork North-Central and Dún Laoghaire.

Although Fine Gael gained seats, it entered opposition due to seat losses of its government coalition colleagues. One of the main features of the election, was the collapse of the Labour Party vote. Not only did it lose seats it had picked up in the 1992 general election, when its vote was at an all-time high – such as in Clare and Laois–Offaly – but it also lost reasonably safe seats, such as in Dublin North, Dublin Central and Cork South-Central. Dick Spring would retire as leader of the Labour Party later that year, after further disappointment in the presidential election. Democratic Left also suffered, losing its two gains made in by-elections during the 27th Dáil.

The Green Party won a second seat, with John Gormley elected in Dublin South-East. He was elected by just over 30 votes after a recount lasting four days saw Progressive Democrat Michael McDowell defeated. The loss of McDowell was particularly stinging to the Progressive Democrats as McDowell was their &quot;chief ideologue&quot;.

Sinn Féin won its first Dáil seat since 1957, with the party winning a seat in Cavan–Monaghan with the election of Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin. It also narrowly missed a seat in Kerry North. When Ó Caoláin took his seat in the Dáil, it was the first time since 1922 that a member of Sinn Féin had done so, having abandoned its policy of abstention with regard to the Dáil in 1986. Ó Caoláin&#x27;s entry into the Dáil marked a major turning point in the history of Sinn Féin, which would continue thereafter to hold a presence in the Dáil.

The Socialist Party, a Trotskyist party which consisted of former members of the Labour Party expelled in 1989, won its first seat in Dublin West.

==Government formation==
Following the election, none of the major parties had a clear majority. Negotiations resulted in a Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition taking office. Four Independent Teachta Dála (TDs) also supported the government ensuring a working majority. Bertie Ahern became the Taoiseach while Mary Harney of the Progressive Democrats became Tánaiste.

==Dáil membership changes==
The following changes took place as a result of the election:
*17 outgoing TDs retired, including the Ceann Comhairle, Seán Treacy
*149 TDs stood for re-election
**121 were re-elected
**28 failed to be re-elected
*45 successor TDs were elected
**32 were elected for the first time
**13 had previously been TDs
*There were 6 successor female TDs, replacing 9 outgoing, decreasing the total number by 3 to 20
*There were changes in 34 of the 41 constituencies contested

Outgoing TDs are listed in the constituency they contested in the election. For some, such as Kildare North, this differs from the constituency they represented in the outgoing Dáil. Where more than one change took place in a constituency the concept of successor is an approximation for presentation only.

==Seanad election==
The Dáil election was followed by the election to the 21st Seanad.

<text>The sac spiders of the family Clubionidae are nocturnal, sac-building hunting spiders with a near-worldwide distribution. Their sacs, silken retreats in which they hide during the day, may be made in a variety of places, including between folded leaves or grass blades, under bark and below rocks or other ground litter.

Although formerly a much larger catch-all taxon, in its current definition the family contains less than 700 described species across 18 genera, of which &quot;Clubiona&quot; is by far most species-rich, with 528 accepted species . 

==Taxonomy==
The Clubionidae have a complex taxonomic history. Historically, the family was a large catch-all taxon for a variety of spiders that shared the following morphological and behavioral similarities: having eight eyes arranged in two rows; having conical anterior spinnerets that touched; and being nocturnal wandering predators that build &quot;sacs&quot; to retreat to during the day. 

A large number of genera have been transferred from Clubionidae to other families, and several former subfamilies of the Clubionidae are now treated as separate families. The Zoropsidae, to which genera &quot;Anachemmis&quot;, &quot;Lauricius&quot; and &quot;Liocranoides&quot; were transferred, is much more closely related to the lynx spiders of family Oxyopidae than to the remaining Clubionidae. 

According to 2023 cladistic research by Siddharth Kulkarni, Hannah M. Wood and Gustavo Hormiga, the remaining Clubionidae remain polyphyletic as a result of the current placement of genus &quot;Elaver&quot;.

, the Clubionidae consist of over 665 species in 18 genera worldwide, with by far the majority of species in genus &quot;Clubiona&quot;. The following genera are accepted by the World Spider Catalog:

*&quot;Arabellata&quot; — New Guinea
*&quot;Bucliona&quot; — St. Helena, Kenya, Russian Far East, Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan
*&quot;Clubiona&quot; — Africa, North America, Asia, Oceania, South America, Europe, Panama

<text>Paradise Garage, also known as &quot;the Garage&quot; or the &quot;Gay-rage&quot;, was a New York City discotheque notable in the history of dance and pop music, as well as LGBT and nightclub cultures. The club was founded by sole proprietor Michael Brody, and occupied a building formerly located at 84 King Street in the SoHo neighborhood. It operated from 1977 to 1987 and featured resident DJ Larry Levan.

The Garage is credited with influencing the development of modern nightclubs, and is cited as a direct inspiration for London&#x27;s Ministry of Sound. Unlike other venues of its time, Paradise Garage promoted dancing rather than verbal interaction, and it was the first to place the DJ at the center of attention. It was known for its enthusiastic-yet-unforgiving nature toward performers. It hosted many notable musicians including Diana Ross and a young Madonna. In 1979, Tim Curry released the album &quot;Fearless&quot;, containing the single &quot;Paradise Garage&quot;, whose lyrics narrate visiting the discotheque.

== History ==

=== Physical space ===
Paradise Garage derived its name from the building&#x27;s origin as an early automobile parking structure. Its initial certificate of occupancy, dated March 26, 1925, identifies the architect of the two-story commercial building at 80-86 King Street as Victor Mayper.

Michael Brody&#x27;s imprint on the space began in 1977 with the club opening as 84 King Street Garage. After a year-long renovation, it officially became Paradise Garage on January 28, 1978. Among the improvements were a sprung dancefloor and custom sound system, developed by Richard Long of Richard Long &amp; Associates (RLA). The club&#x27;s main room layout and dancefloor were reportedly purpose-designed around the sound system, which is said to have been the best in New York City at that time and described by François Kevorkian as a &quot;temple of music.&quot;

The venue initially accommodated 750 patrons for the original dance floor which was later turned into the front lounge/gray room/glass lounge but a 1978 expansion when the main dance floor opened raised its legal capacity to 1,400 people. Brody then added a rooftop lounge in 1984 styled after the coastal shrubland and beachside villas of the nearby Fire Island Pines, where Brody owned a summer home.

After 11 years of operation, The Garage&#x27;s lease ended on October 1, 1987. The building later was adapted for use as truck depot by Verizon Communications. In April 2018, it was demolished and replaced by high-rise luxury condominiums.

=== Culture ===
The Garage was largely modeled on David Mancuso&#x27;s private invitation-only DJ parties at The Loft. Admission to the club was only available to members and their guests with an interview process used to select members. In order to avoid New York City restrictions on bar and restaurant hours-of-operation, snacks and beverages were freely available to patrons and no liquor was served. These measures allowed the club to stay open after hours, often until 10:00 AM or even later the following day.

In contrast to its well-known contemporary Studio 54, The Garage fostered a distinctly no-frills, egalitarian atmosphere, as reminisced by one of its former dancers:

The club hosted a number of charity events, benefiting organizations like Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis (GMHC) and U.S. Fund for UNICEF. As of 2008, the Paradise Garage trademark is owned by GMHC.

=== Music ===

Paradise Garage was an epicenter for early pioneers of dance music under the curation of resident DJ Larry Levan. The unique and eclectic styles of disco and dance music featured at the Garage gave rise to descriptive encompassing terms like New York house, &quot;garage&quot;, &quot;garage style&quot;, and &quot;garage classic&quot; (to describe a record that was made famous at, or associated with, the club).

Although the term &quot;garage music&quot; (not to be confused with UK garage) does not exclusively mean house music, the latter saw extensive development and promotion among Levan and his contemporaries, Frankie Knuckles and Nicky Siano. Nonetheless, these DJ&#x27;s played all kinds of music at Paradise Garage so long as it was danceable; for example, The Clash and The Police, as well as traditional &quot;disco&quot; artists like Gwen Guthrie and Sylvester.

Among those who benefited from what became known as &quot;The Garage Sound&quot; or &quot;Garage Music&quot; was Mel Cheren, a partial-backer of the club and owner of New York label West End Records. West End&#x27;s successes included such hits as &quot;Sessomatto&quot; by Sessa Matto, &quot;Hot Shot&quot; by Karen Young, &quot;Heartbeat&quot; by Taana Gardner (remixed by Levan), &quot;Do It to the Music&quot; by Raw Silk, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Wait&quot; by the Peech Boys (produced by Levan). West End Records folded for a number of years, then re-opened in the late 1990s and released one of Levan&#x27;s DJ sets recorded live at the Garage.

==== Paradise Garage Top 100 ====
In the 2000 book &quot;Last Night A DJ Saved My Life&quot; by Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton, a chart was detailed that listed the &quot;Top 100&quot; of the Paradise Garage, selected by &quot;The Committee&quot;. It is unclear whether this list represents the hundred most played songs at the club or the hundred fan-favorite/DJ favorite tracks.
== Performers ==
Notable performers who have played at Paradise Garage include:
==In popular culture==
===Tribute events===
*On May 11, 2014, in an event organized by Red Bull Music Academy, former Paradise Garage DJ David DePino, his fellow Paradise Garage alum Joey Llanos, and the dance music DJ François Kevorkian paid tribute to both the Paradise Garage and the late Larry Levan with a block party located on the street outside the club&#x27;s former entrance. The event was coordinated with an effort to rename the King Street block Larry Levan Way and featured songs considered Garage classics, some DJ&#x27;d, some of which were sung live by Jocelyn Brown, who appeared onstage to deliver such favorites as &quot;I&#x27;m Caught Up (In a One Night Love Affair)&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;.
*From May 24 to September 22, 2019, the New York Historical Society&#x27;s Stonewall 50 Exhibition displayed the original Paradise Garage metal sign from the disco&#x27;s original building, which was a parking garage. Credits also on display read: &quot;Paradise Garage (1976-1987) Dennis Wunderlin (b. 1943), designer. Exterior sign, ca. 1977. Metal, paint. Fales Library and Special Collections, New York University, New York, NY&quot;.

===Tribute sites===
Multiple tribute sites are dedicated to the Paradise Garage, such as paradisegargenyc.com and TheParadiseGarage.net.

===Tribute movies===
In 2019, the DJ Corrado Rizza directed and produced a documentary movie called &quot;Larry&#x27;s Garage&quot;.

The significance of the Paradise Garage to the history of disco music is discussed in Episode 3 of the 2024 PBS series &quot;Disco: Soundtrack of a Revolution&quot;.

<text>Beverly Holcombe Robertson (June 5, 1827 – December 12, 1910) was a cavalry officer in the United States Army on the Western frontier and a Confederate States Army general during the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Robertson was born on a plantation in Amelia County, Virginia. He received an appointment to the United States Military Academy, becoming a cadet in 1845 and graduated in 1849 as 25th out of 43. Assigned to the 2nd U.S. Dragoons as a second lieutenant, he attended the cavalry school at Carlisle Barracks. He then served on the frontier at various outposts in New Mexico Territory, Kansas Territory, and Nebraska Territory, fighting at various times with the Apache and Sioux. At one point Robertson courted Flora Cooke, the daughter of his regimental commander Philip St. George Cooke, but she eventually became the wife of J.E.B. Stuart. In 1855 he married Virginia Neville Johnston, a cousin to Joseph E. Johnston. In the same year Robertson was promoted to first lieutenant. In 1860 he became adjutant of the regiment while serving in Utah Territory, and soon was elevated to acting assistant adjutant general for the Department of Utah. He was promoted to captain in March 1861. However he was report to have pro-Confederate sentiments and when Virginia seceded he decided to follow his home state he tendered his resignation but instead was dismissed from the United States Army.

==Civil War==
In August 1861, after arriving in the east, he was appointed as Colonel and helped to organize the 4th Virginia Cavalry Regiment but failed to be reelected as regimental Colonel in early 1862. Nonetheless he was promoted to brigadier general on June 9, 1862. He led a brigade of Virginia cavalry in the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862, and the early part of the Maryland Campaign in September 1862. Prior to the Battle of Antietam, having a very mixed relation with his superiors, he was relieved of his command and ordered to North Carolina to recruit and train new cavalry regiments. Down there he commanded the Confederate forces at the Battle of White Hall.

After training and sending north several cavalry units, during the Gettysburg Campaign Robertson was back with the Army of Northern Virginia. He again commanded a brigade of cavalry, having brought with him the 4th and 5th North Carolina cavalry regiments, under Stuart. At the Battle of Brandy Station his men failed to significantly delay a Union column approaching Brandy Station from the southeast. He fought in Stuart&#x27;s delaying actions in the Loudoun Valley at Middleburg and Upperville. Due to seniority, for parts of the campaign Robertson directed both his and &quot;Grumble&quot; Jones&#x27;s brigades. Robertson helped cover Lee&#x27;s retreat following the Battle of Gettysburg, the brigade having suffered heavy losses during the campaign.

He was assigned in October 1863 to command the Second Subdistrict of the Military District of South Carolina. He helped defend Charleston from enemy attack. Robertson served in the Carolinas Campaign and surrendered with Gen. Johnston.

==Postbellum career==
After the war, Robertson moved to Washington, D.C., and worked in the insurance business for several decades. He is buried in Robertson Cemetery near Scott&#x27;s Fork, Amelia County, Virginia.

<text>Eben Moglen (born July 13, 1959) is an American legal scholar who is professor of law and legal history at Columbia University, and is the founder, Director-Counsel and Chairman of Software Freedom Law Center.

==Biography==
Moglen started out as a computer programming language designer and then received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Swarthmore College in 1980. In 1985, he received a Master of Philosophy in history and a JD from Yale University. He has held visiting appointments at Harvard University, Tel Aviv University and the University of Virginia since 1987.

He was a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall (1986–87 term). He joined the faculty of Columbia Law School in 1987, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1988. He received a Ph.D. in history from Yale University in 1993. Moglen serves as a director of the Public Patent Foundation.

Moglen was part of Philip Zimmermann&#x27;s defense team, when Zimmermann was being investigated over the export of Pretty Good Privacy, a public key encryption system, under US export laws.

In 2003 he received the EFF Pioneer Award. In February 2005, he founded the Software Freedom Law Center.

Moglen was closely involved with the Free Software Foundation, serving as general counsel from 1994 to 2016 and board member from 2000 to 2007. As counsel, Moglen was tasked with enforcing the GNU General Public License (GPL) on behalf of the FSF, and later became heavily involved with drafting version 3 of the GPL. On April 23, 2007 he announced in a blog post that he would be stepping down from the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation. Moglen stated that after the GPLv3 Discussion Draft 3 had been released, he wanted to devote more time to writing, teaching, and the Software Freedom Law Center.

In February 2011, Moglen created the Freedom Box Foundation to design software for a very small server called the FreedomBox. The FreedomBox aims to be an affordable personal server which runs only free software, with a focus on anonymous and secure communication. FreedomBox launched version 0.1 in 2012.

== Legal issues ==

In October 2023 the Free Software Foundation Europe and Software Freedom Conservancy announced their intention to end their cooperation with the Software Freedom Law Center and with Moglen following allegations of abusive behaviour towards employees and community members.

The same day, Bradley M. Kuhn publicly accused Moglen of being an abusive employer and of hostility toward the LGBTQIA+ community, stating that the Software Freedom Law Center is no longer a safe space and that he&#x27;s often worried about Moglen&#x27;s students.

Such behaviours have also been asserted since 2017 by Matthew Garrett.

==Views==

=== Free software ===

Moglen says that free software is a fundamental requirement for a democratic and free society in which we are surrounded by and dependent upon technical devices. Only if controlling these devices is open to all via free software, can we balance power equally.

Moglen believes the idea of proprietary software is as ludicrous as having &quot;proprietary mathematics&quot; or &quot;proprietary geometry&quot;. This would convert the subjects from &quot;something you can learn&quot; into &quot;something you must buy&quot;, he has argued. He points out that software is among the &quot;things which can be copied infinitely over and over again, without any further costs&quot;.

&quot;Moglen&#x27;s Metaphorical Corollary to Faraday&#x27;s Law&quot; is the idea that the information appearance and flow between the human minds connected via the Internet works like electromagnetic induction. Hence Moglen&#x27;s phrase &quot;Resist the resistance!&quot; (i.e. remove anything that inhibits the flow of information).

=== Other ===
Moglen has criticized what he calls the &quot;reification of selfishness&quot;. He has said, &quot;A world full of computers which you can&#x27;t understand, can&#x27;t fix and can&#x27;t use (because it is controlled by inaccessible proprietary software) is a world controlled by machines.&quot;

He has called on lawyers to help the Free Software movement, saying: &quot;Those who want to share their code can make products and share their work without additional legal risks.&quot; He urged his legal colleagues, &quot;It&#x27;s worth giving up a little in order to produce a sounder ecology for all. Think kindly about the idea of sharing.&quot;

Moglen has criticized trends which result in &quot;excluding people from knowledge&quot;. On the issue of free software versus proprietary software, he has argued that &quot;much has been said by the few who stand to lose&quot;. Moglen calls for a &quot;sensible respect for both the creators and users&quot; of software code. In general, this concept is a part of what Moglen has termed a &quot;revolution&quot; against the privileged owners of media, distribution channels, and software. On March 13, 2009, in a speech given at Seattle University, Moglen said of the free software movement that, When everybody owns the press, then freedom of the press belongs to everybody&#x27; seems to be the inevitable inference, and that&#x27;s where we are moving, and when the publishers get used to that, they&#x27;ll become us, and we&#x27;ll become them, and the first amendment will mean: &#x27;Congress shall make no law ... abridging freedom of speech, or of the press ...&#x27;, &quot;not&quot; – as they have tended to argue in the course of the 20th century – &#x27;Congress shall make no law infringing the sacred right of the Sulzbergers to be different&#x27;.&quot;

On the subject of digital rights management, Moglen said in 2006, &quot;We also live in a world in which the right to tinker is under some very substantial threat. This is said to be because movie and record companies must eat. I will concede that they must eat. Though, like me, they should eat less.&quot;

<text>ABN AMRO Bank N.V. is the third-largest Dutch bank, with headquarters in Amsterdam. It was initially formed in 1991 by merger of the two prior Dutch banks that form its name, Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN) and Amsterdamsche en Rotterdamsche Bank (AMRO Bank).

Following aggressive international expansion, ABN AMRO was acquired and broken up in 2007–2008 by a consortium of European banks, including Fortis which intended to take over its formed operations in the Benelux region. Fortis came under stress in the autumn of 2008, and was in turn broken up into separate national entities; the Dutch operations, namely Fortis Bank Nederland and the former ABN AMRO activities that Fortis had planned to absorb, were nationalized, restructured, and renamed ABN AMRO in mid-2010. On 20 November 2015, the Dutch government publicly re-listed the company through an IPO and sold 20 percent of the shares to the public.

ABN AMRO has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

==History==

===Background===
In 1824, King William I established the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (NHM) a trading company to revive trade and financing of the Dutch East Indies and it would become one of the primary ancestors of ABN AMRO. The NHM merged with the &quot;Twentsche Bank&quot; in 1964, to form Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN). Also in 1964, the &quot;Amsterdamsche Bank&quot;, established in 1871, merged with the &quot;Rotterdamsche Bank&quot;, established in 1873 (as part of a merger that included &quot;Determeijer Weslingh &amp; Zn.&quot; from 1765), to form Amsterdamsche en Rotterdamsche Bank, known as AMRO Bank.

===ABN and AMRO merger===


On 22 September 1991, ABN and AMRO merged to form ABN AMRO. In 1993, two of its investment banking subsidiaries ― Bank Mees &amp; Hope and Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson ― merged in turn to form MeesPierson.

The two merged banks brought to ABN AMRO a large network of overseas companies and branches. From NHM, ABN owned a significant branch network in Asia and the Middle East, including the Saudi Hollandi Bank owned by the NHM Jeddah branch. Another, the Hollandsche Bank-Unie (HBU), which grew from the merger of the &quot;Hollandsche Bank voor de Middellandsche Zee&quot; (HBMZ) and the &quot;Hollandsche Zuid-Amerika Bank&quot; in 1933, gave ABN AMRO an extensive network of branches in South and Central America. In 1979, ABN had expanded into North America with the acquisition of Chicago-based LaSalle National Bank.

After the 1991 merger, ABN AMRO continued to grow through a number of further acquisitions, including the 1996-purchase of suburban Detroit based Standard Federal Bank followed five-years later by the acquisition of its Detroit-based competitor Michigan National Bank which was rebranded as Standard Federal. In 2005, Standard Federal became &quot;LaSalle Bank Midwest&quot; to unite ABN AMRO&#x27;s two banking networks in the U.S. In 1995, ABN AMRO purchased The Chicago Corporation, an American securities and commodities trading and clearing corporation.

Other major acquisitions included the Brazilian bank Banco Real in 1998, and the Italian bank Antonveneta in 2006. It was also involved in the controversial acquisition of the Dutch local government mortgage and building development organisation, the Bouwfonds in 2000. ABN AMRO sold the Bouwfonds as a going concern in 2006.

In July 2006, Favonius Ventures, which was founded and headed by Roel Pieper, received all of the technology investments of ABN AMRO Capital which is the private equity business unit of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.

===Mid-2000s weakness, acquisition and breakup===
ABN AMRO had come to a crossroads in early 2005. The bank had still not come close to its own target of having a return on equity that would put it among the top five of its peer group, a target that the CEO, Rijkman Groenink had set upon his appointment in 2000. From 2000 until 2005, ABN AMRO&#x27;s stock price stagnated. Financial results in 2006 added to concerns about the bank&#x27;s future. Operating expenses increased at a greater rate than operating revenue, and the efficiency ratio deteriorated further to 69.9%. Non-performing loans increased considerably year on year by 192%. Net profits were only boosted by sustained asset sales. In 2006, research findings were publicly released regarding ABN AMRO Bank N.V.&#x27;s predecessors and connections to African slavery. An examination of 200 predecessors of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. founded before 1888, determined that some had connections to African slavery, either in the United States or elsewhere in the Americas.

By 2007, ABN AMRO was the second-largest bank in the Netherlands and the eighth-largest in Europe by assets. At that time, the magazine &quot;The Banker&quot; and Fortune Global 500 placed it 15th in the list of world&#x27;s biggest banks and it had operations in 63 countries, with over 110,000 employees.

On 31 August 2007, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. Pakistan merged with Prime Commercial Bank which consisted of 69 branches across 24 cities for Sale of US$227 million and formed ABN AMRO Bank (Pakistan) Limited (Which later got merged into Royal Bank of Scotland Pakistan).

On 21 February 2007, The Children&#x27;s Investment Fund Management (TCI) hedge fund called to ask the Chairman of the Supervisory Board to actively investigate a merger, acquisition, or breakup of ABN AMRO, stating that the current stock price did not reflect the true value of the underlying assets. TCI asked the chairman to put its request on the agenda of the annual shareholders&#x27; meeting to be held in April 2007. Events accelerated on 20 March 2007, when the British bank Barclays and ABN AMRO both confirmed they were in exclusive talks about a possible merger.

On 28 March 2007, ABN AMRO published the agenda for the shareholders&#x27; meeting of 2007. It included all items requested by TCI, but with the recommendation not to follow the request for a breakup of the company.

However, on 18 April, another British bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) contacted ABN AMRO to propose a deal in which a consortium of banks, including RBS, Belgium&#x27;s Fortis, and Spain&#x27;s Banco Santander Central Hispano (now Banco Santander) would jointly bid for ABN AMRO and thereafter divide the components of the company among them. According to the proposed deal, RBS would receive ABN&#x27;s United States operations, LaSalle, and ABN&#x27;s wholesale operations; Banco Santander would take the Brazilian operations; and Fortis, the Dutch operations. The three banks set up a joint venture, RFS Holdings (with a name based on their respective initials), to execute the transaction.

On 23 April, ABN AMRO and Barclays announced the proposed acquisition of ABN AMRO by Barclays. The deal was valued at €67 billion and included the sale of LaSalle Bank to Bank of America for €21 billion.

Two days later, the RBS-led consortium brought out its indicative offer, worth €72 billion, if ABN AMRO would abandon its sale of LaSalle Bank to Bank of America. During the shareholders&#x27; meeting the next day, approximately 68 percent of the shareholders voted in favor of the breakup as requested by TCI.

The sale of LaSalle was seen as obstructive by many: as a way of blocking the RBS bid, which hinged on further access to the US markets, in order to expand on the success of the group&#x27;s existing American brands, Citizens Bank and Charter One. On 3 May 2007, the Dutch Investors&#x27; Association (Vereniging van Effectenbezitters), with the support of shareholders representing up to 20 percent of ABN&#x27;s shares, took its case to the Dutch commercial court in Amsterdam, seeking an injunction against the LaSalle sale. The court ruled that the sale of LaSalle could not be viewed apart from the current merger talks of Barclays with ABN AMRO and that the ABN AMRO shareholders should be able to approve other possible merger/acquisition candidates in a general shareholder meeting.
However, in July 2007, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled that Bank of America&#x27;s acquisition of LaSalle Bank could proceed and Bank of America absorbed LaSalle effective 1 October 2007.

On 23 July 2007, Barclays raised its offer for ABN AMRO to €67.5bn, after securing investments from the governments of China and Singapore, but it was still short of the RBS consortium&#x27;s offer. Barclay&#x27;s revised bid was worth €35.73 a share — 4.3% more than its previous offer. The offer, which included 37% cash, remained below the €38.40-a-share offer made the week before by the RFS consortium. The revised offer did not include an offer for La Salle Bank since ABN AMRO could proceed with the sale of that subsidiary to Bank of America. RBS would now settle for ABN&#x27;s investment-banking division and its Asian Network.

On 30 July 2007, ABN AMRO withdrew its support for Barclays&#x27; offer which was lower than the offer from the group led by RBS. While the Barclays offer matched ABN AMRO&#x27;s &quot;strategic vision,&quot; the board couldn&#x27;t recommend it from &quot;a financial point of view.&quot; The US$98.3bn bid from RBS, Fortis, and Banco Santander was 9.8% higher than Barclays&#x27; offer.

Barclays Bank withdrew its bid for ABN AMRO on 5 October, clearing the way for the RBS-led consortium&#x27;s bid to go through, along with its planned dismemberment of ABN AMRO. RFS formally acquired ABN AMRO on 17 October 2007. Fortis would receive ABN AMRO&#x27;s Dutch and Belgian operations, Banco Santander would get Banco Real in Brazil, and Banca Antonveneta in Italy and RBS would get ABN AMRO&#x27;s wholesale division and all other operations, including those in Asia.

===2008 financial crisis===
Both RBS and Fortis were increasingly visibly overextended following the ABN AMRO acquisition. On 22 April 2008, RBS announced the largest rights issue in British corporate history, which aimed to raise £12billion in new capital to offset a writedown of £5.9billion resulting from the bad investments and to shore up its reserves following the purchase of ABN AMRO. On 11 July 2008, Fortis CEO Jean Votron stepped down after the ABN AMRO deal had depleted Fortis&#x27;s capital. The total worth of Fortis, as reflected by its stock value, was at that time one-third of what it had been before the acquisition, and just under the value it had paid for the Benelux activities of ABN AMRO.

On 3 October 2008, Fortis was nationalised. The Dutch government bought a number of Fortis divisions plus Fortis&#x27;s share in ABN AMRO for EUR 16.8 billion. It subsequently announced that the parts of ABN AMRO it had acquired would be integrated with Fortis Bank Nederland (FBN) to create a new ABN AMRO. On 13 October 2008, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a UK government bailout of the financial system. The Treasury would infuse £37 billion ($64 billion, €47 billion) of new capital into Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Lloyds TSB and HBOS Plc, to avert financial sector collapse. This resulted in a total government ownership in RBS of 58%. As a consequence of this rescue, the chief executive of the group Fred Goodwin offered his resignation, which was duly accepted. Later in October, Fortis announced that it would sell its stake in RFS Holdings, which included all activities that had not been transferred yet to Fortis (i.e. everything except asset management).

===Disposals outside of the Netherlands===

In 2008, RFS Holdings completed the sale of a portfolio of private equity interests in 32 European companies managed by AAC Capital Partners to a consortium comprising Goldman Sachs, AlpInvest Partners and the Canada Pension Plan for $1.5 billion through a private equity secondary market transaction.

In September 2009, RBS rebranded the Morgans sharedealing business in Australia as RBS Morgans. This followed the rebranding of the ABN AMRO Australia unit to RBS Australia in March that year.

On 10 February 2010, RBS announced that branches it owned in India and the United Arab Emirates were to be rebranded under its name. HSBC Holdings said it would buy the Indian retail and commercial banking businesses of Royal Bank of Scotland for $1.8bn, however the deal fell-through in December 2012.

The operations owned by Santander, notably those in Italy and Brazil, were merged with Santander, sold or eliminated.

===Dutch operations restructuring===


The Dutch government had obtained full control of all Fortis operations in the Netherlands, including those parts of ABN-AMRO then belonging to Fortis, at a price of €16.8bn. The government and the De Nederlandsche Bank president have announced the merger of Dutch Fortis and ABN AMRO parts will proceed while the bank is in state ownership. This was completed in July 2010, when Fortis operations in the Netherlands were rebranded ABN AMRO.

In November 2008, a Belgian court dismissed a suit by shareholders of Fortis objecting to the Belgian government&#x27;s handling of the Fortis/ABN AMRO transaction and subsequent break-up.

The Dutch government appointed former Dutch finance minister Gerrit Zalm as CEO to restructure and stabilise the bank, and in February 2010 the assets it owned were legally demerged from those owned by RBS. This demerger created two separate organisations, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and The Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. The former was merged with ABN AMRO Private Banking, Fortis Bank Nederland, the private bank MeesPierson (formerly owned by the original ABN AMRO and Fortis) and the diamond bank International Diamond &amp; Jewelry Group to create ABN AMRO Group N.V., with the Fortis name being dropped on 1 July 2010. The remaining parts of the original ABN AMRO still owned by The Royal Bank of Scotland N.V., meanwhile, were renamed, sold or closed. As part of the agreement with the European Commission on state aid in the restructuring, ABN AMRO sold Hollandsche Bank-Unie to Deutsche Bank in April 2010, together with another subsidiary, IFN Finance.

===Post-restructuring history===

ABN AMRO acquired the specialist on-line mortgage provider &quot;Direktbank Hypotheken&quot; as part of the nationalisation and from 1 January 2011, it stopped selling these products under this brand to the public. It absorbed the mortgage business into its own products under the ABN AMRO brand as well as Florius brand.

In November 2020, ABN Amro announced it would cut 2800 jobs and sell its head offices as a plan to reduce costs, hoping to save €700 million by 2024.

In December 2023, ABN AMRO acquired BUX to boost its digital presence for an undisclosed amount.

In May 2024, ABN Amro agreed to buy Hauck Aufhäuser Lampe (HAL), a private bank specialised in wealth management, for 672 million euros ($730 million) from Fosun International.

In October 2024, the Dutch government announced its plan to reduce its stake in ABN Amro from 40.5% to 30% in the coming months.

==Operations==

ABN AMRO Bank has offices in 15 countries with 32,000 employees, most of whom are based in the Netherlands with only 5,000 in other countries. Its operations include a private banking division which focuses on high-net-worth clients in 14 countries as well as commercial and merchant banking operations that play a major role in energy, commodities and transportation markets as well as brokerage, clearing, and custody.

In April 2022, ABN AMRO Bank announced the company had signed a multi-year subscription extension with Switzerland based Banking and financial software development organisation Temenos. The deal was made to support ABN AMRO with customer growth and overall business expansion on the Temenos Banking cloud.

==Marketing==

The bank refers to itself as ABN AMRO in all capitals, based on an acronym of the two originating banks names Algemene Bank Nederland and the Amsterdam and Rotterdam Bank, in the second case the first two letters of each city make up the word AMRO. The letters in &#x27;ABN&#x27; are pronounced separately and &#x27;AMRO&#x27; is pronounced as a word. For this reason some media spell the name as &#x27;ABN Amro&#x27;. In written text both versions are used, although the bank itself uses only the uppercase version. In conversations, the bank is sometimes referred to as simply ABN or AMRO bank depending on one&#x27;s location around the world.

The green and yellow shield logo was designed by Landor Associates for ABN AMRO in 1991, and has been used as a brand for the bank and all its subsidiaries.

ABN AMRO was the main sponsor of Dutch football club AFC Ajax of Amsterdam from 1991 to 2008. The sponsor logo was at the time the only one in the world to be printed vertically down the right hand side of the front of the shirt. As of 2014, ABN AMRO is one of the strategic industry partners with Duisenberg School of Finance.

The bank&#x27;s former art collection has been managed since the end of 2007 by a dedicated foundation, the .

==Controversies==

===Madoff fraud===
As a result of the alleged fraud by Bernard Madoff, Fortis Bank Netherlands (Holding) NV lost 1 billion euros on loans from the bank (through its subsidiary Prime Fund Solutions, part of Fortis Merchant Banking) to hedge fund and as collateral investments in Bernard Madoff Investment Securities. The Dutch government said on behalf of Fortis that a claim against the Securities and Exchange Commission would be considered.

===Goldman Sachs SEC lawsuit===
ABN AMRO was mentioned by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court filings when it sued Goldman Sachs and one of Goldman&#x27;s collateralized debt obligation (CDO) traders on 16 April 2010. The SEC alleges that Goldman defrauded both IKB Deutsche Industriebank and ABN AMRO by its failure to disclose that the CDOs it sold to both banks were not assembled by a third party, but instead through the guidance of a hedge fund that was counterparty in the CDS transaction. This hedge fund, Paulson &amp; Co., stood to reap great financial benefit in the event of default.

===Diamond Financing===

ABN AMRO bank is one of the main banks financing the diamond business. ABN AMRO had branches in Botswana, New York, Hong Kong, Mumbai and Dubai, all of which they have sold or are in process of closing. They currently only have a branch in Antwerp, where they are also shrinking their business.

<doc id="383977" wikidata="Q1386411" url="?curid=383977" title="Walter Scott (Canadian politician)">
<text>Thomas Walter Scott (October 27, 1867 – March 23, 1938) was the first premier of Saskatchewan from 1905 to 1916. Scott was Saskatchewan&#x27;s second longest-serving Premier, serving one continuous term from 1905 to 1916). He led the Saskatchewan Liberal Party in three general elections, winning all three with majority governments before retiring. He was the first of six Liberal Premiers to date. He was succeeded by William Melville Martin. Scott was also the minister of various departments during his tenure as premier. Prior to the creation of Saskatchewan in 1905, Scott was a Member of Parliament in the federal House of Commons of Canada, elected in the general elections of 1900 and 1904.

==Early life==
Scott was born in 1867 in London Township, Ontario, in rural southwestern Ontario, the child of George Scott and Isabella Telfer. He was born out of wedlock, a fact he kept secret for his entire life. He moved to Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, in 1885, and then – at the age of 19 – to Regina, the capital of the North-West Territories, in 1886. He worked for and then ran a number of newspapers which supported the Liberal Party of Canada.

He became a partner in the Regina &quot;Standard&quot; from 1892 to 1893. From 1894 to 1895, he was the owner and editor of the &quot;Moose Jaw Times&quot;. Scott then bought the Regina &quot;Leader&quot; (known today as the &quot;Regina Leader-Post&quot;) in 1895, and was its editor until 1900.

During this period, Scott gained a measure of fame as pitcher for a local baseball team.

==Federal politics: Creation of Saskatchewan==
In 1900, Scott ran as a Liberal in the federal riding of Assiniboia West and was elected to the House of Commons. He was re-elected in 1904. During the discussions about creating provinces out of the North-West Territories, Scott initially supported territorial Premier Frederick Haultain&#x27;s proposal to create one big province (to be named &quot;Buffalo&quot;) out of what is today Alberta and Saskatchewan – but then converted to the two-province option favoured by Sir Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberal government.

In February 1905, the federal Government of Canada introduced legislation to create the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan effective July 1, 1905 (Dominion Day). Premier Haultain was resolutely opposed to this legislation since 1) he wanted one big province, not two provinces; and 2) under the terms of the legislation, the federal government retained jurisdiction over public land. Haultain&#x27;s opposition – along with opposition in the Commons to the act&#x27;s provisions for denominational separate schools – delayed the passage of the bill. It did not receive royal assent as the &quot;Saskatchewan Act&quot; until July 20. It came into force on September 1, 1905, creating the province of Saskatchewan.

On August 16, 1905, the Liberal Party of Saskatchewan held a leadership convention. Scott was the lone candidate. During his speech to the convention, the new leader of the Saskatchewan Liberals confidently predicted that Saskatchewan would soon become Canada&#x27;s &quot;banner province&quot;.

After the passage of the &quot;Saskatchewan Act&quot; and the creation of the province, the final step was setting up the government. Frederick Haultain, as the Premier of the North-West Territories, was a natural candidate for being either the first Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan or the first Premier. However, Haultain&#x27;s opposition to the division of the Territories into two provinces, the denial of natural resources, and the Catholic school provisions had led the federal government to mistrust him. Prime Minister Laurier therefore appointed Amédée E. Forget, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories since 1898, as the first Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan. Forget then named the 37-year-old Scott as Premier of Saskatchewan. Some believed that he acted on the advice of Laurier while he was staying with Forget at Government House for the celebration of the creation of Saskatchewan, but Laurier denied having given that advice. The appointment created some controversy, both in the Canadian capital of Ottawa and in Saskatchewan. Scott was sworn into office on September 12, 1905.

==First administration (1905–1908) ==
The new province&#x27;s first election was held on December 13, 1905. (Scott had arrived in Regina on December 13, 1886, so the day held sentimental value for him.) Scott&#x27;s Liberals ran under the slogan &quot;Peace, Progress, and Prosperity.&quot; Scott easily retained the premiership, with his Liberals winning 16 seats in the provincial legislature, while Haultain&#x27;s newly created Provincial Rights Party won only 9. (Though the popular vote was closer than this would indicate, with 52% of the vote going to the Liberals and 47% to the PRP.)

Saskatchewan&#x27;s first legislative session was convened at the end of March 1906. The major issue dominating this first session was the selection of a capital city. (Regina had only been named temporary capital.) Scott had assumed that Regina would remain the capital, but in May – at a secret meeting of the Liberal caucus – Scott was shocked to learn that two-thirds of his caucus supported moving the capital to Saskatoon. Scott insisted on Regina, though, and his caucus eventually fell in line – when the Liberal MLA from Saskatoon, W.C. Sutherland, introduced a resolution to move the capital to Saskatoon on May 23, 1906, the motion was defeated by a vote of 21–2 in the legislature.

Scott, who was the minister of public works in addition to serving as premier, now began a search for a suitable location for the new Legislative Building. In late June 1906, his cabinet formally approved the location of the current legislature. They agreed to develop the area around the legislature into a public park (Wascana Park), which is today the largest urban park in North America. Following a design competition, the commission for the new Legislative Building was awarded to Maxwells of Montreal in December 1907.

In 1907, Scott appointed the province&#x27;s first Royal Commission, the Municipal Commission, to study the issue of local government. This resulted in the &quot;Rural Municipality Act&quot; of 1908–9, which created nearly 300 Rural Municipalities (a form of local government unique to Saskatchewan and Manitoba) which are each in area. During this period, Scott was the first Commissioner, then Minister, for Municipal Affairs, in addition to his duties as premier.

A third major policy initiative during Scott&#x27;s first premiership involved telephone service. In 1907, the government appointed telephone expert Francis Dagger to study the issue, and the result, in 1908, was Saskatchewan&#x27;s famous solution of letting rural residents form mutual or co-operative companies to provide local phone services.

The Scott government also concerned itself with transportation. In 1906, the Scott government spent nearly $100,000 on highway construction – a figure which would increase tenfold over the course of Scott&#x27;s first term in office. During this period, Scott also served as the Commissioner of Railways.

The Scott administration also undertook a major expansion of public education in Saskatchewan. Between 1905 and 1913, the number of public schools jumped from 405 to 2,747. Normal schools were opened in Regina and Saskatoon.

Scott was also very interested in higher education, having promised the creation of a provincial university during the 1905 election campaign. In spring 1907, the legislature passed the &quot;University Act&quot;, designed to create a university for the province. In August 1908, Walter Murray, a philosophy professor from the Maritimes, was appointed as the first president of the new institution, although the site of the university had not yet been determined.

During the winter of 1906-07, Scott suffered a bout of pneumonia. From this point on, he left the province every fall in search of a warmer setting. In total, he spent approximately half of his tenure as premier outside of the province.

==Second administration (1908 – 1912)==
In August 1908, Scott was re-elected as premier of Saskatchewan. For this election, the legislature had been expanded to 41 seats, and Scott&#x27;s Liberals won 27 of these seats. Also in 1908, the Scott government passed the &quot;Children&#x27;s Protection Act&quot; to care for neglected and dependent children.

In April 1909, over the opposition of President Murray, the government decided to locate the new University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. The university&#x27;s first classes were held in the Drinkle Building downtown in September 1909, while plans were made to develop the university on the east side of the South Saskatchewan River on land well suited for agricultural research.

Since Scott favoured a policy of decentralization (evidenced in the university going to Saskatoon instead of Regina), he continued this policy. In 1907, he appointed a commission to decide where to locate the provincial insane asylum, with it eventually being built in North Battleford in 1913. Further pursuing his scheme of decentralization, Prince Albert was awarded the provincial penitentiary in 1911.
In October 1909, the Governor General of Canada, the Earl Grey was on hand to lay the cornerstone of the Saskatchewan Legislature, which Premier Scott had recently decided should be made out of Tyndall stone.

Continuing the policy of encouraging the development of transportation facilities, in 1909 the government agreed to back railway construction bonds (up to a limit of $13,000/mile) to encourage the Canadian Northern Railway and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway to build new lines in Saskatchewan. By the time of the Great War, this programme had created more than of new rail track in the province.

In 1910, Scott appointed another royal commission, the Magill Commission, to study the issue of grain elevators. In October, the commission rejected proposals to create government-owned elevators, opting instead for a system of elevators owned and operated co-operatively by farmers.

==Third administration (1912 – 1916)==
In the 1912 election, the Legislature was expanded again, and Scott&#x27;s Liberals won 46 of the 54 ridings. By this point, their opposition – the Provincial Rights Party – had decided to re-join mainstream politics and renamed itself the Conservative Party. Haultain resigned as leader in the wake of the 1912 electoral defeat.

Saskatchewan&#x27;s importance in Confederation and the wider British Empire was confirmed in October 1912 when the Legislative Building was officially opened by Queen Victoria&#x27;s favourite son Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, who was then the Governor General.

Scott also served as Minister of Education in his third administration. In 1913, he introduced legislation to require religious minority ratepayers (i.e. Catholics) to support their own separate schools. This proposal met with fierce opposition from the Rev. Murdoch Mackinnon, pastor of Regina&#x27;s Knox Presbyterian Church (Scott&#x27;s own congregation) who was resolutely opposed to measures which would financially strengthen the position of the Roman Catholic Church. Mackinnon would remain a thorn in Scott&#x27;s side – as late as 1919 fiercely denouncing Scott&#x27;s compromise position of allowing up to 1 hour a day of French language instruction in public schools.

Another development in 1913 was the creation of a provincial Board of Censors to deal with the corrupting influence of new-fangled motion pictures.

With the commencement of hostilities in World War I, Scott called an emergency session of the Saskatchewan Legislature on September 15, 1914. He pledged that all government MLAs would contribute 10% of their salaries to the Canadian Patriotic Fund, and that the province would donate 1500 horses to the British war effort. The Leader of the Opposition immediately rose to applaud these measures, and the session ended with Liberal and Conservative members joining in a rousing chorus of &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

Scott had long claimed to be in favour of women&#x27;s suffrage, but as of 1912, Scott was musing that women didn&#x27;t really want the vote. Pressed on the matter in early 1914, he said that he didn&#x27;t feel his government had a mandate from the people to enact such a major change as introducing female suffrage. When, however, in late 1915, Scott learned that Manitoba had enacted women&#x27;s suffrage, he was quick to follow suit – introducing legislation on February 14, 1916, to allow women to vote.

Scott had longed opposed the prohibition of alcohol, but the war made it all but impossible to resist the pressure of temperance advocates. In a March 1915 speech in Oxbow, Scott announced that all drinking establishments in Saskatchewan would be closed as of July 1, to be replaced by provincially run liquor stores. This move would prove inadequate in the following months, as both Alberta and Manitoba enacted Prohibition. Sensing the sign of the times, Scott held a provincial referendum on the topic – the first time women had been allowed to vote in Saskatchewan – and in December 1916, 80% of Saskatchewan voters voted to ban alcohol in the province.

Scott&#x27;s departure from politics by this time was virtually certain, for two main reasons. First, he had become increasingly prone to bouts of depression – with his outburst against his own pastor, Murdoch Mackinnon, during the debate about educational policy, serving as indication to his supporters that he was no longer entirely up for the job of premier.

Second, in February 1916, Conservative MLA J.E. Bradshaw alleged in the House that Liberals had been receiving kickbacks for highway work, liquor licences, and public building contracts. A Royal Commission was appointed, and several Liberal backbenchers were indicted and eventually convicted. Amidst the scandal, Scott stepped down as premier on October 16, 1916.

==Electoral history==

Scott was the second-longest serving Premier of Saskatchewan, with one continuous term, from September 6, 1905, to October 20, 1916. He was in office for a total of . Scott led the provincial Liberals in three general elections, winning majority governments in all three (1905, 1908, 1912).

Scott was elected three times to the Legislative Assembly and twice to the federal House of Commons. He was never defeated at the polls.

Scott is one of only four Saskatchewan premiers to win three or more majority governments, the others being Tommy Douglas, Allan Blakeney, and Brad Wall. Scott and the Liberals won over 50% of the popular vote in each of the three general elections, and also increased their number of seats in the second and third elections. The only other Saskatchewan premier to match this feat to date has been Brad Wall.

=== Saskatchewan general elections, 1905 to 1912 ===
==== 1905 General election ====


The first general election matched Scott and the Liberals against Haultain, former Premier of the North-West Territories, and the Provincial Rights Party. Scott and the Liberals won a substantial majority over Haultain.

1 Premier of Saskatchewan when election was called; Premier after the election.&lt;br&gt;
2 Premier of the North-West Territories prior to creation of Saskatchewan; Leader of the Opposition after the election.

==== 1908 General election ====


Scott again led the Liberal Party in the second general election, on August 14, 1908. Haultain was again his opponent, for the Provincial Rights Party. Scott was returned to office.

1 Premier when election was called; Premier after the election.&lt;br&gt;
2 Leader of the Opposition when election was called; Leader of the Opposition after the election.

==== 1912 General election ====


Scott again led the Liberal Party in the third general election, on July 11, 1912. The Provincial Rights Party by this time had re-named itself the Conservative Party of Saskatchewan, now led by Wellington Willoughby. Scott was returned to office.

1 Premier when election was called; Premier after the election.&lt;br&gt;
2 Leader of the Opposition when election was called; Leader of the Opposition after the election. &lt;br&gt;
3 The Legislative Assembly had 54 seats, but the election in Cumberland was declared void, resulting in a vacancy in the Assembly until a by-election was called on September 8, 1913.

=== Saskatchewan constituency elections ===

Scott stood for election to the Legislative Assembly three times, in two different ridings. He was elected each time.

==== 1905 General election: Lumsden ====

E Elected.

==== 1908 General election: Swift Current ====

E Elected.

==== 1912 General election: Swift Current ====

E Elected. &lt;br&gt;
X Incumbent.

==== 1900 General election: Assiniboia West ====
==== 1904 General election: Assiniboia West ====
==Life after public office==
Scott travelled widely in the years following his departure from public life in 1916. His mental health never allowed him to re-engage in politics or public affairs, nor any significant employment. He ultimately settled in Victoria, British Columbia, with his wife. His mental health did not improve and in 1936 he was committed to a private psychiatric home in Ontario for well-off patients. He died there in 1938 and is buried in Victoria. The circumstances of his death were not made public in Saskatchewan.

==Honours==
The Walter Scott Memorial was unveiled in 2012 in Wascana Centre, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building. The memorial is a full figured bronze statue of Scott facing the Legislative Building, holding a blueprint of the building, which he oversaw construction of while premier.

The &quot;Walter Scott Building&quot; on Albert Street in Regina was named in Scott&#x27;s honour, and is the home of many provincial government agencies and departments.

In 2000, Gordon Barnhart, former Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan, released the first detailed biography of Walter Scott.

A bust of Scott was commissioned by the provincial government as part of its &quot;Millennial Busts&quot; project.

Scott Collegiate, a high school in Regina, is named after Scott.

<text>Alfred Drake (October 7, 1914 – July 25, 1992) was an American actor and singer.

==Biography==
Born as Alfred Capurro in New York City, the son of parents emigrated from Recco, Genoa, Drake began his Broadway career while still a student at Brooklyn College. He is best known for his leading roles in the original Broadway productions of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; and for playing Marshall Blackstone in the original production of &quot;Babes in Arms,&quot; (in which he sang the title song) and Hajj in &quot;Kismet,&quot; for which he received the Tony Award. He was also a prolific Shakespearean, notably starring as Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; opposite Katharine Hepburn.

Drake was mostly a stage and television actor; he starred in only one film, &quot;Tars and Spars&quot; (1946), but played several roles on television, including providing the voice for the Great Ak in the Rankin-Bass stop-motion animated adaptation of the L. Frank Baum novel &quot;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&quot;. He appeared in a minor film role as president of the commodities exchange in the classic comedy &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), with Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd. His first musical television appearance was as Captain Dick Warrington in the January 15, 1955 live telecast of the operetta &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;. This followed by his portrayal of Marco Polo in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Marco Polo&quot; on NBC Television&#x27;s musical anthology series &quot;Max Liebman Presents&quot; in 1956.

Drake headlined the musical stage version of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Kean&quot; on Broadway in 1961 with a score by Forrest and Wright, although it was a major flop. His 1964 stage performance as Claudius in the Richard Burton &quot;Hamlet&quot; was filmed live on the stage of the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, using a &quot;quickie&quot; process called Electronovision, and shown in movie theatres in a very limited engagement. It was also recorded on LP. His final appearance in a Broadway musical was in 1973-74 as Honoré Lachaille in Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s &quot;Gigi&quot;. Two years later he starred in a revival of &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;.

As a director he staged the 1974 premiere of &quot;The Royal Rape of Ruari Macasmunde&quot; at the Virginia Museum Theater. He was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981.

He was also a published author – writing at least a few plays: &quot;Dr. Willy Nilly&quot;, an adaptation of Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Doctor in Spite of Himself&quot;, an adaptation of Goldoni&#x27;s &quot;The Liar&quot;, and even at least one book on cards (specifically Gin rummy).

Drake was president of The Players from 1970 to 1978, a social club in New York City for people of the theatre, started in 1889 by actor Edwin Booth.

==Death==
Alfred Drake died of heart failure, after a long fight with cancer, in New York City on July 25, 1992, at age 77. He was survived by his wife Esther, his two daughters Candace Olmsted and Samantha Drake, and two grandchildren.

<text>Sudan Airways () is the national airline of Sudan, headquartered in Khartoum. Since 2012, the company has been fully owned by the Government of Sudan.

One of the oldest African carriers, it was formed in and started scheduled operations in July the following year. , Sudan Airways had 1,700 employees. The airline has been included in the list of air carriers banned in the European Union .

==History==
An Air Advisory Board was formed in 1945 to assess on the feasibility of starting air services in the country, recommending to set up an air company with the aid of foreign carriers that would provide their technical and management expertise. Initially, the new airline would restrict its operations to on-demand services. Sudan Airways was formed in February 1946 with the technical assistance of Airwork Limited, and the commercial support of Sudan Railways. 

The initial fleet was composed of four de Havilland Doves, with test flights commencing in . The first scheduled operations were launched in July the same year, with the first timetable being published in September. Khartoum became Sudan Airways&#x27; hub from the very beginning. From there, the carrier started flying four different services all across the Sudanese territory, as well as to the not yet independent Eritrea. The first routes the company flew linked Khartoum with Asmara, Atbara, El Fashir, El Obeid, Geneina, Juba, Kassala, Malakal, and Port Sudan, all of them served by de Havilland Dove aircraft. An Airwork Viking flew the Blackbushe–Khartoum long-haul route. A fifth Dove was ordered in . That year, a route to Wadi Halfa was launched. Sudan Railways withdrew from the airline&#x27;s management in 1949; the government and Airwork continued running the company thereafter.

Kassala and Asmara were removed from the airline list of destinations in 1952. In February that year, a fifth Dove was phased in. There was such a demand for flying that the toilets on the Doves were removed to make room for more seats, with these aircraft even carrying passengers in the cockpit. This prompted the airline to look for newer and bigger airliners, with the Douglas DC-3 and the de Havilland Heron being under consideration. Flown with Austers and Doves, by the carrier was operating a domestic network that was long. That year, the carrier incorporated the first four DC-3s into the fleet. The boost in capacity allowed the company to carry both passengers and mail, to introduce new regular routes to Cairo and Wad Medani, and to carry out aerial survey tasks for the government. Also in 1953, the Chadian city of Abeche was made part of the route network, whereas regular flights to Jeddah were launched in . Services to Athens commenced in the mid-1950s. Two more DC-3s were bought in 1956. In 1958, after taking office, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces decided to expand the carrier&#x27;s international operations. A seventh DC-3 was incorporated into the fleet that year. Long-haul services started in June 1959 between Khartoum and London via Rome –the so-called &quot;Blue Nile&quot; service– using a Viscount 831 that was acquired new earlier that year in a joint venture with British United Airways. Beirut was added to the destination network in November the same year. Also in 1959, the airline joined IATA.

By , the fleet included seven DC-3s, four Doves, and a Viscount 831. The latter aircraft was used to resume operations to Asmara in . Aimed at replacing the DC-3s and the Doves in domestic and regional routes, the airline acquired three Fokker F27s in October that year; these were delivered in early 1962, with the first of them being deployed on domestic routes, making Sudan Airways the first African airline in operating the type. Also in 1962, two Comet 4Cs were bought in May, intended as a replacement of the Viscount service; Sudan Airways had considered the acquisition of two jets for deployment on the ″Blue Nile″ route since the frequency on the service was increased to twice weekly in 1961.

By , the route network totaled , with international destinations including Aden, Addis Ababa, Asmara, Athens, Beirut, Cairo, Entebbe, Fort Lamy, Jeddah, London, Nairobi and Rome. At this time, the fleet was composed of two Comet 4Cs, three DC-3s, four F-27s and three Twin Otters. The last passenger DC-3 left the fleet in 1971. In 1972, the Comets were put on sale and were replaced by two Boeing 707s leased from British Midland. Sudan Airways ordered two Boeing 707-320Cs in 1973, for delivery in June and . Pending delivery of two Boeing 737-200Cs ordered a year earlier, the two Boeing 707-320Cs were part of the fleet by , along with five F-27s, three Twin Otters, and a single DC-3.

The company had 2,362 employees at , with an aircraft park that included one Airbus A300-600, one Airbus A300-600R, three Boeing 707-320Cs, one Boeing 727-200, one Boeing 737-200C and one Fokker F27-600.

In 2007, the Sudanese government privatised the airline, maintaining only a 30% stake of the national carrier. The Kuwaiti private group that owned 49% of the shares since then sold its stake back to the state in 2011.

In the wake of the crash of Flight 109, in the airline was grounded following an indefinite suspension of its operating certificate by the Sudanese government, despite the fact that it was stated as not being in connection with the accident. This decision was later rolled back, and the company was allowed to resume operations.

In 2017, it was announced that the Sudanese President Omar al Bashir signed several cooperation agreements with King Salman of Saudi Arabia during a visit to Riyadh. Among the agreements was a pledge from the Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation to restructure SAR22.5 million riyals (US$6 million) worth of debt. In addition, provisions for fleet renewal at Sudan Airways were also made. It was reported Saudi Arabia may equip the Sudan Airways with fourteen aircraft including three B777s, three A320-200s, six Embraer Regional Jets, and two A330-200s.

<doc id="383996" wikidata="Q886109" url="?curid=383996" title="John Alden Dix">
<text>John Alden Dix (December 25, 1860 – April 9, 1928) was an American businessman and politician who served as 38th governor of New York from January 1911 to January 1913.

A native of Glens Falls, New York, Dix attended Cornell University before becoming active in several Dix family business ventures. He later expanded into the lumber and paper industries, where his success made him wealthy.

Dix became active in politics as a Democratic Party, and served terms as chairman of the Washington County Democratic Committee and the New York State Democratic Committee. In 1908, Dix was an unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York.

In 1910, Dix was the successful Democratic nominee for governor, and he served one two-year term, January 1911 to December 1912. His term was largely concerned with issues of workplace safety in the wake of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. In 1912, Dix ran for reelection, but lost the Democratic nomination to William Sulzer.

After leaving the governorship, Dix returned to management of his business interests. In retirement he became a resident of Santa Barbara, California. He died in New York City in 1928, and was buried in Albany, New York.

==Life==
John Alden Dix was born on December 25, 1860, in Glens Falls, New York, to Laura (née Stevens) and James Lawton Dix. His maternal great-grandparents, Ozias (1750–1835) and Lucy Hatch Dix (1752–1831), were first cousins. His second cousin, twice removed is Daniel H. Wells. He graduated from Glens Falls Academy and attended Cornell University from 1879 to 1882. He was a member of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity.

==Career==
After college, Dix was employed in the Dix family businesses, including a quarry and a machine shop, for five years. He then worked in a lumber business called Thomson &amp; Dix in Thomson with Lemon Thomson. In 1897, the firm was dissolved after the death of Thomson. He then purchased Thomson&#x27;s interest and developed a paper mill in Thomson and manufactured paper. He was president of the Iroquois Paper Company, treasurer of the American Woodboard Company, president of the Albany Securities Company, vice president of the Blandy Paper Company and manager of the Moose River Lumber Company. He was the first vice president of the First National Bank of Albany and director of the National Bank of Schuylerville, Albany Trust Company and the Glen Falls Trust Company.

===Political career===
Dix also became involved in politics, including serving as a delegate to the 1904 Democratic National Convention, and chairman of the Washington County and New York State Democratic Committees. In 1906, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor at the party&#x27;s state convention.

In 1908, Dix was the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor of New York on the ticket with Lewis S. Chanler, but was defeated.

Dix ran for governor again in 1910; he won the Democratic nomination, and won the November general election. During his term, Dix established a New York State Factory Commission to investigate factory conditions, a reaction to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire; as a result of the commission&#x27;s work, 32 worker safety laws were enacted by the legislature and approved by Dix. After a fire destroyed a large portion of the state capitol building, Dix successfully advocated state legislation that improved fire safety regulations and building codes.

Other Dix accomplishments in office included creation of the state Conservation Commission, the law authorizing direct primary elections, and a law limiting work weeks to 54 hours. In 1912 he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. He also ran for reelection in 1912, but lost the Democratic nomination to William Sulzer.

==Personal life==
On April 24, 1889, Dix married Gertrude Alden Thomson of Albany, the daughter of Lemon Thomson, his business partner. Gertrude&#x27;s sister, Nancy Sherman Thomson (1867–1927), was married to State Senator Curtis N. Douglas (1856–1919). He was warden of St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Schuylerville.

After leaving office Dix retired to Santa Barbara, California. He was also active in civic endeavors including service on the Cornell University board of trustees. In 1912, he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Hamilton College.

Mrs. Dix died in Santa Barbara in 1923; the couple had no children.
Dix died in New York City on April 9, 1928, and was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands.

==The other Governor Dix==
John Alden Dix had the same first and last name as Union General and Governor of New York John Adams Dix, and was often referred to in the press as a nephew or a first cousin once removed of John Adams Dix. In fact, John Alden Dix had no known family relationship with John Adams Dix.

==Trivia==
Governor Dix planned to sail to Europe with his wife on April 20, 1912, aboard the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. For obvious reasons this journey was canceled.

<doc id="384001" wikidata="Q7774887" url="?curid=384001" title="The Wild Party (poem)">
<text>The Wild Party is a book-length narrative poem, written by Joseph Moncure March, who also wrote &quot;The Set-Up&quot;.

Published in 1926 by Pascal Covici, Inc., the poem was widely banned, first in Boston, for having content viewed as lewd. The poem was a success notwithstanding, and perhaps in part due to, the controversy surrounding the work. March&#x27;s subsequent projects were more mainstream.

The poem tells the story of show people Queenie and her lover Burrs, who live in a decadent style that March depicts as unique to Hollywood. They decide to have one of their parties, complete with illegal bathtub gin and the couple&#x27;s colorful, eccentric and egocentric friends, but the party unfolds with more tumultuous goings-on than planned.

&lt;poem&gt;
Some love is fire: some love is rust:
But the fiercest, cleanest love is lust.
And their lust was tremendous. It had the feel
Of hammers clanging; and stone; and steel:
And torches of the savage, roaring kind
That rip through iron, and strike men blind:
Of long trains crashing through caverns under
Grey trembling streets, like angry thunder:
Of engines throbbing; and hoarse steam spouting;
And feet tramping; and great crowds shouting.
A lust so savage, they could have wrenched
The flesh from bone, and not have blenched. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

A new hardcover edition was released in 1994 with the subtitle &quot;The Lost Classic&quot;. It featured about fifty black-and-white illustrations by Art Spiegelman, a long-time admirer of the poem. In his introduction to the volume, Spiegelman recalls his first meeting with writer William Burroughs. He indicates that the conversation was stilted until Spiegelman asked if the elderly Burroughs had ever encountered March&#x27;s poem. &quot;Burroughs had first read the book in 1938, when he was a graduate student at Harvard,&quot; Spiegelman wrote. &quot;&#x27;The Wild Party,&#x27; [Burroughs] mused &#x27;...It&#x27;s the book that made me want to be a writer.&#x27;&quot; Spiegelman recalls that Burroughs then recited the opening couplet of the poem, in a manner that gave Spiegelman the impression that Burroughs could have continued the recitation, perhaps even to the final lines.

&quot;The Wild Party&quot; was adapted into a film version in 1975, and two stage musicals, both produced in New York City in the same 1999–2000 theater season. Michael John LaChiusa&#x27;s version, directed by George C. Wolfe was mounted on Broadway and the other version, by Andrew Lippa, performed off-Broadway. &quot;The Wild Party&quot; has been translated into French, German, Spanish, and Danish.

An altered quote from the first two lines of &quot;Part II, ch. 9&quot; was used in the 1959 Ian Fleming novel &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, although Fleming did not credit March. He also changed the word &quot;fiercest&quot; to &quot;finest&quot;.

<text>The County of Brant (2021 population 39,474) is a single-tier municipality in the Canadian province of Ontario. Although it retains the word &quot;county&quot; in its name, the municipality is a single-tier municipal government and has no upper tier. The County of Brant has service offices in Burford, Paris, Oakland, Onondaga and St. George. The largest population centre (2021 population 14,956) is Paris.

The County of Brant is a predominantly rural municipality in Southern Ontario. The county is bordered by the township of North Dumfries in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo; the City of Hamilton; Haldimand County; Norfolk County; and the townships of Blandford-Blenheim and Norwich in Oxford County. The County abuts the provincially-mandated Greenbelt. Although the city of Brantford is surrounded by the County, it is a fully independent city with its own municipal government. The Brant census division, which includes Brantford and the Six Nations and New Credit reserves along with the County of Brant, had a population of 144,771 in the 2021 census.

The county is named after Joseph Brant and was established in 1851. Brantford separated from the county when it incorporated as a city in 1877. Part of the County is situated on the Haldimand Tract, traditional territory of the Neutral, Mississauga, and Haudenosaunee peoples.

== History ==
The area had previously been part of Wentworth and Oxford County. Brant County was formed in 1851 and originally consisted of:
*Brantford Township (Brantford, Paris, Mount Pleasant, Cainsville). Area . First settlement made before 1810. The township was organized in 1840.
*Burford Township (Burford, Scotland), Area . First of the midland townships to have settlers. Surveyed in 1793, four families settled on the land before 1800.
*Oakland Township (Scotland, Oakland). Area . Originally called the Townsend Gore, then the Burford Gore, but organized a separate municipality in 1850.
*Onondaga Township (Onondaga, Middleport). Area . First settled in 1838 within Oxford County. The formal surrender of the township by local Indigenous peoples did not take place until 1839.
*South Dumfries Township (Paris, St. George, Glen Morris). Area .
*Tuscarora Township (Six Nations Indian Reserve, New Credit Indian Reserve), created in 1784.

On January 1, 1999, the Town of Paris and the townships of Brantford, Burford, Oakland, Onondaga, and South Dumfries amalgamated to form a new city with the official legal name of County of Brant.

=== Early history ===
Erected by the provincial and federal governments, historic plaques and monuments in Brant County indicate a long and varied history which include many aspects related to the First Nations.

The Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant (Thayendanega) and the Mohawk people of New York state served with the British during the American Revolution. In 1784, the Crown granted Joseph Brant and his followers a land treaty along the Grand River to replace what they had lost in New York State at the Sandusky Council after the Revolution. Much of this grant was later rescinded. As chief of the united tribes, Brant led his people—including Brant&#x27;s African slaves captured during the revolution—to Upper Canada; a group of 400 settled in 1788 on the Grand River at Mohawk Village which later became Brantford. Nearly a century later (1886), the Joseph Brant Memorial would be erected in Burlington, Ontario in honour of Brant and the Six Nations Confederacy.

The Mohawk Chapel, built by the British Crown in 1785 for the Mohawk and Iroquois people (Six Nations of the Grand River), was dedicated in 1788 as a reminder of the original agreements made with the British during the American Revolution. 
In 1904 the chapel received Royal status by King Edward VII in memory of the longstanding alliance. Her Majesty&#x27;s Royal Chapel of the Mohawks is an important reminder of the original agreements made with Queen Anne in 1710. It is still in use today as one of two royal Chapels in Canada and the oldest Protestant Church in the province. Joseph Brant and his son John Brant are buried here.

Significant to the county, gypsum was discovered in 1793 on the east bank of the Grand River in what became Paris during a survey for the British Home Department. By late 1794 a road had been built from what is now Dundas, Ontario to Paris, called The Governor&#x27;s Road (now Dundas St. in Paris). Records from 1846 indicate that the settlement (now Paris), in a hilly area called Oak Plains, was divided into the upper town and the lower town. In addition to successful farmers in the area, the community of 1000 people (Americans, Scottish, English, and Irish) was thriving. Manufacturing had already begun, with industries powered by the river. A great deal of plaster was being exported and there were three mills, a tannery, a woolen factory, a foundry, and numerous tradesmen. Five churches had been built; the post office was receiving mail three times a week. The village was incorporated in 1850 with Hiram &quot;Boss&quot; Capron as the first Reeve. It was incorporated as a town in 1856 with H. Finlayson as the first mayor.

Abraham Dayton from Connecticut arrived in 1793 and was granted the entire township of Burford; additional settlers began arriving in 1797. The 1814 Battle of Malcolm&#x27;s Mills during the War of 1812 took place at what is now Oakland when American forces attacked the local regiments. Neither this battle nor the 1837 Duncombe&#x27;s Uprising by militant &quot;Patriots&quot; at the settlement of Scotland were successful.

Chief John Brant (Mohawk leader) (Ahyonwaeghs) who had lived at Mohawk Village was one of the sons of Joseph Brant. He fought with the British during the War of 1812 and later worked to improve the welfare of the First Nations. He was involved in building schools and was the improving the welfare of his people. Brant initiated the opening of schools and from 1828 served as the first native Superintendent of the Six Nations. Chief Brant was elected to Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for Haldimand in 1830 and was the first aboriginal Canadian in Parliament.

Records from 1846 indicate that the settlement of Scotland in Burford Township had a population of about 150. At that time there were two stores, two taverns, one tannery, one saddler, one chair maker, one cabinet maker, one blacksmith. There was also a carding machine and fulling mill near the village. Nearby Oakland had about 160 inhabitants; its post office was receiving mail daily. Oakland had a grist and a saw mill, a carding machine and fulling mill, one store, two taverns, one hatter, one wagon maker, one blacksmith, one tailor, one shoemaker.

Much of the county&#x27;s early population began arriving in the 1820s as the Hamilton and London Road was improved and settlement increased after 1848 when navigation to Brantford was opened and again in 1854 with the arrival of the railway to Brantford. The stone and brick Brant County Courthouse was built on land purchased from the Six Nations in 1852. The structure housed court rooms, county offices, a law library and a gaol. During additions in the 1880s, the Greek Revival style, with Doric columns, was retained.

Chiefswood, now a Six Nations museum in Oshweken and one of the National Historic Sites of Canada, was built in about 1856 by Mohawk Chief George Henry Martin Johnson (Onwanonsyshon). His daughter, the Mohawk poet E. Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake), gained great acclaim across Canada. Her work increased awareness of the history and cultural diversity of the First Nations. In 1886, the Joseph Brant Memorial was constructed in honour of Brant and the Six Nations Confederacy.

===Railway development===

Brant County saw relatively early railway development in Ontario&#x27;s history, as it lay nearby and between major mid-19th century centres such as Toronto and London. Plans for railway development were underway in the 1830s as part of the proposed London and Gore Railroad between London and Hamilton, with a branch line planned to extend northward to Galt. After significant delays, the London and Gore eventually appeared in the form of the Great Western Railway, whose mainline opened between Hamilton and London in 1853.

Work had begun on the branch line to Galt in 1852, and it was completed in 1854. The branch line, as built, connected to the roughly east–west mainline at a junction in Brant County located at a key point aligned between four major manufacturing and administrative centres in the area: Brantford, Galt, Hamilton, and London. Originally known simply as Fairchild Creek Station, the railway town which grew up around the junction was eventually named Harrisburg after the then-president of the Great Western Railway, Robert W. Harris. This early construction date has led to some Ontario rail history writers such as Joachim Brouwer and Ron Brown to argue that Harrisburg was the first railway junction in Canada, and that the branch line to Galt was the first branch line in Canadian railway history. A second branch line, this one to Brantford, was also built south from Harrisburg in 1871, though an independent shortline named the Buffalo, Brantford and Goderich Railway reached Brantford earlier, in the 1850s.

=== Invention of the telephone ===
Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone at his father&#x27;s homestead, Melville House, now the Bell Homestead National Historic Site. At the time, the homestead was in the County, outside the Brantford city limits. In a 1906 speech, Bell made the following comment, &quot;the telephone problem was solved, and it was solved at my father&#x27;s home&quot;. As well, two of the first successful voice transmissions of any notable distance were made in early August 1876, between the telegraph office in Brantford, Ontario and Melville House and Between Paris and Brantford.

Canada&#x27;s first telephone factory, created and operated by James Cowherd, was also located in Brantford from about 1879 until his death in 1881. The first telephone business office which opened in 1877, not far from the Bell Homestead, was then located in the County just outside Brantford.

<text>Peaches Browning (born Frances Belle Heenan; June 23, 1910August 23, 1956), was an American actress. She was married to New York City real estate developer Edward West &quot;Daddy&quot; Browning (October 16, 1874 – October 12, 1934), when she was 15 and he was 51.

==Biography==

Browning and Heenan met at a sorority dance on the evening of March 5, 1926, at the Hotel McAlpin and immediately began a very public courtship, despite the difference in their ages. Browning was 51, and Heenan was 15. Browning, who reveled in publicity, paraded Heenan in front of the paparazzi cameras as he lavished her with expensive gifts (spending $1000 a day on shopping trips) and took her to New York&#x27;s finest restaurants in his distinctive peacock blue Rolls-Royce automobile. On April 10, 1926, mere weeks after they met, Peaches and &quot;Daddy&quot; were wed in the village of Cold Spring, New York, far from media scrutiny. Both Peaches&#x27; father and her mother gave their permission for the marriage, which took place in part to thwart a campaign by Vincent Pisarra of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children to halt their relationship. Peaches was the victim of an acid attack shortly before her wedding from an unidentified perpetrator.

The White Plains, New York, trial drew intense coverage by New York City tabloid newspapers such as the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, the rival &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; and the more disreputable &quot;New York Graphic&quot;, which published a series of notorious composographs of the couple. The story was covered in depth by the national newspapers, from the tabloids to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the couple became well known in U.S. popular culture of the time. Their romance is referenced in the 1927 Gershwin musical comedy &quot;Funny Face&quot; and F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s short story &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, published the same year.

On October 2, 1926, Peaches and her mother loaded up their belongings and left the marital residence at the Kew Gardens Inn. Under New York law at the time, divorce was only possible if one party admitted adultery, so Peaches tried to obtain a legal separation, claiming cruelty. Among the notable aspects of the case were Peaches&#x27; allegations of odd behavior by her husband, including the fact that he kept a honking African goose in their bedroom. The phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t be a goof,&quot; which Daddy allegedly used as an insult to Peaches, came into national vogue, and later turned up in the lyrics of the title song from the 1936 Rodgers and Hart musical comedy &quot;On Your Toes&quot;. The judge accepted Daddy&#x27;s version of the facts, ruling that Peaches had abandoned her husband without cause, and permitted him a legal separation without any obligation to pay alimony. Peaches remained legally married to Browning until his death from a brain hemorrhage. She went on to have and divorced three more husbands. She also had an affair with Milton Berle.

Peaches&#x27; notoriety gained her a career in vaudeville. She was managed by Marvin Welt (1883–1953), one of the first theatrical agents to demand a percentage of total ticket sales for some of his clients. She died at New York Hospital in Manhattan, New York City, on August 23, 1956, at age 46, after slipping in the bathroom at her apartment. She was buried in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

<doc id="384009" wikidata="Q212846" url="?curid=384009" title="L.A. Woman">
<text>L.A. Woman is the sixth studio album by the American rock band the Doors, released on April 19, 1971, by Elektra Records. It is the last to feature lead singer Jim Morrison during his lifetime, due to his death exactly two months and two weeks following the album&#x27;s release, though he would posthumously appear on the 1978 album &quot;An American Prayer&quot;. Even more so than its predecessors, the album is heavily influenced by blues. It was recorded without producer Paul A. Rothchild after he quit the band over the perceived lack of quality in their studio performances. Subsequently, the band co-produced the album with longtime sound engineer Bruce Botnick.

&quot;Love Her Madly&quot; was released as a single in March 1971, preceding the album&#x27;s release, and reached the Top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Upon release, the album peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reached number 28 on the UK Albums Chart. The track &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; also achieved chart success.

Critics including Richie Unterberger and David Quantick have called &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; one of the Doors&#x27; best albums, citing Morrison&#x27;s vocal performance and the band&#x27;s stripped-down return to their blues-rock roots.

== Background ==

The Doors had achieved commercial and critical success by 1969, but for much of that year they were blacklisted from radio playlists and their concert bookings dwindled after singer Jim Morrison had been charged with profanity and indecent exposure at a concert in Miami, Florida. Morrison had mentioned leaving the group at the end of 1968, only to be convinced by keyboardist Ray Manzarek to stay on another six months. On September 20, 1970, Morrison was convicted for the Miami incident. In a 1970 interview with Ben Fong-Torres, Morrison said of Miami, &quot;I think subconsciously I was trying to get across in that concert, I was trying to reduce it to absurdity. And it worked too well.&quot;

In November 1970, shortly after Morrison&#x27;s trial ended, the Doors entered Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles to record early versions of the songs &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; and &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;. The new songs were a departure from the heavily orchestrated pieces on the earlier album &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, which burdened the group with long, drawn-out recording sessions. The simplified and straightforward style, progressing from &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot;, was well-received, noted by &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine as &quot;a return to the tight fury of early Doors&#x27; music&quot;. The band conflicted with their record company, Elektra Records, who released the Doors&#x27; first compilation album, &quot;13&quot;, to have a product for the Christmas market. It was released without the band&#x27;s input, and featured a large image of a younger Morrison, upsetting him enough to threaten signing with another label. As their contract required one more album, the group were unable to follow through with the threat, so they continued rehearsing the new material.

Record producer Paul A. Rothchild, who worked with the band on their first five albums, attended the early sessions but quit following friction with the band. This included his dissatisfaction with the song &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;, which &quot;drove [him] out of the studio.&quot; He felt that recording the composition was a step backwards artistically, calling it &quot;cocktail music.&quot; Rothchild has denied a popular rumor that claimed he directed the remark toward &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;, explaining that he thought that song and &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; were &quot;excellent in rehearsal&quot;. He maintains that his cocktail music comment was said to &quot;make [the group] angry enough to do something good.&quot; Rothchild was frustrated that the group was slow in developing new material, especially as the band contained three songwriters. He was unable to persuade Morrison to consistently attend rehearsals. As Bruce Botnick revealed in the book &quot;Love Becomes a Funeral Pyre&quot;, another issue that led to Rothchild&#x27;s leaving was the emotional devastation he felt at the death of Janis Joplin, having worked with her on &quot;Pearl&quot;. Rothchild left before any master takes were complete, recommending that the Doors co-produce &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; with Botnick, the sound engineer who had worked with Rothchild on the band&#x27;s previous recordings.

== Recording ==

The group and Botnick organized a makeshift recording studio at their private rehearsal space, the Doors&#x27; Workshop, a two-story building at 8512 Santa Monica Boulevard. They could then record in a more comfortable and relaxed setting while avoiding the expenses of a professional studio. A mixing console previously owned by Elektra was installed upstairs in the Workshop, while studio monitors, microphones, and keyboards were set up downstairs. To compensate for the lack of an isolated vocal booth, Morrison recorded in the bathroom doorway, singing into the same microphone used on the Doors&#x27; final tour. According to Botnick, Morrison was easy to work with and spent long hours in the studio with little consumption of alcohol.

For recording, Elvis Presley&#x27;s bassist Jerry Scheff and rhythm guitarist Marc Benno were brought in to provide additional backing. Densmore characterized Scheff as &quot;an in-the-pocket man&quot; for his steady supportive role, and praised how Scheff &quot;allowed me to communicate rhythmically with Morrison, and he slowed Ray down, when his right hand on the keyboards got too darn fast&quot;. By all accounts, Morrison – a huge Presley fan – was excited by Scheff&#x27;s participation. In addition, Benno was asked to participate as a result of his recent notoriety from working with Leon Russell. The songs were completed in a few takes on a professional-quality 8-track recorder, and the album was finished in six days. Morrison was a blues enthusiast and proclaimed the final recording session as &quot;blues day&quot;, recording &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot;, &quot;Cars Hiss by My Window&quot;, and &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;. The album had a raw, live sound with overdubs mostly limited to additional keyboards. Botnick explained, &quot;The overall concept for the recording session was to go back to our early roots and try to get everything live in the studio with as few overdubs as possible&quot;. Mixing was completed at Poppi Studios in West Hollywood, by which time Morrison had moved to Paris.

== Music ==
The band began recording without much material and needed to compose songs on the spot, either by jamming or talking through ideas. In a 1994 interview, guitarist Robby Krieger stated, &quot;Rothchild was gone, which is one reason why we had so much fun. The warden was gone.&quot; Despite its troubled beginnings, &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; contains some of the Doors&#x27; most critically acclaimed songs, as well as some of their most blues-oriented. Lyrically, the album deals with contemporary topics such as love, life in Los Angeles, and complex aspects of the human experience. Manzarek explained the band did not &quot;approach the album with one vision, but after we started working on the songs, we realized that they&#x27;re talking about L.A. They&#x27;re about men, women, boys, girls, love, loss, lovers-lost, and lovers-found in Los Angeles&quot;. The album, as a whole, demonstrated Morrison&#x27;s songwriting abilities, combined with his poetic phrasing and enthusiasm for Los Angeles but still a desire to leave the city with his partner, Pamela Courson. Artistically, &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; saw the band mixing blues and rock, with some elements of psychedelic and jazz rock of their early career.

=== Songs ===
==== Side one ====
&quot;L.A. Woman&quot; opens with the Morrison-penned track &quot;The Changeling&quot;, which the Doors wanted to be the album&#x27;s first single. Taken from one of Morrison&#x27;s journals written in 1968, Holzman overruled the group&#x27;s decision in favor of &quot;Love Her Madly&quot; and the non-album B-side &quot;(You Need Meat) Don&#x27;t Go No Further&quot;. 
Morrison also contributed &quot;Been Down So Long&quot;, a song inspired by folk singer Richard Fariña&#x27;s book &quot;Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me&quot; and Furry Lewis&#x27;s tune, &quot;I Will Turn Your Money Green&quot;. A conventional blues song reminiscent of Morrison&#x27;s potential imprisonment from earlier Doors performances, the lyrics showed depression, liberation, and sexuality. Additionally, Morrison wrote the blues number &quot;Cars Hiss by My Window&quot;. Unlike most of the other tracks, it was composed in the studio. Manzarek recalled that &quot;Jim said it was about living in Venice [Beach], in a hot room, with a hot girlfriend, and an open window, and a bad time. It could have been about Pamela Courson&quot;. Of the remaining self-written material on &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, Krieger wrote &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;, which echoed his songs of romance and insecurity. He wrote the song, at his house, to alleviate his boredom during Morrison&#x27;s trial.

&quot;L.A. Woman&quot; closes its first side with the title track, the lengthiest song on the album. Thought of as Morrison&#x27;s final goodbye to Los Angeles, it communicated his mixed feelings of passion and disdain for &quot;the city of night&quot;. The lyrics feature an anagram for Jim Morrison: &quot;Mr. Mojo Risin. Krieger&#x27;s electric guitar effect at the introduction impersonates the sound of an accelerated automobile engine.

==== Side two ====
In addition to &quot;The Changeling&quot;, the Doors chose to incorporate three other compositions written before 1971: &quot;L&#x27; America&quot;, &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot;, and &quot;The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)&quot;. &quot;L&#x27;America&quot; was intended for the soundtrack of director Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s 1970 counterculture film &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;, but ultimately rejected. Manzarek recalled, &quot;Antonioni was interested in using it in &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;. So we played it for him, and it was so loud, it pinned him up against the wall. When it was over, he thanked us and fled. So he turned to Pink Floyd, as European filmmakers tend to do when they want rock &amp; roll.&quot; Previously titled &quot;Latin America&quot;, it was originally written and recorded during the sessions for &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot;, and the only work during the &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; sessions with a few drum overdubs. The Doors&#x27; arrangement of the traditional &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot; dates back to their early tours, and was sometimes coupled with Morrison&#x27;s poem &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot;. &quot;The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)&quot; is a reworking of Morrison&#x27;s sample of poetry first appearing on the group&#x27;s souvenir books in 1968.

&quot;L.A. Woman&quot; also features &quot;Hyacinth House&quot;, with lyrics written by Morrison and music by Manzarek. The song shows Manzarek being influenced by the Polish composer Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53, during its organ solo. The final track was &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;, a collective effort by the Doors. Based on the arrangement &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; and the line &quot;delicate riders of the storm&quot;, taken from Hart Crane&#x27;s poem &quot;Praise for an Urn&quot;, the track melded Morrison&#x27;s hitchhiker imagery from his own poetry projects. The faint, ghostly backdrop heard throughout the song was the last recording of Morrison as a member of the Doors.

== Live performances ==
After Morrison recorded poetry at Village Recorders on December 8, 1970, he felt encouraged to play some &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; material on tour. On December 11, the Doors performed in front of two sold-out audiences at the State Fair Music Hall in Dallas. The band opened the first concert with an extended &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;, but struggled on older material as they had not played live since the Isle of Wight FestivaI that August. The set included &quot;The Changeling&quot; and &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; and closed with &quot;When the Music&#x27;s Over&quot;. The concerts were well received, proving the Doors were still a capable live act and leading to an extra performance in Louisiana. Audience recordings from the Doors&#x27; performances of &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;, &quot;The Changeling&quot;, &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, and the &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; track &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; were included on the 2003 album &quot;Boot Yer Butt: The Doors Bootlegs&quot;.

On December 12, the Doors played the Warehouse in New Orleans for what turned out to be their last live performance with Morrison. Midway through the set, a drunk Morrison began slurring the lyrics to &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, interrupted with speeches and jokes. He sat in front of the drum platform in between Krieger and Manzarek&#x27;s solos, but did not stand up to finish the song. After prompting by Densmore, he tried to sing, before bashing the mic stand into the stage until its wood splintered. The Doors agreed to stop touring and focus on completing &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;.

For years, fans speculated over the possible recordings of the New Orleans concert. In 2011, George Friedman, a stage manager of the Warehouse, revealed he had a reel to reel recording of the gig secured in a safety deposit box. He explained he discovered the tapes &quot;when Beaver Productions moved its offices out of the Warehouse, Uptown into a building at the Riverbend. The Doors tape, along with a stack of other Warehouse show tapes, were cast off and left behind as debris during the move&quot;. Despite the confirmation of their existence, there has yet to be an official release of the recordings.

== Release and reception ==

&quot;L.A. Woman&quot; was released on April 19, 1971. It reached number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, remaining on the charts for 36 weeks, and reached number 28 in the UK, spending four weeks on the UK Albums Charts. The first cover pressing had a burgundy-colored, curved-corner cardboard cutout sleeve, framing a clear embossed cellophane insert, glued in from behind. Photography was credited to Wendell Hamick. According to Jac Holzman, chief executive officer of Elektra Records: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t sure there would be another album ever, so I had Bill Harvey create a collector&#x27;s cover. The Doors&#x27; faces were printed on clear film. The backing color of the inner sleeve could be changed and would affect the mood of the package. This is the first album in which Jim is bearded on the front cover. His photo is on the right, no bigger, no smaller than the others, just another guy in the band.&quot;
Three months after release, on July 3, Morrison was found dead. There had been discussions between Morrison and the others for future recording after he returned from Paris. The album was accompanied by the &quot;Love Her Madly&quot; single, which was released in March and charted at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for a stay of 11 weeks, but failed to chart in the UK. An additional single, &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;, was edited and released in June, and reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, while managing to peak at number 22 in the UK chart.

The album received mostly positive reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Robert Meltzer was impressed by the sense of fun and the togetherness of the band, saying it was &quot;the Doors&#x27; greatest album&quot; and the best album of the year. Reviewing in &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, critic Roy Carr called it &quot;one of their best in sometime,&quot; praising it as having &quot;great depth, vigour and presence.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote a not-so-favorable review, commending some cuts, especially the &quot;effective electric piano&quot; of &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;, but deemed the rest of the album as just &quot;staleness&quot;, and that it&#x27;s &quot;all so obvious that originality has left them&quot;. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau appreciated Morrison&#x27;s sense of humor in some of the lyrics and believed &quot;the band has never sounded better&quot;, although he was disappointed with &quot;Been Down So Long&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;America&quot;. In his 1994 book &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of The Doors&quot;, Peter K. Hogan describes the album as an expansion on the style from &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot;, but in a more coherent form. He also believed &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; was a fitting swan song for Morrison, who was pleased to finally record a blues-oriented album.
Sal Cinquemani, reviewing the album for &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, considers &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; to be &quot;the sound of a band in perfect harmony&quot;. He describes the Doors&#x27; material as &quot;disturbing and cynical over the years, and these songs were no exception&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cinquemani/Slant&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;PopMatters&quot;″s Nathan Wisnicki said Morrison&#x27;s lyrics were less pretentious than previous work because of &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;″s &quot;more conventional blues&quot;. Stephen Dalton of &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, reviewing the 40th Anniversary Edition of the album, remarks how &quot;the original &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; still stands proud, an all-time classic journey into bright shining darkness.&quot; David Quantick from &quot;BBC Music&quot; attributed the record&#x27;s success to &quot;a stripped-down yet full sound, a developed mysticism tied tightly to the band&#x27;s brand of rock, and confidence born of having been a functioning unit for several years&quot;. Richie Unterberger, writing for AllMusic, described &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; as &quot;uneven&quot;, but noted that the album contains compositions that &quot;rate among their finest and most disturbing work&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; was ranked number 362 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. When the list was revised in 2012, to accommodate a number of albums released since 2003, the album was repositioned at number 364. Both &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;Stereogum&quot; named it the Doors&#x27; second best album, with the latter&#x27;s Ryan Leas adding in the website, &quot;It traveled the same raw blues-rock lane as its predecessor, but now the Doors sounded ragged, bleary. It&#x27;s one of those early-&#x27;70s records that comes off like a beleaguered hangover from the end of the &#x27;60s.&quot; Online newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; cited &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; the twelfth best album of 1971, while &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included it among the &quot;Top 100 &#x27;70s Rock Albums&quot;.

=== Reissues and remasters ===
In 1988, &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; was digitally remastered by Botnick and Paul A. Rothchild at Digital Magnetics, using the original master tapes. DCC Compact Classics reissued the album on 24kt gold CD in 1993 and on 180g vinyl in 1998, both versions were mastered by Steve Hoffman. It was remastered again in 1999 for &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set by Bernie Grundman and Botnick at Bernie Grundman Mastering, using 96khz/24bit technology; it was also released as a standalone CD release. This was followed by a 5.1 surround version of the album, released on DVD-Audio on December 19, 2000; the surround mix was created by Botnick from the original eight-track analog 1&quot; master tapes. In 2006, all six of the Doors&#x27; albums with Morrison were remixed in stereo and 5.1 for the &quot;Perception&quot; box set. This edition of &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; includes two bonus tracks (&quot;Orange County Suite&quot; and &quot;(You Need Meat) Don&#x27;t Go No Further&quot;) and was made available with or without an accompanying DVD that features the 5.1 surround sound version of the album along with Doors&#x27; rehearsal footage. This remix series has been criticized because &quot;the band chose to remix and tinker with [the albums], adding and cutting from a few tracks and including unused instrumental parts.&quot; For example, &quot;Cars Hiss By My Window&quot; features an extra verse and other additions for a new length of 4:58 (as opposed to 4:10 on the original). In 2009, the album was reissued on 180g vinyl featuring the original mix, cut by Grundman.

In 2012, &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; was digitally remastered again as a part of &quot;The Years of the Doors&quot; series to commemorate its 40th Anniversary release. This edition was reissued in an expanded format on January 24, 2012, by Elektra and Rhino Records in CD and digital formats, and it includes the 2006 stereo remix done and mastered by Botnick at Uniteye. It also features seven alternate versions of songs, and two previously unreleased tracks, &quot;She Smells So Nice&quot; and &quot;Rock Me&quot;. This remaster has been praised for leaving the original album &quot;untouched&quot;. To accompany this release, a documentary titled &quot;Mr. Mojo Risin&#x27;: The Story of L.A. Woman&quot; was distributed. The film includes interviews with all three remaining band members, as well as live and studio performances. Analogue Productions also reissued the album on hybrid SACD (2013) and double 45 RPM vinyl (2012), both editions were mastered by Doug Sax and Sangwook Nam at The Mastering Lab; the CD layer of the Super Audio CD contains the original stereo mix while the SACD layer contains Botnick&#x27;s 2006 5.1 surround mix. To commemorate the album’s 50th anniversary, Rhino released a three-CD/one-LP set on December 3, 2021. It was remastered by Botnick using the Plangent Process and includes the original stereo mix and two bonus discs of unreleased studio outtakes.

==== &quot;L.A. Woman Sessions&quot; special edition ====
Rhino released on April 23, 2022 (as a RSD exclusive) the studio outtakes from the 50th Anniversary three-CD/one-LP set as a special edition quadruple vinyl entitled &quot;L.A. Woman Sessions&quot;.

<doc id="384011" wikidata="Q2551670" url="?curid=384011" title="Moonlight Drive">
<text>&quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; is a song by American rock band the Doors, released in 1967 on their second album &quot;Strange Days&quot;. It was edited to a 2:16 length for the 45 rpm single B-side of &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot;. Though a conventional blues arrangement, the track&#x27;s defining feature was its slightly off-beat rhythm, and Robby Krieger&#x27;s &quot;bottleneck&quot; or slide guitar, which creates an eerie sound.

==Composition==

The song is one of the first written by the lead singer Jim Morrison. According to the Jerry Hopkins and Danny Sugerman biography &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;, Morrison wrote &quot;Moonlight Ride&quot; during his halcyon days on a rooftop in Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California, in 1965. Later on, when he happened upon his friend and future band member, Ray Manzarek, he uttered the memorable lines, &quot;Let&#x27;s swim to the moon, let&#x27;s climb through the tide, penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide.&quot; Reportedly Manzarek was awestruck, and they decided to form a band. Morrison already had a band name picked out: the Doors.

&quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; was recorded along with other songs during the group&#x27;s first demo recordings at Trans World Pacific Studios. It was recorded the following year for the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album, but eventually did not appear; this was due to the band members&#x27; dissatisfaction with the result, which differ from the later album version. This version was finally released as an outtake, on the 40th Anniversary edition of the debut album.

==Performances==
Recordings of live performances of the song reveal a link to a sort of death by drowningwhether murder, suicide or simply going too far. Morrison sings in live performances, probably improvising, referring to &quot;fishes for your friends&quot; and &quot;pearls for your eyes&quot; conjuring an image of a rotten corpse lying at the bottom of the ocean while simultaneously referring to Shakespeare. Morrison also read the &quot;Strange Days&quot; poem &quot;Horse Latitudes&quot; during live performances of the song, before repeating the final lines of the song&#x27;s third verse, as demonstrated on the version that first appeared on &quot;Alive, She Cried&quot;.

==Personnel==

* Jim Morrison – vocals
* Ray Manzarek – hohner clavinet, tack piano
* Robby Krieger – bottleneck guitar
* John Densmore – drums

<doc id="384012" wikidata="Q3510750" url="?curid=384012" title="Rick &amp; the Ravens">
<text>Rick &amp; the Ravens was an American surf rock and frat rock band founded in 1961, known as the forerunner of the Doors. Members Ray Manczarek, John Densmore, and Jim Morrison renamed the group in the latter half of 1965 after joining forces with Robby Krieger.

Rick &amp; the Ravens recorded three singles on Aura Records and a demo acetate containing six songs that were later re-recorded on The Doors&#x27; albums.

== History ==

=== Line-ups ===

The band initially consisted of Rick Manczarek on guitar, Jim Manczarek on organ and harmonica, Patrick Stonier on saxophone, Roland Biscaluz on bass, and Vince Thomas on drums. The drummer and bass player were initially not permanent members, but asked to join whenever a gig was upcoming. The name of the band partly stems from guitarist &amp; Manczarek brother Rick.

In 1962, Ray Manczarek, having moved to Los Angeles from Chicago, joined on vocals and occasional piano. The family&#x27;s name was spelt Manczarek, with an additional letter &#x27;c&#x27;; but, Ray alone changed the spelling to &quot;Manzarek&quot; later on upon joining The Doors.

=== Performances ===

The band performed on weekends for college crowds, mostly from UCLA Film School, at a bar called the &quot;Turkey Joint West&quot; on Santa Monica Boulevard, a British pub operated by the Santa Monica Soccer and Social Club, since 1974 known as &quot;Ye Olde King&#x27;s Head&quot;. Their concert setlist consisted of their own original songs, padded with covered versions of blues standards such as &quot;I&#x27;m Your Doctor, I Know What You Need&quot; by Muddy Waters, &quot;Louie Louie&quot; by Richard Berry, Barrett Strong&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot;, and Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man.&quot;

In an interview conducted by Rainer Moddemann, Manzarek stated the first song Jim Morrison performed with Rick &amp; the Ravens was Richard Berry&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. Morrison was not officially part of the band at that time; Manzarek simply invited his former college colleague on stage, much to everyone&#x27;s surprise. Morrison was reportedly not prepared for this, his first public performance, and sang himself hoarse. Morrison and Manzarek had met previously and found they shared a lot of musical and artistic interests. Later Manzarek asked Morrison to join the band and he accepted.

=== The 1965 World Pacific Demo ===

On September 2, 1965 the band entered World Pacific Studios in Los Angeles and recorded six songs that would eventually become Doors songs: &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;, &quot;My Eyes Have Seen You&quot;, &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;, &quot;Go Insane&quot; (known simply as &quot;Insane&quot; on the acetate), &quot;End of the Night&quot;, and &quot;Summer&#x27;s Almost Gone&quot;. The recording session was a relatively quick affair, only lasting three hours in total. Singer Morrison was reportedly delighted to hear his voice on a record for the first time. The demo was released in its entirety on &quot;The Doors: Box Set&quot; in 1997. The tracks on the box set were mastered from Rick Manczarek&#x27;s original acetate which was one of only five made.

=== Transformation to the Doors ===

The 1965 Rick &amp; the Ravens demo features Jim Morrison on vocals, Ray Manczarek on piano and background vocals, John Densmore on drums, Rick Manczarek on guitar, Jim Manczarek on harmonica, and Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Hansen (&quot;née&quot; Sullivan, from Patty and the Esquires, the band she had with Chuck Oakes whom she later married) on bass guitar. The only future Doors member who was not featured on the demo is guitarist Robby Krieger.

Both Jim and Rick Manczarek were disappointed by the response the demo received after attempting to promote it, and they, along with Sullivan, were additionally not impressed with Morrison&#x27;s songs. Subsequently, Rick and Jim Manczarek quit the band, stating they felt it was &quot;going nowhere fast&quot;.

At Morrison&#x27;s suggestion, the band changed its name to the Doors a month after they had recorded the demo. Robby Krieger joined on guitar in October 1965, having earlier performed with Densmore in the Psychedelic Rangers. The Doors were initially a quintet, but when Manzarek decided to handle the bass duties with the newly introduced Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, Pat Sullivan was dropped from the line-up in December 1965, ultimately ending up with the &quot;classic&quot; Doors line-up of Morrison, Manzarek, Krieger, and Densmore.

All songs from the Rick &amp; the Ravens demo appear, in re-recorded and sometimes amended form, on later Doors releases. &quot;End of the Night&quot; appeared on the Doors&#x27; 1967 self-titled debut album, &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; and &quot;My Eyes Have Seen You&quot; appeared on the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Strange Days&quot;, and &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot; and &quot;Summer&#x27;s Almost Gone&quot; appeared on 1968&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;, both included as a result of Morrison&#x27;s struggles with alcoholism and lack of new songs at that time. The verse section of &quot;Go Insane&quot; became part of the &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; suite under the title &quot;A Little Game&quot;; a live version of &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; was released on 1970s &quot;Absolutely Live&quot;, with a rough studio attempt featuring on 2003&#x27;s &quot;.&quot;

== Former members ==

* Rick Manczarek – guitar 
* Jim Manczarek – organ, harmonica 
* Patrick Stonier – saxophone 
* Roland Biscailuz – bass 
* Vince Thomas – drums 
* Ray Manzarek – piano, vocals 
* Jim Morrison – vocals 
* John Densmore – drums 
* Patty Sullivan – bass 

== Discography ==

The singles were meant as promotional material only. They were never in wide circulation, nor were they even meant to be published outside the promotional circuits. On the &quot;Soul Train / Geraldine&quot; single, the artist is labeled &quot;Ray Daniels feat. Rick &amp; the Ravens&quot;, with &quot;Ray Daniels&quot; double billed. The last singles were initially meant as vehicles to promote Ray Manczarek (billed as &quot;Ray Daniels&quot;) as lead artist, with the Ravens merely a backing band. Promotional material presented the artist as &quot;Rick &amp; the Ravens featuring the Voice of Ray Daniels&quot;. These plans were discarded when Morrison joined the line-up.

=== Mislabels ===

All of these promo tracks have later ended up on various Doors bootlegs, erroneously labelling the tracks as songs by the Doors.

<text>Carol J. Adams (born 1951) is an American writer, feminist, and animal rights advocate. She is the author of several books, including &quot;The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Pornography of Meat&quot; (2004), focusing in particular on what she argues are the links between the oppression of women and that of non-human animals. She was inducted into the Animal Rights Hall of Fame in 2011.

== Biography ==
Carol J. Adams was born in New York in 1951. She is a feminist-vegan, advocate, activist, and independent scholar whose work explores the cultural construction of inter-sectional oppression. At a young age, Adams was influenced by her mother, who was both a feminist and a civil rights activist, and also her father who she recalls, was a lawyer who participated in one of the first lawsuits regarding the pollution of Lake Erie, one of the Great Lakes in the north eastern region of the United States. Adams was raised in Forestville, a small village in New York. After skipping a grade and taking college English courses in high school, Adams attended the University of Rochester and majored in English and History. As an undergraduate at the University of Rochester, she was involved in bringing women&#x27;s studies courses to the University&#x27;s course catalog. She graduated from there with a BA in 1972, and obtained her Master of Divinity degree from Yale Divinity School in 1976. In 1974 Adams moved to Boston to study with Mary Daly. Adams recalls her time with Mary as, &quot; a fascinating time of conversation and mutual critique...My evolving feminist-veganism
and her evolving biophilic philosophy bumped up against each
other at times. Usually, at least in the beginning, she had the last word.&quot; 

Adams recalls discovering the dead body of her family pony that was killed in a hunting accident, then eating a hamburger that night. She concluded that it was hypocritical for her to mourn the death of her pony, yet have no problem eating a slaughtered cow. This marked the beginning of her vegetarian journey. She is also a pioneer of feminist care theory in animal ethics. Adams continues to work towards the ethical treatment of animals and other forms of activism. She does this through visiting colleges, teaching courses, and through the internet and different forums of social media in which she can reach out to a wider audience. During the past five years Adams has been very involved in helping to create this innovative urban development spearheaded by The Stewpot in Dallas, Texas. Adams has also been working on a theoretical autobiography and on a book about Jane Austen and care giving. She has also been working on a project on &quot;Towards a Philosophy of Care through Care.&quot; An essay about this is forthcoming in Critical Inquiry. Adams continues to show The Sexual Politics of Meat Slide Show to help and spread her theories as she can. Lastly Adams is completing a book with her co-authors Patti Breitman and Virginia Messina, &quot;Even Vegans Die&quot;. Carol J. Adams in regards to her intentions on this planet said, &quot; &quot;In my life, I want to do the least harm possible,&quot;she said. &quot;I want to walk lightly on this Earth.&quot; and the accomplishments of her life and her goals and ambitions have reflected this philosophy. Adams was chosen as one of &quot;20 Badass Veg Women Who Are Making History&quot; by a website called chooseveg.com. Others among the list were the once world number one for women&#x27;s tennis, Venus Williams and Ellen DeGeneres, from the Ellen DeGeneres Show.

Adams is one of several people who provided information used in the writing of the book &quot;Striking at the Roots: A Practical Guide to Animal Activism&quot; (2008) by Mark Hawthorne.

== Career ==

=== &quot;The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory&quot; ===
&quot;The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory&quot; discusses how, especially in times of shortage, women often give men the meat they perceive to be the &quot;best&quot; food. She also discusses the connections between feminism and vegetarianism, and patriarchy and meat eating, historically and through the reading of literary texts. An important theory formulated in the book is the &quot;absent referent&quot;, which she uses to explain the fact that people keep eating meat, and is also behind the objectification of women in pornography.

In &quot;The Sexual Politics of Meat&quot;, Adams parallels the patriarchal system with the relationship between humans and animals. The male connotations associated with meat eating, not only highlights species inequality, but also defines distinct gender roles. Simply, meat signifies male dominance over females as &quot;men who batter women have often used the absence of meat as a pretext for violence against women.&quot; Adams proclaims that our culture has become preoccupied with reducing non-human animals to a source of consumption, a fragmentation of their individual species. A recurring theme throughout her work is that men that feel a sense of entitlement over animals are similar to men who abuse, exploit, or degrade women for their bodies.

=== &quot;Animals and Women Feminist Theoretical Explorations&quot; ===
In Adam&#x27;s &quot;Animals and Women Feminist Theoretical Explorations&quot;, she argues that the social context behind female oppression and sexual violence has a direct tie to the way humans mistreat other species. Humans tend to deem animals as an inferior species and in this way, justify their actions regarding animal exploitation. According to Adams, men regard women in a similar light. This sense of entitlement over animals translates into human relations and men begin to label women as inferior as well &quot;available for abuse.&quot; The established discourse shifts from a negative image for nonhuman animals to a sexist portrayal of women. Constantly, men refer to women using language such as dogs, chicks, bunny, which all indicate men using women as a mere means. Given current speciesism, individuals use non-human animals for their production, i.e. cows for milk, hens for eggs, or female dog to breed more puppies. Humans use chicks as simply physical beings similar to how men may exploit the female body for pleasure.

===&quot;The Pornography of Meat&quot;===
In &quot;The Pornography of Meat&quot;, Adams draws the visual comparison between meat advertised on a shelf and women portrayed in particular advertisements or magazines. The idea of consumption plays a significant role in a culture that compare women to a product, something that&#x27;s not only attainable, but a consumable person. It is important to note that consumption may refer to literal digestion or rather simply, a desire for someone considered attainable by another individual. Adams juxtaposes commonly unnoticed advertisements in the local grocery store to sexist and misogynistic images of women. Further, she creates the &quot;A&quot; category, which creates an idea of white male supremacy in a civilized society, whereas the other in this sense, includes language that relates to different races, non-human animals, and women. Adams argues that modern culture idealizes the white male figure and demonstrates that he represents an advanced civilized society. The author argues that any individual who doesn&#x27;t fall into the &quot;A&quot; category likely faces a reference to animals, now seen as derogatory and inferior. In this work, she includes an image of women labeled according to her body parts similar to how butcher advertises meat cuts. The underlying premise remains the same; current culture has created a desire for consumption from non-human animals, genders, and races.

=== Other works ===
She is the author of several other books, including &quot;Living Among Meat Eaters: The Vegetarian&#x27;s Survival Handbook&quot;. This book advises vegetarians to ask if they are at peace with their own vegetarianism and provides communication skills for avoiding abuse while dining with meat-eating friends, family, and coworkers who may be hostile. Her most recent work, &quot;Burger,&quot; follows the history, business, culture, and gendered politics of the hamburger. All the while, drawing upon the history of the veggie burger, and its revival through contemporary investors in the food industry.

Adams&#x27; activism includes &quot;experience of working for social justice (which includes justice for nonhuman animals) and against domestic violence, homelessness, racism, and violence against animals.&quot; A large part of Adams&#x27; life is dedicated to feminism as well. She was raised in a household with her two sisters where this spirit of feminism was nurtured. Her vegetarianism came after her feminism. While a sophomore at the University of Rochester she attended her first Women&#x27;s Liberation meeting and later did field work at the Women&#x27;s Liberation Center. These experiences and research, as well as the event of her pony being killed, showed her that her feminism and vegetarianism were related. Through some feminist studies she was conducting she realized that both were connected throughout the history of feminism as well. She found that many feminists were vegetarians, and she also found multiple books written by feminists, on vegetarianism as a &quot;part of the feminist awakening of the hero&quot;. A further look into the newly connected themes proved to be very important to the course Adams&#x27; work would take in the future. She found that a patriarchal ethics &quot;naturalizes and normalizes violence...and perpetuates human exceptionalism that permits the oppression of other beings&quot;. Thus her theory of the patriarchal essence begins, and the creation of &quot;The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory&quot; took form.

Adams has explained that her activism taught her how to write by allowing her to think about how &quot;ideas are experienced by others&quot;. Fighting on the non-dominant side of things through her activism allowed her to return to her book-writing with a deeper level of understanding sufficient to know what was going on. The voice she had in her activism in the 1970s also helped her obtain her theoretical voice used in her books. Adams explains, in many interviews, that her activism taught her how to write.

In her chapter, &quot;What Came Before the Sexual Politics of Meat&quot; in the book &quot;Species Matters: Humane Advocacy and Cultural Theory&quot;, Adams explains that she and her husband were activists in the 1970s against racism. They lived in Dunkirk, New York and tried to make the area progressive by pushing for minority housing to move into the rural area. Her husband, the local minister was receiving inflammatory letters from his congregation and Adams fought with inner self between doing as much as she can, and stopping where the situation became dangerous. She was spoken about on the call-in radio show &quot;What&#x27;s Your Opinion&quot;. One day when she was listening she was so furious about the inaccurate information being told that she called in and corrected all the misinformation. Regardless of what people said, Adams and her husband continued their activism and fight for low-to-moderate income housing.

Further, in her life Adams has supported animal rights and wants to educate people about vegan food and introducing people to vegan eating. She explains we all get protein from plants, some people get it directly from plants and others chose to let animals process protein for them; she has also coined the term feminized protein for eggs and dairy products, as it is plant protein produced by using the reproductive cycle of female animals.

== Personal life ==
Adams was executive director of the Chautauqua County Rural Ministry, Inc., Dunkirk, New York from the late 1970s to 1987. She lives in Texas with her husband, Reverend Dr. Bruce Buchanan, and is a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Dallas, where her husband is an associate pastor.

<doc id="384020" wikidata="Q7422290" url="?curid=384020" title="Sarah Emma Edmonds">
<text>Sarah Emma Edmonds (born Sarah Emma Evelyn Edmondson, married name Seelye, alias Franklin Flint Thompson; December 1841 – September 5, 1898) was a British North America-born woman who claimed to have served as a man with the Union Army as a nurse and spy during the American Civil War. Although recognized for her service by the United States government, some historians dispute the validity of her claims as some of the details are demonstrably false, contradictory, or uncorroborated.

== Early life == 
Edmonds was born in December 1841 in New Brunswick, Canada, then a British colony. The youngest child, she grew up with her sisters and brother, Thomas, on their family&#x27;s farm near Magaguadavic Lake, not far from the border with the U.S. state of Maine. She was abused by her father, who had wanted a boy to help with the crops on the farm. Thomas had &quot;fits,&quot; which was most likely to have been epilepsy. At age 15, Edmondson fled home to escape an arranged marriage; she was aided by her mother, who also had married young. She changed her last name to Edmonds in order to hide from her father, and started a millinery shop with a friend in Moncton, New Brunswick. Her father eventually found her, either by himself or through acquaintances, and Edmonds fled again to escape him.

She adopted the guise of Franklin Thompson to travel more easily. In addition, there are claims that her father had made her dress as a boy growing up, which would make her familiar and comfortable in a male role.

Thompson crossed into the United States and worked for Hurlburt and Company, a successful Bible bookseller and publisher in Hartford, Connecticut, selling Bibles door to door. Her boss, Mr. Hurlburt, claimed that she was the best salesman he had in 30 years of the business.

== Civil War service ==
Edmonds&#x27; interest in adventure was sparked in childhood by Maturin Murray Ballou&#x27;s book &quot;Fanny Campbell, the Female Pirate Captain&quot;, telling the story of Fanny Campbell and her adventures on a pirate ship during the American Revolution while dressed as a man. Campbell continued dressing as a man after the war in order to pursue other adventures. Edmonds used Campbell as an inspiration to &quot;escape the limitations of her sex.&quot; She enlisted in Company F of the 2nd Michigan Infantry on May 25, 1861, also known as the Flint Union Greys. She disguised herself as a man named Franklin Flint Thompson, the middle name possibly after the city of Flint, Michigan, where she volunteered. She felt that it was her duty to serve the United States, as it was her new country. She at first served as a field nurse, participating in several campaigns under General McClellan, including the First and Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, the Peninsula Campaign, Vicksburg, Fredericksburg, and others.

According to her memoir, Thompson&#x27;s career took a turn when an American spy in Richmond, Virginia, was discovered and put before a firing squad, and her friend James Vesey was killed in an ambush. Thompson took advantage of the open position, as well as the opportunity to avenge Vesey&#x27;s death, and became a spy. There is no proof in her military records that she actually served as a spy, but she wrote extensively about her experiences in her memoir.

She travelled into enemy territory to gather information, requiring her to come up with many disguises. One disguise required her to use silver nitrate to dye her skin black, wear a black wig, and walk into the Confederacy disguised as a Black man by the name of Cuff. Another time, she entered the Confederacy as an Irish peddler by the name of Bridget O&#x27;Shea, claiming that she was selling apples and soap to the soldiers. Once, she was posing as a black laundress working for the Confederates when a packet of official papers fell out of an officer&#x27;s jacket. She returned to the United States with the papers, and the generals were delighted. Additionally, she worked as a detective, Charles Mayberry, in Kentucky, uncovering a Confederate agent.

Thompson suffered an injury before the Second Battle of Bull Run in 1862, when she took a trip to Berry&#x27;s Brigade in order to deliver mail. In an attempt to take a shortcut, she was thrown into a ditch by her mule before reaching the brigade; she sustained severe injuries. In 1863, she contracted malaria. Doctors urged her to go to the hospital for treatment. Thompson abandoned her post in the army, fearing that she would be discovered as a woman if she went to a military hospital. She checked herself into a private hospital, intending to return to military life once she had recuperated.

Once she recovered, however, she saw posters listing Frank Thompson as a deserter. Rather than return to the army under another alias or as Frank Thompson, and risk execution for desertion, she decided to serve as a female nurse under her real name at a Washington, D.C. hospital for wounded soldiers run by the United States Christian Commission. There was speculation that Thompson may have deserted because of John Reid being discharged months earlier, and there is evidence in Reid&#x27;s diary that she had mentioned leaving before she had contracted malaria. Thompson&#x27;s fellow soldiers spoke highly of her military service, and even after her disguise was discovered, they considered her a good soldier. She was referred to as a fearless soldier and was active in every battle that her regiment faced.

==Memoir==
In 1864, Boston publisher DeWolfe, Fiske, &amp; Co. published Edmonds&#x27; account of her military experiences as &quot;The Female Spy of the Union Army&quot;. One year later, her story was picked up by a Hartford, Connecticut publisher who issued it with a new title, &quot;Nurse and Spy in the Union Army&quot;. It was a huge success, selling in excess of 175,000 copies. Edmonds donated the profits from her memoir to &quot;various soldiers&#x27; aid organizations.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1867, she married Linus H. Seelye, a mechanic with whom she bore three children, but all three died in their youth, leading the couple to adopt two sons. Edmonds claimed that Seelye was a childhood friend; however, this was not true.

==Later life==
In 1882, Edmonds began the process of clearing the charge of desertion from Thompson&#x27;s record in order to receive a pension. She wrote to several members of her Company, asking for them to sign affidavits on her behalf. In 1884, Congress declared that she was owed a pension of $12 a month. Thompson&#x27;s charge of desertion was cleared by Congress in 1886, and she received a discharge certificate from the Adjutant General&#x27;s Office in 1887.

Edmonds became a lecturer after her story received more publicity in 1883.

In 1897, she became the second of only two women admitted to the Grand Army of the Republic, the Civil War Union Army veterans&#x27; organization. She was a member of the George B. McClellan Post, No. 9 in Houston, Texas.

Edmonds died in La Porte, Texas, on September 5, 1898, from lingering complications of malaria she had contracted in 1863. She was only 56 years old. She was buried in the local cemetery, but Edmonds was laid to rest a second time in 1901 with full military honors. She is buried in the Grand Army of the Republic section of Washington Cemetery in Houston.

== Veracity of claims ==
As early as 1883, when asked by a newspaper reporter, &quot;Can that book be regarded as authentic?&quot; Edmonds responded, &quot;Not strictly so.&quot; By the 1960s, fraudulent aspects of her pension file were being discussed by historians. Edmonds&#x27; biographer, Sylvia Dannett, acknowledges lies told by Edmonds in her book &quot;She Rode with the Generals&quot;. Edwin Fishel writes that Edmonds &quot;almost certainly was never a spy&quot;, citing dubious claims in her memoirs as well as the absence of her name or alias among the papers of George B. McClellan, one of the Union generals in charge of Army intelligence, or in the roster of Allan Pinkerton&#x27;s agents employed as spies for the Union.

Dannett was also one of the few historians of the 20th century to accurately portray a woman that went into service with her biography on Edmonds. DeAnne Blanton argues that &quot;only since the early 1990s has the subject of women soldiers received renewed and serious scholarly attention.&quot; Patricia Wilde wrote in her dissertation that many memoirs of the period, including Edmonds, Belle Boyd, and Loreta Velasquez, were purposefully using sensational rhetoric. &quot;A kind of pathetic appeal, sensational rhetoric is the use of shocking, exciting, and thrilling language and/or subject matter for persuasive purposes.&quot; She argues that &quot;disenfranchised nineteenth-century women used sensational rhetoric to circumvent obstacles that prevented them from publicly discussing issues related to the American Civil War.&quot;

==Legacy==
A number of fictional accounts of her life were written for young adults in the 20th century, including Ann Rinaldi&#x27;s &quot;Girl in Blue&quot;. Rinaldi writes of Edmonds&#x27; life and how she came to be Franklin Thompson.

American author James J. Knights presented a fictionalized account of Edmonds&#x27; wartime experiences in his book &quot;Soldier Girl Blue&quot;, published in 2019.

Edmonds was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1992.

Edmonds is listed on the Canadian ACW Memorial at the Lost Villages Museum, Long Sault, Ontario.

<doc id="384028" wikidata="Q2362398" url="?curid=384028" title="Kuntilanak">
<text>The Kuntilanak (Indonesian name), also called Pontianak (Malay name), or Yakshi (in Hinduism/ Hindu mythology) is a mythological creature in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. It is similar to Langsuir in other Southeast Asia regions. The Kuntilanak usually takes the form of a pregnant woman who died during childbirth. Alternatively, it is often described as a vengeful female spirit. Another form of the Kuntilanak refers to the ghost or white lady of Southeast Asian folklore.

The Kuntilanak is often depicted as a long-haired woman dressed in white. She lures in unsuspecting men to incite fear and enact revenge. Signs that a Kuntilanak is nearby include the sound of an infant crying and the smell of a decaying corpse or the plumeria flower.

== Etymology ==
Kuntilanak or Pontianak is often described as an astral female spirit; another version of this figure is a woman spirit with long sharp fangs and fingernails. It is similar to the spirit of a woman unable to give birth while her stillborn child was inside her womb. This figure is mainly known to reside in the Kalimantan region containing the city of Pontianak.

The Pontianak can disguise herself using the appearance of a beautiful woman to lure her prey. In Malaysia, lore depicts them as &quot;vampiric&quot; blood-suckers that dissect through the internal organs of men.
The Pontianak is derived from myths and folktales, some of which are particularly popular in Kalimantan (Borneo). Being one of the most famous pieces of Indonesian folklore, it inspired the name of a capital city in the Western Kalimantan region, called Pontianak. The legend of the city of Pontianak holds that the city began as an old trading station, infested with ghosts until Syarif Abdurrahman Alkadrie and his army drove them away with cannon fire. He then constructed a mosque and a palace on the site. These buildings became the city and the seat of the Pontianak Sultanate. Holiday celebrations often include firing bamboo cannons to pay tribute to the Sultan.

==Physical appearance and behavior==

The Kuntilanak (Pontianak) is often depicted as a beautiful woman with pale skin, red eyes, and long black hair. She is often dressed in a blood-smeared white dress. The Kuntilanak is also described as changing into a more monstrous form when she captures her prey which is typically men or helpless people. Because she is bloodthirsty and has a carnivorous nature, a Pontianak can also appear as a beast or a ghost, resembling the Dracula vampire.

Pontianak only appears under the full moon and typically announces her presence with the cries of infants or feminine laughter. It is said that if the sounds are quiet, she is nearby, but if they are loud, she is far away. Some sources also state that a dog howling at night indicates that a Pontianak is present, but not too close; if the dog whines, then a Pontianak is near. Its presence is also said to be heralded by a floral fragrance, identifiable as that of the Plumeria flower, followed by a stench similar to that of a decaying corpse.

The Pontianak kills her victims by using her long fingernails to physically remove their internal organs to be eaten. In cases where the Pontianak desires revenge and retribution against a man, it is said to eviscerate the victim with its hands. If a victim has their eyes open when a Pontianak is near, she will suck them out of their head. The Pontianak is said to locate her prey by the scent of their clean laundry; because of this, some Malaysians refuse to leave any piece of clothing outside their house overnight.

The Pontianak is associated with banana trees, and her spirit is said to reside in them during the day. According to folklore, a Pontianak can be fought off by driving a nail into the hole on the nape of her neck, which causes her to turn into a beautiful woman and a good wife until the nail is removed.

The Indonesian Kuntilanak is similar to the Pontianak in Malaysia, but commonly takes the form of a bird and sucks the blood of virgins and young women. The bird, which makes a &quot;Ke-ke-ke&quot; sound as it flies, may be sent through black magic to make a woman fall ill; the characteristic symptom being vaginal bleeding. When a man approaches her in her female form, the Kuntilanak suddenly turns and reveals that her back is hollow, much like the Sundel bolong the prostitute ghost with her large gaping hole on her back. A Kuntilanak can be subdued by plunging a sharp nail into the top of her head.

==In popular culture==
The Kuntilanak has been portrayed in Indonesian and Malaysian horror films and on Indonesian and Malaysian television.

<text>Pedro Páez Jaramillo, S.J. (; 1564 – 20 May 1622) was a Spanish Jesuit missionary in Ethiopia. Páez is considered by many experts on Ethiopia to be the most effective Catholic missionary in Ethiopia. He is believed to be the first European to see and describe the source of the Blue Nile, which he reached on 21 April 1618.

Páez&#x27; two-volume (History of Ethiopia) is regarded by scholars of Ethiopian history as one of the most valuable and accurate works on the contemporary Solomonic Empire and its history (as understood by local sources) up to his own time, particularly as the works of local writers, despite the Ethiopian Orthodox Church&#x27;s long tradition of literate monastic scholarship and the regular compilation of imperial chronicles, have in large part been lost in the centuries of intermittent conflict that followed or otherwise remained unknown to contemporary scholarship.

== Life ==
Páez was born in 1564 in the village of Olmeda de la Cebolla (now Olmeda de las Fuentes), near Madrid, which until August of that year had been a hamlet of the city of Alcalá de Henares. He was born sixteen years before the union of the Spanish and the Portuguese crowns (1580-1640); that union would determine the span of Páez&#x27;s missionary activity. In his youth, he studied at the Jesuit college in Belmonte, Cuenca. He was long thought to have then proceeded to study in the University of Coimbra, but recent studies have shown that he did his higher studies at the University of Alcalá. Around that time, he entered the Society of Jesus and was later ordained a priest.

In keeping with his religious vows as a Jesuit, Paez offered himself up for service in the East Indies, and in 1588 was sent to Goa (then part of Portuguese India), where he served at the College of St. Paul operated by the Jesuits in that city. The following year, a direct command of King Philip II of Spain was given for some Jesuits to go to Ethiopia to make contact with the surviving members of a Jesuit mission there, as well as exploring the possible union of the Ethiopian Church with the Catholic Church. With Antonio de Montserrat in command, the two set out for Ethiopia. Upon arrival in Yemen, however, the pair were betrayed by the native officer who had been entrusted with accompanying them on the mission. Handed from one local chieftain to another, they were held captive for nearly seven years, from 1590 to 1596, during which he learned Arabic. During this period he had to travel through the Hadramaut and Rub &#x27;al Khali deserts, and tasted coffee in Mocha, being one of the first European to undergo such experiences since Pero da Covilhã in 1488 or Francisco Alvares in 1562. The pair were finally ransomed by the Jesuits in Goa and returned to that city, where they spent some time recuperating from their ordeal. Unfortunately Monserrat never recovered, dying in 1600.

Upon his own recovery, Paez again set out on the mission. He finally arrived at Massawa in 1603, and proceeded to Debarwa where he met the chief of the Portuguese in Ethiopia, John Gabriel, on 11 May, and four days later had made his way to Fremona, the Jesuit base in Ethiopia. Unlike his predecessor, Andre de Oviedo, Paul Henze describes him as &quot;gentle, learned, considerate of the feelings of others&quot;. When summoned to the court of the young Emperor (negusä nägäst) Za Dengel, his knowledge of Amharic and Ge&#x27;ez, as well as his knowledge of Ethiopian customs impressed the sovereign so much that Za Dengel decided to convert from the Coptic Church to the Roman—although Páez warned him not to announce his declaration too quickly. However, when Za Dengel proclaimed changes in the observance of the Sabbath, Páez retired to Fremona, and waited out the ensuing civil war that ended with the emperor&#x27;s death.

This caution benefited Páez when Susenyos I assumed the throne in 1607. Susenyos invited him to his court, where the two became friends. Susenyos made a grant of land to Páez on the peninsula of Gorgora on the north side of Lake Tana, where he built a new center for his fellow Jesuits, starting with a stone church, which was dedicated 16 January 1621.

Eventually Páez also converted Susenyos to Catholicism shortly before his own death in 1622. Some of the Catholic churches he designed are still standing, most importantly in the area of Bahir Dar and Gondar, which influenced Ethiopian architecture for the rest of the 17th century. Páez&#x27;s efforts did not achieve the long-term success that might have been expected because other Jesuits sent to the region afterwards used a rigid approach in their evangelizing methods which led to their expulsion from the territory in 1633.

==Writings==
Páez&#x27;s account of Ethiopia, &quot;História da Ethiópia&quot;, which he completed in 1620, was not published during his lifetime, although Manuel de Almeida borrowed extensively from it to compose his &quot;Historia de Etiopía a Alta ou Abassia&quot; decades later. After almost three centuries, Páez&#x27;s history was printed as Volumes II and III of Camillo Beccari&#x27;s &quot;Rerum Aethiopicarum Scriptores occidentales Inedtii&quot; (Rome, 1905–17). His work was published in 1945 at Porto in a new edition by Sanceau, Feio and Teixeira, &quot;Pêro Pais: História da Etiópia&quot;. In Spanish, his complete work was finally published in 2014 with the title &quot;Historia de Etiopía&quot;. &quot;História da Ethiópia&quot; has been translated to English by Christopher J. Tribe and published by The Hakluyt Society in 2011.

In addition to translating the Roman Catechism into Ge&#x27;ez, Páez is believed to be the author of the treatise &quot;De Abyssinorum erroribus&quot;.

<text>George Oliver Smith (April 9, 1911 – May 27, 1981) (known also by the pseudonym Wesley Long) was an American science fiction author. He is not to be confused with George H. Smith, another American science fiction author.

==Biography==
Smith was an active contributor to &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; during the Golden Age of Science Fiction of the 1940s. His collaboration with the magazine&#x27;s editor, John W. Campbell, Jr. was interrupted when Campbell&#x27;s first wife, Doña, left him in 1949 and married Smith.

Smith continued regularly publishing science fiction novels and stories until 1960. His output greatly diminished during the 1960s and 1970s when he had a job that required his undivided attention. He was awarded the First Fandom Hall of Fame award in 1980.

He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s fictional group of mystery solvers the Black Widowers.

==Writing career==
Smith wrote mainly about outer space, with such works as &quot;Operation Interstellar&quot; (1950), &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1959), and &quot;Troubled Star&quot; (1957).

He is remembered chiefly for his Venus Equilateral series of short stories about a communications station in outer space. Most of the stories were collected in &quot;Venus Equilateral&quot; (1947), which was later expanded with the remaining three stories as &quot;The Complete Venus Equilateral&quot; (1976).

His novel &quot;The Fourth &quot;R&quot;&quot; (1959) – re-published as &quot;The Brain Machine&quot; (1968) – was an examination of a child prodigy, a digression from his concern with outer space.

<text>Death, Deceit and Destiny Aboard the Orient Express is a 2000 thriller film about a group of international terrorists who, a few days before the start of the new millennium, lure a group of very rich celebrities and businesspeople on board the Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul in order to extort large sums of money from them. The screenplay for the movie was written by Peter Welbeck (aka Harry Alan Towers) and Peter Jobin. The film, which was directed by Mark Roper, starred Richard Grieco, Joanna Bukovska, Romina Mondello, Christoph Waltz, Sendhil Ramamurthy and Götz Otto.

==Plot==
When an anonymous benefactor invites a party of celebrities and business magnates to a New Year&#x27;s celebration aboard the Orient Express, it is the guests&#x27; greed which brings them all together. Apart from an enjoyable free trip on the luxury train, the businessmen among the passengers also expect to make a lucrative deal. However, just outside Paris the whole train is taken over by terrorists—without anybody noticing. Jack Chase (Richard Grieco), a young American actor who has also been invited, realizes that one of the waiters is missing but does not know that he has been killed together with all his colleagues.

Very soon the passengers sense that something is wrong. For example, a powerful jamming station on board the train ensures that they cannot contact the outside world via their mobile phones. Then, before dinner, they get to know their host: It is Tarik (Christoph Waltz), a well-known, internationally wanted Arab terrorist, who communicates with them via interactive television. Tarik announces the &quot;Fundamentalist Revolution&quot;, the &quot;victory of faith over corruption&quot;, and demands one tenth of each of his hostages&#x27; fortunes. Tarik himself is in fact on the train disguised as a cook, but no one has so far found out. The captives also learn that the terrorists have rigged the train with explosives: If the train slows, stops or passes the midnight hour the bombs are rigged to blow.

Predictably, the passengers try to do something about their predicament. While the businessmen ponder the question of whether to pay up or not, it is the women who take an active part in fighting the terrorists, most notably Nadia (Joanna Bukovska), a young Russian dancer who has fallen in love with Chase and who even saves his life when he is attacked by one of the thugs. The couple secretly climb on the roof of the train and succeed in finding some of the explosives. In the end, shortly before their arrival in Istanbul, the locomotive, with Tarik in it, is uncoupled from the rest of the train and blown to pieces by the bombs planted by the terrorist himself.

Although the film was released long before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the character of Tarik is a thinly disguised Osama bin Laden. There are also some minor but obvious parallels to the 1974 film &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, which is based on an Agatha Christie novel. These parallels almost exclusively concern the setting and the constellation of characters: There are no similarities whatsoever regarding the plot.

<text>In ancient Egyptian history, dynasties are series of rulers sharing a common origin. They are usually, but not always, traditionally divided into 33 pharaonic dynasties; these dynasties are commonly grouped by modern scholars into &quot;kingdoms&quot; and &quot;intermediate periods&quot;.

The first 30 divisions come from the 3rd century BC Egyptian priest Manetho, whose &quot;Aegyptaiaca&quot;, was probably written for a Greek-speaking Ptolemaic ruler of Egypt but survives only in fragments and summaries. The names of the last two, the short-lived Persian-ruled 31st Dynasty and the longer-lasting Ptolemaic Dynasty, are later coinings.

While widely used and useful, the system does have its shortcomings. Some dynasties only ruled part of Egypt and existed concurrently with other dynasties based in other cities. The 7th might not have existed at all, the 10th seems to be a continuation of the 9th, and there might have been one or several Upper Egyptian Dynasties before what is termed the 1st Dynasty.

<text>Eugenie Peterson (, ; 12 May 1899 – 25 April 2002), known as Indra Devi, was a pioneering teacher of yoga as exercise, and an early disciple of the &quot;father of modern yoga&quot;, Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. 

She went to India in her twenties, becoming a film star there and acquiring the stage name Indra Devi. She was the first woman to study under the yoga guru Krishnamacharya at the Mysore Palace, alongside B.K.S Iyengar and K. Pattabhi Jois who went on to become yoga gurus. Moving to China, she taught the first yoga classes in that country at the house of Soong Mei-ling, wife of Chiang Kai-shek.

Her popularization of yoga in America through her many celebrity pupils in Hollywood, and her books advocating yoga for stress relief, earned her the nickname &quot;first lady of yoga&quot;. Her biographer, Michelle Goldberg, wrote that Devi &quot;planted the seeds for the yoga boom of the 1990s&quot;.

==Early years==

Eugenie &quot;Zhenya&quot; Peterson was born on 12 May 1899 in Riga in the Russian Empire (now Latvia), to Vasili Peterson, a Swedish bank director, and Aleksandra Labunskaya, a Russian noblewoman who acted at the Nezlobina Theatre. Eugenie was given a Russian Orthodox baptism. She went to high school in Saint Petersburg, graduating with a gold medal in 1917. She briefly attended drama school in Moscow. In the Russian Revolution, her father served as an army officer and went missing in action in the civil war. Eugenie and her mother escaped to Latvia as the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917, losing the family fortune; in 1920 they moved to Poland, and in 1921 to Berlin, where she became an actress and dancer.

In 1926, attracted by a notice in a bookshop in Tallinn, she went to hear Jiddu Krishnamurti at a Theosophical Society meeting in the Netherlands; his chanting of Sanskrit mantras around a campfire had a powerful effect on her. She later said &quot;It seemed to me, I was hearing a forgotten call, familiar, but distant. From that day everything in me turned upside down.&quot;

==Career==

===India===

Devi&#x27;s fascination with India began at 15 when she read a book by poet-philosopher Rabindranath Tagore and a yoga instruction book by Yogi Ramacharaka. In Berlin, she worked as an actor in &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;, touring Europe, and accepted a proposal of marriage from the banker Herman Bolm, on condition she could first go to India; he agreed and paid for the trip. She set off on 17 November 1927, crossing India from south to north, wearing a sari for the first time, sitting on the floor and eating with her fingers. She came back three months later, a changed woman, speaking only of India, and returned Bolm&#x27;s engagement ring. She soon went back to India, selling her valuables to pay for the trip. At the Theosophical Society in Adyar (Madras, now Chennai), dancing &quot;an Indian temple dance&quot;, she met Jawaharlal Nehru, starting a long-term friendship, and the Indian film director Bhagwati Mishra, who gave her a part in &quot;Sher-e-Arab&quot; (Arabian Knight): the 1930 premiere made her a film star in India, under a new stage name, Indra Devi. In 1930, she married Jan Strakaty, a commercial attache to the Czechoslovak consulate in Bombay, and for some years lived as a society hostess there.

She became interested in yoga, Nepal&#x27;s prince Mussoorie showing her some asanas, and she was impressed by the yoga guru Krishnamacharya&#x27;s demonstration of apparently stopping his heart. She asked to study with him; in 1938, he reluctantly accepted her as a student after his employer, the Maharaja of Mysore, spoke on her behalf. She was obliged to keep to the strict vegetarian diet and the monastic hours, with lights out at 9pm. She was the first foreign woman among his students in the yogasala in the Mysore Palace, studying alongside B.K.S Iyengar and K. Pattabhi Jois who went on to become world-famous yoga teachers. When she was leaving India to follow her husband to China, Krishnamacharya asked her to work as a yoga teacher there.

===China===

In 1939, she held what are believed to be the first yoga classes in China and opened a school in Shanghai at the house of Soong Mei-ling, wife of the nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, and a yoga as exercise enthusiast. 
The classes began with 20 minutes of relaxation in shavasana, followed by bridge, shoulderstand, gentle backbends such as cobra pose, lotus position (including leaning right forward into Yogamudrasana), and headstand, against a wall for beginners. There were many Americans and Russians among her pupils; she also taught free classes in orphanages. More and more people began to call her Mataji, which means &quot;respected mother&quot;.

===India and China===

Her husband died unexpectedly in 1946, and Devi returned to India, arriving in Bombay as the British Raj was coming to an end. She was hosted by the maharajah of Tehri Garhwal at his palace in the Himalayas. She was hoping to stay in Kashmir to teach yoga in a centre to be run by the Cambodian monk Bellong Mahathera, but her mother called her back to Shanghai, where Devi&#x27;s house was being requisitioned by the army in the Chinese Civil War. Devi arrived there in time to sell many of her possessions before the house was taken over. She claimed later that she had wanted to return to India, but she obtained a United States visa, and sailed on the troopship USS &quot;General W. H. Gordon&quot; to San Francisco at the end of 1947.

===United States===

In California, assisted by her experience as a diplomat&#x27;s wife with a patrician manner and the natural confidence of the wealthy, she met the author and philosopher Aldous Huxley and Krishnamurti, giving her access to spiritually-inclined Americans; an especially valuable contact was the diet and health guru Paul Bragg, who advised film and stage stars. In 1948 she opened a yoga studio at 8806 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, the first in Los Angeles; she had a distinctive style and appearance, as she normally wore a sari. Her friends Magaña and Walt Baptiste opened a yoga school in San Francisco in 1952; she became godmother to their son Baron Baptiste, who went on to found Baron Baptiste Power Yoga.

Devi taught her own form of hatha yoga, with asanas (postures) and pranayama (breath control); she avoided spiritual teaching, which she preferred to leave to yoga gurus. Her teaching style was in Stefanie Syman&#x27;s words &quot;gentle and even relaxing&quot;. She was almost immediately successful in attracting leading stars, including men as well as women; Syman notes that &quot;she could charm the pants off men&quot;. Elliott Goldberg gives a different explanation for her success, attributing it to her packaging of yoga for women as a &quot;beauty secret, youth elixir, and health tonic&quot;. More generally, in his view, Devi saw yoga as a remedy for anxiety and stress, noting that this transformed yoga from something that dissolved the ego to something that strengthened it, because, he commented, Americans did want to change &quot;but not all that much&quot;. Devi&#x27;s advocacy of yoga for stress relief contributed, in Goldberg&#x27;s view, to the widespread acceptance of yoga in America, and earned her the nickname &quot;first lady of yoga&quot;.

She taught yoga to many celebrities including Greta Garbo, Eva Gabor, and Gloria Swanson. Also among her students were Ramon Novarro, Robert Ryan, Yul Brynner, Jennifer Jones, and the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who brought Iyengar to the West. 

Her books, including the 1953 &quot;Forever Young, Forever Healthy&quot; and the 1959 &quot;Yoga for Americans&quot; described a gentle, relaxing style of yoga using a small number of asanas, practised slowly. Devi&#x27;s biographer, Michelle Goldberg, describes &quot;Yoga for Americans&quot; as having &quot;a chipper, secular practicality perfectly calibrated for Eisenhower&#x27;s America.&quot; Devi introduced the book as of value to artists, &quot;businessmen and sportsmen, models and housewives&quot; and office workers. Menuhin wrote the foreword. The two books were &quot;an enormous success&quot;, and were translated into languages including French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish.

In 1953 Devi married the German anthroposophical physician Sigfrid Knauer. In the mid-1950s she was granted American citizenship and changed her legal name to Indra Devi. In 1960 she visited the USSR, seeing Saint Petersburg (then Leningrad) for the first time in 40 years, and meeting the government ministers Andrei Gromyko and Alexei Kosygin at the Indian ambassador&#x27;s reception at the Sovetskaya Hotel. Devi later recorded several instructional talks on yoga, including &quot;Renew Your Life with Yoga.&quot;

===Latin America===

In 1961, Knauer bought Devi a large ranch near Tecate in Mexico; she opened the Indra Devi Foundation there. From 1966, she became close to the Hindu guru Sathya Sai Baba, and she travelled often from Tecate to Bangalore and Puttaparthi. She closed the Tecate operation in 1977 and moved with her very ill husband to Bangalore. In 1984 she and Knauer made a trip to Sri Lanka, where he died.

In 1985 she moved to Argentina. In 1987 she was elected president of honour of the International Yoga Federation, and of the Latin American Union of Yoga under the presidency of Swami Maitreyananda at Montevideo, Uruguay. She died in Buenos Aires in 2002.

==Legacy==

Biographer Michelle Goldberg comments that for most of her life, Devi&#x27;s &quot;only goal&quot; was to bring yoga to the West, and when it became &quot;a ubiquitous part of cosmopolitan urban culture, signifier of a lifestyle at once wholesome and sexy&quot; in the 1990s, she had certainly succeeded, even if the new yoga is &quot;much more vigorous than the style she taught&quot;. 

Yoga remains, Goldberg writes, as Devi had made it, a predominantly female pursuit, despite the energetic workouts of Power Yoga; she created the link in the Western mind between yoga and organic food, &quot;holistic spas, and biodynamic beauty products&quot;. Goldberg also notes that yoga in the West is &quot;a hybrid culture&quot;, with &quot;an immense gulf between the limber young women in Lululemon yoga gear ... and the ash-smeared half-naked yogins .. on the banks of the Ganges&quot;.

<text>Madhu Sudan (born 12 September 1966) is an Indian-American computer scientist. He has been a Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences since 2015.

==Career==
He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science from IIT Delhi in 1987 and his doctoral degree in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley in 1992. The dissertation he wrote at the University of California, Berkeley is titled &quot;Efficient Checking of Polynomials and Proofs and the Hardness of Approximation Problems&quot;. He was a research staff member at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York from 1992 to 1997 and became a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) after that. From 2009 to 2015 he was a permanent researcher at Microsoft Research New England before joining the Harvard University faculty in 2015.

==Research contribution and awards==
In 1998, he received the Sloan Research Fellowship. He was awarded the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize at the 24th International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 2002. The prize recognizes outstanding work in the mathematical aspects of computer science. Sudan was honored for his work in advancing the theory of probabilistically checkable proofs—a way to recast a mathematical proof in computer language for additional checks on its validity—and developing error-correcting codes. For the same work, he received the ACM&#x27;s Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation Award in 1993 and the Gödel Prize in 2001 and was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1998. He is a Fellow of the ACM (2008). In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. In 2014 he won the Infosys Prize in the mathematical sciences.
In 2017 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.
In 2021, he was awarded the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal for 2022.

Sudan has made important contributions to several areas of theoretical computer science, including probabilistically checkable proofs, non-approximability of optimization problems, list decoding, and error-correcting codes.

<text>Moving Pictures is the eighth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on February 12, 1981, by Anthem Records. After touring to support their previous album, &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; (1980), the band started to write and record new material in August 1980 with longtime co-producer Terry Brown. They continued to write songs with a more radio-friendly sound, featuring tighter and shorter song structures compared to their earlier albums.

&quot;Moving Pictures&quot; received a positive reception from contemporary and retrospective music critics and became an instant commercial success, reaching number one in Canada and number three in both the United States and the United Kingdom. It remains Rush&#x27;s highest-selling album in the United States, with five million copies sold. &quot;Limelight&quot;, &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Vital Signs&quot; were released as singles across 1981, and the instrumental &quot;YYZ&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Rush supported the album on tour from February to July 1981. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 379 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

== Background and recording ==
In June 1980, the band ended their 10-month tour of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom in support of their previous album, &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; (1980). The tour was a commercial success for the group, becoming the first of their career to earn them a profit. During their stop in New York City a month prior, the band decided to scrap plans for a second live album in favor of making a new one in the studio. Cliff Burnstein of Mercury Records suggested the idea to the band, and Neil Peart was particularly enthusiastic about the new ideas that were being developed at sound checks and was keen to put them to tape. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson caught on to his enthusiasm. The trio pitched the idea to their manager and producer, who had already mapped out a two-year plan for them, but agreed to the change and cancelled the schedule. Lifeson looked back on this change of plan as the most important one in the band&#x27;s history since the decision to record &quot;2112&quot; (1976), which became their breakthrough hit. Prior to starting on the album, Rush joined fellow Canadian rock band Max Webster to play on &quot;Battle Scar&quot;, a track for their album &quot;Universal Juveniles&quot; (1980). During the sessions their lyricist Pye Dubois suggested a song that he thought was suitable for Rush; this was developed into &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, the opening track on &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;.

The band retreated to Stony Lake, Ontario to write and arrange new material. The sessions were productive. &quot;The Camera Eye&quot; was the first song to be worked on; the track was quickly followed by &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, &quot;Red Barchetta&quot;, the instrumental &quot;YYZ&quot;, and &quot;Limelight&quot;. Lee noticed a change in Peart&#x27;s lyrics during this time, which had started with &quot;Permanent Waves&quot;, towards more concise and direct words. Following these sessions, Rush returned to Phase One Studios with their longtime co-producer Terry Brown and prepared demos of these songs. The tracks were refined even further during subsequent rehearsals for a series of warm-up shows across the US in September and October 1980, during which &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Limelight&quot; were performed live for the first time.

&quot;Moving Pictures&quot; was recorded at Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec in October and November 1980. The album was Brown&#x27;s first digitally-produced album. Rush wanted to preserve the quality of their recordings as much as possible by transferring finished sections onto a fresh piece of tape and placing the original copy in storage, thereby reducing potential damage to the tape from frequent playback. They experimented with a pressure zone microphone, a type of boundary microphone that picks up direct sound and no reverberated signals, that was taped onto Peart&#x27;s chest as he played the drums. The audio captured from it was used to pick up the ambience in the studio room and inserted into the final mix. Peart is seen wearing the microphone in the music video for &quot;Vital Signs&quot;. The album was finished three days behind schedule due to delays caused by equipment failure.

== Songs ==
===Side one===
&quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; features a backbeat in a time signature, along with instrumental and closing sections in . It was the first Rush recording for which Lee used his 1972 Fender Jazz Bass, which provided a punchier lower end than he had been able to obtain with his usual Rickenbacker 4001. The bass became Lee&#x27;s primary studio instrument from the recording of &quot;Counterparts&quot; (1993) onward. Lee said the group had more trouble with &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; than any other song on &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, and at times had doubts as to whether it would work. The band had technical difficulties with the computer that mixed the tracks, so they decided to manually operate the mixing desk with each member handling their own set of faders. Peart described it as &quot;an enjoyable work&quot; which took around a day and a half to record, &quot;collapsing afterwards with raw, red, aching hands and feet&quot;. Its instrumental section grew from what Lee would play on his synthesiser during sound checks on tour, which initially was forgotten about until the band traded ideas on what the section should be. It became one of the group&#x27;s best-known songs and a mainstay of subsequent live shows. The song was used as the opening music to the Brazilian dub of the spy TV show &quot;MacGyver&quot;.

Peart&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; were inspired by the short story &quot;A Nice Morning Drive&quot; by Richard S. Foster, originally written in the November 1973 edition of the American car magazine &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;. Lee described the tale as &quot;Orwellian in nature&quot; which deals with an individual taking their Barchetta on a fast ride despite the banning of high speeds and is chased after by hovering patrol cars for breaking the law. Instead of an MGB roadster as featured in the original story, Peart reported the Ferrari 166 MM Barchetta was the car that inspired the song&#x27;s title. In 2007, Foster and Peart met for the first time and shared their mutual interest of BMW motorcycles, which was documented in an article titled &quot;The Drummer, The Private Eye, and Me&quot;.

&quot;YYZ&quot; is an instrumental titled after the IATA airport code for Toronto Pearson International Airport; its rhythm is that of the letters &quot;YYZ&quot; in Morse code (). It stemmed from the band&#x27;s enjoyment of recording &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot;, a nine-minute instrumental on &quot;Hemispheres&quot; (1978); it was something they wanted to do again for &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, only shorter. The music originated while Lee and Peart were jamming as a warm-up, during which Lee came up with the main riff and Peart suggested to have a more mellow section with Lee playing keyboards. &quot;And then, almost out of nowhere, we had this song.&quot;

The lyrics for &quot;Limelight&quot; are autobiographical and based on Peart&#x27;s own dissatisfaction with fame and its intrusion into one&#x27;s personal life. The song contains two self-references: the first, the line &quot;living in a fish-eye lens, caught in the camera eye&quot; references the album&#x27;s following track, &quot;The Camera Eye&quot;, while the line &quot;all the world&#x27;s indeed a stage, and we are merely players&quot;, references the title of the band&#x27;s first live album &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot; (1976), itself taken from William Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy play &quot;As You Like It&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;The Camera Eye&quot; is a two-part track with sections unofficially titled &quot;New York City&quot; and &quot;London&quot;. Peart wrote the lyrics after taking walks in both cities, recalling observations and the rhythms he felt during them. It was the final song the band included on a studio album with a length of over ten minutes, something which was a frequent occurrence on their earlier albums. Its title refers to short pieces of the same name in the &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy of novels written by American writer John Dos Passos, which Peart admired. The opening of the track features an audio clip of a busy Metropolis city from Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; (1978)

&quot;Witch Hunt&quot; opens with faint voices which were recorded on the driveway Le Studio in sub-zero temperatures, with the band and studio staff shouting in a humorous way while drinking Scotch whisky. Lifeson said one of his lines, &quot;Fucking football&quot;, can be heard if the listener tries hard enough. The tracks were overdubbed multiple times until it sounded what Lee described as a &quot;vigilante mob&quot;. The main riff was written by cover designer Hugh Syme on a synthesizer and double-tracked drums in one verse. &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; would become a part of the &quot;Fear&quot; series of songs, which includes &quot;The Weapon&quot; from &quot;Signals&quot; (1982), &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; from &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; (1984), and &quot;Freeze&quot; from &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; (2002), and went on reverse chronological order by the album, except &quot;Freeze&quot;, which is the fourth part like normal chronological order.

&quot;Vital Signs&quot; was the last song that the band wrote for the album, which was pieced together at Le Studio. It features a sequencer part produced by an Oberheim OB-X synthesizer, and shows a distinct reggae flavour. Reggae influences in Rush&#x27;s music were first heard on &quot;Permanent Waves&quot;, and would later be heard more extensively on their next two albums.

== Artwork ==

The cover was designed by Hugh Syme who estimated the artwork cost $9,500 to produce. Anthem Records refused to cover the entire bill, leaving the band to pay for the rest. It is a triple entendre; the front depicts movers who are carrying pictures. On the side, people are shown crying because the pictures passing by are emotionally &quot;moving&quot;. Finally, the back cover has a film crew making a motion (moving) picture of the whole scene. It was photographed outside the Ontario Legislative Building at Queen&#x27;s Park, Toronto. The pictures that are being moved are the band&#x27;s Starman logo featured on the reverse cover of &quot;2112&quot; (1976), one of the &quot;Dogs Playing Poker&quot; paintings entitled &quot;A Friend in Need&quot;, and a painting that shows Joan of Arc being burned at the stake. The film crew on the back cover actually shot the scene, from which a single frame was used for the cover. This was revealed to Rush concertgoers several years later when the still image was shown on the stage projector which suddenly came to life as a film sequence.

Mike Dixon, one of the movers on the cover of &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; and the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Exit...Stage Left&quot; (1981), discussed the various people on the &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; cover. The first, Bobby King, seen furthest to the left, was a member of Syme&#x27;s design team and is credited for assisting Syme on &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;, &quot;Hemispheres&quot;, and &quot;Archives&quot;. Dixon explained that King is not only one of the movers, but also the Starman logo and the man in the hat on the &quot;Hemispheres&quot; cover. The mover holding the Starman painting is Kelly Jay, singer of the Toronto band Crowbar who performed a show with Rush in 1973. Photographer Deborah Samuel is the Joan of Arc character, and her relatives are the family on the right. However, this conflicts with information provided in the Rush biography &quot;Chemistry&quot;, which states: &quot;Hugh borrowed friends, neighbours and even his hairdresser&#x27;s parents&quot;.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Moving Pictures&quot; was played in its entirety during Lee&#x27;s visit to Rick Ringer&#x27;s radio show on CHUM-FM in Toronto, on February 11, 1981. The album was released on the following day.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine listed the album at among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has listed &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; at on the 2012 readers poll &#x27;Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time&#x27;, at on the 2015 list &#x27;50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time&#x27; (behind Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; at #1 and King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; at #2), and at on the 2020 edition of its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2014, readers of the &quot;Rhythm&quot; voted &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; the greatest drumming album in the history of progressive rock. &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; and &quot;2112&quot; (1976) are the two Rush albums listed in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

&quot;Moving Pictures&quot; was played live in its entirety for the first time to open the second set during each show of Rush&#x27;s 2010–11 Time Machine Tour.

In a knockout-style Facebook poll conducted in 2021, the album was voted the best album of the 1980s, narrowly beating out Depeche Mode&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Black Celebration&quot; to take the win with 52% of the vote. More than 22,100 votes were cast in the final round alone.

==Reissues==
The album was released on compact disc in 1984 by Mercury Records. Initial pressings were missing the first beat of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; by mistake but were corrected in subsequent releases. In 1997, Mercury Records released a digitally remastered version. The disc tray has a logo of three fingerprints with &quot;The Rush Remasters&quot; printed, a feature of all remastered albums from &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; through &quot;A Show of Hands&quot;, originally found on the cover of &quot;Retrospective II&quot;. The remaster restores all of the original artwork and lyrics found on the vinyl release (including the picture of Peart that had been left off of the original CD issue).

&quot;Moving Pictures&quot; was remastered twice in 2011. The first, by Andy VanDette, was for the &quot;Sector&quot; box sets which re-released all of Rush&#x27;s Mercury-era albums. It is included in the &quot;Sector 2&quot; box set. The second reissue was in April 2011, as a two-disc 30th-anniversary set. The first disc contains the standard stereo mix and the second, available as a DVD-Audio or Blu-ray disc, contains the album in a stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix with music videos of the three singles as bonus features.

In 2015, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; was remastered for vinyl as part of the &quot;12 Months of Rush&quot; promotion. The mastering was also made available in a 24-bit/48 kHz digital format on various high-resolution online music stores. These remasters have less dynamic range compression than the 1997 and 2011 versions. Sean Magee remastered the album from an analogue copy of the original digital master tape using a 192 kHz sample rate. However, as &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; was originally mixed on digital equipment at 16-bit/44.1 kHz, no audio above 22 kHz exists in the original master or any of the remasters, which explains why many digital music stores only sell the album with 48 kHz as the maximum available rate.

The band released a 40th anniversary edition of &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; on April 15, 2022. The five record set includes the 2015 remaster and a previously unreleased live recording of their show at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on March 25, 1981.

<doc id="384064" wikidata="Q606563" url="?curid=384064" title="Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act">
<text>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA or the [[Ted Kennedy|Kennedy]]–[[Nancy Kassebaum|Kassebaum]] Act&lt;ref name=&quot;Atchinson/Fox&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) is a United States Act of Congress enacted by the 104th United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on August 21, 1996. It aimed to alter the transfer of healthcare information, stipulated the guidelines by which personally identifiable information maintained by the healthcare and healthcare insurance industries should be protected from fraud and theft, and addressed some limitations on healthcare insurance coverage. It generally prohibits healthcare providers and businesses called covered entities from disclosing protected information to anyone other than a patient and the patient&#x27;s authorized representatives without their consent. The bill does not restrict patients from receiving information about themselves (with limited exceptions). Furthermore, it does not prohibit patients from voluntarily sharing their health information however they choose, nor does it require confidentiality where a patient discloses medical information to family members, friends, or other individuals not employees of a covered entity.

The act consists of five titles:

# Title I protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs.
# Title II, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers.
# Title III sets guidelines for pre-tax medical spending accounts.
# Title IV sets guidelines for group health plans.
# Title V governs company-owned life insurance policies.

==Titles==
There are five sections to the act, known as titles.

===Title I: Health Care Access, Portability, and Renewability===
Title I of HIPAA regulates the availability and breadth of group health plans and certain individual health insurance policies. It amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, Title I addresses the issue of &quot;job lock&quot;, which is the inability of an employee to leave their job because they would lose their health coverage. To combat the job lock issue, the Title protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families if they lose or change their jobs.

Title I requires the coverage of and limits restrictions that a group health plan can place on benefits for preexisting conditions. Group health plans may refuse to provide benefits in relation to preexisting conditions for either 12 months following enrollment in the plan or 18 months in the case of late enrollment. Title I allows individuals to reduce the exclusion period by the amount of time they have had &quot;creditable coverage&quot; before enrolling in the plan and after any &quot;significant breaks&quot; in coverage. &quot;Creditable coverage&quot; includes nearly all group and individual health plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. A &quot;significant break&quot; in coverage is defined as any 63-day period without any creditable coverage. Along with an exception, it allows employers to tie premiums or co-payments to tobacco use or body mass index (BMI).

Title I mandates that insurance providers issue policies without exclusions to individuals leaving group health plans, provided they have maintained continuous, creditable coverage (see above) exceeding 18 months, and renew individual policies for as long as they are offered or provide alternatives to discontinued plans for as long as the insurer stays in the market without exclusion regardless of health condition.

Some health care plans are exempted from Title I requirements, such as long-term health plans and limited-scope plans like dental or vision plans offered separately from the general health plan. However, if such benefits are part of the general health plan, then HIPAA still applies to such benefits. For example, if the new plan offers dental benefits, then creditable continuous coverage under the old health plan must be counted towards any of its exclusion periods for dental benefits.

An alternate method of calculating creditable continuous coverage is available to the health plan under Title I. 5 categories of health coverage can be considered separately, including dental and vision coverage. Anything not under those 5 categories must use the general calculation (e.g., the beneficiary may be counted with 18 months of general coverage but only 6 months of dental coverage because the beneficiary did not have a general health plan that covered dental until 6 months prior to the application date). Since limited-coverage plans are exempt from HIPAA requirements, the odd case exists in which the applicant to a general group health plan cannot obtain certificates of creditable continuous coverage for independent limited-scope plans, such as dental, to apply towards exclusion periods of the new plan that does include those coverages.

Hidden exclusion periods are invalid under Title I (e.g., &quot;The accident, to be covered, must have occurred while the beneficiary was covered under this exact same health insurance contract&quot;). Such clauses must not be acted upon by the health plan. Also, they must be re-written to comply with HIPAA.

===Title II: Preventing Health Care Fraud and Abuse; Administrative Simplification; Medical Liability Reform===
Title II of HIPAA establishes policies and procedures for maintaining the privacy and the security of individually identifiable health information, outlines numerous offenses relating to health care, and establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations. It also creates several programs to control fraud and abuse within the health care system. However, the most significant provisions of Title II are its Administrative Simplification rules. Title II requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to increase the efficiency of the health-care system by creating standards for the use and dissemination of health care information.

These rules apply to &quot;covered entities&quot; as defined by HIPAA and the HHS. Covered entities include health plans, health care clearinghouses (e.g., billing services and community health information systems), and health care providers that transmit health care data in a way regulated by HIPAA.

Per the requirements of Title II, the HHS has promulgated five rules regarding Administrative Simplification: the Privacy Rule, the Transactions and Code Sets Rule, the Security Rule, the Unique Identifiers Rule, and the Enforcement Rule.

====Privacy Rule====

The HIPAA Privacy Rule is composed of national regulations for the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) in healthcare treatment, payment and operations by &quot;covered entities&quot; (generally, health care clearinghouses, employer-sponsored health plans, health insurers, and medical service providers that engage in certain transactions).

The Privacy Rule came into effect on April 14, 2003, with a one-year extension for certain &quot;small plans&quot;. By regulation, the HHS extended the HIPAA privacy rule to independent contractors of covered entities who fit within the definition of &quot;business associates&quot;. PHI is any information that is held by a covered entity regarding health status, provision of health care, or health care payment that can be linked to any individual. This includes any part of an individual&#x27;s medical record or payment history. Covered entities must disclose PHI to the individual within 30 days upon request. They must also disclose PHI when required to do so by law, such as reporting suspected child abuse to state child welfare agencies.

Covered entities may disclose protected health information to law enforcement officials for law enforcement purposes as required by law (including court orders, court-ordered warrants, and subpoenas) and administrative requests or to identify or locate a suspect, a fugitive, a material witness, or a missing person.

A covered entity may disclose PHI to certain parties to facilitate treatment, payment, or health care operations without a patient&#x27;s express written authorization. Any other disclosures of PHI require the covered entity to obtain written authorization from the individual for disclosure. In any case, when a covered entity discloses any PHI, it must make a reasonable effort to disclose only the minimum necessary information required to achieve its purpose.

The Privacy Rule gives individuals the right to request that a covered entity correct any inaccurate PHI. It also requires covered entities to take reasonable steps on ensuring the confidentiality of communications with individuals. For example, an individual can ask to be called at their work number instead of home or cell phone numbers.

The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of the use of their PHI. Covered entities must also keep track of disclosures of PHI and document privacy policies and procedures. They must appoint a Privacy Official and a contact person responsible for receiving complaints and train all members of their workforce in procedures regarding PHI.

Individuals who believe that the Privacy Rule is not being upheld can file a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR). In 2006, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the OCR had a long backlog and ignored most complaints. &quot;Complaints of privacy violations have been piling up at the Department of Health and Human Services. Between April of 2003 and November 2006, the agency fielded 23,886 complaints related to medical-privacy rules, but it has not yet taken any enforcement actions against hospitals, doctors, insurers or anyone else for rule violations. A spokesman for the agency says it has closed three-quarters of the complaints, typically because it found no violation or after it provided informal guidance to the parties involved.&quot; However, in July 2011, the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed to pay $865,500 in a settlement regarding potential HIPAA violations. An HHS Office for Civil Rights investigation showed that from 2005 to 2008, unauthorized employees repeatedly and without legitimate cause looked at the electronic protected health information of numerous UCLAHS patients.

It is a misconception that the Privacy Rule creates a right for any individual to refuse to disclose any health information (such as chronic conditions or immunization records) if requested by an employer or business. HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements merely place restrictions on disclosure by covered entities and their business associates without the consent of the individual whose records are being requested; they do not place any restrictions upon requesting health information directly from the subject of that information.

=====2013 Final Omnibus Rule update=====
In January 2013, HIPAA was updated via the Final Omnibus Rule. The updates included changes to the Security Rule and Breach Notification portions of the HITECH Act. The most significant changes related to the expansion of requirements to include business associates, where only covered entities had originally been held to uphold these sections of the law.

In addition, the definition of &quot;significant harm&quot; to an individual in the analysis of a breach was updated to provide more scrutiny to covered entities with the intent of disclosing unreported breaches. Previously, an organization needed proof that harm had occurred, whereas now organizations must prove that harm had not occurred.

Protection of PHI was changed from indefinite to 50 years after death. More severe penalties for violation of PHI privacy requirements were also approved.

The HIPAA Privacy rule may be waived during disasters. Limited waivers have been issued in cases such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017.

======HITECH Act: privacy requirements======
See the Privacy section of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act).

===== Right to access one&#x27;s PHI =====
The Privacy Rule requires medical providers to give individuals access to their PHI. After an individual requests information in writing (typically using the provider&#x27;s form for this purpose), a provider has up to 30 days to provide a copy of the information to the individual. An individual may request the information in electronic form or hard copy, and the provider is obligated to attempt to conform to the requested format. For providers using an electronic health record (EHR) system that is certified using CEHRT (Certified Electronic Health Record Technology) criteria, individuals must be allowed to obtain the PHI in electronic form. Providers are encouraged to provide the information expediently, especially in the case of electronic record requests.

Individuals have the broad right to access their health-related information, including medical records, notes, images, lab results, and insurance and billing information. Explicitly excluded are the private psychotherapy notes of a provider and information gathered by a provider to defend against a lawsuit.

Providers can charge a reasonable amount related to the cost of providing the copy. However, no charge is allowable when providing data electronically from a certified EHR using the &quot;view, download, and transfer&quot; feature required for certification. When delivered to the individual in electronic form, the individual may authorize delivery using either encrypted or unencrypted email, delivery using media (USB drive, CD, etc., which may involve a charge), direct messaging (a secure email technology in common use in the healthcare industry), or possibly other methods. When using unencrypted email, the individual must understand and accept the risks to privacy using this technology (the information may be intercepted and examined by others). Regardless of delivery technology, a provider must continue to fully secure the PHI while in their system and can deny the delivery method if it poses additional risk to PHI while in their system.

An individual may also request (in writing) that their PHI be delivered to a designated third party such as a family care provider or service used to collect or manage their records, such as a Personal Health Record application. For example, a patient can request in writing that her ob-gyn provider digitally transmit records of her latest prenatal visit to a pregnancy self-care app that she has on her mobile phone.

=====Disclosure to relatives=====
According to their interpretations of HIPAA, hospitals will not reveal information over the phone to relatives of admitted patients. This has, in some instances, impeded the location of missing persons. After the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 San Francisco crash, some hospitals were reluctant to disclose the identities of passengers that they were treating, making it difficult for Asiana and the relatives to locate them. In one instance, a man in Washington state was unable to obtain information about his injured mother.

Janlori Goldman, director of the advocacy group Health Privacy Project, said that some hospitals are being &quot;overcautious&quot; and misapplying the law, as reported by The New York Times. Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., interpreted a federal regulation that requires hospitals to allow patients to opt out of being included in the hospital directory as meaning that patients want to be kept out of the directory unless they specifically say otherwise. As a result, if a patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to choose to be included in the directory, relatives and friends might not be able to find them, Goldman said.

====Transactions and Code Sets Rule====
HIPAA was intended to make health care in the United States more efficient by standardizing health care transactions. To this end, HIPAA added a new Part C titled &quot;Administrative Simplification&quot; to Title XI of the Social Security Act, requiring all health plans to engage in health care transactions in a standardized way. 

The HIPAA/EDI (electronic data interchange) provision was scheduled to take effect from October 16, 2003, with a one-year extension for certain &quot;small plans&quot;. However, due to widespread confusion and difficulty in implementing the rule, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) granted a one-year extension to all parties. On January 1, 2012, newer versions, ASC X12 005010 and NCPDP D.0 came into effect, replacing the previous ASC X12 004010 and NCPDP 5.1 mandate. The ASC X12 005010 version provides a mechanism allowing the use of ICD-10-CM as well as other improvements.

HIPAA-covered health plans are now required to use standardized HIPAA electronic transactions (see 42 USC § 1320d-2 and 45 CFR Part 162). Information about this can be found in the final rule for HIPAA electronic transaction standards (74 Fed. Reg. 3296, published in the Federal Register on January 16, 2009), and on the CMS website.

The EDI Health Care Claim Transaction Set (837) is used to submit health care claim billing information, encounter information, or both, except for retail pharmacy claims (see EDI Retail Pharmacy Claim Transaction). It can be sent from providers of health care services to payers, either directly or via intermediary billers and claims clearinghouses. It can also be used to transmit health care claims and billing payment information between payers with different payment responsibilities where coordination of benefits is required or between payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or payment of health care services within a specific health care/insurance industry segment.

For example, a state mental health agency may mandate all health care claims, providers and health plans who trade professional (medical) health care claims electronically must use the 837 Health Care Claim professional standard to send in claims. As there are many different business applications for the health care claim, there can be slight derivations to cover specific institutions, professionals, chiropractors, dentists, etc.

EDI Retail Pharmacy Claim Transaction (NCPDP) Telecommunications is used to submit retail pharmacy claims to payers by health care professionals who dispense medications directly or via intermediary billers and claims clearinghouses. It can also be used to transmit claims for retail pharmacy services and billing payment information between payers with different payment responsibilities where coordination of benefits is required or between payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or payment of retail pharmacy services within the pharmacy health care/insurance industry segment.

The EDI Health Care Claim Payment/Advice Transaction Set (835) can be used to make a payment, send an Explanation of Benefits (EOB), send an Explanation of Payments (EOP) remittance advice, or make a payment and send an EOP remittance advice only from a health insurer to a health care provider either directly or via a financial institution.

The EDI Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance Set (834) can be used by employers, unions, government agencies, associations, or insurance agencies to enroll members to a payer. The payer is a healthcare organization that pays claims, administers insurance, or offers a benefit or product. Examples of payers include an insurance company, healthcare professional (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), government agency (Medicaid, Medicare etc.) or any organization that may be contracted by one of these former groups.

EDI Payroll Deducted, and another group, Premium Payment for Insurance Products (820), is a transaction set for making premium payments for insurance products. It can be used to order a financial institution to make a payment to a payee.

EDI Health Care Eligibility/Benefit Inquiry (270) is used to inquire about the health care benefits and eligibility associated with a subscriber or dependent.

EDI Health Care Eligibility/Benefit Response (271) is used to respond to a request inquiry about the health care benefits and eligibility associated with a subscriber or dependent.

EDI Health Care Claim Status Request (276) is a transaction set that can be used by a provider, recipient of health care products or services, or their authorized agent to request the status of a health care claim.

EDI Health Care Claim Status Notification (277) is a transaction set that can be used by a healthcare payer or authorized agent to notify a provider, recipient, or authorized agent regarding the status of a health care claim or encounter, or to request additional information from the provider regarding a health care claim or encounter. This transaction set is not intended to replace the Health Care Claim Payment/Advice Transaction Set (835) and is not used for account payment posting. The notification is at a summary or service line detail level. The notification may be solicited or unsolicited.

EDI Health Care Service Review Information (278) is a transaction set that can be used to transmit health care service information, such as subscriber, patient, demographic, diagnosis, or treatment data for the purpose of the request for review, certification, notification, or reporting the outcome of a health care services review.

EDI Functional Acknowledgement Transaction Set (997) is a transaction set that can be used to define the control structures for a set of acknowledgments to indicate the results of the syntactical analysis of the electronically encoded documents. Although not specifically named in the HIPAA Legislation or Final Rule, it&#x27;s necessary for X12 transaction set processing. The encoded documents are the transaction sets, sorted in functional groups, used in defining transactions for business data interchange. This standard doesn&#x27;t cover the semantic meaning of the information encoded in the transaction sets.

=====Brief 5010 Transactions and Code Sets Rules Update Summary=====
# Transaction Set (997) will be replaced by Transaction Set (999) &quot;acknowledgment report&quot;.

====Security Rule====
The Final Rule on Security Standards was issued on February 20, 2003. The Security Rule complements the Privacy Rule. While the Privacy Rule pertains to all Protected Health Information (PHI) including paper and electronic, the Security Rule deals specifically with Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI). It outlines three types of security safeguards required for compliance: administrative, physical, and technical. For each of these types, the Rule identifies various security standards, and for each standard, it names both required and addressable implementation specifications. Required specifications must be adopted and administered as dictated by the Rule. Addressable specifications are more flexible. Individual covered entities can evaluate their own situation and determine the best way to implement addressable specifications. Some privacy advocates have argued that this &quot;flexibility&quot; may provide too much latitude to covered entities. Software tools have been developed to assist covered entities in the risk analysis and remediation tracking.

The Security Rule standards and specifications are as follows:

Administrative Safeguards – policies and procedures designed to clearly show how the entity will comply with the act
* Covered entities (entities that must comply with HIPAA requirements) must adopt a written set of privacy procedures and designate a privacy officer to be responsible for developing and implementing all required policies and procedures.
* The policies and procedures must reference management oversight and organizational buy-in to comply with the documented security controls.
* Procedures should clearly identify employees or classes of employees with access to electronic protected health information (EPHI). Access to EPHI must be restricted to only those employees who need it to complete their job function.
* The procedures must address access authorization, establishment, modification, and termination.
* Entities must show that an appropriate ongoing training program regarding the handling of PHI is provided to employees performing health plan administrative functions.
* Covered entities that outsource some of their business processes to a third party must ensure that their vendors also have a framework in place to comply with HIPAA requirements. Companies typically gain this assurance through contract clauses stating that the vendor will meet the same data protection requirements that apply to the covered entity. Care must be taken to determine if the vendor further outsources any data handling functions to other vendors and monitor whether appropriate contracts and controls are in place.
* A contingency plan should be in place for responding to emergencies. Covered entities are responsible for backing up their data and having disaster recovery procedures in place. The plan should document data priority and failure analysis, testing activities, and change control procedures.
* Internal audits play a key role in HIPAA compliance by reviewing operations to identify potential security violations. Policies and procedures should specifically document the scope, frequency, and procedures of audits. Audits should be both routine and event-based.
* Procedures should document instructions for addressing and responding to security breaches identified either during the audit or the normal course of operations.
Physical Safeguards – controlling physical access to protect against inappropriate access to protected data
* Controls must govern the introduction and removal of hardware and software from the network. When equipment is retired, it must be disposed of properly to ensure that PHI is not compromised.
* Access to equipment containing health information should be carefully controlled and monitored.
* Access to hardware and software must be limited to properly authorized individuals.
* Required access controls include facility security plans, maintenance records, and visitor sign-in and escorts.
* Policies are required to address proper workstation use. Workstations should be removed from high traffic areas and monitor screens should not be in direct view of the public.
* If the covered entities utilize contractors or agents, they must be fully trained on their physical access responsibilities.
Technical Safeguards – controlling access to computer systems and enabling covered entities to protect communications containing PHI transmitted electronically over open networks from being intercepted by anyone other than the intended recipient.
* Information systems housing PHI must be protected from intrusion. When information flows over open networks, some form of encryption must be utilized. If closed systems/networks are utilized, existing access controls are considered sufficient and encryption is optional.
* Each covered entity is responsible for ensuring that the data within its systems has not been changed or erased in an unauthorized manner.
* Data corroboration, including checksums, double-keying, message authentication, and digital signature may be used to ensure data integrity.
* Covered entities must also authenticate entities with which they communicate. Authentication consists of corroborating that an entity is who it claims to be. Examples of corroboration include password systems, two- or three-way handshakes, telephone callbacks, and token systems.
* Covered entities must make documentation of their HIPAA practices available to the government to determine compliance.
* In addition to policies and procedures and access records, information technology documentation should also include a written record of all configuration settings on the network&#x27;s components because these components are complex, configurable, and always changing.
* Documented risk analysis and risk management programs are required. Covered entities must carefully consider the risks of their operations as they implement systems to comply with the act. The requirement of risk analysis and risk management implies that the act&#x27;s security requirements are a minimum standard and places responsibility on covered entities to take all reasonable precautions necessary to prevent PHI from being used for non-health purposes.
====Unique Identifiers Rule (National Provider Identifier)====
HIPAA replaced various identifiers used by health plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs with an NPI. The NPI is unique and national, never re-used, and except for institutions, a provider usually can have only one. However, the NPI does not replace a provider&#x27;s DEA number, state license number, or tax identification number. The NPI is 10 digits (may be alphanumeric), with the last digit being a checksum. The NPI cannot contain any embedded intelligence; in other words, the NPI is simply a number that does not itself have any additional meaning. An institution may obtain multiple NPIs for different &quot;sub-parts&quot; such as a free-standing cancer center or rehab facility.

====Enforcement Rule====
On February 16, 2006, HHS issued the Final Rule regarding HIPAA enforcement. It became effective on March 16, 2006. The Enforcement Rule sets civil money penalties for violating HIPAA rules and establishes procedures for investigations and hearings for HIPAA violations. For many years there were few prosecutions for violations.

As of March 2013, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has investigated over 19,306 cases that have been resolved by requiring changes in privacy practice or by corrective action. If HHS determines noncompliance, entities must apply corrective measures. Complaints have been investigated against many different types of businesses, such as national pharmacy chains, major health care centers, insurance groups, hospital chains, and other small providers. There were 9,146 cases where the HHS investigation found that HIPAA was followed correctly. There were 44,118 cases that HHS did not find eligible cause for enforcement; for example, a violation that started before HIPAA started, cases withdrawn by the pursuer, or an activity that does not actually violate the Rules.

===Title III: Tax-related health provisions governing medical savings accounts===
Title III standardizes the amount that may be saved per person in a pre-tax medical savings account. Beginning in 1997, a medical savings account (&quot;MSA&quot;) became available to employees covered under an employer-sponsored high deductible plan, these being small employer and self-employed individuals.

===Title IV: Application and enforcement of group health insurance requirements===
Title IV specifies conditions for group health plans regarding coverage of persons with preexisting conditions, and modifies continuation of coverage requirements. It also clarifies continuation coverage requirements and includes COBRA clarification.

===Title V: Revenue offset governing tax deductions for employers===
Title V includes provisions related to company-owned life insurance for employers providing company-owned life insurance premiums, prohibiting the tax deduction of interest on life insurance loans, company endowments, or contracts related to the company. It also repeals the financial institution rule to interest allocation rules. Finally, it amends provisions of law relating to people who give up United States citizenship or permanent residence, expanding the expatriation tax to be assessed against those deemed to be giving up their U.S. status for tax reasons and making ex-citizens&#x27; names part of the public record through the creation of the Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate.

==Effects on research and clinical care==
The enactment of the Privacy and Security Rules caused major changes to how physicians and medical centers operate. The complex legalities and potentially stiff penalties associated with HIPAA, as well as the increase in paperwork and the cost of its implementation, were causes for concern among physicians and medical centers. An August 2006 article in the journal &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot; detailed some such concerns over the implementation and effects of HIPAA.

===Effects on research===
HIPAA restrictions on researchers have affected their ability to perform retrospective, chart-based research as well as their ability to prospectively evaluate patients by contacting them for follow-up. A study from the University of Michigan demonstrated that implementation of the HIPAA Privacy rule resulted in a drop from 96% to 34% in the proportion of follow-up surveys completed by study patients being followed after a heart attack. Another study, detailing the effects of HIPAA on recruitment for a study on cancer prevention, demonstrated that HIPAA-mandated changes led to a 73% decrease in patient accrual, a tripling of time spent recruiting patients, and a tripling of mean recruitment costs.

Under HIPAA, informed consent forms for research studies must document how protected health information will be kept private, potentially increasing barriers to participation.

These data suggest that HIPAA privacy rules may have negative effects on the cost and quality of medical research. Dr. Kim Eagle, professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan, was quoted in the &quot;Annals&quot; article as saying, &quot;Privacy is important, but research is also important for improving care. We hope that we will figure this out and do it right.&quot;

===Effects on clinical care===
The complexity of HIPAA, combined with potentially stiff penalties for violators, can lead physicians and medical centers to withhold information from those who may have a right to it. A review of the implementation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that health care providers were &quot;uncertain about their legal privacy responsibilities and often responded with an overly guarded approach to disclosing information ... than necessary to ensure compliance with the Privacy rule&quot;. Reports of this uncertainty continue.

Standardizing the handling and sharing of health information under HIPAA has contributed to a decrease in medical errors. Accurate and timely access to patient information ensures that healthcare providers make informed decisions, reducing the risk of errors related to incomplete or incorrect data. This standardization supports safer clinical practices and better patient outcomes. Furthermore, HIPAA grants patients the right to access their own health information, request amendments to their records, and obtain an accounting of disclosures. This empowers patients to be more involved in their healthcare decisions and ensures transparency in the handling of their information. 

===Costs of implementation===
In the period immediately before the enactment of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Acts, medical centers and medical practices were charged with complying with the new requirements. Many practices and centers turned to private consultants for compliance assistance.

===Education and training===
Education and training of healthcare providers is a requirement for correct implementation of both the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule.

Healthcare providers must receive initial training on HIPAA policies and procedures, including the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule. This training covers how to handle protected health information (PHI), patient rights, and the minimum necessary standard. Providers learn about the types of information that are protected under HIPAA, such as medical records, billing information and any other health information. They are also taught about patients&#x27; rights under HIPAA, such as the right to access their health records and request correction. Regular fresher training is recommended to keep healthcare providers up to date with any changes in HIPAA regulations and best practices. This includes updates on new policies, procedures, and any material changes to existing practices. 

== Misspelling as &quot;HIPPA&quot; ==

Although the acronym &quot;HIPAA&quot; matches the title of the 1996 Public Law 104-191, &quot;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act&quot;, HIPAA is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;HIPPA&quot;, variously said to refer to the &quot;Health Information Privacy and Portability Act&quot;, &quot;Health Information Privacy Protection Act&quot;, or &quot;Health Insurance Privacy and Protection Act&quot;. The &quot;HIPPA&quot; misspelling has been observed among COVID-19 scammers.

==Violations==
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, between April 2003 and January 2013, it received 91,000 complaints of HIPAA violations, in which 22,000 led to enforcement actions of varying kinds (from settlements to fines) and 521 led to referrals to the U.S. Department of Justice as criminal actions. Examples of significant breaches of protected information and other HIPAA violations include:
* The largest loss of data that affected 4.9 million people by Tricare Management of Virginia in 2011
* The largest fines of $5.5 million, levied against Memorial Healthcare Systems in 2017 for accessing confidential information of 115,143 patients and of $4.3 million levied against Cignet Health of Maryland in 2010 for ignoring patients&#x27; requests to obtain copies of their own records and repeated ignoring of federal officials&#x27; inquiries
* The first criminal indictment was lodged in 2011 against a Virginia physician who shared information with a patient&#x27;s employer &quot;under the false pretenses that the patient was a serious and imminent threat to the safety of the public, when in fact he knew that the patient was not such a threat.&quot;

According to Koczkodaj et al., 2018, the total number of individuals affected since October 2009 is 173,398,820.

The differences between civil and criminal penalties are summarized in the following table:
==Legislative information==
In 1994, President Clinton expressed his goals to improve the healthcare system. However, his reforms did not succeed, most likely due to a lack of support. The Congressional Quarterly Almanac of 1996 explains how two senators, Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Ted Kennedy (D-MA) came together and created a bill called the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995, more commonly known as the Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill. This bill was stalled despite making it out of the Senate. In the 1996 State of the Union address, Clinton pressed the issue, and it resulted in bipartisan cooperation. After much debate and negotiation, there was a shift in momentum once a compromise between Kennedy and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer was accepted following alterations to the original Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill. Soon after this, the bill was signed into law by President Clinton and was named the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

<text>AS-202 (also referred to as SA-202 or Apollo 2) was the second uncrewed, suborbital test flight of a production Block I Apollo command and service module launched with the Saturn IB launch vehicle. It was launched on August 25, 1966, and was the first flight which included the spacecraft guidance, navigation control system and fuel cells. The success of this flight enabled the Apollo program to judge the Block I spacecraft and Saturn IB ready to carry men into orbit on the next mission, AS-204.

==Objectives==
AS-202 was the third test flight of the Saturn IB, because a delay in the readiness of the Apollo spacecraft 011 pushed its launch past the July 1966 launch of AS-203. It was designed to test the rocket more than had been done on AS-201 by launching the rocket higher and having the flight lasting twice as long. It would also test the command and service module (CSM-011) by having the engine fire four times during the flight.

The flight was also designed to test the heat shield by subjecting it to 260 megajoules per square meter. Over the course of the reentry it generated equivalent energy needed to power Los Angeles for over one minute in 1966.

CSM-011 was basically a production model capable of carrying a crew. However it lacked the crew couches and some displays that would be included on later missions for the astronauts. This was the first flight of the guidance and navigation system as well as the fuel cell electrical system.

==Flight==
AS-202 was launched 25 August 1966 from Pad 34. The launch phase was perfectly nominal with the first stage burning for just under two and a half minutes, lifting the rocket to an altitude of , downrange from the launch pad. The second stage then burned for a further seven and a half minutes, putting the spacecraft into a ballistic trajectory. The CSM was separated from the rocket stage at an altitude of .

The CSM was preprogrammed to make four burns of its service propulsion system (SPS). The first occurred a couple of seconds after separation from the S-IVB second stage. It burned for 3 minutes, 35 seconds, lifting the spacecraft apogee to , downrange.

The second burn was 25 minutes later, lasting one minute 28 seconds. Ten seconds later, two more burns of three seconds each were done to test the rapid restart capabilities of the engine.

The command module entered the atmosphere at a speed of . The spacecraft performed a skip reentry, first descending to , then lifting back up to . By this time it had shed of speed. It then continued to descend. The main parachutes deployed at . It splashed down at 16.12° N - 168.9° E, from the target landing site, and the aircraft carrier took 8 hours and 30 minutes to reach the capsule (SouthEast of Wake Island).

==Staging footage==

AS-202 was one of three uncrewed Apollo missions which obtained notable close-up footage of a Saturn rocket during staging, the others being Apollo 4 and Apollo 6. Ejectable cameras were mounted to each launch vehicle, technology first developed for the Saturn I. On AS-202, a camera was mounted to the Saturn IB vehicle&#x27;s first stage, the S-IB, looking forward. It captured footage of the vehicle&#x27;s second stage, the S-IVB (200 series) pulling away and firing its single J-2 engine. The upper stage is identifiable by its firing of three ullage motors; a later iteration of the S-IVB, the 500 series, had only two ullage motors, and was that used on Saturn V launches.

Although the footage was captured during an uncrewed flight, it is frequently used as stock footage in documentaries of crewed flights, to illustrate staging. The footage was used in the documentary film &quot;Apollo 11&quot;, and is sometimes erroneously attributed to Apollo 11, or other crewed missions.

<text>Moving Pictures is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, published in 1990, the tenth book in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series. The book takes place on Discworld in Ankh-Morpork and a hill called &quot;Holy Wood&quot;.

==Plot==
The novel begins with the death of Deccan Ribobe, the last member of an ancient order tasked with &#x27;remembering&#x27; Holy Wood through ceremonial chanting, and the escape of an influence from Holy Wood Hill. Several months later, the alchemists of the Discworld have invented moving pictures. Many hopefuls are drawn by the siren call of Holy Wood, home of the fledgling &quot;clicks&quot; industry – among them Victor Tugelbend, a dropout from Ankh-Morpork&#x27;s Unseen University and Theda &quot;Ginger&quot; Withel, a girl &quot;from a little town you never ever heard of&quot;, and the Discworld&#x27;s most infamous salesman, Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, who introduces commerce to the equation and becomes a successful producer. The business of making movies grows rapidly, and eventually Victor and Ginger become real stars, thanks to the help of Gaspode the sentient dog (who also develops a manager-client relationship with Laddie, who everybody considers to be the real Wonder Dog, although in fact is very simple-minded). Holy Wood for a while becomes an effervescent place full of humans, dwarfs, alchemists, demons (which essentially constitute the main technological device to make movies), and trolls (among whom is Detritus) all living in harmony.

Meanwhile, it gradually becomes clear that the production of movies is having a deleterious effect on the structure of reality. After Victor discovers the body of Deccan and the ancient order&#x27;s record, Ginger is possessed by an unspecified entity and she and Victor find an ancient, hidden cinema, complete with a portal to the Dungeon Dimensions. Back in Ankh-Morpork, during the first screening of &quot;Blown Away&quot; (a parody of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;) which the senior wizards of the Unseen University are also attending, a creature from the Dungeon Dimensions breaks through. Victor fights it (in what eventually becomes a parody of the movie &quot;King Kong&quot; also featuring the Librarian of the Unseen University), having discovered that he could exploit Holy Wood magic and the narrative conventions of the clicks if he had a camera pointing at him. However, after the creature is defeated, Victor and the Librarian realise that the creatures will still try to get through from the Dungeon Dimensions and that Ginger in her possessed state was not trying to summon them but trying to keep them from coming through (possibly as a result of being descended from the High Priestess of Holy Wood). Returning to the ancient cinema at Holy Wood, Victor and Ginger witness a golden statue of a warrior (reminiscent of an Oscar) come to life and travel through the screen to defeat the creatures.

In the end most things return to normal (also because the Patrician and the wizards make it clear that they will not allow any more movies to be produced ever again), although dwarfs find themselves inexplicably singing &quot;Hihohiho&quot; while mining. Victor and Ginger have a last dialogue over the meaning of Holy Wood and being famous, and Gaspode and the other animals under the influence of Holy Wood lose their ability to reason and speak. The ending lines depict a poetic scene about the fragility of Holy Wood dreams.

<text>Radio New Zealand (), commonly known as RNZ or Radio NZ, is a New Zealand public-service radio broadcaster and Crown entity that was established under the Radio New Zealand Act 1995. It operates news and current-affairs network, RNZ National, and a classical-music and jazz network, RNZ Concert, with full government funding from NZ On Air. Since 2014, the organisation&#x27;s focus has been to transform RNZ from a radio broadcaster to a multimedia outlet, increasing its production of digital content in audio, video, and written forms.

The organisation plays a central role in New Zealand public broadcasting. The New Zealand Parliament fully funds its AM network, used in part for the broadcast of parliamentary proceedings. RNZ has a statutory role under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 to act as a &quot;lifeline utility&quot; in emergency situations. It is also responsible for an international service (known as RNZ Pacific); this is broadcast to the South Pacific in both English and Pacific languages through its Pacific shortwave service.

==History==

===Early years===

The first radio broadcast in New Zealand was made on 17 November 1921 by radio pioneer Professor Robert Jack. Government-funded public service radio in New Zealand was historically provided by the Radio Broadcasting Company between 1925 and 1931, the New Zealand Broadcasting Board between 1931 and 1936, the National Broadcasting Service between 1936 and 1962, the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation between 1962 and 1975, and the Radio New Zealand state-owned enterprise between 1975 and 1995. The organisation placed a strong emphasis on training its staff in Received Pronunciation, until it began promoting local and indigenous accents in the 1990s.

As part of the process of privatisation carried out by the fourth National government, the government&#x27;s commercial radio operations were sold to private investors as The Radio Network in 1996 and the government&#x27;s non-commercial assets (known previously as New Zealand Public Radio) became the current Radio New Zealand Crown entity.

RNZ had its headquarters in Broadcasting House in Bowen St, Wellington behind the parliamentary buildings. Construction of the Bowen St building began in 1959 and it was opened in 1963. In 1997 the building was demolished and RNZ moved to Radio New Zealand House on The Terrace.

===Later years===
The broadcaster is bound by the Charter and Operating Principles included in the Radio New Zealand Act, which is reviewed by the New Zealand Parliament every five years. The Radio New Zealand Amendment Act 2016 received Royal assent on 1 April 2016.

Purpose:

* As an independent public service broadcaster, the public radio company&#x27;s purpose is to serve the public interest.
* Freedom of thought and expression are foundations of democratic society and the public radio company as a public service broadcaster plays an essential role in exercising these freedoms.
* The public radio company fosters a sense of national identity by contributing to tolerance and understanding, reflecting and promoting ethnic, cultural, and artistic diversity and expression.
* The public radio company provides reliable, independent, and freely accessible news and information.

RNZ broadcasts over three nationwide networks; RNZ National, RNZ Concert and the AM network which relays Parliamentary proceedings. RNZ Pacific (formerly Radio New Zealand International or RNZI) is its overseas shortwave service, broadcasting to the South Pacific and beyond, while Radio New Zealand News provides comprehensive, up-to-the-minute news and current affairs information. RNZ also allows for the archiving of broadcast material of historical interest.

It must also produce, and commission high quality programming based on research of public needs, and balance mass appeal and minority appeal programming. In achieving these objectives, it must be socially and financially responsible.

===Proposed RNZ Concert closure===
In February 2020, it was announced by Music Content Director Willy Macalister and Chief Executive Paul Thompson that RNZ Concert was to undergo major changes: it would be moved from the FM to the AM band, streamed online and the current service replaced by an automated non-stop play format. Seventeen jobs would be lost from RNZ Music, including all the Concert presenters. It would be replaced on FM radio with music for a younger audience as part of a new multimedia music brand.

The move was widely condemned across New Zealand, with many people seeing it as a gutting of the arts in New Zealand. Former Prime Minister Helen Clark issued a statement on Twitter saying that it &quot;equates to a dumbing down of cultural life in NZ&quot;. Two thousand protesters signed a petition. The RNZ board reversed its decision when the government announced it would grant RNZ a third FM channel.

===Merger attempt===
On 23 June 2022, Broadcasting Minister Willie Jackson introduced draft legislation to formally merge public broadcasters Radio New Zealand and TVNZ into a new non-profit autonomous Crown entity called Aotearoa New Zealand Public Media (ANZPM), commencing 1 March 2023. Under the draft legislation, RNZ would become a subsidiary of the new entity, which would be funded through a mixture of government and commercial funding. The proposed ANZPM would be headed by a board and operate under a media charter outlining goals and responsibilities including editorial independence.

On 8 February 2023, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the merger of TVNZ and RNZ into ANZPM had been cancelled, stating that &quot;support for public media needs to be at a lower cost and without such significant structural change.&quot; He confirmed that both TVNZ and RNZ would receive additional government funding. Prior to the public media entity&#x27;s cancellation, the two public broadcasters had spent a total of NZ$1,023,701 on the merger process; with RNZ spending NZ$431,277 by mid-November 2022.

===Inappropriate editing of articles about international affairs===

On 9 June 2023, Radio New Zealand launched an investigation after discovering several stories that it said gave a false account of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Wire agency articles were said to have been &quot;edited to align with the Russian view of events.&quot; The editing was linked to one employee, journalist Michael Hall, who subsequently resigned. An RNZ audit identified 49 examples of what it called inappropriate editing on various international affairs. Nearly half related to the war in Ukraine, while others related to China, Israel and countries in Europe and South America. A Stuff reporter interpreted the edits to be broadly from a tankie point of view, in which aggression from authoritarian governments with a communist past are supported or downplayed, usually as part of opposition to the United States and its allies.

In early August 2023, the independent review found that Hall had breached both Radio New Zealand&#x27;s editorial standards and the company&#x27;s contract with Reuters. The review also criticised RNZ&#x27;s management for overreacting to coverage of Hall&#x27;s actions and found that internal cultural, system, and teamwork issues at contribute to Hall&#x27;s inappropriate edits. The review&#x27;s panel recommended that RNZ merge its digital news team with its main news team and appoint someone to focus on improving the organisation&#x27;s editorial standards. The RNZ board chairperson Jim Mather stated that RNZ accepted the report and would implement its recommendations.

==Radio services==
===RNZ National===
RNZ National, formerly National Radio, is RNZ&#x27;s independent news and current affairs platform and offers both its own on-air and online services and those from third party services. It includes the news and current affairs programmes &quot;Morning Report&quot;, &quot;Midday Report&quot; and &quot;Checkpoint&quot; as well as having news bulletins every hour. Its news service has specialist correspondents, overseas correspondents, reporters and a network of regional reporters. Magazine programmes include a broad range of contributors, interviews, music pieces and dramas, with reports and regular features in English and Māori. The network provides coverage of business, science, politics, philosophy, religion, rural affairs, sports and other topics.

RNZ National broadcasts on AM and FM via mono terrestrial transmitters based around New Zealand and the Optus satellite. It is also available on Sky Digital TV channel 421, Freeview satellite channel 50, and is available in stereo on the terrestrial Freeview HD service.

===RNZ Concert===
RNZ Concert is an FM radio network broadcasting classical and jazz music, as well as world music, specialist programmes and regular news updates. Founded in 1975 as the Concert Programme, the network was renamed Concert FM in the mid-1990s and assumed its current name in 2007 as part of a wider name change within Radio New Zealand to associate Concert FM with the RNZ brand. RNZ Concert was refreshed in February 2018, with several new programmes and presenters, and a renewed focus on live music and storytelling on New Zealand&#x27;s music and arts communities.

The station broadcasts in FM stereo via terrestrial transmitters located around New Zealand, as well as from the Optus satellite. It is also available on Sky Digital TV channel 422, and on Freeview&#x27;s satellite and terrestrial services on channel 51.

===AM Network===

The AM Network is a network of radio transmitters operated by RNZ, which broadcast all sittings of the New Zealand Parliament through a contract with the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Sitting hours are seasonal, and may be extended due to certain circumstances, but are generally 14:00 to 18:00 Tuesday and Wednesday, 14:00 to 17:00 Thursday and 19:00 to 22:00 Tuesday and Wednesday. AM Network Parliamentary coverage is also streamed online, with podcasts and transcripts available.

&quot;The House&quot; is broadcast on RNZ on the House sitting days at 6:55pm and Sunday at 7:30am and 10:45pm. It looks at legislation, issues and insights from Parliament.

To help fund the operation of the station, RNZ has leased the remaining hours to Christian broadcaster Rhema Media since 1997, which uses the frequencies to broadcast the low-budget easy listening Star network. The transmitters were previously used by the Concert Programme before it moved to FM broadcasting.

===RNZ Pacific===

The RNZ Pacific network (also known outside New Zealand as RNZ International, or RNZI) broadcasts on shortwave and via Digital Radio Mondiale to New Zealand&#x27;s neighbouring countries in the Pacific from transmitters located at Rangitaiki, near Taupō, in the North Island.
There also is a relay via WRN Broadcast and a livestream on the internet.

=== RNZ podcasts and series ===
RNZ has a wide variety of podcasts and series. Series can be downloaded in Oggcast format.

==RNZ News==

RNZ&#x27;s main news centres are located in Wellington and Auckland, with additional newsrooms in Whangārei, Hamilton, New Plymouth, Napier Hawkes Bay, Palmerston North, Nelson, Christchurch, and Dunedin. There is also a Parliamentary Press Gallery office situated in the Beehive in Wellington.

Before 1996, the News service provided news to all commercial stations operated by Radio New Zealand as well as many independently owned stations. New owner The Radio Network launched its own news service.

As well as on the hour news bulletins, the RNZ News service provides 24-hour programming and news and current affairs scheduled—programmes such as &quot;Morning Report with Ingrid Hipkiss and Corin Dann&quot;, &quot;Nine to Noon with Kathryn Ryan&quot; and &quot;Checkpoint with Lisa Owen.&quot;

==Websites==
The RNZ website, rnz.co.nz (formerly radionz.co.nz) was launched in October 2005 and includes news coverage, programme information, online station streaming and podcasting. RNZ National, RNZ Concert, AM Network coverage of Parliament, and RNZ Pacific are available as Windows Media Audio streams. Almost all RNZ-produced programmes are available back to January 2008, and have MP3 and Ogg Vorbis and download and podcasts options. Some material is not available due to insufficient copyright clearances.

The website was awarded the Qantas Media Award for Best Website Design in 2007, a New Zealand Open Source Award in 2008, New Zealand Radio Award for Best Radio Website in 2009, and ONYA awards for &quot;Best use of HTML and CSS&quot; and &quot;Best Accessibility&quot; in 2010. The site was re-launched on 26 May 2013 with a new design and a custom CMS built using the open source Ruby on Rails framework.

The website was further redesigned and relaunched in July 2016, and the domain was moved to rnz.co.nz in May 2019.

In July 2023, two news portals were opened for Chinese and Indian New Zealander community audiences, with the Chinese section featuring stories in Simplified Chinese.

===The Wireless===

In October 2013, Radio New Zealand launched the youth-focused and non-commercial website &#x27;The Wireless&#x27;. The website emerged from the push for a youth radio station as part of Radio New Zealand&#x27;s offerings. Instead of creating a youth radio station, RNZ decided to create a website or online magazine that focused on 18- to 30-year-olds which would be more relevant to the demographic.

Project manager Marcus Stickley noted that: &quot;RNZ has had the wisdom to recognize that it didn&#x27;t necessarily need to be under the RNZ brand. It needed to develop something specifically for that audience, and they&#x27;ve given us the freedom to go away and figure out exactly how to do that.&quot; The CEO of RNZ commented in April 2014 that The Wireless is &quot;the most exciting innovation from RNZ in recent years.&quot;

The Wireless ceased operating as an independent publication in 2018, and was folded back into RNZ.

===Tahi===
Tahi, a youth-oriented platform, was launched in December 2021.

==Former commercial stations==
Prior to 1996, Radio New Zealand operated a large number of commercial stations around New Zealand. These stations were typically local stations with their own local identity with the origin of many stations going back to the 1930s up until more recent stations created in the 1990s. Stations in the larger centres were usually local 24 hours a day, and stations in the smaller centres featured a mixture of part-local and part-networked programming.

In 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off all of their commercial stations to a syndicate that included United States radio company Clear Channel Communications and publisher Wilson &amp; Horton, in New Zealand the new owner became known as The Radio Network.

The following stations were previously owned by Radio New Zealand, some listed stations were closed down before the 1996 sale and Gore radio station Radio Hokonui was sold privately in 1994.

===Heritage Classic Hits and Newstalk ZB stations===
All of the early local radio stations started by Radio New Zealand originally broadcast on an AM frequency. FM broadcasting did not begin in New Zealand until the 1980s. In the 1980s and early 1990s, most stations listed below switched to an FM frequency but continued to broadcast on the original AM frequency. Some stations utilised the AM frequency for specialised shows such as local talkback, sports talk and local news shows. In 1993, the majority of these stations were split in two with the AM frequency used to broadcast Auckland based Newstalk ZB which was originally Auckland&#x27;s 1ZB. The local station on the FM frequency adopted a common format and brand called Classic Hits with all stations retaining local programming under Radio New Zealand&#x27;s operation.

===Community stations===
Radio New Zealand community stations operated in the heartland areas of New Zealand, typically these stations ran limited local programming such as a local breakfast show and at other times relayed a nearby station or relayed National Radio. Following the sale to The Radio Network most of these stations became part of the Community Radio Network with programming outside the breakfast show originating from Taupō. These stations later became part of the Classic Hits network in 2001.

Since the sale to The Radio Network ZM has been expanded to a nationwide network based in Auckland.

==Reception==
In August 2024, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that RNZ National&#x27;s overall cumulative audience had fallen from over 700,000 in early 2020 to 529,800 in 2024. During that period, RNZ&#x27;s flagship &quot;Morning Report&quot; show had declined from a cumulative audience of 500,000 in early 2020 to 376,500 in 2024. Meanwhile, commercial competitor Newstalk ZB&#x27;s breakfast show hosted by Mike Hosking had risen from under 400,000 to 445,300. In response, RNZ chief executive Paul Thompson said that RNZ had distributed its output across other platforms including its website, app, and podcasts, and also had content deals with over 65 partners. Thompson also said that RNZ had expanded its reach from 15% to 70% of the population over the past 15 years. He estimated that live radio now comprised 14% of its reach.

==Editorial independence==
, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated RNZ to be &quot;Independent State Funded and State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

<text>Nonpartisan democracy (also no-party democracy) is a system of representative government or organization such that universal and periodic elections take place without reference to political parties. Sometimes electioneering and even speaking about candidates may be discouraged, so as not to prejudice others&#x27; decisions or create a contentious atmosphere.

In many nations, the head of state is nonpartisan, even if the prime minister and parliament are chosen in partisan elections. Such heads of state are expected to remain neutral with regards to partisan politics. In a number of parliamentary or semi-presidential countries, some presidents are non-partisan, or receive cross-party support.

Nonpartisan systems may be de jure, meaning political parties are either outlawed entirely or legally prevented from participating in elections at certain levels of government, or de facto if no such laws exist and yet there are no political parties.

&quot;De facto&quot; nonpartisan systems are mostly situated in states and regions with small populations, such as in Micronesia, Tuvalu, and Palau, where organizing political parties is seen as unnecessary or impractical.

&quot;De jure&quot; nonpartisan systems exist in several Persian Gulf states, including Oman and Kuwait; the legislatures in these governments typically have advisory capacity only, as they may comment on laws proposed by the executive branch but are unable to create laws themselves. De jure nonpartisan national governments sometimes resemble one-party states, but governments of the latter type explicitly recognize a single political party of which all officials are required to be a member.

Unless there are legal restrictions on political parties, factions within nonpartisan governments may evolve into political parties. The United States initially did not have enfranchised political parties, but these evolved soon after independence.

==Comparison with other political systems==
A nonpartisan system differs from a one-party system in that the governing faction in a one-party system identifies itself as a party, where membership might provide benefits not available to non-members. A single-party government often requires government officials to be members of the party, features a complex party hierarchy as a key institution of government, forces citizens to agree to a partisan ideology, and may enforce its control over the government by making all other parties illegal. Members of a nonpartisan government may represent many different ideologies. Various communist nations such as China or Cuba are single-party nations although the Members of Parliament are not elected as party candidates.

A direct democracy can be considered nonpartisan since citizens vote on laws themselves rather than electing representatives. Direct democracy can be partisan, however, if factions are given rights or prerogatives that non-members do not have.

==Structures==

===Elections===
In nonpartisan elections, each candidate for office is eligible based on his or her own merits rather than as a member of a political party. No political affiliation (if one exists) is shown on the ballot next to a candidate. Generally, the winner is chosen from a runoff election where the candidates are the top two vote-getters from a primary election. In some elections the candidates might be members of a national party but do not run as party members for local office.

Nonpartisan elections are generally held for municipal and county offices, especially school boards, and are also common in the election of judges. In some nonpartisan elections it is common knowledge which candidates are members of and backed by which parties; in others, parties are almost wholly uninvolved and voters make choices with little or no regard to partisan considerations.

While nonpartisan democracies can allow for a wide selection of candidates (especially within a no-nomination system whereby voters can choose any non-restricted person in their area), such systems are compatible with indirect elections (such as for large geographical areas), whereby delegates may be chosen who in turn elect the representatives.

===Appointments===
Even if a government&#x27;s executive officer or legislature is partisan, appointments of cabinet members, judges, or directors of government agencies, may be nonpartisan. The intent of appointing government officials in a nonpartisan manner is to insure the officers can perform their duties free from partisan politics, and are chosen in a fair manner that does not adversely affect a political party. Twelve US states use the Missouri Plan, and two use a variation of it, to choose judges in a nonpartisan manner. Several countries with partisan parliaments use nonpartisan appointments to choose presidents.

===Legislatures===
In nonpartisan legislatures, there are no typically formal party alignments within the legislature; even if there are caucuses for specific issues. Alliances and caucuses with a nonpartisan body are often temporary and fluid since legislators who oppose each other on some issues may agree on other issues. Despite being nonpartisan, legislators typically have consistent and identifiable voting patterns. Decisions to investigate and enforce ethics violations by government officials are generally done on the basis of evidence instead of party affiliation. Committee chairs and other leaders within the legislature are often chosen for seniority and expertise, unlike the leaders in a partisan legislature who are often chosen because of loyalty to a party.

==Historical examples==
Democracy in ancient Athens was nonpartisan, as eligible citizens voted on laws themselves rather than electing representatives.

Elections to offices in the Roman Republic were all nonpartisan, though the informal factions of the Populares and Optimates did emerge within the Roman Senate.

===United States===
Historians have frequently interpreted Federalist No. 10 to imply that the Founding Fathers of the United States intended the government to be nonpartisan. James Madison defined a faction as &quot;a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.&quot; As political parties had interests which were adverse to the rights of citizens and to the general welfare of the nation, several Founding Fathers preferred a nonpartisan form of government.

The administration of George Washington and the first few sessions of the US Congress were nonpartisan. Factions within the early US government coalesced into the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties. The Era of Good Feelings, when the Federalist party collapsed (leaving the Democratic-Republican party as the sole political faction) was the United States&#x27; only experience with a one-party system.

The Confederate States of America had no political parties during its entire existence from 1861 to 1865. Despite political differences within the Confederacy, no national political parties were formed because they were seen as illegitimate. &quot;Anti-partyism became an article of political faith.&quot; Without a two-party system building alternative sets of national leaders, electoral protests tended to be narrowly state-based, &quot;negative, carping and petty&quot;. The 1863 mid-term elections became mere expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction. According to historian David M. Potter, this lack of a functioning two-party system caused &quot;real and direct damage&quot; to the Confederate war effort, since it prevented the formulation of any effective alternatives to the conduct of the war by the Davis administration.

Legislative elections in the Confederacy were decided without political parties. Key candidate identification related to adopting secession before or after Lincoln&#x27;s call for volunteers to retake Federal property. Previous party affiliation played a part in voter selection, predominantly secessionist Democrat or unionist Whig. There were no organized political parties, but elective offices were exempted from military duty. Virtually every position was contested with as many as twenty candidates for each office. The absence of political parties made individual roll call voting all the more important, as the Confederate &quot;freedom of roll-call voting [was] unprecedented in American legislative history.

The Republic of Texas was a nonpartisan democracy before it was annexed by the United States; all four presidents of the Republic of Texas, and the members of the Texian Congress, were officially non-partisan.

===New Zealand===
From 1853 to 1890, within the Self-governing colony of New Zealand, Members of Parliament were not organised into any formal political parties. Prime Ministers made individual agreements with Members of Parliament in order to form and maintain government, lest MP&#x27;s &#x27;cross the floor&#x27; and joined the opposition. 

=== Canada ===
The Non-Partisan League was an influential socialist political movement during the 1910s and 1920s in the United States, especially in the Upper Midwest, which also eventually bled over into the prairie provinces of Canada.

The League contributed much to the ideology of the former Progressive Party of Canada. It went into decline and merged with the Democratic Party of North Dakota in 1956. The Progressive Party of Canada and the United Farmers movement (which formed governments in the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario) also acted on a similar philosophy. In the case of the United Farmers of Ontario, while in power (1919–1923), the administration of Ernest Drury suffered much infighting as the result of conflicting views.

Because of their nonpartisan ideology, the Progressive Party of Canada refused to take the position of the official opposition after the election of 1921 when they came in second place. Four years later, they lost that position and their rural supporters began to move to the Liberal Party and CCF. Eventually the Progressive Party of Canada and the United Farmers movement faded into obscurity, with most of their members joining the Liberal Party of Canada and the democratic socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, or present day New Democratic Party).

==Modern examples==

===National governments===
Very few national governments are completely nonpartisan, but nonpartisan political systems at the national level are not unheard of, especially in states with small populations. Many national governments have nonpartisan offices even if their legislative branches are partisan. Constitutional monarchies have nonpartisan monarchs as their head of state. Parliamentary republics generally have nonpartisan, figurehead presidents.

==== Pacific Islands nations ====
Nonpartisan governments are much more likely in countries with small populations. Nauru, for example, has no political parties; its Parliament consists entirely of independent members of parliament or MPs, who form governing coalitions and opposition blocs through alliances of individuals.

In Niue, political parties have never played an important role. There is, at present, no political party, and candidates to elections therefore run as independents. The only party ever to have existed, the Niue People&#x27;s Party, disbanded in 2003.

In Tuvalu, where no political parties exist, &quot;MPs have very close links with their island constituencies and effort is directed towards balancing island representation in Cabinet&quot;.

Other nonpartisan island nations are the Pitcairn Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. These nations have small, highly dispersed populations.

Some states are &quot;de facto&quot; nonpartisan because while no law forbids the formation of political parties, the populations are small enough that they are considered impractical. Political allegiances depend mainly on family and island-related factors.

==== Muslim-majority countries ====
In Indonesia, all members of the Regional Representative Council, the upper house of the nation&#x27;s bicameral legislature, are barred to come from any elements of political parties.

The United Arab Emirates is a de jure nonpartisan authoritarian state since all political parties were outlawed. The Federal National Council (al-Majlis al-Watani al-Ittihadi) is the UAE&#x27;s parliamentary body and consists of 40 members, representing the Emirates, half appointed by the rulers of the constituent states and the other half elected to serve two-year terms, with only advisory tasks.

Political parties are also formally illegal in the Gulf state of Kuwait, as they have not been legalized since independence in 1961. Nonetheless, the constitution itself does not explicitly prohibit parties. Candidates for election to the National Assembly of Kuwait stand in a personal capacity. Nevertheless, several politically-focused organizations such as the National Democratic Alliance exist and function as &quot;de facto&quot; political parties.

Libya&#x27;s unicameral legislature, the General National Congress reserved 120 out of its 200 seats for independent politicians in multiple-member districts. The other 80 were elected through a party list system of proportional representation.

Oman does not allow political parties, and only holds elections with expanding suffrage for a consultative assembly. Though Oman is developing into a constitutional monarchy, political parties are presently forbidden in Oman. The previously influential opposition movement, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman, is dormant today.

In Saudi Arabia, there are neither national elections or legal political parties. Despite this, some opposition movements exist, with varying degrees of presence in Saudi Arabia and abroad.

==== Other nations ====
The Vatican State is a nonpartisan theocracy, though it does not have a native population and in essence exists as a sort of extraterritorial headquarters for the Catholic Church.

A nonpartisan democracy might take root in other sovereign nations, such as occurred in Uganda in 1986, whereby political parties were restricted by a constitutional referendum endorsed by the people of the country (this system did not have all of the features described above). During a subsequent referendum in 2005, over 92% of Ugandan citizens voted for the return of a multiple party system.

Until the mid-20th century, a Canadian politician&#x27;s political affiliation was not shown on ballots at any level of government. The expectation was that citizens would vote according to the merit of the candidate, but in practice, party allegiance played an important role. Beginning in 1974, the name of the candidate&#x27;s political party was shown on the ballot. 

In elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, political affiliation was not shown on ballots until 2004. For elections for the eighteen districts in the dependency, political affiliation was not shown until 2007.

===State or provincial governments===
There are several examples of nonpartisan state or provincial governments. The nonpartisan system is also used in many US states for the election of judges, district attorneys and other officials. Twelve US states use the Missouri Plan, and two use a variation of it, to choose judges in a nonpartisan manner.

The state of Nebraska in the United States has nonpartisan elections for its legislature because candidates are neither endorsed nor supported by political parties. However, its executive branch is elected on a partisan basis. It is the only state in the United States with a nonpartisan legislature.

Louisiana uses a nonpartisan blanket primary, also called a &quot;jungle primary&quot;, for state and local offices. In this system, all candidates run against each other regardless of party affiliation during the primary, and then the two most popular candidates run against each other even if they are members of the same party. This form of runoff election weakens political parties and transforms a partisan election into a partly nonpartisan election.

The Swiss Cantons of Glarus and Appenzell Innerrhoden are also nonpartisan, direct democracies; while they have a partisan parliament, all laws have to be passed by &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;, an assembly of all citizens eligible to vote.

Governors of Japanese prefectures are required by law not to be members of any political party.

=== Territorial governments ===
The territorial government of American Samoa is completely nonpartisan. It has 21 nonpartisan members elected by consensus to its Territorial House and 18 nonpartisan members elected to the Territorial Senate. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor are both nonpartisan offices. However, the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and its nonvoting member of the U.S. House are Democrats.

The British territory of Falkland Islands has a completely nonpartisan government in that no political parties operate on the islands. All eight members of the Legislative Assembly are nonpartisan, as is the Chief Executive and the Governor.

Guernsey has a nonpartisan legislature. The States of Guernsey, officially called the States of Deliberation, consists of 45 People&#x27;s Deputies, elected from multi- or single-member districts every four years.

Political parties played no official role in the Isle of Man before the 2006 elections and played a minor role in the 2006 elections. At the 2001 election for the House of Keys, the Manx Labour Party polled 17.3% of the vote and only 2 seats. The vast majority of seats at every election are won by independent candidates with no allegiance to any parties. However, several parties such as the Manx Labour Party and Liberal Vannin operate and hold a small number of elected officers.

Saint Helena, along with both Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha, does not have any active political parties, but no law forbids the formation of political parties; hence, the territory is a de facto non-partisan democracy. The Saint Helena Labour Party and Saint Helena Progressive Party existed until 1976.

The head of the territory and head of government of Hong Kong, the Chief Executive, is required by law not to be member of any political party. There are numerous political parties, but there is no legislation for political parties. Civil society organizations and trade unions also nominate candidates for election in Hong Kong under the system of functional constituencies.

The Canadian territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut have nonpartisan legislatures. The populace votes for individuals to represent it in the territorial assembly without reference to political parties. After the election, the assembly selects one of its number to form a government and act as premier. This system is in deference to the system of consensus government that predominates among the indigenous Inuit and other peoples of northern Canada.

===Municipal governments===

==== Canada ====
Unique among democratic nations with partisan elections at the federal level, almost all Canadian cities and counties (and similar levels of supralocal government) have governments elected on a nonpartisan basis. The municipal government of the City of Toronto, Ontario (Canada) is the fifth largest government in the country, governing a population of more than 2.7 million. It consists of a nonpartisan, directly elected council. The public may have a general idea of the candidates&#x27; political affiliations, but their parties have no official recognition or privilege in the functioning of City Council. Councilors are free to vote on each motion individually, not bound by party discipline.

==== Switzerland ====
Many municipalities in Switzerland also have a nonpartisan legislative assembly consisting of all citizens eligible to vote.

==== Scardale, New York ====
The Village of Scarsdale, New York selects its Board of Trustees using a nonpartisan system that dates back to 1911. Candidates for office are privately interviewed by a diversely composed committee and then nominated for office. New York State law mandates that these nominees must be democratically elected, however, nominated candidates are rarely contested in the general election. The coordinating Scarsdale Citizens&#x27; Non-Partisan Party motto is &quot;Performance, Not Politics&quot;

==== Philippines ====
In the Philippines, barangay elections (elections for positions in the barangay or village) are nonpartisan. The certificates of candidacies, which the candidates sign under oath, say that they are not a member of any political party. The nonpartisanism of barangay elections have been challenged lately, though, as some candidates are members of political parties.

Barangay Captains and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK, youth councils) chairmen in a municipality or city elect among themselves their representative to the local legislature. In deadlocked or hung legislatures, votes from the nominally nonpartisan representatives of barangay captains and SK chairmen hold the balance of power.

==Religious perspectives==

The Baháʼí Faith states that the partisan apparatus is not a necessary or beneficial aspect of democracy.

== Discrimination of non-partisan candidates in partisan democracies ==
In French parliament non-partisans are known as &quot;non-inscrits&quot; (unrecorded ones), and in some parliamentary talks they are given less time to speak.

<text>Health Level Seven, abbreviated to HL7, is a range of global standards for the transfer of clinical and administrative health data between applications with the aim to improve patient outcomes and health system performance. The HL7 standards focus on the application layer, which is &quot;layer 7&quot; in the Open Systems Interconnection model. The standards are produced by Health Level Seven International, an international standards organization, and are adopted by other standards issuing bodies such as American National Standards Institute and International Organization for Standardization. There are a range of primary standards that are commonly used across the industry, as well as secondary standards which are less frequently adopted.

== Purpose ==
Health organizations typically have many different computer systems used to process different patient administration or clinical tasks, such as billing, medication management, patient tracking, and documentation. All of these systems should communicate, or &quot;interface&quot;, with each other when they receive new information or when they wish to retrieve information. HL7 International specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which these healthcare systems can communicate with each other. The standards allow for easier &#x27;interoperability&#x27; of healthcare data as it is shared and processed uniformly and consistently by the different systems. This allows clinical and non-clinical data to be shared more easily, theoretically improving patient care and health system performance.

== Primary standards ==
HL7 International considers the following standards to be its primary standards – those standards that are most commonly used and implemented:
* Version 2.x Messaging Standard – an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions
* Version 3 Messaging Standard – an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions
* Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) – an exchange model for clinical documents, based on HL7 Version 3
* Continuity of Care Document (CCD) – a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA.
* Structured Product Labeling (SPL) – the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3
* Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) – an interoperability specification for the visual integration of user applications

Other HL7 standards/methodologies include:
* Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) – a standard for the exchange of resources 
* Arden Syntax – a grammar for representing medical conditions and recommendations as a Medical Logic Module (MLM)
* Claims Attachments – a Standard Healthcare Attachment to augment another healthcare transaction
* Functional Specification of Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Personal Health Record (PHR) systems – a standardized description of health and medical functions sought for or available in such software applications
* GELLO – a standard expression language used for clinical decision support

===HL7 Version 2===

The HL7 version 2 standard (also known as Pipehat) has the aim to support hospital workflows. It was originally created in 1989.

HL7 version 2 defines a series of electronic messages to support administrative, logistical, financial as well as clinical processes. Since 1987 the standard has been updated regularly, resulting in more than ten iterations. The v2.x standards are backward compatible, meaning a message based on version 2.3 will be understood by an application that supports version 2.6.

HL7 v2.x messages use a non-XML encoding syntax based on segments (lines) and one-character delimiters. Segments have composites (fields) separated by the composite delimiter. A composite can have sub-composites (components) separated by the sub-composite delimiter, and sub-composites can have sub-sub-composites (subcomponents) separated by the sub-sub-composite delimiter. The default delimiters are carriage return for the segment separator, vertical bar or pipe (codice_1) for the field separator, caret (codice_2) for the component separator, ampersand (codice_3) for the subcomponent separator, and number sign (#) for the default truncation separator. The tilde (codice_4) is the default repetition separator. Each segment starts with a 3-character string that identifies the segment type. Each segment of the message contains one specific category of information. Every message has codice_5 as its first segment, which includes a field that identifies the message type. The message type determines the expected segment types in the message. The segment types used in a particular message type are specified by the segment grammar notation used in the HL7 standards.

The following is an example of an admission message. codice_5 is the header segment, codice_7 the Patient Identity, codice_8 is the Patient Visit information, etc. The 5th field in the codice_7 segment is the patient&#x27;s name, in the order, family name, given name, second name (or their initials), suffix, etc. Depending on the HL7 V2.x standard version, more fields are available in the segment for additional patient information.

HL7 v2.x has allowed for the interoperability between the plethora of digital health systems, from Patient Administration Systems, to Electronic Health Records, and specialised Laboratory and Radiology Information Systems. Currently, the HL7 v2.x messaging standard is supported by every major health informatics vendor in the United States.

===HL7 Version 3===
The HL7 version 3 standard has the aim to support all healthcare workflows. Development of version 3 started around 1995, resulting in an initial standard publication in 2005. The v3 standard, as opposed to version 2, is based on a formal methodology (the HDF) and object-oriented principles.

RIM - ISO/HL7 21731

The Reference Information Model (RIM) is the cornerstone of the HL7 Version 3 development process and an essential part of the HL7 V3 development methodology. RIM expresses the data content needed in a specific clinical or administrative context and provides an explicit representation of the semantic and lexical connections that exist between the information carried in the fields of HL7 messages.

HL7 Development Framework - ISO/HL7 27931

The HL7 Version 3 Development Framework (HDF) is a continuously evolving process that seeks to develop specifications that facilitate interoperability between healthcare systems. The HL7 RIM, vocabulary specifications, and model-driven process of analysis and design combine to make HL7 Version 3 one methodology for the development of consensus-based standards for healthcare information systems interoperability. The HDF is the most current edition of the HL7 V3 development methodology.

The HDF not only documents messaging, but also the processes, tools, actors, rules, and artifacts relevant to the development of all HL7 standard specifications. Eventually, the HDF will encompass all of the HL7 standard specifications, including any new standards resulting from the analysis of electronic health record architectures and requirements.

HL7 specifications draw upon codes and vocabularies from a variety of sources. The V3 vocabulary work ensures that the systems implementing HL7 specifications have an unambiguous understanding of the code sources and code value domains they are using.

V3 Messaging

The HL7 version 3 messaging standard defines a series of Secure Text messages (called &quot;interactions&quot;) to support all healthcare workflows.

HL7 v3 messages are based on an XML encoding syntax, as shown in this example:
&lt;POLB_IN224200 ITSVersion=&quot;XML_1.0&quot; xmlns=&quot;urn:hl7-org:v3&quot;
 xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;

===Clinical Document Architecture===
The HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is an XML-based markup standard intended to specify the encoding, structure and semantics of clinical documents for exchange. The standard was jointly published with ISO as ISO/HL7 27932.

===Continuity of Care Document===

The Continuity of Care Document framework is a US-specific standard for the exchange of medical summaries, based on the Clinical Document Architecture standard.

===Structured Product Labeling===
Structured Product Labeling describes the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3.

===Clinical Context Object Workgroup===

CCOW, or &quot;Clinical Context Object Workgroup,&quot; is a standard protocol designed to enable disparate applications to share user context and patient context in real-time, and at the user-interface level. CCOW implementations typically require a CCOW vault system to manage user security between applications.

==Other standards and methods==

===Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)===

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources is a modern interoperability specification from HL7 International designed to be easier to implement, more open, and more extensible than HL7 versions 2.x or 3.x. It leverages a modern web-based suite of API technology, including a HTTP-based RESTful protocol, HTML and Cascading Style Sheets for user interface integration, a choice of JSON or XML for data representation, OAuth for authorization and Atom for query results. The main purpose of the FHIR standard is to ensure interoperability between different computer systems. It defines the data format and protocol for exchanging medical information, regardless of how it is stored in these systems.

===Services Aware Interoperability Framework===
The HL7 Services-Aware Enterprise Architecture Framework (SAIF) provides consistency between all HL7 artifacts, and enables a standardized approach to Enterprise Architecture (EA) development and implementation, and a way to measure the consistency.

SAIF is a way of thinking about producing specifications that explicitly describe the governance, conformance, compliance, and behavioral semantics that are needed to achieve computable semantic working interoperability. The intended information transmission technology might use a messaging, document exchange, or service approach.

SAIF is the framework that is required to rationalize interoperability of other standards. SAIF is an architecture for achieving interoperability, but it is not a whole-solution design for enterprise architecture management.

=== Arden syntax ===

The Arden syntax is a language for encoding medical knowledge. HL7 International adopted and oversees the standard beginning with Arden syntax 2.0. These Medical Logic Modules (MLMs) are used in the clinical setting as they can contain sufficient knowledge to make single medical decisions. They can produce alerts, diagnoses, and interpretations along with quality assurance function and administrative support. An MLM must run on a computer that meets the minimum system requirements and has the correct program installed. Then, the MLM can give advice for when and where it is needed.

===Clinical Quality Language===
Clinical Quality Language (CQL) is a ANSI certified clinically focused high-level expression language standard curated by Health Level 7. It is designated for clinical knowledge sharing in the domains of electronic clinical quality measurement and clinical decision support.

Clinical quality language is being used for a variety of clinical applications including WHO SMART guidelines where it is used for encoding decision logic and performance indicators. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services adopted CQL for clinical quality measure specifications since 2019.

CQL allows modular and flexible expression of logic and is both human-readable and machine processable.

An implementation of CQL was open sourced and published by the National Committee for Quality Assurance in 2023 with the aim of encouraging adoption of the language.

===MLLP===
A large portion of HL7 messaging is transported by Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP), also known as Lower Layer Protocol (LLP) or Minimum Layer Protocol (MLP). For transmitting via TCP/IP, header and trailer characters are added to the message to identify the beginning and ending of the message because TCP/IP is a continuous stream of bytes. Hybrid Lower Layer Protocol (HLLP) is a variation of MLLP that includes a checksum to help verify message integrity. Amongst other software vendors, MLLP is supported by Microsoft, Oracle, Cleo.

MLLP contains no inherent security or encryption but relies on lower layer protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IPsec for safeguarding Protected health information outside of a secure network.

===Functional EHR and PHR specifications===
Functional specifications for an electronic health record.

== Message details ==

===The OBR segment===
An OBR Segment carries information about an exam, diagnostic study/observation. It is a required segment in an ORM (order message) or an ORU (Observation Result) message.

<text>James Alexander Seddon (July 13, 1815 – August 19, 1880) was an American lawyer and politician who served two terms as a Representative in the United States Congress, as a member of the Democratic Party. Seddon was appointed Confederate States Secretary of War by Jefferson Davis during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Due to frail health, Seddon was educated primarily at home and became self-taught as a youth. At the age of twenty-one, he entered the law school of the University of Virginia. After graduation, Seddon settled in Richmond, Virginia, establishing a successful law practice.

In 1845, the Democratic Party nominated Seddon for Congress, and he was easily elected. He was renominated two years later but declined due to platform differences with the party. In 1849, Seddon was reelected to Congress, serving from December 1849 until March 1851. Owing to poor health, he declined another nomination at the end of his term. He retired to &quot;Sabot Hill,&quot; his plantation located along the James River above Richmond.

Seddon attended the Peace Conference of 1861 held in Washington, D.C., which attempted to devise a means of preventing the impending civil war. Later in the same year, he attended the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. President Davis named him his fourth Secretary of War, succeeding George W. Randolph. He held this post until January 1, 1865, when he retired from public life to his plantation and was succeeded by John C. Breckinridge. His service of more than twenty-four months as Secretary made him the most durable of the five secretaries.

==Electoral history==
*1845; Seddon was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 52.28% of the vote, defeating Whig John Minor Botts.
*1849; Seddon was reelected with 53.64% of the vote, defeating Whig challenger Botts.

<text>Jack Daniel&#x27;s is a brand of Tennessee whiskey produced at Jack Daniel Distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee, which has been owned by the Brown–Forman Corporation since 1956.

Packaged in square bottles, Jack Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Black Label&quot; Tennessee whiskey sold 12.9 million nine-liter cases in 2017. Other brand variations, such as Tennessee Honey, Tennessee Apple, Gentleman Jack, Tennessee Fire, and ready to drink (RTD) products brought the total to more than 16.1 million equivalent adjusted cases for the entire Jack Daniel&#x27;s family of brands.

== Early life of Jasper Daniel ==
The Jack Daniel&#x27;s brand&#x27;s official website suggests that its founder, Jasper Newton &quot;Jack&quot; Daniel, was born in 1850 (his tombstone bears that date), but says his exact birth date is unknown. The company website says it is customary to celebrate his birthday in September. According to the Tennessee state library website in 2013, records list his birth date as September 5, 1846. It maintains that the 1850 birth date seems impossible since his mother died in 1847. In the 2004 biography &quot;Blood &amp; Whiskey: The Life and Times of Jack Daniel&quot;, author Peter Krass said his investigation showed that Daniel was born in January 1849 (based on Jack&#x27;s sister&#x27;s diary, census records, and the date of death of Jack&#x27;s mother).

Jack was the youngest of 10 children born to his mother, Lucinda (Cook) Daniel, and father Calaway Daniel. After Lucinda&#x27;s death, his father remarried and had three more children. Calaway Daniel&#x27;s father, Joseph &quot;Job&quot; Daniel, had emigrated from Wales to the United States with his Scottish wife, the former Elizabeth Calaway. Jack Daniel&#x27;s ancestry included English, and Scots-Irish as well.

Jack did not get along with his stepmother. After Daniel&#x27;s father died in the Civil War, the boy was legally adopted by a family friend named Felix Waggoner, but was soon taken in by another local farmer named Dan Call.

== Career of Jasper Daniel ==
As a teenager, Daniel was taken in by Dan Call, a local lay preacher and moonshine distiller. He began learning the distilling trade from Call and his Master Distiller, Nathan &quot;Nearest&quot; Green, an enslaved African-American man. Green was known to specialize in the Lincoln County Process, a distilling process that filters the whiskey through sugar maple charcoal. This process created the distinction between bourbon and the Tennessee whiskey known today. While under Green as an apprentice, Daniel was taught the Lincoln County Process. Green continued to work with Call after emancipation.

In 1875, on receiving an inheritance from his father&#x27;s estate (following a long dispute with his siblings), Daniel founded a legally registered distilling business with Call. He took over the distillery shortly afterward when Call quit for religious reasons. The brand label on the product says &quot;Est. &amp; Reg. in 1866&quot;, but his biographer has cited official registration documents, asserting that the business was not established until 1875.

After taking over the distillery in 1884, Daniel purchased the hollow and land where the distillery is now located. By the 1880s, Jack Daniel&#x27;s was one of 15 distilleries operating in Moore County, and the second-most productive behind Tom Eaton&#x27;s Distillery. He began using square-shaped bottles, intended to convey a sense of fairness and integrity, in 1897.

According to Daniel&#x27;s biographer, the origin of the &quot;Old No. 7&quot; brand name was the number assigned to Daniel&#x27;s distillery for government registration. He was forced to change the registration number when the federal government redrew the district, and he became Number 16 in district 5 instead of No. 7 in district 4. However, he continued to use his original number as a brand name, since the brand reputation had already been established. An entirely different explanation is given in the 1967 book &quot;Jack Daniel&#x27;s Legacy&quot; which states that the name was chosen in 1887 after a visit to a merchant friend in Tullahoma, who had built a chain of seven stores.

Jack Daniel&#x27;s had a surge in popularity after the whiskey received the gold medal for the finest whiskey at the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. However, its local reputation began to suffer as the temperance movement began gaining strength in Tennessee.

Jack Daniel never married and did not have any known children. He took his nephews under his wing – one of whom was Lemuel &quot;Lem&quot; Motlow (1869–1947). Lem, a son of Daniel&#x27;s sister, Finetta, was skilled with numbers. He soon took responsibility for the distillery&#x27;s bookkeeping.

In failing health, Jack Daniel gave the distillery to Lem Motlow and another nephew in 1907. Motlow soon bought out his partner, and went on to operate the distillery for about 40 years.

Tennessee passed a statewide prohibition law in 1910, effectively barring the legal distillation of Jack Daniel&#x27;s within the state. Motlow challenged the law in a test case that eventually worked its way to the Tennessee Supreme Court. The court upheld the law as constitutional.

Daniel died in 1911 from blood poisoning. An oft-told tale is that the infection began in one of his toes, which Daniel injured one early morning at work by kicking his safe in anger when he could not get it open (he was said to always have had trouble remembering the combination). But Daniel&#x27;s modern biographer has asserted that this account is not true.

Because of prohibition in Tennessee, the company shifted its distilling operations to St Louis, Missouri, and Birmingham, Alabama. None of the production from these locations was ever sold due to quality problems. The Alabama operation was halted following a similar statewide prohibition law in that state, and the St. Louis operation fell to the onset of nationwide prohibition following passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1920.

While the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment in 1933 repealed prohibition at the federal level, state prohibition laws (including Tennessee&#x27;s) remained in effect, thus preventing the Lynchburg distillery from reopening. Motlow, who had become a Tennessee state senator, led efforts to repeal these laws, which allowed production to restart in 1938. The five-year gap between national repeal and Tennessee repeal was commemorated in 2008 with a gift pack of two bottles, one for the 75th anniversary of the end of prohibition and a second commemorating the 70th anniversary of the reopening of the distillery.

The Jack Daniel&#x27;s distillery ceased operations from 1942 to 1946 when the U.S. government banned the manufacture of whiskey due to World War II. Motlow resumed production of Jack Daniel&#x27;s in 1947 after good-quality corn was again available. Motlow died the same year, bequeathing the distillery to his children, Robert, Reagor, Dan, Conner, and Mary, upon his death.

The company was later incorporated as &quot;Jack Daniel Distillery, Lem Motlow, Prop., Inc.&quot;, allowing the company to continue to include Motlow in its tradition-oriented marketing. Likewise, company advertisements continue to use Lynchburg&#x27;s 1960s-era population figure of 361, though the city has since formed a consolidated city-county government with Moore County. Its official population is more than 6,000, according to the 2010 census.

The company was sold to the Brown–Forman Corporation in 1956.

The Jack Daniel&#x27;s Distillery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

In 2012 a Welshman, Mark Evans, claimed to have discovered the original recipe for Daniel&#x27;s whiskey in a book written in 1853 by his great-great-grandmother. Evans said that his great-great-grandmother&#x27;s brother-in-law, John &quot;Jack the lad&quot; Daniels, had taken the recipe to Tennessee.

== Recent history ==
=== Lowering to 80 proof ===
Until 1987, Jack Daniel&#x27;s black label was historically produced at 90 U.S. proof (45% alcohol by volume). The lower-end green label product was 80 proof. However, starting in 1987, the other label variations also were reduced in proof. This began with black label being initially reduced to 86 proof. Both the black and green label expressions are made from the same ingredients; the difference is determined by professional tasters, who decide which of the batches would be sold under the &quot;premium&quot; black label, with the rest being sold as &quot;standard&quot; green label.

A further dilution began in 2002 when all generally available Jack Daniel&#x27;s products were reduced to 80 proof, thus further lowering production costs and excise taxes. This reduction in alcohol content, which was done without any announcement, publicity or change of logo or packaging, was noticed and condemned by &quot;Modern Drunkard Magazine&quot;, and the magazine formed a petition drive for drinkers who disagreed with the change. The company countered that it believed consumers preferred lower-proof products, and said that the change had not hurt the sales of the brand. The petition effort garnered some publicity and collected more than 13,000 signatures, but the company held firm with its decision. A few years later, &quot;Advertising Age&quot; said in 2005 that &quot;virtually no one noticed&quot; the change, and confirmed that sales of the brand had actually increased since the dilution began.

Jack Daniel&#x27;s has also produced higher-proof special releases and premium-brand expressions at times. A one-time limited run of 96 proof, the highest proof Jack Daniel&#x27;s had ever bottled at that time, was bottled for the 1996 Tennessee Bicentennial in a decorative bicentennial bottle. The distillery debuted its 94 proof &quot;Jack Daniel&#x27;s Single Barrel&quot; in February 1997. The Silver Select Single Barrel was formerly the company&#x27;s highest proof at 100, but is available only in duty-free shops. Now, there are &#x27;single barrel barrel proof&#x27; editions, ranging from 125 to 140 proof.

=== Sales and brand value status ===
Jack Daniel&#x27;s Black Label Tennessee Whiskey is the best-selling whiskey in the world and remains the flagship product of Brown–Forman Corporation. In 2017 the product had sales of 12.9 million cases. Underlying net sales for the Jack Daniel&#x27;s brand grew by 3% (−1% on a reported basis). Other brand variations, such as Tennessee Honey, Gentleman Jack, and Tennessee Fire, added another 2.9 million cases to sales. Sales of an additional 800,000 equivalent cases in ready to drink (RTD) products brought the fiscal year total to more than 16.1 million equivalent adjusted cases for the entire Jack Daniel&#x27;s family of brands.

Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire were also solid contributors to the total underlying net sales growth of 3% (flat on a reported basis) for the Jack Daniel&#x27;s family of brands. They grew underlying net sales by 4% and 14% (3% and 18% on a reported basis), respectively. Premium brand Gentleman Jack grew underlying net sales mid-single digits, while the RTD/RTP segment increased underlying net sales by 6% (3% on a reported basis).

In the IWSR 2013 World Class Brands rankings of wine and spirits brands, Jack Daniel&#x27;s was ranked third on the global level. More recently, in 2017, it ranked at number 16 on the IWSR&#x27;s Real 100 Spirits Brands Worldwide list. Additionally, the brand evaluation consultancy &quot;Intangible Business&quot; ranked Jack Daniel&#x27;s fourth on its Power 100 Spirits and Wine list in both 2014 and 2015.

=== Sponsorships ===

From 2006 until 2015, Jack Daniel&#x27;s sponsored V8 Supercar teams Perkins Engineering and Kelly Racing. Jack Daniel&#x27;s also sponsored the Richard Childress Racing 07 car (numbered after the &quot;Old No. 7&quot;) in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series from 2005 to 2009, beginning with driver Dave Blaney and soon moving to Clint Bowyer. Jack Daniel&#x27;s also sponsors Zac Brown Band&#x27;s tours.

In September 2022, Jack Daniel&#x27;s signed a multi-year partnership deal with McLaren starting from the 2023 season onwards. As part of the partnership, Jack Daniel&#x27;s released a McLaren Racing limited edition of the Old No. 7 which paid tribute to the founders of both companies – Jack Daniel and Bruce McLaren. For the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix, McLaren raced a special Jack Daniel&#x27;s branded livery with a Jack Daniel&#x27;s collage highlighted across both cars&#x27; rear sidepod and engine cover.

=== Master distillers ===
Former Master Distillers include Nathan &quot;Nearest&quot; Green (1875–81), Jess Motlow (1911–41), Lem Tolley (1941–64), Jess Gamble (1964–66), and Frank Bobo (1966–92).

Jimmy Bedford held the position for 20 years. Bedford retired in mid-2008 after being the subject of a $3.5 million sexual harassment lawsuit against the company that ended in an out-of-court settlement, and he died on August 7, 2009, after suffering a heart attack at his home in Lynchburg.

Jeff Arnett, a company employee since 2001, became Master Distiller in 2008. On September 3, 2020, Arnett announced that he was stepping down from the company. On April 20, 2021, he announced that he and partners were opening Company Distilling, a new whiskey distillery, near the Great Smokey Mountains.

Chris Fletcher became the 8th Master Distiller in 2020 after serving as Assistant Master Distiller for six years prior. Fletcher is the grandson of former Master Distiller, Frank Bobo.

=== Tennessee Squires ===
A Tennessee Squire is a member of the Tennessee Squire Association, which was formed in 1956 to honor special friends of the Jack Daniel&#x27;s distillery. Many prominent business and entertainment professionals are included among the membership, which is obtained only through recommendation of a current member. Squires receive a wallet card and deed certificate proclaiming them as &quot;owner&quot; of an unrecorded plot of land at the distillery and an honorary citizen of Moore County, Tennessee.

== Production process ==


The mash for Jack Daniel&#x27;s is composed of 80% corn, 12% rye, and 8% malted barley, and is distilled in copper stills. It is then filtered through stacks of sugar maple charcoal. The company refers to this filtering step as &quot;mellowing&quot;. This extra step, known as the Lincoln County Process, removes impurities and the taste of corn. The company argues this extra step makes the product different from bourbon. However, Tennessee whiskey is required to be &quot;a straight Bourbon Whiskey&quot; under terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement and Canadian law. A distinctive aspect of the filtering process is that the Jack Daniel&#x27;s brand grinds its charcoal before using it for filtering. After the filtering, the whiskey is stored in newly handcrafted oak barrels, which give the whiskey its color and most of its flavor.

The product label mentions that it is a &quot;sour mash&quot; whiskey, which means that when the mash is prepared, some of the wet solids from a previously used batch are mixed in to help make the fermentation process operate more consistently. This is common practice in American whiskey production. (, all straight bourbon is produced using the sour mash process.)

Prior to 2014, the company&#x27;s barrels were produced by Brown-Forman in Louisville, Kentucky. That year, the company opened a new cooperage in Trinity, Alabama.

== Legal status ==
On a state level, Tennessee has imposed stringent requirements. To be labeled as Tennessee whiskey, it is not enough under state law that the whiskey be produced in Tennessee; it must meet quality and production standards. These are the same standards used by Jack Daniel&#x27;s Distillery, and some other distillers are displeased with the requirements being enshrined into law.

On May 13, 2013, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam signed House Bill 1084, requiring the Lincoln County process to be used for products produced in the state labeling themselves as &quot;Tennessee Whiskey&quot;, with a particular exception tailored to exempt Benjamin Prichard&#x27;s, and including the existing requirements for bourbon. As federal law requires statements of origin on labels to be accurate, the Tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to Tennessee whiskey, requiring Tennessee origin, maple charcoal filtering by the Lincoln County process prior to aging, and the basic requirements of bourbon (at least 51% corn, new oak barrels, charring of the barrels, and limits on alcohol by volume concentration for distillation, aging, and bottling).

In 2014 legislation was introduced in the Tennessee legislature that would modify the 2013 law to allow the reuse of oak barrels in the Tennessee whiskey aging process. Jack Daniel&#x27;s Master Distiller Jeff Arnett vehemently opposed the legislation, arguing the reuse of barrels would require the use of artificial colorings and flavorings, and would render Tennessee whiskey an inferior product to Scotch and bourbon.

The company was the subject of a proposal to locally surtax its product in 2011. It was claimed that the distillery, the main employer in a company town, had capitalized on the bucolic image of Lynchburg, Tennessee, and it ought to pay a tax of $10 per barrel. The company responded that such a tax is a confiscatory imposition penalizing it for the success of the enterprise. The proposed tax faced a vote by the Metro Lynchburg-Moore County Council and was defeated 10–5.

Moore County, where the Jack Daniel&#x27;s distillery is located, is one of the state&#x27;s many dry counties. While it is legal to distill the product within the county, it is illegal to purchase it there. However, a state law has provided one exception: a distillery may sell one commemorative product at a time, regardless of county statutes.

== Distillery ==
The Jack Daniel Distillery in Lynchburg is situated in and around a hollow known as &quot;Stillhouse Hollow&quot; or &quot;Jack Daniel&#x27;s Hollow&quot;, where a spring flows from a cave at the base of a limestone cliff. The limestone removes iron from the water, making it ideal for distilling whiskey (water heavy in iron gives whiskey a bad taste). The spring feeds into nearby East Fork Mulberry Creek, which is part of the Elk River watershed. Some 1.9 million barrels containing the aging whiskey are stored in several dozen barrelhouses, some of which adorn the adjacent hilltops and are visible throughout Lynchburg.

The distillery is a major tourist attraction, drawing more than a quarter of a million visitors annually. The visitor center, dedicated in June 2000, contains memorabilia related to the distillery and a gift shop. Paid tours of the distillery are conducted several times per day and a premium sampling tour is also offered.

In February 2016 a $140 million expansion was announced for the distillery, including a plan to expand the visitors center and add two more barrel houses.

== Mixed Drinks ==
* Jack Daniel&#x27;s is the alcoholic component of &quot;Jack and Coke&quot;, a common variant of a highball also known as Bourbon and Coke.

* Jack Daniel&#x27;s is also the alcoholic component of &quot;Lynchburg Lemonade&quot;.
* Jack Daniel&#x27;s is a common choice for the Tennessee Whiskey component of the &quot;Three Wise Men&quot;.

<doc id="384096" wikidata="Q7993413" url="?curid=384096" title="Where no man has gone before">
<text>&quot;Where no man has gone before&quot; is a phrase made popular through its use in the title sequence of the original 1966–1969 &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction television series, describing the mission of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The complete introductory speech, spoken by William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk at the beginning of each episode, is:

This introduction began every episode of the series except the two pilot episodes: &quot;The Cage&quot; (which preceded Shatner&#x27;s involvement) and &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. This introduction was used for the beginning of each episode of the show &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, but with the phrase &quot;five-year mission&quot; changed to a more open-ended &quot;continuing mission&quot;, and the final phrase changed to the gender- and species-neutral &quot;where no one has gone before&quot;. The complete introduction, spoken by Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, is: 

The series produced after &quot;The Next Generation&quot; would not use any form of introductory speeches, until the prequel series &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;. The introduction, spoken by Anson Mount as Captain Christopher Pike, Kirk’s predecessor, leads the title sequence of every episode and combines Kirk’s version of the speech with the neutral final phrase.

==Origin==
A variation of the phrase &quot;where no man has gone before&quot;, , was first used by the noted Portuguese poet Luís de Camões in his epic poem &quot;The Lusiads&quot;, published in 1572. The poem celebrates the Portuguese nation and its discovery of the sea route to India by Vasco da Gama. 

Blogger Dwayne A. Day says the quotation was taken from &quot;Introduction to Outer Space,&quot; a White House booklet published in 1958 to garner support for a national space program in the wake of the Sputnik flight. It read on page 1:
The first of these factors is the compelling urge of man to explore and to discover, the thrust of curiosity that leads men to try to go where no one has gone before. Most of the surface of the earth has now been explored and men now turn to the exploration of outer space as their next objective.

Following an early expedition to Newfoundland, Captain James Cook declared that he intended to go not only &quot;... , but as far as I think it is possible for a man to go&quot; (emphasis added). Cook&#x27;s most famous ship, the &quot;Endeavour&quot;, lent its name to the last-produced Space Shuttle, much as the &quot;Star Trek&quot; starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; lent its name to the Shuttle program&#x27;s test craft.

Similar expressions have been used in literature before 1958. For example, H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s novella &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;, written in 1927 and published in 1943, includes this passage:
At length, sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs, nor able sleeping or waking to drive them from his mind, Carter resolved to go with bold entreaty whither no man had gone before, and dare the icy deserts through the dark to where unknown Kadath, veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars, holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the Great Ones.

The phrase was first introduced into &quot;Star Trek&quot; by Samuel Peeples, who is attributed with suggesting it be used as an episode name. The episode became &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, the second pilot of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The phrase itself was subsequently worked into the show&#x27;s opening narration, which was written in August 1966, after several episodes had been filmed, and shortly before the series was due to debut. It is the result of the combined input of several people, including &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry and producers John D. F. Black and Bob Justman. One of the earliest drafts is as follows:
This is the adventure of the United Space Ship &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Assigned a five year galaxy patrol, the bold crew of the giant starship explores the excitement of strange new worlds, uncharted civilizations, and exotic people. These are its voyages and its adventures...
Under their influence, the above narrative quote went through several revisions before being selected for use in the TV series.

In-universe, the sentence was attributed in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; pilot episode &quot;Broken Bow&quot; to warp drive inventor Dr. Zefram Cochrane in a recorded speech during the dedication of the facility devoted to designing the first engine capable of reaching Warp 5 — thus making interstellar exploration practical for humans — in the year 2119, some thirty-two years before the 2151 launch of the first vessel powered by such an engine, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NX-01):

==Other uses==
Leonard Nimoy as Spock delivered a slightly altered version of the full monologue at the end of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, separate from the version used on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. In this version, the monologue describes the crew&#x27;s mission as a search not just for new life, but for &quot;new life&quot;forms&quot;&quot;. The first statement, &quot;These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise&quot; is also augmented as &quot;These are the &quot;continuing&quot; voyages of the starship Enterprise&quot;; the ship&#x27;s &quot;five-year mission&quot; is consequently changed to the crew&#x27;s &quot;&quot;ongoing&quot; mission&quot;. The complete monologue is:
The final phrase is referenced in-universe as Kirk narrates his final captain&#x27;s log at the conclusion of &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;; he notes that the next crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; will continue &quot;boldly going where no man... where no one... has gone before&quot;, a change prompted by criticism from aliens earlier in the film of the crew&#x27;s human-centrism. The neutral version of the final phrase had already been in use in the introductory speech for &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, which debuted four years earlier.

The full monologue was once again spoken at the end of the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; series finale, &quot;These Are the Voyages...,&quot; by the captains of the three main starships (NCC-1701-D, NCC-1701, and NX-01) to bear the name &quot;Enterprise&quot;; Patrick Stewart spoke the first two sentences, William Shatner the third and fourth, and Scott Bakula — as Captain Jonathan Archer — the final sentence. This version combines the phrases &quot;Its continuing mission&quot; (spoken by Stewart) and &quot;where no man has gone before&quot; (spoken by Bakula) into the same speech.

Versions of the full monologue were used at the end of each film in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot trilogy; all use the more neutral final phrase. In the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the monologue is spoken by Leonard Nimoy and uses his version from &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; with the word &quot;continuing&quot; removed. The monologue is used in-universe as part of a speech delivered by Chris Pine&#x27;s Kirk at the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s re-dedication ceremony in &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;; the version spoken by William Shatner&#x27;s Kirk is used, altered with &quot;&quot;Her&quot; five-year mission&quot;. &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; uses the same version from &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, spoken by Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Bones, Sulu, Chekov, and Uhura.

==Outside &quot;Star Trek&quot;==
The phrase has also gained popularity outside &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 1989, NASA used the phrase to title its retrospective of Project Apollo: &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before: A History of Apollo Lunar Exploration Missions&quot;.

The phrase has become a snowclone, a rhetorical device and type of word play in which one word within it is replaced while maintaining the overall structure. For example, a 2002 episode of &quot;Futurama&quot; that dealt with a character&#x27;s devotion to &quot;Star Trek&quot; is named &quot;Where No Fan Has Gone Before&quot;, a level in the video game &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time&quot; is called &quot;Starbase: Where No Turtle Has Gone Before&quot;. The Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti became the first barista in space on the International Space Station, tweeting &quot;To Boldly Brew...&quot; in May 2015; she wore Star Trek garb for the occasion.

The phrase was parodied on the retail box of the 1987 computer game &quot;Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter,&quot; which read &quot;His mission: to scrub dirty decks...to replace burned-out lightbulbs...TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS SWEPT THE FLOOR!&quot; (emphasis original). In 1992, Apple&#x27;s Star Trek project, a port of their Mac OS 7 operating system to Intel x86 processors, was referred to as &quot;the OS that boldly goes where everyone else has been&quot;. In the sci-fi show &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, the character Susan Ivanova implies that a woman is promiscuous by telling Captain John Sheridan, &quot;Good luck, Captain. I think you&#x27;re about to go where... everyone has gone before.&quot;

The split infinitive &quot;to boldly go&quot; has also been the subject of jokes regarding its grammatical correctness. British humorist and science-fiction author Douglas Adams describes, in his series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, the long-lost heroic age of the Galactic Empire, when bold adventurers dared &quot;to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before&quot;. In the 1995 book &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot;, Lawrence M. Krauss begins a list of &quot;Star Trek&#x27;s&quot; ten worst errors by quoting one of his colleagues who considers that their greatest mistake is &quot;to split an infinitive every damn time&quot;.

<text>Jack Tupper Daniels (born April 26, 1933) is an American exercise physiologist, running coach and a coach of Olympic athletes. On March 21, 2013, he was named the head coach of the Wells College men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country programs. He received his doctoral degree in exercise physiology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Named &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Coach&quot; by Runner&#x27;s World magazine,
he led SUNY Cortland runners to eight NCAA Division III National Championships, 31 individual national titles, and more than 130 All-America awards. Daniels outlined his training philosophies in the 1998 book, &quot;Daniels&#x27; Running Formula&quot;. He mentors and coaches some of America&#x27;s top distance runners in the country.

Daniels won a team silver medal in the 1956 Summer Olympics and a team bronze medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics for his participation in the modern pentathlon.

==VDOT==
In the 1970s, Daniels and his colleague, Jimmy Gilbert, examined the performances and known VO2max values of elite middle and long distance runners. Although the laboratory determined VO2max values of these runners may have been different, equally performing runners were assigned equal aerobic profiles. Daniels labeled these &quot;pseudoVO2max&quot; or &quot;effective VO2max&quot; values as VDOT values. According to Daniels, VDOT is a shortened form of V̇O2max, properly stated as &quot;V-dot-O2max&quot;.

With the result of a recent competition, a runner can find his or her VDOT value and determine an &quot;equivalent performance&quot; at a different race distance. Given that runners with identical VO2max values may have differences in running economy/efficiency, biomechanics, and mental toughness, Daniels concludes that VDOT is, due to this holistic view, a better value from which to assess fitness and determine training paces.

==Training philosophy==
Daniels divides running performance into six components. Daniels argues that each of these components requires a specific training intensity to improve.

*The Cardiovascular System, specifically the body&#x27;s ability to transport oxygen.
*The Running muscles&#x27; ability to use oxygen.
*The Lactate threshold - the ability to cope with, and minimize, lactic acid in the blood.
*The VO2max - the maximum oxygen uptake capacity.
*Speed, for example leg turnover.
*The Running economy - the efficiency of the runner&#x27;s movements.

===Training intensities===
Daniels uses five specific training intensities to improve the different components above. A runner can determine the correct speed for each intensity based on the VDOT from a recent performance.

====Easy / Long (E/L) pace====
At 60-79% of maximum heart rate (HRmax), this non-straining intensity is used for recovery runs, warm-up, cool-down and long runs. The primary purpose is to build a base for more intense workouts by strengthening the heart and increasing the muscles&#x27; ability to use oxygen, and to recover between hard workouts. Daniels recommends that most training miles are performed in E pace.

Typical E runs include continuous runs up to about an hour.

====Marathon (M) pace====
At 80-85% HRmax, this intensity is primarily aimed towards runners training for the marathon. The pace is one at which the runner hopes to compete. The pace can be included in other programs for a more intense workout, especially if the runner feels fresh and there is enough time to recover afterwards.

M-runs are performed as continuous runs up to about two hours, or as long interval training.

====Threshold (T) pace====
At 82-88% HRmax, this intensity is aimed to raise the lactate threshold. The runner should be able to sustain this pace for up to 60 minutes during racing. Daniels describes this intensity as &quot;comfortably hard&quot;. In elite runners, the pace matches the half marathon one, while less trained runners will run at around 10k pace. Daniels points out the importance of keeping the given pace to reap the benefits of the training.

T runs are typically performed as continuous &quot;tempo&quot; runs for 20 minutes or more, or as &quot;cruise&quot; interval training with 3 to 10 long bouts of about 3 to 15 minutes each, having 20%-25% rest intervals in between. &quot;T&quot; runs of longer than 20 minutes can be done at slightly reduced pace, according to a table in his book. No more than 10% of the weekly miles should be run at T pace.

====Interval (I) pace====
Intensity at 97-100% HRmax. This intensity stresses the VO2max to raise the maximum oxygen uptake capacity. Since the pace is very intense, it can only be sustained for up to 12 minutes during racing. To cope with the intensity, and to train for longer periods of time, this training is performed as interval training, hence the name. The interval between each work bout should be a little less than the time of the work bout. Optimum intervals are 3–5 minutes long. There is no benefit to exceeding 5 minutes at this pace, under Daniels&#x27; theory, which means that despite the popularity of mile-repeats in many running groups, Daniels discourages them for people whose pace is slower than about 5:00/mile, preferring shorter intervals such as 1200 meters.

For example, an I session can be 6 x 800 m at I pace with 400 m recovery jogs. At most 8% of the weekly training miles should be I pace.

====Repetition (R) pace====
R pace is very fast training aimed to improve speed and running economy. The training is performed as short interval training, with typically 200 m, 300 m, or 400 m work outs, with full recovery intervals in between. No more than 5% of the weekly miles should be R pace.

==Coaching==
Daniels was hired as the head coach of the Wells College men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country programs on March 21, 2013. Prior to joining the Express, Daniels served as the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field/cross country coach at the State University of New York at Cortland for 17 years while also serving as a physical education professor for the college. Across his coaching career with the Red Dragons, Daniels has coached 30 individual Division III NCAA National Champions, eight NCAA National Team Champions and 130 All-Americans.

Daniels began coaching online in 2008 and is currently part-owner and head coach of The Run SMART Project.

==Critique==
Tim Noakes has proposed that maximal exercise performance is regulated by a &quot;central governor&quot; rather than a limiting cardiorespiratory function (i.e. VO2 max). Noakes challenges the explanatory power of Daniels&#x27; training model (Cardiovascular/Anaerobic) stating that there is a lack of published evidence supporting the claim that each training intensity only improves one of the six physiological components described above. He also states that Daniels&#x27; division in components is also not considered complete, e.g. leaving out the muscles&#x27; ability to absorb the pounding of running a marathon. But he has acknowledged the efficacy of Daniels&#x27; training methods, and stated that science may one day catch up with the explanations, but his methods are effective.

<text>Roberto Alomar Velázquez (; ; born February 5, 1968) is a Puerto Rican former second baseman who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for seventeen seasons. He is regarded as one of the greatest second basemen and all-around players in baseball history. During his career, the 12-time All-Star won more Gold Glove Awards (10) than any other second baseman in baseball history, in addition to winning four Silver Slugger Awards for his hitting. Among second basemen, he ranks third in games played (2,320), fifth in stolen bases (474), sixth in plate appearances (10,400), seventh in doubles (504) and assists (6,524), and eighth in hits (2,724), runs (1,508), at-bats (9,073), and double plays turned (1,407). In 2011, Alomar was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

The son of MLB second baseman Sandy Alomar Sr., Alomar followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, signing with the San Diego Padres as an amateur free agent in 1985. He made his major league debut with the team three years later, establishing himself as an exceptional base-stealing, hitting, and fielding threat before becoming an All-Star in 1990. He was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays the following off-season, leading the team to three consecutive American League Championship Series (ALCS) appearances and being named the 1992 ALCS Most Valuable Player (MVP), culminating in back-to-back World Series championships in 1992 and 1993. Alomar signed with the Baltimore Orioles after the 1995 season, led the team to two ALCS appearances, and won the 1998 All-Star Game MVP Award in his final year with the team. He then joined the Cleveland Indians for three seasons and had the most productive years of his career in 1999 and 2001, again leading his team to the playoffs and becoming an AL MVP Award finalist both years. Alomar spent the final years of his career with the New York Mets, the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Chicago White Sox, before retiring at spring training in 2005. A switch hitter, Alomar finished his career with a .300 batting average. Shortly after his 2011 Hall of Fame induction, the Blue Jays retired his number 12.

In 2021, Alomar was banned from baseball by MLB following an independent investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, dating back to 2014. In April 2021, the Blue Jays also announced that Alomar would be removed from the Level of Excellence and his retired number banner would be taken down at Rogers Centre. The Blue Jays have subsequently reactivated the uniform number 12, and it has been used by other players. He remains the only player in history to be a member of both the Baseball Hall of Fame and MLB&#x27;s permanently-ineligible list simultaneously.

==Early life==
Alomar was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and raised in Salinas, Puerto Rico. The son of Santos &quot;Sandy&quot; Alomar Sr. and María Velázquez, Alomar grew up in a baseball family. He and his older brother Sandy Jr. were raised mostly by their mother, due to their father&#x27;s career as a major league second baseman. When school in Puerto Rico was out for the summer, they joined their father, who let his sons hang around the clubhouse, shag fly balls, and absorb the game—especially from his New York Yankees teammates, such as Thurman Munson and Graig Nettles. Growing up, Alomar idolized his father and José Cruz, both of whom were All-Star players.

==Career==

===San Diego Padres===
In 1985, Alomar signed with the San Diego Padres at age 17, and joined the team&#x27;s Class-A affiliate, the Charleston Rainbows. The following year, playing for the Reno Padres, he won the California League batting title with a .346 average.

Alomar made his major league debut on April 22, 1988, against the Houston Astros, recording a hit in his first at bat, off of Nolan Ryan. With the Padres, he established himself as a solid hitter and baserunner, and defensively, he displayed excellent lateral range and a powerful arm, often making spectacular plays on ground balls hit deep in the hole between first and second base, and on balls hit up the middle, well behind second base. He became an All-Star for the first time in 1990, as a reserve player for the National League.

===Toronto Blue Jays===

On December 5, 1990, Alomar and Joe Carter were traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for Fred McGriff and Tony Fernández. It was in Toronto that he developed into a premier offensive second baseman, combining a .300-plus batting average with power and high end speed on the bases. In 1991, he capitalized on his speed with 11 triples and 53 stolen bases, leading the team to its first of three consecutive playoff appearances. The following year, he scored 105 runs, drew 87 walks, and had a .405 on-base percentage. In 1993, Alomar had his best season with the Blue Jays, producing 17 home runs (HR), 93 runs batted in (RBI), and 55 stolen bases, while batting .326, third in the American League behind teammates John Olerud and Paul Molitor. He was a central figure in Toronto&#x27;s World Series championships in 1992 and 1993; in Game 6 of the 1992 World Series, he scored the series-winning run on Dave Winfield&#x27;s two-run double in the 11th inning. Alomar&#x27;s game-tying, ninth-inning home run against Oakland relief ace Dennis Eckersley, in Game 4 of the 1992 American League Championship Series (ALCS), is considered by many as the most important hit in the club&#x27;s history, as the team&#x27;s three previous trips to the ALCS had ended in disappointment; he was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series. In 1995, he played 104 consecutive games without committing an error, setting an AL record for second basemen. In each of his five seasons with the Blue Jays, Alomar was named to the All-Star team and won the Gold Glove Award.

===Baltimore Orioles===

On December 21, 1995, Alomar signed with the Baltimore Orioles at a time when Toronto was looking to rebuild, while Baltimore was improving into a pennant-contending team. In Baltimore, he paired with Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr. to form a formidable double-play combination. Alomar appeared in the playoffs in 1996 and 1997 for the Orioles, hitting a series-winning home run in Game 4 of the 1996 American League Division Series (ALDS), although the Orioles were defeated in the ALCS both years. In 1998, he was named the Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game MVP.

====Spitting incident====
On September 27, 1996, during a game against the Blue Jays, Alomar got into a heated argument over a called third strike with umpire John Hirschbeck and spat in his face. He defended himself by saying Hirschbeck had uttered a racial slur and that Hirschbeck had been bitter since one son had died of ALD and another had been recently diagnosed as well. Upon hearing of Alomar&#x27;s comments, Hirschbeck had to be physically restrained from confronting Alomar in the players&#x27; locker room.

Alomar was suspended for the first five regular-season games in 1997 and donated $50,000 to ALD research. Alomar and Hirschbeck settled their differences publicly and made apologies to each other on April 22, 1997, standing at home plate and shaking hands in front of the crowd before an Orioles game.

===Cleveland Indians===

On November 24, 1998, Alomar signed a four-year contract with the Cleveland Indians, joining his All-Star brother, Sandy Jr. It was in Cleveland that Alomar had two of his finest seasons. In 1999, he hit .323 and set career highs with 24 home runs, 120 RBI, 138 runs, 99 walks, a .422 on-base percentage and a .533 slugging percentage. In 2001, he batted .336/.415/.541, with 20 home runs, 100 RBI, and 30 steals. Cleveland made the playoffs in 1999, losing in the ALDS to the Boston Red Sox; in 2001, they again made the playoffs, but lost to the Seattle Mariners in the ALDS. Alomar finished third in AL MVP voting in 1999 and fourth in 2001.

On the field, Alomar teamed with shortstop Omar Vizquel to form another decorated middle infield combination. The Vizquel-Alomar duo won three consecutive Gold Gloves together, becoming one of just eight shortstop-second baseman duos to have accomplished this feat in the same year.

Alomar was traded to the New York Mets before the 2002 season, for pitcher Billy Traber and outfielders Matt Lawton and Alex Escobar.

===Last years of career===
In 2002, Alomar hit only .266/.331/.376 with 53 RBI and 73 runs scored, while falling apart defensively at second base. The Mets were puzzled by Alomar&#x27;s mediocre play, which some attributed to his lack of comfort with being under the greater scrutiny of the New York fans and media. However, not even a midseason trade back to the American League to the Chicago White Sox in 2003 could revive Alomar from his funk. There was more misery ahead with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2004, including a two-month disabled stint with a broken right hand. On August 5, Alomar returned to the White Sox, and hit just .263/.321/.392 in 56 games.

Alomar agreed to a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for the 2005 season. However, on March 19, 2005, after a spring training plagued by back and vision trouble, he announced his retirement.

==Legacy==

&quot;Time&quot; called Alomar &quot;the best second baseman of t[his] generation&quot; and he is regarded as one of the greatest second basemen and all-around players of all time. Known for his acrobatic and flamboyant style of defense, Alomar won 10 Gold Glove Awards, establishing a major league record for second basemen. He ranks in the top 10 of several all-time categories for second basemen, including games played, stolen bases, plate appearances, doubles, assists, hits, runs, at bats, and double plays turned. In a 17-year career, he was a .300/.371/.443 hitter with 210 home runs and 1,134 RBI; his .307 career batting average as a member of the Blue Jays is a franchise record. He was the Blue Jays Player of the Year in 1991, 1992, and 1995, as well as the Cleveland Indians Man of the Year in 1999 and 2001. A clutch hitter, Alomar had a .313 postseason average, including a .347 average in two World Series appearances. His game-tying home run in Game 4 of the 1992 ALCS is often considered the most important hit in Blue Jays history, as it changed the fortunes of the franchise.

Alomar was known for having a &quot;sixth sense&quot; or &quot;sixth tool&quot;—awareness—which distinguished him from other players. His former manager Davey Johnson said of him, &quot;He reminds me of some of the great players that I&#x27;ve played with, who seem like they write their own script  ... Frank Robinson&#x27;s one, Henry Aaron was the other.&quot; He became only the third Puerto Rican to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, after Roberto Clemente and Orlando Cepeda, and has since been joined by Iván Rodríguez and Edgar Martínez.

==Post-playing honors and activities==

On April 4, 2008, Alomar was inducted into the Blue Jays Level of Excellence at Rogers Centre, prior to the team&#x27;s home opener. Alomar has since been removed from the Blue Jays Level of Excellence due to allegations of sexual misconduct.

In 2010, Alomar&#x27;s first year of Hall of Fame eligibility, he missed induction by eight votes. His 73.7% of the vote was the highest percentage of votes in any player&#x27;s first year on the ballot without being elected. Some baseball writers expressed shock that he failed to get in on the first ballot, but many attributed the near-miss to sportswriters holding a grudge over the 1996 spitting incident with John Hirschbeck, including Alomar&#x27;s brother Sandy Jr. and Hirschbeck himself. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in his second year of eligibility, with 90% of the vote (523 of 581 ballots cast). On July 24, 2011, Alomar was inducted into the Hall of Fame, becoming the first inductee to be depicted as a Blue Jays player on his plaque.

On June 19, 2010, Alomar was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in St. Marys, Ontario.

The 2011 Caribbean Series was dedicated to him, which was followed by his induction into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame.

On March 31, 2011, Alomar was named as a special assistant to the Blue Jays organization. The following year, he began hosting the annual Tournament 12 (T12) showcase at Rogers Centre for Canadian baseball prospects; major leaguers Josh Naylor, Mike Soroka, and Abraham Toro are alumni of the tournament.

On July 31, 2011, the Blue Jays retired Alomar&#x27;s number 12 at Rogers Centre. He was the first Blue Jay to be so honored. The number has since been unretired after the Blue Jays severed all ties to him due to allegations of sexual misconduct.

On August 3, 2013, Alomar was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame.

On November 12, 2013, Alomar launched a baseball equipment line, Alomar Baseball.

On September 24, 2015, Alomar was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in Toronto.

Alomar guest-starred on an episode of Canadian sitcom &quot;Mr. D&quot; in an episode when students ran an &quot;Alomar for President&quot; campaign during the Student Council Elections.

In 2017, Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred named Alomar a special consultant, tasked with helping grow baseball in Puerto Rico.

In July 2020, it was announced that Alomar was launching an expansion team in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente. The team, based in San Juan and named RA12 (after his initials and uniform number), began competing during the 2020–21 season. He also became a member of the LBPRC Board of Directors.

==Sexual misconduct allegations==
On April 30, 2021, Alomar was fired from both the Blue Jays and MLB amid reports that MLB was investigating claims that a female Blue Jays staffer claimed that Alomar had sexually harassed her in 2014. According to The Sports Network, the staffer was preparing to sue Alomar, the Blue Jays, and MLB. Later on April 30, Manfred announced that following an investigation into those allegations that had taken several months, Alomar had been placed on MLB&#x27;s ineligible list and banned from baseball. At the same time, the Blue Jays severed all ties with Alomar, removing his name from the &quot;Level of Excellence&quot; at the Rogers Centre and taking down his Hall of Fame banner. However, he will remain enshrined in the Hall of Fame. Alomar&#x27;s number was officially unretired August 1, 2023 when newly acquired pitcher Jordan Hicks donned number 12 and entered the game for the Blue Jays in the ninth inning.

Following the actions taken by MLB and the Blue Jays, the complainant declined to pursue further legal action.

==Personal life==
Alomar married Puerto Rican model Maripily Rivera on June 1, 2009. The next year, Rivera alleged that she had been a victim of domestic violence on three occasions, including her life being threatened with a knife by Alomar, and she wanted to end the marriage. Alomar alleged that Rivera had threatened to divorce him unless he gave her half ownership of his Tampa residence. The divorce was finalized on July 12, 2011, with a private settlement.

In 1996, a Canadian woman who became obsessed with Alomar was sentenced to nine months in prison for plotting to murder him. She was arrested with a loaded gun after telling security at the SkyDome of her plans.

Alomar has been sued by at least four women, including his ex-wife, for allegedly exposing them to HIV. He was in a relationship with professional tennis player Meghann Shaughnessy from 2004 to 2006, who claimed Alomar exposed her to HIV. The lawyer of Alomar&#x27;s ex-wife stated Alomar paid $4 million in settlements to Shaughnessy and Ilya Dall, another ex-girlfriend.

On December 12, 2012, Alomar married Toronto native Kim Perks at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Their first daughter was born in 2014. The Alomars reside in Toronto.

<text>In the C++ programming language, the C++ Standard Library is a collection of classes and functions, which are written in the core language and part of the C++ ISO Standard itself.

==Overview==
The C++ Standard Library provides several generic containers, functions to use and manipulate these containers, function objects, generic strings and streams (including interactive and file I/O), support for some language features, and functions for common tasks such as finding the square root of a number. The C++ Standard Library also incorporates most headers of the ISO C standard library ending with &quot;&quot;, but their use was deprecated (reverted the deprecation since C++23). C++23 instead considers these headers as useful for interoperability with C, and recommends against their usage outside of programs that are intended to be both valid C and C++ programs. No other headers in the C++ Standard Library end in &quot;&quot;. Features of the C++ Standard Library are declared within the codice_1 namespace.

The C++ Standard Library is based upon conventions introduced by the Standard Template Library (STL), and has been influenced by research in generic programming and developers of the STL such as Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee. Although the C++ Standard Library and the STL share many features, neither is a strict superset of the other.

A noteworthy feature of the C++ Standard Library is that it not only specifies the syntax and semantics of generic algorithms, but also places requirements on their performance. These performance requirements often correspond to a well-known algorithm, which is expected but not required to be used. In most cases this requires linear time O(&quot;n&quot;) or linearithmic time O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;), but in some cases higher bounds are allowed, such as quasilinear time O(&quot;n&quot; log2 &quot;n&quot;) for stable sort (to allow in-place merge sort). Previously, sorting was only required to take O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) on average, allowing the use of quicksort, which is fast in practice but has poor worst-case performance, but introsort was introduced to allow both fast average performance and optimal worst-case complexity, and as of C++11, sorting is guaranteed to be at worst linearithmic. In other cases requirements remain laxer, such as selection, which is only required to be linear on average (as in quickselect), not requiring worst-case linear as in introselect.

The C++ Standard Library underwent ISO standardization as part of the C++ ISO Standardization effort in the 1990s. Since 2011, it has been expanded and updated every three years with each revision of the C++ standard.

Since C++23, the C++ Standard Library can be imported using modules, which were introduced in C++20.

==Implementations==
===Discontinued===
====Apache C++ Standard Library====
The Apache C++ Standard Library is another open-source implementation. It was originally developed commercially by Rogue Wave Software and later donated to the Apache Software Foundation. However, after more than five years without a release, the board of the Apache Software Foundation decided to end this project and move it to Apache Attic.

===See also===
The following libraries implement much of the C++ Standard Library:
==Standard modules==
Although modules were first introduced in C++20, standard library modules were only standardised as part of the language in C++23. These named modules were added to include all items declared in both global and codice_1 namespaces provided by the importable standard headers. Macros are not allowed to be exportable, so users have to manually include or import headers that emit macros for use.

The C++ standard has reserved codice_1 and codice_4 as module names, however most compilers allow a flag to override this.

The current standard library modules defined by the standard as of C++23 are:

The above modules export the entire C++ standard library, meaning that as of currently, the standard library must be imported in its entirety. Furthermore, modules do not allow for granular imports of specific namespaces, classes, or symbols within a module, unlike Java or Rust which do allow for the aforementioned. Importing a module imports all symbols marked with codice_5, making it akin to a wildcard import in Java or Rust.

Like Java&#x27;s packages, C++ modules do not have a hierarchical system, but typically use a hierarchical naming convention. In other words, C++ does not have &quot;submodules&quot;, meaning the codice_6 symbol which may be included in a module name bears no syntactic meaning and is used only to suggest the association of a module. As an example, codice_7 is not a submodule of codice_1, but is named so to indicate the association the module bears to the codice_1 module (as a &quot;compatibility&quot; version of it).

It has been proposed that additional modules providing other subsets of the standard library be added, which may eventually be included in a future revision. These include:
==Standard headers==
The following files contain the declarations of the C++ Standard Library.

Legend:&lt;br&gt;
: Deprecated&lt;br&gt;
: Removed

===General===
Components that C++ programs may use for increased features.
===Language support===
Components that C++ programs may use for support during development.
===Containers===

Components that C++ programs may use for container data structures.
===Iterators and ranges===
Components that C++ programs may use to manipulate iterators, ranges, and algorithms over ranges and containers.
===Localisation===
Components that C++ programs may use for localisation and character encoding manipulation.
===Strings===
Components that C++ programs may use for string manipulation.
===Streams, files, and input/output===
Components that C++ programs may use for input/output manipulation and file manipulation.
===Thread support library===
Components that C++ programs may use for threading and concurrent programming.
===Numerics library===
Components that C++ programs may use to perform seminumerical or mathematical operations.
===C standard library===

Each header from the C Standard Library is included in the C++ Standard Library under a different name, generated by removing the &quot; file extension, and adding a &quot; at the start; for example, &#x27;codice_10&#x27; becomes &#x27;codice_11&#x27;. The only difference between these headers and the traditional C Standard Library headers is that where possible the functions should be placed into the codice_12 namespace. In ISO C, functions in the standard library are allowed to be implemented by macros, which is not allowed by ISO C++.

Usage of the C headers with the &quot; file extension is legal in C++ and used for compatibility.
The following headers are special C compatibility headers which do not have a corresponding C++ naming convention, meaning that the C headers &quot;must&quot; be used if the header is necessary.

The C headers codice_13 and codice_14 do not have C++ equivalents and their C headers are not supported in C++.

C++ does not provide the C POSIX library as part of any standard, however it is legal to use in a C++ program. If used in C++, the POSIX headers are not prepended with a &quot;&quot; at the beginning of the name, and all contain the suffix in the header name.

<text>Dagfinn Høybråten (born 2 December 1957) is a Norwegian politician. He was the leader of the Christian Democratic Party 2004–2011. He was also Parliamentary leader from 2005 when he was elected as Member of Parliament representing Rogaland. He was Vice President of the Norwegian Parliament from 2011 to 2013. He was President of the Nordic Council in 2007. Høybråten was granted leave from his duty as Member of Parliament from March 2013 to take up the position as Secretary General of the Nordic Council of Ministers. He was elected board member of the GAVI Alliance in 2006 and chair of the board from 2011 to 2015.

In 2018 it was announced that Mr Høybråten will lead the &quot;Truth and Reconciliation committee&quot; regarding the discrimination of the indigenous Sami people in Norway up and until 1980.

He was the chairman of the Young Christian Democrats (KrFU) in 1979–1982. Høybråten has been part of the political leadership of every Government the Christian Democratic Party has been part of since the early 1980s, first as a Political Adviser to Minister of Church and Education Kjell Magne Bondevik 1983–1986, later as State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance 1989–1990, Minister of Health 1997–2000 and 2001–2004 as well as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs 2004–2005.

Høybråten has also served as the Director General of Norway Social Security Administration 1997–2004, an executive director of the Norwegian Association of Local Government from 1990 to 1993 and a chief executive of the municipality of Oppegård 1994–1996. Høybråten holds a degree in political science from the University of Oslo.

==Early and personal life==
Høybråten was born to churchwarden and politician Per Høybråten (1932–1990) and laboratory worker Åse Margrethe Hallen (born 1929). While he was born and grew up in Oslo, he lived for three years in Sandnes due to his father working there as a control veterinary. His father was politically active in the Christian Democratic Party, and was a State Secretary and deputy member of the Parliament of Norway from Oslo 1973–1977. Høybråten is married to his wife Jorun, and has four children.

==Political career==
Høybråten became active in politics at an early age, and became deputy chairman of the Young Christian Democrats in 1978-1979 and chairman in 1979–1982. He got his first experience from Parliament as a personal assistant to Parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Party, Lars Korvald. When the Christian Democrats joined Kåre Willoch&#x27;s government in 1983 Høybråten became a Political Adviser for Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik in the Ministry of Church and Education until 1986. I Jan P. Syse&#x27;s government 1989-1990 he was State secretary in the Ministry of Finance.

He led the Ministry of Health and Care Services from 1997 to 2000 and again from 2001 to 2004. Following a 2004 Government reshuffle, Høybråten was transferred to lead the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. In 2004, he also assumed the leadership of the Christian Democratic Party.

As Minister of Health, Høybråten was noted for his campaign against tobacco smoking in public indoor places. It resulted in the adoption by Parliament of a bill banning smoking in restaurants, bars, and cafés that came into force on 1 June 2004. Several European countries followed the Norwegian experiences closely, and planned for similar legislation. Between 2004 and 2011 about 100 countries across the globe adopted a similar legislation. Høybråtens efforts have been credited for reducing the smoking rates and improving public health in Norway. Initially, the bill sparked some controversy, however it became popular after it passed. Høybråten received LHL&#x27;s honorary award in 2006 for his work in this field. Høybråten was critical of employers advertising positions for non-smokers, since his he felt the issue ought to be fighting tobacco and its adverse health effects, rather than discriminating against people who smoke.

When former leader Valgerd Svarstad Haugland and the rest of the Party leadership withdrew in 2004 after a poor result in the local elections in 2003, Høybråten was elected new party leader at an extraordinary Party Congress. He became Member of Parliament of Norway from Rogaland in 2005, and he then also became parliamentary leader for the Christian Democratic Parliamentary group. After a year in the Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs Committee he was from 2006 Member of the Committee of Foreign Affairs until he left Parliament. He was also President of the Nordic Council 2007–2008.

On 2 October 2010 Høybråten announced that he would not run for reelection as party leader at the 2011 party conference. He also announced that he would not run for a third term as member of Parliament in the 2013 general election. Knut Arild Hareide succeeded him from 30 April 2011. Høybråten was announced as the new secretary general of the Nordic Council of Ministers in September 2012 effective from 1 March 2013. He was granted a leave for the remainder of his term in parliament.

In 2016 he started to serve as board member at the Board of International Advisors at the Fudan Development Institute in Shanghai.

In March 2019 his tenure as secretary general at the Nordic Council of Ministers ended. On 1 April the same year he became secretary general of the Norwegian Church Aid.

==Gavi - the Vaccine Alliance==
Høybråten was elected board member of Gavi – the Vaccine Alliance in 2006. In the period 2011-2015 he served as chair of the Gavi Alliance Board. He succeeded Mary Robinson, Graça Machel and Nelson Mandela in this position, and he is the longest-serving chair of the organisation. Gavi was set up in 2000 as a global Vaccine Alliance, bringing together public and private sectors with the shared goal of saving children&#x27;s lives and protecting people&#x27;s health by increasing access to immunisation in the world&#x27;s poorest countries.

In 2015, new figures documented that Gavi has helped vaccinate half a billion children and saved 7 million lives since the organisation was funded. During Høybråten&#x27;s term as chair, Gavi – the Vaccine Alliance had two replenishment conferences to finance the global vaccination work. Both in London 2011 and in Berlin 2015 the donors exceeded the ask, and managed to raise respectively 4.3 and US$7.539 billion.

==Awards and decorations==

In 1999 Høybråten was appointed as honorary president of Yiang Central Hospital in the Hunan province of China. The hospital was founded in 1906 by Høybråtens great grandfather, Jørgen Edvin Nielsen. Høybråten was awarded the Grand Cross of St. Olav in 2004. In 2005 Høybråten was awarded an honorary degree from Luther College in Iowa.

<doc id="384114" wikidata="Q917195" url="?curid=384114" title="Enryaku-ji">
<text>is a Tendai monastery located on Mount Hiei in Ōtsu, overlooking Kyoto. It was first founded in 788 during the early Heian period (794–1185) by Saichō (767–822), also known as Dengyō Daishi, who introduced the Tendai sect of Mahayana Buddhism to Japan from China. The temple complex has undergone several reconstruction efforts since then, with the most significant (that of the main hall) taking place in 1642 under Tokugawa Iemitsu. Enryaku-ji is the headquarters of the Tendai sect and one of the most significant monasteries in Japanese history. As such, it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)&quot;. The founders of Jōdo-shū, , Sōtō Zen, and Nichiren Buddhism all spent time at the monastery. Enryaku-ji is also the center for the practice of kaihōgyō (aka the &quot;marathon monks&quot;).

==History==
With the support of Emperor Kanmu, the Buddhist monk Saichō ordained a hundred disciples in 807. Maintaining a strict discipline on Mt. Hiei, his monks lived in seclusion for twelve years of study and meditation. After this period, the best students were retained in positions in the monastery and others graduated into positions in the government. At the peak of its power, Enryaku-ji was a huge complex of as many as 3,000 sub-temples and a powerful army of . In the tenth century, succession disputes broke out between Tendai monks of the line of Ennin and Enchin. These disputes resulted in opposing Tendai centers at Enryaku-ji and at Mii-dera, known respectively as the and the . Warrior monks were used to settle the disputes, and Tendai leaders began to hire mercenary armies who threatened rivals and even marched on the capital to enforce monastic demands.

As part of a program to remove all potential rivals and unite the country, warlord Oda Nobunaga ended this Buddhist militancy in 1571 by attacking Enryaku-ji, leveling the buildings and slaughtering monks. Enryaku-ji&#x27;s current structures date from the late 16th century through the first half of the 17th century, when the temple was reconstructed following a change of government. Only one minor building survived, the &quot;Ruri-dō&quot; (るり堂, &quot;Lapis Lazuli Hall&quot;), which is located down a long, unmarked path from the &quot;Sai-tō&quot; complex. The structure dates to the 13th century and was repaired twice during the 20th century following harsh weather. During reconstruction, some buildings were transferred from other temples, notably Mii-dera, and thus the buildings themselves are old, though they have not always been at this location.

Today, most of Enryaku-ji&#x27;s buildings are clustered in three areas: &quot;Tō-dō&quot; (東塔, &quot;East Pagoda&quot;), &quot;Sai-tō&quot; (西塔, &quot;West Pagoda&quot;), and &quot;Yokokawa&quot; (横川). The monastery&#x27;s most important buildings are concentrated in &quot;Tō-dō&quot;. &quot;Sai-tō&quot; is a 20-minute walk away, primarily downhill from &quot;Tō-dō&quot;, and also features several important buildings. &quot;Yokokawa&quot; is more isolated and less visited, about a 1:30 walk, and is most easily reached by bus, which connects the three complexes and other locations on the mountain.

On April 4, 2006, Enryaku-ji performed a ceremony for former leaders of Yamaguchi-gumi, by far the largest yakuza organization in Japan. Because such temple ceremonies have been used for Yamaguchi-gumi fund-raising and demonstrations of power, the Shiga Prefectural Police requested that Enryaku-ji cease performance of the ceremony. Rejecting the request, Enryaku-ji received crime-related money for the ceremony and allowed nearly 100 upper-level Yamaguchi-gumi leaders to attend. After reports in the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; and &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; newspapers, Enryaku-ji faced a nationwide scandal. The temple was also criticized by the Japan Buddhist Temple Association (representing 75,000 Buddhist temples), which led a movement against the yakuza. Finally on May 18, all representative directors of Enryaku-ji resigned, apologizing on their website and in e-mails which were sent to 3,000 branch temples.

<doc id="384118" wikidata="Q430443" url="?curid=384118" title="Fernando Wood">
<text>Fernando Wood (June 14, 1812 – February 13, 1881) was an American Democratic Party politician, merchant, and real estate investor who served as the 73rd and 75th Mayor of New York City. He also represented the city for several terms in the United States House of Representatives.

After rapidly rising through Tammany Hall, Wood served a single term in the U.S. House before returning to private life and building a fortune in real estate speculation and maritime shipping.

He was elected mayor for the first time in 1854 and served three non-consecutive terms. His mayoralty was marked by an almost dictatorial vision of the office and political corruption in the city&#x27;s appointed offices, including the New York City police force. His political appointments and his advocacy for unilateral reform of the city charter to strengthen his power and grant the city home rule brought him into direct conflict with the Republican state legislature, leading to a charter revision that prematurely ended his second term in office and resulted in his arrest. He returned to the mayor&#x27;s office for a final term in 1860.

After leaving the mayor&#x27;s office, Wood was elected to several more terms in the House of Representatives, where he served for sixteen years. In his final two terms in that office, he served as chairman of the powerful House Committee on Ways and Means.

Throughout his career, Wood expressed political sympathies for the Southern United States, including during the American Civil War. He once suggested to the New York City Council that the city should declare itself an independent city-state in order to continue its profitable cotton trade with the Confederate States of America. In the House, he was a vocal opponent of President Abraham Lincoln and one of the main opponents of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States.

==Early life==
Fernando Wood was born in Philadelphia on June 14, 1812. His Spanish forename was chosen by his mother, who found it in &quot;The Three Spaniards&quot;, an English gothic novel written by George Walker.

His father, Benjamin Wood, was a speculator in dry goods who was bankrupted by the Panic of 1819. His mother, Rebecca (née Lehman) Wood, was the daughter of a recent immigrant from Hamburg who had been wounded at the Battle of Yorktown.

Fernando had six siblings: four brothers and two sisters. His brother, named Benjamin Wood after their father, also served in the U.S. Congress. Throughout Fernando Wood&#x27;s career, Benjamin was his sole trusted ally.

During Fernando&#x27;s childhood, his father moved the family frequently: from Philadelphia to Shelbyville, Kentucky; New Orleans; Havana, Cuba; Charleston, South Carolina; and finally New York City, where he opened a tobacconist store in 1821. The business failed by 1829 and Benjamin Wood left for Charleston, where he died two years later, impoverished and alone.

In New York, Fernando enrolled in a private academy run by James Shea of Columbia College. He was educated in grammar, rhetoric, and mathematics. He left school in 1825 at age 13, as his father&#x27;s business declined, in order to provide for his family. For six years, he worked throughout the Eastern United States in a variety of low-paying jobs, including as a stage actor. In 1831, he married his first wife, Anna W. Taylor, the 16-year old daughter of a Philadelphia merchant.

In 1832, Wood returned to New York City to head his mother&#x27;s household at 140 Greene Street. He struggled in business, often working nights at his wife&#x27;s wine and tobacconist store on Pearl Street. In 1835, Wood started a ship chandler firm with Francis Secor and Joseph Scoville, but the business failed during the Panic of 1837. He soon opened a bar using his wife&#x27;s dowry, which he was forced to close because business was so poor. In later years, after parting ways politically, Scoville accused Wood of overcharging drunken bar patrons.

==Rise through Tammany Hall==
Despite his business failures, Wood was successful in politics. He joined the nascent Jacksonian Democratic Party, possibly influenced by his hatred of the Second Bank of the United States, which he blamed for his father&#x27;s ruin. In 1836, party leaders elevated him to membership in the fraternal-political Tammany Society, the first rung on the New York Democratic ladder.

Tammany Hall was split between moderates, including Wood, and a breakaway faction of radicals known as Locofocos. When the Locofocos formed an independent Equal Rights Party, Wood remained in the Tammany organization, gaining promotion into the organization&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Committee and becoming its organizing force. However, following the Panic of 1837 and a Locofoco food riot, Wood worked to advance radical anti-bank politics within the Young Men&#x27;s Committee. Wood&#x27;s move was politically prescient; in September 1837, President Martin Van Buren, a Tammany Hall ally, signaled approval of Locofocoism. At a meeting later that month, the general Tammany organization voted in favor of Wood&#x27;s motion to oust the Bank Democrats from the organization. Wood received a host of organization promotions.

==U.S. Representative (1841–43)==

===1840 election===
In October 1840, Wood&#x27;s rise culminated with a nomination for the United States House of Representatives at just 28 years old. At this time, New York City elected its four members of the House on a single ticket. Wood campaigned on Anglophobic themes to appeal to Irish voters in the city, suggesting that &quot;British stockjobbers&quot; funded the Whig campaign in gold. He engaged in a war of words with &quot;New York American&quot; editor Charles King, who revealed that Wood had been found liable for $2,143.90 in overdraft fees after he fraudulently withdrew from his bank on the basis of a bookkeeping error.

In response, Wood published the statements of two of the referees in his case, a letter from the bank&#x27;s Whig attorney, and a letter from his own attorney, which Wood combined to argue the bank had maligned him to help the Whig Party.

Wood and his Democratic running mates unseated the incumbent Whig ticket, though Wood received the fewest votes and only won his seat by 886 votes. The bank scandal remained a sore spot for Wood for years.

===27th Congress===

In Congress, Wood served on the Public Buildings and Grounds Committee. He sought out the mentorship of Henry Clay, who had become estranged from the Whigs over his break with President John Tyler, and Southern Democrats like John C. Calhoun, Henry A. Wise, and James K. Polk. Wood&#x27;s voting record was markedly pro-Southern and pro-slavery, more so than any other New York congressman.

On economic issues, Wood was an orthodox Democrat, favoring hard money, deflation, and free trade. However, he supported federal funding in New York, including appropriations for harbor improvements, fortifications, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Wood was also a staunch backer of federal subsidies for Samuel F.B. Morse&#x27;s experimental telegraph. He was a vocal opponent of protectionist tariffs proposed by House Ways and Means chairman Millard Fillmore.

Wood also lobbied the U.S. State Department for protections for Irish political prisoners, some of whom were naturalized Americans, whom the British forcibly resettled on Tasmania.

====1842 election====
Wood expected to run for re-election in 1842, but the New York City district was split into four separate districts by a congressional mandate.

Wood lived in the new fifth district, also home to popular incumbent John McKeon. To avoid facing McKeon in a primary, Wood relocated to a strong Whig district, the sixth, where instead he faced incumbent James I. Roosevelt and former Congressman Ely Moore for the Democratic nomination. After Roosevelt withdrew, Wood won a one-vote plurality in the primary, but fell short of the required majority. Moore withdrew in favor of McKeon, who had lost the nomination in his original district. McKeon won, and Wood covertly undermined him in the general election, invoking McKeon&#x27;s Irish heritage and suggesting McKeon was a secret abolitionist. McKeon lost to Whig Hamilton Fish.

==Return to business==

In need of funds and expecting his first child, Wood left politics after 1842 to reopen his ship chandler firm on the East River, announcing to his friends that he was &quot;entirely out of politics.&quot;

To accrue necessary capital, Wood begged Henry A. Wise for a patronage appointment as the State Department&#x27;s local despatch agent, despite previously having tried to abolish the role when he was a congressman. Though Secretary of State Abel Upshur refused, he was soon killed in an accident aboard the USS &quot;Princeton&quot; and succeeded by John C. Calhoun, who granted Wood the appointment on May 8, 1844.

With his government job as a subsidy and political power base, Wood expanded his business and rented a new home in upper Manhattan with three servants. Except for his efforts on behalf of presidential nominee James K. Polk and in defense of his own patronage position, he remained largely outside politics.

===1844 presidential election===

In advance of the 1844 Democratic National Convention, which was expected to be a showdown between Calhoun and Martin Van Buren, Wood acted as a double agent on behalf of Van Buren. Calhoun supporters, seeking to peel Tammany away from Van Buren, invited Wood to strategy meetings and sought his advice on courting New York delegates. However, Wood covertly passed this information to Van Buren. Though Calhoun never found Wood out, the affair left Van Buren suspicious of Wood&#x27;s character and the former President&#x27;s son, John Van Buren, became Wood&#x27;s political rival for the next two decades.

After the nomination went to dark horse James K. Polk, Wood renewed their friendship and launched into a campaign for Polk in New York City, New Jersey, and the Southern Tier. Wood used his political connections to Polk to save his patronage job under new Secretary of State James Buchanan.

===Real estate===
Wood massively expanded his wealth by entering the real estate market, at first by accident. In 1848, using his second wife&#x27;s modest fortune, he took out a $4,000 (~$ in ) mortgage on a 150 acre plot on Bloomingdale Road. As New York&#x27;s population boomed and development hastened, real estate values skyrocketed. Along with subsequent purchases from the same estate, Wood accumulated a property worth over $650,000. Using this property as security, he engaged in a series of successful purchases in nearly every ward of Manhattan. William Tweed later said of Wood, &quot;I never yet went to get a corner lot that I didn&#x27;t find Wood had got in ahead of me.&quot;

In 1852, Wood expanded his holdings to San Francisco. By 1855, his growing fortune was estimated at $200,000; in 1861, $500,000. Wood himself reported personal holdings of $1,200,000 at the 1860 census ($ in dollars).

===Gold Rush and &quot;Cater&quot; affair===
In October 1848, in the early stages of the California Gold Rush, Wood and four other partners chartered a barque, the &quot;John C. Cater&quot;, to sell goods and equipment in San Francisco. The goods were sold at inflated prices, and the &quot;Cater&quot; maintained a profitable trade transporting passengers and lumber between Oregon and San Francisco.

It was later discovered that Wood defrauded his brother-in-law, Edward E. Marvine, in order to obtain the necessary start-up capital for the &quot;Cater&quot;. Wood presented his brother-in-law with a fraudulent letter, purportedly from a &quot;Thomas O&#x27;Larkin&quot; in Monterey, California, suggesting the venture. Marvine was convinced by this letter and convinced three more investors to join. Marvine later sued Wood for $20,000 in fraud. In 1851, Wood was indicted by a grand jury, but the judges quashed the charges because the statute of limitations expired a day before the court was to rule on the matter. Wood was accused, without substantiation, of bribing the Whig district attorney with $700 to delay the charges until the statute of limitations expired. In 1855, the New York Supreme Court ordered Wood to pay Marvine $8,000 and the other partners $5,635.40. Wood filed an appeal that dragged on for another six years.

During the case, Wood maintained his innocence and brought a libel suit against the &quot;New York Sun&quot; for prematurely printing details of Marvine&#x27;s deposition.

==Mayor of New York City==

In the words of biographer Jerome Mushkat, Mayor Wood was &quot;a unique figure, New York&#x27;s first modern mayor, a city builder, and the prototype for later municipal leaders, a man who anticipated much of what became the urban Progressive Movement.&quot; His mayoralty was marked by his push for home rule and charter reform, as well as accusations of corruption in city government by his opponents.

Wood was the first New York City mayor linked to Tammany Hall.

===1850 campaign===

Wood was nominated for Mayor of New York City for the first time in 1850 with the support of &quot;Soft Shell Democrats&quot; who supported the 1849 state Democratic platform, which called for protection of slavery where it existed but recognized Congress&#x27;s right to prevent its extension to new American territories. He was defeated by Ambrose C. Kingsland in a landslide for the Whig Party.

===1854 campaign===
Wood began organizing his political return in November 1853, courting both the Soft and Hard factions in opposition to Free Soil Democrats, who opposed any extension of slavery whatsoever. He also sought influence in the secretive new Know-Nothing nativist movement, despite his base of support in the city&#x27;s immigrant communities.

Wood was easily nominated for a second time, though a faction of Hard Democrats nominated Wilson J. Hunt. Wood&#x27;s campaign was nearly upended by his Know-Nothing involvement, but he survived the accusations to win with just 33.6% of the vote.

===First term (1855–56)===
In his first two-year term, Wood sought to strengthen the office of mayor and establish &quot;one-man rule&quot; in advance of proposals to unilaterally modernize the city&#x27;s economy, improve its public works, and reduce wealth inequality.

He was very popular in New York and throughout the country, and gained the nickname &quot;the Model Mayor.&quot;
However, his attempts at reform were quickly overshadowed by failure to answer accusations of corruption in his handling of the police force. His political base was eroded entirely in the 1855 elections, leaving Wood on the defensive for the remainder of his term. Nonetheless, his vision for the mayoralty as a powerful central executive and his campaign for greater home rule for New York City came to define the city&#x27;s politics for generations.

He embarked on several large spending programs, including modernizing the city&#x27;s wharfs by replacing wooden structures with stone, new safety features for the city&#x27;s railways, construction of the already-planned Central Park, and expansion of the city&#x27;s grid plan. Attempts to crack down on vice were largely abandoned for political and practical reasons.

===1856 gubernatorial campaign and re-election===
Wood was an early supporter of James Buchanan for the 1856 Democratic nomination and attempted to parlay this support into a nomination on Buchanan&#x27;s ticket for Governor of New York. However, an expected endorsement by Buchanan never materialized and Wood was seen as too extreme by state leaders. Both the Hard and Soft factions unified on the candidacy of Amasa J. Parker, who ultimately lost the election.

Instead, Wood stood for re-election as mayor on a platform of charter reform, in defiance of a one-term tradition. The general election campaign was marked by personal attacks and street violence committed by the various political gangs in the city. On election day, Wood furloughed or relieved many police officers of duty, allowing his own gang, the Dead Rabbits, to menace voters and steal ballot boxes. He won the race with 44.6% of the vote, though he trailed Buchanan by a wide margin due to fractures in the city party. Despite his evident abuse of police powers and encouragement of violence, a grand jury declined to indict Wood on the grounds that such practices were common in the city&#x27;s history and at the time.

===Second term (1857)===

In Wood&#x27;s second term, his control over Tammany Hall unraveled and his handling of the police force boiled over in the New York City Police riot and Dead Rabbits riot.

In April, the Republican legislature passed a new City Charter which truncated Wood&#x27;s current term to one year, a Police Reform Act dissolving Wood&#x27;s Municipal police in favor of a Metropolitan state unit, and an Excise Act implementing restrictive liquor licensing throughout the state. Wood committed himself to resisting the Police Reform Act and maintaining his own Municipal police, culminating in a police riot and Wood&#x27;s orchestrated arrest on June 16.

===1857 election===
In the December 1857 election, Tammany joined with Republicans and Know-Nothings in endorsing Daniel F. Tiemann over Wood. The economic devastation of the Panic of 1857 dominated the campaign, and Wood pursued public works programs to provide jobs and food for the city&#x27;s poor citizens.

Wood was denied a third successive term by a narrow margin of 3,000 votes.

===Return to mayoralty and support for Confederacy===

Wood served a third mayoral term in 1860 and 1861. Wood was one of many New York Democrats sympathetic to the Confederacy, called &#x27;Copperheads&#x27; by the staunch Unionists. In 1860, at a meeting to choose New York&#x27;s delegates to the Democratic convention in Charleston, S.C., Wood outlined his case against the abolitionist cause and the &quot;Black Republicans&quot; who supported it. He was of the opinion that &quot;until we have provided and cared for the oppressed laboring man in our own midst, we should not extend our sympathy to the laboring men of other States.&quot; In January 1861, Wood suggested to the New York City Council that New York secede and declare itself a free city in order to continue its profitable cotton trade with the Confederacy.

Wood&#x27;s Democratic machine was concerned with maintaining the revenues that maintained the patronage, which depended on Southern cotton. Wood&#x27;s suggestion was greeted with derision by the Common Council. Tammany Hall was highly factionalized until after the Civil War. Wood and his faction cocreated and he headed his own organization named Mozart Hall. New York City commercial interests wanted to retain their relations with the South, but within the framework of the Constitution.

==Return to U.S. House==
Subsequent to serving his third mayoral term, Wood served again in the House of Representatives from 1863 to 1865, then again from 1867 until his death in Hot Springs, Arkansas on February 13, 1881.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
Wood was one of the main opponents of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which abolished slavery and was critical in blocking the measure in the House when it first came up for a vote in June 1864. Wood attacked anti-slavery War Democrats as having &quot;a white man&#x27;s face on the body of a negro,&quot; and supported state-level Democratic Party platforms that advocated constitutional amendments protecting slavery. He argued that the amendment &quot;strikes at property,&quot; and took the power of regulating slavery away from the states, where it rightfully belonged.

On January 15, 1868, Wood was censured for the use of unparliamentary language. During debate on the floor the House of Representatives, Wood called a piece of legislation &quot;A monstrosity, a measure the most infamous of the many infamous acts of this infamous Congress.&quot; An uproar immediately followed this utterance, and Wood was not permitted to continue. This was followed by a motion by Henry L. Dawes to censure Wood, which passed by a vote of 114-39.

Notwithstanding his censure, Wood still managed to defeat Dr. Francis Thomas, the Republican candidate, by a narrow margin in the election of that year.

Wood served as chairman for the Committee on Ways and Means in both the 45th and 46th Congress (1877–1881).

==Personal life==

===Personality and appearance===

Wood was slightly over six feet, making him tall for his time. Contemporaries described him as &quot;strikingly handsome,&quot; but he dressed plainly and showed little emotion.

Wood&#x27;s biographer Jerome Mushkat describes him as a totally self-reliant man of &quot;soaring ambition&quot; and &quot;an almost dictatorial obsession to control men and events.&quot;

===Marriages and family===
Wood&#x27;s brother Benjamin Wood purchased the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; (not to be confused with the current &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, which was founded in 1919), supported Stephen A. Douglas, and was elected to Congress, where he made a name as an opponent of pursuing the American Civil War.

Wood was married three times and had 16 children, seven from his second marriage to Anna Richardson and nine from his third marriage to Alice Mills. Among his children with Mills were Henry Alexander Wise Wood.

His first marriage (1831–39) to Anna Taylor of Philadelphia ended in divorce upon Wood&#x27;s discovery of her frequent adultery. Their marriage was childless and a court decreed that Anna could not marry again during Wood&#x27;s lifetime. He never spoke of her again, but a political enemy later claimed she had become an alcoholic prostitute.

In 1841 he married Anna Dole Richardson, who died in 1859. Anna was a direct descendant of William Penn through her mother, and her father, Judge Joseph L. Richardson, was well-connected with upstate politicians including President Van Buren, Silas Wright, and William C. Bouck. During his second marriage, having built a second fortune, Wood and his wife joined the Protestant Episcopal Church.

In 1860 he married Alice Fenner Mills, the 16-year-old daughter of retired Republican financier and railroad executive C. Drake Mills.

===Ancestry===
The Wood family traces its lineage in America to around 1670, when Henry Wood, a carpenter and Quaker, migrated from Wales to Newport, Rhode Island. He later moved his family to West Jersey, where he established a homestead along the Delaware River.

Fernando Wood&#x27;s grandfather Henry Wood was born in 1758 and served in the American Revolution as a captain. He was wounded at the battles of Germantown and Yorktown.

Little is known about Wood&#x27;s maternal line.

==Death and legacy==
Wood died in Hot Springs, Arkansas on February 13, 1881, one day before his 69th birthday. He was buried in Trinity Church Cemetery, in New York, N.Y.

In Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln&quot;, Wood is portrayed by Lee Pace as a leading opponent of the president and of the Thirteenth Amendment.

<text>L. E. (Leland Exton) Modesitt Jr. (; born 1943) is an American science fiction and fantasy author who has written over 80 novels. He is best known for the fantasy series &quot;The Saga of Recluce&quot;. By 2015, the 18 novels in the &quot;Recluce&quot; series had sold nearly three million copies. By 2019, there were 22 Recluce novels.

In addition to his novels, Modesitt has published technical studies and articles, columns, poetry, and a number of science fiction stories. His first short story, &quot;The Great American Economy&quot;, was published in 1973 in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact&quot;. In 2008, he published his first collection of short stories, &quot;Viewpoints Critical: Selected Stories&quot; (Tor Books, 2008).

Modesitt was the Writer Guest of Honor at Balticon 58, held from May 24 to 27, 2024.

==Early life==
Modesitt was born in Denver, Colorado. He graduated from Williams College in Massachusetts and lived in Washington, D.C. for almost 20 years while working as a political writer.

He has worked as a Navy pilot, lifeguard, delivery boy, unpaid radio disc jockey, real estate agent, market research analyst, director of research for a political campaign, legislative assistant for a Congressman, staff director for another, Director of Legislation and Congressional Relations for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, a consultant on environmental, regulatory, and communications issues, and a college lecturer and writer in residence.

==Approach to writing==
Modesitt has stated, &quot;When all the research, all the writing group support, all the cheerleading, and all the angst fade away, and they should, the bottom line is simple: As a writer, you first must entertain your readers. To keep them beyond a quick and final read, you have to do more than that, whether it&#x27;s to educate them, make them feel, anger them by challenging their preconceptions—or all of that and more. But if you don&#x27;t entertain first, none of what else you do matters, because they won&#x27;t stay around.&quot;

<text>On2 TrueMotion VP6 is a proprietary lossy video compression format and video codec. It is an incarnation of the TrueMotion video codec, a series of video codecs developed by On2 Technologies. This codec is commonly used by Adobe Flash, Flash Video, and JavaFX media files.

== Overview ==
The VP6 codec was introduced in May 2003. In October 2003, On2 officially released its TrueMotion VP6 codec.

In November 2003, On2 announced that VP6 had been chosen as a codec for China&#x27;s Enhanced Versatile Disc (EVD), a competitor format to DVD. Beijing-based company E-World was to be the exclusive reseller of the EVD VP6 technology in China, with On2 Technologies earning royalty payments of about $2 USD per player. Then in April 2004 On2 announced that negotiations with E-World had broken down and that On2 would file multiple breach of contract claims against E-World in arbitration proceedings. In March 2005, On2 announced that the arbitrator had dismissed all of On2&#x27;s claims and had decided that E-World owed nothing to On2. Although E-World included VP6 to its EVD standardization proposal to the Chinese government, it is not clear what, if any, action was then taken by the government. The EVD format initiative appears to be indefinitely stalled.

In November 2003, On2 announced that the VP6 codec will be used in products for broadcasting in the field, such as with BBC reporters and QuickLink software.

In January 2005, On2 announced a new VP7 codec with better compression capabilities than VP6.

In April 2005, On2 Technologies licensed On2 Video Codec (including VP6 and VP7) for Macromedia Flash. In August 2005, Macromedia announced they had selected VP6 as the flagship new codec for video playback in the new Flash Player 8.

In March 2006, a VP6 decoder (libvp62) appeared as an open-source project, but was driven underground by On2 on copyright infringement claims.

As of September 2006, an open-source implementation of the decoder is part of the libavcodec project. VP6 decoder is part of stable version FFmpeg 0.5, released in March 2009. There are some claims that producing or dealing with VP6 video streams inside libavcodec/libavformat is discouraged and/or refused due to clashes between the FFmpeg&#x27;s developers and On2 technologies by a claim of Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets Infringement made by the corporation itself.

In May 2008, Sun Microsystems announced it had licensed On2 TrueMotion codecs to add video capabilities to JavaFX, a family of products for creating Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) across Mobile, Desktop, TV and more. JavaFX uses On2 VP6.

Later incarnations of this codec are VP7, VP8 and VP9. With the Google acquisition of On2, VP8 is licensed as open source. Earlier versions such as VP6 remain unsupported.

<doc id="384141" wikidata="Q23089" url="?curid=384141" title="Do Bigha Zamin">
<text> ( ) is a 1953 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by Bimal Roy. Based on Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s Bengali poem &quot;Dui Bigha Jomi&quot; and &quot;Rickshawalla&quot;, a short story written by composer Salil Chowdhury, the film stars Balraj Sahni and Nirupa Roy in lead roles. Known for its socialist theme, &quot;Do Bigha Zamin&quot; is considered an important film in the early parallel cinema of India, and a trend setter.

Inspired by Italian neo-realistic cinema, Bimal Roy made &quot;Do Bigha Zamin&quot; after watching Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (1948). Like most of Bimal Roy&#x27;s movies, art and commercial cinema merge to create a movie that is still viewed as a benchmark. It has paved the way for future cinema makers in the Indian neo-realist movement and the Indian New Wave, which began in the 1950s.

A moderate commercial success, it was awarded the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film, it became the first film to win the Filmfare Best Movie Award and the first Indian film to win the International Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, after &quot;Neecha Nagar&quot; (1946), which won the Palme d&#x27;Or (Grand Prize). It was also winner of the Social Progress Award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. In 2005, &quot;Indiatimes Movies&quot; ranked the movie amongst the &quot;Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films&quot;. The film was also released in China and in USSR.

The film also marks Meena Kumari&#x27;s maiden guest appearance in her 33-year-long career. The lullaby, &quot;Aa Jaa Ri Aa&quot; is picturised on her.

== Plot ==
The story revolves around a farmer, Shambhu Maheto, who lives with his wife Parvati, son Kanhaiya and father Gangu in a small village that is hit by drought. After years of drought and famine, the region finally gets rain, leading the farmers to rejoice. Shambhu owns two bighas of land (a bigha being the equivalent of two-thirds of an acre of land), which is the only means of livelihood for the whole family. The local landlord Thakur Harnam Singh partners with some businessmen to construct a mill on his large parcel of land, which in return, he opines, would bring them profit and prosperity to the village. The only problem is that in the middle of Harnam Singh&#x27;s land lies Shambhu&#x27;s meager two bighas of land.

Harnam Singh is very confident that he can buy Shambhu&#x27;s land. Shambhu has borrowed money from Harnam Singh several times in the past and has not paid off his debt. Harnam Singh calls for Shambhu and proposes to Shambhu to sell his land to him in exchange for his debt. Shambhu disagrees to sell his only means of livelihood. Angered by the refusal, Harnam Singh orders him to repay his debt by the next day or risk the auctioning of his land.

Shambhu returns home to discuss the issue with his father; father and son figure that the debt amounts to Rs. 65/-. Shambu wants to save his land by all means and sells all his household items, including his wife&#x27;s gold earrings. When Shambhu meets Harnam Singh&#x27;s accountant to pay back his debt of Rs. 65/-, he is shocked to know that he actually owes Rs. 235/-. The accountant had fudged the accounts and now refuses to consider the labor provided by Shambhu&#x27;s father Gangu as a portion of the debt payoff. The case goes to court and Shambhu, being illiterate, has a tough time explaining to the judge how the accountant fudged the numbers and how he took the accountant&#x27;s word and did not demand any receipt. Shambhu loses the case and the judge orders Shambu to pay Rs. 235/- to Harnam Singh in 3 months. If Shambhu is not able to clear the debt, then his land would be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to pay off his debts.

Shambhu now struggles to get the money. He is unable to get a loan because he has no collateral. One of his friends gives him an idea to go to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and try to get a job to earn enough money to pay off his debt. Shambhu likes this idea but faces resistance from his wife as she is pregnant and does not want to live away from him. Shambhu persuades her that he&#x27;ll be gone for only 3 months and it would benefit his family and the soon-to-be-born baby. Kanhaiya wants to join his father too, but Shambhu refuses and scolds him. On the train to Calcutta, Shambhu finds Kanhaiya hiding in it, hitchhiking or as a stowaway, and after a brief confrontation agrees to take Kanhaiya with him.

In Calcutta, Shambhu and Kanhaiya have a harsh welcome. Nobody is willing to talk with them, let alone help them. Kanhaiya befriends a street-side shoe-shiner named Lalu Ustad. They even lose their last possessions while they are asleep on the footpath. Kanhaiya falls ill and Shambhu ends up renting a small room in the slums with the help of a tea vendor and the landlady&#x27;s adopted grandchild, Rani. To pay the rent, Shambhu works as a coolie. Shambhu befriends an old Rickshaw Puller, who helps him get a license as a Rickshaw Puller. Kanhaiya tries to help his family by taking up shoe-shining with the help of the old Rickshaw Puller and Lalu. Back in the village, Parvati and Gangu survive on eating water chestnuts picked from the local river. She seeks help from Thakurain to write letters to Shambhu and stay in touch.

Near the end of the third month, Shambhu becomes desperate about earning and saving money. One day, a man asks Shambhu to chase another rickshaw that is carrying his girlfriend. Shambhu is asked to pull the rickshaw very fast for more money. The rickshaw loses a wheel and Shambhu meets with an accident. Looking at the condition of his father, Kanhaiya joins a pickpocket to earn quick money. Shambhu gets angry upon learning this and beats Kanhaiya. Meanwhile, Parvati gets worried since she receives no letters or money from Shambhu and the landlord&#x27;s accountant accuses Shambhu of forgetting his family. She ends up working at a local construction site and is devastated when she receives news of Shambhu&#x27;s accident. Finally, Parvati decides to visit Shambhu in the city even though Gangu is bedridden and has a high fever.

Parvati arrives in Calcutta and is taken in by a strange man, who claims he knows Shambhu and will take her to him. He takes her to his shed and tries to steal her belongings and rape her. She flees from him but gets hit by a car. A crowd gathers around her and they call for a rickshaw to take her to the hospital. Shambhu, who is passing by, offers a ride and is shocked to see that it is his own wife injured. Meanwhile, Kanhaiya, unable to withstand his father&#x27;s condition, steals money from a lady and runs back to the slum. He learns of his mother&#x27;s condition and rushes to the hospital. He cries after seeing his injured mother and claims that God has punished them because he stole money. He rips the money into pieces. The doctors tell Shambhu that he has to spend money on medicine and blood to save his wife. Poor Shambhu has no choice but to spend all his earnings to save his wife.

Back in the village, the land is auctioned because Shambhu could not pay back the debt and Gangu becomes insane. The land, now owned by Harman Singh, sees the beginning of mill construction. Shambhu and his family return to the village, only to see their land sold and a factory being constructed on it. He then tries to get a handful of dirt from his land but is stopped by a security guard. The film ends as Shambhu and his family walk away from their former land.

== Production ==
In 1952, at the first International Film Festival in Mumbai, director Bimal Roy saw Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s 1948 Italian film &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (1954). In the train while he was returning home, he decided to make his next film as real as the film and shot on location. His wife, Manobina Roy, recalled her excited husband instructing his unit to come up with a story right after the screening. The film was based on &quot;Rickshawalla&quot;, a short story written by composer Salil Chowdhury. It revolved around a farmer who desperately pounds the streets of Kolkata to earn the Rs 235 needed to save his two acres of land, only to lose it to the industrialisation. Chowdhury agreed to Roy taking his idea, but on the condition that he would score the music.

Initially Roy had planned to cast Paidi Jairaj, Trilok Kapoor and Nazir Hussain in the lead, then he saw the performance of Balraj Sahni in &quot;Hum Log&quot; (1951) and decided to cast him. This decision of Roy was criticised by his team as Sahni had mostly done rich roles. To better prepare for the role, Balraj Sahni actually rehearsed for the role by pulling a rickshaw on the streets of Calcutta. He interacted with many rickshaw pullers and some of them were facing the same situation as portrayed in the movie. Actress Nirupa Roy had mostly done the role of Hindu goddess in several mythological films till that time. She was cast in the role of Parvati. She wept in real for her scenes in the film, saying, &quot;this is the first film I didn&#x27;t use glycerine for tears.&quot;

The films title is derived from a famous poem by Rabindranath Tagore, called &quot;Dui Bigha Jomi&quot;. Bimal Roy distributed the film abroad with the name &quot;Calcutta – The Cruel City&quot;. The measurement of Bigha varies from state to state. In Bengal, where the movie is based, 3 bigha is one acre (4,000 m2). Roy filmed &quot;Parineeta&quot; (1953) and at the same time in Kolkata. Hrishikesh Mukherjee was the film&#x27;s editor and scenario writer. He asked Meena Kumari if she&#x27;d do a cameo in the film, on which she agreed after seeing the stills of the film.

== Songs ==
The music for the film was composed by Salil Chowdhury, with lyrics written by Shailendra. In an interview with All India Radio, Chowdhury described the tune for &quot;Apni Kahani Chod Ja – Dharti kahe pukaar ke&quot; having been inspired by a Red Army march song as well as influenced by Bhairavi (hence the added stanza and Aalap at the beginning of the song), thus giving it a Komal Gandhara (Ga) lilt to make it softer.

<text>Foreign workers or guest workers are people who work in a country other than one of which they are a citizen. Some foreign workers use a guest worker program in a country with more preferred job prospects than in their home country. Guest workers are often either sent or invited to work outside their home country or have acquired a job before leaving their home country, whereas migrant workers often leave their home country without a specific job in prospect.

Tens of millions of people around the world operate as foreign workers. As of 2018, according to reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there is an estimated 28 million foreign-born workers in the United States, which draws most of its immigrants from Mexico, including 4 or 5 million undocumented workers. In 2016, over 15 million foreign workers lived in the European Union, half a million in Japan, and around 5 million in Saudi Arabia. Between January and June in 2019, 2.4 million foreigners arrived to work in Russia.
A comparable number of dependents may accompany international workers.

Some foreign workers migrate from former colonies to a former colonial metropole (France, for example).
Chain migration may operate in building guest-worker communities.

== Foreign workers by country or broader region ==

=== Canada ===

Foreign nationals are permitted to enter Canada on a temporary basis if they have a student visa, are seeking asylum, or possess special permits. The largest category, however, is called the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), under which workers are brought to Canada by their employers for specific jobs. In 2000, the Immigrant Workers Centre was founded in Montreal, Québec. In 2006, 265,000 foreign workers worked in Canada. Amongst those of working age, there was a 118% increase from 1996. By 2008, the intake of non-permanent immigrants (399,523, the majority of whom are TFWs) had overtaken the intake of permanent immigrants (247,243). To hire foreign workers, Canadian employers must complete a Labour Market Impact Assessment administered by Employment and Social Development Canada.

===United States===

The United States issues a number of employment-based immigrant visas. These include the H-1B visa to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations temporarily and the H-2A visa for temporary agricultural work.

Over one million undocumented immigrants work in agriculture in the United States, while roughly 250,000 are admitted under the H-2A visa, as of 2019.

Green card workers are individuals who have requested and received legal permanent residence from the government in the United States and intend to work in the United States permanently. The United States’ Diversity Immigrant Visa Lottery program authorises up to 50,000 immigrant visas to be granted each year. This help facilitates foreign nationals with low rates of immigration to the United States a chance to participate in a random drawing for the possibility of obtaining an immigration visa.

===Germany===
In Nazi Germany, from 1940 to 1942, Organization Todt began its reliance on guest workers, military internees, Zivilarbeiter (civilian workers), Ostarbeiter (Eastern workers) and Hilfswillige (&quot;volunteer&quot;) POW workers.

The significant migration phase of labour migrants in the 20th century began in Germany during the 1950s, as the sovereign Germany, since 1955 after repeated pressure from NATO partners, has yielded to the request for closure of the so-called &#x27;Anwerbe&#x27; Agreement (German: Anwerbeabkommen).
The initial plan was a rotation principle: a temporary stay (usually two to three years), followed by returning to their homeland. The rotation principle proved inefficient for the industry because inexperienced ones constantly replaced experienced workers. The companies asked for legislation to extend the residence permits.
Many foreign workers were followed by their families in the following period and stayed. Until the 1970s, more than four million migrant workers and their families thus came to Germany, mainly from the Mediterranean countries of Italy, Greece, the former Yugoslavia and Turkey.

Since about 1990, the disintegration of the Soviet bloc and the enlargement of the European Union allowed guest workers from Eastern Europe to Western Europe.

Some host countries set up a program to invite guest workers, as did the West Germany from 1955 to 1973, when over one million guest workers (German: Gastarbeiter) arrived, mostly from Turkey.

===Switzerland===

The underestimation of the required integration services by the state and the host countries&#x27; society and by the migrants themselves. Switzerland&#x27;s transformation into a country of immigration was not until after the accelerated industrialization in the second half of the 19th century. Switzerland was no longer a purely rural Alpine area but became a European vanguard in various industries at that time, first of textile, later also the mechanical and chemical industries. Since the middle of the 19th century, mainly German academics, self-employed and craftsmen, but also Italians, who found a job in science, industry, construction and infrastructure construction migrated to Switzerland.

===Asia-Pacific===
In Asia, some countries in South and Southeast Asia offer workers. Their destinations include Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia. A 2020 Greenpeace investigation found significant evidence for the abuse of foreign laborers in the Taiwanese distant water fishing industry. Taiwanese conglomerate FCF was specifically singled out for links to illegal fishing and forced labor. 
=== Middle East ===

In 1973, an oil boom in the Persian Gulf region (UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain, which comprise the Gulf Cooperation Council), created an unprecedented demand for labour in the oil, construction and industrial sectors. Development demanded a labor force. This demand was met by foreign workers, primarily those from the Arab states, with a later shift to those from Asia-Pacific countries. A rise in the standards of living for citizens of western Asian countries also created a demand for domestic workers in the home.

Since the 1970s, foreign workers have become a large percentage of the population in most nations in the Persian Gulf region. Growing competition with nationals in the job sector, along with complaints regarding the treatment of foreign workers, has led to rising tensions between the national and foreign populations in these nations.

Remittances are becoming a prominent source of external funding for countries that contribute foreign workers to the GCC countries. On average, the top recipients globally are India, the Philippines, and Bangladesh. In 2001, $72.3 billion was returned as remittances to the countries of origin of foreign workers, equivalent to 1.3% of the world GDP. The source of income remains beneficial as remittances are often more stable than private capital flows. Despite fluctuations in the economy of GCC countries, the amount of dollars in remittances is usually stable.

The spending of remittances is seen in two ways. Principally, remittances are sent to the families of guest workers. Though often put towards consumption, remittances are also directed to investment. Investment is seen to lead to the strengthening of infrastructure and facilitating international travel.

With this jump in earnings, one benefit that has been seen is the nutritional improvement in households of migrant workers. Other benefits are the lessening of underemployment and unemployment.

In detailed studies of Pakistani migrants to the West Asia in the early 1980s, the average foreign worker was 25–40 years old. Seventy per cent were married, while families accompanied only 4 per cent. Two-thirds hailed from rural areas, and 83 per cent were production workers. At the time, 40 per cent of Pakistan&#x27;s foreign exchange earnings came from its migrant workers.

Domestic work is the single most important category of employment among women migrants to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf and Lebanon and Jordan. The increase of Arab women in the labour force, and changing conceptions of women&#x27;s responsibilities, have resulted in a shift in household responsibilities to hired domestic workers. Domestic workers perform an array of work in the home: cleaning, cooking, child care, and eldercare. Common work traits include an average 100-hour work week and virtually non-existent overtime pay. Remuneration differs greatly according to nationality, oftentimes depending on language skills and education level. This is seen with Filipina domestic workers receiving a higher remuneration than Sri Lankan and Ethiopian nationals.

Saudi Arabia is the largest source of remittance payments in the world. Similar to other GCC countries, remittance payments from Saudi Arabia rose during the oil boom years of the 1970s and early 1980s but declined in the mid-1980s. As oil prices fell, budget deficits mounted, and most governments of GCC countries put limits on hiring foreign workers. Weaknesses in the financial sector and government administration impose substantial transaction costs on migrant workers who send them. Although difficult to estimate, costs consist of salaries and the increased spending required to expand educational and health services, housing, roads, communications, and other infrastructure to accommodate the basic needs of the newcomers. The foreign labour force is a substantial drain of the GCC states&#x27; hard currency earnings, with remittances to migrants&#x27; home countries in the early 2000s amounting to $27 billion per year, including $16 billion from Saudi Arabia alone. It has been shown that the percentage of the GDP that foreign labour generates is roughly equal to what the state has to spend on them.

The main concerns of developed countries regarding immigration centres are: (1) the local job seekers&#x27; fear of competition from migrant workers, (2) the fiscal burden that may result on native taxpayers for providing health and social services to migrants, (3) fears of erosion of cultural identity and problems of assimilation of immigrants, and (4) national security.

In immigrant-producing countries, individuals with less than a high school education continue to be a fiscal burden to the next generation. Skilled workers, however, pay more in taxes than what they receive in social spending from the state. The emigration of highly skilled workers has been linked to skill shortages, reductions in output, and tax shortfalls in many developing countries. These burdens are even more apparent in countries where educated workers largely emigrated after receiving a highly subsidised technical education. &quot;Brain Drain refers to the emigration (out-migration) of knowledgeable, well-educated and skilled professionals from their home country to another country, [usually because of] better job opportunities in the new country.&quot;

As of 2007, 10 million workers from Southeast Asia, South Asia, or Africa live and work in the countries of the Persian Gulf region. Xenophobia in receiving nations is often rampant, as menial work is often allocated only to foreign workers. In host countries, expatriate labour is treated with prejudice despite government attempts to eradicate malpractice and exploitation of workers. Emigrants are offered substandard wages and living conditions and must work overtime without extra payment. Workers or their dependents are not paid due to compensation regarding injuries and death. Citizenship is rarely offered, and labour can oftentimes be acquired below the legal minimum wage. Foreign workers often lack access to local labour markets. Oftentimes these workers are legally attached to a sponsor/employer until completion of their employment contract, after which a worker must either renew a permit or leave the country.

Racism is prevalent towards migrant workers. With an increasing number of unskilled workers from Asia and Africa, the market for foreign workers became increasingly racialised and dangerous, or &quot;dirty&quot; jobs became associated with Asian and African workers noted by the term &quot;Abed&quot;, meaning dark skin.

Foreign workers migrate to the West Asia as contract workers by means of the &quot;kafala&quot;, or &quot;sponsorship&quot; system. Migrant work is typically for two years. Recruitment agencies in sending countries are the main contributors of labour to GCC countries. Through these agencies, sponsors must pay a fee to the recruiter and pay for the worker&#x27;s round-trip airfare, visas, permits, and wages. Recruiters charge high fees to prospective employees to obtain employment visas, averaging between $2,000 and $2,500 in such countries as Bangladesh and India. Contract disputes are also common. In Saudi Arabia, foreign workers must have employment contracts written in Arabic and have them signed by the sponsor and themselves to be issued a work permit. Contracts may be written or oral with other GCC countries, such as Kuwait.

Dependence on the sponsor (&quot;kafeel&quot;) naturally creates room for violations of the rights of foreign workers. Debt causes workers to work for a certain period of time without a salary to cover these fees. This bondage encourages the practice of international labour migration as women in situations of poverty can find jobs overseas and pay off their debts through work. It is common for the employer or the sponsor to retain the employee&#x27;s passport and other identity papers as a form of insurance for the amount an employer has paid for the worker&#x27;s work permit and airfare. Kafeels sell visas to foreign workers with the unwritten understanding that the foreigner can work for an employer other than the sponsor.

When a two-year work period is over, or with a job loss, workers must find another employer willing to sponsor them or return to their nation of origin within a short time. Failing to do this entails imprisonment for violation of immigration laws. Protections are nearly non-existent for migrant workers.

The population in the current GCC states has grown more than eight times during 50 years. Foreign workers have become the primary, dominant labour force in most sectors of the economy and the government bureaucracy. With rising unemployment, GCC governments embarked on formulating labour market strategies to improve this situation, create sufficient employment opportunities for nationals, and limit the dependence on expatriate labour. Restrictions have been imposed: the sponsorship system, the rotational system of expatriate labour to limit the duration of foreigners&#x27; stay, curbs on naturalization and the rights of those who have been naturalised, etc. This has also led to efforts to improve the education and training of nationals. Localization remains low among the private sector, however. This is due to the traditionally low income the sector offers. Also included are long working hours, a competitive work environment, and a need to recognise an expatriate supervisor, often difficult to accept.

In 2005, low-paid Asian workers staged protests, some violent, in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar for not receiving salaries on time. In March 2006, hundreds of mostly south Asian construction workers stopped work and went on a rampage in Dubai, UAE, to protest their harsh working conditions, low or delayed pay, and general lack of rights. Sexual harassment of Filipina housemaids by local employers, especially in Saudi Arabia, has become serious. In recent years, this has resulted in a ban on the migration of females under 21. Such nations as Indonesia have noted the maltreatment of women in the GCC states, with the government calling for an end to the sending of housemaids altogether. In GCC countries, a chief concern with foreign domestic workers in childcare without the desired emphasis on Islamic and Arabic values.

Possible developments in the future include a slowdown in the growth of foreign labour. One contributor to this is a dramatic change in demographic trends. The growing birth rate of nationals in the GCC states will lead to a more competitive workforce in the future. This could also lead to a rise in the numbers of national women in the workforce.

A report published by human rights organizations in 2022 suggested up to 10,000 migrant workers die annually in the West Asia.

=== European Union ===
In 2016, around 7.14% (15.885.300 people) of total EU employment were not citizens, 3.61% (8.143.800) were from another EU Member State, 3.53% (7.741.500) were from a non-EU country. Switzerland 0.53%, France 0.65%, Spain 0.88%, Italy 1.08%, United Kingdom 1.46%, Germany 1.81% (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) were countries where more than 0.5% of employees were not citizens. 
The United Kingdom 0.91%, Germany 0.94% (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) are countries where more than 0.9% of employees were non-EU countries. 
countries with more than 0.5% employees were from another EU country were Spain 0.54%, United Kingdom 0.55%, Italy 0.72%, Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) 0.87%.

<doc id="384143" wikidata="Q7548386" url="?curid=384143" title="Snow cream">
<text>Snow cream can be one of two distinct desserts.
* A dessert consisting of whipped cream with added flavorings.
* A dessert in which snow is mixed with a sweetened dairy-based liquid to make an ice cream substitute. This is also known as snow ice cream.

== The cream-based dessert ==
Whipped cream, with or without flavorings, was known as &quot;snow cream&quot; or &quot;milk snow&quot; (&quot;neve di latte, neige de lait&quot;) until the 17th century. Whipped egg whites were also sometimes included. There are English and continental European recipes dating to the 16th century.

== The snow-based dessert ==

The technique of using snow as a main ingredient in a dessert is very old. Common ingredients for this variety are a dairy based ingredient, sugar and a flavouring agent. In adding a small amount of dairy-based liquid and a flavouring agent (similar to ice cream ingredients) into clean snow, the snow melts and congeals into a simple ice cream substitute.

== Other &quot;snow&quot; recipes ==
There are a variety of recipes bearing the name of snow but which are custards with various flavorings and toppings rather than participate deserts.

Apple snow, with puréed apple added to the basic recipe, was popular served hot in the 17th century while a more modern version is eaten cold. Fruit juice contents were also used in lemon and orange snow. There is a Russian version that is called air pie, which is egg white, sugar, and fruit pureé, whipped and served hot.

Summer snow is known as a version with fruit content, egg whites and alcohol.

Snowballs can be a variety of desserts. They are usually not related to snow cream desserts. One of these, which is more commonly known as slush, and is based on ice and fruit syrup, can be seen as related to snow cream.

A snow cone or sno cone is a frozen dessert made of crushed or shaved ice, flavored with brightly colored syrup, usually fruit-flavored, served in a paper cone or cup.

<doc id="384144" wikidata="Q1769698" url="?curid=384144" title="Elections in Norway">
<text>Norway elects its legislature on a national level. The parliament, the Storting (or &quot;Stortinget&quot; by Norwegian grammar), has 169 members elected for a four-year term (during which it may not be dissolved) by a form of proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies.

Norway has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments or minority cabinets.

In Norway, elections are held every second year, alternating between elections for the Parliament and local elections, both of which are held every four years.

Suffrage is universal from the year a person turns 18 years old, even if the person turns 18 later in the year the election is held. Only Norwegian citizens can vote in the Parliamentary elections, but foreigners who have lived in Norway for three years continuously can vote in the local elections. Women&#x27;s suffrage was adopted in 1913.

The last elections were the 2023 local elections on 11 September. The last parliamentary election was the 2021 parliamentary election, on 13 September.

==Election system==
Norway uses the same system in both local and national elections when it comes to distributing mandates. This method is the modified Sainte-Laguë method and the underlying principle is that the number of seats a party gets in the Storting should be as close as possible to the relative number of votes the party got in the election.

There are some exceptions to the above-mentioned principle:

# Leveling seats: These seats exist to resolve situations in which a party receives significant support, but not enough in any single constituency to ordinarily win a seat. A party must earn more than 4% of the total votes – the election threshold – to be entitled to levelling seats.
# Rural overrepresentation: Rural, sparsely-populated constituencies get more seats than the population would otherwise dictate. This is to maintain a representative feeling in assemblies and to prevent the preferences of urban areas always overruling those of rural areas. However, this has been criticised by the OSCE, among others, as being unfair.
# Many parties, but few seats: All of the nine parties represented in the Storting (Red Party (R), Socialist Left Party (SV), Green Party (Norway) (MDG), Labour Party (Ap), Centre Party (Sp), Venstre (V), Christian People&#x27;s Party (KrF), Conservative Party (H), Progress Party (FrP)) run lists of candidates in all 19 counties. There are also many minor parties that run in some, but not all, constituencies. These parties all compete for the same seats, and in constituencies with few seats, only a few parties win representation. This is partially offset by levelling seats, but only for parties above the election threshold.

Unlike most parliaments, the Storting always serves its full four-year term; the constitution does not allow snap elections, nor does it give the monarch the right to dissolve parliament even if the government wants to do so. By-elections are not used, as the list-system means that vacant seats are merely filled by the next one on the party list (suppleants). This is also the case when candidates take temporary leave due to illness, childbirth etc.

Norway switched its parliamentary elections from single-member districts decided by two-round run-offs to multi-member districts with proportional representation in 1919.

==Voting==
High voter turnout is generally seen as beneficial by all parties, and the voting process has been streamlined in order to encourage voting. Registration is automatic and based on the national registry,

===Ballots===
The ballots are uniform throughout the country, with the exception of the candidate list. Each ballot will contain the name of a party, and also a list of the candidates promoted by that party in order of priority.
Voters may assign personal choices among those candidates by checking a box next to the candidates name (thus changing the priority). Voters may also write in names from other lists if they so desire.

The ballot is in the form of an A4 sheet of paper folded in two (e.g. an A5 folder). The ballots are identical for all parties/lists in a given election. The inside of the ballot has the name of the party/list and the list of candidates. The outside of the ballot has a field for the election official to stamp the ballot as correctly received immediately prior to the voter casting the ballot in the ballotbox.

The ballots are located inside each voting booth. Election officials are tasked with keeping the number of ballots in each voting booth approximately even, to reduce the possibility of influencing the voter.

In the case of national elections, there is only one group of ballots to choose from. In the case of local elections, there is two groups of ballots, one for the County-level elections, and one for the municipality-level elections.

===Procedure===
# The voter first selects the ballot corresponding to the party/list he/she wants to cast a ballot in favor of.
# The voter then proceeds to change/amend the lists if desired.
# The voter then folds the ballot along a marked line, to ensure that no one can see which ballot he/she has chosen.
# The voter proceeds to an election official, identifies himself, is checked towards the voting registry, and gets the ballots stamped.
# The voter then casts the ballot in the ballot-box, one per election.

===Early voting===
Early voting can happen in any early polling place in the country, usually starting in July and ending about a week before election day. Voters wishing to vote early can search for polling places on the public website www.valglokaler.no.
Early polling places are usually at City Halls or similar public buildings. Larger cities such as Oslo also deploy mobile early polling places in places such as large public transport hubs, metro stations etc.
Voters are required to identify themselves before voting.

Voters submitting an early vote in another district/municipality than their own, will be given a ballot without a candidate list. The ballot will then be enclosed in an envelope with the name of his/her home district. The voter will then proceed to deliver the ballot to the sealed ballot box. The ballot will be mailed by to the correct district/municipality in advance of election day.

Voters may not change their ballot after submitting an early ballot.

===Voting from abroad===
Voters staying abroad can vote at Norwegian embassies and consulates. 

Voters abroad who are not close to any Norwegian foreign station can vote through mail. They can request ballots to be sent to them. Voters can also write their own ballots, as long as they follow a few simple rules. 

===Election day===
Election day is normally the 2nd Monday of September, but many polling places are also open the preceding Sunday. Election day is not a public holiday. Voters may only vote in their own municipality on election day. Polling places are usually local schools, community centers or similar, and are normally open from 09:00 or 12:00. All polling places close at 20:00 across the country.

==Parliamentary elections==

===Constituencies and seat distribution===

Norway was up until 2018, divided into 19 counties, and each of the former counties is a constituency in the election. Each constituency elects a pre-calculated number of seats in the Parliament, the Storting, based on the population and geographical area of the constituency. Each inhabitant scores one point and each square kilometer scores 1.8 points. This calculation is done every eight years. This practice has been criticized because in some larger counties with sparse population a single vote counts more than in other more densely populated counties. Others claim that counties with a scattered and sparse population situated far away from the central administration should have a stronger representation in the Parliament. In recent elections a vote in the northernmost county Finnmark has counted approximately twice a vote in the capital Oslo or the surrounding county Akershus.

Norwegian citizens living in Svalbard and Jan Mayen, as well as Norwegian citizens living abroad who have resided in Norway within the past ten years, are registered to vote in the constituency they last resided in.

After the votes are counted and the members of the Parliament are designated their respective seats of their county, 19 &quot;leveling seats&quot;, one in each county, are divided to parties who got fewer seats than their election result percentage would suggest. This practice was adopted in 1989. However, only parties with more than 4% of the votes on a national basis – the election threshold – are entitled to leveling seats.

For the 2021 election the distribution of seats, including &quot;levelling seats&quot;, is as follows:
==Local elections==
The local elections are two separate elections held at the same time. The first is the county election, which elects politicians to the county council. Second is the municipality election, which elects politicians to the municipal councils.

==Sámi Parliament election==

People of Sámi heritage, included in the Sámi Parliament&#x27;s electoral roll, are eligible to vote to the Sami Parliament of Norway. For the election Norway is divided into 13 constituencies from which 3 representatives are elected. In addition an additional representative is elected from the four constituencies with most votes. The election is held at the same time as the elections to the Norwegian Parliament.

<text>Misty, known as in Japan, is a fictional character in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise owned by Nintendo and created by Satoshi Tajiri. She has appeared as a Gym Leader in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, and their respective remakes. She was a protagonist in the ongoing anime for the first five seasons, travelling alongside Ash Ketchum and Brock / Tracey to become the world&#x27;s best Water-type Pokémon trainer before departing home to Cerulean City to run the family gym, but made recurring appearances after and eventually resuming her journey after Ash won the rank of World Champion. The character has also appeared in manga like &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot;. She specialises in Water Type Pokémon. Her Japanese voice actress is Mayumi Iizuka, while her English voice was supplied by Rachael Lillis and Michele Knotz.

==Conception and design==
Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series began in Japan in 1996 with the release of &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; for the Game Boy. In these games, the player assumes the role of a Pokémon Trainer whose goal is to capture and train creatures called Pokémon. Players use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon, and some can transform into stronger species, or evolve. The ultimate goal is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain creatures from all Pokémon species.

Designed by Ken Sugimori as a &quot;gym leader&quot;, a Pokémon trainer that acts as an area boss, Misty was introduced in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. Due to the nature of the game&#x27;s development, only one set of concept sketches were done before implementing the character as sprite art within the game. Originally intended to be the game&#x27;s third gym leader battle, she was changed to be the second instead for the game&#x27;s final release. Designed as a young woman with red hair tied into a side ponytail, Sugimori often depicted her in a two piece swimsuit to fit thematically with her gym and its swimming pools.

For her anime appearance, she was designed by Atsuko Nishida. Her outfit was changed significantly for this appearance, giving her sneakers, a yellow shirt that reached above her midriff, and blue shorts held up by red suspenders around her torso. Emphasis was placed on the shape of her eyes in the animation guides, and how to draw them. Her Japanese voice actress, Mayumi Iizuka, stated that during her audition the director asked her to act like herself, and in doing so she landed the role. As a result, she considers Misty to be the one character she has voiced who most represents herself. Iizuka keeps track of her character&#x27;s promotional appearances in merchandise and other material, additionally providing fans with insights on possible future cameos in the anime series.

In January 1999, Game Freak explained the origin of the English name of Misty: &quot;The English word for &#x27;Kasumi&#x27; is &#x27;Mist,&#x27; so the name was changed to &quot;-ty&quot; to make it sound more feminine.&quot;

==Appearances==
===In the video games===
In the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;FireRed&quot; &amp; &quot;LeafGreen&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, &quot;Crystal&quot;, &quot;Pokémon HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot;, Misty is the Gym Leader of Cerulean City. She specializes in Water-type Pokémon. Misty, in her anime form, also appears as a trophy in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; and as a gym leader in &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot;. Additionally, she appears on &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot; on a full Japanese Pichu Bros. Disc. The disc differs from the other Japanese disc, as Misty&#x27;s (Kasumi) voice actor is the narrator. Misty, as well as most of the gym leaders in Pokémon history, reappear in &quot;&quot;Pokémon Black 2&quot; and &quot;White 2&quot;&quot; as part of the Pokémon World Tournament.

===In the anime===
The anime follows the quest of one of the main characters, Ash Ketchum, as he and his friends travel around the fictitious world of Pokémon along with their Pokémon partners. Misty is a stubborn tomboy who trains Water Pokémon and has three siblings, Daisy, Lily, and Violet. She left the Gym to her three older sisters prior to traveling with Ash in the anime, although she still retained the title of Gym Leader despite this. She first comes across Ash when she accidentally fishes him and his Pikachu out of a river while fishing for water Pokémon. Soon after this incident, Ash &quot;borrows&quot; her bike in an attempt to flee from a flock of wild Spearow. The bike is later charred by an attack from Pikachu. Misty tells Ash she will not leave him alone until he replaces the bike and commits to follow him on his journey, and the two soon become best friends. After retrieving her repaired bike at the end of the Johto League Silver Conference, she returns to the Cerulean Gym and resumes her duties as the Gym Leader.

Misty becomes a central character in &quot;Pokémon Chronicles&quot;, a spin-off to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, and appears in several specials and episodes. She maintains her friendship with Ash and eventually goes to Hoenn to meet up with him, meeting May and Max, and sees him again when he returns to Pallet following a long stint in Hoenn. She also appeared in an arc composed of at least two episodes of the &quot;Sun &amp; Moon&quot; series, where she and Brock meet Ash and his friends in Kanto, and later appears in two more episodes of the &quot;Sun &amp; Moon&quot; series when she reunites with Ash in Alola. Misty made more appearances in &quot;Pokémon Ultimate Journeys: The Series&quot; as Ash&#x27;s journey with the show came to end.
In the early episodes, Misty is depicted as having a short temper, stubborn temperament, and little patience. As the series progresses, however, she mellows out and gradually shows herself to be kind and sensible. Misty becomes the parental guardian of Togepi, caring for it throughout the series. Misty constantly reins in Brock when he becomes enamored with pretty girls, often pulling him away by the ear. She also has the insectophobia of most Bug-type Pokémon. Misty aims to be a world-class Water-type Pokémon trainer despite her sisters&#x27; ridicule.

===In the manga===
The Misty character that appears in the &quot;Electric Tale of Pikachu&quot; manga series, which is loosely based on the anime, is similar to the Misty in the anime, while the Misty in &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot; is similar to the Misty in the video games. She appears throughout &quot;Electric Tale of Pikachu&quot;, traveling on occasion with Ash. In &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot;, When Red, the protagonist of the manga, first meets her, she is trying to recapture her Gyarados with help of her Staryu, which has been brainwashed by Team Rocket. They decide to team up and confront Team Rocket. The next morning, after spending the night resting in Misty&#x27;s mansion, Misty leads Red to her Gym and reveals herself to be the Gym Leader. They have a battle, and though Misty quickly gained the upper hand and easily defeated Red with her fast and strong Starmie, she is worried that if they do not prepare themselves, Team Rocket will defeat them easily. Red decides that he might actually need training, and agrees to train. At that point, they become close friends.

In &quot;Pokémon Pocket Monsters&quot;, Red, the protagonist of the series, is seeking a Moon Stone along with his Pikachu and his Clefairy (one that speaks human language). When they meet Misty, Clefairy notices that she is wearing a Moon Stone as a necklace. Misty declares that they battle her if they wish to have it. While the Clefairy is initially pumped up to battle, he quickly changes his mind when he sees that his opponent is a massive Blastoise. After a while, the battle is won when Clefairy sucks up all the water in a nearby river and releases the water onto Misty&#x27;s Pokémon, sending it flying into the sky. Just when Misty is about to reward Red&#x27;s group with the prize they sought, the stone is stolen.

==Critical reception==
The book &quot;The Japanification of Children&#x27;s Popular Culture&quot; described Misty&#x27;s portrayal in the anime as a mother figure, calling her a &quot;nurturing component&quot; for the original trio of herself, Ash and Brock. It further described her as an &quot;unusually &#x27;complete&#x27; girl of the cartoon world&quot;, noting both her feminine sentimentality and her &quot;explosive rage&quot;. &quot;Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces&quot; praised the character as being &quot;particularly nuanced&quot; and described her as contributing heavily to the series&#x27; appeal. &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon&quot; stated that though the anime focused on Ash, Misty was a distinctly significant character especially to young female consumers, neither &quot;butch&quot; nor &quot;dizzily feminine&quot;, seemingly &quot;carefully constructed to appeal to preadolescent girls&quot;. It added that, unlike other aggressive female characters in the series, Misty did not sacrifice her femininity to succeed, making the character further popular with young American women, a contrast to Japanese children who focused more on the individual Pokémon species to identify with.

In studies on the reactions boys and girls had to the concept of Misty as a heroine in the series, girls accepted it and were eager to associate themselves with the character, while boys attempted to belittle her efforts. On the other hand, children of both genders felt the character alongside Brock gave Ash a sense of identity and moral support, which researchers attributed to the concept of group identity. In another study, children were shown to associate the attributes of attractiveness and aggressiveness, while college students described the character as romantic. &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Global Adventure&quot; additionally stated Misty also served as a source of non-threatening sexuality for both older and younger male viewers, though the context of such was presented in a more subtle way for North American localizations of the series.

In 2013, nearing Halloween, Archie Comics illustrator Ryan Jampole utilized Misty as one of the 31 costumes for the character Roll from the Archie Comics adaptation of the &quot;Mega Man&quot; franchise.

<doc id="384152" wikidata="Q49463" url="?curid=384152" title="Marina Raskova">
<text>Marina Mikhaylovna Raskova (; née Malinina; 28 March 1912 – 4 January 1943) was the first woman in the Soviet Union to achieve the diploma of professional air navigator. Raskova went from a young woman with aspirations of becoming an opera singer to a military instructor to the Soviet&#x27;s first female navigator. She was the navigator to many record-setting as well as record-breaking flights and the founding and commanding officer of the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment, which was renamed the 125th M.M. Raskova Borisov Guards Dive Bomber Regiment in her honor. Raskova became one of over 800,000 women in the military service, founding three female air regiments, one of which eventually flew over 30,000 sorties in World War II and produced at least 30 Heroes of the Soviet Union.

== Early life ==

Marina Malinina was born to middle-class parents. Her father was operatic singer and singing instructor Mikhail Malinin () and her mother a teacher. Anna Lyubatovich, her mother&#x27;s sister, was a known Russian singer as Tatyana Lyubatovich (). Her half-brother (through her father) was shipbuilding scientist Boris Malinin. Unlike the majority of Soviet airwomen, Marina did not show any early interest in aviation. Becoming a pilot-navigator was her second choice. Raskova had originally wanted to become a musician, and her goal was to become an opera singer.

In 1919, when she was seven, her father died from the injuries inflicted when he was struck by a motorcycle. She continued her drama and singing studies, but later she fell victim to a middle ear infection that left her unable to continue singing. She decided to quit music and to devote herself to studying chemistry and engineering in high school. After graduation in 1929, to help her family, she started work in a dye factory as a chemist. She married an engineer, Sergey Raskov, whom she met at the dye factory, so changing her name to Raskova. She had a child, Tanya, in 1930. The following year she started to work in the Aero Navigation Laboratory of the Air Force Academy as a draftswoman.

Raskova became a famous aviator as both a pilot and a navigator for the Soviet Union in the 1930s. She was the first woman to become a navigator in the Soviet Air Force in 1933. A year later, she started teaching at the Zhukovsky Air Academy, also a first for a woman. She taught male and later, female students military navigation. She was the subject of skepticism by many of her male students but was able to prove herself capable. Later, the Academy sent Raskova to Tushino for the Central Flying Club in order to receive flying lessons, which she completed in August 1935. When Raskova&#x27;s training ended, she was able to become an instrument flying instructor and was allowed to teach command personnel advanced navigation. In 1935, she divorced. She set a number of long-distance records, a significant achievement in the eyes of the Soviet Union, which gave its aviators celebrity status. Most of these record flights occurred in 1937 and 1938, while she was still teaching at the air academy. She was referred to as the &quot;Russian Amelia Earhart&quot; for her achievements. 

The most famous of her long-distance records was the flight of the &quot;Rodina&quot; (Russian for &quot;Motherland&quot;), Ant-37 – a converted DB-2 long range bomber – on 24–25 September 1938. She was the navigator of the crew that also included Polina Osipenko and Valentina Grizodubova. From the start, the goal was to set an international women&#x27;s record for a straight-line distance flight. The plan was to fly from Moscow to Komsomolsk (in the Far East). When finally completed, the flight took 26 hours and 29 minutes, over a straight-line distance of (total distance of ). However, the ordeal took 10 days when the plane was unable to find an airfield due to poor visibility. Because the navigator&#x27;s cockpit had no entrance to the rest of the plane and was vulnerable in a crash landing, Raskova parachuted out before they touched down. She had forgotten her emergency kit and was unable to find the plane for 10 days, with no water and almost no food. The rescue crew had found the aircraft eight days after the landing, and was waiting when she found her way to it, after which all three women were taken to safety. On 2 November 1938, all three women were decorated with the Hero of the Soviet Union award, the first females ever to receive it and the only ones before World War II.

== World War II ==

When World War II broke out, there were numerous women who had training as pilots and many immediately volunteered. While there were no formal restrictions on women serving in combat roles, their applications tended to be blocked, run into red tape, etc. for as long as possible in order to discourage the applicants from entering any training program. Raskova is credited with having used her personal connections with Joseph Stalin to convince the military to form three combat regiments of women. Following a speech by Raskova on 8 September 1941 calling for women pilots to be allowed to fight, Stalin on 8 October 1941 ordered the formation of the all-female 122nd Aviation Corps. Not only would the women be pilots, but also support staff and engineers. After their training, the Group&#x27;s three regiments received their formal designations as follows:

*The 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment (586 IAP/PVO): This unit was the first to take part in combat (16 April 1942) of the three female regiments. Equipped with Yakovlev Yak-1, Yak-7B and Yak-9, it flew 4,419 flights. destroying 38 enemy aircraft in 125 air battles. Commanders were Tamara Kazarinova and later Aleksandr Gridnev.
* The 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment, (later renamed the 125th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment): Raskova commanded this unit until her death in a flying accident, while leading two other Petlyakovs to their first operative airfield, near Stalingrad, whereupon the unit was given to Valentin Markov. It started service as the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment until it was given the Guards designation in September 1943. The unit was given the very best of the Soviet bombers, the Petlyakov Pe-2, while many male units used obsolete aircraft, which resulted in much resentment. The unit flew 1,134 missions, dropping over 980 tons of bombs. It produced five Heroes of the Soviet Union.
* The 588th Night Bomber Aviation Regiment (later renamed the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, nicknamed the &quot;Night Witches&quot; (&quot;die Nachthexen&quot;) by the Germans): This was the best known of the regiments and was commanded by Yevdokia Bershanskaya. It originally began service as the 588th Night Bomber Regiment (588 NBAP), but was redesignated in February 1943 as recognition for service which tallied 24,000+ combat missions by the end of the war. The regiment produced 24 Heroes of the Soviet Union. Their aircraft was the Polikarpov Po-2, a very outdated biplane. They were the only one of the three regiments to remain solely female throughout the war, a distinction they went to some lengths to maintain.

Raskova died on 4 January 1943, when her aircraft crashed attempting to make a forced landing on the Volga bank, while leading two other Pe-2s to the first operative airfield near Stalingrad. The entire crew perished. She received the first state funeral of the war.

==Legacy==

Her ashes were buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on Red Square, beside Polina Osipenko&#x27;s. She was posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War I Class. An American ship, &quot;Ironclad&quot; (launched as &quot;Mystic&quot; in April 1919), that had taken part in Convoy PQ 17 was transferred to Soviet ownership and renamed in June 1943.

Streets were named after her in Moscow and Kazan, as well as a square in Moscow, some schools and Young Pioneer detachments. There was a bust of her at the &quot;M. M. Raskova&quot; Higher Military Aviation School of Pilots in Tambov, but that school ceased to function in 1997.
