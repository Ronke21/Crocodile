<text>The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) was a college football post-season selection system that created four or five bowl game match-ups involving eight or ten of the top ranked teams in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of American college football, including an opportunity for the top two teams to compete in a national championship game. The system was in place from the 1998 season to the 2013 season and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).

The BCS relied on a combination of polls and computer selection methods to determine relative team rankings, and to narrow the field to two teams to play in the BCS National Championship Game, held after the other college bowl games (the game rotated among four existing bowl games from the 1998 to 2005 season, and was a separate game from the 2006 to 2013 seasons). The American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) was contractually bound to vote the winner of this game as the BCS National Champion and the contract signed by each conference required them to recognize the winner of the BCS National Championship game as the official and only champion. The BCS was created to end split championships and for the champion to win the title on the field between the two teams selected by the BCS.

The system also selected match-ups for four other prestigious BCS bowl games: the Rose Bowl Game, Fiesta Bowl, Sugar Bowl and Orange Bowl. The ten teams selected included the conference champion from each of the six Automatic Qualifying (AQ) conferences plus four others (two others prior to the 2006 season). The BCS was created by formal agreement by those six conferences (the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC); Big East, now the American Athletic Conference (The American); Big Ten Conference (Big Ten); Big 12 Conference (Big 12); Pac-10, now the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12); Southeastern Conference (SEC) conferences); and the three FBS independent schools, and evolved to allow other conferences to participate to a lesser degree. For the 1998 through 2005 seasons, eight teams competed in four BCS bowls.

It had been in place since the 1998 season. The BCS replaced the Bowl Alliance, in place from 1995 to 1997, which had followed the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. Prior to the Bowl Coalition&#x27;s creation in 1992, the AP Poll&#x27;s number one and two teams had met in a bowl game only 8 times in 56 seasons. The AP&#x27;s top two teams met 13 out of the 16 seasons when the BCS was in place.

In the 2014 season, the BCS was discontinued and replaced by the College Football Playoff, which organizes a four-team playoff and national championship game. Ten years later, the playoff expanded to 12 teams.

==History leading to the creation and dissolution of the BCS==
The NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) is the only NCAA-sponsored sport without an officially organized NCAA tournament to determine its champion. Instead, the postseason has historically consisted of individual bowl games.

The bowl system began in 1902 with the first ever East–West game in Pasadena, California, held at Tournament Park on New Year&#x27;s Day in conjunction with the Tournament of Roses parade. This game was an exhibition game pitting a highly rated team from the west coast against a team from east of the Mississippi River. This was an ideal time for a postseason game, as fans could take off work or school during this holiday period to travel to the game. In the first game, the University of Michigan Wolverines represented the east and easily defeated the west&#x27;s representative Stanford by a score of 49–0. Due to the lopsided victory the game did not resume until 1916.

The game was renamed the Rose Bowl in the 1920s when play shifted to the Rose Bowl stadium, built by the city of Pasadena in conjunction with the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association. By the 1930s, the Cotton Bowl Classic in Dallas, Texas, Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida, and the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana were also held on January 1 to showcase teams from other regions of the country.

By the 1940s, college football conferences began signing contracts that tied their championship team to a particular bowl. In 1947, the Big Ten Conference and the Pacific Coast Conference, a forerunner of today&#x27;s Pac-12 Conference, agreed to commit their champions to play in the Rose Bowl every year, an agreement that continued under the BCS. This system raised the possibility that the two top-ranked teams in the final poll would not play each other in a bowl game, even in situations when there was a clear-cut top two. Indeed, since the AP began releasing its final poll after the bowl games in 1968, the two top-ranked teams in the final regular-season AP Poll had only played each other in a bowl six times until special bowl arrangements began in 1992. Under these circumstances, it was not uncommon to have the Coaches Poll crown a different national champion than the AP Poll, resulting in a split championship. This situation arose a total of ten different seasons before BCS was formed (1954, 1957, 1965, 1970, 1973, 1974, 1978, 1990, 1991, 1997).

For example, in 1991, the University of Miami Hurricanes and the University of Washington Huskies both finished the regular season undefeated and were considered the strongest teams in the nation. Since the Huskies were locked into the Rose Bowl as the Pac-10 Conference champion against Big Ten champion Michigan, they could not play Big East member Miami, who played in the Orange Bowl. Both teams won their bowl games convincingly and shared the national championship, Miami winning the Associated Press poll and Washington earning the top spot in the Coaches Poll. A split national championship has happened on several occasions since then as well (1997, 2003). (See: NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship for a compilation of past &quot;national champions&quot; since 1869.)

Other teams have won the national championship despite playing presumably weaker schedules than other championship contenders. The BYU Cougars ended the 1984 season as the only undefeated and untied team in the nation, and the nine-time defending champions of the Western Athletic Conference. The Cougars opened the season with a 20–14 victory over No. 3 Pittsburgh, and won the Holiday Bowl against a 6–5 Michigan team that had been ranked as high as No. 2 that season. As the No. 4 ranked team at the end of the regular season, Washington was offered a slot against BYU in the Holiday Bowl; Washington declined, preferring instead to play in the more lucrative Orange Bowl where they beat No. 2 Oklahoma to complete a Pac-10 sweep of New Year&#x27;s Day bowls (with USC winning the Rose Bowl and UCLA winning the Fiesta Bowl). Washington (11–1) was voted No. 2 following the bowl season with their only blemish a late season loss at Pac-10 champion USC. Coupled with winning its last 11 games in 1983, BYU finished the 1984 season with a 24-game winning streak. Several coaches and reporters claimed that BYU had not played a legitimate schedule and should not be recognized as national champion. Not only was Pittsburgh the only ranked team the Cougars faced all season, but at the time BYU played in the mid-major WAC. Nonetheless, BYU was a near-unanimous choice as national champion in final polls.

To address these problems, five conferences, six bowl games, and leading independent Notre Dame joined forces to create the Bowl Coalition, which was intended to force a &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;national championship game&quot; between the top two eligible teams in the rankings. By entirely excluding all the other conferences, the Bowl Coalition also made it impossible for a non-Bowl Coalition team to win a national championship. This system was in place from the 1992 season through the 1994 season. While traditional tie-ins between conferences and bowls remained, a team would be released to play in another bowl if it was necessary to force a championship game.

However, this system did not include the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions, as both were obligated to play in the Rose Bowl. The Coalition made several attempts to get the Tournament of Roses Association, which operates the Rose Bowl, to release the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions if necessary to force a championship game. However, those negotiations came to nothing, in part because the Tournament of Roses Association feared jeopardizing its long-standing contract with ABC if one or both teams were needed to force a title game. In 1994—the last year of the Bowl Coalition—undefeated Penn State, from the Big Ten, played Oregon in the Rose Bowl while undefeated Nebraska played Miami in the Orange Bowl. In a system that paired top-ranked teams, Penn State would have played Nebraska for the national championship.

The Bowl Coalition was restructured into the Bowl Alliance for the 1995 season, involving five conferences (reduced to four for the 1996 season) and three bowls (Fiesta, Sugar, and Orange). The championship game rotated among these three bowls. It still did not, however, include the Pac-10 or Big Ten champions, the Rose Bowl, or any non-Bowl Alliance teams.

After a protracted round of negotiations, the Bowl Alliance was reformed into the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; former Southeastern Conference commissioner Roy Kramer is considered to be the &quot;father&quot; of the BCS. The Tournament of Roses Association agreed to release the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions if it was necessary to force a national championship game. In return, the Rose Bowl was added to the yearly national championship rotation, and the game was able to keep its coveted exclusive TV time slot on the afternoon of New Year&#x27;s Day. However, beginning with the 2006 season, the BCS National Championship Game became a separate event played at the same site as a host bowl a week following New Year&#x27;s Day. 

The new Bowl Championship Series not only included the Big Ten and the Pac-10 conferences but also teams from mid-major conferences, based on performance. No mid-major team, however, or team from any conference outside of the six aligned conferences (with the exception of independent Notre Dame, who played Alabama for the 2012 title), ever played in the BCS Championship Game, causing increasing controversy. This controversy had become even more intense in light of the 4–1 record that mid-major teams had against teams from the six automatic qualifying conferences in the BCS Bowl games they &quot;had&quot; been allowed to play in. The performances and perfect record of Texas Christian in the 2010 season and Boise State in the season prior to that also fueled the controversy surrounding the perceived inequalities that the BCS seemed to perpetuate. However, little headway was made to institute an alternative system, given the entrenched vested economic interests in the various bowls, until after the 2011 season, which saw LSU and Alabama—both members of the SEC West division—play each other in the 2012 BCS Championship game, where Alabama defeated LSU in a shutout win. 

Thereafter, acknowledging the many game, polling, and other related controversies, fans&#x27; complaints, and declining game viewership, among other factors, the major conferences decided to institute the College Football Playoff, which began in the 2014 regular season. As a legal entity, the holding company &quot;BCS Properties, LLC&quot; continues to control the College Football Playoff.

==Succession by College Football Playoff==
The College Football Playoff replaced the BCS as the system used to determine the FBS college football champion beginning in the 2014 season. The four-team playoffs consist of two semifinal games, with the winners advancing to the College Football Championship Game. The game is hosted by a different city each year, with locations selected by bids, akin to the Super Bowl or the Final Four. AT&amp;T Stadium hosted the first title game in 2015. The system is contracted to be in place through at least the 2023–2024 season per a contract with ESPN, which owns the rights to broadcast all games. Unlike the BCS, the system does not use polls or computer rankings to select participants. A 13-member committee chooses and seeds the teams for the two playoff games and four other top-tier bowl games, using a balloting procedure similar to the NCAA basketball tournament selection process.

==Bowl games==
In the BCS format, four regular bowl games and the National Championship Game were considered &quot;BCS bowl games.&quot; The four bowl games were the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California, the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, and the Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Florida.

In the first eight seasons of the BCS contract, the championship game was rotated among the four bowls, with each bowl game hosting the national championship once every four years. Starting with the 2007 BCS, the National Championship Games became a separate game played on January 8 at the site of the BCS bowl game that served as the final game on January 1, or January 2 if January 1 was a Sunday.

The University of Oklahoma and Ohio State University are the only schools to appear in all five BCS Bowls. Oklahoma played in the 2007, 2008, and 2011 Fiesta Bowl, the 2004 (national championship) and 2014 Sugar Bowl, the 2001 and 2005 Orange Bowl (both of which were national championships), the 2003 Rose Bowl, and the 2009 BCS National Championship Game. Oklahoma&#x27;s record was 4–5 with a 1–3 record in National Title games. Ohio State played in the 2003 (national championship), 2004, 2006, and 2009 Fiesta Bowl, the 1999 and 2011 Sugar Bowl*, the 2014 Orange Bowl, the 2010 Rose Bowl, and the 2007 and 2008 BCS National Championship Game. Ohio State&#x27;s record was 6*-4, with a 1–2 record in National Title Games. The University of Miami appeared in every BCS bowl except for the standalone National Championship Game, although Miami did appear in the national championship when that designation was assigned to the original four bowls in rotation. Miami played in the 2001 Sugar Bowl, 2002 Rose Bowl (national championship), 2003 Fiesta Bowl (national championship), and 2004 Orange Bowl.

* Ohio State won the 2011 Sugar Bowl, but vacated their appearance and victory due to NCAA penalties and sanctions for impermissible acceptance of monetary gifts.

===Television===
Initially, ABC held the rights to all four original BCS games, picking up the Fiesta and Orange Bowls from their former homes at CBS, and continuing their lengthy relationships with the Rose and Sugar Bowls. This relationship continued through the bowl games of January 2006.

From the 2006–07 season through the 2009–10 season, Fox Sports held the rights to the BCS games with the exception of the Rose Bowl, as the Tournament of Roses Association elected to continue its association with ABC. Under the terms of the contract, Fox aired three of the four BCS National Championship Games that were played during the time. The only exception was the 2010 contest, which aired on ABC as per its contracts with the Rose Bowl and Tournament of Roses Association.

After the January 2010 bowl games, the contract to air the BCS moved exclusively to ESPN. The network carried the BCS until its dissolution following the 2013–14 season; after that, the four former BCS bowls became part of the College Football Playoff, while ESPN retained their coverage of the contests.

===Selection of teams===
A set of rules was used to determine which teams competed in the BCS bowl games.

Certain teams were given automatic berths depending on their BCS ranking and conference, as follows:
* No more than two teams from any one conference could receive berths in BCS games, unless two non-champions from an AQ conference finished as the top two teams in the final BCS standings, in which case they met in the National Title Game while their conference champion played in their conference&#x27;s BCS bowl game.
* The top two teams were given automatic berths in the BCS National Championship Game.
* The champion of an AQ Conference (ACC, Big 12, Big East/The American, Big Ten, Pac-10/Pac-12, and SEC) was guaranteed an automatic BCS bowl bid.
* Due to the &quot;Notre Dame rule&quot;, independent Notre Dame received an automatic berth if it finished in the top eight. Other independents were not covered under this rule.
* From the 1999 season onwards, the highest ranked non-champion in an AQ conference received an automatic berth, provided it was ranked in the top 4 and its conference did not already receive two automatic berths from the above rules. If the highest ranked non-champion was in the top 2 and thus played in the championship game, this provision extended to the highest ranked non-champion outside the top 2.
* From the 2006 season onwards, the highest-ranked champion of a non-AQ conference (Big West, C-USA, MAC, Mountain West, Sun Belt, and WAC) received an automatic berth if:
** It was ranked in the top 12, or
** It was ranked in the top 16 and higher than at least one AQ conference champion.

After the automatic berths were granted, the remaining berths, known as &quot;at-large&quot; berths, were filled from a pool of FBS teams who were ranked in the top 14 and had at least nine wins. The actual teams chosen for the at-large berths were determined by the individual bowl committees. Teams from both AQ and non-AQ conferences were eligible for at-large berths.

If there were not enough teams eligible for at-large selection to fill the BCS bowl games, then the remaining at-large teams would have been any FBS teams that were bowl-eligible, had won at least nine regular-season games, and were among the top 18 teams in the final BCS standings. If there were still not enough teams, the pool for potential at-larges continued to increase by four teams until enough teams were available.

All AQ conferences except the Big East/The American had contracts for their champions to participate in specific BCS bowl games. Unless their champion was involved in the BCS National Championship game, the conference tie-ins were:
* Rose Bowl – Big Ten champion and Pac-10/Pac-12 champion
* Fiesta Bowl – Big 12 champion
* Orange Bowl – ACC champion
* Sugar Bowl – SEC champion

The Big East/The American champion took one of the remaining spots.

Additionally, from 1998-99 to 2005-06, when the BCS National Championship Game was one of the bowls, the champions that would otherwise have automatically received a berth in that bowl, would still be guaranteed a berth but in a different bowl. E.g. the Rose Bowl for 2005-06 was the NCG with #1 USC vs #2 Texas. While USC was the Pac-10 champion and therefore no other bowl would be needed to accommodate, Texas took what would have been the Big Ten&#x27;s spot, therefore the Big Ten champion was selected by a different bowl, in this case the Orange Bowl.

If the Pac-10/Pac-12 or Big Ten champion was picked for the BCS National Championship Game, then the Rose Bowl was required to choose the highest-ranked school from a non-AQ conference if there was a non-AQ school ranked at least #4 in the final BCS standings. This was the case in 2010, when the #2 Oregon Ducks made it to the national championship, permitting the #3 TCU Horned Frogs to attend, and win, the 2011 Rose Bowl. The Rose Bowl was permitted to override this provision if it had been used within the previous four seasons. 

As agreed by all 11 conferences, the results of the 2004–07 regular seasons were evaluated to determine which conferences earned automatic qualification for the BCS games that concluded 2008–11 seasons. Three criteria were used: Rank of the highest-ranked team, rank of all conference teams, and number of teams in the top 25. The six conferences which met that standard were the AQ conferences. The 2008–11 seasons were used to determine if another conference achieved automatic qualification, or a conference that had AQ status lost it, for the BCS games that concluded the 2012 and 2013 seasons.

==Rankings==
For the portions of the ranking that were determined by polls and computer-generated rankings, the BCS used a series of Borda counts to arrive at its overall rankings. This was an example of using a voting system to generate a complete ordered list of winners from both human and computer-constructed votes. Obtaining a fair ranking system was a difficult mathematical problem and numerous algorithms were proposed for ranking college football teams in particular. One example was the &quot;random-walker rankings&quot; studied by applied mathematicians Thomas Callaghan, Peter Mucha, and Mason Porter that employed the science of networks.

===1998–2003===
The BCS formula calculated the top 25 teams in poll format. After combining a number of factors, a final point total was created and the teams that received the 25 lowest scores were ranked in descending order. The factors were:
* Poll average: Both the AP and ESPN-&quot;USA Today&quot; coaches polls were averaged to make a number which is the poll average.
* Computer average: An average of the rankings of a team in three different computer polls were gathered (Jeff Sagarin/&quot;USA Today&quot;, Anderson &amp; Hester/&quot;Seattle Times&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;), with a 50% adjusted maximum deviation factor. (For instance, if the computers had ranked a team third, fifth, and twelfth, the poll which ranked the team twelfth would be adjusted to rank the team sixth.)
* Strength of Schedule: This was the team&#x27;s NCAA rank in strength of schedule divided by 25. A team&#x27;s strength of schedule was calculated by win–loss record of opponents (66.6%) and cumulative win–loss record of team&#x27;s opponents&#x27; opponents (33.3%). The team who played the toughest schedule was given .04 points, second toughest .08 points, and so on.
Margin of victory was a key component in the decision of the computer rankings to determine the BCS standings.
* Losses: One point was added for every loss the team has suffered during the season. All games are counted, including Kickoff Classics and conference title games.

Before the 1999–2000 season, five more computer rankings were added to the system: Richard Billingsley, Richard Dunkel, Kenneth Massey, Herman Matthews/&quot;Scripps Howard&quot;, and David Rothman. The lowest ranking was dropped and the remainder averaged.

Beginning in 2001, The Peter Wolfe and Wes Colley/&quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; computer rankings were used in place of the &quot;NYT&quot; and Dunkel rankings. The change was made because the BCS wanted computer rankings that did not depend heavily on margin of victory. The highest and lowest rankings were discarded, and the remainder averaged. A team&#x27;s poll average, computer average, strength of schedule points, and losses were added to create a subtotal.

Also in 2001, a quality win component was added. If a team beat a team which was in the top 15 in the BCS standings, a range of 1.5 to .1 points was subtracted from their total. Beating the No. 1 ranked team resulted in a subtraction of 1.5-point, beating the No. 2 team resulted in a deduction of 1.4 points, and so on. Beating the No. 15 ranked team would have resulted in a deduction of .1 points. A team would only be awarded for a quality win once if it beat a Top 10 team more than once (such as in the regular season and a conference championship game), and quality wins were determined using a team&#x27;s current subtotal, not the ranking when the game was played. The subtotal ranks were used to determine quality win deductions to create a team&#x27;s final score.

The BCS continued to purge ranking systems which included margin of victory, causing the removal of the Matthews and Rothman ratings before the 2002 season. Sagarin provided a BCS-specific formula that did not include margin of victory, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; index returned in a form without margin of victory considerations. In addition, a new computer ranking, the Wesley Colley Matrix, was added. The lowest ranking was dropped and the remaining six averaged. Also in 2002, the quality win component was modified such that the deduction for beating the No. 1 team in the BCS would be 1.0, declining by 0.1 increments until beating the 10th ranked team at 0.1. Teams on probation were not included in the BCS standings, but quality win points were given to teams who beat teams on probation as if they were ranked accordingly in the BCS.

===2004–2013===

In response to the controversy created by the voters in the AP poll naming USC as the No. 1 ranked team at the end of 2003, when the BCS system had selected LSU and Oklahoma to play for the title, the formula was rewritten. Supporters of USC and the media in general criticized the fact that polls were not weighted more heavily than computer rankings and this criticism led to the new three part formula.
* AP Poll (2004) / Harris Interactive Poll (2005–2013): A team&#x27;s score in the poll was divided by the maximum number of points any team would have received if all voting members had ranked that team as Number 1.
* Coaches&#x27; Poll: A team&#x27;s score in the Coaches&#x27; poll was divided by the maximum number of points any team would have received if all voting members had ranked that team as Number 1.
* Computer Average: The BCS used six ranking systems: Jeff Sagarin, Anderson &amp; Hester, Billingsley Report, Colley Matrix, Kenneth Massey, and Dr. Peter Wolfe. Points were assigned in inverse order of ranking from 1 to 25. A team&#x27;s highest and lowest computer ranking was discarded from figuring a team&#x27;s computer poll average. The four remaining computer scores were averaged and the total was calculated as a percentage of 100.

All three components – The Harris Interactive Poll, the USA Today Coaches Poll, and the computer rankings – were added together and averaged for a team&#x27;s ranking in the BCS standings. The team with the highest average ranked first in the BCS standings.

This system placed twice as much emphasis on polls than computer rankings (since there were two polls and an average of six computer rankings) and made it highly unlikely that the top team in both polls would be denied a place in the title game, as it happened in the 2003–04 season.

The BCS formula for the 2005–06 season was the same as 2004–05, except that the Harris Interactive College Football Poll replaced the AP poll. The Harris Interactive College Football Poll&#x27;s maximum point value was 2,825 and for the Coaches&#x27; Poll, it was 1,550. The Harris Interactive College Football Poll was created expressly to replace the AP Poll after the Associated Press refused the use of its poll as a component of the BCS formula following the 2004 season. Before the 2006–07 season, the maximum point value of the Harris Poll was increased to 2,850 and the USA Today/Coaches&#x27; Poll was increased to 1,575.

In April 2009, Bowl Championship Series commissioners met for its annual spring meetings in Pasadena, California in conjunction with the Rose Bowl&#x27;s staging the 2010 BCS title game. The commissioners considered a proposal from the Mountain West Conference, which would have established an eight-team playoff and provided better accesses to the four BCS bowl games for the five conferences that did not have automatic bids. The proposal also included a motion to replace the BCS rankings with a selection and a motion to change the automatic qualifier criteria to better reflect inter-conference performance. The BCS rejected the proposal in June 2009, citing a &quot;lack of overall support&quot; among the member conferences.

In June 2012, the BCS conference commissioners made the announcement that &quot;we have developed a consensus behind a four-team, seeded playoff.&quot; This took effect in 2014, as the BCS Presidential Oversight Committee in Washington, D.C. gave its expected final approval a few days later.

‡ Though winning the BCS National Championship, the LSU Tigers were not consensus national champions. The USC Trojans ended the regular season ranked No. 3 in the final BCS standings, with three Coaches Poll voting coaches defecting from their agreement with the BCS to vote its designated game winner as champion, instead voting for USC. USC was voted No. 1 in the Associated Press poll, and the AP awarded USC their National Championship. The 2003 Season therefore ended with split champions which is what the BCS was organized to prevent. Because of this split championship, significant changes were made to the BCS formula for the 2004–05 season.

==Controversies==
===Criticism===
The primary criticism of the BCS centered around the validity of the annual BCS national championship pairings and its designated &quot;National Champions&quot;. Many critics focused on the BCS methodology itself, which employed subjective voting assessments, while others noted the ability for undefeated teams to finish seasons without an opportunity to play in the &quot;national championship&quot; game. In fact, in the last 6 seasons of Division I FBS football, there had been more undefeated non-BCS champions than undefeated BCS champions. Other criticisms involved discrepancies in the allocation of monetary resources from BCS games, as well as the determination of non-championship BCS game participants, which did not have to comply with the BCS rankings themselves. In the 2010–2011 bowl season, for example, the six automatic-qualifier (AQ) conferences were given $145.2 million in revenue from the BCS while the five non-AQ conferences received only $24.7 million.

A 2012 survey conducted at the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found that 63% of individuals interested in college football preferred a playoff system to the BCS, while only 26% favored the status quo. President Barack Obama had been vocal about his opposition to the BCS. During an appearance on Monday Night Football during the 2008 presidential campaign season, ESPN&#x27;s Chris Berman asked Obama to name one thing about sports he would like to change. Obama responded that he did not like using computer rankings to determine bowl games, and he supported having a college football playoffs for the top eight teams. When Steve Kroft asked then-President-elect Obama about the subject during an interview on 60 Minutes, Obama reiterated his support of eight-team playoffs; although he said it was not a legislative priority, he was considering an executive order to address the issue.

Longtime college football announcer Brent Musburger also voiced his support for playoffs in college football in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times. &quot;My dream scenario – and it&#x27;s not going to happen – would be to take eight conference champions, and only conference champions, and play the quarterfinals of a tournament on campuses in mid-December&quot;, Musburger said. &quot;The four losers would remain bowl-eligible. The four winners would advance to semifinals on New Year&#x27;s Day with exclusive TV windows. Then, like now, one week later, there would be the national championship game.&quot;

===Antitrust lawsuits===
In 2008, a lawsuit was threatened due to the exclusion of teams from the non-automatic qualifying conferences in the BCS system. Following Utah&#x27;s win over Alabama in the 2009 Sugar Bowl, Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff announced an inquiry into whether the BCS system violates federal antitrust laws. In 2009, senior Utah senator Orrin Hatch announced that he was exploring the possibility of a lawsuit against the BCS as an anti-competitive trust under the Sherman Antitrust Act. On November 27, 2009, the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; ran a story that said that Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX), ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, announced that he would hold antitrust hearings on the BCS, again based on the Sherman Antitrust Act and its provisions outlawing non-competitive trusts, beginning in May 2010. Meanwhile, various organizations, including the BCS, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby the federal government both in support and in opposition to a college football playoffs system.

According to CBSSports.com wire reports and information obtained by the Associated Press, Senator Orrin Hatch received a letter from the Justice Department concerning the possibility of a legal review of the BCS. The letter, received on January 29, 2010, stated that the Obama administration would explore options to establish a college football playoffs including (a) an antitrust lawsuit against the BCS, (b) legal action under Federal Trade Commission consumer protection laws, (c) encouragement of the NCAA to take control of the college football postseason, (d) the establishment of an agency to review the costs and benefits of adopting a playoff system, and (e) continued legislation in favor of a playoff system. Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich wrote, &quot;The administration shares your belief that the lack of a college football national championship playoff ...raises important questions affecting millions...&quot; BCS Executive Director Bill Hancock responded to the letter that the BCS complied with all laws and was supported by the participating Division I universities.

In April 2011, Utah attorney general Mark Shurtleff announced he would file an antitrust lawsuit against the BCS for, &quot;serious antitrust violations that are harming taxpayer-funded institutions to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.&quot; The announcement followed the April 12, 2011 delivery of a letter to the US Department of Justice signed by 21 &quot;high-profile&quot; economists and antitrust experts asking for an investigation into the BCS&#x27; anticompetitive practices.

===Allegations of corruption and financial impropriety===
The BCS bowls had been accused of promoting the BCS system because they and their executive officers greatly benefited financially from the system. Bowl executives, such as John Junker of the Fiesta Bowl, were often paid unusually high salaries for employees of non-profit organizations. To promote support for their bowls and the BCS system, these highly paid executives allegedly gave lavish gifts to politicians, collegiate sports executives, and university athletic directors.

In response, a pro-playoff organization, called Playoff PAC, in September 2010 filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service. The complaint alleged that the top BCS bowls, with the exception of the Rose Bowl, routinely abused favorable tax status by using charitable donations to give gifts and compensation to college athletic officials. In one example detailed in the complaint, the Orange Bowl treated its executive staff and invited college athletic directors to a four-day Royal Caribbean cruise in which no business meetings were held.

===Vacated wins===
There were several occasions where a team&#x27;s victory in a BCS bowl game was subsequently vacated by NCAA sanctions.
* USC&#x27;s final appeals were exhausted in the Reggie Bush situation, with all penalties standing, including a two-year bowl ban and vacation of 14 wins, including a national championship in the Orange Bowl and the entire 2005 season. As a result, the BCS, in a first-time action, vacated the &quot;participation&quot; of USC in their 2004–2005 National Championship Game win and the 2005–2006 National Championship Game loss to Texas. The 2004–2005 BCS National Championship will remain permanently vacant. This issue was further compounded by the Associated Press, whose writers vote on their own National Championship. That title was retained, with the AP staying consistent with similar policies with teams on postseason bans. (Teams being penalized with postseason bans are still eligible for the AP National Championship title.)
* In December 2010, five Ohio State University players were implicated in an illegal-benefits scandal preceding the 2011 Sugar Bowl. Though the five players were suspended for five games apiece, they were allowed to play in the Sugar Bowl. After defeating Arkansas, the scandal grew, including open deception by Ohio State coach Jim Tressel. As a result, the school fined Tressel $250,000 and then forced him out as coach on July 11, 2011, Ohio State vacated all of its wins in an effort to reduce their penalties. The NCAA gave Ohio State 3 years probation and reduced their football scholarships by 3 per year for three years. The BCS banned Ohio State from participating in any post season games for the 2012 season.

===Support===
While there was substantial criticism aimed at the BCS system from coaches, media, and fans alike, there was is also support for the system. Tim Cowlishaw of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; cited several advantages that the BCS has over a playoff system. Under the BCS, a single defeat was extremely detrimental to a team&#x27;s prospects for a national championship, although critics pointed out regularly that history shows non-AQ conference teams were hurt far more than AQ conference teams when they lost a game. Supporters contended that this created a substantial incentive for teams to do their best to win every game. Under a proposed playoffs system, front-running teams could be in a position of safety at the end of the regular season and could pull or greatly reduce their use of top players in order to protect them from injuries or give them recovery time (this happens frequently in the NFL). This may have been less likely to happen under the BCS system where a team in the running for a No. 1 or No. 2 ranking at the end of the year would likely have been punished in the polls for a loss, potentially eliminating them from contention.

While the BCS routinely involved controversy about which two teams are the top teams, in rare instances there was a clear-cut top two; the BCS ensured these top two would play each other for the championship. For example, USC and Texas in 2005 were the only undefeated teams; both teams were only tested a couple of times all season and mauled every other opponent they faced by large margins. Had this scenario occurred before the inception of the BCS, the teams would have been unable to play each other due to contractual obligations with the major bowls and there would have been dual national champions. Under the BCS system however, these two teams got to play for the championship.

The NCAA, the governing organization of most collegiate sports, had no official process for determining its FBS (Div. 1-A) champion. Instead, FBS champions were chosen by what the NCAA called in its official list of champions &quot;selecting organizations&quot;.

According to its website, the BCS:
&quot;...[wa]s managed by the commissioners of the 11 NCAA Division I-A conferences, the director of athletics at the University of Notre Dame, and representatives of the bowl organizations.
&quot;...[wa]s a five-game arrangement for post-season college football that [wa]s designed to match the two top-rated teams in a national championship game and to create exciting and competitive match-ups between eight other highly regarded teams in four other games&quot;.

==BCS Buster==

The term &quot;BCS Buster&quot; referred to any team not from an AQ conference (other than Notre Dame) that managed to earn a spot in a BCS bowl game. These teams were often referred to as non-AQ when discussed outside of the post-season structure. Three teams had been BCS Busters twice: the University of Utah, Boise State University, and Texas Christian University. As of the 2013 season, two of those teams had joined Conferences with an automatic bid to a BCS Bowl (Utah to the Pac-12 Conference and Texas Christian to the Big 12 Conference).

The record of non-Automatic Qualifying conference teams in BCS Bowls was one primary statistic used by those who challenged the assumption that BCS AQ conference teams were inherently superior to non-AQ teams, as non-AQ teams had only lost two BCS Bowl games to a BCS AQ team (Hawaii lost the 2008 Sugar Bowl 41–10 to the University of Georgia and Northern Illinois lost the 2013 Orange Bowl to Florida State University) while winning four. Boise State defeated TCU 17–10 in the highly controversial 2010 Fiesta Bowl which was the only BCS Bowl pitting two non-AQ teams against each other rather than against a team from a BCS AQ Conference, making the complete record 5–3. This pairing was cited by critics as the BCS&#x27; attempt to prevent a loss (or potentially even two losses) to AQ teams in the same year, and as TCU defeated Wisconsin 21–19 in the 2011 Rose Bowl the next year those fears seemed to have been at least partly justified. The experience and results of the non-AQ teams in BCS bowl games had been cited as a strong objective example of a much closer parity between the AQ and non-AQ teams than most AQ teams and fans would have admitted.

With the exception of Notre Dame, it was generally extremely difficult for a non-AQ conference team to reach a BCS bowl, while it was much easier for an AQ conference team (see rules above) to do so due to the inherent bias built into the rules of the BCS system which guaranteed a spot to the winner of each of the AQ Conferences. All AQ Conference teams had to do was simply win their respective conference title and they were automatically invited to a BCS Bowl. This made becoming a BCS Buster very noteworthy. Despite the fact that there had been a number of eligible non-AQ conference teams, only eight teams (from only five schools – Utah, TCU, Boise State, Hawaii, and Northern Illinois) had succeeded in becoming BCS Busters. No team from a non-AQ conference had ever been in the BCS Championship, while a team from the SEC had been in—and won—the Championship game every year from 2006 to 2012. This consistent selection of one conference&#x27;s teams (despite their success) had been one area of intense criticism of the BCS system and its exclusionary tendencies.

The University of Utah became the first BCS Buster in 2004 after an undefeated season, despite stricter limits in place before the addition of a 5th bowl in 2006 made BCS Busters more commonplace. The Utes played in the 2005 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, and beat their opponent, the Pittsburgh Panthers, 35–7. Utah also became the first non-AQ program to make a second BCS appearance. During the 2008 season, the Utes finished their regular season schedule undefeated (8–0 in the Mountain West Conference and 12–0 overall) and earned a berth in the Sugar Bowl against Alabama, winning 31–17. The Utes finished 2nd in the AP Poll and received 16 first place votes. In the 2011 season, the Utes began competing as members of the Pac-12 Conference, one of the six conferences with an automatic BCS tie in.

In 2006, Boise State became the second BCS Buster after a 12–0 regular season and subsequent Fiesta Bowl berth against the Oklahoma Sooners. The Broncos won 43–42 in overtime in what many fans, pundits, and others consider to be one of the best Bowl games in history.

In 2007, Hawaii also finished the regular season at 12–0, but were defeated by the Georgia Bulldogs 41–10 in the Sugar Bowl. This was the first loss by a BCS Buster.

The 2009 season was the first in which two teams from non–AQ conferences earned BCS bowl berths. TCU, which finished the regular season 12–0 as champions of the Mountain West, earned the automatic BCS berth with a No. 4 finish in the final BCS rankings. Two slots behind the Horned Frogs were WAC champions Boise State, which finished at 13–0 for its second consecutive unbeaten regular season and fourth in six years. Boise State became the first and (so far) only BCS Buster to reach a BCS bowl game with an at-large selection. The Broncos defeated the Frogs 17–10 in the 2010 Fiesta Bowl, which marked the first BCS matchup between non-AQ schools, and the first time in BCS history that two unbeaten teams met in a BCS game other than the title match. This pairing created considerable controversy as the AQ conferences and the selection committees were accused of cowardice, pairing the two BCS Busters against each other so that the risk of AQ conference teams losing was eliminated.

In 2010, TCU was the only non–AQ conference team to get a BCS bowl berth. Boise State was ranked in the top five for most of the season, but a late-season overtime loss to Nevada knocked the Broncos out of serious contention for a BCS bowl bid, despite their continuing eligibility. TCU would defeat Wisconsin 21–19 in the 2011 Rose Bowl, once again calling into question the claim of AQ conference superiority. There was a movement to lobby those voting in the AP poll, which is not bound to vote for the BCS Championship winner as the Coaches Poll is, to vote TCU first and split the National Championship. While TCU got a few first place votes, this effort did not change the outcome of the AP poll, and TCU ended up in the No. 2 spot in all of the final major polls. As Utah had already done, TCU soon joined a conference with an automatic BCS tie, namely the Big 12 Conference (home of several other former members of the Southwest Conference, which TCU competed in for over 70 years) beginning with the 2012 season.

In 2012, Northern Illinois (NIU) became the first BCS Buster with a regular-season loss. NIU was also the first BCS Buster to qualify automatically with a ranking between 13 and 16 (and higher ranked than at least one AQ-Conference Champion); NIU was ranked higher than two AQ-Conference Champions (Big Ten and Big East). They were selected for the 2013 Orange Bowl, where they were defeated by the Florida State Seminoles, 31–10. NIU is the first BCS Buster team from a conference other than the Mountain West or Western Athletic Conferences to play in a BCS Bowl game.

BCS Busters were 5–3 in BCS bowls, and 4–2 in BCS bowls against opponents from AQ conferences. Utah and TCU joined AQ conferences after their repeated appearances as BCS Busters; Boise State, Hawaii, and NIU had not (as of January 2014).

The following table shows all 18 teams that were eligible to become BCS Busters, including the eight that succeeded. (The entries are ordered by year and sorted according to the BCS Rank within each year.)

<doc id="391481" wikidata="Q155402" url="?curid=391481" title="Ahmed Sékou Touré">
<text>Ahmed Sékou Touré (var. Sheku Turay or Ture; N&#x27;Ko: ; 9 January 1922 – 26 March 1984) was a Guinean political leader and African statesman who was the first president of Guinea from 1958 until his death in 1984. Touré was among the primary Guinean nationalists involved in gaining independence of the country from France. He would later die in the United States in 1984.

A devout Muslim from the Mandinka ethnic group, Sékou Touré was the great-grandson of the powerful Mandinka Muslim cleric Samori Ture who established an independent Islamic polity in part of West Africa. In 1960, he declared his Democratic Party of Guinea (&quot;Parti démocratique de Guinée&quot;, PDG) the only legal party in the state, and ruled from then on as a virtual dictator. He was re-elected unopposed to four seven-year terms in the absence of any legal opposition. Under his rule many people were killed, most notably at Camp Boiro.

== Childhood and family background ==
Sékou Touré was born on 9 January 1922, into a Muslim family in Faranah, French Guinea, a colony of France. Faranah is a town deep inside Guinea situated on the banks of the Niger River. He was one of seven children born to Alpha Touré and Aminata Touré, who were subsistence farmers. He was an aristocratic member of the Mandinka ethnic group. His great-grandfather was Samori Ture (Samory Touré), a noted Muslim Mandinka king who founded the Wassoulou Empire (1861–1890) in the territory of Guinea and Mali, defeating numerous small African states with his large, professionally organized and equipped army. He resisted French colonial rule until his capture in 1898, and died while held in exile in Gabon.

His father Alpha Touré was originally from the French Sudan (now Mali), and had migrated to the traditional gold mining town of Siguiri with his brothers. He eventually continued to Kankan, Kouroussa, Kissidougou, and then settled in Faranah. Aminata was not his first wife. She bore three babies, including Sékou and a brother who died in childhood, then she died giving birth to a third child, a girl named Nounkoumba. Sékou&#x27;s birth supposedly coincided with an omen - a baby elephant was brought to Faranah and presented to the French colonial authorities.

Sékou Touré attended the École Coranique (Qur&#x27;anic school) in his hometown and later a French lower-primary school in Kankan. He allegedly failed the exams to enter the École normale supérieure William Ponty for refusing to write an essay critical of his ancestor Samori Toure. He was enrolled in the Georges Poiret Technical College in Conakry in 1936 but was expelled less than a year later at the age of 15 for leading a student protest against the quality of food and quickly became involved in labor union activity. During his youth, Touré studied the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, among others.

==Politics and trade unions==

In 1940, Touré obtained a clerk&#x27;s position with the &quot;Compagnie du Niger Français&quot; while also working to complete an examination course, which would allow him to join the Post, Telegraph and Telecommunications services (French: &quot;Postes, télégraphes et téléphones&quot; (PTT)). After completing the examination course, he went on to work for the PTT as a postal clerk in Conakry in 1941. During this time, he formed connections with the French General Confederation of Labour, a communist-dominated French labor organization.

Touré first became politically active while working for the PTT. In 1945, he founded the Post and Telecommunications Workers&#x27; Union (SPTT; the first trade union in French Guinea), and he became the general secretary of the union in 1946. Also the same year, he was a founding member of the African Democratic Rally (French: &quot;Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, RDA&quot;), an alliance of political parties and affiliates in French West and Equatorial Africa.

By 1948, he was elected general secretary of the Territorial Union of the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), and two years later, he was named general secretary of the coordinating committee of the (CGT) for French West Africa and French Togoland. In the 1951 elections, he campaigned with a coalition of the RDA, the UDSR and the recently-founded Democratic Party of Guinea (&quot;Parti démocratique de Guinée&quot; or PDG, the RDA&#x27;s Guinean section); however, the coalition performed poorly.

In 1952, he became the leader of the PDG. The RDA agitated for the decolonization of Africa, and included representatives from all the French West African colonies. The party forged alliance with labor unions and Touré was elected as secretary-general.

His greatest success as a trade union leader was when workers across French Guinea went on a 71-day general strike (longer than any other territories in the French West Africa) in 1953 to force the implementation of a new overseas labor code. He was later elected to Guinea&#x27;s Territorial Assembly the same year. As a result, he was elected as one of the three secretaries-general of the French Communist Party&#x27;s Confédération Générale du Travail (General Confederation of Labour; CGT) in 1954.

The PDG-RDA under Sékou Touré&#x27;s leadership participated in the 1954 by-election, held after the death of Yacine Diallo. He lost to Diawadou Barry. The election was, however, marred with irregularities. The French minister Robert Buron admitted in 1968 that it had been rigged by France to prevent Sékou Touré from winning.
In 1957, he organized the Union Générale des Travailleurs d&#x27;Afrique Noire, a common trade union centre for French West Africa. He was a leader of the RDA, working closely with Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who later was elected as president of the Ivory Coast. In 1956, Touré was elected Guinea&#x27;s deputy to the French National Assembly and mayor of Conakry, positions he used to criticize the French colonial regime.

Touré served for some time as a representative of African groups in France, where he worked to negotiate for the independence of France&#x27;s African colonies.

In September 1958, Guinea participated in the referendum on the new Constitution of France. On acceptance of the new constitution, French overseas territories had the option of choosing to continue their existing status, to move toward full integration into metropolitan France, or to acquire the status of an autonomous republic in the new quasi-federal French Community. If, however, they rejected the new constitution, they would become independent forthwith. French President Charles de Gaulle made it clear that a country pursuing the independent course would no longer receive French economic and financial aid or retain French technical and administrative officers.

In 1958, Touré&#x27;s PDG, pushed for a &quot;No&quot; in the French Union referendum sponsored by the French government. Upon hearing of Touré&#x27;s choice on the matter, General de Gaulle responded, &quot;Then all you have to do is vote &#x27;no&#x27;. I pledge myself that nobody will stand in the way of your independence.&quot; The French also threatened to cut off all their aid to Guinea in the event that the colony voted to become independent of France. The electorate of Guinea rejected the new constitution overwhelmingly, and Guinea accordingly became an independent state on 2 October 1958, with Touré, leader of Guinea&#x27;s strongest labor union, as president. Guinea was thus the only African colony to vote for immediate independence rather than continued association with France, and hence was the only French colony to decline participation in the new French Community when it became independent in 1958. In any event, the rest of Francophone Africa gained effective independence two years later in 1960.

In response to the vote for immediate and total independence, the vindictive French settlers and colonialists in Guinea were quite dramatic in severing ties with Guinea, with many French civil servants destroying Guinean infrastructure as they departed Guinea as an act of vengeance for Guineans voting to become independent. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; observed how brutal the French were in tearing down all what they thought was their contributions to Guinea: &quot;In reaction, and as a warning to other French-speaking territories, the French pulled out of Guinea over a two-month period, taking everything they could with them. They unscrewed light bulbs, removed plans for sewage pipelines in Conakry, the capital, and even burned medicines rather than leave them for the Guineans.&quot;

==Presidency (1958–1984)==
In 1960, Touré declared the PDG to be the only legal party, though the country had effectively been a one-party state since independence. For the next 24 years, Touré effectively held all governing power in the nation. He was elected to a seven-year term as president in 1961; as leader of the PDG he was the only candidate. He was reelected unopposed in 1968, 1974 and 1982. Every five years, a single list of PDG candidates was returned to the National Assembly.

During his presidency, Touré&#x27;s policies were strongly based on socialism, with the nationalization of foreign companies and centralized economic plans. He won the Lenin Peace Prize as a result in 1961. His early actions to reject the French and then to appropriate wealth and farmland from traditional landlords angered many powerful forces, but the increasing failure of his government to provide either economic opportunities or democratic rights angered more. Famously, he stated that &quot;Guinea prefers poverty in freedom to riches in slavery.&quot;

Guineans who had fled reported that Touré&#x27;s regime &quot;practices tyranny and torture on a daily basis&quot;. His approach towards his opponents caused charges to be brought from Amnesty International (as well as other human rights organizations), accusing his rule to be too oppressive. From 1965 to 1975 Touré ended all his government&#x27;s relations with France, the former colonial power.

Touré argued that Africa had lost much during colonization, and that Africa ought to retaliate by cutting off ties to former colonial nations. However, in 1978 Guinea&#x27;s ties with the Soviet Union soured, and, as a sign of reconciliation, President of France Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing visited Guinea, the first state visit by a French president.
Throughout Touré&#x27;s dispute with France, he maintained good relations with several socialist countries. However, Touré&#x27;s attitude toward France was not generally well received by his own people and some other African countries ended diplomatic relations with Guinea over his actions. He also often voiced his distrust of other African nations. Meanwhile, some 1.5 million Guineans were fleeing Guinea to neighboring countries, such as Sierra Leone. Despite this, Touré&#x27;s position won the support of many anti-colonialist and Pan-African groups and leaders.

Touré&#x27;s primary allies in the region were presidents Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Modibo Keita of Mali. After Nkrumah was overthrown in a 1966 coup, Touré offered him asylum in Guinea and gave him the honorary title of co-president. As a leader of the Pan-Africanist movement, Touré consistently spoke out against colonial powers, and befriended African American civil rights activists such as Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael, to whom he offered asylum. Carmichael took the two leaders&#x27; names, as Kwame Ture.

His relations with Washington soured, however, after Kennedy&#x27;s death. When a Guinean delegation was imprisoned in Ghana, after the overthrow of Nkrumah, Touré blamed Washington. He feared that the Central Intelligence Agency, as well as the Soviet Union, were plotting against his own regime even though he was taking economic aid from both parties.

With Nkrumah, Touré helped in the formation of the All-African Peoples Revolutionary Party, and aided the PAIGC guerrillas in their fight against Portuguese colonialism in neighboring Portuguese Guinea. The Portuguese launched an attack upon Conakry in 1970 when some 350 men, under the leadership of Portuguese officers from Portuguese Guinea (now Guinea-Bissau), including FLNG partisans and African Portuguese soldiers, entered Guinea to rescue Portuguese prisoners of war, overthrow Touré&#x27;s regime, and destroy PAIGC bases. They succeeded in the rescue but failed to dislodge Touré&#x27;s regime. Touré directed waves of arrests, detentions, and some executions of known and suspected opposition leaders in Guinea followed this military operation.

During its first three decades of independence, Guinea developed into a militantly socialist state, which merged the functions and membership of the PDG with the various institutions of government, including the public state bureaucracy. This unified party-state had nearly complete control over the country&#x27;s economic and political life. Guinea expelled the US Peace Corps in 1966 because of their alleged involvement in a plot to overthrow President Touré. Similar charges were directed against France; diplomatic relations were severed in 1965 and Touré did not renew them until 1975. An ongoing source of contention between Guinea and its French-speaking neighbors was the estimated half-million expatriates in Senegal and Ivory Coast; some were active dissidents who, in 1966, formed the National Liberation Front of Guinea (Front de Libération Nationale de Guinée, or FLNG).

In &quot;Le Français est à nous!&quot; (&quot;French language belongs to us!&quot;), French university teachers Maria Candéa an Laélia Véron praise Touré for having made official eight local languages of Guinea. They describe his linguistic policy as &quot;très ambitieuse&quot; (very ambitious).

Between 1969 and 1976, according to Amnesty International, 4,000 persons in Guinea were detained for political reasons, with the fate of 2,900 unknown. After an alleged Fulani plot to assassinate Touré was disclosed in May 1976, Diallo Telli, a cabinet minister and formerly the first secretary-general of the OAU, was arrested and sent to prison. He died without trial in November of that year.

In 1977, protests against the regime&#x27;s economic policy, which dealt harshly with unauthorized trading, led to riots in which three regional governors were killed. Touré responded by relaxing restrictions on trading, offering amnesty to exiles (thousands of whom returned), and releasing hundreds of political prisoners. Relations with the Soviet bloc grew cooler, as Touré sought to increase Western aid and private investment for Guinea&#x27;s sagging economy.

He imprisoned or exiled his strongest opposition leaders. Over time, Touré arrested large numbers of suspected political opponents and imprisoned them in concentration camps, such as the notorious Camp Boiro. Following the discovery of mass graves in 2002, reports of 50,000 people being killed under the regime of Touré were widely disseminated by groups such as the Camp Boiro Memorial organization. Other estimates by scholars and international agencies report significantly lower casualties, with a US House of Representatives report placing the number around 5000.

Domestically, Sékou Touré pursued socialist economic policies, including nationalizations of banks, energy and transportation; in foreign affairs, he joined the Non-Aligned Movement and developed very close relations with Mao Zedong and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Once Guinea began its rapprochement with France in the late 1970s, Marxists among Touré&#x27;s supporters began to oppose his government&#x27;s shift toward capitalist liberalisation. In 1978, Touré formally renounced Marxism and reestablished trade with the West.

Single-list elections for an expanded National Assembly were held in 1980. Touré was elected unopposed to a fourth seven-year term as president on 9 May 1982. A new constitution was adopted that month, and during the summer Touré visited the United States. While in Washington, Touré urged for more American private investment in Guinea, and claimed that the country had &quot;fabulous economic potential&quot; due to its mineral reserves. This was taken by US diplomats to be a confession of the failure of Marxism. It was part of his economic policy change that led him to seek Western investment in order to develop Guinea&#x27;s huge mineral reserves. At the same time, however, the annual average income of Guineans was US$140 (), life expectancy was only at 41 years, and the literacy rate was only 10%. Measures announced in 1983 brought further economic liberalization, including the delegation of produce marketing to private traders.

==Death==

Touré died of an apparent heart attack on 26 March 1984 while undergoing cardiac treatment in the United States, at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, for emergency heart surgery; he had been rushed to the United States after being stricken in Saudi Arabia the previous day. Touré&#x27;s tomb is at the Camayanne Mausoleum, situated within the gardens of the Grand Mosque of Conakry.

Prime Minister Louis Lansana Béavogui became acting president, pending elections that were to be held within 45 days. The Political Bureau of the ruling Guinea Democratic Party was due to name its choice as Touré&#x27;s successor on 3 April 1984. Under the constitution, the PDG&#x27;s new leader would have been automatically elected to a seven-year term as president and confirmed in office by the voters by the end of spring. Just hours before that meeting took place, the military seized power in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. They denounced the last years of Touré&#x27;s rule as a &quot;bloody and ruthless dictatorship.&quot; The constitution was suspended, the National Assembly dissolved, and the PDG abolished. Colonel Lansana Conté, leader of the coup, assumed the presidency on 5 April, heading the Military Committee of National Restoration (&quot;Comité Militaire de Redressement National&quot;—CMRN). The military junta freed about 1,000 political prisoners.

In 1985 Conté took advantage of an alleged coup attempt to arrest and execute several of Sékou Touré&#x27;s close associates, including Ismael Touré, Mamadi Keïta, Siaka Touré, former commander of Camp Boiro; and Moussa Diakité.

== Desecration of Touré&#x27;s tomb ==
On July 14, 2020, his grave was desecrated by an unknown person. According to a relative of the CEO of the GDR who went to the scene of the desecration, the individual set fire to the tricolor which was in the grave. Then he began to pour liquid into the burial place. The next day his widow lamented the act of desecration. She herself clarified that the mausoleum belongs to her clan and that it is abandoned without security, she considered hiring security personnel.

<doc id="391486" wikidata="Q392719" url="?curid=391486" title="Shuttarna II">
<text>Shuttarna II (or Šuttarna) was a king of the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni in the early 14th century BC.

==Family==
Shuttarna II was the successor and probably a son of Artatama I.

He was succeeded by his sons, Artashumara, under dubious circumstances, then Tushratta.

==Reign==
During the reign of Shuttarna, the kingdom of Mitanni reached its height of power and prosperity. From Alalakh in the west, Mitanni shared its border with Egypt in northern Syria, approximately by the river Orontes. Two tablets sealed by Shuttarna were found at Tall Bazi on the Euphrates. Other tablets sealed by him were found at Alalakh, Tell Brak, Nuzi and Umm el-Marra. The heart of the kingdom was in the Khabur River basin where the capital Washshukanni was situated. Assyria as well as Arrapha in the east were vassal kingdoms of Mitanni. The Hittites attempted to invade the northern border lands of Mitanni, but were defeated by Shuttarna.

===Egypt===
He was an ally of the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III and the diplomatic dealings of the kings are briefly recorded in the Amarna letters EA#182, EA#183 and EA#184. Shuttarna&#x27;s daughter Kilu-Hepa (sometimes spelled Gilukhepa) was given to Amenhotep III in marriage to seal the alliance between the two royal houses in the Pharaoh&#x27;s 10th regnal year, taking with her a great dowry.

<doc id="391487" wikidata="Q1505372" url="?curid=391487" title="Job Control Language">
<text>Job Control Language (JCL) is a scripting language used on IBM mainframe operating systems to instruct the system on how to run a batch job or start a subsystem. The purpose of JCL is to say which programs to run, using which files or devices for input or output, and at times to also indicate under what conditions to skip a step. Parameters in the JCL can also provide accounting information for tracking the resources used by a job as well as which machine the job should run on.

There are two distinct IBM Job Control Languages: 
* one for the operating system lineage that begins with DOS/360 and whose latest member is z/VSE; and 
* the other for the lineage from OS/360 to z/OS, the latter now including JES extensions, Job &quot;Entry&quot; Control Language (JECL).

They share some basic syntax rules and a few basic concepts, but are otherwise very different. 

The VM operating system does not have JCL as such; the CP and CMS components each have command languages.

==Terminology==
Certain words or phrases used in conjunction to JCL are specific to IBM mainframe technology.
* Dataset: a &quot;dataset&quot; is a file; it can be temporary or permanent, and located on a disk drive, tape storage, or other device.
* Member: a &quot;member&quot; of a partitioned dataset (PDS) is an individual dataset within a PDS. A member can be accessed by specifying the name of the PDS with the member name in parentheses. For example, the system macro GETMAIN in SYS1.MACLIB can be referenced as SYS1.MACLIB(GETMAIN). 
* Partitioned dataset: a &quot;partitioned dataset&quot; or PDS is collection of members, or archive. Partitioned datasets are commonly used to store textual data such as source code, assembler macros (SYS1.MACLIB), system configuration (SYS1.PARMLIB), reusable JCL procedures (SYS1.PROCLIB), etc. As such, they have something in common with archive files (ZIP, TAR, etc) and with directories in other operating systems. They are also used to store binary code (load modules or program objects); in that guise, they are roughly analogous to ar-based static libraries in Unix-based systems. As with most such structures, a member, once stored, cannot be updated; the member must be deleted and replaced, such as with the IEBUPDTE utility. Since the 1989 release of MVS DFP 3.2, PDSEs (Partitioned Data Set Extended) have existed as an improved version of PDS; from the user or application programmer viewpoint, they are largely unchanged (save the removal of some obscure legacy features), but their internal implementation is very different.
* USS: Unix system services, a complete Unix environment running as part of the MVS base control program, and allowing Unix files, scripts, tasks, and programs to run on a mainframe in a fully POSIX compliant Unix environment without virtualization.

==Motivation==
Originally, mainframe systems were oriented toward batch processing. Many batch jobs require setup, with specific requirements for main storage, and dedicated devices such as magnetic tapes, private disk volumes, and printers set up with special forms. JCL was developed as a means of ensuring that all required resources are available before a job is scheduled to run. For example, many systems, such as Linux allow identification of required datasets to be specified on the command line, and therefore subject to substitution by the shell, or generated by the program at run-time.

On these systems the operating system job scheduler has little or no idea of the requirements of the job. In contrast, JCL explicitly specifies all required datasets and devices. The scheduler can pre-allocate the resources prior to releasing the job to run. This helps to avoid &quot;deadlock&quot;, where job A holds resource R1 and requests resource R2, while concurrently running job B holds resource R2 and requests R1. In such cases the only solution is for the computer operator to terminate one of the jobs, which then needs to be restarted. With job control, if job A is scheduled to run, job B will not be started until job A completes or releases the required resources.

==Features common to DOS and OS JCL==

===Jobs, steps and procedures===
For both DOS and OS the unit of work is the job. A job consists of one or several steps, each of which is a request to run one specific program. For example, before the days of relational databases, a job to produce a printed report for management might consist of the following steps: a user-written program to select the appropriate records and copy them to a temporary file; sort the temporary file into the required order, usually using a general-purpose utility; a user-written program to present the information in a way that is easy for the end-users to read and includes other useful information such as sub-totals; and a user-written program to format selected pages of the end-user information for display on a monitor or terminal.

In both DOS and OS JCL the first &quot;card&quot; must be the JOB card, which: 
* Identifies the job.
* Usually provides information to enable the computer services department to bill the appropriate user department.
* Defines how the job as a whole is to be run, e.g. its priority relative to other jobs in the queue.

Procedures (commonly called &quot;procs&quot;) are pre-written JCL for steps or groups of steps, inserted into a job. Both JCLs allow such procedures. Procs are used for repeating steps which are used several times in one job, or in several different jobs. They save programmer time and reduce the risk of errors. To run a procedure one simply includes in the JCL file a single &quot;card&quot; which copies the procedure from a specified file, and inserts it into the jobstream. Also, procs can include &quot;parameters&quot; to customize the procedure for each use.

===Basic syntax===
Both DOS and OS JCL have a maximum usable line length of 80 characters, because when DOS/360 and OS/360 were first used the main method of providing new input to a computer system was 80-column punched cards. It later became possible to submit jobs via disk or tape files with longer record lengths, but the operating system&#x27;s job submission components ignored everything after character 80.

Strictly speaking both operating system families use only 71 characters per line. Characters 73-80 are usually card sequence numbers which the system printed on the end-of-job report and are useful for identifying the locations of any errors reported by the operating system. Character 72 is usually left blank, but it can contain a nonblank character to indicate that the JCL statement is continued onto the next card.

All commands, parameter names and values have to be in capitals, except for USS filenames.

All lines except for in-stream input (see below) have to begin with a slash &quot;codice_1&quot;, and all lines which the operating system processes have to begin with two slashes codice_2 - always starting in the &quot;first column&quot;. However, there are two exceptions: the delimiter statement and the comment statement. A delimiter statements begins with a slash and an asterisk (codice_3), and a comment statement in OS JCL begins with a pair of slashes and asterisk (codice_4) or an asterisk in DOS JCL.

Many JCL statements are too long to fit within 71 characters, but can be extended on to an indefinite number of continuation cards by:
The structure of the most common types of card is:
===In-stream input===
DOS and OS JCL both allow in-stream input, i.e. &quot;cards&quot; which are to be processed by the application program rather than the operating system. Data which is to be kept for a long time will normally be stored on disk, but before the use of interactive terminals became common the only way to create and edit such disk files was by supplying the new data on cards.

DOS and OS JCL have different ways of signaling the start of in-stream input, but both end in-stream input with codice_3 at column 1 of the card following the last in-stream data card. This makes the operating system resume processing JCL in the card following the codice_3 card.

*OS JCL: DD statements can be used to describe in-stream data, as well as data sets. A DD statement dealing with in-stream data has an asterisk (*) following the DD identifier, e.g. codice_7. JCL statements can be included as part of in-stream data by using the DD DATA statements.
:An operand named DLM allowed specifying a delimiter (default is &quot;/*&quot;). Specifying an alternate delimiter allows JCL to be read as data, for example to copy procedures to a library member or to submit a job to the &quot;internal reader&quot;.
:*An example, which submits a job to the &quot;Internal Reader&quot; (INTRDR) and then deletes two files is:

//SUBM EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=Z
//SYSUT2 DD SYSOUT=(A,INTRDR)
//SYSIN DD DUMMY
//SYSUT1 DD DATA,DLM=ZZ
//RUNLATR JOB ACCT,MANIX,CLASS=A.TYPRUN=HOLD
//* ^ a JOB to run later
//CPUHOG EXEC PGM=PICALC1K
//OUTPUT DD DSN=PICALC.1000DGTS,SPACE=(TRK,1),DISP=(,KEEP)
ZZ
//* ^ as specified by DLM=ZZ
//DROPOLDR EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
//DELETE4 DD DSN=PICALC.4DGTS,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)
//DELETE5 DD DSN=PICALC.5DGTS,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)

::# The program called PICALC1K will await (TYPRUN=HOLD) being released manually
::# The program called IEFBR14 will run NOW and upon completion, the two existing files, PICALC.4DGTS and PICALC.5DGTS will be deleted.

*DOS JCL: Simply enter the in-stream data after the EXEC card for the program.

===Complexity===
Fred Brooks, who supervised the OS/360 project in which JCL was created, called it &quot;the worst computer programming language ever devised by anybody, anywhere&quot; in The Design of Design, where he used it as the example in the chapter &quot;How Expert Designers Go Wrong&quot;. He attributed this to the failure of the designers to realize that JCL is, in fact, a programming language.

Much of the complexity of OS JCL, in particular, derives from the large number of options for specifying dataset information. While files on Unix-like operating systems are abstracted into ordered streams of bytes, with the task of reading and writing structured data belonging exclusively with user-level programs (which, ultimately, ingest and emit such streams), and the practical details of data storage and access handled in large part by the operating system without the knowledge of user programs; datasets on OS/360 and its successors expose their file types and sizes, record types and lengths, block sizes, device-specific information like magnetic tape density, and label information. Although there are system defaults for many options, there is still a lot to be specified by the programmer, through a combination of JCL and information coded in the program. The more information coded in the program, the less flexible it is, since information in the program overrides anything in the JCL; thus, most information is usually supplied through JCL.
For example, to copy a file on Unix operating system, the user would enter a command like:
 cp oldFile newFile

The following example, using JCL, might be used to copy a file on OS/360:

//IS198CPY JOB (IS198T30500),&#x27;COPY JOB&#x27;,CLASS=L,MSGCLASS=X
//COPY01 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT1 DD DSN=OLDFILE,DISP=SHR
//SYSUT2 DD DSN=NEWFILE,
// DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
// SPACE=(CYL,(40,5),RLSE),
// DCB=(LRECL=115,BLKSIZE=1150)
//SYSIN DD DUMMY
A second explanation for the complexity of JCL is the different expectations for running a job from those found in a PC or Unix-like environment.
*Low-end System/360 CPUs were less powerful and more expensive than the mid-1980s PCs for which MS-DOS was designed. OS/360 was intended for systems with a minimum memory size of 32 KB and DOS/360 for systems with a minimum of 16 KB. A 360/30 CPU—low-end when System/360 was announced in 1964—processed 1.8K to 34.5K instructions per second. The first IBM PC in 1981 had 16 KB or 64 KB of memory and would process about 330K instructions per second. As a result, JCL had to be easy for the &quot;computer&quot; to process, and ease of use by programmers was a much lower priority. In this era, programmers were much cheaper than computers.
*JCL was designed for batch processing. As such, it has to tell the operating system everything, including what to do depending on the result of a step. For example, codice_8 means &quot;if the program runs successfully, create a new file and catalog it; otherwise delete the new file.&quot; Programs run on a PC frequently depend on the user to clean up after processing problems.
*System/360 machines were designed to be shared by all the users in an organization. So the codice_9 card tells the operating system how to bill the user&#x27;s account (codice_10), what predefined amount of storage and other resources may be allocated (codice_11), and several other things. codice_12 tells the computer to print the program&#x27;s report on the default printer which is loaded with ordinary paper, not on some other printer which might be loaded with blank checks. codice_13 tells the operating system that other programs can read codice_14at the same time.

Later versions of the DOS/360 and OS/360 operating systems retain most features of the original JCL—although some simplification has been made, to avoid forcing customers to rewrite all their JCL files. Many users save as a &quot;procedure&quot; any set of JCL statements which is likely to be used more than once or twice.

The syntax of OS JCL is similar to the syntax of macros in System/360 assembly language, and would therefore have been familiar to programmers at a time when many programs were coded in assembly language.

==DOS JCL==

===Positional parameters===

//TLBL TAPEFIL,&#x27;COPYTAPE.JOB&#x27;,,2
//ASSGN SYS005,200
//DLBL DISKFIL,&#x27;COPYTAPE.JOB&#x27;,0,SD
//EXTENT SYS005,VOL01,1,0,800,1600
DOS JCL parameters are positional, which makes them harder to read and write, but easier for the system to parse.
* The programmer must remember which item goes in which position in every type of statement.
* If some optional parameters are omitted but later ones are included, the omitted parameters must be represented by commas with no spaces, as in the TLBL statement above.

DOS JCL to some extent mitigates the difficulties of positional parameters by using more statements with fewer parameters than OS JCL. In the example the ASSGN, DLBL and EXTENT statements do the same work (specifying where a new disk file should be stored) as a single codice_15 statement in OS JCL.

===Device dependence===
In the original DOS/360 and in most versions of DOS/VS one had to specify the model number of the device which was to be used for each disk or tape file—even for existing files and for temporary files which would be deleted at the end of the job. This meant that, if a customer upgraded to more modern equipment, many JCL files had to be changed.

Later members of the DOS/360 family reduced the number of situations in which device model numbers were required.

===Manual file allocation===
DOS/360 originally required the programmer to specify the location and size of all files on DASD. The codice_16 card specifies the volume on which the extent resides, the starting absolute track, and the number of tracks. For z/VSE a file can have up to 256 extents on different volumes.

==OS JCL==
OS JCL consists of three basic statement types:
* codice_9 statement, which identifies the start of the job, and information about the whole job, such as billing, run priority, and time and space limits.
* codice_18 statement, which identifies the program or &quot;procedure&quot; to be executed in this step of the job,&lt;br&gt; and information about the step, including &quot;COND&quot;itions for running or skipping a step.
* codice_15 (Data Definition) statements, which identify a data file to be used in a step, and detailed info about that file. codice_15 statements can be in any order within the step.

Right from the start, JCL for the OS family (up to and including z/OS) was more flexible and easier to use.

The following examples use the old style of syntax which was provided right from the launch of System/360 in 1964. The old syntax is still quite common in jobs that have been running for decades with only minor changes.

===Rules for coding JCL statements===

Each JCL statement is divided into five fields:

 Identifier-Field Name-Field Operation-Field Parameter-Field Comments-Field
 no space space space space

Identifier-Field should be concatenated with Name-Field, i.e. there should be no spaces between them.

* Identifier-Field (codice_2): The identifier field indicates to the system that a statement is a JCL statement rather than data. The identifier field consists of the following:
** Columns 1 and 2 of all JCL statements, except the delimiter statement, contain codice_2
** Columns 1 and 2 of the delimiter statement contain codice_3
** Columns 1, 2, and 3 of a JCL comment statement contain codice_4
* Name-Field: The name field identifies a particular statement so that other statements and the system can refer to it. For JCL statements, it should be coded as follows:
** The name must begin in column 3.
** The name is 1 through 8 alphanumeric or national (codice_25, codice_26, codice_27) characters.
** The first character must be an alphabetic.
** The name must be followed by at least one blank.
* Operation-Field: The operation field specifies the type of statement, or, for the command statement, the command. Operation-Field should be coded as follows:
** The operation field consists of the characters in the syntax box for the statement.
** The operation follows the name field.
** The operation must be preceded and followed by at least one blank.
** The operation will be one of codice_9, codice_18 and codice_15.
* Parameter-Field: The parameter field, also sometimes referred to as the operand field, contains parameters separated by commas. Parameter field should be coded as follows:
** The parameter field follows the operation field.
** The parameter field must be preceded by at least one blank.
** The parameter field contains parameters which are keywords that used in the statement to provide information such as the program or dataset name.
* Comments-Field: This contains comments. Comments-Field should be coded as Follows:
** The comments field follows the parameter field.
** The comments field must be preceded by at least one blank.

===Keyword parameters===

//NEWFILE DD DSN=MYFILE01,UNIT=DISK,SPACE=(TRK,80,10),
// DCB=(LRECL=100,BLKSIZE=1000),
// DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE)

All of the major parameters of OS JCL statements are identified by keywords and can be presented in any order. A few of these contain two or more sub-parameters, such as codice_31 (how much disk space to allocate to a new file) and codice_32 (detailed specification of a file&#x27;s layout) in the example above. Sub-parameters are sometimes positional, as in codice_31, but the most complex parameters, such as codice_32, have keyword sub-parameters.

Positional parameter must precede keyword parameters. Keyword parameters always assign values to a keyword using the equals sign (codice_35).

===Data access (DD statement)===
The codice_15 statement is used to reference data. This statement links a program&#x27;s internal description of a dataset to the data on external devices: disks, tapes, cards, printers, etc. The DD may provide information such as a device type (e.g. &#x27;181&#x27;,&#x27;2400-5&#x27;,&#x27;TAPE&#x27;), a volume serial number for tapes or disks, and the description of the data file, called the codice_32 subparameter after the Data Control Block (DCB) in the program used to identify the file.

Information describing the file can come from three sources: The DD card information, the dataset label information for an existing file stored on tape or disk, and the DCB macro coded in the program. When the file is opened this data is merged, with the DD information taking precedence over the label information, and the DCB information taking precedence over both. The updated description is then written back to the dataset label. This can lead to unintended consequences if incorrect DCB information is provided.

Because of the parameters listed above and specific information for various access methods and devices the DD statement is the most complex JCL statement. In one IBM reference manual description of the DD statement occupies over 130 pages—more than twice as much as the JOB and EXEC statements combined.

The DD statement allows inline data to be injected into the job stream. This is useful for providing control information to utilities such as IDCAMS, SORT, etc. as well as providing input data to programs.

===Device independence===
From the very beginning, the JCL for the OS family of operating systems offered a high degree of device independence. Even for new files which were to be kept after the end of the job one could specify the device type in generic terms, e.g., codice_38, codice_39, or codice_40 (tape or disk). Of course, if it mattered one could specify a model number or even a specific device address.

===Procedures===
Procedures permit grouping one or more &quot;&quot;EXEC PGM=&quot; and &quot;DD&quot; statements and then invoking them with &quot;EXEC PROC=&quot;procname&quot; -or- simply &quot;EXEC procname&quot; 

A facility called a Procedure Library allowed pre-storing procedures.

====PROC &amp; PEND====
Procedures can also be included in the job stream by terminating the procedure with a codice_41 statement, then invoking it by name the same was as if it were in a procedure library.

For example:

//SUMPRINT PROC 
//PRINT EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
//SYSUT1 DD DSN=CEO.FILES.DAYEND.RPT24A,DISP=SHR
//SYSUT2 DD SYSOUT=A
//SYSIN DD DUMMY
// PEND
// EXEC SUMPRINT
===Parameterized procedures===
OS JCL procedures were parameterized from the start, making them rather like macros or even simple subroutines and thus increasing their reusability in a wide range of situations.

//MYPROC PROC FNAME=MYFILE01,SPTYPE=TRK,SPINIT=50,SPEXT=10,LR=100,BLK=1000
//NEWFILE DD DSN=&amp;FNAME,UNIT=DISK,SPACE=(&amp;SPTYPE,&amp;SPINIT,&amp;SPEXT),
// DCB=(LRECL=&amp;LR,BLKSIZE=&amp;BLK),DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE)

In this example, all the values beginning with ampersands &quot;codice_42&quot; are parameters which will be specified when a job requests that the procedure be used. The PROC statement, in addition to giving the procedure a name, allows the programmer to specify default values for each parameter. So one could use the one procedure in this example to create new files of many different sizes and layouts. For example:

//JOB01 JOB ...
//STEP01 EXEC MYPROC FNAME=JOESFILE,SPTYPE=CYL,SPINIT=10,SPEXT=2,LR=100,BLK=2000
or
//JOB02 JOB ...
//STEP01 EXEC MYPROC FNAME=SUESFILE,SPTYPE=TRK,SPINIT=500,SPEXT=100,LR=100,BLK=5000
===Referbacks===
In multi-step jobs, a later step can use a &quot;referback&quot; instead of specifying in full a file which has already been specified in an earlier step. For example:

//MYPROC ...
//MYPR01 EXEC PGM=...
//NEWFILE DD DSN=&amp;MYFILE,UNIT=DISK,SPACE=(TRK,50,10),
// DCB=(LRECL=100,BLKSIZE=1000),DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE)
//MYPR02 EXEC PGM=...
//INPUT01 DD DSN=*.MYPR01.NEWFILE
Here, codice_43 uses the file identified as codice_44 in step codice_45 (codice_46 means &quot;dataset name&quot; and specifies the name of the file; a DSN could not exceed 44 characters).

In jobs which contain a mixture of job-specific JCL and procedure calls, a job-specific step can refer back to a file which was fully specified in a procedure, for example:

//MYJOB JOB ...
//STEP01 EXEC MYPROC Using a procedure
//STEP02 EXEC PGM=... Step which is specific to this job
//INPUT01 DD DSN=*.STEP01.MYPR01.NEWFILE

where codice_47 means &quot;use the file identified as codice_44 in step codice_45 of the procedure used by step codice_50 of this job&quot;. Using the name of the step which called the procedure rather than the name of the procedure allows a programmer to use the same procedure several times in the same job without confusion about which instance of the procedure is used in the referback.

===Comments===
JCL files can be long and complex, and the language is not easy to read. OS JCL allows programmers to include two types of explanatory comment:
*On the same line as a JCL statement. They can be extended by placing a continuation character (conventionally &quot;codice_51&quot;) in column 72, followed by &quot;codice_52&quot; in columns 1–3 of the next line.
*Lines which contain only comment, often used to explain major points about the overall structure of the JCL rather than local details. Comment-only lines are also used to divide long, complex JCL files into sections.

//MYJOB JOB ...
//* Lines containing only comments.
//******** Often used to divide JCL listing into sections ********
//STEP01 EXEC MYPROC Comment 2 on same line as statement
//STEP02 EXEC PGM=... Comment 3 has been extended and X
// overflows into another line.
//INPUT01 DD DSN=STEP01.MYPR01.NEWFILE
===Concatenating input files===
OS JCL allows programmers to concatenate (&quot;chain&quot;) input files so that they appear to the program as &quot;one&quot; file, for example
//INPUT01 DD DSN=MYFILE01,DISP=SHR
// DD DSN=JOESFILE,DISP=SHR
// DD DSN=SUESFILE,DISP=SHR
The 2nd and third statements have no value in the name field, so OS treats them as concatenations. The files must be of the same basic type (almost always sequential), and must have the same record length, however the block length need not be the same.

In early versions of the OS (certainly before OS/360 R21.8) the block length must be in decreasing order, or the user must inspect each instance and append to the named DD statement the maximum block length found, as in, for example,
//INPUT01 DD DSN=MYFILE01,DISP=SHR,BLKSIZE=800
// DD DSN=JOESFILE,DISP=SHR (BLKSIZE assumed to be equal to or less than 800)
// DD DSN=SUESFILE,DISP=SHR (BLKSIZE assumed to be equal to or less than 800)
In later versions of the OS (certainly after OS/MVS R3.7 with the appropriate &quot;selectable units&quot;) the OS itself, during allocation, would inspect each instance in a concatenation and would substitute the maximum block length which was found.

A usual fallback was to simply determine the maximum possible block length on the device, and specify that on the named DD statement, as in, for example,
//INPUT01 DD DSN=MYFILE01,DISP=SHR,BLKSIZE=8000
// DD DSN=JOESFILE,DISP=SHR (BLKSIZE assumed to be equal to or less than 8000)
// DD DSN=SUESFILE,DISP=SHR (BLKSIZE assumed to be equal to or less than 8000)
The purpose of this fallback was to ensure that the access method would allocate an input buffer set which was large enough to accommodate any and all of the specified datasets.

===Conditional processing===
OS expects programs to set a return code which specifies how successful the &quot;program&quot; thought it was. The most common conventional values are:
*0 = Normal - all OK
*4 = Warning - minor errors or problems
*8 = Error - significant errors or problems
*12 = Severe error - major errors or problems, the results (e.g. files or reports produced) should not be trusted.
*16 = Terminal error - very serious problems, do not use the results!

OS JCL refers to the return code as codice_53 (&quot;condition code&quot;), and can use it to decide whether to run subsequent steps. However, unlike most modern programming languages, conditional steps in OS JCL are &quot;not&quot; executed if the specified condition is true—thus giving rise to the mnemonic, &quot;If it&#x27;s true, pass on through [without running the code].&quot; To complicate matters further, the condition can only be specified &quot;after&quot; the step to which it refers. For example:

//MYJOB JOB ...
//STEP01 EXEC PGM=PROG01
//STEP02 EXEC PGM=PROG02,COND=(4,GT,STEP01)
//STEP03 EXEC PGM=PROG03,COND=(8,LE)
//STEP04 EXEC PGM=PROG04,COND=(ONLY,STEP01)
//STEP05 EXEC PGM=PROG05,COND=(EVEN,STEP03)

means:
# Run codice_50, and collect its return code.
# Don&#x27;t run codice_55 if the number 4 is greater than codice_50&#x27;s return code.
# Don&#x27;t run codice_57 if the number 8 is less than or equal to any previous return code.
# Run codice_58 only if codice_50 abnormally ended.
# Run codice_60, even if codice_57 abnormally ended.

This translates to the following pseudocode:
 run STEP01
 if STEP01&#x27;s return code is greater than or equal to 4 then
 run STEP02
 end if
 if any previous return code is less than 8 then
 run STEP03
 end if
 if STEP01 abnormally ended then
 run STEP04
 end if
 if STEP03 abnormally ended then
 run STEP05
 else
 run STEP05
 end if

Note that by reading the steps containing codice_53 statements backwards, one can understand them fairly easily. This is an example of logical transposition.
However, IBM later introduced IF condition in JCL thereby making coding somewhat easier for programmers while retaining the codice_53 parameter (to avoid making changes to the existing JCLs where is used).

The codice_53 parameter may also be specified on the codice_9 statement. If so the system &quot;performs the same return code tests for every step in a job. If a JOB statement return code test is satisfied, the job terminates.&quot;

===Utilities===
Jobs use a number of IBM utility programs to assist in the processing of data. Utilities are most useful in batch processing. The utilities can be grouped into three sets:
* Data Set Utilities - Create, print, copy, move and delete data sets.
* System Utilities - Maintain and manage catalogs and other system information.
* Access Method Services - Process Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) and non-VSAM data sets.

===Difficulty of use===
OS JCL is undeniably complex and has been described as &quot;user hostile&quot;. As one instructional book on JCL asked, &quot;Why do even sophisticated programmers hesitate when it comes to Job Control Language?&quot; The book stated that many programmers either copied control cards without really understanding what they did, or &quot;believed the prevalent rumors that JCL was horrible, and only &#x27;die-hard&#x27; computer-types ever understood it&quot; and handed the task of figuring out the JCL statements to someone else. Such an attitude could be found in programming language textbooks, which preferred to focus on the language itself and not how programs in it were run. As one Fortran IV textbook said when listing possible error messages from the WATFOR compiler: &quot;Have you been so foolish as to try to write your own &#x27;DD&#x27; system control cards? Cease and desist forthwith; run, do not walk, for help.&quot;

Nevertheless, some books that went into JCL in detail emphasized that once it was learned to an at least somewhat proficient degree, one gained freedom from installation-wide defaults and much better control over how an IBM system processed your workload. Another book commented on the complexity but said, &quot;take heart. The JCL capability you will gain from [the preceding chapter] is all that most programmers will ever need.&quot;

==Job Entry Control Language==
On IBM mainframe systems &quot;Job Entry Control Language&quot; or &quot;JECL&quot; is the set of command language control statements that provide information for the spooling subsystem – JES2 or JES3 on z/OS or VSE/POWER for z/VSE. JECL statements may &quot;specify on which network computer to run the job, when to run the job, and where to send the resulting output.&quot;

JECL is distinct from job control language (JCL), which instructs the operating system &quot;how&quot; to run the job.

There are different versions of JECL for the three environments.

===OS/360===
An early version of Job Entry Control Language for OS/360 Remote Job Entry (Program Number 360S-RC-536) used the identifier  codice_66  in columns 1–2 of the input record and consisted of a single control statement: codice_67 (Job Entry Definition). &quot;Workstation Commands&quot; such as codice_68, codice_69, and codice_70 also began with  codice_66 .

====pre-JES JECL====
Although the term had not yet been developed, HASP did have similar functionality to what would become the JECL of JES, including codice_3 syntax.

===z/OS===
For JES2 JECL statements start with codice_3, for JES3 they start with codice_4, except for remote  codice_75  and  codice_76  commands. The commands for the two systems are completely different.

====JES2 JECL====
The following JES2 JECL statements are used in z/OS 1.2.0.

====JES3 JECL====
The following JES3 JECL statements are used in z/OS 1.2.0

===z/VSE===
For VSE JECL statements start with &#x27;codice_77&#x27; (note the &quot;single&quot; space). The Job Entry Control Language defines the start and end lines of JCL jobs. It advises VSE/POWER how this job is handled. JECL statements define the job name (used by VSE/POWER), the class in which the job is processed, and the disposition of the job (i.e. codice_78, codice_79, codice_80, codice_81).

Example:

* $$ JOB JNM=NAME,DISP=K,CLASS=2

[some JCL statements here]

* $$ EOJ
==Other systems==
Other mainframe batch systems had some form of job control language, whether called that or not; their syntax was completely different from IBM versions, but they usually provided similar capabilities. Interactive systems 
include &quot;command languages&quot;—command files (such as PCDOS &quot;.bat&quot; files) can be run non-interactively, but these usually do not provide as robust an environment for running unattended jobs as JCL. On some computer systems the job control language and the interactive command language may be different. For example, TSO on z/OS systems uses CLIST or Rexx as command languages along with JCL for batch work. On other systems these may be the same.

<doc id="391488" wikidata="Q643348" url="?curid=391488" title="Habib Bourguiba">
<text>Habib Bourguiba ( ; ; ; 3 August 19036 April 2000) was a Tunisian lawyer, nationalist leader and statesman who led the country from 1956 to 1957 as the prime minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia (1956–1957) then as the first president of Tunisia (1957–1987). Prior to his presidency, he led the nation to independence from France, ending the 75-year-old protectorate and earning the title of &quot;Supreme Combatant&quot;.

Born in Monastir to a poor family, he attended Sadiki College and Lycée Carnot in Tunis before obtaining his baccalaureate in 1924. He graduated from the University of Paris and the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po) in 1927 and returned to Tunis to practice law. In the early 1930s, he became involved in anti-colonial and Tunisian national politics, joining the Destour party and co-founding the Neo Destour in 1934. He became a key figure of the independence movement and was repeatedly arrested by the colonial administration. His involvement in the riots of 9 April 1938 resulted in his exile to Marseille during World War II. 
In 1945, following Bourguiba&#x27;s release, he moved to Cairo, Egypt to seek the support of the Arab League. He returned to Tunisia in 1949 and rose to prominence as the leader of the national movement. Although initially committed to peaceful negotiations with the French government, he had an effective role in the armed unrest that started in 1952 when they proved to be unsuccessful. He was arrested and imprisoned on La Galite Island for two years, before being exiled in France. There, he led negotiations with Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France and obtained internal autonomy agreements in exchange for the end of the unrest. Bourguiba returned victorious to Tunis on 1 June 1955, but was challenged by Salah Ben Youssef for the party leader position. Ben Youssef and his supporters disagreed with Bourguiba&#x27;s &quot;soft&quot; policies and demanded full independence of the Maghreb. This resulted in a civil war that pitted Bourguibists, who favored a gradual policy and modernism, against Youssefists, the conservative Arab nationalist supporters of Ben Youssef. The conflict ended in favor of Bourguiba with the Sfax Congress of 1955.

Following the country&#x27;s independence in 1956, Bourguiba was appointed prime minister by king Muhammad VIII al-Amin and acted as &quot;de facto&quot; ruler before proclaiming the Republic on 25 July 1957. He was elected interim President of Tunisia by Parliament until the ratification of the Constitution. During his rule, he implemented a strong education system, worked on developing the economy, supported gender equality, and proclaimed a neutral foreign policy, making him an exception among Arab leaders. The main reform that was passed was the Code of Personal Status which implemented a modern society. He established a strong presidential system which turned into a twenty-year one-party state dominated by his own party, the Socialist Destourian Party. A cult of personality also developed around him, before he proclaimed himself president for life in 1975, during his fourth 5-year term.

The end of his 30-year rule was marked by his declining health, a war of succession, and the rise of clientelism and Islamism. On 7 November 1987, he was removed from power by his prime minister, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, and kept under house arrest in a residence in Monastir. He remained there until his death and was buried in a mausoleum he had previously built.

== 1903–1930: Early life ==

=== Childhood years ===

Bourguiba was born in Monastir, the eighth child and final son of Ali Bourguiba and Fatouma Khefacha. Bourguiba&#x27;s official birthdate is 3 August 1903, though he stated he was likely born a year earlier, on 3 August 1902, or possibly 1901. Bourguiba&#x27;s mother gave birth to him when she was 40, which, according to Bourguiba, was a source of great shame for her. His father, who was 53 years old, wondered whether he could raise him properly. Despite financial hardship, Ali Bourguiba gave great importance to the education of his children. He was enrolled in the army by general Ahmed Zarrouk, and spent nineteen years of his life campaigning before retiring. Eager to avoid such a fate for his last child, he decided to ensure Habib obtained his &quot;Certificat d&#x27;études primaires&quot;, which would dispense him from military service, just like his elder sons. Around the time Bourguiba was born, his father became councilman, and was, therefore, part of the notables of the city. This allowed him to improve both his financial and social situation and permitted him to provide a modern education future for his last son, just like his brother.

Habib Bourguiba grew up among women, as his brother was in Tunis and his father was elderly. He spent his days with his mother, grandmother and sister, Aïcha and Nejia, which permitted him to notice the casual household chores of women and their inequality with men. After starting his elementary education in Monastir, his father sent him to Tunis in September 1907, when he was 5, to pursue his studies at the Sadiki primary school. The young boy was profoundly affected by the separation from his mother at that early age. At the time of his arrival, the city was struggling against the protectorate, an early phase of the Tunisian national movement led by Ali Bach Hamba. Meanwhile, Habib settled in the wealthy neighbourhood of Tourbet el Bey in the medina of Tunis, where his brother, M&#x27;hamed, rented a lodging on Korchani Street. As the school year began, his brother enrolled him in Sadiki College where the superintendent described him as &quot;turbulent but studious&quot;.

The young Habib spent his vacations in Monastir, aiding others with chores. At the end of the holiday season, he returned to Tunis where, after classes, he used to wander around in the streets. On Thursdays, he watched the bey chair the weekly seals ceremony. The Jellaz demonstrations of 1911 and the resulting execution of Manoubi Djarjar that followed influenced his nascent political opinions. Bourguiba earned his &quot;certificat d&#x27;études primaires&quot; in 1913, which greatly satisfied his father. Bourguiba avoided military service, and, like his elders, was admitted as an internal in Sadiki College to pursue his secondary studies freely. His mother died in November 1913, when he was 10 years old.

=== Teenage years and secondary studies ===

When World War I started in September 1914, Bourguiba moved out from his brother&#x27;s house and settled in the dormitories of Sadiki College. Budgetary restrictions, enacted in order to support the war effort, contributed to malnutrition and inadequate supplies. These circumstances led students to protest, and Bourguiba soon came to participate. He admired Habib Jaouahdou, a student who told others about national struggles beyond the walls of high school. Jaouahdou proposed that they welcome Abdelaziz Thâalbi when he returned from exile, Bourguiba being part of the welcoming Sadiki delegation. In addition, the funerals of nationalist leader Bechir Sfar in Jellaz had also impacted him, as he travelled with his father. At school, one of his professors taught him the art of French writing and, indirectly, Arab literature. Despite that, his grades were low; Bourguiba did not pass his Arabic patent in 1917, which would have allowed him to get an administrative function. The headmaster permitted him to restart his sixth and final year of high school, in 1919–20. But the winter season and aforementioned malnutrition severely worsened his health, and he was hospitalized following his primary infection. Accordingly, he was obliged to abandon his studies and remain at the hospital.

In order to heal, Bourguiba spent nearly two years living with older brother Mohamed, medic at the local hospital of Kef who also happened to be a strong modernist and advocating secularism. Mohamed lived with an Italian nurse who welcomed young Habib properly and had an important part in his improvement, by &quot;filling in his emotional void&quot;, according to Souhayr Belhassen and Sophie Bessis. His journey in there, which lasted 21 months from January 1920, was a major turning point in his life. The inhabitants of the city helped him integrate: He learned how to play cards, discussed military strategies, got interested in Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and also visited his other brother, Ahmed, in Thala where he learned horse riding. He also participated in theatrical activities. Bourguiba rehearsed with his brother, who had a passion for theater and performed on stage. The foundation of the Destour party while he was in Kef, increased Bourguiba&#x27;s interest in Tunisian nationalism. He expressed his will to pursue his secondary studies and thus, study law in France, so he could struggle against the colonial power. The family council that was held to discuss this matter was a complete failure, his brothers considering him as &quot;unsuccessful&quot; and were not ready to finance his studies. Only his thirty years old single brother, Mahmoud, promised to aid him. With his support, Bourguiba was enrolled in Lycée Carnot of Tunis, in classe de seconde, because he was too weak to study in classe de première.

In high school, Bourguiba achieved high grades in Mathematics with the help of the new teacher that taught him. He obtained excellent results and ended up choosing Philosophy section, after passing the first part of baccalaureate. He also became friends with Tahar Sfar and Bahri Guiga. The group was called the &quot;Sahelian Trio&quot;. He often went to libraries and showed interest in history even though, sometimes, he skipped classes, mainly on Friday afternoons, to attend Habiba Msika&#x27;s performance of &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;. He was soon affected by the inequalities between French and Tunisians. In 1922, when Naceur Bey threatened to abdicate because of resident-general Lucien Saint&#x27;s maneuvers, public opinion decided to mobilize for this nationalist bey. On 22 April 1922, Bourguiba was part of the protesters to support the monarch. Influenced by that event, he used to participate in debates with his friends and got interested in political and philosophical learning, supporting socialism. In 1923–24, his final year was fundamental as he had a tight contest with another French classmate, in order to obtain a scholarship to study in Paris. He also benefited from the support of his brother Mahmoud, who promised to send him 50 francs per month. In 1924, he sat for his baccalaureate and obtained outstanding marks with honours. At the end of exams, Bourguiba embarked on an old boat, &quot;Le Oujda&quot;, in order to pursue his studies in France and discover the colonial power.

=== Higher education in Paris ===

When he arrived in Paris, Bourguiba settled in Saint-Séverin hotel, near Place Saint-Michel, where he occupied a room located on the sixth floor for 150 francs per month. Having had some hard times, his problems were resolved as he obtained a scholarship of 1800 francs, payable in two installments, and enrolled in Paris law School, in the Sorbonne to attend psychology and literature classes. Aware that he came to France to &quot;arm himself intellectually against France&quot;, he devoted himself to law and to the discovery of French civilization. Bourguiba often participated in political debates, read newspapers and followed closely the evolution of French politics during the Third Republic. Sensitive to the ideas of Leon Blum, following the Congress of Tours, he was opposed to the Bolsheviks and got interested in Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s process to transform the Indian national Congress into a powerful mass organization. In addition, he showed a great interest in his fellow Tunisian, Mahmoud El Materi.

After vacations spent between Mahdia and Monastir, Bourguiba returned to Paris for the start of the 1925–26 school year, worried about the nationalist struggle in his country. His conditions improved as he moved in the University Campus in Jourdan boulevard, where he lodged in room number 114. The sponsor, Taïeb Radhouane, sent him through the association &quot;Les Amis de l&#x27;étudiant&quot;, the registration fees to register for Paris Institute of Political Studies, where he started to attend public finance classes. He also obtained a financial aid from his friend and protector, Mounier-Pillet, who was his former teacher in Monastir. The same year, his friends Sfar and Guiga, joined him while he was tutoring a young Sfaxian boy, Mohamed Aloulou, sent by his parents to sit for the baccalaureate exam in Lycée Louis-le-Grand. One day in 1925, while tidying his room, Bourguiba found the address of a woman his protector recommended him to meet: Mathilde Lefras, a 35 years old widow whose husband died during the war. He met her for the first time in her apartment, on the first floor of a building in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. She invited him to enter and asked him to tell his story. Touched by his background, she asked to see him once again, and, in the upcoming months, invited him to move in with her. Since then, he gave away his room in the campus and settled with Mathilde. With this new way of life, Bourguiba distanced himself from the other students but also the Tunisian struggle, as a strong repression started back at the country.

During the summer of 1926, Bourguiba returned to Monastir but did not show any interest in political issues in his country. His father died in September and he received a telegram from Mathilde, announcing that she was pregnant. This situation and the parenting responsibility that lay ahead, worried him. Thus, he decided to raise the child, despite his friend&#x27;s advice to abandon the baby and break up with Mathilde. This pregnancy reassured him as he thought he was sterile. But the relationship of the couple worsened to a point that Bourguiba left the house to sleep at his friends&#x27; place, back at the campus. On 9 April 1927, Mathilde gave birth to a boy, whom they named Jean Habib. They moved into another apartment in Bagneux, in the Parisian suburbs. Bourguiba, sick at the time, had to prepare for his final exams, which he sat for a month after the birth of his son. He obtained respectively a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law and the higher degree of political studies from the Paris Institute of Political Studies.

=== Early adult life and professional career ===

In August 1927, Bourguiba returned to Tunisia with his girlfriend, son, Habib Jr., and also a deep knowledge of French politics during the Third Republic. His journey in France had influenced his thinking with the liberal values of the social-radical secular country, shared earlier by his brother Mohamed. Following his return to Tunisia, he married Mathilde, with Mahmoud Laribi as his best man, and settled in Tunis. At the time, he was not interested in politics but in his professional career, every debuting lawyer having to do a three-year traineeship under the supervision of another experienced lawyer. From October 1927 to October 1928, he worked for Mr. Cirier, who dismissed him after six weeks, then for Mr. Pietra and Scemama, who did not pay him for two months and charged him with writing responsibilities. Bourguiba then resigned to work for Mr. Salah Farhat, chairman of the Destour party, until Mr. Sebault hired him for 600 francs per month, which led Bourguiba to work for him for an additional year to the three mandatory ones.

In the context of colonial oppression, Bourguiba felt the effects of inequality. He spent the next year unemployed. This inequality led him to discuss these matters with both Tunisian and French friends, who agreed with the necessity to start a reform process aiming to get Tunisia to resemble France, that was, liberal, modern and secular. On 8 January 1929, while replacing his brother who could not attend a conference held by Habiba Menchari, an unveiled woman who advocated gender equality, Bourguiba defended Tunisian identity, culture and religion by opposing Menchari&#x27;s position to rid women of their veils. Bourguiba responded saying that Tunisia was threatened by the forfeiture of its personality and that it had to be preserved until the country was emancipated. This statement surprised liberals like the French unionist Joachim Durel. The controversy that followed opposed him to Bourguiba for nearly a month, Bourguiba writing in &quot;L&#x27;Étendard tunisien&quot; while Durel responded in &quot;Tunis socialiste&quot;.

The year 1930 was the peak of French colonization in North Africa, which led France to celebrate the centenary of the French conquest of Algeria, by organizing a eucharistic congress in Tunisia. On this occasion, millions of Europeans invaded the capital city and went to the Saint-Lucien de Carthage Cathedral disguised as crusaders which humiliated and revolted the people who protested against what they considered a violation of an Islamic land by Christians. The protesters, strongly repressed, were brought to justice. Some of them had Bourguiba as their lawyer, since he had not participated in the event. He also remained neutral when Tahar Haddad was dismissed from his notary duties. He estimated at that moment, that the main goals were political, while other problems of society were secondary. He insisted that Tunisian identity had to be affirmed, declaring: &quot;Let us be what we are before becoming what we will&quot;.

== 1930–1934: Early political career ==

In the beginning of the 1930s, Habib Bourguiba, feeling the effects of colonial inequalities, decided to join the main political party of the Tunisian national movement, the Destour, alongside his brother M&#x27;hamed and his mates Bahri Guiga, Tahar Sfar and Mahmoud El Materi. Revolted by the festivities of the 30th eucharistic congress, held from 7 to 11 May 1930 in Carthage, and which he considered as a &quot;violation of islamic lands&quot;, the young nationalists found it necessary to get involved. With the upcoming preparations for the 50th anniversary celebration of the protectorate and the scheduled visit of French president Paul Doumer, the young nationalists decided to act. Bourguiba denounced the rejoicing, in the newspaper &quot;Le Croissant&quot;, ran by his cousin Abdelaziz El Aroui, as a &quot;humiliating affront to the dignity of the Tunisian people to whom he recalls the loss of freedom and independence&quot;. Therefore, the leaders of the Destour party gathered in emergency at Orient Hotel, in February 1931, where it was decided to found an endorsing committee to the newspaper of Chedly Khairallah, &quot;La Voix du Tunisien&quot;, which switched from weekly to daily and had among its editors the young nationalist team.

Bourguiba multiplied his denunciations of the attempts aiming the Tunisian personality but also the beylical decree system and Europeans&#x27; advantages in his numerous articles in &quot;L&#x27;Étendard tunisien&quot; and &quot;La Voix du Tunisien&quot;, claiming Tunisian access to all administrative positions. Soon, he described his own definition of the protectorate, challenging its existence, not just its effects like the elder nationalists did, by writing on 23 February 1931 that &quot;for a healthy strong nation that international competitions and a momentary crisis forced into accepting the tutelage of a stronger state, the contact of a more advanced civilization determines in it a salutary reaction. A true regeneration occurs in it and, through judicious assimilation of the principles and methods of this civilization, it inevitably come to realize in stages its final emancipation&quot;.

Thanks to the originality with which Bourguiba, Sfar, Guiga and El Materi addressed the problems, &quot;La Voix du Tunisien&quot; became a very popular newspaper. Their new reasoning attracted not only the interest of public opinion but also that of French &quot;preponderants&quot;, powerful businesspersons and great land owners, who had a strong influence on the colonial administration. Opposed to the daring work of the young team, they achieved the censorship of all nationalist papers through the Residence (the colonial government) on 12 May 1931. A few days later, Habib and M&#x27;hamed Bourguiba, Bahri Guiga, Salah Farhat and El Materi were all prosecuted. However, they succeeded in obtaining the adjournment of their trial until 9 June 1931. On that day, numerous people came to show their support to the charged team getting their trial to be postponed once again. In response to this decision, Resident-general François Manceron, eager to put an end to the nationalist issue, achieved to outwit discord between Khairallah, the owner of the paper and the young nationalists. A conflict occurred between both parties about the management of &quot;La Voix du Tunisien&quot; which led to the team eager to take charge of the paper. However, because of the refusal of Khairallah, they decided to resign from the daily paper.

Despite the split-up, the two Bourguibas, El Materi, Guiga and Bahri kept in touch and decided to found their own paper thanks to the aid of pharmacist Ali Bouhajeb. Therefore, on 1 November 1932, was published the first edition of &quot;L&#x27;Action Tunisienne&quot; which had as redactional committee the young team joined by Bouhageb and Béchir M&#x27;hedhbi. Thus, Bourguiba devoted his first article to budget. Soon disappointed by the resigned moderation of their elders, the young nationalists unleashed and took the defence of the lower classes. Bourguiba, who saw his popularity increase thanks to his writings, frequented often intellectual circles whom he had just met. He showed both clarity and accuracy in his writings, which revealed a talented polemicist, thanks to his strong legal expertise. Furthermore, he had worked on demonstrating the colonial exploitation mechanism by ascending from effects to causes, while showing a great interest in social phenomenons, inviting the workers and students to organize and thus, defend themselves better against exploitation. In addition, he encouraged the defense and safeguard of the Tunisian personality.

With the economic crisis deepening and the resigned moderation of the nationalists, Bourguiba and his fellow mates reckoned that a good cause would be necessary enough to rebuild the nationalist movement on new basis by choosing new methods of action. In February 1933, when M&#x27;hamed Chenik, banker and chairman of the Tunisian credit union, got into trouble with the Residence, Bourguiba is the only one to defend him., reckoning that this issue could permit him to rally the bourgeois class, considered as collaborator with France, and unify the country around nationalism. Nevertheless, it only ended up with the resignation of Guiga, M&#x27;hedhi and Bouhajeb. Thus, Bourguiba abandoned his lawyer work to concentrate on running the journal by his own. But the occasion to express himself soon turned up: The Tunisian naturalization issue, which was a popular case among the nationalists during the 1920s reappeared, in the start of 1933, with protests in Bizerte against the burial of a naturalized in a Muslim cemetery. Bourguiba decided to react and unleash a campaign to support the protests in &quot;L&#x27;Action Tunisienne&quot; which will soon be reprised by numerous nationalist newspapers, denouncing an attempt to Frenchify the &quot;whole Tunisian people&quot;.

The firm stance of Bourguiba led him to acquire a strong popularity among the nationalist circles. Furthermore, the congress held by the Destour which took place on 12 and 13 May 1933 in Tunis, ended in favor of the young team of &quot;L&#x27;Action tunisienne&quot;, elected unanimously in the executive party committee. This strong position among the movement permitted them to influence party decision, eager to unify all the factions among a nationalist front. In the meantime, due to the ongoing naturalist issue in Tunis, the Residence decided the suspension of every nationalist paper on 31 May, including &quot;L&#x27;Action Tunisienne&quot; but also the prohibition of Destour activity. However, the French government convinced that Manceron had acted tardily in taking expected measures, replaced him by Marcel Peyrouton on 29 July 1933. Bourguiba deprived of his freedom of speech in this repression atmosphere and trapped inside the Destour moderate policy, aspired to get his autonomy back.

On 8 August, the occasion to express his views arrived when incidents began in Monastir following the burial of a naturalized child by force in a Muslim graveyard. Soon, law enforcement and population started a fight, which led Bourguiba to convince certain Monastirians to choose him as their lawyer. Furthermore, he led them to protest to the bey, on 4 September. The party leadership seeing this as an occasion to get rid of a new form of activism they dislike, decided to reprimand the young nationalist. Bourguiba, who considered the Destour and its leaders as an obstacle to his ambitions, decided to resign from the party on 9 September. Soon enough, he had learned from this experience. This success obtained by popular violent uprising showed the failure of the Destour&#x27;s methods, consisting mainly of petitions. Only violence of determined groups could lead the Residence to step back and negotiate the solutions; this was his course of action until 1956.

== 1934–1939: Rising nationalist leader ==

=== Founding of Neo-Destour and colonial repression ===


After he resigned from the executive committee of Destour, Bourguiba was on his own once again. However, his fellow mates of &quot;L&#x27;Action Tunisienne&quot; soon were in conflict with the elders of the party, ending with the exclusion of Guiga, on 17 November 1933 and the resignation of El Materi, M&#x27;hamed Bourguiba and Sfar from the executive committee on 7 December 1933. Soon referred to as &quot;rebels&quot;, they were joined by Bourguiba and decided to undertake a campaign all over the country and explain their political positions to the people. Meanwhile, the elders of the Destour unleashed a propaganda campaign aiming to discredit them. Therefore, the young team visited areas severely affected by the economic crisis, including Ksar Hellal and Moknine where they were reluctantly welcomed. Thanks to Ahmed Ayed, a wealthy and respected Ksar Hellal inhabitant, the occasion to explain themselves was given. On 3 January 1934, they gathered with a part of the Ksar Hellal population in his house to clarify the reasons of their conflict with the Destour and specify their conception of national struggle for emancipation.

The speeches and determination to act of this new generation of nationalist was greatly welcomed by the Tunisian population which did not hesitate to criticize the &quot;neglect of the Destour leadership to defend their interests&quot;. Upon the refusal of the executive committee to organize a special congress aiming to change their political orientations and thanks to the support of the population and notables, the &quot;secessionists&quot; decided to hold their own congress in Ksar Hellal on 2 March 1934. During the event, Bourguiba called the representatives to &quot;choose the men who shall defend in their name the liberation of the country&quot;. The congress ended with the founding of a new political party, the Neo-Destour, presided by El Materi, and Bourguiba was designated chairman.

After the party was founded, the Neo-Destour aimed to strengthen its position among the political movements. The young team faced the resident-general, Marcel Peyrouton, who was dedicated to stopping the nationalist protests in an economic crisis atmosphere, which was an opportunity to seduce a larger audience. Thus, they needed to earn a greater place on the political stage, spread their ideology and rally the supporters of a still-strong Destour, and also convince the lower classes that the Neo-Destour was their advocate. The Neo-Destour invited the lower classes to join in &quot;a dignity tormented by half a century of protectorate&quot;. Therefore, Bourguiba traveled all around the country and used new methods of communication different from that of the Destour elders. The lower classes, alienated and troubled by economic crisis, were convinced by his speech and joined his cause, bringing their full support to it. Units were created all over the country and a new structure was settled, making the Neo-Destour a more efficient movement than all those before. If the elders addressed the colonial oppressor to express their requests, the &quot;secessionists&quot; addressed the people. Even worldwide, the new party succeeded in finding support among French socialists, including philosopher and politician Félicien Challaye, who endorsed the Neo-Destour.

However, in Tunisia, the Neo-Destour had to face the strong opposition of resident-general Peyrouton who, firstly, endorsed the initiative of the &quot;secessionists&quot;, eyeing it as a mean to weaken the nationalist movement, but soon withdrew his support because of the new successful methods adopted by the young team and their unexpected requests. Indeed, Bourguiba and his fellows from the newly created-party soon showed &quot;more dangerous&quot; demands by asking for national sovereignty and the ascending of an independent Tunisia &quot;accompanied by a treaty guaranteeing France a preponderance both in the political as well as in the economic field compared to other foreign countries&quot;, in an article published in &quot;L&#x27;Action Tunisienne&quot;.

All these demands led to a conflict between the French government and the Tunisian nationalist movement. In addition, the party leadership secured the population to be sensitive to their message, thanks to their tours along the country. These tensions led the residence to answer the nationalist requests by serious measures of intimidation. The repression unleashed is furthermore violent: Peyrouton forbade all the newspapers still publishing including &quot;Tunis socialiste&quot; but also &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; and &quot;Le Populaire&quot;, on 1 September 1934. On 3 September, the colonial government ordered raids against all nationalist leaders in the country, including both Destours and the Tunisian Communist Party. Bourguiba was arrested and then sent to Kebili, in the south, under military supervision. Meanwhile, the arrests of the mean leaders generated discontent among the population. While Guiga and Sfar tried to pacify them in order to negotiate the release of the imprisoned, Bourguiba and Salah Ben Youssef were for the retention of the unrest. Furthermore, riots occurred along the country, leading the residence to reinforce the repression. Soon, the South gathered a major part of Tunisian political leaders: The two Bourguibas in Tataouine, El Materi in Ben Gardane, Guiga in Médenine and Sfar in Zarzis.

On 3 April 1935, all the deported were transferred to Bordj le Boeuf. Although glad to be all together, they were soon in conflict upon the strategy the party had to choose. While the majority were part of the decay of the uprising and the dismissal of the methods adopted in 1934, Bourguiba was opposed to any concession. Soon he was accused by his fellow detainees to &quot;lead them to their loss&quot;; Only Ben Youssef was not against Bourguiba&#x27;s methods since 1934 but reckoned they needed to be free again at all cost and therefore, attempt to save what can still be. However, the conflict receded due to the hard conditions of detention aiming to coax them.

=== From negotiation attempt to confrontation ===

In the start of 1936, due to the ineffective policy of Peyrouton, the French government proceeded to his replacement with Armand Guillon, designated in March whose mission is to reinstate peace. Therefore, he succeeded in putting an end to two years of colonial repression, promoting dialogue and freeing the nationalist detainees on 23 April. Thus, Bourguiba was sent to Djerba where he was visited by the newly settled resident-general who was ready to negotiate with him, aiming to put an end to the conflicts and pursue a new liberal and humane policy. On 22 May, Bourguiba was freed of all charges and had the permission to regain his home in Tunis, alongside his fellow detainees. Meanwhile, in France, the Popular Front ascended with the settlement of Leon Blum&#x27;s cabinet in June. This was a great opportunity for the leaders, who had always been close to the socialists. Soon, they met Guillon who promised to restore restricted liberties. Very satisfied by their interview with Guillon, the leaders were convinced that the ascending of the Blum ministry and the arrival of Guillon as head of the colonial government would be the start of flourishing negotiations which would lead to independence, even though they did not state it publicly.

On 10 June, the National Council of Neo-Destour gathered to establish a new policy towards this change in the French government. It ended with the endorsement of the new French policy and elaboration upon a series of feasible requests, to which the Neo-Destour expected a quick resolution. At the end of the meeting, Bourguiba was sent to Paris to set forth the platform of the party. In France, he became close to such Tunisian nationalist students as Habib Thameur, Hédi Nouira and Slimane Ben Slimane. Furthermore, he met under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, Pierre Viénot, on 6 July 1936. This publicly stated interview was unpopular among the French colonialists in Tunisia, which led later meetings to be conducted secretly. But French authorities were opposed to the hopes of Tunisian militants, and some of them even thought that it was a mere illusion. When he returned to Tunis, in September, the political atmosphere had changed with the re-establishment of liberties, which permitted the expansion of Neo-Destour and an increase in its members.

The resident-general in Tunisia introduced assimilation reforms by the end of 1936. This statement is the start of uprisings by the beginning of 1937. Viénot, travelling to Tunisia, reacted by declaring that &quot;certain private interests of the French of Tunisia do not necessarily confound with those of France&quot;. Meanwhile, Bourguiba went to Paris, and then to Switzerland to attend a lecture about the capitulation held in April in Montreux. There, he met numerous Arab nationalist representatives including Chekib Arslan, Algerian Messali Hadj and Egyptian Nahas Pasha.

In June, the resigning Blum Cabinet was replaced by the third Chautemps Cabinet, led by Camille Chautemps. Due to the procrastination of the new cabinet, the nationalists resumed to their fight and were active in making their requests a reality. Therefore, Bourguiba wished that Abdelaziz Thâalbi, founder of the Destour who had just returned from exile, endorsed the Neo-Destour to strengthen its positions. But his wish was not fulfilled for the elder leader had other prospects about the party, desiring to unify the old Destour with the new. Due to his refusal, Bourguiba decided to react by sabotaging Thaalbi&#x27;s meetings. In Mateur, the fight ended with numerous deaths and injured but Bourguiba succeeded in strengthening his positions and appearing as the unique leader of the nationalist movement, rejecting, once and for all Pan-Arabism and anti-occidentalism. The split up was, therefore, final between both parties. Fearing attacks, the Destourian party gave up public meetings, using newspapers to respond their opponents.

However, Bourguiba chose moderation regarding the relation with France. Meanwhile, within the party, two factions appeared: The first one, moderate, was led by El Materi, Guiga and Sfar, favoring dialogue while the second one, radical, was directed by the young members, including Nouira, Ben Slimane and Thameur, who were supporters of confrontation. At the time, Bourguiba was hesitant to choose between the two factions because he needed the support of the youth to gain domination upon the Neo-Destour, the leadership still being among the founding moderate members. Nevertheless, he soothed the tensions of the young, estimating that a confrontation with France would only have bad consequences and that the dialogue can still be favored. In the start of October, he flew to Paris, aiming to pursue negotiations, but returned without any result. Thus, he realized there was nothing to be awaited from France.

In this conjecture, was held the second congress of Neo-Destour in Tribunal Street, Tunis, on 29 October 1937. The voting of a motion regarding the relations with France was in the agenda. The congress represented the fight of the two factions which appeared within the last months. In his speech, Bourguiba tried to balance both trends. Upon reducing the influence of the Destour over the nationalist movement, he strongly defended the progressive emancipation policy which he had advocated:

The congress, which finished on 2 November, ended by withdrawing its support to the French government and therefore, the confidence the party had granted it for nearly two years. Bourguiba, who helped numerous young people join the leadership, strengthened his position and authority among the Neo-Destour and ended up victorious.

While the party twitched and the newly restored repression had ended with seven death in Bizerte, Bourguiba chose confrontation. On 8 April 1938, an organized demonstration happened peacefully but Bourguiba, convinced that violence was necessary, urged Materi to repeat the demonstrations by saying, &quot;Since there was no blood, we need to repeat. There must be blood spilled for them to speak of us&quot;. His wish was satisfied the following morning. The riots of 9 April 1938 ended with one dead policemen, 22 protestors and more than 150 injured. The following day, Bourguiba and his mates were arrested and detained at the Civilian Prison of Tunis, where Bourguiba was interrogated. On 12 April, the Neo-Destour was dissolved, but its activism was pursued in secret. On 10 June 1939, Bourguiba and his companions were charged with conspiracy against public order and state security and incitement of civil war. Therefore, he was transferred to the penitentiary of Téboursouk.

== 1939–1945: World War II ==

At the outbreak of World War II, Bourguiba was transferred on board of a destroyer, into the fort of Saint-Nicolas in Marseille on 26 May 1940. There he shared his cell with Hédi Nouira. Convinced that the war would end with the victory of the Allies, he wrote a letter to Habib Thameur, on 10 August 1942, to define his positions: 

He was transferred to Lyon and imprisoned in Montluc prison on 18 November 1942 then in Fort de Vancia until Klaus Barbie decided to free him and take him to Chalon-sur-Saône. He was greatly welcomed in Rome, alongside Ben Youssef and Ben Slimane, in January 1943, upon the request of Benito Mussolini who hoped to use Bourguiba to weaken the French resistance in North Africa. The Italian minister for foreign affairs tried to obtain from him a declaration in their favor. At his return&#x27;s eve, he accepted to deliver a message to the Tunisian people, via Radio Bari, warning them against all the trends. When he returned to Tunis, on 8 April 1943, he guaranteed that his 1942 message was transmitted to all the population and its activists. With his position, he stood out from the collaboration of certain activists with the German occupant, settled in Tunisia in November 1942 and escaped the fate of Moncef Bey, dethroned with the liberation, in May 1943, by general Alphonse Juin, accusing him of collaboration. Bourguiba was freed by the Free French Force on 23 June.

In this period, he met Wassila Ben Ammar, his future second wife. Bourguiba, who was closely watched, did not feel like resuming the fight. Therefore, he requested the authorization to perform the pilgrimage of Mecca. This surprising request was refused by the French authorities. He then decided to flee in Egypt and in order to do that, crossed the Libyan borders, disguised in a caravan, on 23 March 1945 and arrived in Cairo in April.

== 1945–1949: Journey in Middle East ==

Bourguiba settled in Cairo, Egypt where he was aided by his former monasterial teacher, Mounier-Pillet, who lived in the Egyptian Capital city. There, Bourguiba met numerous personalities, such as Taha Hussein while participating in many events held in the city. He also met Syrians, who had just obtained their independence from France, and thus stated that &quot;with the means they dispose, Arab countries should show solidarity with the national liberation struggles of the Maghreb&quot;. Even though his efforts were intensified, Bourguiba knew that nobody would support his cause as long as there was little tension between France and Tunisia. The Arab League was preoccupied mainly by the Palestinian issue, other requests not being their top priority. Therefore, he charged Ben Youssef to start these Franco-Tunisian tensions so that he could attract the attention of the Middle East.

Bourguiba pursued his efforts. Furthermore, he met Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud and tried to sensitize him to support the Tunisian nationalist struggle, but in vain. Due to the postponed promises of the people of Middle-East, Bourguiba decided to create an office of Neo-Destour in Cairo. Therefore, he invited Thameur, Rachid Driss, Taïeb Slim, Hédi Saïdi and Hassine Triki, detained by France and freed by Germans during the war, to join him in the Egyptian Capital. They arrived on 9 June 1946, aiding Bourguiba to start the rallying point of the North African community in Cairo. Soon, they were joined by Algerian and Moroccan nationalists. Furthermore, Bourguiba&#x27;s speech was famous among the Anglo-Saxon media, and Maghrebi nationalism became more efficient in Cairo. Bourguiba was more and more convinced that the key to the nationalist struggle resided within the United States whose interests were same as those of the Maghrebi nationalists. Thus, he was looking forward to go to the states and benefited from the support of Hooker Doolittle, American consul in Alexandria. Firstly, he went to Switzerland, then Belgium, and covertly passed the borders to get to Antwerp, abroad the &quot;Liberty ship&quot;, on 18 November. On 2 December 1946, Bourguiba arrived in New York City while the session of the General Assembly of the United Nations opened.

There, Bourguiba took part in numerous receptions and banquets which was for him an occasion to meet American politicians, such as Dean Acheson, under-secretary of State, whom he meets in January 1947. Upon his trip to the United States, Bourguiba concluded that the superpower would support Tunisia in case its case was submitted to the United Nations. He based this idea on the United Nations Charter, signed by France and which stipulated the right of nation to self-determination. Therefore, he met Washington, D.C. officials and gained the attention of American public opinion thanks to the help of Lebanese Cecil Hourana, director of the Arab office of information in New York. Bourguiba, then, was strongly convinced he could bring up the Tunisian case in the international with the help of the five Arab states members of the United Nations.

Meanwhile, in Cairo, the Arab League resigned to inscribe the North African case is its agenda. Furthermore, a congress held by the nationalists of Cairo, from 15 to 22 February 1947 about the case of North Africa, ended with the creation of a Maghrebi office, replacing the representation of Neo-Destour. Its essential goals were to reinforce resistance movements inside colonized countries but also abroad, aiming to get the United Nations involved. Habib Thameur was designated as head of this organisation. In March 1947, Bourguiba came back to Cairo and, for nearly a year, tried to convince Arab leaders to introduce the Tunisian Case to the UN. In addition, he endowed Neo-Destour of its second representation in the Arab World, in Damascus, led by Youssef Rouissi, who knew the Syrians well. Nevertheless, progress were slow and Bourguiba&#x27;s journey in Middle-East ended only with a substantial material assistance on behalf of Saudi Arabia, neither Iraq nor Syria nor Libya wanting to support his cause.

Upon the disinterest of the members of Arab League for Maghrebi struggle, while the war in Palestine was the center of all attention and efforts, the union of different nationalist movements seemed to be the better way to get their requests heard. But soon, divisions appeared among Tunisians, Moroccan and Algerians, preventing common agreements. On 31 May 1947, the arrival of Abdelkrim al-Khattabi from exile revived the movement. Under his impulse, the committee of liberation of North Africa was founded on 5 January 1948. The values of the committee were Islam, Pan-arabism and total independence of Maghreb with the refusal of any concessions with the colonizer. Headed by Khattabi, designated president for life, Bourguiba was secretary-general. However, despite the status of the Moroccan leader, the committee was not as successful as the Office of Arab Maghreb. Obsessed by the Palestinian issue, the leaders of the Arab League were refusing to support the Maghrebi issue, whose problems deepened with a financial crisis.

While Khattabi favored an armed struggle, Bourguiba was strongly opposed, defending the autonomy of the Tunisian nationalism, which soon divided the Maghrebi committee. His moderate ideas made him infamous among the other members of the committee, whose numbers were increasing day after day. To discredit Bourguiba, rumors were spread that he received, underhand, funding from many Arab leaders and that he had special relationships with the French embassy in Egypt. During his trip to Libya, in spring 1948, the committee removed him from his duties of secretary-general. Noting that there were too much ideological differences between the Committee and himself, it only contributed in discrediting his relationship with Cairo Tunisians such as Thameur, with whom his relationship was deteriorating.

Even in Tunis, his exile in Middle-East, weakened the Tunisian leader: Apart from the ascending of Moncefism, after the removal and exile of Moncef Bey in Pau, the party restructured around Ben Youssef with the help of the newly created Tunisian General Labour Union by Farhat Hached. Even though elected president of the party, during the Congress of Dar Slim, held clandestinely in Tunis in October 1948, he was now assisted by three vice-presidents whose goal was to limit the power of the president: Hedi Chaker in Tunis, Youssef Rouissi in Damascus and Habib Thameur in Cairo. Having gone to the Egyptian capital to support the national struggle abroad, Bourguiba found himself, four years later, weakened politically and marginalized among the Maghrebi Committee in Cairo, exiled and isolated from Tunisia. Aware of the importance of the struggle inside the country, he decided to regain Tunis on 8 September 1949.

== 1949–1956: Fighting for independence ==

=== Failure of negotiations with France ===

When he returned to Tunisia, Bourguiba decided to start a campaign to regain control of the party. From November 1949 to March 1950, Bourguiba visited cities such as Bizerte, Medjez el-Bab and Sfax and saw his popularity increase, thanks to his charisma and oratory skills. Once he had achieved his goals, he reappeared as the leader of the nationalist movement and therefore, decided to travel to France, ready for negotiations. On 12 April 1950, he landed in Paris to raise the Tunisian issue by mobilizing public opinion, media and politicians. Three days later, he gave a conference in Hôtel Lutetia to introduce the main nationalist requests, which he defined in seven points, stating that &quot;these reforms destined to lead us towards independence must reinforce and strengthen the spirit of cooperation [...] We believe that we are a country too weak militarily and too strong strategically to dispense with the help of a great power, which we would want to be France&quot;.

His speech quickly attracted the opposition of both the &quot;Preponderants&quot; and the pan-Arab circles who were strongly against his stepwise policy and his collaboration with France. Therefore, Bourguiba felt that an endorsement from the bey was not only necessary, but vital. Thereby, he sent Ben Youssef and Hamadi Badra, convince Muhammad VIII al-Amin bey to write a letter to Vincent Auriol. On 11 April 1950, the letter was written, reminding the French president of the Tunisian requests sent ten months ago and asking for &quot;necessary substantial reforms&quot;. At last, the French government reacted, on 10 June, with the designation of Louis Perillier as resident-general, who, according to then-minister for foreign affairs, Robert Schuman, &quot;shall aim to lead Tunisia towards the full development of its wealth and lead it towards independence, which is the end goal for all territories within the French Union&quot;. However, the word &quot;independence&quot; is soon replaced by &quot;internal autonomy&quot;. Despite that, Bourguiba was eager to support Périllier&#x27;s reform process. Soon, he was satisfacted with his flourishing results of his visit to Paris because the Tunisian case became one of the most debated issues by both public opinion and parliament.

In Tunis, Périllier, endorsed by Bourguiba, favoured the constitution of a new Tunisian cabinet, led by M&#x27;hamed Chenik with neo-destourian participation to mark the liberal turning decided by France. On 17 August 1950, the cabinet was invested counting among its members three ministers from Neo-Destour. However, the French Rally of Tunisia, opposed to any reform, succeeded to pressure both the colonial government in Tunisia and the French authorities in France, to get the negotiations restrained. Périllier ended up yield to pressure and stated on 7 October that &quot;It is time to give a break to reforms&quot;, which did not please the Tunisian government. Reacting to the statement, riots started in Enfida and ended with several dead and injured. Even though Bourguiba tried to pacify the atmosphere of tension, his strategy of collaboration with France was contested by the majority of Tunisian leaders who considered it indefensible, mainly after the adoption of deceiving reforms, on 8 February 1951.

Upon the blocking of negotiations with France, Bourguiba was convinced that there was nothing to do and decided to travel around the world, aiming to gain support for the Tunisian struggle. From 1950, even though he continued to negotiate with France, Bourguiba was considering the use of arms and violence to get things done. Therefore, he asked for the help of Ahmed Tlili to create a national resistance committee, with ten regional leaders responsible for the formation of armed groups and arms depot. During his visit to Pakistan, he did not exclude the use of popular mobilization to obtain independence. If he was introducing himself as an exiled militant back in his journey to Middle-East, he was now a leader of a major party among the Tunisian government. This new status permitted him to meet officials of all the countries he had visited: He met with Indian Prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru in New Delhi and the Indonesian president Sukarno. During his interviews, he urged his interlocuters to introduce the Tunisian issue to the United Nations, recalling his failed attempt to introduce it back in the September 1951 session.

Since his last meeting with Ahmed Ben Bella, in January 1950, Bourguiba was more and more convinced that an armed struggle was inevitable. Thus, in Cairo, he charged a group of people called &quot;Les Onze Noirs&quot; to train people, fundraise and gather weapons. Disappointed in the support promise of Egyptian and Saudi authorities, Bourguiba traveled to Milan, where the congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions opened in July 1951. Thanks to Farhat Hached, Bourguiba obtained an invitation to take part in the event. There, he was invited by American unionists of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) to their gathering, which took place in San Francisco in September 1951. Between July and September, he travelled to London then Stockholm. His journey in the United States ended in mid-October before he flew to Spain, Morocco, Rome and Turkey. There, he admired the work of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in building a secular modern state. He then wrote to his son: &quot;I have put a lot of thought into it. We can get to the same results, even better by less drastic means, which reflect more widely the soul of the people&quot;.

While Bourguiba proceeded with his world tour, the situation in Tunisia worsened: The promised reforms were blocked and the negotiations continued in Paris. On 31 October, as prime minister acting in the name of the bey, Chenik delivered officially to Schuman a memorandum summarizing the essential Tunisian requests regarding the intern autonomy. On 15 December, Bourguiba landed in Paris where he heard the answer of Schuman: The statement of 15 December, affirmed the principle of co-sovereignty and the &quot;final nature of the bond that links Tunisia to France&quot;. As for Bourguiba, it was then sure that endless and resultless negotiations were over. He stated to the AFP that &quot;A page of Tunisian history is turned. Schuman&#x27;s response opens a repression and resistance era, with its inevitable procession of mourning, tears and resentment [...] Exasperated, disappointed, out of patience, the Tunisian people will show the entire world that they are mature enough for freedom&quot;. Finally, he addressed the United States saying that &quot;Their freedom [the Tunisian people] is a necessary condition for the defense of the free world in the Mediterranean sea and everywhere else to secure peace&quot;.

=== Armed struggle ===

While the Tunisian delegation got back to Tunis upon the blocking of negotiations, Bourguiba remained in Paris where he judged essential to make contacts in this confrontation era. His goals consisted in obtaining funds and arms for the armed struggle but also convince the rest of the world to introduce the Tunisian issue in the United Nations. However, due to the refusal of his request by numerous diplomats, he decided to provoke the complaint and force the fight. Upon his return to Tunisia, on 2 January 1952, he hurried to meet the bey and Grand Vizier Chenik, who he urged to introduce the request to the United Nations Security Council, faking that he obtained the support of the American delegate if Tunisia complained. If they were hesitating at first, they soon gave way to Bourguiba. Meanwhile, the nationalist leader travelled all around the country to inform the people of this issue. His speeches became more and more violent and ended with his statement in Bizerte, on 13 January, where he denounced the cabinet if a delegation did not fly immediately to the U.N. The request was signed on 11 January in Chenik&#x27;s house by all the ministers of the cabinet, in the presence of Bourguiba, Hached and Tahar Ben Ammar. On 13 January, Salah Ben Youssef and Hamadi Badra flew to Paris, where they intended to desposit the complaint.

France did not appreciate the move and reacted with the nomination of Jean de Hauteclocque as new resident-general. Known for his radical hard way, he decided to prohibit the congress of Neo-Destour that should have been held on 18 January and proceeded with the arrest of activists, such as Bourguiba. The congress, which was held clandestinely, favored the continuation of the popular unrest. The following repression soon started a greater unrest. Meanwhile, Bourguiba was transferred to Tabarka where he kept a surprising flexibility and freedom of movement. He soon understood De Hautecloque&#x27;s maneuvers as his desire for Bourguiba to exile himself in nearby Algeria. He was even interviewed by &quot;Tunis Soir&quot; and was visited by Hédi Nouira and Farhat Hached.

Following the uprising in Tunisia, Afro-Asian country members of the UN finally answered the request of Ben Youssef and Badra, introducing the Tunisian case to the Security Council, on 4 February 1952. As for Bourguiba, &quot;it depends on France to make this appeal moot by loyally accepting the principle of internal autonomy of Tunisia&quot;. But on 26 March, upon the strong refusal of the bey to discharge Chenik&#x27;s cabinet, De Hauteclocque placed Chenik, El Materi, Mohamed Salah Mzali and Mohamed Ben Salem under house arrest in Kebili while Bourguiba was sent to Remada. A new cabinet, led by Slaheddine Baccouche took over.

Aiming to weaken the nationalist movement, De Hautecloque separated Bourguiba and his exile companions. Therefore, he was sent on the island of La Galite, on 21 May 1952. Settled in an old abandoned fort, he had health problems, caused by humidity and age. In France, the opponents to a Tunisian compromise discredited Bourguiba whom they accuse of preparing the armed struggle while negotiating with their government, in an article of &quot;Figaro&quot; published on 5 June. Meanwhile, the bey remained alone against the resident-general, resisting the pressures to approve reforms, judged &quot;minimal&quot; by the nationalists, which delighted Bourguiba. In the country, despite the unity of the people, De Hauteclocque pressured the adoption of reforms. Therefore, many assassinations took place: Farhat Hached is murdered on 5 December 1952 by La Main rouge. Bourguiba, deprived of posts and newspapers called for the intensification of the resistance.

In these conditions, the French government decided to replace De Hauteclocque with Pierre Voizard as resident-general, on 23 September 1953. Trying to appease the uprising, he lifted the curfew and newspaper censorship but also freed nationalist leaders. Furthermore, he replaced Baccouche with Mzali and promised new reforms which soon seduced the Tunisian people. Nevertheless, Bourguiba remained detained in La Galite Island with, however, a softening of imprisonment conditions. If the reforms legislated the principle of co-sovereignty, Bourguiba judged these measures to be outdated. But he was worried of the cleverness of Voizard, whose methods seemed to be more dangerous than the brutality of De Hauteclocque. This obvious liberalism seduced numerous Tunisians tired of this violence climate which had imposed itself for too long but divided the Neo-Destour between those who supported the policy of the new resident-general and those who didn&#x27;t. The differences among the party deepened more and more upon Voizard&#x27;s plans. Both Bourguiba and Ben Youssef remained strongly opposed to the collaboration between the bey and the residence. After a period of hesitation about what to do with the reform project, the Neo-Destour gave orders to resume actions of resistance. Therefore, the Fellaghas decided to resume the attacks in the countryside.

Voizard attempted to bring back peace by pardoning half the 900 Tunisian convicted on 15 May and decided to put an end to the two-year exile of Bourguiba in La Galite. On 20 May 1954, he was transferred to Groix Island but remained strongly firm on his positions, stating that &quot;the solution to the Tunisian problem was simple [...] The first step was to give Tunisia its internal autonomy, the economic, strategic, cultural rights of France in these fields being respected. Now, this a real confrontation&quot;. But these measures changed nothing: As the delegates of the French Rally of Tunisia requested in Paris that Bourguiba must be &quot;unable to resume a campaign of agitation&quot;, the Grand Vizier Mzali was almost killed in a failed assassination attempt. Despite the repression he instituted, Voizard lost control of the situation and faced the rage of certain Tunisians opposed to colonists. On 17 June, Mzali resigned from office without any successor left to take charge. This resignation did not leave an available interlocutor to negotiate with the newly invested cabinet of Pierre Mendès France on 18 June, six weeks after the defeat of French forces in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. The new head of government stated upon his designation that he will not &quot;tolerate any hesitation or reluctance in implementing the promises made to people who had confidence in France that had promised to put them in condition to manage their own affairs&quot;.

=== Internal autonomy agreements ===

On 21 July, Bourguiba was transferred into The Château de La Ferté in Amilly (110 kilometers from Paris) on the orders of Mendès France to preparing the upcoming negotiations. On 31 July, the new French prime minister travelled to Tunis and gave his famous speech in which he stated that the French government unilaterally recognizes the internal autonomy of Tunisia. Meanwhile, Bourguiba received representatives of Neo-Destour in Paris, under the supervision of the Direction centrale des renseignements généraux. In Tunis, a new cabinet led by Tahar Ben Ammar was formed to negotiate with the French authorities. Four members of Neo-Destour were made ministers.

On 18 August, the negotiations started. Bourguiba was given the right to settle in the hotel where the Tunisian delegation lodged. Thus, he received detailed reports of the delegation talks while he gave them instructions. However, the situation in the country worsened with the pursuing of the armed struggle. Likewise, the first day of negotiations started with a serious clash between military and rebels. Everybody was convinced that only a watchword from the Neo-Destour would convince the fellaghas to stop the fight. Nevertheless, the party was ripped between those who wanted the unrest to continue and those who wanted it to stop. Bourguiba wanted the fight to be over to hasten the negotiations for the internal autonomy. He had among the party numerous supporters of the stepwise policy of his. But many were those who wanted immediate independence. In this context, he appeared to be the only one to have the necessary authority to resolve the problem.

Mendès France, convinced that the current troubled situation threatened his colonial policy, was eager to meet Bourguiba. Therefore, he was transferred to Chantilly, in October, where he was from that moment lodged. The interview between both men remained secret and ended with Bourguiba&#x27;s promise to end the unrest in the country. Nevertheless, the beginning of the armed civil uprising in Algeria on 1 November 1954, did not improve the current situation. Indeed, the rage of French politicians, who accused the Tunisian fellaghas to collaborate with the Algerian rebels, slowed the negotiations. The situation worsened on 11 November, when the French government, addressed an ultimatum to the Tunisian government, announcing that the talks would stop until the unrest in Tunisia was over.

On 14 November, under the pressure of Bourguiba, the Nation Council of Neo-Destour, invited both French and Tunisian government to &quot;find a solution to the fellaghas issue guaranteeing in an explicit way their backup, their personal freedom and that of their families&quot;. On 20 November, an agreement was concluded. It said firstly that &quot;the Tunisian government solemnly invite the fellaghas to deliver their weapons to the French and Tunisian authorities&quot; and secondly that &quot;the resident-general of France and the Tunisian government vouch that under the agreement between them, the fellaghas shall not be disturbed or prosecuted and that measures be taken to facilitate their rehabilitation to normal life and that of their families&quot;. Furthermore, Bourguiba intervened a second time to reassure the resistance leaders of his confidence in Mendès France and reiterated his guarantee of their security. After two years of unrest, the discussions can finally resume.

Nevertheless, the negotiations for the internal autonomy were not unanimous: On 31 December 1954, while in Geneva, Ben Youssef, who wanted immediate independence, denounced the discussions and challenged the stepwise policy adopted by Bourguiba. Knowing that his statement would attract many favorable activists, mostly after the fall of the Mendès France cabinet on 6 February 1955, causing panic among the moderate faction of the party. Nevertheless, their fears were at ease with the arrival of Edgar Faure as head of the French government on 23 February. Faure assured his commitment to pursue the negotiations started by his predecessor. With Faure&#x27;s promise, it was necessary for the Neo-Destour to bring the two leaders closer and therefore, set forth a strong united nationalist front to France. However, Ben Youssef did not agree with the talks, denouncing any negotiation that would not lead immediately to the independence of the whole Maghrebi people, supported in his position by the Algerians.

On 21 April 1954, an interview between Faure and Bourguiba aimed to conclude the agreements for the internal autonomy. Hearing the news while participating in the Bandung Conference, Ben Youssef rejected the agreements which he judged contrary to the principle of internal autonomy and indicated to a journalist that he &quot;did not want to be Bourguiba&#x27;s subordinate anymore&quot;. As for him, the Tunisian people must be opposed to the conventions and demand immediate independence without any restrictions. Despite attempts to conciliate both leaders, the break between the two men was final. Bourguiba, however, tried to ease tensions and persuade Ben Youssef to get back to Tunisia, but in vain, the secretary-general of the party eager to remain in Cairo, until further notice.

On 1 June 1955, Bourguiba returned triumphant to Tunisia on board of the &quot;Ville d&#x27;Alger&quot; boat. Sailing from Marseille, he landed in La Goulette. On his own, he advanced to the bridge, waving his arm raising a large white tissue to greet the crowd. &quot;We were hundreds of millions coming to cheer him, interminably in a huge frenzy&quot;, testified his former minister Tahar Belkhodja. On 3 June, the internal autonomy conventions were signed by Ben Ammar and Faure, Mongi Slim and the French minister for Tunisian and Moroccan affairs, Pierre July.

After the ratification of the conventions, on 3 June, the consultations aiming to form the first cabinet of the internal autonomy started. However, Bourguiba was not to lead it. Beside the fact that it was too soon for France to have the &quot;Supreme Commander&quot; at the head of the Tunisian government, he stated that power did not attract him and judged it to be still early to hold an office within the state. Therefore, it was Tahar Ben Ammar who was chosen once again to lead the government. Likewise, the Neo-Destour prevails. It was the first time since 1881, that the Tunisian cabinet did not include a French member. While giving speeches all around the country, Bourguiba insisted on this fundamental fact, demonstrating that the conventions gave a large autonomy to the Tunisian people in management of its affairs. Defending his strategy, he must not leave the field open to the maximalism of Ben Youssef, supported by the Communists and the Destour.

=== Fratricidal struggles ===

On 13 September, Ben Youssef returned to the country from Cairo. Trying to bring back peace and convince Ben Youssef to reconsider his positions, Bourguiba went to the airport welcoming his &quot;old friend&quot;. But his efforts were in vain and peace was short: Ben Youssef did not wait too long to criticize the modernism of the &quot;supreme commander&quot; who trampled the Arab-Muslim values and invited Bourguiba&#x27;s opponents to resume the armed struggle to free the whole Maghreb. Reacting to Ben Youssef&#x27;s statements, the French High Commissioner judged them to be outre while the Neo-Destour Leadership impeached Ben Youssef of all his charges, during a meeting convened by Bourguiba. The exclusion was voted but the seriousness of the situation led them to keep the decision secret until further notice. It was finally made public on 13 October, surprising many activists who judged the decision to be too important to be taken by a mere meeting. Many factions, supportive of Ben Youssef, were opposed to the decision and declared Ben Youssef to be their rightful leader.

On 15 October, Ben Youssef reacted to the leadership&#x27;s decision in a meeting organized in Tunis: He declared the party leaders illegal and took the direction of a &quot;general Secretariat&quot; which he proclaimed being the only legitimate leadership of the Neo-Destour. The pan-Arab scholars of Ez-Zitouna, feeling marginalized by the occidental trend of the party, showed a great support for the conservative trend who had just being created. The country started to twitch once again. Ben Youssef multiplied his tours around the country facing the sabotage attempts of Bourguiba&#x27;s followers. However, cells supportive of Ben Youssef were creating everywhere, while many Neo-Destourian activists remained in an expectant hush, waiting to see who of the two leaders will have the last word. Therefore, Bourguiba started an information campaign which was successful, especially in Kairouan, who was seduced by the leader&#x27;s charisma and decided to rally his cause.

In this context, a congress was held in November 1955 to choose which of the two leaders would have the last word. Though Ben Youssef decided not to attend, Bourguiba ended up winner of the debate and obtained the endorsement of the delegates. Therefore, his opponent was expelled from the party and the internal autonomy conventions were approved. Outraged by the congress aftermath, Ben Youssef organized numerous meetings to demonstrate his influence. Inside the country, he gained the support of fellaghas who reprised the uprest. Bourguibist cells and French settlers were attacked. As for the fellaghas, it was necessary to get immediate independence, even with weaponry and put an end to Bourguiba&#x27;s power. The 1 June united Tunisia was definitely torn apart: Those who rallied Bourguiba and those who opposed him and joined Ben Youssef.

This troubled situation generated an era of civil war. Killings, arbitrary detention, torture in illegal private prisons, fellagas who took up arms against the Tunisian forces, abduction by militias and attacks by local adversaries caused dozens of dead and many injured. Due to this situation, French authorities decided to speed up the implementation of the autonomy agreements by transferring the law enforcement responsibility to the Tunisian government starting from 28 November. This decision did not please Ben Youssef who feared the jeopardizes of minister of the interior Mongi Slim. To thwart the decisions of the Congress of Sfax, he called for holding a second congress as soon as possible. However, he faced opposition from the Tunisian government. Soon, Ben Youssef was charged for inciting rebellion. Slim informed Ben Youssef that he were to be arrested by Tunisian policemen, which led him to flee out of the country. Clandestinly, he went to Tripoli, Libya, by crossing the Libyan-Tunisian borders on 28 January 1956. The following morning, three newspapers endorsing him were seized and 115 persons were arrested all around the country. The government decided to create a special criminal court, known as the High court to judge the rebels. Meanwhile, Ben Youssef insisted on his followers to resume the fight. The regional context was in his favor because the Maghreb ablazed for the liberation struggle and nationalists were quickly disappointed by the conventions of internal autonomy that left only a few limited powers to Tunisians.

Convinced that he must act, Bourguiba flew to Paris in February 1956 aiming to persuade the reluctant French authorities to start negotiations for total independence. On 20 March 1956, around 5:40 pm  in the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, the French minister of foreign affairs, Christian Pineau stated that &quot;France solemnly recognizes the independence of Tunisia&quot; and signed the Independence protocol along with Tahar Ben Ammar. The clauses put an end to Bardo Treaty. However, France kept its military base of Bizerte for many years. On 22 March, Bourguiba returned to Tunisia as the great winner and stated that &quot;After a transition period, all french forces must evacuate Tunisia, including Bizerte&quot;.

== 1956–1957: Prime minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia ==

Following independence, proclaimed on 20 March 1956, a National Constituent Assembly was elected, on 25 March, in order to write a constitution. Therefore, Bourguiba ran to represent the constituents of Monastir, as the Neo-Destour candidate. On 8 April, the assembly held its opening session, chaired by M&#x27;hamed Chenik while Al-Amine bey attended the ceremony. The same day, Bourguiba was elected as Speaker of the National Constituent Assembly and gave a speech, summarizing his ambitions for the country: 

With this new start, Tahar Ben Ammar&#x27;s mission as head of government had ended and therefore, he delivered his resignation to al-Amine bey. Therefore, the Neo-Destour nominated Bourguiba to be their candidate for the office, on 9 April. Bourguiba accepted and was officially invited by the bey, three days after his election as head of the assembly, to form a cabinet. On 15 April, Bourguiba introduced his cabinet including one deputy prime minister, Bahi Ladgham, two state ministers, eleven ministers and two secretaries of state. Furthermore, Bourguiba combined the offices of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense. Therefore, he became the 20th Head of government of Tunisia and the second of the Kingdom of Tunisia. He expressed, once officially inaugurated as Prime minister, his will to &quot;enforce sovereignty bases by perfecting the means inside the country and abroad, put this sovereignty only under the service of Tunisian&#x27;s interests, implementing a bold and judicious policy to free national economy from the chains of immobilism and unemployment.&quot;

As Prime minister, Bourguiba worked to secure total independence. Upon his nomination, the police switched from French management to Tunisian command, as he nominated Ismaïl Zouiten to be chief of police and the first Tunisian to hold this office. Meanwhile, French gendarmerie was replaced by the National Guard, on 3 October 1956. Bourguiba also reorganized Tunisia&#x27;s administrative divisions, creating a modern structure made of 14 governorates, divided in delegations and managed by appointed governors. Bourguiba also pursued negotiations with France in order to have full control over diplomacy, as France still had a say over foreign policy until an agreement was found. Despite that, Bourguiba created a Tunisian minister of Foreign affairs on 3 May and invited other countries to establish embassies and diplomatic relations. Therefore, he appointed 4 ambassadors in Arab countries and approved the United States and Turkey&#x27;s decision to start a diplomatic mission in Tunisia. Under pressure, France agreed with the opening of respective embassies and signed an agreement with the Tunisian government on 16 May. On 12 November, Tunisia became an official United Nations member.

Bourguiba also discussed defense issues with France, arguing that French military ought to evacuate the country. On 30 June, the Tunisian Armed Forces were founded, despite the remaining presence of French militaries. Bourguiba requested progressive evacuation upon the negotiations that started in July 1956. France did not seem to share his opinion as they wanted to suppress Algerian rebels using Tunisia&#x27;s military bases. After huge disagreements between both governments, the visit of Maurice Faure, French secretary of state for foreign affairs, ended up with the decision to regroup French forces in Bizerte within less than two years and the conclusion of a Franco-Tunisian military alliance. Nevertheless, Bourguiba refused to negotiate while the territory was still occupied and demanded the French forces to regroup in Bizerte immediately, arguing that the protectorate was over. Therefore, he travelled to the United Kingdom and the United States urging for their support.

During his premiership, Bourguiba started numerous reforms aiming to modernize Tunisian society and change their mentalities. On 31 May 1956, he abolished beylical privileges, which made royal princes and princesses equal to other citizens and punishable by law. The same day, he suppressed the property legislation of habous, deeply rooted in Islamic traditions. He also ended Ez-Zitouna Mosque&#x27;s education purposes by creating Ez-Zitouna University, which taught Islamic knowledge under the supervision of the ministry of Education. Likewise, Koranic schools were, from that moment on, under governmental oversight, the ministry preparing a detailed program and managing them. Furthermore, free education was proclaimed and teachers trained. Bourguiba also started a gender equality campaign, advocating for women rights including: universal education for girls equally with boys, women admission to employment under the same conditions as men, free consent to marriage and veil removal. Even though, conservatives were strongly opposed to his reforms, the campaign ended to be a huge success. On 13 August 1956, Bourguiba enacted the Code of Personal Status, a major legislation that reorganized families. Therefore, repudiation was replaced with divorce while woman had to consent to their marriages, suppression paternal agreement. In addition, polygyny was prohibited and equality between fathers and mothers but also between children was part of the law. Bourguiba also reformed the judicial system, suppressing religious courts and initiating governmental ones.

On the second anniversary of his return to Tunisia, on 1 June 1957, Bourguiba wanted to proclaim a Republic system, but the French-Tunisian relation crisis because of the suspension of the financial aid from France, adjourned the event. However, on 22 July, the Neo-Destour leadership invited the Constituent Assembly members to gather in a special meeting, on 25 July. The sitting started at 9:23 pm  in the throne room of Bardo Palace, chaired by Jallouli Fares. In the afternoon, the Republic was proclaimed, abolishing a 252 years old monarchy. The bey&#x27;s wealth was, therefore, seized by the government and was used to pay debts. With this changing of regime, Bourguiba was designated acting President of Tunisia until a constitution is adopted. Thus, Bourguiba&#x27;s cabinet was dissolved and a new one was appointed, abolishing the office of Prime minister.

== 1957–1987: Presidency ==

=== 1957–1962: Founder of Modern Tunisia ===

On 8 February 1958, the French army bombed the border village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef. Casualties were high with 72 dead and numerous injured. The very evening, Bourguiba declared the &quot;evacuation battle&quot; of Bizerte open. Thus, he proclaimed entry ban of every French warship into Tunisian waters, on 12 February. He also presented the National Constituent Assembly with a bill repealing the 1942 convention specifying that &quot;Bizerte was not part of Tunisian territory but was a French harbor&quot;. The bill was successfully adopted on 14 February.

Thanks to diplomatic pressure, he obtained from France total evacuation of Tunisian territory except for Bizerte. Three years later, following a deadly crisis in Bizerte, negotiations ended with the French evacuation of Tunisian lands, on 15 October 1963.

On 1 June 1959, the constitution was officially adopted. Thus, it was signed by President Bourguiba, during a ceremony held in Bardo. Furthermore, he addressed the nation to recall presciently the Caliphate era: 

Unlike his Arab counterparts, Bourguiba based his priorities on education and health, to the detriment of the army and defense. Therefore, he established a modern education system, appointing famous writer Mahmoud Messadi as his minister of education. Thus, he put an end to Koranic and westernized double teaching curriculum. Schools were therefore public and free. Bourguiba also abolished the dual system of justice, ended the influence of religion on the judiciary and established civil courts.

In February 1961, he invited his fellow citizens not to fast during Ramadan in order to struggle against underdevelopment and set the basis of a new modern state. In March 1964, he made the point by drinking openly on television, a glass of orange juice, during the day. His position on fasting and his speech on Muhammad, published by a Lebanese newspaper, started sharp criticism in the Muslim World and in 1974 Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz accused him of apostasy.

On 20 December 1962, the government announced the discovery of a conspiracy aiming to overthrow President Bourguiba and assassinate him. It was later discovered that the plot had been prepared by military and some civilians faithful to Ben Youssef. The conspiracy was discovered when a remorseful officer told Bahi Ladgham, Bourguiba&#x27;s second, about the plan, denounced the plot and gave names. He explained that tanks had to march from L&#x27;Aouina barrack to the Carthage Palace.

Among the culprits were Mahmoud El Materi&#x27;s nephew, Moncef El Materi, and the President&#x27;s Aide-de-camp. During trials, one of the charged under-officer stated that he shall never forgive Bourguiba for &quot;sacrificing them during Bizerte battle&quot;. Sentenced to death by the military court, eleven culprits were hanged. Furthermore, the Communist party of Tunisia and &quot;La Tribune du progrès&quot; magazine, close to that party, were banned.

=== 1960s: Socialist experiment and Arab diplomacy issues ===

Ahmed Ben Salah, rising star of the government and supporter of a socialist economic policy, was protected from other &quot;Tunisois&quot; (people originating from Tunis) minister&#x27;s attacks by Bourguiba who fully endorsed him: &quot;I am personally responsible for the plan that I put under my authority. Henceforth, this plan will be the party&#x27;s work&quot;. On 17 November 1961, Ben Salah was appointed in the party leadership, despite his failure in the Central committee elections during the Congress of Sousse in 1959.

Bourguiba&#x27;s remarriage with Wassila Ben Ammar, on 12 April 1962, was a missed occasion for the &quot;Tunisois&quot; to limit Ben Salah&#x27;s encroachment. This happened on 6 February 1963, Bourguiba proclaimed that the battle against underdevelopment was &quot;a struggle for human dignity and the glory of fatherland [...] In these circumstances, the restriction of freedoms and privileges of private property is needed when it comes to make it more productive use and more profitable for the community&quot;. In June, during a visit to Sfax, he stated: 

Therefore, he targeted trade sector: All traditional circuits were broken and replaced by a centralized network of state offices and cooperatives. He specifically aimed the trade provided by Djerbiens in which Ben Salah saw a conservative caste. On 28 April 1964, Bourguiba demanded the start of negotiations on agricultural lands detained by foreigners. In response, on 2 May, France notified the suspension of its financial aid. Bourguiba, therefore, decided to enact the nationalization of lands, on 12 May. However, peasantry did not want to integrate such a system. Indeed, bureaucracy weakened governmental ideology: While certain unities remained in Barren vegetation, other ended up acquiring more workers than necessary.

On 30 September, the first five-year plan ended up with 25% devaluation of the dinar. During the congress of Bizerte, the collectivist strategy was, nevertheless, confirmed with the establishment of the coexistence of three economic sectors (public, private and cooperative). The Neo-Destour was therefore, renamed as Socialist Destourian Party (SDP) and a central committee was formed including ministers, governors, regional party officers and some high officials. Based on communist party model. Thus, the leadership was no more elected but chosen by the president among the central committee. At the end of congress, to seize control of the Tunisian General Labour Union (TGLU), unique labor union of the country, the SDP decided to create, in all businesses, its own professional cells to compete with the labor ones. The presidential party, therefore, achieved its predominance over the country.

In July 1965, following an accident on a ship connecting Sfax to Kerkennah Islands, the TGLU chairman, Habib Achour was arrested and replaced at the head of the labour union. Since then, the State-party system and the Bourguiba-Ben Salah conjunction &quot;Plunged Tunisia into a headlong rush and whirlpool outbid that overshadowed elementary realities.&quot; Therefore, the first troubles started on 15 December in Msaken: The people protested against the obligation the 147 small farmers had to integrate new cooperatives of fruit trees, that would replace their 80000 olive trees. Following the events, the government proceeded to arrest of ten protesters and the disbandment of party cells that supported farmers.

During this period, Bourguiba distinguished himself from his Arab counterparts in foreign policy. Twenty years before Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat, he favored the normalization of relations with the State of Israel. During his visit to Middle-East, defying Gamal Abdel Nasser, he recalled in a speech he gave in Jericho, on 3 March 1965 that &quot;the policy of all or nothing had only led Palestine to defeat&quot;. He also proposed the United Nations the creation of a Federation between the Arab states of the region and Israel. In May of that same year, supported by public opinion, he broke off with the Arab League.

On 14 March, Bourguiba had a heart attack. Thenceforth, everyone thought he could die at any moment, and, since that very day, Bourguiba would think about his succession. On 5 June, the eruption of the Six-Day War started riots in Tunis: the American Cultural Center, the Great Synagogue and shopping avenue of London were looted and burned. On 25 January 1969, ordered to give in to the cooperative all their lands and orchards, Ouerdanin inhabitants revolted and opposed themselves to tractors. The uprising ended up with two deaths and dozens of injured, as the law enforcement forces fired. All around the country, troubles erupted for the same reasons: the refusal of an authoritary collectivization. On 3 August, Ben Salah presented Bourguiba with a decree-law bill about the generalization of the cooperative system in agriculture. But Bourguiba, advised by his minister not to sign the bill, refused to do so. The next day, he announced: 

On 8 September, a statement announcing the sacking of Ben Salah was made public by the presidency. On 8 June 1970, Bourguiba told the Tunisian people about the failure of this experiment saying: 

On 16 August, making a speech in Monastir, he denounced &quot;a vast conspiracy which aimed to establish fascism by revolutionary means&quot;.

=== 1970s: Blocked reforms and health problems ===

Bourguiba, henceforth, urged the adoption of reforms aiming to restructure both the State organization and the SDP one. Therefore, the party leadership switched from a political office to a high committee. Nevertheless, in the start of August, he announced his will to focus on a social and economic agenda, insisting on justice for the victims of collectivism and thus, put political issues aside.

The socialist era being over, the government was in the hands of liberal Hedi Nouira, appointed prime minister in 1970. In January 1971, before leaving for treatment in the United States, Bourguiba signed a decree, delegating his powers to Nouira, which consolidated the Achour-Nouira alliance, opposed to Minister of the Interior, Ahmed Mestiri. During the Congress of Monastir that started on 19 June, Bourguiba, returning after six months of treatment abroad, designated three successive &quot;heirs&quot;: &quot;It is with confidence that I foresee the day when my journey in this world comes to an end, Nouira shall succeed me as later will do Mestiri then Masmoudi&quot;. But the congress adopted a turning that seemed not to please the President. After Mestiri&#x27;s attempt to seize control of the party, Bourguiba suspended him, along with his allies and declared finished the works of the Central Committee: &quot;It is more than clear that, while I am still of this world, I will be maintained at the head of State&quot;.
In May 1973, Bourguiba met with Algerian President Houari Boumediene in Kef. He told him: &quot;The beginning is the union between Algeria and Tunisia. We will do it methodically but firmly [...] we will proceed in stages&quot;. Bourguiba, surprised by the proposition, suggested: &quot;Algeria can yield Constantine to restore a better geographical balance between the two countries&quot;. During an interview with the Egyptian weekly &quot;El Moussaouar&quot;, on 20 September, Bourguiba made a statement, sharing his thoughts about any further union project: 

In January 1974, Bourguiba met with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in Jerba. During this meeting, the idea of a possible union between Libya and Tunisia was introduced. At the end of the interview, the Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mohamed Masmoudi, stated: &quot;The two countries will form a single republic, the Arab Islamic Republic, with a single constitution, one flag, one president, one army and the same executive, legislative and judicial. A referendum will be organized on 18 January 1974&quot;. At the airport, Bourguiba declared to journalists: 

However, due to opposition inside the country and abroad, Bourguiba was forced to abandon the project, claiming the unconstitutionality of the referendum. It was in that context that the new congress of SPD, held in Monastir on 12 September, decided to amend the constitution in order to institute life presidency for Habib Bourguiba, who obtained this title from the National Assembly on 18 March 1975. The constitutional revision added a paragraph to Article 39 specifying that &quot;exceptionally and in consideration of the eminent services of &quot;Supreme Commander&quot; Habib Bourguiba to the Tunisian people that he freed from the yoke of colonialism and which he turned into a united independent modern nation, enjoying the fullness of sovereignty, the National Assembly proclaimed President Habib Bourguiba president for life&quot;. In April 1976, another constitutional amendment confirmed the Prime Minister as a constitutional successor to the President. During autumn, Bourguiba suffered from a depression which periodically affected him for five years. Locked in the Carthage palace, he hardly had visits.

Economically, the government still managed nearly 80% of the country&#x27;s economy, which involved it in almost all social conflicts. Indeed, businesses were the place of permanent conflict between the syndicalist cells of the TGLU and the professional cell of SPD.

In 1978, Bourguiba was obliged to denounce the Camp David Accords under the pressure of his partners, which had a part in Tunisia welcoming the headquarters of the Arab League then those of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

Despite its crisis, the 1970s was a period of economic revival, after the failure of socialism. Under Nouira, the government adopted an economy liberalization policy. Nevertheless, on 26 January 1978, Black Thursday occurred. Following the TGLU invitation to organize a general strike, thousands of protesters, mainly Tunisian youths, gathered near the medina, trading streets of downtown and bourgeois neighbourhoods of Belvédère and Mutuelleville. Violently, they destroyed showcases and set public buildings on fire. At noon, President Bourguiba gave the army orders to get involved and put an end to the uprising. The troubles ended with tens of dead, or even hundreds, according to some sources. In the afternoon, Bourguiba declared state of emergency and a curfew which lasted nearly three months. Twenty months after Black Thursday was held the next congress of SPD, opened on 5 September 1979. True to its ongoing strategy not to reopen wounds, Bourguiba gave the order to move on. In his opening speech, invoking the national interest, he called &quot;all Tunisians, despite their differences of opinion and guidance, to support state building, the instrument of national revival, security and stability&quot;. In this climate of apparent unity, the congress was held in ambiguity because the gap had widened between the president and the hawks rejecting openness and a multi-party system in the name of national unity. In this context, congress voted a resolution to exclude Achour, chairman of the TGLU from SPD along with numerous resigning ministers. The congress also tried to impose Nouira by electing him as chairman of the party. After Bourguiba&#x27;s speech, these decisions were not published but were announced only one on the National Radio.

=== 1980s: Succession of crises and fall from power ===

In that context, the 1980s started in Tunisia with a deep crisis. Clientelism began to grow more and more until it disabled economic and social development. The situation worsened with Bourguiba&#x27;s age, his declining health and his incapacity to manage state issues. Thus, it favored the ascension of an entourage which battled to succeed him, starting a succession war. The country, in that period, knew a serious political and social crisis, which worsened with the declining economy and the paralysis of the state machinery, spreading uneasiness, despair and loss of confidence. However, during the SPD congress of April 1981, Bourguiba made a historical speech in favor of political pluralism: 

However, this turning failed because of the internal electoral confrontation in the capital city, during parliamentary elections, and, despite the Prime minister, Mohamed Mzali&#x27;s efforts. Therefore, the war of succession worsened. In this context, Wassila Bourguiba, interviewed by &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot;, on 28 February 1982, stated that &quot;With the current version of the constitution, continuity is artificial and the risk of popular rejection is not excluded. The Tunisian people respects Bourguiba but true continuity will only happen when Bourguiba&#x27;s work is pursued by a democratically-elected president.&quot; Habib Achour, interviewed by the same magazine on 11 August, declared: &quot;I am for the review of the Constitution so that all candidates who wish can run for office freely&quot;. Bourguiba carried out his promises with the legalization of two new political parties, on 19 November 1983: The Movement of Socialist Democrats and the Popular Unity Party, former allies of Ben Salah.

A fall in the price of oil in late 1983 reduced the revenue of the Tunisian state, which was already struggling to meet rising expenses. President Bourguiba agreed to seek a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF loan was conditional on government spending cuts and other reforms. The government announced an end to food subsidies on 29 December 1983, causing an immediate rise in the price of bread and flour. The Tunisian bread riots started that day in the semi-desert region of Nefzaoua in the south, and on 3 January 1984 a state of emergency was declared after the unrest had spread to Tunis and Sfax.
By the time the protests ended on 5 January 1984, more than 150 rioters had been killed. President Bourguiba announced on 6 January 1984 that the increase in the price of bread and flour had been cancelled.

This spectacular turn of events raised the enthusiasm of the country. Paul Balta wrote in &quot;Le Monde&quot; on 10 January: &quot;The inhabitants of the red belts of Tunis and other large cities, often below the poverty line, joining the rebellion of disadvantaged populations inside the country, have expressed anger more violently and in greater numbers than the events of 26 January 1978. As for Mohamed Charfi, &quot;It is a society crisis&quot;, he said on 27 January. &quot;Social changes were not accompanied by political changes [...] thus, the breakdown between permanent social changes and political frost is the origin of the regime crisis&quot;. In addition, Mohamed Toumi declared: &quot;Those that official statements call the unemployed, idle, hostile elements, that is to say victims of bad development [...] are in organic break with everything that makes up the establishment, government and legal opposition mingled&quot;.

On 1 October 1985, Israel launched an attack against the Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters near Tunis. The Tunisian Armed Forces were unable to prevent the total destruction of the base. Although most of the dead were PLO members, there were casualties among Tunisian civilian bystanders. As a result, Bourguiba significantly downscaled relations with the United States.

Domestically, Prime Minister Mzali emptied Bourguiba&#x27;s entourage. In July 1985, he replaced presidential ally Allala Laouiti with Mansour Skhiri. He also succeeded in sending away from Carthage, Bourguiba Jr., advisor to the President sacked by his father on 7 January 1986. Aiming to put an end to the serious economic crisis, Bourguiba replaced Mzali and appointed his replacement, Rachid Sfar, on 8 July 1986. These endless crises favored the rise of Islamism and strengthened Bourguiba&#x27;s paranoia. He sought support against Islamism from General Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, whom he appointed interior minister in 1986 and prime minister in October 1987.

Bourguiba had been in ill health from the 1970s onward. As the 1980s wore on, his behavior grew more erratic. He fired the general manager of a major newspaper only 24 hours after appointing him. He also fired the head of the country&#x27;s United Nations delegation only a few days after appointing him, and forgot about a decree he had signed to appoint new ministers. Matters came to a head in November 1987, when he ordered new trials for fifteen Islamists and demanded that twelve of them be hanged by the next weekend. This latest order convinced several opponents and supporters of Bourguiba that he was no longer acting or thinking rationally; one human rights activist said that his orders would have triggered a civil war. After several doctors attending to Bourguiba issued a report declaring that Bourguiba was mentally incapable of carrying out his duties, Prime Minister Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, who had been appointed to the post only a month earlier, removed Bourguiba from office and assumed the presidency himself in the so-called &quot;medical coup d&#x27;état.&quot; Starting in a liberal secular atmosphere, Bourguiba&#x27;s presidency or &quot;reign&quot; ended in a climate of economic and financial crisis.

== Post-presidency ==


To avoid his reinstatement by opponents, Bourguiba was evacuated from Carthage Palace, a few days after 7 November 1987, to be transferred into a house in Mornag then, to Monastir, on 22 October 1988 where he enjoyed medical assistance. He stated being well treated by the new regime. Suffering from numerous health problems, including slurred speech and attention deficits, Bourguiba went through serious diseases during the 1990s. He was, sometimes, visited by foreigners and President Ben Ali.

==Death==
On 5 March 2000, Bourguiba was rushed to the Tunis military hospital, following a pneumonitis. His condition deemed critical, he underwent thoracentesis while in the ICU. His health improved, he left hospital on 13 March to get back to his house in Monastir. He died there at officially 96 years old, on 6 April 2000 at 9:50 pm. President Ben Ali, therefore, proclaimed seven days of national mourning while Algeria announced three days of national mourning. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika stated that Bourguiba was &quot;One of the Maghreb most influential personalities of the 20th century, which Africa and the entire world can boast&quot;. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, paid a tribute to &quot;the man of peace&quot; and to &quot;the architect of the Organization of African Unity&quot;.

At the end of the afternoon, his body was wrapped in a white shroud, as the tradition wanted it, and carried by Chabiba members, the youth organization of the Democratic Constitutional Rally, wearing redcoats. It was deposited in the middle of the familial house, covered with the Tunisian national flag and surrounded by Chabiba members. His son, Habib Jr., his daughter-in-law and his adoptive daughter Hajer received condolences of Monastir City and Governorate&#x27;s officials. Bourguiba was buried on 8 April, in the afternoon, in his mausoleum. After a short ceremony at the Hanafi Mosque of Bourguiba, his body was transported on a gun carriage, coated with the national flag and carried by a military vehicle framed by detachments of the Tunisian army. Among the foreign guests were French President Jacques Chirac, Algerian Bouteflika, Palestinian Yasser Arafat and Egyptian Hosni Mubarak. After the burial, President Ben Ali pronounced a eulogy in which he paid a tribute to the &quot;Loyal and devoted fight&quot; of Bourguiba for Tunisia.

The funeral conditions were, however, submitted to the criticism of international media that insisted on the brevity of the ceremony, the few foreign guests and the absence of TV broadcast which transmitted animal ceremonies during the funeral procession.

== Legacy ==
Habib Bourguiba led Tunisia to independence, and founded the second civil republic in the Arab world after that of Lebanon. He then implemented a series of &quot;Tunisification&quot; policies to bring forward the building of a nation-state.

As for former minister Mohamed Charfi, subsequent transformations of the Tunisian society brought by the action of Bourguiba are numerous: urbanization, education, transition to another family model and women&#x27;s liberation. He also insisted on the part Bourguiba had in reforming the country, alongside other great personalities in Tunisia history, such as Kheireddine Pacha and Tahar Haddad. &quot;If underdevelopment were a sickness, then Bourguiba was able to make the right diagnosis and implement effective remedies&quot;. However, others question the extent of success in this battle for development and the role Bourguiba had in this evolution.

=== Bourguibism ===
Bourguiba had developed his own doctrine that he called &quot;Bourguibism&quot; but which is similar to pragmatism. It was founded on the political and economic realism which is based on the belief that &quot;no field of life on earth should escape the human power of reason&quot;. It also contained elements of populist and corporatist discourse, support for the welfare state, and until the Tunisian Revolution, its followers generally followed a statist outlook.

Considered in several respects a local variant of Kemalism, it consists of the assertion of the Tunisian national identity, incorporating the fight against the Ottomans and the French, of liberalism, a nationalized and controlled Islam and total independence towards the politics of other nearby Arab nations. Step-by-step policy is a major part of Bourguiba&#x27;s doctrine. Bourguiba thought in this manner mainly because the actions were based on what he considered real possibilities, not aspirations, unlike &quot;the all or nothing&quot; policy, advocated and supported by some.

In reality, it permitted Bourguiba to enjoy a freedom of action that led him to political opportunism, allowing him to impose not only breakthrough changes but also spectacular turnabouts.

=== Social reforms ===

The Bourguiba government&#x27;s reforms included female emancipation, public education, family planning, a modern, state-run healthcare system, a campaign to improve literacy, administrative, financial and economic organization, suppression of religious property endowments, known as Waqf, and building the country&#x27;s infrastructure.

In his social agenda, Bourguiba advocated for women&#x27;s rights. Thus, he enacted the Code of Personal Status, ratified on 13 August 1956, a few months after he had taken office, as Prime minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia. Inspired by the views of Tahar Haddad, who was a Women&#x27;s rights defender, Bourguiba based this law on his ideas, emancipating women, despite the then-conservative public opinion. Bourguiba understood the opposition he would face but decided to act, before even building the Republic. Nevertheless, he was supported by some religious personalities, such as Mohamed Fadhel Ben Achour, who defended Bourguiba&#x27;s reform, stating that the CPS are possible interpretations of Islam. However, others did not share these views and said that the CPS was violating Islamic norms. The Personal Status Code would, then, constitute the fundamental legacy of Habib Bourguiba, to the point of becoming a sort of consensus block that the Islamists themselves would not challenge publicly anymore. Nevertheless, he succeeded in setting important legal precedents by prohibiting polygamy, expanding women&#x27;s access to divorce, and raising the age at which girls could marry to 17 years old, expanding women&#x27;s rights.

Establishing a parallel with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Mohamed Charfi advocated that Bourguiba wanted to reform society &quot;within Islam&quot; and not against it. This transforming society and its modernization was accompanied by an explanation consisting of a modulated action, according to which public Bourguiba addressed. This reformer dimension is nevertheless questioned by author Hélé Béji, who draws attention to the transgressive nature of many of Bourguiba&#x27;s gestures, particularly in women&#x27;s status. Furthermore, Jean Daniel mentioned a conversation between Bourguiba and Jacques Berque about Islam. For Bourguiba, religion, associated to the Destourian party, had historically favored the colonization of Tunisia. On the other hand, Charfi opposed this idea, stating that the undeniable break carried out by Bourguiba occurred more with traditional society than with Islam, as such.

Bourguiba was very critical of the veil, on various occasions referring to it as &quot;that odious rag&quot;.

During the time Bourguiba was president, education was a high priority, as he reformed the total educative system and permitted its development. State budget in education did not cease to increase year after year to reach 32% in 1976. Private schools were maintained but submitted to government regulations. In 1958, the Arabic teaching of Ez-Zitouna University was unified into a bilingual educative system. Since 1956, Bourguiba started to build the foundations of higher education in Tunisia, including the creation of universities and specialized institutes.

=== Foreign policy ===

Regarding his foreign policy, Jean Lacouture indicated that Bourguiba maintained relations with France, even if problematic to the East. Lacouture testified on Bourguiba&#x27;s anger when he was proposed &quot;co-sovereignty&quot; back in 1955. It was the struggle for his country&#x27;s independence, that sparked misunderstandings with the Arab League countries, but which will be, on the other hand, better understood by the United States with whom Bourguiba established strong relations. As for him, unlike other leaders in the Arab world, he believed that non-alignment did not equate to anti-Americanism.

Furthermore, Bourguiba was a strong supporter of Francophonie alongside Léopold Sédar Senghor and Hamani Diori, and he became its active ambassador during his tour in Africa in 1965. According to him, the French language and Francophonie competed to build an open modern Tunisia.

=== One-party state ===

Bourguiba, who advocated independence insisting on the maturity of the Tunisian people, ended up judging that his country was not prepared for democracy and political pluralism and proclaimed himself president for life. As for him, &quot;the people were not yet mature enough for democracy&quot; which evaded in the name of the unity his project was involving. Consequently, once the bases of a modern state were built, Bourguiba gradually chose a &quot;paternalistic authoritarian&quot; regime. This culminated in the Neo Destour being formally declared the only legally permitted party in 1963.

Consequently, political democracy in the Western sense was more or less nonexistent. The constitution vested Bourguiba with sweeping—almost dictatorial—powers. Bourguiba himself admitted this when a journalist asked him about Tunisia&#x27;s political system. Bourguiba replied, &quot;The system? What system? &quot;I&quot; am the system.&quot; In this context, Bourguiba&#x27;s party became an &quot;alibi in an ideological desert&quot;.

=== Power of one ===

It is important to specify that, during his conquest and exercise of power, he systematically rejected all his allies who became rivals: Abdelaziz Thâalbi and Mohieddine Klibi, who represented the bourgeoise faction of Destour; Salah Ben Youssef, supported by Nasser, whom he assassinated in 1961. Tahar Ben Ammar who ratified the independence protocol ; Ahmed Mestiri, who represented the liberal faction among his party ; Mahmoud El Materi, the first president of Neo-Destour, who was discredited many times and, losing confidence in Bourguiba, decided to retire.

Yet Bourguiba himself made the diagnosis of the dangers of political archaism that threatened the country. On 8 June 1970, after noting that &quot;experience &quot;[reveals]&quot; that the concentration of power in the hands of an only one person, as devoted as he is, has risks&quot;, he described the great lines of the institutional reform he considered, back then. It will focus, he announced, on &quot;amendments &quot;[that]&quot; will make the cabinet responsible to the President of the Republic but also to the National Assembly which emerged from popular vote. So it shall be lawful for the assembly to impeach a minister or a cabinet by a vote against it [...]. Other modifications of the constitution will ease the responsibilities undertaken so far by the president and only by himself [...] After fifteen years of exercise of power, it is time to revise the Constitution and establish some collaboration between the head of State, the national Assembly and the people&quot;. But the spirit of this reform did not meet these commitments, only the spirit of Article 39 (establishing the life presidency) would prevail.

The end of his reign was marked by a war of succession, the weakening of the left and the emergence of the Islamist movement and patrimonialism.

== Personal life ==

In 1925, while a student in Paris, Habib Bourguiba met Mathilde Lorrain with whom he settled. During summer vacations back in Tunis, he learned that she was pregnant: Habib Bourguiba Jr., his only child, was born on 9 April 1927 in Paris. The couple married in August of the same year, after their return to Tunisia. After independence, Mathilde obtained Tunisian citizenship, converted to Islam and adopted the name of Moufida. On 21 July 1961, they ended up divorcing.

On 12 April 1962, Bourguiba married Wassila Ben Ammar, a woman from a family of Tunis bourgeoisie he had known for 18 years. Together, they adopted a girl named Hajer. Wassila took a larger part in politics over the deteriorating health of her husband, which would give her the title of &quot;Majda&quot; (Venerable). The couple divorced on 11 August 1986, with a mere statement and without any respected legal proceedings.

<doc id="391489" wikidata="Q1145308" url="?curid=391489" title="John Smoltz">
<text>John Andrew Smoltz (born May 15, 1967), nicknamed &quot;Smoltzie&quot; and &quot;Marmaduke&quot;, is an American former baseball pitcher who played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1988 to 2009, all but the last year with the Atlanta Braves. An eight-time All-Star, Smoltz was part of a celebrated trio of starting pitchers, along with Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, who propelled Atlanta to perennial pennant contention in the 1990s, highlighted by a championship in the 1995 World Series. He won the National League (NL) Cy Young Award in 1996 after posting a record of 24–8, equaling the most victories by an NL pitcher since 1972. He also played for the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals.

Though predominantly known as a starter, Smoltz was converted to a reliever in 2001 after his recovery from Tommy John surgery, and spent four years as the team&#x27;s closer before returning to a starting role. In 2002, he set a National League record with 55 saves and became only the second pitcher in history (joining Dennis Eckersley) to record both a 20-win season and a 50-save season. He is the only pitcher in Major League history to record both 200 wins and 150 saves. He is also the only pitcher in Major League history to record 200 wins, 150 saves, and 3,000 strikeouts.

Smoltz was one of the most successful pitchers in playoff history, posting a record of 15–4 with a 2.67 earned run average (ERA) in 41 career postseason games, (and in two of those four losses, he surrendered only unearned runs). He was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1992 NL Championship Series; Andy Pettitte later broke his record for career postseason wins. Smoltz led the NL in wins, winning percentage, strikeouts and innings pitched twice each, and his NL total of 3,084 strikeouts ranked fifth in league history when he retired. He also holds the Braves franchise record for career strikeouts (3,011), and the record for the most career games pitched for the Braves (708) since the club&#x27;s move to Atlanta in 1966; from 2004 to 2014, he held the franchise record for career saves and has the single season record. Smoltz left the Braves after 2008 and split his final season with the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals. Since retiring as a player, he has served as a color commentator and analyst for both Fox Sports and MLB Network. Since 2016, he has provided color commentary during baseball&#x27;s biggest televised events, notably the All-Star Game and World Series. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2015.

==Early life==
John Andrew Smoltz was born on May 15, 1967, in Warren, Michigan. Smoltz was an All-State baseball player at Waverly High School in Lansing, Michigan, where he played two seasons after transferring from Lansing Catholic High School. He was also an all-conference basketball player as a guard in high school, drawing some interest from college coaches. He elected to concentrate on baseball.

Following his high school career, Smoltz committed to play baseball at Michigan State University but elected to sign a professional contract after being drafted by the Detroit Tigers and receiving a substantial bonus offer.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The Detroit Tigers selected him in the 22nd round of the 1985 amateur draft. He was the 574th selection of the draft. Smoltz played initially for the Class A Lakeland Tigers minor-league team, and then moved on to the Class AA Glens Falls Tigers in 1987, posting records of 7–8 and 4–10. In 1987, the Tigers were in a three-team race, chasing the Toronto Blue Jays for the AL East division lead; in need of pitching help, Detroit sent their 20-year-old prospect to the Braves for 36-year-old veteran Doyle Alexander on August 12. While Alexander did help the Tigers overtake the Blue Jays for the division title, going 9–0 down the stretch, he was out of baseball by 1989. Smoltz, in contrast, became one of the cornerstones of the Braves franchise for the next two decades.

===Atlanta Braves (1988–1999, 2001–2008)===
====Early years (1988–1997)====
Smoltz made his major league debut on July 23, 1988. He posted poor statistics in a dozen starts, but in 1989 Smoltz blossomed. In 29 starts, he recorded a 12–11 record and 2.94 ERA while pitching 208 innings, and was named to the NL All-Star team. Teammate Tom Glavine also had his first good year in 1989, raising optimism about the future of Atlanta&#x27;s pitching staff. Over his career, Smoltz threw a four-seam fastball that was clocked as high as 98 miles per hour, a strong, effective slider and an 88–91 mph split-finger fastball that he used as a strikeout pitch. He also used a curveball and change-up on occasion, and in 1999, he began experimenting with both a knuckleball and a screwball, though he rarely used either in game situations. He admitted in 2016 that he never learned to throw sliders until he reached the Majors, nor does he recommend to children to throw sliders.

Smoltz began the 1991 season with a 2–11 record. He began seeing a sports psychologist, after which he closed out the season on a 12–2 pace, helping the Braves win a tight NL West race. His winning ways continued into the 1991 National League Championship Series. Smoltz won both his starts against the Pittsburgh Pirates, capped by a complete game shutout in the seventh game, propelling the Braves to their first World Series since moving to Atlanta in 1966. Smoltz had two no-decisions against the Minnesota Twins, with a 1.26 ERA. In the seventh and deciding game, he faced his former Detroit Tiger hero, Jack Morris. Both starters pitched shutout ball for seven innings, before Smoltz was removed from the scoreless game during a Twins threat in the eighth. Atlanta reliever Mike Stanton pitched out of the jam, getting Smoltz off the hook, and Morris eventually pitched a 10-inning complete-game victory.

The next year, Smoltz won 15 regular-season games and was the MVP of the 1992 National League Championship Series, winning two games. He left the seventh game trailing, but ended up with a no-decision as the Braves mounted a dramatic ninth-inning comeback win. In the World Series that year, Smoltz started two of the six games in the series, with a no-decision in Game 2 and a win with the Braves facing elimination in Game 5. Before the 1993 season, the Braves signed renowned control pitcher Greg Maddux, completing — along with Smoltz and Glavine — what many consider to be the most accomplished starting trio ever assembled on a single major-league team. Smoltz again won 15 games, but suffered his first postseason loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS despite not allowing an earned run.

Smoltz had a 6–10 record in the strike-shortened 1994 season, and during the break, had bone chips removed from his elbow. Returning as the Braves&#x27; No. 3 starter, he posted a 12–7 record in 1995. Ironically, the year the Braves won their one World Series title in their long run of division titles was the one year Smoltz had shaky postseason numbers. He did avoid being tagged with any losses despite a 6.60 ERA, but his Game 3 start in that World Series was his only poor World Series start in his career, getting knocked out in the third inning. But Smoltz and the Braves won the franchise&#x27;s first World Series in Atlanta, thanks in great part to Maddux and Glavine, who had begun to overshadow Smoltz. Smoltz would have been the Game 7 starter had the series gone that far.

In 1996, Smoltz went 24–8 with a 2.94 ERA and 276 strikeouts, including winning a franchise-record 14 straight decisions from April 9 to June 19. His wins and strikeout totals led the majors that year. Smoltz continued to pitch brilliantly in the postseason, winning a game in the Division Series, two more in the League Championship Series, and somehow ending up only 1–1 in the World Series despite a 0.64 ERA, losing Game 5 1–0 on an unearned run. He won the NL Cy Young Award with 26 of the 28 first-place votes. Smoltz&#x27;s effectiveness in 1997 was only slightly less than in his Cy Young season, but frugal run support limited him to a 15–12 record. Smoltz also received a Silver Slugger Award for his batting, as he led all pitchers with 18 base hits.

====Injuries and move to the bullpen (1998–2004)====
Smoltz continued to post excellent statistics in 1998 and 1999, but he was spending significant time on the disabled list and missed about a quarter of his starts. In 1999, Smoltz began experimenting with both a knuckleball and a three-quarters delivery, though he rarely used either in game situations. He underwent Tommy John surgery before the 2000 season, and missed the entire year. When he was unable to perform effectively as a starter in 2001, Smoltz transitioned to the bullpen, replacing John Rocker as the Braves&#x27; closer.

In 2002, his first full season as a closer, Smoltz set a National League record with 55 saves, topping the previous mark of 53, shared by Randy Myers (1993) and Trevor Hoffman (1998). Smoltz finished third in the Cy Young Award voting; Éric Gagné equaled his record a year later with the Dodgers. Injuries limited Smoltz slightly in 2003, but he still recorded 45 saves with a 1.12 ERA in innings pitched. In 2004, Smoltz finished with 44 saves, but was frustrated with his inability to make an impact as a closer during another Braves&#x27; postseason loss. That year, he broke Gene Garber&#x27;s franchise record of 141 career saves; his final total of 154 saves was eventually surpassed by Craig Kimbrel in 2014. By this point, Smoltz was the final remaining member of the Braves&#x27; dominant rotation of the 1990s. Glavine had moved on to play for the Mets, a divisional rival, while Maddux returned to his old team, the Chicago Cubs.

====Return to the rotation (2005–2008)====
After three years as a closer, Smoltz returned to the starting rotation entering the 2005 season. His renewed career as a starter began inauspiciously. He allowed six earned runs in only 1 innings—matching the shortest starts of his career—as the Braves were blown out on Opening Day by the Marlins. Poor run support contributed to an 0–3 start despite stronger pitching performances by Smoltz. After these initial difficulties, though, things fell into place. At the All-Star break, Smoltz was 9–5 with an ERA of 2.68 and was chosen for the 2005 NL All-Star team. Smoltz gave up a solo home run to Miguel Tejada in the second inning of the American League&#x27;s 7–5 victory and was charged with the loss. For his career, he was 1–2 in All-Star games, putting him in a tie for the most losses.

Smoltz finished 2005 at 14–7, with a 3.06 ERA and 169 strikeouts while allowing less than one hit per inning. Smoltz had answered the critics who doubted he would be able to reach the 200-inning plateau after three years in the bullpen. Nonetheless, Smoltz&#x27;s increased workload caused him to wear down toward the end of the season.

Despite a sore shoulder, Smoltz pitched seven innings in the Braves&#x27; 7–1 win over the Houston Astros in Game 2 of the 2005 NL Division Series; it was the only game the Braves won in the series against the eventual National League champions. The victory over Houston gave Smoltz a 13–4 record as a starter (15–4 overall) with a 2.65 ERA in the postseason. In two of those post-season losses, he surrendered only unearned runs. He has the second-most postseason wins (15) behind only Andy Pettitte with 19. They are followed by Glavine (14) and Maddux (11).

In 2006, Smoltz finished the season with a record of 16–9, an ERA of 3.49, and 211 strikeouts. He was one of four pitchers tied for the NL lead in wins, and was third in strikeouts.
On September 21, 2006, the Braves announced they had picked up Smoltz&#x27;s $8 million contract option for the 2007 season. On April 26, 2007, Smoltz agreed to a contract extension with the Braves. The extension includes a $14 million salary for the 2008 season, a $12 million vesting option for 2009 dependent on his ability to pitch 200 innings in 2008 and a $12 or $13 million team option for 2010 dependent on his ability to pitch 200 innings in 2009.

2007 was a year of reunions and milestones for Smoltz. On May 9, he faced Maddux for the first time since July 10, 1992. Smoltz earned a win in a 3–2 victory over the San Diego Padres; Maddux received no decision. On May 24, exactly 11 years to the day after recording his 100th win, Smoltz recorded his 200th win against Glavine. He faced Glavine three other times, faring 3–1 overall against him. On June 27, Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux each recorded wins on the same day. On August 19, Smoltz set the Braves strikeout record by striking out the Arizona Diamondbacks&#x27; Mark Reynolds. It was his 2,913th strikeout, passing Phil Niekro on the club&#x27;s all-time list; he struck out a season-high 12 in the game. He finished the year 14–8 with a 3.11 ERA and 197 strikeouts. The stalwart pitcher was the only holdover on the Braves roster from their 1991 worst-to-first season until Glavine returned to the Braves after an absence of several years following the 2007 season.

On April 22, 2008, Smoltz became the 16th pitcher in Major League history to reach 3,000 career strikeouts, and the fourth pitcher to strike out 3,000 batters for one team, joining Walter Johnson, Bob Gibson and Steve Carlton.

On April 28, 2008, Smoltz was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to an inflamed right shoulder.

====Return to relief (2008)====
On May 1, 2008, Smoltz indicated that he intended to return to being a relief pitcher. After coming off the disabled list on June 2, 2008, he blew his first save opportunity in three years. Two days later, the Braves placed him back on the disabled list. Smoltz underwent season-ending shoulder surgery on June 10, 2008. His contract expired at the end of the season, and the contract offer from the Braves was not sufficient to keep him.

===Boston Red Sox (2009)===

In December 2008, several members of the Boston Red Sox organization, including pitching coach John Farrell, vice president of player personnel Ben Cherington and assistant trainer Mike Reinold, flew to Atlanta to participate in a 90-minute workout with Smoltz. Throwing for only the second time since having surgery on a torn labrum in his pitching shoulder, Smoltz threw a 50-pitch side session and showcased his progress since the surgery. He impressed the Red Sox enough during the workout that less than a month later, a one-year contract was offered by the organization.

On January 13, 2009, Smoltz signed a one-year contract with the Red Sox for a reported base salary of $5.5 million with roster time incentives and miscellaneous award incentives which could net as much as $10 million. He made his first start in the Red Sox rotation on June 25, allowing seven hits and five runs through five innings. Smoltz posted a 2–5 record over eight games with an 8.32 ERA and no quality starts. He was designated for assignment on August 7 after a 13–6 loss to the New York Yankees, giving the Red Sox ten days to release or trade him, or send him to the minors. The Red Sox offered Smoltz a minor league stint in order to prepare him to be placed in the bullpen, but he rejected the offer. On August 17, the Red Sox released Smoltz.

===St. Louis Cardinals (2009)===

On August 19, 2009, Smoltz signed with the St. Louis Cardinals; he made his debut against the Padres on August 23. In his first game for the Cardinals, he went five innings, striking out nine and walking none, while setting a Cardinals franchise record by striking out seven batters in a row.

That win against the Padres was his only win with St. Louis that season. Smoltz finished 1–3 with an ERA of 4.26 with the Cardinals. He was 3–8 with an ERA of 6.35 overall with the Red Sox and Cardinals. In Game 3 of the 2009 NL Division Series, Smoltz pitched two innings of relief in a losing cause, allowing four hits and an earned run while striking out five.

==Post-playing career==
In 2008 and 2010, Smoltz served as a color analyst alongside Joe Simpson for Braves games on Peachtree TV. Nationally, Smoltz has been an analyst for MLB Network and called regular-season and postseason games for TBS. In 2014, he was hired by Fox Sports as a game analyst. He was paired with Matt Vasgersian and called games in the No. 2 booth. He has also joined Fox Sports South and SportSouth to be an analyst for select Braves games during the 2014 season. Smoltz replaced Harold Reynolds and Tom Verducci, his colleagues from MLB Network, as the lead analyst for &quot;Major League Baseball on Fox&quot; for the 2016 season, teaming up with Joe Buck and, later, Joe Davis. In 2021, Smoltz won his first Sports Emmy Award as an Event Analyst. Smoltz was forced to end his in-studio work for MLB Network after he refused to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, which is required for the company&#x27;s employees.
On April 16, 2012, the Braves announced that they would retire Smoltz&#x27;s number 29. The ceremony, which took place before a June 8 game against the Toronto Blue Jays, included speeches by former broadcaster Pete van Wieren, former teammate Matt Diaz and former manager Bobby Cox.

Smoltz was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2015. He was the first starting pitcher since 1987 to be elected despite having fewer than 250 wins and only one Cy Young Award, the first such starter ever elected on the first ballot, and the first pitcher to have Tommy John surgery and be elected to the Hall.

==Personal life==
Smoltz met his first wife, Dyan Struble, at the Omni Hotel in downtown Atlanta; the couple had four children before divorcing in 2007 after 16 years of marriage. Smoltz lives in Alpharetta, Georgia and also has a home at Sea Island, a golf resort. On May 16, 2009, Smoltz married Kathryn Darden at his home with 70 friends and family in attendance. Smoltz is a Christian.

Smoltz is a good friend of pro golfer Tiger Woods; the two often play golf together. Woods has stated that Smoltz is the best golfer outside of the PGA Tour that he has seen. Smoltz has stated that he once had a plus 4 handicap. In 2018, Smoltz qualified for the U.S. Senior Open, one of senior golf&#x27;s major championships. He is also involved in the sport of bowling.

Smoltz plays every year in the American Century Championship at Lake Tahoe. He won the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions in Orlando in January 2019.

Smoltz counts Doc Rivers as a personal friend dating back to Rivers&#x27; playing days in Atlanta. In the January 12, 2008, edition of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, Rivers is quoted as saying, &quot;I offered him my apartment... I just told him about Terry (Francona) and the Red Sox organization. I told him it&#x27;s a no-brainer.&quot;

Smoltz is also an accomplished accordionist and has starred in a television commercial for The Home Depot.

Smoltz is a distant cousin of fellow Baseball Hall of Famer Charlie Gehringer.

===Politics===
Smoltz produced an automated campaign phone recording on behalf of the candidacy of Ralph E. Reed, Jr. for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia during the 2006 primary.

In a 2004 interview, Smoltz was quoted as comparing the legalization of gay marriage with bestiality, saying &quot;What’s next? Marrying an animal?&quot; per the Associated Press. Smoltz later stated the article had portrayed his quote inaccurately.

It was speculated that Smoltz might run for Congress in 2010 as a Republican candidate to fill the departing John Linder&#x27;s seat in Georgia&#x27;s 7th congressional district.

On April 22, 2012, Smoltz hosted a fundraiser for Andrea Cascarilla, a Democratic candidate for State Representative in Michigan&#x27;s 71st House District. The 71st District encompasses Waverly Senior High School, where Smoltz was an All-State baseball and basketball player.

===Philanthropy===
Smoltz and his good friend Jeff Foxworthy hosted the charity event &quot;An Evening With Smoltz and Friends&quot; on November 9, 2008, at the Verizon Amphitheater in Alpharetta to raise money for the John Smoltz Foundation, which has supported numerous charitable endeavors in the Atlanta area over the past decade.

Smoltz is the Atlanta host for Big League Impact, an eight-city fantasy football network created and led by longtime Cardinals pitcher and former teammate Adam Wainwright. In 2015, the organization raised more than $1 million for various charitable organizations.

Smoltz and fellow former Atlanta Braves first baseman Ryan Klesko were named in a tax dispute involving conservation easement for a 1,546-acre non-cash donation the two made on behalf of a partnership the two formed in the early 1990s. On 25 April 2024, the court cleared the two of fraud charges, but reduced the assessed value of the donated easement to one-tenth of the claimed amount, and imposed a 40% penalty.

<doc id="391492" wikidata="Q5302871" url="?curid=391492" title="Down These Mean Streets">
<text>Down These Mean Streets is a memoir by Piri Thomas, a Latino of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent who grew up in Spanish Harlem, a section of Harlem in New York with a large Puerto Rican population. The book follows Piri through the first few decades of his life as he lives in poverty, joins and fights with street gangs, faces racism (in both New York City and elsewhere), travels, develops an addiction to heroin, gets involved in crime, is imprisoned, and is finally released.

One of the major themes of &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; centers on Piri Thomas&#x27; identity as a dark-complexioned Puerto Rican. Although he is of Puerto Rican and Cuban heritage, he is seen as black rather than Hispanic or Latino. His own family rejects the African aspect of their Latino-Caribbean ancestry, causing Piri to spend much of his youth and early adult life contemplating his racial and ethnic identity.

The book was originally published in 1967. A special Thirtieth Anniversary Edition in 1997 included a new afterword from the author. A sequel, &quot;7 Long Times&quot;, gives more depth to his prison years.

==Plot summary==
The story begins in Harlem, 1941, where Piri is living with his family. Piri&#x27;s father has a job with the Works Progress Administration, while his mother stays at home with the children. After the death of Piri’s baby brother Ricardo, the family moves to the Italian section on 114th Street. Piri has various encounters with the local kids in the street, and despite various fights, Piri earns the Italians&#x27; respect by not ratting on them. When the family moves back to Spanish Harlem, Piri joins a Puerto Rican gang called the TNTs.

Piri and his family move to the Long Island suburbs. Piri plays baseball with classmates and attends a school dance where he flirts with a girl named Marcia; however, Piri is shocked to hear a group of girls talking about his skin color. This, along with Poppa seeing another woman, makes Piri very upset.

Three months later, Piri returns to Harlem and finds himself homeless. Desperate for cash, Piri searches for work and goes after a position as a sales representative. He begins a relationship with Trina Diaz and makes a new friend named Brew, who forces Piri to further question his own identity. Piri and Brew discuss heading South so that Piri can discover what it means to be a black man.

Piri argues with his brother José because José does not understand why Piri wants to go South; in his view, Piri is Puerto Rican, not black. Piri identifies as being Afro-Latino and has a darker complexion. However, his family claims it is from his father as he had indigenous roots. There is a discourse between his family and Piri and it demonstrates the ingrained colorism in his family. Poppa makes an effort to relate to and comfort Piri, but Piri still decides to leave, despite the objections from his family. Through his various encounters down South, Piri realizes that every place he goes to, no matter what language you speak or where you come from, if you are black, then you are black.

Shortly after Piri heads back to New York, Momma dies and Piri goes back to living on the streets. He develops an addiction to heroin and begins to sell everything he can to have money for heroin.

While Trina is in Puerto Rico, Piri impregnates a different Puerto Rican woman, Dulcien. Piri buys tickets for Dulcien to go back to New York with the baby. Piri also convinces Louie to get into business again; they, along with Billy and Danny, carry out a robbery of a bar/discotheque in downtown New York. During the robbery, Piri is shot in the chest, and upon trying to escape back to Harlem, he shoots the police officer who shot him.

Piri wakes up in the hospital, is questioned by police and is transferred to prison to await trial. He is sentenced to no more than 5–15 years for armed robbery. In prison, he studies masonry, works in construction and achieves his high school diploma as well as other educational certificates. Piri describes the encounters he has with other inmates. Piri is paroled after serving six years and is granted three years&#x27; probation; finally a free man, he decides to get a job, but he also immediately breaks one of his parole rules by having sex with a woman who is not his wife. Yet Piri misses Trina and ends up attending a dinner that she is at; he immediately regrets attending after he realizes she wants nothing to do with him. Piri goes back to visit his old building and claims that the mood hasn’t changed one bit. He runs into Carlito who offers him drugs, but Piri tells him he is clean and the memoir ends as he walks out onto the street.

==Themes==
=== Racial Identity ===
Racial identity is a prevalent topic in &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot;. The book tells the story of Piri, a Puerto Rican black man, who has to navigate through a complex system of discrimination and racial prejudice in the USA. Piri’s story portrays the difficulty of navigating through different racial identities. He has a Latino identity because of his Puerto Rican origin. However, he also has a black identity because his physical features relate him directly with the black community. The conflicting positions of both identities forces Piri to make the difficult choice to affirm both identities in the strict black-white binary racial classification formation of the US. Piri struggles in how he should identify himself in order to be accepted by his community. For the most part, he identifies himself only as a Puerto Rican, maybe because his &quot;momma&quot;, who is of Puerto Rican ancestry affirmed this racial origin to Piri since he was a child. 

However, there is also the chance that Piri is aware of the privilege that the Latino heritage has in contrast to the black one. This awareness would have caused Piri to use his Latino ancestry in order to prevent any discrimination that could arise because of his condition as a black man. In the book, there are various scenes where Piri claims his Latino identity in order to prevent further discrimination against him. For instance, when the Italian children were bullying him in the Italian part of Harlem; or when a white girl in his high school asked him about his identity in an almost derogatory way. Also, with Brew, Piri constantly tries to denote his Latin identity over the black one. At the end, however, Piri realizes that “his personal racial identity does not matter when faced up to his physical appearance.”

===Race and gender===
&quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; explores how race and gender intersect and their influence on the life of Piri Thomas. One indication of how this intersection is at play is where Piri embraces the “black macho” persona in an intent to adapt himself to the urban American landscape of New York. In this attempt, Piri appeals to the “hypermasculinized performance of black masculinity as an object of fear and desire.” This means that Piri has a dual sentiment toward the black macho persona. On one side, this archetype is something he rejects since he thinks that by accepting his black identity, he is denying his Puerto Rican heritage. On the other hand, this archetype is also desired by Piri, since this mold is the only one that will permit him to be accepted in the US binary racial culture. Both representations, that Piri either embraces or rejects, come from the very hierarchical racial structure that Piri attempts to navigate.

Another perspective that this memoir permits to analyze in terms of race and gender, is how characters continually struggle against racial oppression at expense of women and queer subjects. The struggle in search of recognition leads not only Piri, but also characters such as his father and Brew, to neglect women and impose chauvinistic attitudes that only hinders more women and queer folks into the hierarchical structure of the United States.
Thomas’ autobiography suggests a kind of heteropatriarchal privilege through the presence of sexual encounters between dominant and subordinate identities. It is paradoxical that while this book shows that, however much Piri enjoys his sexual encounters with women of color, white prostitutes, or queer people of color, those sexual encounters do not affect his internalized racism and sexism. In other words, these sexual contacts do not change Piri&#x27;s mind, or other’s people minds about women, queers and queer people of color. Thomas’ testimonial story positions males as active and females as passive, enabling only to male subjects, to invigorate their masculinity. Piri in &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; is a black heterosexual man, who redirects his struggle against his own racial discrimination and impose it on women and homosexual men. An example of this is how Piri and his black friend, Brew, make women and queer folks their sexual targets.

One key scene is where Piri and his friends go to buy weed from some transvestites. This scene is very ambiguous since it is difficult to say if the transvestites feminize Piri and his friends or vice versa. For instance, it could be argued that transvestites put Piri in a passive position since in this scene they are the clients, while Piri and his friends might be serving the role of prostitutes. The transvestites are the ones that, as a mode of payment, provide liquor and marijuana in exchange for a sexual favor. The response of Piri to this scene is anxiety. Nervous about his feminization, Piri splits his mind from his body, allowing only his body to experience pleasure. On the other hand, in his imagination, he places himself and his friends far from this apartment, at a rooftop party where music, young women and rival gangs occupy the atmosphere.

===Barroom sociology (Chapter 18)===
In Chapter 18, Piri and Brew have an encounter with another black man in a nightclub in Norfolk (the South of the US). This new acquaintance is Gerald Andrew West, a college student from Pennsylvania who is a light-skin African American. Gerald introduces a very interesting topic into the conversation, a topic that for Piri is highly contested (and the reason why he went to the South in the first place). Gerald complains that white people allow him only to be a negro (a black man), but negroes do not allow him to be white. Gerald&#x27;s perception of identity reflects that he sees race as a “burden.” He states that white men and black men have the burden of their own skins, respectively. However, he has the burden of both (white and black) skins. Gerald believes in his “right to identify with whatever race or nationality approximates his emotional feelings and physical characteristics”. On the other hand, Brew, who is a dark-skinned African American from Harlem, represents more the vision of “an angry black nationalist of the 1960s.”

This chapter captures the underlying problem that Piri introduces in the whole book, the search for an identity. Some interpretations can be made with regard to this chapter. For instance, it can be said that Gerald’s research book about Blacks can be understood as the book that Piri himself ends up writing (the memoir of &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot;), which permits Piri to resolve his own identity crisis. In the whole book, Piri struggles between being a Puerto Rican born and raised in New York and being a black man in the eyes of US society. However, his identity crisis is resolved once Piri decides to write his memoir. Similarly, Gerald’s intention to research about the history and lives of black people in the South of the US, could be also seen as a way to reconcile his crisis of identity. In this way, Gerald’s decision to go to the South and research about Blacks would be a metaphor of Piri’s decision to write &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot;.

Another interpretation of Piri’s decision to go to the South, sustains that Piri does so in order to know “what’s shaking” or what is happening down there. His trip to the South would have meant for Piri, an increase in his solidarity sentiment for Afro American people against white supremacy. This trip has also served him to reinforce his resistance toward the white and black binary that obliterates distinctive elements of his identity.

== Literary Devices ==
=== Analogy ===
There is a variety of narrative styles used in &quot;Down These Means Street&quot; and analogy is a significant one. Growing up in Harlem, Thomas witnessed drug dealers in the apartment he lived in, which had an impact on him. He compares the belt his father used to discipline him to the belt the drug dealers used as a tool to help inject drugs into their bodies. It is evident that Thomas had a set of morals, and to the benefit of both responsible parents living with him, he urged to be different. Even when he was influenced by Harlem&#x27;s streets, he remembered his parents&#x27; discipline, which led him back on the right track. &quot;While in prison his parents&#x27; teachings came to mind making him realize that &#x27;a person is born a criminal. 

==Nuyorican literature==
The classification of &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; as one genre rather than another is a point of contention among literary critics—both from the time the autobiographical novel was initially released and in current academic discourse. &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; is a “book claimed by [many] literary traditions, such as U.S. Latin[@] literature or Hispanic literature of the U.S. and Puerto Rican literature written in English.” Anne Garland Mahler of the University of Virginia, on the other hand, classifies &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; as “an autobiography and bildungsroman that chronicles the childhood of Piri Thomas, a Harlem-born son of a Puerto Rican mother and a Cuban father, in Spanish Harlem in the 1940s.” Clearly, &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; fits all of these descriptions, depending on which point of view the critic takes in their analysis.

Most commonly, however, &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; is recognized as part of the Nuyorican literary canon (Nuyorican is a portmanteau of the words ‘New York’ and ‘Puerto Rican’, blending both the Spanish and English rules of orthography—‘nu’ instead of ‘new’ and the suffix ‘-ican’ without a final vowel). Just as Nuyorican, which defines an entire canon of literature from over the past several decades, blends the linguistic rules of Spanish and English, it serves as a representation of multiple cultural traditions. Carmelo Esterrich states that “‘Nuyorican’ writing has always been caught in the critical crossfire between two national spaces—Puerto Rico and the U.S. and between their literary and linguistic borders.” With his brief description of the complexity of the Nuyorican canon, &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot;, however, seems to fit neatly into place. It contains a great many Spanish words surrounded by an English narrative—so many that Thomas includes a glossary for his monolingual readers to uncover their meaning within the bilingual context of the narrative. The context of the origins of Nuyorican literature, Esterrich affirms, stems from “a very specific social and historical context of Puerto Rican migrations to the United States” which resulted in “the literary movement created in New York in the sixties and seventies by Puerto Ricans who were either born in the city or moved there when they were very young.”

The Nuyorican movement is based on a concept of hybridity of Puerto Rican and North American culture. In her analysis of race and gender within Thomas’ book, Marta Sánchez argues that &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; is “a hybrid text of testimonial and imaginative literature” which “initiated the nuyorican stage of continental Puerto Rican writing” to create a “cross-pollinated identity.” Thomas’ narrative includes, as Sánchez observes, “many subjects society stereotypically associates with Latino minorities: poverty, educational failure, gang membership, drug addiction, welfare, petty crime, sexual ‘perversity’, and prison life.” By attributing these stereotypes as themes within his narrative, Thomas establishes the North American context as the setting wherein his Puerto Rican heritage struggles to adapt. Moreover, Sánchez states that Thomas “rejected the paradigms of black or white that dominated the period when &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; was published by generating intercultural linkages among Anglo-Americans, African Americans, and Puerto Ricans years before the concepts of hybridity, heterogeneity, and difference gained academic and social repute.” At the time it was first published, in the late 1960s, the civil rights movement was well underway. However, &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; overlaps the cultural division of Black and White that was the societal norm of the time. Thomas’ narrative tells of experiences that straddled multiple racial and cultural identities: his father was Black and his mother White; his parents were Cuban and Puerto Rican, respectively, which didn’t clearly fit the niches carved out by North American society. As Piri Thomas states in an interview with Ilan Stavans, “[a]lthough I was born in el norte my soul is Puerto Rican.”

&quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; is seen by many scholars to be a foundational work of the Nuyorican literary canon. Thomas has been described as “the best known of his generation of writers and is generally considered the chronicler of the barrio since he was the first to describe his experiences as a second-generation Puerto Rican in the United States.” Indeed, Ilan Stavans notes that &quot;Down These Means Streets&quot; is “now considered a classic and has never been out of print.”

In another interview, with Lisa McGill, Thomas himself admits “I was one of the first Puerto Rican writers in the U.S. to write about the conditions we were living under. Other Puerto Ricans wrote, but they wrote about Puerto Rico and their home. I wrote about what was happening to us—or at least to me—and the surroundings in those years.” Further on, McGill asks Thomas of his opinions on the term ‘Nuyorican’ and how his book has thus been categorised. Thomas replies, saying “I didn’t want to be categorised. With Nuyorican I was given a name. I really wanted to be a citizen of the world. I wanted to be free because all of my life they were putting me in categories”. When asked if he has since become comfortable with this term, he again replies “No, it’s like when you buy a pair of shoes. If you want to wear those shoes, you wear those shoes. Everyone has accepted Nuyorican, so I just go along with it.”

Critic Regina Bernard-Carreño states that “Nuyorican biographies, novels and poetry, spoke directly to [the] misrepresentations of a people and their anti-colonial struggle. An important factor in Puerto Rican immigrant writing and the Nuyorican experience is the articulation of difference and anger [. . .]. Puerto Rican writing exposes anger towards Americanization and assimilation”, just as Thomas does in his book. Bernard-Carreño also asserts that “Nuyorican writing became the genre that included the dynamics of language (bilingualism), bicultural identity (the island vs. the mainland), and the sociopolitics contained therein. While all these dynamics inform Nuyorican writing, language is perhaps one of the critical constructors of the Nuyorican experience and identity…Nuyorican identity became its own culture composed of bicultural and bilingual people.”

==Censorship==
&quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; has either been banned or challenged in Salinas, California; Teaneck, New Jersey; Darien, Connecticut; District 25 in Queens, New York City, New York and in Long Island, New York; the banning of the book by a Long Island school district led to the United States Supreme Court ruling on &quot;Island Trees School District v. Pico&quot; in 1982.

According to Regina Bernard-Carreño, “Piri’s Puerto-Ricanness brought him success and enough of an insider perspective to have his book banned by the New York City Board of Education during the 1960s. Due to its explicit depiction of homosexual and heterosexual acts between and among people of color, who are impoverished and live in a ‘ghetto’ full of drugs and other downfalls, &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; was yanked from junior high school libraries in 1971.” While for modern eyes, &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; provides a raw account of life in El Barrio, at the time of its first publication in the late 1960s, the subject matter of homosexual sex acts and sexual interaction between races was taboo. Bernard-Carreño later explains that Thomas’ book has since been “used as a major ‘classic’ in courses of anthropology and sociology and excerpted in English literature courses as well” and that Thomas’ writing style categorised Puerto Ricans “through a literary and non-traditional academic lens” which was, perhaps, too contemporary for its time of initial publication.

An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 9 May 1971, “Book Ban Splits a Queens School District”, describes a passion-fueled debate at a board meeting of Community School District 25 in a neighborhood in Queens County, New York, which lasted nearly five and a half hours. The article reports that there are some who seem to perceive a threat to their social values, specifically because the portrayal of New York’s Puerto Rican community in &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; includes “vulgarities and descriptions of sexual acts.” One parent at this meeting stated that she felt &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; “is a beautiful book—full of feelings” and that she views the book as “a learning tool [. . .] [t]he author was willing to expose his gut feelings so we could better understand the problems he faced. It promotes understanding.” Another parent, on the other hand, stated that she wanted her children “to have social awareness and I want them to know what they can do to correct social ills. But they are not ready to be exposed to sexual perversion [as depicted in the Thomas book].” Meanwhile, the article presents the position of the United Federation of Teachers, who “fought the ban and has requested the New York Civil Liberties Union to initiate litigation to remove it.”

In an interview, Thomas acknowledges that &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; “was censored all over the place.” Specifically, Thomas mentions Darien, Connecticut where a bond was issued unless the book was removed from library shelves in the town. Thomas continues, stating that the censorship was due to a worry that it “was going to poison the children’s minds.” While speaking at a college in Darien, Thomas said, “Listen, you can’t keep your kids in a greenhouse. This is the reality of what’s happening.”

<doc id="391495" wikidata="Q581891" url="?curid=391495" title="Commando Order">
<text>The Commando Order () was issued by the OKW, the high command of the German Armed Forces, on 18 October 1942. This order stated that all Allied commandos captured in Europe and Africa should be summarily executed without trial, even if in proper uniforms or if they attempted to surrender. Any commando or small group of commandos or a similar unit, agents, and saboteurs not in proper uniforms who fell into the hands of the German forces by some means other than direct combat (by being apprehended by the police in occupied territories, for instance), were to be handed over immediately to the &quot;&quot; (SD, or Security Service) for immediate execution.

According to the OKW, this was to be done in retaliation for their opponents &quot;employing in their conduct of the war, methods which contravene the International Convention of Geneva&quot;. The German high command alleged that they had ascertained from &quot;captured orders&quot; that Allied commandos were &quot;instructed not only to tie up prisoners, but also to kill out-of-hand unarmed captives who they think might prove an encumbrance to them, or hinder them in successfully carrying out their aims&quot;, and that commandos had been ordered to kill prisoners.

This order, which was issued in secret, made it clear that failure to carry out its directives by any commander or officer would be considered an act of negligence punishable under German military law. It was issued on October 18 by Chief of the OKW Wilhelm Keitel, and only a dozen copies were distributed by Chief of Operations Staff Alfred Jodl the next day, with an appendix stating that it was &quot;intended for commanders only, and must not under any circumstances fall into enemy hands&quot;. However it was sent as an Ultra message, intercepted, and translated.

It was in fact the second &quot;Commando Order&quot;, the first being issued by Gerd von Rundstedt on 21 July 1942, stipulating that parachutists should be handed over to the Gestapo. However, it has also been suggested that Hitler had issued secret orders that Allied commandos were to be &quot;shot while trying to escape&quot; as early as October 1941.

Shortly after World War II, at the Nuremberg trials, the Commando Order was found to be a direct breach of the laws of war, and German officers who carried out illegal executions under the Commando Order were found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to death, or, in two cases, extended incarceration.

==Background==

The Commando Order cited alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions by Allied commandos as justification, following incidents at the recent Dieppe Raid and on a small raid on the Channel Island of Sark by the Small Scale Raiding Force, with some men of No. 12 Commando.

===Dieppe Raid ===

On 19 August 1942, during a raid on Dieppe, a Canadian brigadier, William Southam, took a copy of the operational order ashore against explicit orders. The order was subsequently discovered on the beach by the Germans and found its way to Adolf Hitler. Among the dozens of pages of orders was an instruction to &quot;bind prisoners&quot;. The orders were for Canadian forces participating in the raid, and not the commandos. Bodies of shot German prisoners with their hands tied were allegedly found by German forces after the battle.

===Sark Raid===

On the night of 3–4 October 1942, ten men of the Small Scale Raiding Force and No. 12 Commando (attached) made an offensive raid on the German-occupied isle of Sark, called &quot;Operation Basalt&quot;, to reconnoitre the island and to take prisoners.

During the raid, five prisoners were captured. To minimise the task of the guard left with the captives, the commandos tied the prisoners&#x27; hands behind their backs. According to the commandos, one prisoner started shouting to alert his comrades in a hotel and was shot dead. The remaining four prisoners were silenced by stuffing their mouths, according to Anders Lassen, with grass.

En route to the beach, three prisoners made a break. Whether or not some had freed their hands during the escape has never been established, and it is unknown whether all three broke at the same time. One was shot and another stabbed, while the third managed to escape. The fourth was conveyed safely back to England.

===German response and escalation===

A few days after the Sark raid, the Germans issued a communiqué claiming that at least one prisoner had escaped and two were shot while they were escaping, having had their hands tied. They also claimed the &quot;hand-tying&quot; practise was used at Dieppe. Then, on 9 October Berlin announced that 1,376 Allied prisoners (mainly Canadians from Dieppe) would henceforth be shackled. The Canadians responded with a similar-in-practise shackling of German POWs in Canada.

The tit-for-tat shackling continued until the Swiss achieved agreement with the Canadians to desist on 12 December and with the Germans some time later after they received further assurances from the British. However, before the Canadians ended the policy, there was an uprising of German POWs at Bowmanville POW camp.

On 7 October, Hitler personally penned a note in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; daily communiqué:
==Text==
On 18 October, after much deliberation by High Command lawyers, officers, and staff, Hitler issued the Commando Order or in secret, with only 12 copies. The following day Alfred Jodl distributed 22 copies with an appendix stating that the order was &quot;intended for commanders only and must not under any circumstances fall into enemy hands&quot;. The order itself stated:

===Allied casualties===
Dozens of Allied special forces soldiers were executed as the result of this order.

&quot;Commandos&quot; of those types captured were turned over to German security and police forces and transported to concentration camps for execution. The Gazette citation reporting the awarding of the G.C. to Yeo-Thomas describes this process in detail.

POW Allied airmen were also killed via the &quot;Commando Order&quot;.

Victims include:
* The first victims were two officers and five other ranks of Operation Musketoon, who were shot in Sachsenhausen on the morning of 23 October 1942.
* In November 1942, British survivors of Operation Freshman were executed.
* In December 1942, British Royal Marine commandos captured during Operation Frankton were executed under this order. After the captured Royal Marines were executed by a naval firing squad in Bordeaux, the Commander of the German Navy Admiral Erich Raeder wrote in the &quot;Seekriegsleitung&quot; war diary that the executions of the Royal Marines were something &quot;new in international law since the soldiers were wearing uniforms&quot;. American historian Charles Thomas wrote that Raeder&#x27;s remarks about the executions in the &quot;Seekriegsleitung&quot; war diary seemed to be some sort of ironic comment, which might have reflected a bad conscience on the part of Raeder.
* On 30 July 1943, the captured seven-man crew of the Royal Norwegian Navy motor torpedo boat &quot;MTB 345&quot; were executed by the Germans in Bergen, Norway on the basis of the Commando Order.
* In January 1944, British Lt. William A. Millar escaped from Colditz Castle and vanished; it is speculated he was captured and killed in a concentration camp.
* In March 1944, 15 soldiers of the U.S. Army, including two officers, landed on the Italian coast as part of an OSS operation code-named Ginny II. They were captured and executed.
* After the Normandy landings, 34 SAS soldiers and a USAAF pilot were captured during Operation Bulbasket and executed. Most were shot, but three were killed by lethal injection while recovering from wounds in a hospital.
* On 9 August 1944, a U.S. airman POW was killed in Germany; postwar 4 involved were executed; others served prison terms.
* In September 1944, seven British Commandos (along with 40 Dutch members of &quot;Englandspiel&quot;) were executed over two days at KZ Mauthausen.
* On 21 November 1944 U.S. airman and prisoner of war Lt. Americo S. Galle was executed at Enschede, Holland by &quot;SS-Unterscharführer&quot; Herbert Germoth by order of SS General Karl Eberhard Schöngarth.
* On 9 December 1944, five U.S. airmen of the 20th Bombardment Squadron were captured and executed near Kaplitz, Czechoslovakia. Franz Strasser was tried and executed on 10 December 1945 for participating in the murders.
* Between October 1944 and March 1945, nine men of the United States Army Air Forces were summarily executed after being shot down and captured in Jürgen Stroop&#x27;s district. Their known names were Sergeant Willard P. Perry, Sergeant Robert W. Garrison, Private Ray R. Herman, Second Lieutenant William A. Duke, Second Lieutenant Archibald B. Monroe, Private Jimmie R. Heathman, Lieutenant William H. Forman, and Private Robert T. McDonald. When Polish journalist Kazimierz Moczarski reminded him that the killing of POWs was defined as criminal under the Hague and Geneva Conventions, Stroop responded, &quot;It was common knowledge that American flyers were terrorists and murderers who used methods contrary to civilised norms... We were given a statement to that effect from the highest authorities. It was accompanied by an order from Heinrich Himmler.&quot; As a result, he explained, all nine POWs had been taken to the forest and given &quot;a ration of lead for their American necks&quot;.
* On 24 January 1945, nine OSS men, including Lt. Holt Green of the Dawes mission, others of the Houseboat mission, four British SOE agents, and AP war correspondent Joseph Morton, were shot at Mauthausen by &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Georg Bachmayer on orders of Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Morton was the only Allied correspondent to be executed by the Axis during World War II.
* In 1945, Lt. Jack Taylor USNR and the Dupont mission were captured by the men of Gestapo agent Johann Sanitzer. Sanitzer asked the RSHA for instructions on a possible deal that Taylor proposed, but Kaltenbrunner&#x27;s staff reminded him &quot;of Hitler&#x27;s edict that all captured officers attached to foreign missions were to be executed&quot;. Taylor was convicted of espionage, though he claimed to be an ordinary soldier. He was sent to Mauthausen. He survived, barely, but gathered evidence, and was eventually a witness at the Nuremberg trials.
* On 13 February 1945, eight survivors of a B-17 crash 48163 of the 772nd Bombardment Squadron in Austria were captured; four survived the war while four were executed.
* On 20 February 1945, OSS agent Roderick Stephen Hall was murdered by the SS in Bolzano, Italy. In 1946 his murderers, who used the Commando Order as their defence, were executed for the murder of Hall, pilot Charles Parker, SAS officers Roger Littlejohn and David Crowley as well as U.S. airmen George Hammond, Hardy Narron, and Medard Tafoya.

===War crime===
The laws of war in 1942 stated, &quot;it is especially forbidden... to declare that no quarter will be given&quot;. This was established under Article 23 (d) of the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot;. The Geneva Convention of 1929, which Germany had ratified, defined who should be considered a prisoner of war on capture, which included enemy soldiers in proper uniforms, and how they should be treated. Under both the Hague and Geneva Conventions, it was legal to execute &quot;spies and saboteurs&quot; disguised in civilian clothes or uniforms of the enemy. The Germans claimed in paragraph one of their order that they were acting only in retaliation in a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for claimed Allied violation of the Geneva Convention regarding the execution of prisoners and other heinous acts; however, insofar as the Commando Order applied to soldiers in proper uniforms, it was in direct and deliberate violation of both the customary laws of war and Germany&#x27;s treaty obligations.

The execution of Allied commandos without trial was also a violation of Article 30 of the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot;: &quot;A spy taken in the act shall not be punished without previous trial.&quot; That provision includes only soldiers caught behind enemy lines in disguises, and not those wearing proper uniforms. Soldiers in proper uniforms cannot be punished for being lawful combatants and must be treated as prisoners of war upon capture except those disguised in civilian clothes or uniforms of the enemy for military operations behind enemy lines.

The fact that Hitler&#x27;s staff took special measures to keep the order secret, including the limitation of its printing to 12 initial copies, strongly suggests that it was known to be illegal. He also knew the order would be unpopular with the professional military, particularly the part that stated it would stand even if captured commandos were in proper uniforms (in contrast to the usual provision of international law that only commandos disguised in civilian clothes or uniforms of the enemy could be treated as insurgents or spies, as stated in the &quot;Ex parte Quirin&quot;, the Hostages Trial, and the trial of Otto Skorzeny and others). The order included measures designed to force military staff to obey its provisions.

Some German commanders, including Erwin Rommel, had refused to relay the order to their troops since they considered it to be contrary to honourable conduct.

==Aftermath==

German officers who carried out executions under the Commando Order were found guilty of war crimes in postwar tribunals, including at the Nuremberg trials. Many claimed in their defence that they themselves risked execution if they had disobeyed the order, but this was disproved.
* General Anton Dostler, who ordered the execution of 15 U.S. soldiers of the Ginny II operation in Italy, was sentenced to death and executed on 1 December 1945. His defence that he had only relayed superior orders was rejected at trial.
* The Commando Order was one of the specifications in the charge against &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Alfred Jodl, who was convicted and hanged on 16 October 1946.
* Likewise, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel&#x27;s endorsement of the Commando and Commissar Orders was one of the key factors in his conviction for war crimes; for the same reason, his request for a military execution (by firing squad) was denied, and he was instead hanged like Jodl on 16 October 1946.
* Another officer charged with enforcing the Commando Order at Nuremberg was Admiral Erich Raeder. Under cross-examination, Raeder admitted to passing on the Commando Order to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and to enforcing the Commando Order by ordering the summary execution of captured British Royal Marines after the Operation Frankton raid at Bordeaux in December 1942. Raeder testified in his defence that he believed that the Commando Order was a &quot;justified&quot; order, and that the execution of the two Royal Marines was no war crime in his own opinion. The International Military Tribunal did not share Raeder&#x27;s view of the Commando Order, convicted him of war crimes for ordering the executions, and sentenced him to life imprisonment; he was released in 1955 and died in 1960.
* Another war crimes trial was held in Braunschweig, Germany, against &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, Supreme Commander of German forces in Norway from 1940–44. The latter was held responsible, among other things, for invoking the Commando Order against survivors of the unsuccessful British commando raid against the Vemork heavy water plant at Rjukan, Norway in 1942 (Operation Freshman). He was sentenced to death in 1946; the sentence was later commuted to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment, and he was released in 1953 for reasons of health. He died in 1968.
* High-ranking intelligence officer Josef Kieffer was sentenced to death at a court-martial hearing for ordering the executions of five SAS prisoners and hanged in 1947. Two others, Karl Haug and Richard Schnur, were likewise executed for participating in the massacre on Kieffer&#x27;s orders, while &quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Otto Ilgenfritz received fifteen years in prison.

<text>Fifth Business (1970) is a novel by Canadian writer Robertson Davies. 
First published by Macmillan of Canada in 1970, it is the first installment of Davies&#x27; best-known work, the &quot;Deptford Trilogy&quot;, and explores the life of the narrator, Dunstan Ramsay. It was the novel that brought Davies to international attention.

==Plot summary==

Dunstan Ramsay, an aging history teacher at Colborne College, becomes enraged by the patronizing tone of a newspaper article announcing his recent retirement, which appears to portray him as an unremarkable old man with no notable accomplishments to his name. Hoping to prove that he has lived a worthwhile and fulfilling life, Ramsay pens an indignant letter to the school&#x27;s headmaster relating the story of his life, beginning with a childhood memory of an incident that occurred in his hometown of Deptford, Ontario in December 1908.

During a quarrel with a ten-year-old Ramsay (then known as &quot;Dunstable Ramsay&quot;), Ramsay’s wealthy friend Percy Boyd Staunton angrily hurls a snowball at him, but accidentally hits his heavily pregnant neighbor Mary Dempster, causing her to prematurely give birth to a sickly child called &quot;Paul&quot;. Apparently afflicted with severe mental trauma by the incident, Mrs. Dempster&#x27;s behavior grows progressively more erratic until she is ostracized from polite society after being found having sex with a homeless tramp in a gravel pit, leading Paul Dempster to become an outcast in the village. While Ramsay takes pity on Paul and often keeps him company, Staunton refuses to take responsibility for throwing the snowball. The rift between the two deepens after Staunton begins a romantic relationship with Ramsay&#x27;s crush Leola Cruikshank.

When Ramsay&#x27;s gravely injured brother Willie apparently makes a miraculous recovery after Mrs. Dempster prays at his bedside, Ramsay comes to suspect that Mrs. Dempster is capable of performing miracles, which is seemingly confirmed after Ramsay himself has a vision of her shortly before miraculously surviving an artillery blast at the Battle of Ypres in World War I, losing his left leg in the process. Upon awakening in a military hospital from a six-month coma, he learns that he was initially presumed dead and posthumously won a Victoria Cross, and that his parents died from Spanish Influenza before learning that he was still alive. While recovering in the hospital, Ramsay has an affair with nurse Diana Marfleet, but breaks up with her after rejecting her marriage proposal, prompting Diana to playfully nickname him &quot;Dunstan&quot; after the 10th-century English saint who supposedly resisted the temptations of the Devil; this conversation later inspires Ramsay to have his first name legally changed to &quot;Dunstan&quot;. Upon returning to Deptford, he learns that Staunton has become engaged to Leola, while Mrs. Dempster has been taken in by a relative after apparently going insane, and Paul Dempster has run away from home to join the circus.

After becoming a schoolteacher, Ramsay earns a reputation as an eccentric due to his interest in hagiology (the study of saints). Meanwhile, Staunton—now known as &quot;Boy,&quot; shortened from his middle name—becomes a fabulously wealthy businessman. Despite tacitly resenting Boy for his money and status, Ramsay maintains an uneasy friendship with him and Leola, often accepting his financial assistance. Later, Ramsay becomes convinced that Mrs. Dempster is a saint following a chance encounter with Joel Surgeoner—the man who had sex with her in the gravel pit—who miraculously turned his life around after his sexual encounter with her. After successfully tracking Mrs. Dempster to Toronto, Ramsay offers to become her caretaker.

Following the birth of her son David, Leola becomes increasingly unhappy with her marriage to Boy, finding herself unable to adjust to high-society life due to her provincial upbringing. The Stauntons&#x27; marital difficulties culminate in Leola unsuccessfully attempting suicide on Christmas Eve in 1936 after a fight with Boy. When Leola dies of pneumonia a few years later, Ramsay suspects that she intentionally brought about her death by leaving her window open.

Ramsay&#x27;s deepening obsession with hagiology leads him to travel to Europe to meet with the Bollandists (a society of Jesuit scholars who chronicle the lives of saints) after they agree to publish one of his articles. During his trip, he develops a close relationship with elderly Jesuit priest Padre Blazon, who specializes in chronicling the earthly side of saints&#x27; lives, believing that most saints are much more flawed and human than history might choose to remember them. 

While in Mexico City on a six-month sabbatical from Colborne College, Ramsay attends a magic show put on by the mysterious illusionist Magnus Eisengrim, who is revealed to be an adult Paul Dempster. Intrigued by Eisengrim&#x27;s spectacular illusions, Ramsay joins his entourage as he tours the world with his magic act, and gradually becomes close to Eisengrim&#x27;s wealthy patroness Liesl, an eccentric woman with a bizarre androgynous appearance. Liesl, who becomes Ramsay&#x27;s lover, senses that he has never been truly happy, having spent most of his life being overshadowed by other people whose lives have intersected with his own. To help him make sense of his role in the world, Liesl suggests that Ramsay is fated to play the part of &quot;fifth business,&quot; a term for a supporting player in a stage show whose role can’t be easily classified, but nonetheless plays a vital role in resolving the plot.

Ramsay&#x27;s recollections ultimately reach their climax in 1968 after Ramsay and Eisengrim both cross paths with Boy following a show in Toronto. In a tense conversation, Eisengrim reveals his true identity to Boy, and Ramsay tells Eisengrim about the events in December 1908 that led to his premature birth. Recalling the incident, Ramsay states that the snowball that Boy threw at Mrs. Dempster had a rock concealed in it, and claims that he still has the rock. Boy, however, still refuses to admit to throwing the snowball, denying any responsibility for Mrs. Dempster&#x27;s misfortunes. After Boy and Eisengrim storm out of the room, Ramsay finds the rock missing.

Hours later, Boy is found dead in his car after apparently driving into a river, leaving the police unsure whether his death was murder or suicide. Curiously, a stone is found placed in his mouth, which Ramsay believes to be the rock that Boy threw at Mrs. Dempster as a child. Later, while watching a fortune-telling display at Eisengrim&#x27;s magic show, Ramsay collapses from a sudden heart attack after someone in the audience cries out &quot;Who killed Boy Staunton?&quot; Onstage, the fortune-telling &quot;Brazen Head&quot; cryptically replies that he was killed by five people: by himself, by the woman he knew, by the woman he did not know, by the man who granted his inmost wish, and by &quot;the inevitable fifth, who was keeper of his conscience and the keeper of the stone.&quot;

With that, Ramsay concludes the story of his life, saying only, &quot;And that, headmaster, is all I have to tell you.&quot;

==Themes==

Davies discusses several themes in the novel, perhaps the most important being the difference between materialism and spirituality. Davies asserts religion is not necessarily integral to the idea—demonstrated by the corrupt Reverend Leadbeater who reduces the Bible to mere economic terms.

Davies, then an avid student of Carl Jung&#x27;s ideas, deploys them in &quot;Fifth Business&quot;. Characters are clear examples of Jungian archetypes and events demonstrate Jung&#x27;s idea of synchronicity. A stone allegedly thrown at Ramsay when he was a child reappears decades later in a scandalous suicide or murder. Ramsay&#x27;s character is a classic introverted personality, contrasted throughout the book with the extroverted sensuality of Boy Staunton. Ramsay dedicates his life to genuine religious feeling as he saw it in his &#x27;fool-saint&#x27; Mary Dempster, whose son grows up to be the very archetype of the Magician.

Robertson Davies&#x27; interest in psychology has a massive influence on the actions in the book. The prominence of matriarchs in Dunstan&#x27;s life can be linked to Sigmund Freud&#x27;s Oedipus complex (Dunstan loves Diana and Mrs. Dempster, despite their motherly positions in his life). Carl Jung&#x27;s concept of individualisation plays a role when Liesl discusses Dunstan&#x27;s yet-unlived life and the idea that he must have balance in his life. Erik Erikson&#x27;s stages of psychosocial development can also be seen in the choices Boy makes compared to the choices Dunstan makes (e.g. Boy chooses intimacy while Dunstan chooses isolation).

A genuinely learned man, Davies wrote a prose that both poked fun at pretentious scholarship and enjoyed joking allusions, as in the names of Ramsay&#x27;s girl friends, Agnes Day, Gloria Mundy and Libby Doe. He explained these later as &quot;Agnes, the Sufferer – a type well known to all men; Gloria, the Good Time Girl, and Libby, the energetic go-getter&quot;. Agnes Day is a play on the Latin religious phrase agnus Dei, &quot;lamb of God&quot;. Libby Doe is a play on the word &quot;libido&quot;, borrowed from Latin by Freud to mean the inner impulse-driven part of the psyche. Gloria Mundy is a play on the Latin religious phrase &quot;Sic transit gloria mundi&quot;, or &quot;Thus passes the glory of the world.&quot;

===Religion and morality===
There is sectarianism in Deptford dividing the frontier townsfolk between five Christian churches that do not associate with each other under normal circumstances. It takes emergency situations for them to lend aid to each other, but this is conditional aid based on the assumption that certain moral codes will be preserved regardless of faith. For instance, Mary Dempster is a daft-headed girl who habitually flouts the norms of the society, and so she finds herself ostracised and ridiculed by it, evidenced by the fact that no one comes to her aid when her son runs away. However, she is the only member of Deptford society that Dunstan views as truly &#x27;religious&#x27; in her attitude because she lives according to a light that arises from within (which he contrasts with her husband&#x27;s &#x27;deeply religious&#x27; attitude, which &#x27;meant that he imposed religion as he understood it on everything he knew or encountered&#x27; (46)).

As a boy, Dunstable is raised as a Presbyterian, but he also takes an avid interest in Catholic saints. He grows up to develop a more spiritual mode of life that is not reliant on external structures. For Dunstan Ramsay, religion and morality are immediate certainties in life, and the events of the novel show how moral lapses have a way of &#x27;snowballing&#x27; and coming back to haunt one.

===Myth and history===
Davies and Dunstan are at pains to illustrate just how fluid the concept of historical fact really is, and that it is not so distinct from the suppositions of mythic thinking. Dunstan questions the extent that he can provide an accurate account of the events of his childhood or his participation in World War I campaigns, because what he recalls is surely distinct from the &#x27;consensually accepted reality&#x27;.

One aspect of this blurred distinction between myth and history is Ramsay&#x27;s lifelong preoccupation with the lives of the Saints. The fantastic nature of their stories were always grounded in actual events, but their miracles were given attention and focus based on the psychosocial attitudes and needs of the day, so that what the public wanted had a large measure of influence over what became the accepted canon.

===The novel and Davies&#x27; life===

Some readers thought that &quot;Fifth Business&quot; was intended to be semi-autobiographical. Davies projected some of his life experiences (childhood in a small Ontario town, family connections with the social and financial elite) into many of his works. He thought of this novel as &quot;autobiographical, but not as young men do it; it will be rather as Dickens wrote &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; a fictional reworking of some things experienced and much re-arranged.&quot;

Davies allows us to peer through a window into his childhood in Thamesville, Ontario and through his young life into higher education and beyond through the character of Ramsay and the novels of the Deptford trilogy. In &quot;Fifth Business,&quot; Davies provides an account of his spirit, his memories, and his deeper life experiences. Or, as Diane Cole wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot; soon after Davies&#x27; death, &quot;Davies used his personal myths and archetypes to probe the possibilities of human good and evil, but always with a wickedly humorous wink.&quot;

Some of the elements of character Percy Boyd Staunton&#x27;s life resemble that of Davies&#x27; friend Vincent Massey. Both men became rich from their father&#x27;s agricultural businesses. Both men enlisted in World War I, went into politics afterward and held cabinet positions, and strengthened Canada&#x27;s ties with the mother country. Massey was appointed as the first Canada-born Governor General, Boy is likewise appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario. The most convincing parallel is that Boy becomes the chair of the board of Governors which runs the school at which Ramsay teaches, much as Robertson Davies spent his career at the University of Toronto as the Master of Massey College. But the Staunton character is highly fictionalized. Davies has said that aspects of the character are more reflective of his father.

==Title==

Pressured by his publisher to define &quot;Fifth Business,&quot; Davies added this opening quotation. Queried later by the book&#x27;s Norwegian translator Sigmund Hoftun who failed to find the quotation in the (authentic) Danish book, Davies wrote to him 13 August 1979, &quot;it is not from Overskou, because I invented it.&quot;

==Principal characters==
*Dunstan (Dunstable) Ramsay – The protagonist and narrator. Ramsay has been offended by his retirement notice in the &quot;College Chronicle&quot; and intends to prove he has had an interesting life. He served in World War I and received a Victoria Cross. He becomes a scholar of saints and myths, and spends time with Bollandist scholars.
*&#x27;Boy&#x27; (Percy Boyd) Staunton – Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;lifelong friend and enemy&quot; who throws a snowball at him which instead hits Mary Dempster, thereby precipitating the premature birth of Paul Dempster and her subsequent slide into madness. Staunton changes his name from Percy to Boy. A talented businessman and investor, he becomes fabulously wealthy in the sugar-processing business in Canada, eventually owning a conglomerate involved in many different industries (Alpha Corporation). A charming man, he has an immense need for sex.
*Mary Dempster – Ten years older than Ramsay, she plays a pivotal role in his life. She has some saint-like qualities and is held in an insane asylum.
*Paul Dempster – Son of Mary Dempster. Ten years younger than Dunstan Ramsay, he outshines Ramsay in conjuring. He leaves town with a travelling circus. He becomes the magician known as &#x27;Magnus Eisengrim,&#x27; and is the protagonist of &quot;World of Wonders&quot; in this trilogy.
*Diana Marfleet – The nurse who cares for Ramsay after he is wounded during World War I. She is his first sexual partner. Diana introduces him to musicals in England. He refuses to marry her, believing that she has too maternal a role in his life. 
*Leola Staunton (née Cruikshank) – The first love of Ramsay, she marries Boy Staunton. Beautiful but volatile, she cannot live up to her ambitious husband&#x27;s expectations.
*Liselotte (Liesl) Vitzlipützli – Daughter of a millionaire Swiss watchmaker, she assists Magnus Eisengrim in his traveling magic show. She is bisexual, and unusually tall and with large features. She becomes Ramsay&#x27;s confessor, lover, and critic.

<text>Gilukhipa, or more probable &quot;Kilu-Hepa&quot; in Hurrian language, in the Egyptian language &quot;Kirgipa&quot; (fl. early 14th c. BCE), was the daughter of Shuttarna II, king of Mitanni. She was the sister of Tushratta (later King of Mitanni), Biria-Waza and Artashumara.

==Biography==
For political reasons, Gilukhipa was sent to Egypt to join Amenhotep III in marriage. The Egyptian pharaoh made a special issue of commemorative scarabs on the occasion of his marriage to Gilukhipa in his 10th regnal year (ca.1378–1376 BCE), where he recorded that the princess was escorted by 317 ladies-in-waiting, women from the Mitanni king&#x27;s royal palace. Gilukhipa became known as the &quot;Secondary King&#x27;s Wife,&quot; meaning she was secondary to Amenhotep III&#x27;s chief wife, Queen Tiye.

Twenty-six years later, her niece Tadukhepa also became Amenhotep&#x27;s wife.

<doc id="391505" wikidata="Q1146247" url="?curid=391505" title="CICS">
<text>IBM CICS (Customer Information Control System) is a family of mixed-language application servers that provide online transaction management and connectivity for applications on IBM mainframe systems under z/OS and z/VSE.

CICS family products are designed as middleware and support rapid, high-volume online transaction processing. A CICS &quot;transaction&quot; is a unit of processing initiated by a single request that may affect one or more objects. This processing is usually interactive (screen-oriented), but background transactions are possible.

CICS Transaction Server (CICS TS) sits at the head of the CICS family and provides services that extend or replace the functions of the operating system. These services can be more efficient than the generalized operating system services and also simpler for programmers to use, particularly with respect to communication with diverse terminal devices.

Applications developed for CICS may be written in a variety of programming languages and use CICS-supplied language extensions to interact with resources such as files, database connections, terminals, or to invoke functions such as web services. CICS manages the entire transaction such that if for any reason a part of the transaction fails all recoverable changes can be backed out.

While CICS TS has its highest profile among large financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, many Fortune 500 companies and government entities are reported to run CICS. Other, smaller enterprises can also run CICS TS and other CICS family products. CICS can regularly be found behind the scenes in, for example, bank-teller applications, ATM systems, industrial production control systems, insurance applications, and many other types of interactive applications.

Recent CICS TS enhancements include new capabilities to improve the developer experience, including the choice of APIs, frameworks, editors, and build tools, while at the same time providing updates in the key areas of security, resilience, and management. In earlier, recent CICS TS releases, support was provided for Web services and Java, event processing, Atom feeds, and RESTful interfaces.

==History==

CICS was preceded by an earlier, single-threaded transaction processing system, IBM MTCS. An &#x27;MTCS-CICS bridge&#x27; was later developed to allow these transactions to execute under CICS with no change to the original application programs.
IBM&#x27;s Customer Information Control System (CICS) was first developed in conjunction with Michigan Bell in 1966. Ben Riggins was an IBM systems engineer at Virginia Electric Power Co. when he came up with the idea for the online system.

CICS was originally developed in the United States out of the IBM Development Center in Des Plaines, Illinois, beginning in 1966 to address requirements from the public utility industry. The first CICS product was announced in 1968, named &quot;Public Utility Customer Information Control System&quot;, or PU-CICS. It became clear immediately that it had applicability to many other industries, so the Public Utility prefix was dropped with the introduction of the first release of the CICS Program Product on July 8, 1969, not long after IMS database management system.

For the next few years, CICS was developed in Palo Alto and was considered a less important &quot;smaller&quot; product than IMS which IBM then considered more strategic. Customer pressure kept it alive, however. When IBM decided to end development of CICS in 1974 to concentrate on IMS, the CICS development responsibility was picked up by the IBM Hursley site in the United Kingdom, which had just ceased work on the PL/I compiler and so knew many of the same customers as CICS. The core of the development work continues in Hursley today alongside contributions from labs in India, China, Russia, Australia, and the United States.

===Early evolution===
CICS originally only supported a few IBM-brand devices like the 1965 IBM 2741 Selectric (golf ball) typewriter-based terminal. The 1964 IBM 2260 and 1972 IBM 3270 video display terminals were widely used later.

In the early days of IBM mainframes, computer software was free bundled at no extra charge with computer hardware. The OS/360 operating system and application support software like CICS were &quot;open&quot; to IBM customers long before the open-source software initiative. Corporations like Standard Oil of Indiana (Amoco) made major contributions to CICS.

The IBM Des Plaines team tried to add support for popular non-IBM terminals like the ASCII Teletype Model 33 ASR, but the small low-budget software development team could not afford the $100-per-month hardware to test it. IBM executives incorrectly felt that the future would be like the past, with batch processing using traditional punch cards.

IBM reluctantly provided only minimal funding when public utility companies, banks and credit-card companies demanded a cost-effective interactive system (similar to the 1965 IBM Airline Control Program used by the American Airlines Sabre computer reservation system) for high-speed data access-and-update to customer information for their telephone operators (without waiting for overnight batch processing punch card systems).

When CICS was delivered to Amoco with Teletype Model 33 ASR support, it caused the entire OS/360 operating system to crash (including non-CICS application programs). The majority of the CICS Terminal Control Program (TCP the heart of CICS) and part of OS/360 had to be laboriously redesigned and rewritten by Amoco Production Company in Tulsa Oklahoma. It was then given back to IBM for free distribution to others.

In a few years, CICS generated over $60 billion in new hardware revenue for IBM, and became their most-successful mainframe software product.

In 1972, CICS was available in three versions DOS-ENTRY (program number 5736-XX6) for DOS/360 machines with very limited memory, DOS-STANDARD (program number 5736-XX7), for DOS/360 machines with more memory, and OS-STANDARD V2 (program number 5734-XX7) for the larger machines which ran OS/360.

In early 1970, a number of the original developers, including Ben Riggins (the principal architect of the early releases) relocated to California and continued CICS development at IBM&#x27;s Palo Alto Development Center. IBM executives did not recognize value in software as a revenue-generating product until after federal law required software unbundling. In 1980, IBM executives failed to heed Ben Riggins&#x27; strong suggestions that IBM should provide their own EBCDIC-based operating system and integrated-circuit microprocessor chip for use in the IBM Personal Computer as a CICS intelligent terminal (instead of the incompatible Intel chip, and immature ASCII-based Microsoft 1980 DOS).

Because of the limited capacity of even large processors of that era every CICS installation was required to assemble the source code for all of the CICS system modules after completing a process similar to system generation (sysgen), called &quot;CICSGEN&quot;, to establish values for conditional assembly-language statements. This process allowed each customer to exclude support from CICS itself for any feature they did not intend to use, such as device support for terminal types not in use.

CICS owes its early popularity to its relatively efficient implementation when hardware was very expensive, its multi-threaded processing architecture, its relative simplicity for developing terminal-based real-time transaction applications, and many open-source customer contributions, including both debugging and feature enhancement.

===Z notation===
Part of CICS was formalized using the Z notation in the 1980s and 1990s in collaboration with the Oxford University Computing Laboratory, under the leadership of Tony Hoare. This work won a Queen&#x27;s Award for Technological Achievement.

===CICS as a distributed file server===
In 1986, IBM announced CICS support for the record-oriented file services defined by Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDM). This enabled programs on remote, network-connected computers to create, manage, and access files that had previously been available only within the CICS/MVS and CICS/VSE transaction processing environments.

In newer versions of CICS, support for DDM has been removed. Support for the DDM component of CICS z/OS was discontinued at the end of 2003, and was removed from CICS for z/OS in version 5.2 onward. In CICS TS for z/VSE, support for DDM was stabilised at V1.1.1 level, with an announced intention to discontinue it in a future release. In CICS for z/VSE 2.1 onward, CICS/DDM is not supported.

===CICS and the World Wide Web===
CICS Transaction Server first introduced a native HTTP interface in version 1.2, together with a Web Bridge technology for wrapping green-screen terminal-based programs with an HTML facade. CICS Web and Document APIs were enhanced in CICS TS V1.3 to enable web-aware applications to be written to interact more effectively with web browsers.

CICS TS versions 2.1 through 2.3 focused on introducing CORBA and EJB technologies to CICS, offering new ways to integrate CICS assets into distributed application component models. These technologies relied on hosting Java applications in CICS. The Java hosting environment saw numerous improvements over many releases. A multi-threaded JVM resource called the JVMSERVER was introduced during the CICS TS version 4.1 release, this was further enhanced to use 64-bit JVM technology in version 5.1. Version 5.1 also saw the introduction of the WebSphere Liberty profile web-container. Ultimately WebSphere Liberty was fully embedded into CICS Transaction Server in version 5.3. Numerous web facing technologies could be hosted in CICS using Java, this ultimately resulted in the removal of the native CORBA and EJB technologies.

CICS TS V3.1 added a native implementation of the SOAP and WSDL technologies for CICS, together with client side HTTP APIs for outbound communication. These twin technologies enabled easier integration of CICS components with other Enterprise applications, and saw widespread adoption. Tools were included for taking traditional CICS programs written in languages such as COBOL, and converting them into WSDL defined Web Services, with little or no program changes. This technology saw regular enhancements over successive releases of CICS.

CICS TS V4.1 and V4.2 saw further enhancements to web connectivity, including a native implementation of the Atom publishing protocol.

Many of the newer web facing technologies were made available for earlier releases of CICS using delivery models other than a traditional product release. This allowed early adopters to provide constructive feedback that could influence the final design of the integrated technology. Examples include the Soap for CICS technology preview SupportPac for TS V2.2, or the ATOM SupportPac for TS V3.1. This approach was used to introduce JSON support for CICS TS V4.2, a technology that went on to be integrated into CICS TS V5.2.

The JSON technology in CICS is similar to earlier SOAP technology, both of which allowed programs hosted in CICS to be wrapped with a modern facade. The JSON technology was in turn enhanced in z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition, an IBM product for composing JSON APIs that can leverage assets from several mainframe subsystems.

Many partner products have also been used to interact with CICS. Popular examples include using the CICS Transaction Gateway for connecting to CICS from JCA compliant Java application servers, and IBM DataPower appliances for filtering web traffic before it reaches CICS.

Modern versions of CICS provide many ways for both existing and new software assets to be integrated into distributed application flows. CICS assets can be accessed from remote systems, and can access remote systems; user identity and transactional context can be propagated; RESTful APIs can be composed and managed; devices, users and servers can interact with CICS using standards-based technologies; and the IBM WebSphere Liberty environment in CICS promotes the rapid adoption of new technologies.

===MicroCICS===
By January, 1985 a 1969-founded consulting company, having done &quot;massive on-line systems&quot; for Hilton Hotels, FTD Florists, Amtrak, and Budget Rent-a-Car, announced what became &quot;MicroCICS&quot;. The initial focus was the IBM XT/370 and IBM AT/370.

===CICS Family===
Although when CICS is mentioned, people usually mean CICS Transaction Server, the &quot;CICS Family&quot; refers to a portfolio of transaction servers, connectors (called CICS Transaction Gateway) and CICS Tools.

CICS on distributed platforms—not mainframes—is called IBM TXSeries. TXSeries is distributed transaction processing middleware. It supports C, C++, COBOL, Java™ and PL/I applications in cloud environments and traditional data centers. TXSeries is available on AIX, Linux x86, Windows, Solaris, and HP-UX platforms. CICS is also available on other operating systems, notably IBM i and OS/2. The z/OS implementation (i.e., CICS Transaction Server for z/OS) is by far the most popular and significant.

Two versions of CICS were previously available for VM/CMS, but both have since been discontinued. In 1986, IBM released &quot;CICS/CMS&quot;, which was a single-user version of CICS designed for development use, the applications later being transferred to an MVS or DOS/VS system for production execution. Later, in 1988, IBM released &quot;CICS/VM&quot;. CICS/VM was intended for use on the IBM 9370, a low-end mainframe targeted at departmental use; IBM positioned CICS/VM running on departmental or branch office mainframes for use in conjunction with a central mainframe running CICS for MVS.

===CICS Tools===
Provisioning, management and analysis of CICS systems and applications is provided by CICS Tools. This includes performance management as well as deployment and management of CICS resources. In 2015, the four core foundational CICS tools (and the CICS Optimization Solution Pack for z/OS) were updated with the release of CICS Transaction Server for z/OS 5.3. The four core CICS Tools: CICS Interdependency Analyzer for z/OS, CICS Deployment Assistant for z/OS, CICS Performance Analyzer for z/OS and CICS Configuration Manager for z/OS.

===Releases and versions===
CICS Transaction Server for z/OS has used the following release numbers:

==Programming==

===Programming considerations===
Multiple-user interactive-transaction application programs were required to be -reentrant in order to support multiple concurrent transaction threads. A software coding error in one application could block all users from the system. The modular design of CICS reentrant / reusable control programs meant that, with judicious &quot;pruning,&quot; multiple users with multiple applications could be executed on a computer with just 32K of expensive magnetic core physical memory (including the operating system).

Considerable effort was required by CICS application programmers to make their transactions as efficient as possible. A common technique was to limit the size of individual programs to no more than 4,096 bytes, or 4K, so that CICS could easily reuse the memory occupied by any program not currently in use for another program or other application storage needs. When virtual memory was added to versions OS/360 in 1972, the 4K strategy became even more important to reduce paging and thrashing unproductive resource-contention overhead.

The efficiency of compiled high-level COBOL and PL/I language programs left much to be desired. Many CICS application programs continued to be written in assembler language, even after COBOL and PL/I support became available.

With 1960s-and-1970s hardware resources expensive and scarce, a competitive &quot;game&quot; developed among system optimization analysts. When critical path code was identified, a code snippet was passed around from one analyst to another. Each person had to either (a) reduce the number of bytes of code required, or (b) reduce the number of CPU cycles required. Younger analysts learned from what more-experienced mentors did. Eventually, when no one could do (a) or (b), the code was considered optimized, and they moved on to other snippets. Small shops with only one analyst learned CICS optimization very slowly (or not at all).

Because application programs could be shared by many concurrent threads, the use of static variables embedded within a program (or use of operating system memory) was restricted (by convention only).

Unfortunately, many of the &quot;rules&quot; were frequently broken, especially by COBOL programmers who might not understand the internals of their programs or fail to use the necessary restrictive compile time options. This resulted in &quot;non-re-entrant&quot; code that was often unreliable, leading to spurious storage violations and entire CICS system crashes.

Originally, the entire partition, or Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS) region, operated with the same memory protection key including the CICS kernel code. Program corruption and CICS control block corruption was a frequent cause of system downtime. A software error in one application program could overwrite the memory (code or data) of one or all currently running application transactions. Locating the offending application code for complex transient timing errors could be a very-difficult operating-system analyst problem.

These shortcomings persisted for multiple new releases of CICS over a period of more than 20 years, in spite of their severity and the fact that top-quality CICS skills were in high demand and short supply. They were addressed in TS V3.3, V4.1 and V5.2 with the Storage Protection, Transaction Isolation and Subspace features respectively, which utilize operating system hardware features to protect the application code and the data within the same address space even though the applications were not written to be separated. CICS application transactions remain mission-critical for many public utility companies, large banks and other multibillion-dollar financial institutions.

Additionally, it is possible to provide a measure of advance application protection by performing test under control of a monitoring program that also serves to provide Test and Debug features.

===Macro-level programming===
When CICS was first released, it only supported application transaction programs written in IBM 360 Assembler. COBOL and PL/I support were added years later. Because of the initial assembler orientation, requests for CICS services were made using assembler-language macros. For example, the request to read a record from a file were made by a macro call to the &quot;File Control Program&quot; of CICS might look like this:

 DFHFC TYPE=READ,DATASET=myfile,TYPOPER=UPDATE...etc.

This gave rise to the later terminology &quot;Macro-level CICS.&quot;

When high-level language support was added, the macros were retained and the code was converted by a pre-compiler that expanded the macros to their COBOL or PL/I CALL statement equivalents. Thus preparing a HLL application was effectively a &quot;two-stage&quot; compile output from the preprocessor fed into the HLL compiler as input.

COBOL considerations: unlike PL/I, IBM COBOL does not normally provide for the manipulation of pointers (addresses). In order to allow COBOL programmers to access CICS control blocks and dynamic storage the designers resorted to what was essentially a hack. The COBOL &quot;Linkage Section&quot; was normally used for inter-program communication, such as parameter passing. The compiler generates a list of addresses, each called a &quot;Base Locator for Linkage&quot; (BLL) which were set on entry to the called program. The first BLL corresponds to the first item in the Linkage Section and so on. CICS allows the programmer to access and manipulate these by passing the address of the list as the first argument to the program. The BLLs can then be dynamically set, either by CICS or by the application to allow access to the corresponding structure in the Linkage Section.

===Command-level programming===
During the 1980s, IBM at Hursley Park produced a version of CICS that supported what became known as &quot;Command-level CICS&quot; which still supported the older programs but introduced a new API style to application programs.

A typical Command-level call might look like the following:
 EXEC CICS
 SEND MAPSET(&#x27;LOSMATT&#x27;) MAP(&#x27;LOSATT&#x27;)
 END-EXEC
The values given in the SEND MAPSET command correspond to the names used on the first DFHMSD macro in the map definition given below for the MAPSET argument, and the DFHMSI macro for the MAP argument. This is pre-processed by a pre-compile batch translation stage, which converts the embedded commands (EXECs) into call statements to a stub subroutine. So, preparing application programs for later execution still required two stages. It was possible to write &quot;Mixed mode&quot; applications using both Macro-level and Command-level statements.

Initially, at execution time, the command-level commands were converted using a run-time translator, &quot;The EXEC Interface Program&quot;, to the old Macro-level call, which was then executed by the mostly unchanged CICS nucleus programs. But when the CICS Kernel was re-written for TS V3, EXEC CICS became the only way to program CICS applications, as many of the underlying interfaces had changed.

===Run-time conversion===
The Command-level-only CICS introduced in the early 1990s offered some advantages over earlier versions of CICS. However, IBM also dropped support for Macro-level application programs written for earlier versions. This meant that many application programs had to be converted or completely rewritten to use Command-level EXEC commands only.

By this time, there were perhaps millions of programs worldwide that had been in production for decades in many cases. Rewriting them often introduced new bugs without necessarily adding new features. There were a significant number of users who ran CICS V2 application-owning regions (AORs) to continue to run macro code for many years after the change to V3.

It was also possible to execute old Macro-level programs using conversion software such as APT International&#x27;s &quot;Command CICS&quot;.

===New programming styles===
Recent CICS Transaction Server enhancements include support for a number of modern programming styles.

CICS Transaction Server Version 5.6 introduced enhanced support for Java to deliver a cloud-native experience for Java developers. For example, the new CICS Java API (JCICSX) allows easier unit testing using mocking and stubbing approaches, and can be run remotely on the developer&#x27;s local workstation. A set of CICS artifacts on Maven Central enable developers to resolve Java dependencies using popular dependency management tools such as Apache Maven and Gradle. Plug-ins for Maven (cics-bundle-maven) and Gradle (cics-bundle-gradle) are also provided to simplify automated building of CICS bundles, using familiar IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and Visual Studio Code. In addition, Node.js z/OS support is enhanced for version 12, providing faster startup, better default heap limits, updates to the V8 JavaScript engine, etc. Support for Jakarta EE 8 is also included.

CICS TS 5.5 introduced support for IBM SDK for Node.js, providing a full JavaScript runtime, server-side APIs, and libraries to efficiently build high-performance, highly scalable network applications for IBM Z.

CICS Transaction Server Version 2.1 introduced support for Java. CICS Transaction Server Version 2.2 supported the Software Developers Toolkit. CICS provides the same run-time container as IBM&#x27;s WebSphere product family so Java EE applications are portable between CICS and Websphere and there is common tooling for the development and deployment of Java EE applications.

In addition, CICS placed an emphasis on &quot;wrapping&quot; existing application programs inside modern interfaces so that long-established business functions can be incorporated into more modern services. These include WSDL, SOAP and JSON interfaces that wrap legacy code so that a web or mobile application can obtain and update the core business objects without requiring a major rewrite of the back-end functions.

==Transactions==
A CICS transaction is a set of operations that perform a task together. Usually, the majority of transactions are relatively simple tasks such as requesting an inventory list or entering a debit or credit to an account. A primary characteristic of a transaction is that it should be atomic. On IBM Z servers, CICS easily supports thousands of transactions per second, making it a mainstay of enterprise computing.

CICS applications comprise transactions, which can be written in numerous programming languages, including COBOL, PL/I, C, C++, IBM Basic Assembly Language, Rexx, and Java.

Each CICS program is initiated using a transaction identifier. CICS screens are usually sent as a construct called a map, a module created with Basic Mapping Support (BMS) assembler macros or third-party tools. CICS screens may contain text that is highlighted, has different colors, and/or blinks depending on the terminal type used. An example of how a map can be sent through COBOL is given below. The end user inputs data, which is made accessible to the program by receiving a map from CICS.
 EXEC CICS
 RECEIVE MAPSET(&#x27;LOSMATT&#x27;) MAP(&#x27;LOSATT&#x27;) INTO(OUR-MAP)
 END-EXEC.
For technical reasons, the arguments to some command parameters must be quoted and some must not be quoted, depending on what is being referenced. Most programmers will code out of a reference book until they get the &quot;hang&quot; or concept of which arguments are quoted, or they&#x27;ll typically use a &quot;canned template&quot; where they have example code that they just copy and paste, then edit to change the values.

===Example of BMS Map Code===
Basic Mapping Support defines the screen format through assembler macros such as the following. This was assembled to generate both the &quot;physical map set&quot; a load module in a CICS load library and a &quot;symbolic map set&quot; a structure definition or &quot;DSECT&quot; in PL/I, COBOL, assembler, etc. which was copied into the source program.

==Structure==

In the z/OS environment, a CICS installation comprises one or more &quot;regions&quot; (generally referred to as a &quot;CICS Region&quot;), spread across one or more z/OS system images. Although it processes interactive transactions, each CICS region is usually started as a batch processing|batch address space with standard JCL statements: it&#x27;s a job that runs indefinitely until shutdown. Alternatively, each CICS region may be started as a started task. Whether a batch job or a started task, CICS regions may run for days, weeks, or even months before shutting down for maintenance (MVS or CICS). Upon restart a parameter determines if the start should be &quot;Cold&quot; (no recovery) or &quot;Warm&quot;/&quot;Emergency&quot; (using a warm shutdown or restarting from the log after a crash). Cold starts of large CICS regions with many resources can take a long time as all the definitions are re-processed.

Installations are divided into multiple address spaces for a wide variety of reasons, such as:

* application separation,
* function separation,
* avoiding the workload capacity limitations of a single region, or address space, or mainframe instance in the case of a z/OS SysPlex.

A typical installation consists of a number of distinct applications that make up a service. Each service usually has a number of &quot;Terminal-Owning Region&quot; (TORs) that route transactions to multiple &quot;Application-Owning Regions&quot; (AORs), though other topologies are possible. For example, the AORs might not perform File I/O. Instead there would be a &quot;File-Owning Region&quot; (FOR) that performed the File I/O on behalf of transactions in the AOR given that, at the time, a VSAM file could only support recoverable write access from one address space at a time.

But not all CICS applications use VSAM as the primary data source (or historically other single-address-space-at-a-time datastores such as CA Datacom) − many use either IMS/DB or Db2 as the database, and/or MQ as a queue manager. For all these cases, TORs can load-balance transactions to sets of AORs which then directly use the shared databases/queues. CICS supports XA two-phase commit between data stores and so transactions that spanned MQ, VSAM/RLS and Db2, for example, are possible with ACID properties.

CICS supports distributed transactions using SNA LU6.2 protocol between the address spaces which can be running on the same or different clusters. This allows ACID updates of multiple datastores by cooperating distributed applications. In practice there are issues with this if a system or communications failure occurs because the transaction disposition (backout or commit) may be in-doubt if one of the communicating nodes has not recovered. Thus the use of these facilities has never been very widespread.

==Sysplex exploitation==
At the time of CICS ESA V3.2, in the early 1990s, IBM faced the challenge of how to get CICS to exploit the new z/OS Sysplex mainframe line.

The Sysplex was to be based on CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon) rather than the existing ECL (Emitter Coupled Logic) hardware. The cost of scaling the mainframe-unique ECL was much higher than CMOS which was being developed by a &quot;keiretsu&quot; with high-volume use cases such as Sony PlayStation to reduce the unit cost of each generation&#x27;s CPUs. The ECL was also expensive for users to run because the gate drain current produced so much heat that the CPU had to packaged into a special module called a Thermal Conduction Module (TCM) that had inert gas pistons and needed plumbed with high-volume chilled water to be cooled. However, the air-cooled CMOS technology&#x27;s CPU speed initially was much slower than the ECL (notably the boxes available from the mainframe-clone makers Amdahl and Hitachi). This was especially concerning to IBM in the CICS context as almost all the largest mainframe customers were running CICS and for many of them it was the primary mainframe workload.

To achieve the same total transaction throughput on a Sysplex, multiple boxes would need to be used in parallel for each workload. However, a CICS address space, due to its quasi-reentrant application programming model, could not exploit more than about 1.5 processors on one box at the time even with use of MVS sub-tasks. Without enhanced parallelism, customers would tend to move to IBM&#x27;s competitors rather than use Sysplex as they scaled up the CICS workloads. There was considerable debate inside IBM as to whether the right approach would be to break upward compatibility for applications and move to a model like IMS/DC which was fully reentrant, or to extend the approach customers had adopted to more fully exploit a single mainframe&#x27;s power using multi-region operation (MRO).

Eventually the second path was adopted after the CICS user community was consulted. The community vehemently opposed breaking upward compatibility given that they had the prospect of Y2K to contend with at that time and did not see the value in re-writing and testing millions of lines of mainly COBOL, PL/I, or assembler code.

The IBM-recommended structure for CICS on Sysplex was that at least one CICS Terminal Owning Region was placed on each Sysplex node which dispatched transactions to many Application Owning Regions (AORs) spread across the entire Sysplex. If these applications needed to access shared resources they either used a Sysplex-exploiting datastore (such as IBM Db2 or IMS/DB) or concentrated, by function-shipping, the resource requests into singular-per-resource Resource Owing Regions (RORs) including File Owning Regions (FORs) for VSAM and CICS Data Tables, Queue Owning Regions (QORs) for MQ, CICS Transient Data (TD) and CICS Temporary Storage (TS). This preserved compatibility for legacy applications at the expense of operational complexity to configure and manage many CICS regions.

In subsequent releases and versions, CICS was able to exploit new Sysplex-exploiting facilities in VSAM/RLS, MQ for zOS and placed its own Data Tables, TD, and TS resources into the architected shared resource manager for the Sysplex: the Coupling Facility or CF, dispensing with the need for most RORs. The CF provides a mapped view of resources including a shared timebase, buffer pools, locks and counters with hardware messaging assists that made sharing resources across the Sysplex both more efficient than polling and reliable (utilizing a semi-synchronized backup CF for use in case of failure).

By this time, the CMOS line had individual boxes that exceeded the power available by the fastest ECL box with more processors per CPU. When these were coupled together, 32 or more nodes would be able to scale two orders of magnitude greater in total power for a single workload. For example, by 2002, Charles Schwab was running a &quot;MetroPlex&quot; consisting of a redundant pair of mainframe Sysplexes in two locations in Phoenix, AZ, each with 32 nodes driven by one shared CICS/DB/2 workload to support the vast volume of pre-dotcom-bubble web client inquiry requests.

This cheaper, much more scalable CMOS technology base, and the huge investment costs of having to both get to 64-bit addressing and independently produce cloned CF functionality drove the IBM-mainframe clone makers out of the business one by one.

==CICS Recovery/Restart==
The objective of recovery/restart in CICS is to minimize and if possible eliminate damage done to Online System when a failure occurs, so that system and data integrity is maintained. If the CICS region was shut down instead of failing it will perform a &quot;Warm&quot; start exploiting the checkpoint written at shutdown. The CICS region can also be forced to &quot;Cold&quot; start which reloads all definitions and wipes out the log, leaving the resources in whatever state they are in.

Under CICS, following are some of the resources which are considered recoverable. If one wishes these resources to be recoverable then special options must be specified in relevant CICS definitions:

* VSAM files
* CMT CICS-maintained data tables
* Intrapartition TDQ
* Temporary Storage Queue in auxiliary storage
* I/O messages from/to transactions in a VTAM network
* Other database/queuing resources connected to CICS that support XA two-phase commit protocol (like IMS/DB, Db2, VSAM/RLS)

CICS also offers extensive recovery/restart facilities for users to establish their own recovery/restart capability in their CICS system. Commonly used recovery/restart facilities include:

* Dynamic Transaction Backout (DTB)
* Automatic Transaction Restart
* Resource Recovery using System Log
* Resource Recovery using Journal
* System Restart
* Extended Recovery Facility

==Components==
Each CICS region comprises one major task on which every transaction runs, although certain services such as access to IBM Db2 data use other tasks (TCBs). Within a region, transactions are cooperatively multitasked they are expected to be well-behaved and yield the CPU rather than wait. CICS services handle this automatically.

Each unique CICS &quot;Task&quot; or transaction is allocated its own dynamic memory at start-up and subsequent requests for additional memory were handled by a call to the &quot;Storage Control program&quot; (part of the CICS nucleus or &quot;kernel&quot;), which is analogous to an operating system.

A CICS system consists of the online &quot;nucleus&quot;, batch support programs, and applications services.

===Nucleus===
The original CICS nucleus consisted of a number of functional modules written in 370 assembler until V3:
* Task Control Program (KCP)
* Storage Control Program (SCP)
* Program Control Program (PCP)
* Program Interrupt Control Program (PIP)
* Interval Control Program (ICP)
* Dump Control Program (DCP)
* Terminal Control Program (TCP)
* File Control Program (FCP)
* Transient Data Control Program (TDP)
* Temporary Storage Control Program (TSP)

Starting in V3, the CICS nucleus was rewritten into a kernel-and-domain structure using IBM&#x27;s PL/AS language which is compiled into assembler.

The prior structure did not enforce separation of concerns and so had many inter-program dependencies which led to bugs unless exhaustive code analysis was done. The new structure was more modular and so resilient because it was easier to change without impact. The first domains were often built with the name of the prior program but without the trailing &quot;P&quot;. For example, Program Control Domain (DFHPC) or Transient Data Domain (DFHTD). The kernel operated as a switcher for inter-domain requests initially this proved expensive for frequently called domains (such as Trace) but by utilizing PL/AS macros these calls were in-lined without compromising on the separate domain design.

In later versions, completely redesigned domains were added like the Logging Domain DFHLG and Transaction Domain DFHTM that replaced the Journal Control Program (JCP).

===Support programs===
In addition to the online functions CICS has several support programs that run as batch jobs. 
* High-level language (macro) preprocessor
* Command language translator
* Dump utility – prints formatted dumps generated by CICS Dump Management
* Trace utility – formats and prints CICS trace output
* Journal formatting utility prints a formatted dump of the CICS region in case of error

===Applications services===
The following components of CICS support application development.
* Basic Mapping Support (BMS) provides device-independent terminal input and output
* APPC Support that provides LU6.1 and LU6.2 API support for collaborating distributed applications that support two-phase commit
* Data Interchange Program (DIP) provides support for IBM 3770 and IBM 3790 programmable devices
* 2260 Compatibility allows programs written for IBM 2260 display devices to run on 3270 displays
* EXEC Interface Program the stub program that converts calls generated by codice_1 commands to calls to CICS functions
* Built-in Functions – table search, phonetic conversion, field verify, field edit, bit checking, input formatting, weighted retrieval

<doc id="391506" wikidata="Q1710161" url="?curid=391506" title="The &quot;5&quot; Royales">
<text>The &quot;5&quot; Royales was an American rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) vocal group from Winston-Salem, North Carolina that combined gospel, jump blues and doo-wop, marking an early and influential step in the evolution of rock and roll. Most of their big R&amp;B hits were recorded in 1952 and 1953 and written by the guitarist Lowman &quot;Pete&quot; Pauling. 

Cover versions of the band&#x27;s songs hit the Top 40, including &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot; (the Shirelles and the Mamas &amp; the Papas), &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; (Ray Charles and Ike &amp; Tina Turner), and &quot;Think&quot; (James Brown &amp; The Famous Flames). Brown modeled his first vocal group after the &quot;5&quot; Royales, and both Eric Clapton and Stax guitarist Steve Cropper cited Pauling as a key influence. The Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger covered &quot;Think&quot; on his 1993 solo album &quot;Wandering Spirit&quot;.

The &quot;5&quot; Royales were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015.

==History==
Originally the Royal Sons Quintet, the group began recording for Apollo Records in the early 1950s, changing its name to the Royals after abandoning gospel for secular music. The group initially included Lowman Pauling and his brother Clarence, as founding members. Clarence Pauling later shortened his name to &quot;Clarence Paul&quot;. He left the group to become involved with Motown as a producer. Other members included the vocalists Jimmy Moore, Obadiah Carter, and Otto Jeffries, with Johnny Tanner singing lead. Tanner&#x27;s younger brother, Eugene, later replaced Jeffries. The robust Johnny Tanner sang lead on most of the group&#x27;s hits, including &quot;Think,&quot; but the sweeter-voiced Eugene Tanner stepped to the microphone for the group&#x27;s best-known song, &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love.&quot; &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Do It&quot; and &quot;Help Me Somebody&quot; became hits in 1953, and the group soon signed with King Records. In addition to heartfelt odes like &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love,&quot; Pauling also wrote comic and risque tunes, including &quot;Monkey Hips and Rice&quot;, later the title of a two-CD anthology of the group&#x27;s music released by Rhino Records in 1994. Pauling used an extra-long strap for his guitar, sometimes playing it down around his knees for comic effect. The group shared stages with all the major R&amp;B artists of the 1950s, including Sam Cooke and Ray Charles, once substituting for the latter&#x27;s Raelettes at a show in Durham, North Carolina.

According to the Acoustic Music organization, the &quot;first clear evidence of soul music shows up with The &#x27;5&#x27; Royales, an ex-gospel group that turned to R&amp;B&quot;.

Confusion arose when two groups of Royals began touring, the other led by the Detroit R&amp;B star Hank Ballard. According to members of the &quot;5&quot; Royales, the confusion peaked in 1953 when an unscrupulous promoter booked Ballard&#x27;s group in Winston-Salem, trying to pass the Detroit band off as the hometown group with the same name, much to the chagrin of a local audience. Shortly thereafter, the air cleared when Winston-Salem&#x27;s Royals became the &quot;5&quot; Royales and Detroit&#x27;s Royals became The Midnighters. (The &quot;5&quot; was in scare quotes because there were actually six members at the time.) Both groups had hits at King working with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame producer Ralph Bass, becoming good friends and routinely competing in battles of the bands at clubs like the Royal Peacock, in the Sweet Auburn section of Atlanta.

With King, &quot;Think&quot; and &quot;Tears of Joy&quot; became hits for the &quot;5&quot; Royales in 1957. Some of their lesser-known tracks from this period are now critically acclaimed as innovative. Rock critic Dave Marsh chose the 1958 &quot;5&quot; Royales hit &quot;The Slummer the Slum&quot; as one of the top 1001 singles of all time in his book &quot;The Heart of Rock and Soul&quot;, crediting Pauling with capturing the first intentional use of guitar feedback on record, years before better-known squawks from The Beatles, The Yardbirds, and The Velvet Underground. In the 1960s, R&amp;B gradually gave way to more polished soul music and the Royales&#x27; career waned rapidly. The band still recorded, including for Memphis label Home Of The Blues - which results were later compiled on the posthumous &quot;Catch That Teardrop&quot; album - as well as Vee-Jay, ABC-Paramount, Smash Records and the Todd label.

The &quot;5&quot; Royales broke up in 1965, though various combinations of musicians toured under the group&#x27;s name into the 1970s. For a time Pauling continued recording with the pianist and frequent Royales collaborator Royal Abbitt as El Pauling and the Royalton. Pauling&#x27;s brother, Clarence Paul, a former member of the Royal Sons Quintet, found success as a producer and songwriter at Motown Records in the 1960s.

== Post-group ==
After years of struggle with alcohol dependency, Lowman Pauling &quot;(né&quot; Lowman Pete Pauling, Jr.; 1927–1973) ended up working as a night watchman at a Manhattan church and died of an apparent seizure on December 26, 1973. He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Winston-Salem, as were his brother Clarence, who lies next to him, and his bandmates Otto Jeffries (1912–1975), who died on August 8, 1975, and Obadiah Carter &quot;(né&quot; Obadiah Hawthorne Carter; 1925–1994). Health problems forced Eugene Tanner &quot;(né&quot; Eugene Elijah Tanner; 1936–1994) to take disability benefits in the years before his death on December 29, 1994. His brother Johnny Tanner &quot;(né&quot; John Louis Tanner; 1924–2005) died of cancer on November 8, 2005. Jimmy Moore &quot;(aka&quot; Johnny; &quot;né&quot; James Edward Moore; 1926–2008), the last surviving member of The &quot;5&quot; Royales, died on August 16, 2008, at the Cedar Manor Nursing Home in Ossining, New York, after a long illness.

== Legacy ==
The &quot;5&quot; Royales were inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009. They were nominated unsuccessfully for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 and 2004; they were inducted in 2015 in the category Early Influence.

The legacy and influence of the &quot;5&quot; Royales was profiled on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition Sunday&quot; on August 14, 2011, in an interview with the guitarist Steve Cropper. Cropper released the album &quot;Dedicated: A Salute to the 5 Royales&quot; in 2011.

In May 2015, compilation &quot;Soul &amp; Swagger: The Complete &quot;5&quot; Royales 1951-1967&quot; won a Blues Music Award in the Historical category. Other posthumous compilations include &quot;Monkey Hips and Rice: The &quot;5&quot; Royales Anthology&quot; (1994), &quot;The Apollo Sessions&quot; (1995), &quot;It&#x27;s Hard But It&#x27;s Fair: King Hits and Rarities&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Definitive &quot;5&quot; Royales: Home of the Blues &amp; Beyond&quot; (2014).

<text>The University of Georgia School of Law (Georgia Law) is the law school of the University of Georgia, a public research university in Athens, Georgia. It was founded in 1859, making it one of the oldest American university law schools in continuous operation. Georgia Law accepted 14.77% of applicants for the class entering in 2023.

Georgia Law recent graduates include 11 governors, over 110 state and federal legislators, approximately 70 federal judges, and numerous state supreme court justices, practitioners, government officials, ambassadors, trial court judges, academics and law firm principals. Notable recent alumni of Georgia Law include former acting United States Attorney General Sally Yates, former President Pro Tempore of the U.S. Senate Richard B. Russell Jr., former Chief Judge and present Senior Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals Larry Edmondson, and Ertharin Cousin, named to the &quot;TIME&quot; 100 most influential people in the world list and Payne Distinguished Professor at Stanford University&#x27;s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

==History==
The law school was founded in 1859. The founding three professors of the university&#x27;s new law school included one of the United States&#x27; first state supreme court chief justices, Joseph Lumpkin, a Princeton alumnus. Joining him was attorney Thomas Cobb, who was the author of first enacted comprehensive codification of common law in the United States. The third original law professor was William Hull, an honors graduate of the University of Georgia, who had been a United States Attorney and a Solicitor General of the United States. Previously, law courses had been offered as part of the undergraduate curriculum of Franklin College of the university. The first classes of the Lumpkin Law School, as it was originally designated, were held at the law offices of Lumpkin and Cobb at the corner of Prince Avenue and Pulaski Street until 1873.

By 1880, the curriculum included courses in equity, parliamentary law, and various commercial law studies such as partnership, insurance, tax, and tariffs. Around 1889, stricter admission standards mandated that students be at least 18 years old. Two years later, an entrance exam had been instituted. The modern method of case law instruction was ushered in during the 1920s. In December 1931, the school was granted membership in the Association of American Law Schools. After being housed in various buildings over the years, the law school in 1932 moved into the new Hirsch Hall, named in honor of prominent attorney Harold Hirsch, located on historic North Campus at the University of Georgia.

Hirsch Hall, expanded by many thousands of square feet over the years in connected buildings and upgrades, remains the site of law school classrooms and offices, as well as the Alexander Campbell King Law Library and the Hatton Lovejoy Courtroom. A 2012 renovation created almost 4,000 square feet of additional space, including a cafe and enclosed three story courtyard.

The law school&#x27;s four-story, 40,000-square-foot separate addition, Dean Rusk Hall, opened in 1996 adjacent to Hirsch Hall. Named for former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who was a Georgia Law professor, this building became the new home of the Dean Rusk International Law Center, founded in 1977. Dean Rusk Hall also houses additional classrooms, faculty offices, and library space, and a second law school courtroom, the James E. Butler Courtroom.

In the three years up to 2020, the Law School raised an additional $61 million to add to its endowment for scholarships, teaching, clinics, and experiential offerings. In 2024, the Law School received an additional $5 million donation from the Stanton Foundation.

==Academics==
More than 300 courses, clinics, and seminars are offered at Georgia Law, including business-related law, property-related law, personal rights and public interest law, trial and appellate practice, as well as global practice preparation. Although academics, theory, and legal reasoning are primary, Georgia Law is also ranked A+ and 16th of all ABA law schools for practical training. Ninety-four percent of students participate in clinics and externships. 

Degrees awarded include the Juris Doctor (J.D.), the Master of Laws (LL.M.) for foreign-trained lawyers, and the Master in the Study of Law (M.S.L.) for those who do not want to practice law, but wish to gain an understanding of legal principles and perspectives in order to advance their careers. Students also may choose to pursue interdisciplinary coursework in other University schools and colleges, or to earn one of many dual degrees including a J.D./M.B.A. or LL.M./M.B.A.

The law school is accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA), is a member of the Association of American Law Schools, has a chapter of the Order of the Coif, and is host to two advocacy inns: Lumpkin Inn of Court, one of the earliest American inns of court, and E. Wycliffe Orr Sr. American Inn of Court. Both are modeled after the English inns of court. It is also an academic partner of the American Society of International Law.

===Admissions===
The law school is among the most selective law schools in the nation, Georgia Law accepting 14.77% of applicants for the Class entering in 2023, with that class having an &quot;average&quot; LSAT score of 169 and &quot;average&quot; undergraduate GPA of 3.83. Georgia Law&#x27;s 2022 &quot;average&quot; selectivity rating was 96 out of a possible maximum of 99, Georgia Law enrolled students being in the top 3% of law school applicants. Approximately 27% of enrolled students self-identify as belonging to historically underrepresented groups. Although grades, degrees earned, and standardized test scores are important, for each applicant the admissions committee primarily considers a mandatory personal admission essay, a mandatory resume detailing the applicant&#x27;s education, employment, fellowships, skills, honors, awards, community involvement, volunteer work, and other accomplishments, as well as mandatory letters of recommendation.

The 165 students entering in 2023 came from 26 states, 15 countries, and 59 undergraduate institutions. Of those students, 73% received merit based scholarships and 92% received some form of financial aid.

===Student support and faculty to student ratio===
Georgia Law&#x27;s Mentorship Program matches every law student with a faculty member mentor, an upperclassman peer mentor, a Career Development Office counselor, and an alumnus professional mentor. 
There are just six students for each faculty member. 

===Rankings===
For the 2022 &quot;Top 50 Law School Rankings,&quot; of the 196 ABA-approved law schools, Georgia Law was ranked #13. However, according to the study by Law School Transparency, Georgia Law ranked in the top ten nationally for employment outcomes, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; recognized Georgia law as being in the top five law schools offering the best salary-to-debt ratios in the nation. Furthermore, the law school has been ranked #13 of the top best law schools by &quot;the National Jurist&quot; as well as by Above the Law. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s&quot; 2024 ranking of #20 places Georgia Law in the top tier of all 196 ABA-approved law schools and in the top 10% of those schools, with the school additionally individually ranked in Trial Advocacy, Business/Corporate Law, Clinical Training, Constitutional Law, Contracts/Commercial Law, Dispute Resolution, Environmental Law, Intellectual Property Law, International Law, Healthcare Law, Legal Writing, and Tax Law. Finally, based on outcome-driven factors such as average indebtedness, bar passage, and employment, Georgia Law has been ranked #1 as the best value in legal education in the United States by &quot;the National Jurist&quot; since 2019 for five years.

==Law review and journals==
Georgia Law students publish four legal journals: 
Georgia Law Review 
Journal of Intellectual Property Law 
Georgia Journal of International and Comparative Law 
Georgia Criminal Law Review. 
These journals have frequently been cited by federal and state courts, as well as textbooks and law reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.law.uga.edu/journals&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Membership on the journals is limited to students in their second and third years of law school. In addition to the Georgia Law Review, students publish the online component, the Georgia Law Review Posts, which features essays by students, practitioners, judges, and professors focused primarily on timely legal issues in the U.S. Supreme Court and U.S. courts of appeals.

==Alexander Campbell King Law Library==

The Alexander Campbell King Law Library is the oldest and largest law library in the state of Georgia. In 1967, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black gave the keynote address at an outdoor ceremony to dedicate a modern law library building adjacent to Hirsch Hall. Housing a collection of more than 500,000 digital and print titles, the law library is a founding member of the Legal Information Preservation Alliance and the Law Library Microform Consortium. It has been designated a Federal Depository Library. The library is also one of the United States&#x27; Specialized European Documentation Centres, houses the Faculty Writings Collection, the Phillips Nuremberg Trials Collection, the Rare Book Collection, and the J. Alton Hosch Collection, which includes the extensive personal library of Dean Hosch, a member of the law school faculty from 1935 to 1964.

The Louis B. Sohn Library on International Relations is housed within the school&#x27;s Dean Rusk International Law Center. The Sohn library is the extensive international law collection of Louis B. Sohn, who was the Woodruff Chair professor at Georgia Law and previously the Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard Law School.

==Clinics and related initiatives==

Students in the Appellate Litigation Clinic have briefed and argued before the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Ninth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits (with students winning five times in four courts in 2020–2021). The Global Externship initiative provides global practice preparation for many students each summer, for instance past practice preparation included, without limitation, placement with law firms like DLA Piper in Russia, GÖRG Partnerschaft von Rechtsanwälten mbB in Germany, Priti Suri &amp; Associates (PSA) in India, Siqueira Castro Advogados in Brazil, and King &amp; Wood Mallesons in China. To educate students in the benefits of public service and the functioning of the judiciary, up to 20 jurists, including U.S. Supreme Court justices, U.S. Court of Appeals judges, and trial judges, visit Georgia Law to teach classes.

==Costs==
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks Georgia Law as having the lowest tuition of the top 20 law schools. The total of tuition and fees for one year at Georgia Law is $18,994 for Georgia residents and $37,752 for non-residents. The total cost of attendance (including the cost of tuition, fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses) for the 2022–23 academic year is estimated to be $36,694 for Georgia residents living on-campus, $39,860 for Georgia residents living off-campus, $56,286 for non-residents living on-campus, and $59,452 for non-residents living off-campus. Non-resident students are able to obtain Georgia residency at the beginning of their second year of law school, and besides other scholarships, available are tuition reduction scholarships that allow non-residents to pay resident tuition for one or two semesters of the first year of Georgia Law. Further, over 73% of the members of the class matriculating in 2024 received merit based scholarships funded by donors, 92% of students received some form of financial aid, and 50% of students did not need to borrow at all for their education. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Georgia Law as a top five law school in having the 4th best salary to debt ratio, while Georgia Law has been ranked #1 as the best value in legal education in the United States by &quot;the National Jurist&quot; since 2019 for five years.

Living Georgia Law graduates work in all 50 states and more than 60 countries. Those who graduated in 2021 are working in 26 states and abroad. According to ABA required disclosures, &quot;not including&quot; those choosing to open their own practices, to pursue additional education, etc., 98% of the 2022 graduating class were hired to perform high-value jobs within nine months after graduation, and 94.79% held full-time, long-term, JD-required positions at that point (Georgia Law being the nation&#x27;s #1 law school for high-value jobs out of 196 ABA-approved schools). For the class graduating in 2022, Georgia Law was ranked in the top four of all 196 ABA approved law schools for the highest percentage of graduates obtaining full-time legal jobs requiring bar passage. Georgia Law was among the top law schools that sent the highest percentage of juris doctor graduates into associate positions at the largest 100 law firms in the country. Of 202 students who graduated in 2021 - &quot;not including&quot; those who opened their own practices, pursued additional education, etc. - 57 went to law firms with up to 50 attorneys, 54 to law firms with 51 to over 500 attorneys including 25 to law firms of over 500 attorneys, 5 to business organizations, 38 to government and public interest organizations (not including judicial clerkships that 38 graduates obtained) and six to academia.

Serving as a judicial clerk is considered one of the most prestigious positions in legal circles, and often opens up wide-ranging opportunities in private practice, high-ranking government work, and academia. Georgia Law has had six alumni serve as judicial clerks for justices of the United States Supreme Court since 2005. Based on the 2005-2021 graduating classes, the School of Law was ranked 14th among the nation&#x27;s law schools for sending its graduates to clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court.

The &quot;Advanced Series 300&quot; was announced at the September 1984 Farnborough Airshow, targeting a 10% cost reduction with more efficient engines and of additional range. Northwest Airlines became the first customer with an order for 10 aircraft on October 22, 1985. The first 747-400 was rolled out on January 26, 1988, and made its maiden flight on April 29, 1988. Type certification was received on January 9, 1989, and it entered service with Northwest on February 9, 1989.
It retains the 747 airframe, including the 747-300 stretched upper deck, with winglets. The 747-400 offers a choice of improved turbofans: the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, General Electric CF6-80C2 or Rolls-Royce RB211-524G/H. Its two-crew glass cockpit dispenses with the need for a flight engineer. It typically accommodates 416 passengers in a three-class layout over a range with its maximum takeoff weight (MTOW).
The first -400M combi was rolled out in June 1989. The -400D Domestic for the Japanese market, without winglets, entered service on October 22, 1991. The -400F cargo variant, without the stretched upper deck, was first delivered in May 1993. With an increased MTOW of , the extended range version entered service in October 2002 as the -400ERF freighter and the -400ER passenger version the following month. Several 747-400 aircraft have undergone freighter conversion or other modifications to serve as transports of heads of state, YAL-1 laser testbed, engine testbed or the &quot;Spirit of Mojave&quot; air launcher. The Dreamlifter is an outsize cargo conversion designed to move Dreamliner components.
With 694 delivered over the course of 20 years from 1989 to 2009, it was the best-selling 747 variant. Its closest competitors were the smaller McDonnell Douglas MD-11 trijet and Airbus A340 quadjet. It has been superseded by the stretched and improved Boeing 747-8, introduced in October 2011. Beginning the late 2010s, 747-400 passenger aircraft began being phased out by airlines in favor of long-range, wide-body twinjet aircraft, such as the Boeing 777 and Airbus A350.

==Development==

===Background===
Following its introduction in 1969, the Boeing 747 became a major success with airlines and the flying public. As the world&#x27;s first wide-body jetliner, the 747 had revolutionized air travel, and cemented its manufacturer&#x27;s dominance in the passenger aircraft market. In 1980, Boeing announced the 747-300, its latest 747 variant featuring greater passenger capacity. This was made possible by making a stretched upper deck (SUD), previously an option on the 747-200, a standard feature. The SUD was almost twice as long as the original 747 upper deck. Besides increased capacity, the 747-300 did not offer any increase in range, nor did it include improvements in flight deck technology or construction materials. At the same time, 747s were becoming more costly to operate due to a number of factors, notably conventional flight control systems, three-person flight crews, and fuel costs.

In 1982, Boeing introduced a two-crew glass cockpit, new engines, and advanced materials on its 757 and 767 twinjets. At the same time, combined sales of the 747-100, −200, −300, and 747SP models (collectively referred to as the 747 &quot;Classics&quot;) exceeded 700, but new orders slowed precipitously. The introduction of the 747-300 did little to stem the decline, and itself faced potential competition from more modern designs. As a result, Boeing began considering a more significant upgrade for its largest passenger jet.

By early 1984, company officials had identified five development objectives for the latest 747 upgrade: new technologies, an enhanced interior, a range increase, more efficient engines, and a 10 percent reduction in operating cost. In September 1984, Boeing announced development of the newest 747 derivative, the &quot;Advanced Series 300&quot;, at the Farnborough Airshow. On October 22, 1985, the type was officially launched when Northwest Airlines became the first 747-400 customer, with an order for 10 aircraft. Cathay Pacific, KLM, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, and British Airways also announced orders several months later, followed by United Airlines, Air France, Malaysia Airlines and Japan Airlines.

===Design effort===

Seven early customers, namely British Airways, Cathay Pacific, KLM, Lufthansa, Northwest, Qantas and Singapore Airlines, formed a consultative group to advise Boeing on the 747-400&#x27;s design process. While the aircraft was planned as a new-technology upgrade, Boeing originally proposed minimal design changes in order to reduce development cost and retain commonality with existing models. The airline consultative group sought more advanced changes, including a two-crew glass cockpit. As a result of airline input, the 747-400&#x27;s new digital cockpit design featured cathode-ray tube (CRT) display technologies first employed on the 757 and 767. The autopilot was also changed to that of the 757 and 767; on the 747-400 a software update was added to allow an &#x27;altitude intervention&#x27; mode.
The 747-400&#x27;s wingspan was stretched by over the Classic 747 through wingtip extensions. For reduced aerodynamic drag, the wings were fitted with tall winglets. Despite the added length, the wings were lighter as a result of new aluminum alloys. The horizontal tail was also redesigned to fit a fuel tank, resulting in a range increase, and the rudder travel was increased to 30 degrees. The landing gear was redesigned with larger wheels and carbon brakes. Internal changes further included a restyled cabin with new materials and updated fittings.

New engines offered on the 747-400 included the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4056, the General Electric CF6-80C2B1F, and the Rolls-Royce RB211-524G/H. The engines offered lower fuel consumption and greater thrust, along with a full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) which adjusted engine performance for improved efficiency compared with the Classic 747s. A new auxiliary power unit (APU) manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada was also selected to provide on-ground power for the 747-400, with a 40 percent reduction in fuel consumption compared to previous APU designs.

===Production and testing===

Final assembly of the first 747-400 began at Boeing&#x27;s Everett factory, the longtime site of 747 production, in September 1987. More than fifty percent of the aircraft was produced by subcontractors, with major structures, engine nacelles, and sub-assemblies supplied by Northrop, and upper deck fuselage frames from Daewoo. All components were integrated during the final assembly process at the Everett factory. The first aircraft, equipped with PW4056 engines, was completed over the winter months of late 1987. On January 26, 1988, the first 747-400 rolled out at the Everett factory, while the first 737-400 rolled out at Boeing&#x27;s Renton factory on the same day, marking the first double jetliner rollout in the manufacturer&#x27;s history. By the time of the rollout, the 747-400 program had amassed more than 100 orders.
The 747-400 flew for the first time on April 29, 1988, under the command of test pilot James Loesch and co-pilot Kenneth Higgins. The first flight was six weeks behind schedule, owing to subcontractor delays in supplying components, and extra troubleshooting on the aircraft&#x27;s electronics systems. The maiden flight took off from Paine Field, site of the Everett factory, and landed at Boeing Field, south of Seattle, after an uneventful 2 hours and 26 minutes. The 747-400&#x27;s flight test program used the first four aircraft built, one more than the minimum number necessary to certify the aircraft&#x27;s three engine options. One test aircraft each was fitted with the CF6-80C2B1F and RB211-524G/H engines, while the other two featured PW4056 engines, with the fourth aircraft serving as a backup. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification was received on January 9, 1989, with Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 engines, May 18, 1989, with General Electric CF6-80C2s and June 8, 1989, with Rolls-Royce RB211-524Gs.

As the flight test program proceeded, Boeing encountered problems in the 747-400&#x27;s production process, leading it to disclose delivery delays of up to one month for the first 20 aircraft built. A primary reason for the delays was the unprecedented complexity of interior configurations offered to airlines, which ranged from lavatory and galley locations to the color shades of cabin warning labels. Coupled with new, relatively inexperienced workers, a lack of veteran technicians, interior configurations needing costly re-work, and teething problems with electronics integration on the advanced flight deck, 747-400 production fell behind schedule. The company managed to resolve early production issues by mid-1989, with the first example airframes of all three engine variants delivered within four months of each other, and overall delays not exceeding several weeks.

==Service entry and operations==
The first 747-400 (N661US) was delivered to launch customer Northwest Airlines. This jet became known for an incident on Northwest Flight 85 caused by a rudder hardover. N661US was later sold to Delta Airlines when Northwest merged with it. N661US later became preserved at the Delta Flight Museum. This was the twentieth anniversary of the 747-100&#x27;s first flight. On May 31, 1989, Singapore Airlines operated the first international service using a 747-400, on a flight from Singapore to London.

In May 1989, one week before the initial delivery to the 747-400&#x27;s first European customer, KLM, the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) shocked Boeing by refusing to grant regulatory certification for the aircraft, citing the upper deck cabin floor&#x27;s resistance to collapse in the event of a sudden decompression. While the manufacturer asserted that the 747-400&#x27;s cabin floor was no different from the already-certified and in-service 747-300, the JAA maintained that the newer model would have a service life into 2020 and beyond and was thus subject to a newer, more stringent standard which had been updated to reflect the risk of explosive devices. In the days leading up to the first delivery to KLM, negotiations between Boeing, the FAA, and the JAA resulted in a compromise: a temporary operating certificate would be issued for the 747-400, provided that the manufacturer develop a structural retrofit for the aircraft within two years. The last-minute deal allowed KLM and Lufthansa to take delivery of their 747-400s without further delays.

After the first 747-400 deliveries, Boeing began production on more variants of the aircraft. The first 747-400 Combi, able to carry both passengers and freight, was rolled out in June 1989. The 747-400 Domestic, a short-range variant of the aircraft designed for Japanese intra-island services, first flew on March 18, 1991, and entered service with Japan Airlines on October 22, 1991. A cargo variant, the 747-400F, was first delivered in May 1993 to Cargolux. By the end of the 1990s, Boeing was producing four versions of the 747-400.

===Further developments===

The extended range freighter (ERF) entered service in October 2002. The next month, the extended range (ER) passenger version entered service with Qantas, the only airline ever to order the passenger version of the 747-400ER. Qantas initially used the 747-400ER for the Melbourne to Los Angeles and Dallas to Sydney route allowing the completion of the flight with full passenger load and cargo. Prior to the 747-400ER, Qantas would complete such flights by blocking out &#x27;E&#x27; zone of the cabin and limiting passenger numbers and cargo. The 747-400ER featured the &quot;Boeing Signature Interior&quot;, which was later made available on the 747-400 (either as a retrofit on existing 747-400s or factory installation on new frames).

The 747-400ER also introduced some flight deck enhancements, including liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), which replaced the six cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays found on the Boeing 747-400. LCDs later became standard on the 747-400 as well, and could be retrofitted to earlier aircraft. The three standby flight displays found on the 747-400 were also replaced by a single combined LCD, the integrated standby flight display (ISFD), which also became standard on the 747-400 in late 2003.

In the 2000s, as part of an effort to promote sustainable and alternative fuel development, as well as lower emissions, several 747-400 operators studied the use of oil extracted from the jatropha plant. Air New Zealand carried out the first commercial flight using jatropha oil for fuel; the airline&#x27;s 747-400 had one engine burning a mix of 50% jatropha oil and 50% jet fuel for two hours during the flight while engineers collected data. Continental Airlines tested jatropha oil in one of its airliners on January 7, 2009. Jatropha is easy to grow, needs little fertilizer or water, and produces an oil-rich plant.

Production of the 747-400 passenger version officially ceased on March 15, 2007. The last four -400s on order were cancelled by Philippine Airlines (which switched to the 777-300ER). The last to order the -400 was China Airlines in November 2002, with the last passenger 747-400 constructed in 2005 and delivered in April of that year. It was the 1358th 747 (MSN33737/B-18215). The last 747-400 was a -400ERF delivered on December 22, 2009, to Kalitta Air.

===Retirement and economic value===
The 747-400&#x27;s leasing, resale and salvage value has dropped steeply since the 2010s. By that time many 747-400s were also more than 20 years old so airlines have accelerated their retirement. The 747, alongside the smaller Airbus A340 and MD-11, each have more than two engines making them relatively expensive to operate, although their main appeal during the early 1990s was their long range as well as high capacity, before the development of wide-body twin-engine aircraft that could achieve similar range and payload while also providing better fuel economy. Such medium/large twinjets like the Boeing 777, Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and Airbus A350 XWB have entered service since the late 1990s onward, and these have taken over routes previously flown by 747-400s, as reducing capacity improved load factors. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets (very large aircraft (VLA) with more than 400 seats) like the 747 and Airbus A380. Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas that plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s did not order the updated 747-8 but instead opted for the Airbus A380. 

For example, Delta Air Lines reduced the number of flights it operated from the United States to Narita International Airport that were intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia, switching to twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Total capacity was cut, but load factors improved. In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400s and replace them either with Airbus A330 or Airbus A350 aircraft (both of which are twinjets). Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased maintenance required of a four-engine aircraft led to a drag on profits.

Since the cost of replacing a 747-400 is high (an airline must purchase or lease another wide-body), some operators choose to fly the 747-400 to the conclusion of its accepted useful life and then scrap it. The current parts resale value for this aircraft has been reduced to its engines. When a 26-year-old 747-400 owned by Delta flew through a violent hailstorm, the company indicated it was likely the aircraft would be scrapped. George Dimitroff, head of valuations for FlightGlobal, estimated the aircraft&#x27;s value before the incident at about $8 million. He noted that this was not the same as its insured value. As discussed in the section on 747-400 converted freighters, there is no longer a viable economic model for converting retired passenger 747-400 aircraft into dedicated freighters, so most retired passenger aircraft will likely be scrapped.

Several airlines have retired their 747-400s from the trans-pacific market. Remaining operators in 2014 included EVA Air, Qantas, Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and United Airlines. United&#x27;s deployment of them also reflected a change in emphasis from Asian hubs to domestic hubs. On January 11, 2017, United announced it would begin phasing out its 747-400s and made its last 747 flight on November 7 that year. Delta Airlines was the last US airline to operate the Boeing 747, retiring the last of the 747-400 fleet it inherited from Northwest Airlines in December 2017.

====Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic====
Prior to COVID-19, British Airways, the largest passenger 747-400 operator then, announced that they would phase out their 747-400 fleet in February 2024, replacing it with the Airbus A350-1000. Lufthansa was to retire their 747-400 fleet in 2025 as they were to be replaced by the Boeing 777x and the Boeing 747-8i. KLM planned to retire their 747-400 Combi and Passenger fleet in 2020 as they were being replaced by the Boeing 777-300ER, the Boeing 787-10, and the Airbus A350-900. However, KLM retired the 747 from passenger service on October 25, 2020.

The global COVID-19 pandemic hastened the retirement of many remaining passenger Boeing 747-400s due to a sharp decline in passenger traffic. For instance, KLM retired its Boeing 747-400 Combi and Passenger fleets in March 2020. Qantas announced the retirement of its 747-400 and 747-400ER fleet by the end of 2020, with the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner taking its place. China Airlines also announced that they would be retiring their remaining four passenger Boeing 747-400s by the end of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic (which were delivered between 2004 and 2005, operating on flights within Asia), with the Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 777-300ER taking over all high-volume routes and all Asian International routes. However, China Airlines didn&#x27;t retire its last passenger Boeing 747-400 until February 2021. British Airways retired its remaining 31 Boeing 747-400s 4 years ahead of the original February 2024 deadline. Virgin Atlantic also retired their remaining leisure fleet 747-400s in May 2020 citing the COVID-19 pandemic - the fleet was due to retire in 2021. As of September, 2021, there were just 42 passenger 747-400 in operation (10 actively flying, 32 in storage) across 10 carriers worldwide.

On 29 April 2022, Air India retired its remaining 747-400 planes in its fleet after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation deregistered them. In March 2024, Asiana Airlines announced it would retire its sole remaining 747-400, leaving Air China as the last scheduled passenger operator in Asia.

==Design==

The 747-400&#x27;s airframe features extended and lighter wings than the previous 747s, capped by winglets. The winglets result in a 3 percent increase in long-range cruise, improved takeoff performance, and higher cruise altitudes. The extended wingspan also gains an additional leading edge flap section. When unfurnished, the basic 747-400 fuselage is lighter than preceding models, but when fitted out it is heavier and stronger than previous models. The landing gear uses the same configuration as the previous 747s, but with carbon brakes replacing the previous steel ones, and overall weight savings of .

The 747-400&#x27;s glass cockpit features CRT displays which show flight instrumentation along with engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS) diagnostics. The flight engineer station on the previous 747s is no longer installed, and the new displays and simplified layout results in a two-thirds reduction of switches, lights, and gauges versus the Classic 747. Other new systems include an advanced Honeywell flight management computer (FMC) which assists pilots in calculating optimal altitudes and routes along with a Rockwell-Collins central maintenance computer (CMC) which automates troubleshooting tasks.

The redesigned 747-400 interior features new cabin sidewalls, heat-resistant phenolic glass and carbon composite paneling, and larger storage bins. An enhanced in-flight entertainment framework, called the Advanced Cabin Entertainment/Service System (ACESS), debuted on the 747-400, which integrates 18-channel audio capability, four-passenger intercom announcement zones, inter-cabin telephones, and passenger lighting into a central system. An eight-bunk overhead crew rest is installed above the aft cabin, while a second crew rest area is located on the upper deck behind the cockpit for flight crew use.

The last few 747-400s delivered feature the Boeing Signature Interior, derived from the Boeing 777.

==Variants==
===747-400===

The original variant of the redesigned 747, the 747-400 debuted an increased wingspan, winglets, revised engines, and a glass cockpit which removed the need for a flight engineer. The type also featured the stretched upper deck (SUD) introduced with the 747-300. The passenger model formed the bulk of 747-400s sold, and 442 were built.

In 1989, the Qantas 747-400 VH-OJA flew non-stop from London Heathrow to Sydney, a distance of , in 20 hours and 9 minutes to set a commercial aircraft world distance record. , this is the fastest heavyweight flight between London and Sydney. This was a delivery flight with no commercial passengers or freight on board. During testing, the first 747-400 built also set a world record for the heaviest airliner takeoff on June 27, 1988, on a flight to simulate heavy-weight stalls. The aircraft had a takeoff weight of , and in order to satisfy Fédération Aéronautique Internationale regulations, climbed to a height of .
On February 9, 2020, a British Airways Boeing 747-400 broke the New York–London subsonic airliner speed record in 4 hours 56 minutes, pushed by the powerful Jetstream linked to Storm Ciara.

===747-400F===

The 747-400F (Freighter) is an all freight version of the 747-400. While using the updated systems and wing design of the passenger versions, it features the original short upper deck found on the classic 747s to reduce weight. The 747-400F has a maximum takeoff weight of and a maximum payload of . The -400F can be easily distinguished from the passenger -400 by its shorter upper-deck hump and lack of windows along the main deck.

The model&#x27;s first flight was on May 4, 1993, and entered service with Cargolux on November 17, 1993. Other major customers included Atlas Air, China Airlines, Korean Air, Nippon Cargo Airlines and Singapore Airlines.

The 747-400F has a main deck nose door and a mechanized cargo handling system. The nose door swings up so that pallets or containers up to can be loaded straight in on motor-driven rollers. An optional main deck side cargo door (like the 747-400M Combi) allows loading of dimensionally taller cargo modules. A lower deck (&quot;belly&quot;) side door allows loading of unit load devices (ULD) up to in height. Boeing delivered 126 Boeing 747-400F aircraft with no unfilled orders . The last -400F was delivered to Nippon Cargo Airlines on August 2, 2008.

===747-400M===

The 747-400M (a passenger/freight or &quot;Combi&quot; variant originally designated as 747-400BC) first flew on June 30, 1989, and entered service with KLM on September 12, 1989. Based on the successful Combi versions of the Classic 747s, the 747-400M has a large cargo door fitted to the rear of the fuselage for freight loading to the aft main deck cargo hold. A locked partition separates the cargo area from the forward passenger cabin, and the -400M also features additional fire protection, a strengthened main deck floor, a roller-conveyor system, and passenger-to-cargo conversion equipment. The last 747-400M was delivered to KLM on April 10, 2002. Boeing sold 61 747-400M aircraft, which was similar to earlier 747 &quot;Combi&quot; versions (78 747-200M, 21 747-300M).

KLM was the last commercial 747-400M operator. KLM initially planned to retire their 747-400M by January 1, 2021, however the Boeing 747-400M was instead retired by March 27, 2020, as Air France-KLM announced in early March 2020 to retire all remaining passenger Boeing 747-400s of KLM (including all KLM Boeing 747-400M aircraft) immediately due to reduced air travel demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, although, due to a global shortage in air cargo capacity, three KLM 747-400Ms were temporarily reactivated after just a week to operate cargo-only flights to Asia. As of 2024, Air Atlanta Icelandic, an Icelandic cargo and charter passenger airline, operates one Boeing 747-400M.

=== 747-400D ===
The 747-400D (Domestic) is a high-density seating model developed for short-haul, high-volume domestic Japanese flights, serving the same role as the prior Boeing 747SR domestic model. This model is capable of seating a maximum of 568 passengers in a two-class configuration or 660 passengers in a single-class configuration.

The -400D lacks the wingtip extensions and winglets included on other variants. Winglets would provide minimal benefits on short-haul routes while adding extra weight and cost. The -400D may be converted to the long-range version if needed. The 747-400D can be distinguished from the otherwise similar-looking 747-300 by the extra windows on the upper deck. These allow for extra seating at the rear of the upper deck, where a galley would normally be situated on longer flights. In total, 19 of the type were built, with the last example delivered to All Nippon Airways on February 11, 1996. This variant was retired when ANA retired its last 747-400D on March 31, 2014.

===747-400ER===
The 747-400ER (Extended Range) was launched on November 28, 2000, following an order by Qantas for six aircraft. The model was commonly referred to as the &#x27;910k&#x27;, signifying its maximum weight achieved via structural modifications and modified landing gear. The 747-400ER included the option of one or two additional body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, but Qantas only ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with two body fuel tanks. Manufactured by Marshall Aerospace, the tanks used metal-to-metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks featured a double wall and an integrated venting system, and achieved fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimized fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight, along with fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank was removable using tooling that interfaced with the cargo loading system. Similar technology had been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the Boeing 777-200LR and Boeing P-8A Poseidon. Other changes to the 747-400ER included the relocation of oxygen system components and the potable water system tanks and pumps, because the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.

The first 747-400ER was used as a test flight airplane and painted in Boeing colors, with registration N747ER. Qantas received the first delivery of a 747-400ER registration VH-OEF on October 31, 2002, although it was the second airplane built. The flight test airplane was later refurbished, repainted in standard QANTAS livery, and registered as VH-OEE. Qantas was the only customer for the passenger version of the 747-400ER, chosen by the airline to allow for full loads between Melbourne and Los Angeles, particularly in the western direction. The 747-400ER could fly farther, or carry more payload, than the -400.

In May 2018, Qantas announced that it would retire the whole of its 747 fleet by 2020, including all 747-400ERs.

===747-400ERF===

The 747-400ERF (Extended Range Freighter) is the freight version of the -400ER, launched on April 30, 2001. The 747-400ERF is similar to the 747-400F, except for increased gross weight capability which allows it to carry more payload. Unlike the 747-400ER, no customers ordered the optional body (cargo compartment) fuel tanks which reflects the desire to carry more cargo, not fuel, as the benefit of the improved payload rating. The 747-400ERF has a maximum takeoff weight of and a maximum payload of . It offers cargo airlines the choice of either adding more payload than other 747-400 freighter variants, or adding to the maximum range.

The -400ERF has a range of with maximum payload, about farther than the standard 747-400 freighter, and has a strengthened fuselage, landing gear, and parts of its wing, along with new, larger tires. The first -400ERF was delivered to Air France (via ILFC) on October 17, 2002. Boeing has delivered 40 Boeing 747-400ERFs with no outstanding orders. The new 747-8 Freighter has more payload capacity, but less range than the 747-400ERF when both are at maximum takeoff weight.
=== Freighter conversions ===
The 747-400BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter), formerly known as the 747-400SF (Special Freighter), is a conversion program for standard passenger 747-400 aircraft. The project was launched in 2004 with conversions by approved contractors such as HAECO, KAL Aerospace and SIA Engineering Company. The first Boeing 747-400BCF was redelivered to Cathay Pacific Cargo and entered service on December 20, 2005. Cathay retired the 747-400BCF in 2017 after 11 years of service.

The 747-400BDSF (BeDek Special Freighter) is another passenger-to-freighter conversion, carried out by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). The first 747-400BDSF was redelivered to Air China Cargo in August 2006. Several Boeing 747-400M &quot;combi&quot; aircraft operated by EVA Air were also converted to pure cargo aircraft by IAI.

Neither the 747-400BCF or the 747-400BDSF has a nose cargo door; freight can only be loaded through the side cargo door as opposed to the newly produced freight variants.

The demand for converted 747-400 freighters declined in the early 2010s, due to the availability of belly cargo capacity on more efficient passenger wide-body twinjets, and new orders for Boeing 747-8F and 777F freighters. Approximately 79 747-400 aircraft were converted before the programs were terminated; 50 of these aircraft were converted by the BCF program, with the remaining 29 under the BDSF offering. Boeing announced the end of the BCF program for the 747-400 in 2016, although conversions had ceased years earlier with no orders after 2012.

===747 Large Cargo Freighter===

Boeing announced in October 2003 that, because of the amount of time involved with marine shipping, air transport would be the primary method of transporting parts for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Used passenger 747-400 aircraft have been converted into an outsize, &quot;Large Cargo Freighter&quot; (LCF) configuration to ferry sub-assemblies to Everett, Washington for final assembly. The LCF has a bulging fuselage similar to that of the Aero Spacelines Super Guppy or Airbus Beluga cargo aircraft.

The conversion, designed by Boeing engineers from Puget Sound, Moscow and Canoga Park, Cal., and Gamesa Aeronáutica in Spain, was carried out in Taiwan by a subsidiary of the Evergreen Group. Boeing purchased four second-hand aircraft and had them all converted; the fourth and final LCF took its first flight in January 2010.

Delivery times are as low as one day using the 747 LCF, compared to up to 30 days for deliveries by ship. The LCF can hold three times the volume of a 747-400F freighter and had the largest cargo hold of any aircraft, until it was surpassed by the Airbus BelugaXL. The LCF is not a Boeing production model and has not been offered for sale to any customers. The LCFs are intended for Boeing&#x27;s exclusive use.

==Government, military and other variants==
* C-33: Proposed U.S. military transport version of the 747-400F, intended as an alternative to further purchases of the McDonnell Douglas C-17 Globemaster III during the 1990s Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft (NDAA) program. The C-33 cost less and had greater range, although it could not use austere runways or handle outsize military equipment and had a higher expected operating cost. The plan was canceled in favor of the purchase of more C-17s. In the early 2000s, An Air Power Australia analysis deck (an independent think tank not affiliated with the RAAF or Australia&#x27;s Department of Defence) looked at modifying the 747-400 platform for use as KC-33 tankers but ultimately abandoned it in favor of the 767-based tanker.
* YAL-1: &quot;Airborne Laser&quot; carrier based on a 747-400F for the United States Air Force. The aircraft was heavily modified to carry a nose-mounted turret and Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (COIL) equipment in order to destroy Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. The aircraft was retired in 2012 after cancellation of the program funding.
*Cosmic Girl: A former Virgin Atlantic 747-400 named &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot; is used by Virgin Galactic as the air launch to orbit launcher for LauncherOne, an orbital rocket.
*Evergreen 747 Supertanker: Global SuperTankers has converted an ex-Japan Airlines 747-400BCF for use as an airborne firefighter, serving as the second generation 747 Supertanker. The converted water bomber carries of water or chemical fire retardant in eight pressurized tanks. The United States Forest Service was considering the use of this aircraft in 2017. Global SuperTanker received FAA certification September 12, 2016.

==Operators==
===Current operators===
, there were 14 passenger and 213 cargo versions of the 747-400 in operation worldwide. The passenger operators are Lufthansa (8), Rossiya Airlines (5) and Mahan Air (1). As of February 2024 the largest cargo variant operators were Atlas Air (35), Kalitta Air (24) and Cargolux (16).

===Deliveries===

==Incidents and accidents==
The first hull loss of a 747-400 occurred on November 4, 1993, when China Airlines Flight 605, flying from Taipei to Hong Kong&#x27;s Kai Tak Airport, touched down more than past the runway&#x27;s displaced threshold during 20-knot (gusting to 38 knots) crosswinds. Combined with the disengagement of auto brakes and retracted speed brakes, manual braking and thrust reversal were not enough to prevent the aircraft from sliding into Victoria Harbour. No one was seriously injured, but the aircraft was written off. The type&#x27;s first hull loss with fatalities took place on October 31, 2000, when Singapore Airlines Flight 006, a 747-400 flying from Singapore to Los Angeles via Taipei, rammed into construction equipment while attempting to take off from a closed runway at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport during Typhoon Xangsane. The aircraft caught fire and was destroyed, killing 79 passengers and four crew members. The cause was attributed to the flight crew navigating to the wrong runway.

The 747-400F has recorded five hull-loss accidents. On September 3, 2010, UPS Airlines Flight 6 from Dubai International Airport to Cologne Bonn Airport crashed approximately 25 minutes after takeoff. The crew of the Boeing 747-400F declared an emergency due to an in-flight fire and attempted to return to Dubai. However, the fire had damaged the flight controls and the oxygen supply, causing the first officer to lose control of the aircraft and the captain to lose consciousness. The aircraft crashed into the ground at high speed during the second landing attempt, killing both crew members. Subsequent investigations determined that the fire had originated from lithium-ion batteries in the cargo hold. On July 28, 2011, Asiana Airlines Flight 991, a Boeing 747-400F flying from Incheon Airport to Shanghai Pudong Airport, crashed into the Pacific Ocean off Jeju Island, South Korea, after reportedly suffering mechanical problems due to a possible on-board fire. Two crew members on board were killed. National Airlines Flight 102, a 747-400BCF crashed on April 29, 2013 (the 25th anniversary of the type&#x27;s first flight) at Bagram Air Base Afghanistan killing 7 crew members. The crash was attributed to a cargo shift of military vehicles to the back of the hold during take-off. On January 16, 2017, Turkish Airlines Flight 6491, a 747-400F operated by ACT Airlines, failed to reach the runway on landing in thick fog at Manas International Airport in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, crashed into a residential area, and caught fire. 39 people died, including all four crew members, and 35 people on the ground. On November 7, 2018, Sky Lease Cargo Flight 4854, a 747-400F overrun the runway on landing at Halifax Stanfield International Airport in Nova Scotia, Canada, and broken into two pieces, causing 3 of 4 people onboard injured with no fatalities.

Other incidents involving the 747-400 did not result in irreparable aircraft damage. On December 15, 1989, KLM Flight 867, a 747-400M, en route to Tokyo&#x27;s Narita International Airport from Amsterdam&#x27;s Schiphol International Airport via Anchorage International Airport, flew through a thick cloud of volcanic ash, causing severe damage to the aircraft and replacement of all four engines. On July 23, 1999, a man killed the pilot of All Nippon Airways Flight 61, a 747-400D bound for New Chitose Airport near Sapporo, Hokkaidō from Tokyo International Airport (Haneda), during an attempted hijacking, and was restrained by other crew members; the aircraft landed safely. On September 23, 1999, Qantas Flight 1, flying from Sydney to London via Bangkok, overran the runway after touching down more than from the threshold during a storm with heavy rain, resulting in aircraft damage and minor passenger injuries; although expected to be written off, Qantas repaired the aircraft and it returned to service. On January 31, 2001, the pilot of Japan Airlines Flight 907, a 747-400D bound for Naha International Airport from Tokyo Haneda Airport, made an emergency dive to avoid a collision with a Japan Airlines DC-10-40 due to conflicting instructions from air traffic control; several people on the 747-400 suffered injuries during the evasive manoeuvres and some interior damage was sustained to the aircraft.

On October 9, 2002, Northwest Airlines Flight 85, a Boeing 747-400 aircraft registered as N661US traveling from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport to Narita International Airport, made an emergency landing at Anchorage International Airport after a sudden lower rudder hardover. On July 30, 2005, Air India Flight 127, over-ran the runway at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport due to hydroplaning, damaging the landing gear and runway approach lights; the incident took place four days after the airport was closed due to flooding in the city of Mumbai, and two days after reopening. On July 25, 2008, Qantas Flight 30, traveling to Melbourne Airport from Hong Kong International Airport, made an emergency landing at Ninoy Aquino International Airport with a gaping hole in its lower forward fuselage; no one was hurt, and authorities determined that an exploding emergency oxygen supply bottle was the most likely cause.

Some incidents however, led to irreparable damage and those airframes were written off. On September 4, 2009, Air India Flight 829, a 747-437 (registered VT-ESM), suffered an engine fire at Mumbai, shortly before take-off. None of the 213 passengers and 16 crew was injured or killed, but the severe fire damage caused the aircraft to be written off and it was scrapped in May 2011. On 17 June 2015, Delta Air Lines Flight 159, a Boeing 747-451 (registered N664US), flying from Detroit to Seoul-Incheon, suffered substantial damage to the interiors, the nose cone, engines and wing slats, after flying through a severe hailstorm above China. The 26 year old 747 was ferried from Seoul to Marana, Arizona for storage. In 2021, a Boeing 747 freighter&#x27;s engine caught fire and multiple parts detached, causing 2 people to be injured on the ground. The aircraft landed safely and was returned to service.
==Aircraft on display==
Following the gradual withdrawal of older examples of the type from passenger service from the early-2010s onward, a relatively large number of Boeing 747-400s have entered preservation after being decommissioned.
* An ex-Qantas 747-400 formerly registered VH-OJA and named &quot;City of Canberra&quot;, (pictured) the first 747-400 delivered to the airline, is displayed at the Historical Aviation Restoration Society museum at Illawarra Regional Airport south of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. It is the first to be preserved, and also holds the record for the longest non-stop flight undertaken by a commercial aircraft, from London To Sydney in 20 hours, 9 minutes and 5 seconds, a record it has held since 1989.
*N661US, a former Delta Air Lines example, is on display at the Delta Flight Museum at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia. The aircraft was the first -400 series built, serving as the prototype (then registered N401PW) prior to delivery to Northwest Airlines in December 1989. It is also the aircraft that was involved in Northwest Airlines Flight 85.
*In February 2019, a former KLM 747-400 registered PH-BFB and named &quot;City of Bangkok&quot; was transported on a giant trailer from Schiphol airport across fields, main roads and meadows to the Corendon Village Hotel in Badhoevedorp, having been repainted into Corendon&#x27;s livery beforehand. To make this transport possible, the Motorway A9 was closed during the night from Friday February 8 until Saturday February 9. The aircraft was hauled a total of 12.5 kilometres over fields and roads to reach its new home at the hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel, the aircraft was installed in the grounds of the hotel complex.
*PK-LHF, last operated by Lion Air was converted for use as the Steak 21 restaurant in Summarecon Bekasi, Indonesia. The plane was originally operated by Singapore Airlines registered 9V-SMC. 
*British Airways has preserved five of its 747-400&#x27;s following the fleet&#x27;s retirement during the COVID-19 pandemic, although only four now remain.
**G-BYGC, the first of British Airways&#x27; three retrojets and decorated with the British Overseas Airways Corporation livery was on display at Bro Tathan Airfield, within the Bro Tathan Business Park at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, Wales. G-BYGC arrived at Bro Tathan for preservation on 11 December 2020. By May 2023, however, the aircraft was in danger of being scrapped. By August 2023, the dismantling of the aircraft was confirmed.
**G-BNLY &quot;City of Swansea&quot;, the second of British Airways&#x27; three retrojets and wearing the classic Landor Associates livery used from the 1980s to the late 1990s is on display at Dunsfold Aerodrome, joining 747-400 G-CIVW and 747-200 G-BDXJ as a filming location. The announcement of its preservation was made at the same time as that of G-BYGC, meaning that as of December 2020, all three of BA&#x27;s heritage-liveried 747s have been preserved. G-BNLY arrived at Dunsfold on 5 December 2020 after a ferry flight from Cardiff.
**G-CIVB, the third of three 747-400 retrojets formerly operated by British Airways, is on display at Cotswold Airport in Kemble, Gloucestershire in the United Kingdom. The aircraft, which was the joint last of BA&#x27;s 747-400s to leave London Heathrow alongside G-CIVY, arrived at Kemble on 8 October 2020. G-CIVB is decorated with the Negus livery used by the airline during the 1970s and early 1980s, and has been modified for use as an events centre.
**G-CIVW, an ex-British Airways 747-400, arrived at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2020 for preservation after a final ferry flight from Cardiff. The aircraft, which wears the Chattam Dockyard livery joins the aerodrome&#x27;s Boeing 747-200, G-BDXJ, for use as a filming location and trainer aircraft.
**G-BYGA, one of British Airways last 747-400&#x27;s used for flying, was retired on 8 September 2020. The cockpit and partial upper deck was converted into an event space and flight simulator at the Barton City Airport known as &#x27;The Deck&#x27; in August 2022.
*HS-STA, A former Orient Thai Boeing 747-400 was converted into a cafe and restaurant in Bangkok&#x27;s Lat Krabang district. The airplane originally belonged to United Airlines, registered N187UA.
*HS-STB, A former Orient Thai Boeing 747-400 has a fuselage without wing preserved at Flight of Happiness restaurant in Guanyin District, Taoyuan, Taiwan.
*HS-TGR Siriwatthana, A former Thai Airways 747-400 was purchased by a Thai businessman named Somchai Phukieow in July 2018 and had it shipped to his home in Chai Nat Province, Thailand The aircraft had its engines removed and the titles painted over, but is otherwise unchanged from its time in active service.
*HS-TGT Watthanothai, A former Thai Airways 747-400, has been placed on static display at Chic Chic Market in Nong Khai, Thailand, alongside ex-Las Vegas Sands Lockheed L-1011 TriStar N388LS.

<text>Joseph Lee Williams (October 16, 1903 – December 17, 1982) was an American Delta blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter, notable for the distinctive sound of his nine-string guitar. Performing over five decades, he recorded the songs &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, &quot;Crawlin&#x27; King Snake&quot;, and &quot;Peach Orchard Mama&quot;, among many others, for various record labels. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame on October 4, 1992.

The blues historian Barry Lee Pearson (&quot;Sounds Good to Me: The Bluesman&#x27;s Story&quot;, &quot;Virginia Piedmont Blues&quot;) described Williams&#x27;s performance:
:When I saw him playing at Mike Bloomfield&#x27;s &quot;blues night&quot; at the Fickle Pickle, Williams was playing an electric nine-string guitar through a small ramshackle amp with a pie plate nailed to it and a beer can dangling against that. When he played, everything rattled but Big Joe himself. The total effect of this incredible apparatus produced the most buzzing, sizzling, African-sounding music I have ever heard.

==From busking to Bluebird==
Born a few miles west of Crawford in Oktibbeha County, Mississippi, Williams as a youth began wandering across the United States busking and playing in stores, bars, alleys, and work camps. In the early 1920s he worked in the Rabbit Foot Minstrels revue. He recorded with the Birmingham Jug Band in 1930 for Okeh Records.

In 1934, he was in St. Louis, Missouri, where he met the record producer Lester Melrose, who signed him to Bluebird Records in 1935. He stayed with Bluebird for ten years, recording such blues hits as &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; (1935) and &quot;Crawlin&#x27; King Snake&quot; (1941), both of which were later covered by many other musicians. He also recorded with other blues singers, including Sonny Boy Williamson, Robert Nighthawk, and Peetie Wheatstraw. Around this time he was reportedly married to St. Louis blues singer Bessie Mae Smith, who he sometimes credited with writing &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;.

During the early 1930s, Williams was accompanied on his travels through the Mississippi Delta by a young Muddy Waters. Williams recounted to Blewett Thomas, &quot;I picked Muddy up in Rolling Fork when he was about 15. He went all &#x27;round the Delta playin&#x27; harmonica behind me. But I had to put him down after a while. All these women were comin&#x27; up to me and sayin&#x27;, &#x27;Oh. your young son is so nice!&#x27; See, I had to put Muddy down because he was takin&#x27; away my women.&quot;

==Festival fame==

Williams remained a noted blues artist in the 1950s and 1960s, when his guitar style and vocals became popular with folk blues fans. He recorded for Trumpet, Delmark, Prestige, Vocalion and other labels. He became a regular on the concert and coffeehouse circuits, touring Europe and Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s and performing at major U.S. music festivals.

Williams also had an influence on a young Bob Dylan during the early Sixties. According to Lenni Brenner (&quot;How Dylan Found His Voice: Big Joe Williams, the Lower East Side, Peyote and the Forging of Dylan&#x27;s Art&quot;), Williams encouraged Dylan to move away from singing traditional songs and write his own music. Williams later said, &quot;Bob wrote me thanking me for the advice I had given him about music. What he earned, what he done, he got it honest. They ask me, &#x27;Is he real?&#x27; and I tell them that they should let him live his own life.&quot; Williams and Dylan also recorded several duets in 1962 for Victoria Spivey&#x27;s label, Spivey Records.

Marc Miller described a 1965 performance in Greenwich Village:Sandwiched in between the two sets, perhaps as an afterthought, was the bluesman Big Joe Williams (not to be confused with the jazz and rhythm and blues singer Joe Williams who sang with Count Basie). He looked terrible. He had a big bulbous aneuristic protrusion bulging out of his forehead. He was equipped with a beat up old acoustic guitar which I think had nine strings and sundry homemade attachments and a wire hanger contraption around his neck fashioned to hold a kazoo while keeping his hands free to play the guitar. Needless to say, he was a big letdown after the folk rockers. My date and I exchanged pained looks in empathy for what was being done this Delta blues man who was ruefully out of place. After three or four songs the unseen announcer came on the p. a. system and said, &quot;Lets have a big hand for Big Joe Williams, ladies and gentlemen; thank you, Big Joe&quot;. But Big Joe wasn&#x27;t finished. He hadn&#x27;t given up on the audience, and he ignored the announcer. He continued his set and after each song the announcer came over the p. a. and tried to politely but firmly get Big Joe off the stage. Big Joe was having none of it, and he continued his set with his nine-string acoustic and his kazoo. Long about the sixth or seventh song he got into his groove and started to wail with raggedy slide guitar riffs, powerful voice, as well as intense percussion on the guitar and its various accoutrements. By the end of the set he had that audience of jaded &#x27;60s rockers on their feet cheering and applauding vociferously. Our initial pity for him was replaced by wondrous respect. He knew he had it in him to move that audience, and he knew that thousands of watts and hundreds of decibels do not change one iota the basic power of a song.

Williams&#x27;s guitar playing was in the Delta blues style and yet was unique. He played driving rhythm and virtuosic lead lines simultaneously and sang over it all. He played with picks on his thumb and index finger. His guitar was heavily modified. Williams added a rudimentary electric pickup, whose wires coiled all over the top of his guitar. He also added three extra strings, creating unison pairs for the first, second and fourth strings. His guitar was usually tuned to open G (D2 G2 D3D3 G3 B3B3 D4D4), with a capo placed on the second fret to set the tuning to the key of A. During the 1920s and 1930s, Williams gradually added the extra strings to prevent other guitarists from playing his guitar. In his later years, he occasionally used a 12-string guitar tuned to open G. Williams sometimes tuned a six-string guitar to a modification of open G: the bass D string (D2) was replaced with a .08-gauge string and tuned to G4. The resulting tuning was (G4 G2 D3 G3 B3 D4), with the G4 string being used as a melody string. This tuning was used exclusively for slide playing.

==Back to Mississippi==
Williams died December 17, 1982, in Macon, Mississippi. He was buried in a private cemetery outside Crawford, near the Lowndes County line. His headstone was primarily paid for by friends and partially funded by a collection taken up among musicians at Clifford Antone&#x27;s nightclub in Austin, Texas, organized by the music writer Dan Forte, and erected through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund on October 9, 1994. The harmonica virtuoso Charlie Musselwhite, a one-time touring companion, delivered the eulogy at the unveiling. Williams&#x27;s epitaph, composed by Forte, proclaims him &quot;King of the 9 String Guitar.&quot;

Remaining funds raised for Williams&#x27;s memorial were donated by the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund to the Delta Blues Museum in order to purchase one of the last guitars Williams used from his sister Mary May. The guitar purchased by the museum is a 12-string guitar that Williams used in his later days. The last nine-string (a 1950s Kay cutaway converted to Williams&#x27;s nine-string specifications) is missing at this time. Williams&#x27; previous nine-string (converted from a 1944 Gibson L-7 presented to him by Wilson Ramsay, known as Beef Stew, a name given to him by Williams) is in the possession of Williams&#x27;s road agent and fellow traveler, Blewett Thomas.

Another of Williams&#x27;s nine-string guitars is kept under the counter of the Jazz Record Mart in Chicago, which is owned by Bob Koester, the founder of Delmark Records. Williams can be seen playing the nine-string guitar in &quot;American Folk-Blues Festival: The British Tours, 1963–1966&quot;, released on DVD in 2007.

In 2003, Williams was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Crawford.

<doc id="391524" wikidata="Q1430632" url="?curid=391524" title="Flight 714 to Sydney">
<text>Flight 714 to Sydney (; originally published in English as Flight 714) is the twenty-second volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. It was serialised weekly from September 1966 to November 1967 in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. The title refers to a flight that Tintin and his friends fail to catch, as they become embroiled in their arch-nemesis Rastapopoulos&#x27; plot to kidnap an eccentric millionaire from a supersonic business jet on a Sondonesian island.

Hergé started work on &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; four years after the completion of his previous &quot;Adventure&quot;, &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;. At this point in his life, he was increasingly uninterested in the series, and used the story to explore the paranormal phenomena that deeply fascinated him. After its serialisation in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, the story was collected for publication in book form by Casterman in 1968. Although noted for its highly-detailed artwork, critical reception of &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; has been mixed to negative, with its narrative being criticised by commentators for the farcical portrayal of its antagonists, the of its protagonists, and for leaving its central mystery unresolved. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated Ellipse/Nelvana series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;.

==Synopsis==
During a refueling stop at Kemajoran Airport, Jakarta en route to an international space exploration conference in Sydney, Australia (as guests of honor for being the first men on the Moon), Tintin, his dog Snowy, and their friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus chance upon their old acquaintance Skut (introduced in &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;). Skut is now the personal pilot for aircraft industrialist and eccentric millionaire Laszlo Carreidas, who is also attending the conference. Tintin and his friends join Carreidas on his prototype private jet, the Carreidas 160, crewed by Skut, co-pilot Hans Boehm, navigator Paolo Colombani, and steward Gino. Carreidas&#x27; secretary Spalding, Boehm, and Colombani hijack the plane and bring it to the (fictional) deserted volcanic island of Pulau-pulau Bompa, situated in the Celebes Sea, where the aircraft makes a rough landing on a makeshift runway. While disembarking from the plane, Snowy bolts from Tintin&#x27;s arms and runs off into the jungle under gunfire. The mastermind of the plot then reveals himself as Rastapopoulos, intent on seizing Carreidas&#x27; fortune. Captain Haddock&#x27;s corrupt ex-shipmate, Allan, is present as Rastapopoulos&#x27;s henchman, and Sondonesian nationalists have been hired as mercenaries.

Tintin, Haddock, Calculus, Skut and Gino are bound and held in a Japanese World War II-era bunker, while Rastapopoulos takes Carreidas to another bunker where his accomplice, Dr. Krollspell, injects him with a truth serum to reveal Carreidas&#x27;s Swiss bank account number. Under the serum&#x27;s influence, Carreidas becomes eager to confide his life of greed, perfidy, and theft, revealing every detail thereof except the actual account number. Furious, Rastapopoulos strikes at Krollspell, who is still holding the truth serum syringe, and is accidentally injected, whereupon he too boasts of past crimes until he and Carreidas quarrel over which of them is the most evil. In the process, Rastapopoulos reveals that nearly all of the men he recruited, including Spalding, the aircraft pilots, the Sondonesians and Krollspell himself, are marked to be eliminated after he gets the account number.

Snowy helps Tintin and his friends escape, and they find the bunker where Carreidas is held prisoner. Tintin and Haddock bind and gag Rastapopoulos, Krollspell and Carreidas, and escort them to lower ground, intending to use Rastapopoulos as a hostage. The serum&#x27;s effect wears off, and Rastapopoulos escapes; Krollspell, eager to stay alive, continues to accompany Tintin and Haddock. After a run-in with Allan, the pilots, and the Sondonesians, Tintin, led by a telepathic voice, guides the other protagonists to a cave, where they discover a temple hidden inside the island&#x27;s volcano, guarded by an ancient statue resembling a modern astronaut. Inside the structure, Tintin and his friends reunite with Calculus and meet the scientist Mik Kanrokitoff, whose guiding voice they have followed via a telepathic transmitter obtained from an extraterrestrial race that was formerly worshipped on the island as gods and are now working with Kanrokitoff to communicate with Earth&#x27;s scientists. An altercation breaks out between Calculus and Carreidas as Krollspell, Mik Kanrokitoff, Haddock and Tintin try to calm them down. Tintin, Haddock, Snowy, Calculus, Krollspell, Mik Kanrokitoff and Carreidas are reunited with Skut and Gino. An earthquake and explosion set off by Rastapopoulos and his men triggers a volcanic eruption; Tintin and his party reach relative safety in the volcano&#x27;s crater. Rastapopoulos and his henchmen flee the eruption outside the volcano and launch a rubber dinghy from Carreidas&#x27; plane.

Kanrokitoff puts Tintin and his compatriots under hypnosis and summons a flying saucer piloted by the extraterrestrials, which they board to escape the eruption. Kanrokitoff spots the rubber dinghy and exchanges Tintin and his companions (except Krollspell, who is returned to his clinic) for Allan, Spalding, Rastapopoulos, and the treacherous pilots, who are whisked away in the saucer to an unknown fate. Tintin, Haddock, Calculus, Skut, Gino and Carreidas awaken from hypnosis and cannot remember what happened to them; Calculus retains a crafted rod of alloyed cobalt, iron, and nickel, which he had found in the caves. The cobalt is of a state that does not occur on Earth, and is the only evidence of an encounter with its makers. Only Snowy, who cannot speak, remembers the hijacking and alien abduction. After being rescued by a scouting plane, Tintin, Haddock, Skut, Calculus and Carreidas are interviewed about what they can recall of their ordeal; meanwhile in Europe, Jolyon Wagg and his family members watch their interviews on television. Afterwards, Tintin, his companions, and Carreidas catch Qantas Flight 714 flight to Sydney.

==History==
Hergé began writing &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; four years after he had ended his previous instalment in the series, &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;. His enthusiasm for the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; had declined, and instead his main interest was abstract art, both as a painter and a collector. He initially planned on titling his new story &quot;Special Flight for Adelaide&quot; before changing it to &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;. While working on the story, Hergé told English translator Michael Turner that &quot;I&#x27;ve fallen out of love with Tintin. I just can&#x27;t bear to see him&quot;.

With &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;, Hergé stated that he wanted a &quot;return to Adventure with a capital A... without really returning there&quot;. He sought to provide answers to two questions: &quot;Are there other inhabited planets? And are there &#x27;insiders&#x27; who know it?&quot; Hergé had a longstanding interest in paranormal phenomena, and believed that a story with such elements would appeal to the growing interest in the subject. He was particularly influenced by Robert Charroux&#x27;s &quot;Le Livre des Secrets Trahis&quot; (&quot;The Book of Betrayed Secrets&quot;), which expounded the idea that extraterrestrials had influenced humanity during prehistory. The character of Mik Ezdanitoff (Mik Kanrokitoff in the English translation) was based on Jacques Bergier, a writer on paranormal topics; Bergier was pleased with this. The name &quot;Ezdanitoff&quot; is a pun on &quot;Iz da nie tof&quot;, a Marols (Brussels dialect) phrase which means &quot;Isn&#x27;t that great&quot;. The television presenter who interviews the protagonists at the end of the story was visually modelled on the &quot;Tintin&quot; fan Jean Tauré, who had written to Hergé asking if he could be depicted in the series shaking Haddock&#x27;s hand.

Rastapopoulos, a recurring villain in the series who had last appeared in &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;, made a return in &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;. In his interviews with Numa Sadoul, Hergé noted that he was consciously shifting the nature of the villains in the book, relating that &quot;during the story, I realised that when all was said and done Rastapopoulos and Allan were pathetic figures. Yes, I discovered this after giving Rastapopoulos the attire of a &quot;de luxe&quot; cowboy; he appeared to me to be so grotesque dressed up in this manner that he ceased to impress me. The villains were debunked: in the end they seem above all ridiculous and wretched. You see, that&#x27;s how things evolve&quot;. Other characters that Hergé brought back for the story were Skut, the Estonian pilot from &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;, and Jolyon Wagg, who is depicted watching television at the very end of the story.

Hergé also introduced new characters into the story, such as Laszlo Carreidas, who was based on the French aerospace magnate Marcel Dassault. In his interview with Sadoul, Hergé also observed that &quot;[w]ith Carreidas, I departed from the concept of good and bad. Carreidas is one of the goodies of the story. It does not matter that he is not an attractive personality. He is a cheat by nature. Look at the discussion between him and Rastapopoulos when, under the influence of the truth serum, they both boast of their worst misdeeds[…] A good example for small children: the rich and respected man, who gives a lot to charity, and the bandit in the same boat! That&#x27;s not very moral&quot;. Hergé also created a secretary for Carreidas in the form of Spalding, whom Hergé remarked off in an interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1968 as &quot;an English public school man, obviously the black sheep of his family&quot;. Another character he invented for the story was Dr. Krollspell, whom he later related had &quot;probably &#x27;worked&#x27; in a Nazi camp&quot;. He was thus portrayed as a former doctor in one of the Nazi extermination camps—perhaps based partly on Josef Mengele—who had fled Europe after the Second World War and settled in New Delhi, where he established his medical clinic.

Although Hergé drew the basis of &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;, his assistants at Studios Hergé, led by Bob de Moor, were largely responsible for the story&#x27;s final look, which included drawing all of the background details and selecting colours. To depict the erupting volcano, Hergé utilised photographs of eruptions at Etna and Kilauea that were in his image collection. He also turned to this collection for a photograph of a flying saucer that he used as the basis for the extraterrestrial spacecraft depicted in the story. Later, Hergé regretted explicitly depicting the alien spacecraft at the end of the story, although was unsure how he could have ended the story without it.

===Carreidas 160===
Hergé wanted the Carreidas 160 supersonic business jet in &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; to have at least the same detailed attention that he had put into all of his fictional vehicles, from the &quot;Unicorn&quot; ship in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; (1943) to the Moon rocket in &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; (1954). The faster-than-sound jet aircraft called for by the new &quot;Tintin&quot; adventure, while fanciful, could not be viewed as implausible and needed to meet the same exacting standards. Hergé, who had reached his sixtieth birthday and whose drawing hand had begun suffering from eczema, left the design and drawing of the jet to Roger Leloup, his younger colleague at Studios Hergé. Leloup, a technical artist and aviation expert, had drawn the Moon rocket, the de Havilland Mosquito in &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; (1958), and all aircraft in the recently redrawn &quot;The Black Island&quot; (1966). Leloup was described by British &quot;Tintin&quot; expert Michael Farr as &quot;the aeronautical expert in the Studios&quot; and his design of the Carreidas 160 as &quot;painstakingly executed and, of course, viable&quot;.

A &quot;meticulous design of the revolutionary Carreidas 160 jet&quot; was prepared, according to entertainment producer and author Harry Thompson, &quot;a fully working aircraft with technical plans drawn up by Roger Leloup&quot;. Leloup&#x27;s detailed cross-sectional design of the Carreidas 160 and its technical specifications were published in a double-page spread for &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine in 1966.

===Publication===
&quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; was serialised in Belgium and France in &quot;Le Journal de Tintin&quot; from September 1966. The series was serialised at a rate of one page a week in the magazine. It was then published in collected form by Casterman in 1968. For this collected version, Hergé had to cut the number of final frames due to a mistake in numbering the pages. Hergé designed the cover for the volume, which Casterman initially thought was too subdued, so he brightened the colours and enlarged the central figures. A launch party for the publication of the book was held in Paris in May 1968, but was overshadowed by that month&#x27;s student demonstrations and civil unrest.

When originally published in English by Methuen that same year, the volume was presented under the shortened title of &quot;Flight 714&quot;; since the series&#x27; republication by Egmont Publishing, it has been referred to as &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;, corresponding to the original French title. Among the alterations made to the story by translators Leslie-Lonsdale Cooper and Michael Turner were shifting Carreidas&#x27; birth from 1899 to 1906, and changing the location of Krollspell&#x27;s medical clinic from New Delhi to Cairo.

==Critical analysis==

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters noted that &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; &quot;continues the debunking process&quot; of the most recent books, with the villains becoming &quot;objects of parody&quot;. He suggested that the character of Carreidas was &quot;one of the most marked features&quot; of the book, for he represented &quot;a more ambiguous character than Hergé&#x27;s earlier creations&quot;. He thought that in doing so, Hergé was &quot;trying to make his world more subtle by eliminating the certainties on which it had been built&quot; and in doing so was &quot;attacking the very foundations he had created&quot;, and that this &quot;self-destructive tendency&quot; became more fully &quot;explicit&quot; in the subsequent instalment, &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;.
Peeters noted that the book &quot;smacks somewhat of [Hergé&#x27;s] hesitation&quot; as he was unsure whether to include an explicit depiction of the extraterrestrial ship. Peeters also thought that the final scene in the book, featuring Wagg and his family, was &quot;tailored to perfection&quot;.

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier felt that the volume &quot;totally demystifies&quot; Rastapopolous, who has been transformed from a &quot;criminal mastermind&quot; into &quot;a farcical villain&quot; akin to a character from the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films. They also noted that Allan had similarly changed from a &quot;cunning, brutal henchman&quot; into a &quot;low-brow, buffoonish thug&quot;. They also noted that Carreidas was &quot;a villain to rival Rastapopolous&quot;. Lofficier and Lofficier saw the &quot;memory erasure&quot; twist at the end of the story as being &quot;lame&quot;, arguing that it would have been interesting to see Tintin interact with extraterrestrials. Thus, they thought that this tactic displayed &quot;Hergé&#x27;s lack of confidence in his storytelling abilities&quot;. They awarded it three stars out of five, characterising it as &quot;a disappointing book in spite of its high promise&quot;.

Michael Farr suggested that &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; represented the &quot;most far-fetched adventure&quot; in the series. He suggested that the narrative got off to a &quot;promising start&quot; but that it &quot;degenerates&quot; as it progresses. He also criticised the artwork, suggesting that as a result of its reliance on the artists of Studios Hergé, it contained &quot;excesses&quot; not present in earlier volumes. Farr thought that the addition of extraterrestrials was &quot;esoteric and speculative enough to weaken and trivialise the whole adventure&quot;.

Harry Thompson praised &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;, believing that with it, Hergé was at the &quot;top of his form&quot;. Thompson thought that &quot;artistically, the book is his greatest achievement&quot;, demonstrating a &quot;cinematic ingenuity of his composition&quot;, particularly in its scenes inside the temple and of the volcanic eruption. He also noted that the scene of the extraterrestrial spacecraft bore similarities with the depiction of the alien ship in the 1977 film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, highlighting that the film&#x27;s director, Steven Spielberg, was a known fan of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Thompson also highlighted the &quot;parallel with big business and crime&quot; that was used in the story, noting that this theme had earlier been present in &quot;Tintin in America&quot;.

The literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; exhibited a number of themes that recurred throughout the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; more widely. He opined that the troubles faced by Tintin and Haddock aboard Carreidas&#x27; jet reflected the theme of the &quot;troubled host–guest relationship&quot;. He believed that Rastapopoulos&#x27; activities below the area that he could be located by radar reflected the theme of eluding detection. In addition, he expressed the view that the flagging relationship of Haddock and Calculus, as it is depicted in &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;, is a form of the wider theme of strained relationships in the series. McCarthy also highlighted the scene at the start the story in which Haddock mistakes Carreidas for someone trapped in poverty and gives him some money accordingly; McCarthy drew parallels between this scene and a similar one from Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s poem &quot;La Fausse Monnaie&quot;, suggesting that Hergé might have been thinking of Baudelaire&#x27;s scene when creating his own.

In his psychoanalytical study of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès expressed the view that the philosophical concept of &quot;the void&quot; appeared repeatedly in &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;, referring to the existence of World War II bunkers and the underground temple as examples. He added that whereas early &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; reflected a keen division between &quot;Good and Evil&quot;, in this story this dichotomy has been replaced by a &quot;meaningless void&quot;, with Rastapopoulos having degenerated from the role of criminal mastermind to that of &quot;a mere hoodlum&quot; who &quot;sinks to the level of mere farce&quot;. Apostolidès further expresses the view that one of the &quot;best scenes&quot; in the story was that involving an interchange between Rastapopoulos and Carreidas, stating that &quot;their opposition is merely superficial&quot;, in this way comparing them to the competing figures of General Alcazar and General Tapioca in &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;.

Apostolidès believed that &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; exhibited many of the same themes as were present in &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; and the &quot;Destination Moon&quot;/&quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; story arc. He compares the character of Carreidas with that of Baxter from the moon adventure, yet notes that the former is &quot;craftier, more childish and inhumane, less interested in research itself than in technological applications&quot;, working for profit rather than the good of humanity. Turning his attention to comparisons with &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, he highlights that both stories feature ancient temples, &quot;weird animals&quot;, and dramatic natural phenomena, as well as the prominent inclusion of amnesia.

== Adaptations ==

In 1991, a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long. &quot;Flight 714&quot; was the twentieth story of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be adapted. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot;, with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.

<text>Jean-Louis Gassée (born 24 March 1944) is a business executive. He is best known as a former executive at Apple Computer, where he worked from 1981 to 1990. He also founded Be Inc., creators of the BeOS computer operating system. After leaving Be, he became Chairman of PalmSource, Inc. in November 2004.

==Career==
Gassée was born 24 March 1944 in Paris, France.

===1980s: Apple Computer===
Gassée worked for six years at Hewlett-Packard from 1968 to 1974, where he was responsible for overseeing the launching of the company’s first desktop scientific computer and the development of its sales organization in France, before his promotion to Sales Manager of Europe, in Geneva, Switzerland. From 1974 to 1981, Gassée served as the Chief Executive Officer of the French affiliates of Data General and Exxon Office Systems.

In 1981, Gassée became Director of European Operations at Apple Computer. In 1985, after learning of Steve Jobs&#x27;s plan to oust CEO John Sculley over Memorial Day weekend while Sculley was in China, Gassée preemptively informed the board of directors, which eventually led to Jobs leaving Apple.

Later, Sculley personally appointed Gassée to Jobs&#x27;s old position as head of Macintosh development. Gassée introduced several Macintosh products on-stage in the late 1980s including the Macintosh Portable in 1989, and also the Macintosh IIfx. In his product introductions, he was often very comical. Gassée was less formal than many executives. He wore tailored suits when necessary, but he often addressed employees wearing a black (lambskin) leather jacket and a single diamond-stud earring.

When the idea of licensing the Mac OS for other companies use was brought up by various members of Apple, Jean-Louis refused to give in to the idea, maintaining that the Macintosh was more powerful than any other computer at the present, and had a superior architectural roadmap for future expansion than any other computer. Although many of the companies were interested (such as AT&amp;T, for the use of the OS in their own equipment—they were so interested in this idea that the then-CEO of AT&amp;T made a personal phone call to Sculley), Gassée would have none of it, and so the idea of licensing the Mac OS was shelved.

In the mid-1980s, Gassée started the skunkworks project to create what eventually became the Newton MessagePad.

In 1987, Apple CEO John Sculley published his memoir &quot;Odyssey.&quot; In the hope of inspiring &quot;excellence,&quot; he ordered a hardback copy for each Apple employee, at Apple&#x27;s expense. Shortly afterward, Gassée ordered a paperback copy of Fred Brooks&#x27;s &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; for all product-development employees, in the hope of inspiring good sense in project management. Brooks gave a lecture at nearby De Anza College: the room was filled with Apple employees with copies of his book, who told him stories that confirmed his conclusions.

In 1988, Gassée became head of Apple&#x27;s advanced product development and worldwide marketing, and rumors of his taking over as CEO of Apple from Sculley were circling. Other rumors concerning Michael Spindler were also circulating. At one point in 1990, a number of Apple employees held a demonstration, marching around in circles, carrying signs, on the lawn in front of one Apple building, to petition Apple management to retain Gassée. A &quot;USA Today&quot; reporter saw the demonstration and asked an employee what it was about. The employee, well aware of Apple&#x27;s rules on divulging trade secrets to the press, succinctly explained the issues. The next day, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that Apple employees, many wearing black leather jackets and berets in honor of Gassée, had demonstrated to persuade management to keep him at Apple. In fact, the only person wearing a leather jacket (a brown goatskin A-2) and a beret had been the person whom she had asked to explain the purpose of the demonstration.

In 1989, Gassée successfully killed a Claris project, &#x27;Drama&#x27;, which aimed to start a new brand to sell low-end Macintosh computers. Gassée argued that consumers would continue to be willing to pay the premium price for a full Macintosh experience.

Despite Gassée&#x27;s efforts and those of his supporters, in 1990 he left Apple, forced out by Sculley and Apple board members dissatisfied with his performance in delivering new products. Spindler got the top job.

===1991–2002: Be Incorporated===
In 1991, Gassée started a new venture, Be Inc., with the ambitious goal of creating an entire new computer platform, hardware and software, from the ground up. A number of Apple employees left with him, including Steve Sakoman, the developer of the Apple Newton. Be developed a new operating system, optimized for multiple CPUs and multithreaded applications, which became known simply as &quot;the Be Operating System,&quot; or BeOS.

BeOS was written for Be&#x27;s own dual-processor machine, the BeBox; later development releases of BeOS were ported to run on the Macintosh, and Macintosh clone makers, including Power Computing and Motorola, signed deals to ship BeOS with their hardware when the OS was finalized. In light of this, Be stopped production on the BeBox after selling only around 2000 units, and focused entirely on development of BeOS.

In 1996, Apple Computer decided to abandon Copland, the project to rewrite and modernize the Macintosh operating system. BeOS had many of the features Apple sought, and around Christmas time they offered to buy Be for $120 million, later raising their bid to $200 million. However, despite estimates of Be&#x27;s total worth at approximately $80 million, Gassée held out for $275 million, and Apple balked. In a surprise move, Apple went on to purchase NeXT, the company their former co-founder Steve Jobs had earlier left Apple to found, for $429 million, with the high price justified by Apple getting Jobs and his NeXT engineers in tow. NeXTSTEP was used as the basis for their new operating system, Mac OS X.

After the return of Jobs, Apple withdrew the license to make Macintosh clones. With Intel&#x27;s assistance, BeOS moved to &quot;Plan B&quot;, a port to the x86 platform. While it arguably never grew past a cult following, it sold enough copies to have a nascent development and user community, and had several thousand programs available for it, including several dozen commercial products. BeOS was also used as an embedded operating system in multimedia production systems from Edirol, TEAC and Level Control Systems. However, partially due to behind-the-scenes pressure from Microsoft, Be was not successful in getting top-tier OEMs to bundle BeOS with their hardware - only Hitachi and AST (who were major in Europe at the time) did so - which Gassée saw as fundamental to their success.

At the end of 1999, Be had a &quot;focus shift,&quot; giving their desktop OS away for free (with commercial distributions sold by third-party vendors, similar to Linux distributions) to focus on BeIA, a build of BeOS specifically targeted to internet appliances. The company lost several employees who disagreed with this strategy and who had no desire to work on an appliance OS. While there was vendor interest in BeIA and at least one shipping product based on it (the Sony eVilla), the market for internet appliances proved to be nearly non-existent, and Be laid off most of its employees in 2001, with its assets and the remaining engineers being bought by Palm, Inc. for $11 million that August. Gassée stayed on through that transition, but left in January 2002.

===2002–present: After Be, Inc.===
After leaving Be, Gassée served as president and CEO of Computer Access Technology Corporation (CATC), a company which made network protocol analyzers, but left within a year (CATC was purchased in fall 2004 by LeCroy Corporation, a competitor). Gassée resurfaced as a general partner at Allegis Capital, a venture capital fund based in Palo Alto, California, where he is still in position.

In November 2004, Gassée became chairman of PalmSource, Inc., where several former Be executives and engineers still worked. BeOS technology was being worked on for use in Palm OS &quot;Cobalt&quot; (Version 6), but as of February 2006, there were no major customers—including Palm, Inc. itself—who have committed to using the Cobalt release.

In March 2006, he started writing a French-language blog; it was active for a month and contains four entries.

In 2009, he started contributing regularly to the Monday Note blog, a newsletter covering the intersection of media and technology which is now a part of Medium.

<text>The Crab with the Golden Claws () is the ninth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was serialised weekly in , the children&#x27;s supplement to , Belgium&#x27;s leading francophone newspaper, from October 1940 to October 1941 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. Partway through serialisation, was cancelled and the story began to be serialised daily in the pages of . The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who travel to Morocco to pursue the international opium smugglers. The story marks the first appearance of main character Captain Haddock.

&quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; was published in book form shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1943, Hergé coloured and redrew the book in his distinctive style for Casterman&#x27;s republication. &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; introduces the supporting character Captain Haddock, who became a major fixture of the series. The book is the first &quot;Tintin&quot; adventure published in the United States and the first to be adapted into a motion picture. &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; was adapted for the 1947 stop motion film of the same name, the 1956 Belvision Studios animation &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the feature film &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011) directed by Steven Spielberg, and the film&#x27;s tie-in video game.

==Synopsis==
Tintin is informed by Thomson and Thompson of a case involving a drowned sailor, found with a scrap of paper from what appears to be a tin of crab meat with the word &quot;Karaboudjan&quot; scrawled on it. His subsequent investigation and the kidnapping of a Japanese man interested in giving him a letter leads Tintin to a ship called the &quot;Karaboudjan&quot;, where he is abducted by a syndicate of criminals who have hidden opium in the crab tins. Tintin escapes from his locked room after Snowy chews through his bonds and encounters Captain Haddock, an alcoholic sea captain, who is manipulated by his first mate, Allan, and is unaware of his crew&#x27;s criminal activities. Fooling Allan and his men, Tintin, Snowy, and Haddock escape the ship in a lifeboat after sending a radio message to the police.

Stranded at sea, a seaplane tries to attack them; Tintin and the Captain hijack the plane, tie up the pilots, and try to reach Spain. Haddock&#x27;s drunken behaviour in a storm causes them to crash-land in the Sahara desert instead, where the pilots escape. After trekking across the desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a French outpost, where they hear on the radio that the storm has sunk the &quot;Karaboudjan&quot;. They travel to Bagghar, a Moroccan port, and are attacked by Tuareg tribesmen along the way. In Bagghar, the Captain recognises the &quot;Karaboudjan&quot; disguised as another ship, but he is kidnapped by his former crewmen. Meanwhile, Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson and learn that wealthy merchant Omar Ben Salaad sells the crab tins that are used to smuggle the opium. 

While Thomson and Thompson discreetly investigate Ben Salaad, Tintin tracks down Allan and the rest of the gang and saves Captain Haddock, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Salaad&#x27;s house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now-subdued owner of the wine cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes that he is the leader of the drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries to escape, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as Bunji Kuraki, a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group he was up against. He had been investigating the sailor on Haddock&#x27;s crew who drowned; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. Turning on the radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.

==History==

===Background===

As the Belgian army clashed with the invading Germans in May 1940, Hergé and his wife fled by car to France along with tens of thousands of other Belgians, first staying in Paris and then heading south to Puy-de-Dôme, where they remained for six weeks. On 28 May, Belgian King Leopold III officially surrendered the country to the German army to prevent further killing, a move that Hergé agreed with. Germany placed Belgium under occupation. Hergé followed the king&#x27;s request that all civilians who had fled the country return; he arrived back in Brussels on 30 June. There, he found that an officer of the German army&#x27;s Propagandastaffel occupied his house, and he also faced financial trouble, as he owed back taxes yet was unable to access his financial reserves (his fee due from Casterman eventually arrived). All Belgian publications were now under the control of the German occupying force. The Catholic publication and its supplement , where Hergé had always worked serialising &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, no longer had permission to continue publication. &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, the story that Hergé had been serialising there, had to be abandoned. Victor Matthys, the Rexist editor of , offered Hergé employment as a cartoonist, but Hergé perceived as an explicitly political publication and thus declined the position.

Instead, he accepted a position with , Belgium&#x27;s largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities permitted to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor Raymond De Becker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining on 15 October, Hergé created its new children&#x27;s supplement, . Appointed editor of this supplement, he was aided by old friend Paul Jamin and the cartoonist Jacques Van Melkebeke. The first issue of was published with a large announcement across the cover: &quot;Tintin et Milou sont revenus!&quot; (&quot;Tintin and Snowy are Back!&quot;). Some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration; he received an anonymous letter from &quot;the father of a large family&quot; asking him not to work for , fearing that &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; would now be used to indoctrinate children in Nazi ideology, and that as a result &quot;they will no longer speak of God, of the Christian family, of the Catholic ideal ... [How] can you agree to collaborate in this terrible act, a real sin against Spirit?&quot; Hergé however was heavily enticed by the size of &quot;&quot;&#x27;s readership, which reached 600,000, far more than what &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot; had been able to accomplish. Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight, Hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work, instead adopting a policy of neutrality. Without the need to satirise political types, Harry Thompson observed that &quot;Hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy. The public reacted positively&quot;.

===Publication===
&quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; began serialisation in on 17 October 1940.
However, on 8 May 1941, a paper shortage caused by the ongoing war led to being reduced to four pages, with the length of the weekly Tintin strip being cut by two-thirds. Several weeks later, on 3 September, the supplement disappeared altogether, with &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; being moved into itself in September, where it became a daily strip. As a result, Hergé was forced to alter the pace at which his narrative moved, as he had to hold the reader&#x27;s attention at the end of every line. As with earlier &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the story was later serialised in France in the Catholic newspaper &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot; from 21 June 1942.

Following serialisation, Casterman collected together and published the story in book form in 1941; the last black-and-white &quot;Tintin&quot; volume to be released. For this collected edition, Hergé thought of renaming the story, initially considering &quot;The Red Crab&quot; (to accompany earlier adventures &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; and &quot;The Black Island&quot;) before re-settling on (&quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;). Hergé became annoyed that Casterman then sent the book to the printers without his final approval. Nevertheless, as a result of &quot;&quot;&#x27;s publicity, book sales markedly increased, to the extent that most of the prior &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; were reprinted as a result. German authorities made two exceptions: &quot;Tintin in America&quot; and &quot;The Black Island&quot; could not be reprinted at the time because they were set in the United States and Britain respectively, both of which were in conflict with Germany.

The serial introduced the character of Captain Haddock. Haddock made his first appearance in adjacent to an advert for the anti-Semitic German film, &quot;Jud Süß&quot;. Hergé chose the name &quot;Haddock&quot; for the character after his wife, Germaine Remi, mentioned &quot;a sad English fish&quot; during a meal. The inclusion of the Japanese police detective Bunji Kuraki as an ally of Tintin&#x27;s in this story was possibly designed to counterbalance Hergé&#x27;s portrayal of the Japanese as the antagonists in his earlier story, &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, particularly given that the occupying government was allied with Japan at the time. The use of Morocco as a setting was likely influenced by &quot;The White Squadron&quot; a novel by French writer Joseph Peyré, which had been adapted into an Italian film in 1936 (Hergé had read the novel and seen the film). The depiction of the French Foreign Legion in North Africa was possibly influenced by P. C. Wren&#x27;s novel &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1925) or its cinematic adaptations in 1926, 1928, and 1939.

Whereas Hergé&#x27;s use of Chinese in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; was correct, the Arabic script employed in &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; was intentionally fictitious. Many of the place names featured in the series are puns: the town of Kefheir was a pun on the French (&quot;what to do?&quot;) while the port of Bagghar derives from the French (scrape, or fight). The name of Omar ben Salaad is a pun meaning &quot;Lobster Salad&quot; in French.

In February 1942, Casterman suggested to Hergé that his books be published in a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages, and now in full colour rather than black-and-white. He agreed to this, and in 1943 &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944. Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long, and thus Hergé filled the missing pages with four full-page colour frames, thus bringing it up to the standard 62-page format. &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; contained one of Hergé&#x27;s two favourite illustrations from &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. It depicts Berbers reacting to Haddock&#x27;s manic ravings, eventually becoming terrified of him and running away. Hergé described the action as &quot;a series of movements, broken up and distributed among several characters. It could have been the same individual, lying down first, then getting up slowly, hesitating and finally running away. It&#x27;s like a short cut in space and time&quot;.

In the 1960s, &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;, along with &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, became the first &quot;Tintin&quot; adventures published in the United States, by Golden Press. Meanwhile, Casterman, working with the American publisher Western Publishing, made a number of changes: Jumbo, the sailor who Tintin leaves bound and gagged in Captain Haddock&#x27;s cabin, as well as another man who beats Haddock in the cellar, could not be black Africans as depicted in the original; these were changed to a white sailor and an Arab due to the American publisher&#x27;s concerns depicting blacks and whites mixing together. The accompanying text was not changed and Haddock still refers to the man who beat him as a &quot;Negro&quot;. Also by request of the Americans, scenes of Haddock drinking directly from bottles of whiskey on the lifeboat and the plane were blanked out, keeping only the text. The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Hergé to be more acceptable, and they appear this way in published editions around the world. Casterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of the fourth volume in their collection. In 1989, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition.

==Critical analysis==
Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters described the story as a &quot;rebirth&quot; for &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and described the addition of Haddock as &quot;a formidable narrative element&quot;, one which &quot;profoundly changed the spirit of the series&quot;. Elsewhere, he asserts that it is Haddock&#x27;s appearance which &quot;makes this book so memorable&quot; and that he is tempted to define the book by that character&#x27;s début. Fellow biographer Pierre Assouline commented that &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; had &quot;a certain charm&quot; stemming from its use of &quot;exoticism and colonial nostalgia, for the French especially, evoking their holdings in North Africa&quot;. Michael Farr asserted that the arrival of Haddock was the most &quot;remarkable&quot; element of the story, offering the series &quot;tremendous new potential&quot;. He also thought that the dream sequences reflected the popularity of surrealism at the time, and that the influence of cinema, in particular the films of Alfred Hitchcock, is apparent in the story.

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier described the story as &quot;a thinly-disguised remake of &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;&quot;, an &quot;Adventure of Tintin&quot; which had been first serialised in 1934. Both feature the smuggling of opium, in crab tins and cigars respectively, and &quot;desert treks, hostile tribes and, at the end, the infiltrating of a secret underground lair&quot;. They also opined that artistically, the story represented &quot;a turning point in Hergé&#x27;s career&quot;, because he had to switch to a daily format in , although as a result of this they felt that the final third of the story &quot;seems rushed&quot;. Stating that the inclusion of a Japanese detective investigating drug smuggling in the Mediterranean makes no sense within the context of 1940s Europe, they ultimately awarded the story three out of five stars.
Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University, in a psychoanalytical review of &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;, commented that this book witnessed Tintin&#x27;s &quot;real entrance into the community of human beings&quot; as he gains an &quot;older brother&quot; in Haddock. He also believed that the recurring image of alcohol throughout the story was symbolic of sexuality. In particular, he believed that there was a strong homoerotic subtext between Haddock and Tintin, represented in the two delirious sequences; in one, Haddock envisions Tintin as a champagne bottle frothing at the top (thereby symbolising an ejaculating penis), while in the other, Tintin dreams that he is trapped inside a bottle, with Haddock about to stick a corkscrew into him (thereby symbolising sexual penetration). However, Apostolidès notes, in both instances the pair are prevented from realising their sexual fantasies. Literary critic Tom McCarthy concurred with Apostolidès on this point, also highlighting what he perceived as homoerotic undertones to these two scenes. He also noted that in this &quot;Adventure&quot;, the manner in which a chance finding of a tin can on a Belgian street leads Tintin into the story is representative of the recurring theme of &quot;Tintin the detective&quot; found throughout the series.

==Adaptations==
In 1947, the first &quot;Tintin&quot; motion picture was created: the stop motion-animated feature film &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;, faithfully adapted by producer Wilfried Bouchery for Films Claude Misonne. It was first shown at the ABC Cinema on 11 January for a group of invited guests. It was screened publicly only once, on 21 December of that year, before Bouchery declared bankruptcy and fled to Argentina.

In 1957, the animation company Belvision Studios produced a string of colour adaptations based upon Hergé&#x27;s original comics, adapting eight of the &quot;Adventures&quot; into a series of daily five-minute episodes. &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; was the fifth such story to be adapted, being directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, himself a well-known cartoonist who in later years would become editor-in-chief of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine.

In 1991, a second animated series based upon &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana. Adapting 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long, with most stories spanning two episodes, &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; was the seventh story produced in the series. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, critics have praised the series for being &quot;generally faithful&quot;, with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.

A 2011 motion capture feature film directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson was released in most of the world October–November 2011, under the title &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, and in the US on 21 December, where it was simply titled &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The film is partially based on &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;, combined with elements of &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;. A video-game tie-in to the movie was released in October 2011.

==In popular culture==

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;In the Name of the Grandfather&quot; Bart Simpson makes a derogatory remark about Belgium, causing his mother Marge to threaten him with &quot;taking his Tintins away&quot;, whereupon Bart clutches a copy of the Tintin album &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; to his chest, promising he&#x27;ll behave.

<text>John William DiMaggio ( ; born September 4, 1968) is an American actor. His various voice roles include Bender on &quot;Futurama&quot;, Jake the Dog on &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, Marcus Fenix in the &quot;Gears of War&quot; series, Dr. Drakken on &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, Hak Foo in &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot;, The Scotsman on &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, Brother Blood on &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;, Shnitzel on &quot;Chowder&quot;, Fu Dog on &quot;American Dragon: Jake Long&quot;, Hammerhead and Sandman on &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, Aquaman on &quot;&quot;, King Zøg on &quot;Disenchantment&quot;, Jocktopus on &quot;Fish Hooks&quot;, Wakka and Kimahri in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, Rath in the &quot;Ben 10&quot; franchise, Crosshairs, Leadfoot, Nitro Zeus, Transit and Stratosphere in the &quot;Transformers&quot; film franchise, and Gonza in the English version of &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;.

==Early life==
Born and raised in North Plainfield, New Jersey, DiMaggio graduated from North Plainfield High School in 1986. He is of Italian descent, and was raised in the Catholic faith. He attended Rutgers University. One of his schoolmates was political strategist Steve Schmidt.

==Career==
DiMaggio is known for his roles as Bender on &quot;Futurama&quot;, Marcus Fenix in the &quot;Gears of War&quot; franchise, Dr. Drakken on &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, Jake the Dog on &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, Wakka and Kimahri in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, and Niblet on &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;. He is a former comedian, appearing on stage as part of a comic duo named &quot;Red Johnny and the Round Guy&quot; and has several on-screen credits, such as Steve Ballmer in &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; (the docudrama about the history of Apple Computer and Microsoft) and as Dr. Sean Underhill, a recurring character on &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;.

In 2013, he was the executive producer and narrator of &quot;I Know That Voice&quot;, a documentary on voice acting, along with producer Tommy Reid and director Lawrence Shapiro.

In 2022, upon news that &quot;Futurama&quot; would be revived for a second time through Disney and Hulu, DiMaggio ran into conflict during negotiations while demanding more money to reprise the role of Bender, which he dubbed &quot;#BenderGate&quot;. Fans supported DiMaggio&#x27;s hold out for better pay, while DiMaggio stated that he felt the entire cast deserved better pay and that it reflected a corporate attempt to take advantage of voice actors. The effort also received support from DiMaggio&#x27;s colleagues, including veteran voice actors Tara Strong, Kari Wahlgren, and Mark Hamill, while James Adomian noted that a casting call for a sound-alike of DiMaggio had been sent out by the studio. While it was initially reported that DiMaggio would not be returning to the role, he later announced his decision to return. He revealed that though he did not succeed in negotiating a pay increase, he felt the attention to the issue of proper compensation in the voice acting industry was worthwhile.

==Personal life==
DiMaggio lives in Los Angeles and New York City. He has been married to actress Kate Miller since 2014.

<doc id="391542" wikidata="Q579880" url="?curid=391542" title="CLIST">
<text>CLIST (Command List) (pronounced &quot;C-List&quot;) is a procedural programming language for TSO in MVS systems. It originated in OS/360 Release 20 and has assumed a secondary role since the availability of Rexx in TSO/E Version 2. The term CLIST is also used for command lists written by users of NetView.

In its basic form, a CLIST program (or &quot;CLIST&quot; for short) can take the form of a simple list of commands to be executed in strict sequence (like a DOS batch file (*.bat) file). However, CLIST also features If-Then-Else logic as well as loop constructs.

CLIST is an interpreted language. That is, the computer must translate a CLIST every time the program is executed. CLISTs therefore tend to be slower than programs written in compiled languages such as COBOL, FORTRAN, or PL/1. (A program written in a compiled language is translated once to create a &quot;load module&quot; or executable.)

CLIST can read/write MVS files and read/write from/to a TSO terminal. It can read parameters from the caller and also features a function to hold global variables and pass them between CLISTs. A CLIST can also call an MVS application program (written in COBOL or PL/I, for example). CLISTs can be run in background. CLISTs can display TSO I/O screens and menus by using ISPF dialog services.

Compare the function of CLIST with that provided by REXX.

== Example programs ==

 PROC 0
 WRITE HELLO WORLD!

Adding If-Then-Else logic:
 /* MULTI-LINGUAL &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; PROGRAM. */
 /* THIS CLIST, STORED AS USERID.TSO.CLIST(TEST), CAN BE INVOKED */
 /* FROM THE ISPF COMMAND LINE AS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE: */
 /* COMMAND ===&gt; TSO TEST SPANISH */
 /********************************************************************/
 PROC 1 LANGUAGE
 IF &amp;LANGUAGE = SPANISH THEN +
 WRITE HOLA, MUNDO
 ELSE IF &amp;LANGUAGE = FRENCH THEN +
 WRITE BONJOUR, MONDE
 ELSE +
 WRITE HELLO, WORLD
 EXIT

<doc id="391544" wikidata="Q7814901" url="?curid=391544" title="Tom Bates">
<text>Thomas H. Bates (born February 9, 1938) was the 21st mayor of Berkeley, California, and a member of the California State Assembly. Bates is married to Loni Hancock, another former mayor of Berkeley and State Assembly member who served in the California State Senate. He is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley and was a member of the Golden Bears&#x27; 1959 Rose Bowl team. Bates was a captain in the United States Army Reserves after graduating from college and served in Germany. He worked in real estate before serving on the Alameda County Board of Supervisors and in the state legislature.

== Alameda County Board of Supervisors ==
Bates was the youngest elected Supervisor in Alameda County history at the age of 34 and the first full-time Supervisor from 1971 to 1976. During his term Alameda County gave the highest percentage of its Community Revenue Sharing money to community-based programs. The following programs were funded: Asian Health Center, Asian Mental Health Center, Clínica de la Raza, East Oakland Health Clinic, Over 60 Clinic, Center for Independence Living, Bonita House, Berkeley Place, Berkeley Battered Women&#x27;s Shelter, Filipinos for Affirmative Action, Berkeley-Oakland Support Services, Pro Arts, Berkeley Youth Alternatives, Berkeley Free Clinic, Pacific Center, Creative Growth Center, Bananas, Berkeley Women&#x27;s Health Center, Berkeley Rape Crisis Center, and West Oakland Health Center. The County also enacted a 100-acre minimum zoning law to protect agricultural open space.

== State Assembly ==

Bates served in the California State Assembly representing the 12th District (the East Bay Area) from 1977 to 1993 and the 14th District from 1993 to 1997. During those years he was known as one of the legislature&#x27;s most liberal members. Under Republican governors, Bates authored over 220 bills that became law, including the creation of the East Bay Shoreline State Park, a number of progressive social policy laws including the Community Residential Treatment legislation (&quot;the Bates Bill&quot;), and the founding of the first Community Bank in the Bay Area. Bates authored the first legislation in the country allowing &quot;brew pubs&quot;, establishments that brew their own beer for sales on and off the premises and are typically combined with a restaurant.

After retiring from the Assembly in 1996, Bates taught at UC Berkeley and worked to ensure healthier foods in the Oakland and Berkeley school districts. In 2002 Bates was drafted out of retirement to challenge the two-term incumbent mayor of Berkeley, Shirley Dean. He won the race with 55% of the vote.

== Mayor ==
Bates personally stole approximately 200 copies of &quot;The Daily Californian&quot; on the day before the 2002 Berkeley mayoral election after the student-run campus newspaper endorsed his opponent, then-Mayor Shirley Dean. He won the election the next day. Bates acknowledged taking the papers and wasn&#x27;t charged but voluntarily donated $500 to the Daily Cal. Following his election, Bates led the city council in passing an ordinance that outlawed the stealing of free newspapers and gave a series of talks discussing his mistakes and what he learned from them. Four years later the California legislature passed a similar law that applies statewide.

Housing and urban development were major issues throughout Bates&#x27;s tenure as mayor. His success in promoting an environmental agenda as a member the California Assembly led him to partner with environmental groups like the Sierra Club in promoting a series of &quot;Smart Growth&quot; policies for Berkeley and the Bay Area. In addition to advocating dense, transit-oriented urban development, Bates worked to mitigate the effects of Berkeley&#x27;s rapidly rising housing costs on the city&#x27;s low-income residents. He proposed a municipal density bonus program to incentivize the inclusion of affordable units in new developments and increase the fees that developers must pay into the city&#x27;s Housing Trust Fund. Bates also put up resistance to UC Berkeley&#x27;s expansion. In 2004, following the release of UC&#x27;s Long-Range Development Plan, he promised to fight the expansion &quot;tooth and nail.&quot; Saying &quot;the university asked us to sign the equivalent of a blank check,&quot; Bates announced that the city would file a $4.1 million lawsuit against the university. After a year of negotiations in which the university agreed to increase its ongoing fiscal support for city services, the lawsuit was settled for $1.2 million.

In 2004 Berkeley voters approved Measure I, amending the city&#x27;s charter to change the date of mayoral elections to coincide with presidential elections and to adjust the mayor&#x27;s 2006 term to two years on a one-time basis to accomplish this result. Therefore the next mayoral election took place in 2008.In 2006 Bates won reelection in a landslide, defeating former City Planning Commissioner Zelda Bronstein 63% to 31%, the largest margin of victory in a Berkeley mayor&#x27;s race since 1967. (Native American and community activist Zachary Runningwolf and Christian Pecaut won 5% and 1%, respectively.)

In January 2008 Berkeley drew national attention when the city council passed a motion to send a letter to the US Marines to tell them they were &quot;unwelcome intruders.&quot; Bates voted to approve the motion. He voted to amend the letter on February 12 to remove language like &quot;unwelcome intruder&quot;. On February 13, 2008, Bates said: &quot;I think it stands [that] we didn&#x27;t want them here and they came here. And [they are] unwelcome. You know, we&#x27;d like them to leave voluntarily. So I don&#x27;t think an apology is in order.&quot;

In November 2008 Bates was reelected to a third term by a large margin, defeating former mayor Shirley Dean 61% to 36% (two official write-in candidates won 3% collectively.) In 2009 Bates appeared in the documentary film &quot;Power Trip: Theatrically Berkeley.&quot; The film is centered around the implementation of Measure G , The Green Measure, meant to help Berkeley lead the nation to a more environmentally friendly future. The film played in Berkeley and is scheduled for a New York release in February 2023 in an effort to promote a staged version.

In 2012 Bates was reelected to a fourth term with 55% of the vote, defeating opponents including Kriss Worthington, poet Mark Schwartz, and Jacquelyn McCormick.

In 2014 Bates placed on the ballot the Downtown Development Plan, which passed by 62% and established transit-oriented development downtown.

In June 2015 Bates was at the focal point of the Berkeley Balcony Collapse tragedy, which claimed the lives of 5 young Irish J1 students and an Irish-American student. Bates was praised by the Irish media for the sensitivity and consideration he showed and the support he gave to the Irish J1 community and the victims&#x27; families. He promised a wide-ranging investigating into the cause of the accident. Considered the likeliest cause was that the balcony was not constructed properly, leading to dry rot, leading to the balcony becoming structurally compromised.

Bates was the longest-serving mayor in Berkeley&#x27;s history, serving 14 years. During his mayoralty, the city built the David Brower Center, the Center for Independent Living building &quot;Ed Roberts Campus&quot;, the YMCA Youth Center and the 5 City &quot;Tom Bates Sports Facility&quot;. He also served on the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Bay Conservation Commission and Development Board and Bay Area Air Pollution Board.

<doc id="391547" wikidata="Q719149" url="?curid=391547" title="Masashi Hamauzu">
<text>is a Japanese composer, pianist, and lyricist. Hamauzu, who was employed at Square Enix from 1996 to 2010, was best known during that time for his work on the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;SaGa&quot; video game series. Born into a musical family in Germany, Hamauzu was raised in Japan. He became interested in music while in kindergarten, and took piano lessons from his parents.

Hamauzu was hired by Square as a trainee, and his debut as a solo composer came the following year when he scored &quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Mysterious Dungeon&quot;. He has collaborated with friend and fellow composer Junya Nakano on several games.

After Nobuo Uematsu left Square Enix in 2004, Hamauzu took over as the leading composer of the company&#x27;s music team. He was the sole composer for &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;. He has also become a renowned pianist, arranging for several other composers. His music incorporates various styles, although he often uses classical and ambience in his pieces. In 2010, Hamauzu left Square Enix to start his own studio, MONOMUSIK.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Munich, Germany, Hamauzu&#x27;s mother was a piano teacher and his father, Akimori Hamauzu, an opera singer. He developed an interest in music while in kindergarten. Hamauzu grew up in Germany and started to receive piano and singing lessons from his parents at very young age, and when he was in high school, he composed his first original music piece. After his brother, Hiroshi, was born, the family moved to Osaka. He enrolled in the Tokyo University of the Arts, where he joined a student ensemble as a pianist. Hamauzu met his wife, Matsue Hamauzu (&quot;née&quot; Fukushi), at the university, and they have two children. Matsue worked alongside Hamauzu on the soundtrack to &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as a soprano and &quot;Sigma Harmonics&quot; as a scat singer; she was also a soprano for the score to &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; &amp; a lead vocalist in &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;. After graduating from the university, he thought about becoming a classical musician, but he eventually found out that he wanted to work with game music instead.

===Career===

A fan of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, Hamauzu decided to apply for a job at Square, where Nobuo Uematsu hired him as a trainee in 1996. His debut project was &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot; with Uematsu, Yasunori Mitsuda, and Junya Nakano. Later the same year, he created four tracks for another multi-composer game, &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;. Working with Nakano on these games, Hamauzu admired his musical style, and they became friends; they have later collaborated on several titles. Hamauzu&#x27;s first solo project came in 1997 with &quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Mysterious Dungeon&quot;. Shortly after the title&#x27;s release, Hamauzu and Yasuo Sako created &quot;Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Coi Vanni Gialli&quot;, an arranged album containing orchestral tracks from the game&#x27;s music. Both the soundtrack and &quot;Coi Vanni Gialli&quot; were praised. For &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Hamauzu was the synthesizer programmer for the rendition of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot;, and provided bass vocals in the eight-person chorus for &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot;.

In 1999, Hamauzu was assigned with scoring &quot;SaGa Frontier 2&quot;. He spent some time conforming to the music Kenji Ito had established for the series before realizing that he wanted to use his own unique style. The project introduced him to synthesizer programmer Ryo Yamazaki, whom he has worked with on most of his subsequent soundtracks. Hamauzu also released &quot;Piano Pieces &quot;SF2&quot; ~ Rhapsody on a Theme of SaGa Frontier 2&quot;, an arranged album featuring piano pieces of the game&#x27;s music. In 2001, Hamauzu and Nakano were chosen to assist Uematsu in the production of the score for the critically acclaimed &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu&#x27;s style. Hamauzu also contributed the Piano Collections arranged album of the game, which he described as his most challenging work, and the track named &quot;feel&quot;, an arrangement of &quot;Hymn of the Fayth&quot;, from the EP &quot;feel/Go dream: Yuna &amp; Tidus&quot;.

In 2002, Hamauzu composed the music for &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot;, a game that would be received negatively by critics due to a variety of gameplay issues. After Uematsu’s departure from Square Enix in 2004, he took over as the lead composer of the company’s music team. He incorporates various styles of music in his compositions, though most of the tune he uses classical and ambient tones in his pieces. In 2005, Hamauzu, Nakano, and the duo Wavelink Zeal (Takayuki and Yuki Iwai) scored &quot;&quot;, the sequel to the 1998 title &quot;Brave Fencer Musashi&quot;. Hamauzu composed the highly anticipated but critically unsuccessful &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; follow-up, &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, in 2006. Later the same year, he arranged the &quot;Sailing to the World Piano Score&quot; at the request of Mitsuda. The album was well received by fans, and helped confirm Hamauzu&#x27;s position as a leading piano arranger of video game music.

Hamauzu released a solo album, &quot;Vielen Dank&quot;, in 2007 after recording it in Munich, Germany. The album includes eleven piano pieces that he composed for personal pleasure after the creation of &quot;Piano Pieces &quot;SF2&quot; ~ Rhapsody on a Theme of SaGa Frontier 2&quot; as well as 14 arrangements of his game compositions. Two tracks from the album were performed at the 2007 &quot;Symphonic Game Music Concert&quot; in Leipzig. In 2008, he composed the soundtrack to &quot;Sigma Harmonics&quot;, with synthesizer programming by Mitsuto Suzuki rather than Yamazaki. At the 2006 E3 event, a Square Enix press conference revealed that Hamauzu would be returning to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, scoring &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;. He left Square Enix on January 19, 2010. He went on to form his own studio, Monomusik, which he described as a personal studio that did not include any other composers. Despite leaving Square Enix, Hamauzu was still hired to score various games by the company, including &quot;Final Fantasy XIII-2&quot;, &quot;Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, &quot;World of Final Fantasy&quot;, and the high definition version of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. Outside of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, Hamauzu also wrote music for games such as &quot;Half-Minute Hero: The Second Coming&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Legacy&quot;, and &quot;The Alliance Alive&quot; in the 2010s. He contributed arrangements to the &quot;Across the Worlds ~ Chrono Cross Wayô Piano Collection&quot; album alongside Akio Noguchi and Mariam Abounnasr.

==Musical style and influences==
Hamauzu composes music in a wide variety of styles, often using multiple styles throughout the various pieces of a soundtrack. He mostly creates classical and ambient music, and uses the piano predominantly as an instrument. He frequently uses dissonance to provide an atmospheric effect. In &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot;, for example, the style of his compositions mix classical marches, tango music, electronic ambiance, instrumental solos, bossa nova, and jazz.

He cites animation composers Hiroshi Miyagawa and Ryuichi Sakamoto of Yellow Magic Orchestra and his father as major musical influences. During his adolescence, he enjoyed listening to the works of Miyagawa and Sakamoto. While attending university, he developed an appreciation for classical music, especially the compositions of Ravel and Debussy.

<doc id="391548" wikidata="Q6803615" url="?curid=391548" title="Mean center of the United States population">
<text>The mean center of the United States population is determined by the United States Census Bureau from the results of each national census. The Bureau defines it as follows:

After moving roughly west by south during the 19th century, the shift in the mean center of population during the 20th century was less pronounced, moving west and south. Nearly 79% of the overall southerly movement happened between 1950 and 2000.

One occasional confusion is the misconception that the point splits the US population into two equal halves, such that half of Americans live east of the point, and the other half west of it, however, this is actually a property of the median center of US population, which is not weighted by geographic distance and lies in Gibson County, Indiana.

<doc id="391556" wikidata="Q8031351" url="?curid=391556" title="Women Writers Project">
<text>The Women Writers Project, or WWP, is a long-term research and digital publication project within the field of feminist digital humanities that makes texts from early modern women writers in the English language available online through electronic text encoding. Since 1999, WWP has maintained Women Writers Online, an electronic collection of rare or difficult to obtain works written or co-authored by women from the early modern period. It is currently housed within the Northeastern University Library&#x27;s Digital Scholarship Group.

==History==
WWP was founded in 1986 by English faculty members at Brown University and literary scholars from other institutions, but those involved were discussing the project as early as 1984. The project was initially created to address the lack of access to early English women writers before the Victorian era and promote new research on the recovered writings. Scholars combined research and analysis strategies from early modern women&#x27;s studies and newly-emerging electronic text encoding computational methods to display and disseminate women&#x27;s writing for new interpretations.

One of WWP&#x27;s earliest transcriptions was a 15-volume series &quot;Women Writers in English, 1350–1850,&quot; completed in collaboration with Oxford University Press, which were released in print and for electronic use.

In 1993, with the publication of the expanded Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines, the WWP began a three-year period of research on how to use the new guidelines to represent early women&#x27;s texts. During this time, few new texts were added to the collection, but a new set of encoding methods and improved systems of documentation were implemented, as well as intensive training for those working on the project.

From 1996 onwards, new texts were once again encoded with the new TEI standards. In 1997, WWP received a $400,000 grant over three years from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to develop &quot;Renaissance Women Online.&quot; The project studied the impact of electronic texts on teaching and research. The project included the creation of introductory materials for 100 texts, currently constituting a sub-collection of WWO. In 1999, WWO was released online.

In 2013 the WWP moved from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, to Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Women Writers Online==
Women Writers Online, or WWO, is the digital collection of early English women&#x27;s writing ranging from 1526 to 1850 maintained by WWP. As of 23 October 2023, the textbase contains more than 450 individual works. Viewing and usage of the texts are available only to individuals or institutions with paid subscriptions. Information about the textbase, such as document metadata, encoding practices, funding records, are freely accessible. The WWP offers a free month-long trial, and the textbase is usually open-access for the month of March, in honor of Women&#x27;s History Month.

The focus of the corpus is currently on hard to find or generally inaccessible texts from both well known and more obscure writers. Within this focus is a sizeable collection of religious writing from the Renaissance as well as works of early fiction, drama, and political commentary. Digitized writers include, among many others:
* Anna Laetitia Barbauld
* Aphra Behn
* Margaret Cavendish
* Queen Elizabeth I
* Margaret Fell
* Felicia Hemans
* Katherine Parr
* Mary Sidney
* Mary Wollstonecraft

== Digital tools ==
In March 2012, the WWP released a new interface for WWO that expanded user&#x27;s search capabilities.

WWO uses digital humanities theory and practice to solicit new interpretations of genre and form within feminist, literary, and digital humanities fields. Queries are entered into the textbase&#x27;s search interface to find occurrences or relevant tagged texts, and these can be further sorted and analyzed using &quot;keyword-in-context&quot; (KWIC) or &quot;Gobbet&quot; display options. Users can toggle between a broader display and &quot;reader mode,&quot; as well as situate the writing on a time slider for historical and literary context.

==Resources and outreach==
Since 2004, WWP has hosted several text encoding workshops and seminars held throughout the year for various skill levels. In March 2011, WWP held their first seminar on XSL Transformations (XSLT) at Brown University.

From 2008 to 2011, the WWP also hosted an annual conference titled &quot;Women in the Archives&quot; in collaboration with the Sarah Doyle Women&#x27;s Center and several other groups at Brown University. The opening seminar held on 22 March, 2008, titled &quot;Revealing Women&quot;, introduced the seminar series as an exploration of how archived writings of early English women shaped the approach to research and pedagogy on the subject.

September 2012, then-director Julia Flanders delivered a presentation at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities discussing the support available for educators and researchers new to XML technologies and TEI encoding through the TEI Archiving, Publishing, and Access Service (TAPAS).

In addition to the Women Writers Online collection, the WWP also offers some public resources helpful for researchers and teachers interested in early modern women writers. These include orientations for getting the most out of researching within the online collection, possible assignments that take advantage of the online user interface, and syllabi submitted by professors that incorporate the online texts and focus on courses in Renaissance and early modern literature, women&#x27;s studies, and related subjects.

<doc id="391559" wikidata="Q1028089" url="?curid=391559" title="Green Carnation">
<text>Green Carnation is a Norwegian progressive metal band from Kristiansand, formed in 1990. Green Carnation&#x27;s trend of music has continuously changed on every release one by one; from straight forward death metal in their demo, to death-doom, then a progressive doom metal sound, to an atmospheric gothic metal sound, to a melancholic hard rock sound and in 2006, went as far as to releasing an entirely acoustic album &quot;Acoustic Verses&quot;. The band released its first album in 14 years titled &quot;Leaves of Yesteryear&quot; on May 8, 2020, which marked a return to their earlier gothic progressive metal roots. A new single was composed, arranged, rehearsed and they were went on to record “The World Without a View” during the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;The World Without a View&quot; was released digitally on December 18, 2020.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1990–2001)===
Green Carnation is the creation of former Emperor bass player Terje Vik Schei (a.k.a. Tchort), founded before Tchort joined Emperor in 1990. It eventually split, with the remaining members X-Botteri, Cm:Botteri and Anders Kobro creating avant-garde metal band In the Woods....

Green Carnation&#x27;s first album, &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot;, was not recorded until 1998 and was released in October 2000 through German record company Prophecy Productions. The release was a folk inspired doom metal album. The Botteri brothers, Alf Tore Rasmussen, and Geir Solli left the band after recording the debut album, and then Anders Kobro from In The Woods... joined up with Tchort. Together, they spent nearly two years making the foundational arrangements for what eventually became &quot;Light of Day, Day of Darkness&quot;, a single track, 60-minute progressive metal epic which is one of the longest single songs in metal. They then did a pre-production in the studio with Tchort on guitar, Kobro on drums, and Endre Kirkesola on bass. This was enough to convince guitarist Bjørn Harstad, also of In The Woods..., to join the band in time for the final recording of the album, accompanied by Stein Roger Sordal on bass, Kjetil Nordhus on vocals, and Bernt Moen of Shining on keyboards. &quot;Light of Day, Day of Darkness&quot; was released in 2001 via Prophecy Productions in Europe, while the US release was handled by The End Records.

===Genre branching and new identity (2001–2006)===
Following this release, the band released their 2003 full-length album &quot;A Blessing in Disguise&quot; through French record label Season Of Mist. The album consisted of a blend of progressive metal/rock elements, slightly gothic tinges, and hard rock elements and brought the band into another musical terrain. Bjørn Harstad left the band after the recording of A Blessing, a decision he made due to his other work commitments. Unfortunately Bernt Moen also decided to quit the band due to obligations with other artists and solo projects after the Blessing in Disguise tour of 2003.

Two years later the band followed up with the album &quot;The Quiet Offspring&quot;, introducing Kenneth Silden on keyboard and Michael Krumins on guitar. The album was released through Season Of Mist in Europe and The End Records in the US. This album brought the band into an even more hard-rock style of music and is seen by many to be their most commercial-sounding release. At this point, they made the decision to replace Anders Kobro with drummer Tommy Jackson (Jacksonville). Jacksonville was a natural choice since he had been a long-time friend and partner of Stein Sordal&#x27;s other projects, Soxpan, Sordal and Plutho ++). Later in 2005, the band released an EP entitled &quot;The Burden Is Mine... Alone&quot;. This EP marked the debut of bassist/guitarist Stein Roger Sordal as a lead vocalist in the band, with the song that shares the name of the EP and the song was written and performed entirely by him. Drummer Tommy Jacksonville also debuted as songwriter and lyricist on the EP. He wrote the song &quot;Transparent Me&quot; for the album. This release also worked as a taste of what was to come with their following full-length album.

Early 2006 marked the release of their fifth full-length &quot;Acoustic Verses&quot;. This album was yet another stylistic shift for the band. On the album, the band played all acoustic instruments, showing off a softer, warmer style for the band while retaining the progressive and darker feels they established since their debut.

===Hiatus (2007–2014)===
According to Tchort&#x27;s writings in the booklet to &quot;Acoustic Verses&quot;, Green Carnation&#x27;s next studio release was going to be the second part of &quot;The Chronicles of Doom&quot; trilogy, which began with &quot;Light of Day, Day of Darkness&quot;, and is going to be titled &quot;The Rise and Fall of Mankind&quot;.

In February 2007 Green Carnation recorded their second live DVD, &quot;A Night Under the Dam&quot;, where they played the entire &quot;Acoustic Verses&quot; album as well as a few other songs. The DVD was recorded under a 30-meter-tall dam in the Norwegian mountains and was the last release to be seen by the band&#x27;s current line-up.

On August 17, 2007, Tchort announced that due to the poorly organized American tour and subsequent financial and motivational losses, the line up of Green Carnation had split up. ( , ). He stated that he would &quot;continue writing music under the name Green Carnation, but probably will never play live again with the band.&quot;
The expected album, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Mankind&quot;, has been postponed with no current release date, but Tchort has said that the album will be released sometime in the future. However, the announced album title was eventually discarded for unknown reasons after the group&#x27;s long break.

=== Reunion (2014–present) ===
On February 20, 2014, the band members announced that they would reunite for a second version of &quot;A Night Under the Dam&quot; on July 31, 2014 ). In the same press release, they further announced their availability for festivals and shows. A short documentary about the reunion show has been released on the Norwegian website Eternal-Terror.

On September 10, 2016, Green Carnation made its debut at ProgPower USA (PPUSA) at Center Stage in Atlanta, Georgia. The band played &quot;Light of Day, Day of Darkness&quot; in its entirety to a sold-out venue. This performance received rave reviews and many claim it to be one of the best performances ever, at PPUSA. 

On August 24, 2018, the group released their third live album &quot;Last Day of Darkness&quot; on DVD/CD format under the Prophecy Productions label. The show was recorded at the Kilden Centre, Kristiansand on November 26, 2016.

The band announced the recording of their first album in 14 years titled &quot;Leaves of Yesteryear&quot;. On March 5, 2020, was released the title track as a music video and a single for digital download. On May 6, 2020, the band did a live listening party via YouTube to introduce the world to their sixth studio album.

Finally, &quot;Leaves of Yesteryear&quot; was released on May 8, 2020, via Season of Mist and produced by Green Carnation and Endre Kirkesola. The album was recorded and mixed by Endre Kirkesola. The mastering was done by mastering engineer Maor Appelbaum.

On November 13, 2020, the band released the single &quot;The World Without a View&quot;, only available as a streaming video and digital download via Season of Mist. The song was since released digitally on December 18, 2020.

In December 2021, the remastered edition of the 2006-album &quot;Acoustic Verses&quot; was released, with new cover art and additional songs. It was followed by the single release of &quot;Time in a Bottle&quot;, a cover song, originally written by Jim Croce.

<text>The Khabur River is the largest perennial tributary to the Euphrates in Syria. Although the Khabur originates in Turkey, the karstic springs around Ras al-Ayn are the river&#x27;s main source of water. Several important wadis join the Khabur north of Al-Hasakah, together creating what is known as the Khabur Triangle, or Upper Khabur area. From north to south, annual rainfall in the Khabur basin decreases from over 400 mm to less than 200 mm. This has made the river a vital water source for agriculture throughout history. The Khabur joins the Euphrates near the town of Busayrah.

The course of the Khabur can be divided into two distinct zones: the Upper Khabur area or Khabur Triangle north of Al-Hasakah, and the Middle and Lower Khabur between Al-Hasakah and Busayrah.

===Tributaries===
The tributaries to the Khabur are listed from east to west. Most of these wadis only carry water for part of the year.

==History==
In ancient times, the river was known in Akkadian and Amorite as &quot;ḫabur&quot;, in , and in .

The river was well noted by ancient writers, with various names used by various writers: Ptolemy and Pliny the Elder called it the &quot;Chaboras&quot; (), Procopius called it the &quot;Chabura&quot;, Strabo, Zosimus, and Ammianus Marcellinus called it the &quot;Aborrhas&quot; (Ἀβόρρας), and Isidore of Charax called it the &quot;Aburas&quot; (Ἀβούρας). It was described as a large river of Mesopotamia which rose in Mons Masius, about from Nisibis, and flowed into the Euphrates at Circesium (Kerkesiah). Procopius speaks of it as a river of importance, and Ammianus states that Julian the Apostate crossed it &quot;per navalem Aborae pontem&quot;. Strabo describes it as near the town of Anthemusias.

The river is fed by several smaller streams, the names of which are mentioned by the later classical writers. These are, the Scirtus (Procop. &quot;de Aedif.&quot; 2.7), the Cordes (Procop. &quot;de Aedif.&quot; 2.2), and the Mygdonius (Julian. &quot;Or.&quot; i.).

Ptolemy (5.18.6) mentions a town called Chabora (Χαβώρα), on the Euphrates, which he places near Nicephorion, and which probably derives its name from the river, and Theophylact Simocatta mentions Ἀβορέων φρούριον, which is, as certainly, the same place.

Since the 1930s, numerous archaeological excavations and surveys have been carried out in the Khabur Valley, indicating that the region has been occupied since the Lower Palaeolithic period. Important sites that have been excavated include Tell Halaf, Tell Brak, Tell Leilan, Tell Mashnaqa, Tell Mozan and Tell Barri. The region has given its name to a distinctive painted ware found in northern Mesopotamia and Syria in the early 2nd millennium BCE, called Khabur ware. The region of the Khabur River is also associated with the rise of the Kingdom of the Mitanni that flourished c. 1500–1300 BC.

The Khabur River is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible: &quot;Tiglath-Pileser ... took the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh into exile. He took them to Halah, Habor (Khabur), Hara and the River Gozan, where they are to this day&quot;. The identification of the Khabur with the Habor is not contested.

The ancient city of Corsote, visited by Cyrus the Younger on his ill-fated expedition against the Persians as told by Xenophon, was located at the confluence of the Khabur River, known by them as the &#x27;Mascas&#x27;, and the Euphrates according to Robin Waterfield. Other authors have been circumspect upon the precise location of Corsote due to the changing names and courses of the rivers since that time.

The Khabur river was sometimes identified with the Chebar or Kebar, the location of Tel Abib and setting of several important scenes of the Book of Ezekiel. However, recent scholarship identifies the Chebar as the &quot;ka-ba-ru&quot; waterway mentioned among the 5th century BCE Murushu archives from Nippur, close to Nippur and the Shatt el-Nil, a silted up canal toward the east of Babylon.

===Modern Khabur River Valley===

The Khabur River Project, begun in the 1960s, involved the construction of a series of dams and canals. Three dams were built in the Khabur Basin as part of a large irrigation scheme that also includes the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates. The section of the Khabur River within Tell Tamer Subdistrict are home to a self-governing Assyrian enclave. Two dams, Hasakah West and Hasakah East, have been constructed on tributaries to the Khabur between Ra&#x27;s al-&#x27;Ayn and Al-Hasakah. The capacity of the reservoir of Hasakah West is 0.09 km3, and is also the southeastern end of the Assyrian enclave. The capacity of Hasakah East is 0.2 km3. A third dam, Hassakeh South, was constructed on the Khabur 25 km south of Al-Hasakah. The reservoir of this dam has a capacity of 0.7 km3. The Khabur Valley, which now has about four million acres (16,000 km2) of farmland, is Syria&#x27;s main wheat-cultivation area. The northeastern part is also the center for Syria&#x27;s oil production.

<doc id="391563" wikidata="Q1268858" url="?curid=391563" title="Dynabook">
<text>The KiddiComp concept, envisioned by Alan Kay in 1968 while a PhD candidate, and later developed and described as the Dynabook in his 1972 proposal &quot;A personal computer for children of all ages&quot;, outlines the requirements for a conceptual portable educational device that would offer similar functionality to that now supplied via a laptop computer or (in some of its other incarnations) a tablet or slate computer with the exception of the requirement for any Dynabook device offering near eternal battery life. Adults could also use a Dynabook, but the target audience was children.

Though the hardware required to create a Dynabook is here today, Alan Kay still thinks the Dynabook hasn&#x27;t been invented yet, because key software and educational curricula are missing. When Microsoft came up with its tablet PC in 2001, Kay was quoted as saying &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s Tablet PC, the first Dynabook-like computer good enough to criticize&quot;.

In 1989, Toshiba released a sub-notebook computer called DynaBook, inspired by the concept. Kay was personally gifted a unit and was a guest of Toshiba. The company released notebook computers under the DynaBook brand in Japan; in 2018, Sharp acquired a majority stake in Toshiba&#x27;s PC business, now named Dynabook Inc. and has marketed notebooks worldwide under the Dynabook name.

== Original concept ==

Describing the idea as &quot;A Personal Computer For Children of All Ages&quot;, Kay wanted the Dynabook concept to embody the learning theories of Jerome Bruner and some of what Seymour Papert— who had studied with developmental psychologist Jean Piaget and who was one of the inventors of the Logo programming language — was proposing. This concept was created two years before the founding of Xerox PARC. The ideas led to the development of the Xerox Alto prototype, which was originally called &quot;the interim Dynabook&quot;. It embodied all the elements of a graphical user interface, or GUI, as early as 1972. The software component of this research was Smalltalk, which went on to have a life of its own independent of the Dynabook concept.

The hardware on which the programming environment ran was relatively irrelevant.

At the same time, Kay tried in his 1972 article to identify existing hardware components that could be used in a Dynabook, including screens, processors and storage memory. For example:
The Dynabook vision was most fully laid out in Kay’s 1977 article &quot;Personal Dynamic Media&quot;, co-authored with collaborator (and Smalltalk co-inventor) Adele Goldberg.

In 2019, Kay gave a detailed answer to a question on Quora, about the origins of the Dynabook concept.

== Later works ==
Since the late 1990s, Kay has been working on the Squeak programming system, an open source Smalltalk-based environment which could be seen as a logical continuation of the Dynabook concept.

He was actively involved in the One Laptop Per Child project, which uses Smalltalk, Squeak, and the concepts of a computer for learning.

<doc id="391568" wikidata="Q412346" url="?curid=391568" title="Methyl tert-butyl ether">
<text>Methyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether (MTBE), also known as &quot;tert&quot;-butyl methyl ether, is an organic compound with a structural formula (CH3)3COCH3. MTBE is a volatile, flammable, and colorless liquid that is sparingly soluble in water. Primarily used as a fuel additive, MTBE is blended into gasoline to increase its octane rating and knock resistance, and reduce unwanted emissions.

==Production and properties==
MTBE is manufactured via the chemical reaction of methanol and isobutylene. Methanol is primarily derived from natural gas, where steam reforming converts the various light hydrocarbons in natural gas (primarily methane) into carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The resulting gases then further react in the presence of a catalyst to form methanol. Isobutylene can be produced through a variety of methods. &quot;n&quot;-butane can be isomerized into isobutane which can be dehydrogenated to isobutylene. In the Halcon process, &quot;t&quot;-Butyl hydroperoxide derived from isobutane oxygenation is treated with propylene to produce propylene oxide and &quot;t&quot;-butanol. The &quot;t&quot;-butanol can be dehydrated to isobutylene.

MTBE production across the globe has been steady because of its positive impact on engine performance. The global demand has been mainly driven by growing Asian markets. Chinese capacity grew from ~18 million metric tons in 2017 to ~22 millions in 2023, with actual production standing at ~16 millions in the same year.

===US perspective===
Under pressure from the bioethanol lobby, production of MTBE in the U.S. peaked in 1999 at 260,000 barrels per day before dropping down due to environmental and health concerrns to about 50,000 barrels per day and holding steady, mostly for the export market. After the purchase of SABIC, oil giant Saudi Aramco is now considered to be the world&#x27;s largest producer with an estimated production capacity of 2.37 million metric tons per year (mt/yr). Worldwide production capacity of MTBE in 2018 was estimated to be 35 million metric tons.

==Uses==
MTBE is used as a fuel component in fuel for gasoline engines. It is one of a group of chemicals commonly known as oxygenates because they raise the oxygen content of gasoline.

===As anti-knocking agent===
In the U.S. MTBE has been used in gasoline at low levels since 1979, replacing tetraethyllead (TEL) as an antiknock (octane rating) additive to prevent engine knocking. Oxygenates also help gasoline burn more completely, reducing tailpipe emissions. Oxygenates also dilute or displace gasoline components such as aromatics (e.g., benzene). Before the introduction of other oxygenates and octane enhancers, refiners chose MTBE for its blending characteristics and low cost.

===Alternatives to MTBE as an anti-knock agent===
Other oxygenates are available as additives for gasoline including ethanol and other ethers such as ETBE.

Ethanol has been advertised as a safe alternative by agricultural and other interest groups in the U.S. and Europe. In 2003, California was the first U.S. state to start replacing MTBE with ethanol.

An alternative to ethanol is ETBE, which is manufactured from ethanol and isobutene. Its performance as an additive is similar to MTBE, but due to the higher price of ethanol compared to methanol, it is more expensive.

Higher quality gasoline is also an alternative, so that additives such as MTBE are unnecessary. Iso-octane itself is used. MTBE plants can be retrofitted to produce iso-octane from isobutylene.

===As a solvent===
MTBE is sometimes used as a solvent, although it is used less commonly than diethyl ether. Although an ether, MTBE is a poor Lewis base and does not support formation of Grignard reagents. It is also unstable toward strong acids. It reacts dangerously with bromine.

MTBE forms azeotropes with water (52.6 °C; 96.5% MTBE) and methanol (51.3 °C; 68.6% MTBE). The solubility of water in MTBE is reported to be 1.5 g/100g at 23 °C.

In an investigational medical procedure called contact dissolution therapy, MTBE is injected directly into the gallbladder to dissolve cholesterol gallstones. Due to concerns of MTBE toxicity and potentially serious side effects in the event of solvent draining into the duodenum, and the advent of laparoscopic surgery techniques, this procedure is considered obsolete.

MTBE is used in organic chemistry as a relatively inexpensive solvent with properties comparable to diethyl ether, but with a higher boiling point and less solubility in water. As a solvent, MTBE has one distinct advantage over most ethers - it has a much lower tendency to form explosive organic peroxides. It is widely used as a solvent in industry where, for safety and regulatory reasons, handling diethyl ether or other ethers is much more difficult and expensive. MTBE as a solvent is used in the oil refining industry as a method for dewaxing waxy petroleum fractions.

==Persistence and pervasiveness in the environment==
MTBE gives water an unpleasant taste, even at very low concentrations of &lt;30 μg/L (&lt;30ppb).. MTBE often is introduced into water-supply aquifers by leaking underground storage tanks (USTs) at gasoline stations or spills of gasoline. The higher water solubility and persistence of MTBE cause it to travel faster and farther than many other components of gasoline when released into an aquifer.

MTBE is biodegraded by the action of bacteria. In the proper type of bioreactor, such as a fluidized bed bioreactor, MTBE may be removed rapidly and economically from water to undetectable levels. Activated carbon produced from coconut shells and optimized for MTBE adsorption may reduce MTBE to undetectable levels,&lt;ref name=&quot;Carbon: Optimized Activated Carbons for MTBE Removal in POU/POE Systems&quot;&gt; link text &lt;/ref&gt; although this level of reduction is likely to occur only in the most ideal circumstances. There are currently no known published cases of any in-situ treatment method that has been capable of reducing contaminant concentrations to baseline (pre-development) conditions within the aquifer soil matrix.

According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a branch of the World Health Organization, MTBE is not classified as a human carcinogen.

==Regulation and litigation in the U.S.==
===Restrictions on MTBE manufacturing and use===
The Energy Policy Act of 2005, as approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, did not include a provision for shielding MTBE manufacturers from water contamination lawsuits. This provision was first proposed in 2003 and had been thought by some to be a priority of Tom DeLay and Rep. Joe Barton, then chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. This bill did include a provision that gave MTBE makers, including some major oil companies, $2 billion in transition assistance while MTBE was phased out over the following nine years. Due to opposition in the Senate, the conference report dropped all MTBE provisions. The final bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush. The lack of MTBE liability protection is resulting in a switchover to the use of ethanol as a gasoline additive.

===Cleanup costs and litigation===
MTBE removal from groundwater and soil contamination in the U.S. was estimated to cost from $1 billion to US$30 billion, including removing the compound from aquifers and municipal water supplies and replacing leaky underground oil tanks. In one case, the cost to oil companies to clean up the MTBE in wells belonging to the city of Santa Monica, California was estimated to exceed $200 million. In another case, New York City estimated a $250 million cost for cleanup of a single wellfield in the borough of Queens in 2009. In 2013 a jury awarded the State of New Hampshire $236 million in damages in order to treat groundwater contaminated by MTBE.

Many lawsuits are still pending regarding MTBE contamination of public and private drinking water supplies.

===Drinking water regulations===
EPA first listed MTBE in 1998 as a candidate for development of a national Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) standard in drinking water. The agency listed MTBE on its Contaminant Candidate List in 2022 but has not announced whether it will develop an MCL.
EPA uses toxicity data in developing MCLs for public water systems.

California established a state-level MCL for MTBE, 13 micrograms per liter, in 2000.

<text>Dulymus Jenod &quot;Deuce&quot; McAllister (born December 27, 1978) is an American former football running back who played eight seasons for the New Orleans Saints in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Ole Miss Rebels and was selected by the Saints in the first round of the 2001 NFL draft. McAllister was selected to two Pro Bowls in his career.

McAllister is currently a color commentator for the Saints on radio flagship WWL (AM), having taken over from Hokie Gajan in June 2016, as well as for college football games on SEC Network. He also serves as an athletic consultant for St. Martin&#x27;s Episcopal School.

==College career==
McAllister played college football for the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss). He had a record-breaking career for the Rebels. McAllister is the only player in the history of Ole Miss to record three seasons with at least 1,000 all-purpose yards. He finished his college career with Ole Miss records for carries (6 saints for the super bowl in 2025

==Professional career==

===2001 NFL combine===
===New Orleans Saints===
McAllister was drafted by the Saints in the first round (23rd overall) of the 2001 NFL draft. He became the starting running back after Ricky Williams was traded. He went on to rush for over 1,000 yards in three straight seasons (a first in Saints&#x27; history). As of 2005, he ranks first in team record books with 5,586 rushing yards and 44 touchdowns and is first with 22 100-yard games, including a franchise-record nine straight contests in 2003. The Saints were 14-8 when he rushed for 100 yards in a single game, and McAllister has added 212 receptions for 1,577 yards and four touchdowns.

McAllister threw a touchdown pass on December 9, 2001, vs. the Atlanta Falcons. In 2003, he finished second in the NFC in rushing and fourth in the league with a career-high 1,641 yards on 351 carries which is second in club history (RB George Rogers, 1,674 yards, 1981). Including the 516 yards on a career-high 69 receptions, McAllister posted 2,157 yards that season to set a club record and rank second in the NFC. All of these accomplishments were an encore to 2002, when in his first year as a starter he led the conference with 1,388 rushing yards, scored 16 touchdowns and was voted to the Pro Bowl.

McAllister was placed on injured reserve on October 10, 2005, after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, and returned to the roster for the 2006 season. While Deuce remained the starter, he shared time in the backfield for the first time in his career with the Saints&#x27; first-round draft pick Reggie Bush. In his first-ever play-off start (January 16, 2007) McAllister rushed for 143 yards on 21 carries with one touchdown and had 4 catches for 20 yards and another touchdown as New Orleans defeated Philadelphia, 27–24 to earn its first-ever NFC Championship Game appearance in the team&#x27;s 40-year history.

On September 24, 2007, during a game against the Tennessee Titans, McAllister tore his ACL in his left knee. The injury resulted in McAllister being placed on injured reserve, thereby missing the remainder of the 2007 season. McAllister returned to action on September 14, 2008, against the Washington Redskins, carrying the ball twice for 10 yards. McAllister scored his first rushing touchdown in a regular season game since December 24, 2006, in the September 28, 2008, game against the San Francisco 49ers.

McAllister set the all-time rushing touchdown record for the New Orleans Saints with a score against the Green Bay Packers on November 24, 2008.

The Saints released McAllister on February 17, 2009, due to salary cap problems.

After sitting out the entire 2009 regular season, McAllister was re-signed by the Saints on January 15, 2010—just one day before their divisional round playoff game against the Arizona Cardinals, to serve as the honorary captain. &quot;Deuce McAllister has always embodied the spirit of the New Orleans Saints and the city of New Orleans,&quot; Saints head Coach Sean Payton said in a statement regarding McAllister rejoining the team. &quot;We’re excited to have him back with the team and to have him lead us out on to the field tomorrow.&quot; Less than a week later, however, McAllister announced his plan to formally retire from the NFL at the conclusion of the playoffs. Although he did not play, McAllister was on the Saints&#x27; roster when they defeated the Colts in Super Bowl XLIV, and was also given a championship ring.

McAllister was one of the players that tested positive for an ingredient found in the weight loss product Star Caps, though he retired well before the matter was officially resolved in April 2011.

==NFL career statistics==
==Personal life==
McAllister runs the Catch 22 Foundation, which is dedicated to under-privileged youth and adolescents in the Gulf South Region. He previously owned Deuce McAllister Nissan, a car dealership in Jackson, Mississippi, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. He was sued by Nissan Finance, which alleged that the dealership had defaulted on its payments. McAllister&#x27;s Louisiana home was auctioned off by the Sheriff&#x27;s office shortly after.

In 2012, a settlement with Nissan was ordered by a judge, however in January 2013, Nissan again sued claiming McAllister still has not paid the settlement claim.

McAllister filed a civil suit against Razzoo Bar and Patio, a Bourbon Street nightclub, after a Mardi Gras 2004 incident in which he claimed he was assaulted by the club&#x27;s bouncers. The two sides came to a confidential settlement in 2009.

In March 2017, St. Martin&#x27;s Episcopal School announced that McAllister joined its athletic department as an athletic consultant.

As of 2010, McAllister lived in Metairie, Louisiana.

On July 19, 2018, New Orleans&#x27; Fox affiliates WVUE-TV announced that McAllister would join the station as a Saints analyst in addition to his WWL Radio duties, replacing the retired Jim Henderson.
He also owns and operates the Ole Saint restaurant and sports bar chain with locations at 132 Royal Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans and in Boomtown Casino on the Gulf Coast in Biloxi, Mississippi.

McAllister was inducted as an honoris causa initiate into Omicron Delta Kappa at the University of Holy Cross in 2020.

<doc id="391581" wikidata="Q193032" url="?curid=391581" title="Gerontocracy">
<text>A gerontocracy is a form of rule in which an entity is ruled by leaders who are significantly older than most of the adult population. 

In many political structures, power within the ruling class accumulates with age, making the oldest individuals the holders of the most power. Those holding the most power may not be in formal leadership positions, but often dominate those who are. In a simplified definition, a gerontocracy is a society where leadership is reserved for elders.

==Background==
Although the idea of the elderly holding power exists in many cultures, the gerontocracy has its western roots in ancient Greece. Plato stated that &quot;it is for the elder man to rule and for the younger to submit&quot;. An example of the ancient Greek gerontocracy can be seen in the city-state of Sparta, which was ruled by a Gerousia, a council made up of members who were at least 60 years old and who served for life.

==In political systems==
===China===
Between 1982 and 1992, the Central Advisory Commission&#x27;s power and authority often surpassed the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. It was quipped, &quot;the 80-year-olds are calling meetings of 70-year-olds to decide which 60-year-olds should retire&quot;, as CMC chairman Deng Xiaoping did not retire until the age of 85. Also, before that, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong died in office at the age of 82.

===Soviet Union===
In the Soviet Union, gerontocracy became increasingly entrenched starting in the 1970s; it was prevalent in the country until at least 1985, when a more dynamic and younger, ambitious leadership headed by Mikhail Gorbachev took power. Leonid Brezhnev, its foremost representative, died in 1982 aged 75, but had suffered a heart attack in 1975, after which generalized arteriosclerosis set in, so that he was progressively infirm and had trouble speaking. During his last two years he was essentially a figurehead. His premier, Alexei Kosygin, was 76 when he resigned in October 1980, by which time he was very ill and two months short of his death.

In 1980, the average Politburo member — generally a young survivor of the Great Purge who rose to power in the 1930s and 1940s — was 70 years old (as opposed to 55 in 1952 and 61 in 1964), and by 1982, Brezhnev&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs, Andrei Gromyko; his minister of defense, Dmitriy Ustinov; and his premier, Nikolai Tikhonov (who succeeded Kosygin), were all in their mid-to-late seventies. Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev&#x27;s 68-year-old successor, was seriously ill with kidney disease when he took over, and after his death fifteen months later, he was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko, then 72, who lasted thirteen months before his death and replacement with Gorbachev. Chernenko became the third Soviet leader to die in less than three years, and, upon being informed in the middle of the night of his death, U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who was seven months older than Chernenko and just over three years older than his predecessor Andropov, is reported to have remarked, &quot;How am I supposed to get anyplace with the Russians if they keep dying on me?&quot;

====Communist states====

Other communist countries with leaders in their seventies or higher have included:
*Albania (First Secretary Enver Hoxha was 76 at death)
*Bulgaria (General Secretary Todor Zhivkov was 78 at resignation)
*Czechoslovakia (President Gustáv Husák was 76 at resignation)
*East Germany (almost every head of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany was at or above the age of 70 when their tenure ended)
*Hungary (General Secretary János Kádár was 75 when forced out)
*Laos (every former president was above the age of 70 when their tenure ended, while incumbent president Thongloun Sisoulith was 75 upon taking office)
*North Korea (Supreme Leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il were respectively 82 and 70 at death)
*Romania (General Secretary and Conducător Nicolae Ceauşescu was 71 when executed)
*Somalia (President Siad Barre was 81 when overthrown)
*Vietnam (President Ho Chi Minh and General Secretary Lê Duẩn were both 79 at death, while General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng was 80 at death, having also been president until age 76. For General Secretaries that survived their term, the vast majority of them retired in their seventies or higher.)
*Yugoslavia (President and Marshal Josip Broz Tito was 87 at death)

On the sub-national level, Georgia&#x27;s party head, Vasil Mzhavanadze, was 70 when forced out and his Lithuanian counterpart, Antanas Sniečkus, was 71 at death. Nowadays, Cuba has been characterized as a gerontocracy: &quot;Although the population is now mainly black or mulatto and young, its rulers form a mainly white gerontocracy&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote in 2008. Cuba&#x27;s Fidel Castro had &quot;de facto&quot; ruled the country for nearly 50 years, effectively retiring in 2008 at the age of 82, although he remained the leader of the Communist Party of Cuba until 2011. He was replaced by his brother, Raúl Castro, who was 89 years old at the time of his own retirement.

===United States===
The observation of gerontocracy in the United States has been a subject of frequent criticism.

====Presidency====

Under presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the U.S. government has been described as a gerontocracy. At 70, Trump was the oldest person ever to be inaugurated president, until the inauguration of Biden at the age of 78 years and two months. After his second inauguration, Trump was again the oldest person inaugurated as president, at 78 years, seven months, and six days old. 

In the 2020 presidential election, Biden prevailed against Trump, setting a new age record. Biden was 78 when he was sworn in on January 20, 2021, making him the oldest person to be inaugurated president. After turning 80 on November 20, 2022, Biden also became the first president to reach the milestone while in office. Biden&#x27;s age was a subject of concern during his presidency and especially his reelection campaign, culminating in his withdrawal on July 21, 2024. Biden served as the oldest president at the end of his tenure, beating Ronald Reagan&#x27;s record of 77; he was 82 years and two months old by the end of his term in 2025. However, following his reelection and second inauguration, Trump will be the new record holder if he survives to the end of his second term at 82 years, seven months, and six days old.

====Congress====


Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives from 2019 to 2023, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader from 2015 to 2021, were both the oldest holders of their offices in U.S. history. At 87 years old in 2020, senators Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Grassley were both the oldest members of Congress. Feinstein ultimately died in office three years later at the age of 90.

In 2021, the average age of a senator was 64, and positions of power within the legislatures — such as chairmanships of various committees — are usually bestowed upon the more experienced, that is, older, members of the legislature. Strom Thurmond, a U.S. senator from South Carolina, left office at age 100 after almost half a century in the body, while Robert Byrd of West Virginia was born in 1917 and served in the Senate from 1959 to his death in 2010 at age 92. Both Thurmond and Byrd had served as president pro tempore of the Senate, a position that is third in the presidential line of succession.

In 2024, a report from &quot;The Dallas Express&quot; asked, &quot;Where Is Congresswoman Kay Granger?&quot;, a Republican congresswoman representing parts of Fort Worth. Reports indicated that Granger was 81 years old at the time of and as of December 2024 she &quot;had not voted on a single piece of legislation since July 24&quot;, Granger was reported to have been living in an assisted living facility amid reports of her cognitive decline. Previously on October 30, 2023, Granger confirmed that she would not run for re-election after 2024.

=== Theocracy ===

States and religious organizations such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Vatican and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in which leadership is concentrated in the hands of religious elders can be considered gerontocracies. In Iran, parliamentary candidates must be under 75, despite the age of the senior religious leaders. Saudi Arabia, nominally a theocratic monarchy, has been likened to various late communist states, ruled by gerontocrats. Aged king Saud and his aged relatives held rule along with many elder clerics. They were in their eighties (born c. 1930). Since 2017, however, power has become concentrated by Mohammed bin Salman–31 years old at the time when he became crown prince of Saudi Arabia. MBS, as his name is often abbreviated, has sidelined powerful, older members of the Saudi family.

===Stateless societies===
In Kenya, Samburu society is said to be a gerontocracy. The power of elders is linked to the belief in their curse, underpinning their monopoly over arranging marriages and taking on further wives. This is at the expense of unmarried younger men, whose development up to the age of thirty is in a state of social suspension, prolonging their adolescent status. The paradox of Samburu gerontocracy is that popular attention focuses on the glamour and deviant activities of these footloose bachelors, which extend to a form of gang warfare, widespread suspicions of adultery with the wives of older men, and theft of their stock.

African societies such as this are known for their gerontocratic hierarchies. The Yoruba people, for example, are led by titled elders known as Obas and Oloyes. Although not an explicit requirement, most of them are decidedly elderly due to a variety of factors.

American Indian elders and Australian Aboriginal elders are traditional figures of wisdom and authority in many Native American and Aboriginal cultures.

===Other countries===
The Roman Republic was originally an example; the word &quot;senate&quot; is related to the Latin word &quot;senex&quot;, meaning &quot;old man&quot;. Cicero wrote: &quot;They wouldn&#x27;t make use of running or jumping or spears from afar or swords up close, but rather wisdom, reasoning, and thought, which, if they weren&#x27;t in old men, our ancestors wouldn&#x27;t have called the highest council the senate.&quot;

In the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the government headed by 87-year-old state chief minister M. Karunanidhi was another example of gerontocracy. In another Indian state, West Bengal, CPI(M) founderJyoti Basu was 86 years old when he stepped down from the office of chief minister of the state after a record-setting 24 years of office, but he continued to remain a member of the Polit Bureau until a few months before his death in 2010 and was consulted on all matters related to governance by his successor and his cabinet as well as his other party colleagues.

Present-day Italy is often considered a gerontocracy, even in the internal Italian debate. The Monti government had the highest average age in the western world at 64 years, with its youngest members being 57. Former Italian prime minister Mario Monti was 70 when he left office. His immediate predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi, was 75 at the time of resignation in 2011. The previous head of the government Romano Prodi was nearly 69 when he stepped down in 2008. Italian president Sergio Mattarella is , while his predecessors Giorgio Napolitano and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi were 89 and 85 respectively when they left office. This trend has been disrupted in recent years, with Matteo Renzi becoming prime minister at age 39 in 2014, and Giorgia Meloni assuming the office at age 45 in 2022. As of 2014, the average age of Italian university professors is 63, of bank directors and chief executive officers 67, of members of parliament 56, and of labor union representatives 59.

Modern Japan has been described as a gerontocracy (or &quot;silver democracy&quot;) and &quot;generationally unjust, partially a product of the country&#x27;s severely ageing population.&quot;

In Medieval England, aldermen (literally &quot;elder men&quot;) were local political leaders second to a mayor. The title is still used in some countries colonized by the British Empire, such as the U.S., Canada, Australia and South Africa.

During the 2010–2012 Arab Spring, every state in North Africa which experienced a revolution had a leader in their late sixties or older: Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia was 74 when forced out; Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was 82 when forced out; and Muammar Gaddafi was 69 when assassinated. Additionally, during the Second Arab Spring in North Africa and West Asia, Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria was 82 when forced out; Hani Mulki of Jordan was 66 when forced out; Adil Abdul-Mahdi of Iraq was 77 when forced out; and Omar al-Bashir of Sudan was 75 when deposed.

In Bangladesh, prime minister Sheikh Hasina was 76 when she was ousted in the non-cooperation movement. In turn, Muhammad Yunus was 84 when he succeeded Hasina. Earlier Bangladeshi heads of state who left office in their 70s or higher include prime minister Ataur Rahman Khan (at 75) and president Iajuddin Ahmed (at 78, having also been Chief Adviser until age 76).

==Organizational examples==

Outside the political sphere, gerontocracy may be observed in other institutional hierarchies of various kinds. Generally the mark of a gerontocracy is the presence of a substantial number of septuagenarian or octogenarian leaders—those younger than this are too young for the label to be appropriate, while those older than this have generally been too few in number to dominate the leadership. The rare centenarian who has retained a position of power is generally by far the oldest in the hierarchy.

Gerontocracy generally occurs as a phase in the development of an entity, rather than being part of it throughout its existence. Opposition to gerontocracy may cause weakening or elimination of this characteristic by instituting things like term limits or mandatory retirement ages.

Judges of the United States courts, for example, serve for life, but a system of incentives to retire at full pay after a given age and disqualification from leadership has been instituted. The International Olympic Committee instituted a mandatory retirement age in 1965, and Pope Paul VI removed the right of cardinals to vote for a new pope once they reached the age of 80, which was to limit the number of cardinals that would vote for the new Pope, due to the proliferation of cardinals that was occurring at the time and is continuing to occur.

Gerontocracy may emerge in an institution not initially known for it.

American elites, some of whom feared a Bolshevik revolution, consented to reform... Under Franklin D. Roosevelt... the U.S. raised taxes, took steps to protect unions, and established a minimum wage. The costs, [Peter] Turchin writes, &#x27;were borne by the American ruling class.&#x27;... Between the nineteen-thirties and the nineteen-seventies, a period that scholars call the Great Compression, economic equality narrowed, except among Black Americans... But by the nineteen-eighties the Great Compression was over. As the rich grew richer than ever, they sought to turn their money into political power; spending on politics soared.&quot; (p. 22.) &quot;[N]o democracy can function well if people are unwilling to lose power – if a generation of leaders... becomes so entrenched that it ages into gerontocracy; if one of two major parties denies the arithmetic of elections; if a cohort of the ruling class loses status that it once enjoyed and sets out to salvage it.&quot; (p. 23.)

<text>Many materials have a well-characterized refractive index, but these indices often depend strongly upon the frequency of light, causing optical dispersion. Standard refractive index measurements are taken at the &quot;yellow doublet&quot; sodium D line, with a wavelength (λ) of 589 nanometers.

There are also weaker dependencies on temperature, pressure/stress, etc., as well on precise material compositions (presence of dopants, etc.); for many materials and typical conditions, however, these variations are at the percent level or less. Thus, it&#x27;s especially important to cite the source for an index measurement if precision is required.

In general, an index of refraction is a complex number with both a real and imaginary part, where the latter indicates the strength of absorption loss at a particular wavelength—thus, the imaginary part is sometimes called the extinction coefficient formula_1. Such losses become particularly significant, for example, in metals at short (e.g. visible) wavelengths, and must be included in any description of the refractive index.

<doc id="391593" wikidata="Q28490" url="?curid=391593" title="Bridled tern">
<text>The bridled tern (Onychoprion anaethetus) is a seabird of the family Laridae. It is a bird of the tropical oceans. The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus comes from &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;claw&quot; or &quot;nail&quot;, and , meaning &quot;saw&quot;. The specific &quot;anaethetus&quot; means &quot;senseless, stupid&quot;.

==Description==
This is a medium-sized tern, at 30–32 cm in length and with a 77–81 cm wingspan similar to the common tern in size, but more heavily built. The wings and deeply forked tail are long, and it has dark grey upperparts and white underparts. The forehead and eyebrows are white, as is a striking collar on the hindneck. It has black legs and bill. Juvenile bridled terns are scaly grey above and pale below.

This species is unlikely to be confused with any tern apart from the similarly dark-backed sooty tern and the spectacled tern from the Tropical Pacific. It is paler-backed than that sooty, (but not as pale as the grey-backed) and has a narrower white forehead and a pale neck collar.

==Distribution and movements==
This bird is migratory and dispersive, wintering more widely through the tropical oceans. It has markedly marine habits compared to most terns. The Atlantic subspecies &quot;melanopterus&quot; breeds in Mexico, the Caribbean and west Africa; other races occur around the Arabian Peninsula and in Southeast Asia and Australasia, but the exact number of valid subspecies is disputed. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe.
These are the four subspecies listed by the IOC:

*&quot;O. a. melanopterus&quot; – : Caribbean and West Africa.
*&quot;O. a. antarcticus&quot; – : Red Sea, Persian Gulf and western Indian Ocean.
*&quot;O. a. anaethetus&quot; – : eastern Indian, and Pacific Oceans.
*&quot;O. a. nelsoni&quot; – : west coast of Mexico and Central America.

==Breeding==
This species breeds in colonies on rocky islands. It nests in a ground scrape or hole and lays one egg. It feeds by plunge-diving for fish in marine environments, but will also pick from the surface like the black tern and the gull-billed tern. It usually dives directly, and not from the &quot;stepped-hover&quot; favoured by the Arctic tern. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.

<doc id="391598" wikidata="Q28482" url="?curid=391598" title="Sooty tern">
<text>The sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscatus) is a tern in the family Laridae. It is a seabird of the tropical oceans, and remarkably, has evolved the ability to fly for years at a time, skimming the sea surface for food, and returning to land only to breed, on islands throughout the equatorial zone.

== Taxonomy ==
The sooty tern was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1766 as &quot;Sterna fuscata&quot;, bearing this name for many years until the genus &quot;Sterna&quot; was split up; it is now classified in the genus &quot;Onychoprion&quot; as &quot;Onychoprion fuscatus&quot;. The genus name is from ancient Greek , &quot;claw&quot; or &quot;nail&quot;, and , &quot;saw&quot;. The species name &quot;fuscatus&quot; is Latin for &quot;dark&quot;.

The sooty tern has little interspecific variation, but it is usually divided into six to eight allopatric subspecies. Some recent authors further subdivide the Indopacific population into up to eight subspecies altogether, but much of the variation is clinal. The affinities of eastern Pacific birds (including &quot;O. f. manutarus&quot; of Easter Island) are most strongly contested. Six subspecies are currently accepted by the IOC:

*&quot;Onychoprion fuscatus fuscatus&quot; – breeds on tropical Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean islands. Underparts white.
*&quot;Onychoprion fuscatus nubilosus&quot; – breeds across the Indian Ocean from the Red Sea to Indonesia, and also the Philippines in the western Pacific Ocean. Underparts light grey in fresh plumage, dull white in worn plumage.
* &quot;Onychoprion fuscatus serratus&quot; – breeds on islands off Australia, New Guinea, and New Caledonia.
* &quot;Onychoprion fuscatus oahuensis&quot; – breeds in the north-central tropical Pacific Ocean from the Bonin Islands through Micronesia to southern Polynesia and Hawaii.
* &quot;Onychoprion fuscatus crissalis&quot; – breeds in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean from Guadalupe Island to the Galápagos Islands.
* &quot;Onychoprion fuscatus luctuosus&quot; – breeds on the Juan Fernández Islands off Chile in the subtropical southeastern Pacific Ocean.

Two additional subspecies have been suggested by other authors:
* &quot;Onychoprion fuscatus infuscatus&quot; – Sunda Islands and vicinity (included in &quot;O. f. nubilosus&quot; by IOC).
* &quot;Onychoprion fuscatus kermadeci&quot; – Kermadec Islands (included in &quot;O. f. serratus&quot; by IOC).

== Description ==
It is a medium-large tern, similar in size to the Sandwich tern (&quot;Thalasseus sandvicensis&quot;) at long with an wingspan. The wings and tail are long, and it has black to dark blackish-brown upperparts and white underparts, and a white forehead. The tail is moderately deeply forked (more deeply forked than in &quot;Thalasseus&quot; terns, but less deeply than most &quot;Sterna&quot; terns), black, with white outer edges. It has black legs and bill. The average life span is 32 years. Juvenile sooty terns are grey-black above and below with narrow pale fringes on the upperpart feathers giving a scaly appearance above, and whitish on only the lower belly. 

The sooty tern is unlikely to be confused with any tern apart from the similarly dark-backed but smaller bridled tern (&quot;O. anaethetus&quot;). It is darker-backed than that species, and has a broader white forehead and no pale neck collar.

The call is a loud piercing &#x27;wide-a-wake&#x27;, also cited as ; it also has a harsh alarm call .

== Ecology ==

Sooty terns breed in colonies on rocky or coral islands. It nests in a ground scrape or hole and lays a single egg, typically in the afternoon. Although &quot;two-egg clutches&quot; have been reported, they probably occur when an egg from one nest rolls into another. It feeds by picking fish from the surface in marine environments, often in large flocks, and rarely comes to land except to breed, and can stay out to sea for 3 to 10 years. Due to the lack of oil in its feathers, it cannot float, and spends that entire time on the wing.

This bird is migratory and dispersive, wintering more widely through the tropical oceans. It has very marine habits compared to most terns; sooty terns are generally found inland only after severe storms. The Field Museum, for example, has a male specimen which was found exhausted on August 2, 1933 on the slopes of Mount Cameroon above Buea, about ASL, after foul weather had hit the Gulf of Guinea. This species is a rare vagrant to western Europe, although a bird was present at Cemlyn Bay, Wales for 11 days in July 2005.

It is also not normally found on the Pacific coasts of the Americas due to its pelagic habits. At Baja California, where several nesting locations are offshore, it can be seen more frequently, whereas for example only two individuals have ever been recorded on the coast of El Salvador - one ring recovered in 1972, and a bird photographed on October 10, 2001 at Lake Olomega which was probably blown there by a storm. Hurricanes can also devastate small breeding colonies, as has been surmised for example for the sooty tern nesting sites on cays off the San Andrés Islands of Colombia.

An exceptionally common bird, the sooty tern is not considered threatened by the IUCN.

== In culture ==
Colloquially, it is sometimes known as &quot;wideawake&quot; or &quot;wideawake tern&quot;; an onomatopoeic name derived from its call &#x27;wide-a-wake&#x27;, as is the Hawaiian name &quot;ʻewa ʻewa&quot; which roughly means &quot;cacophony&quot;. In most of Polynesia its name is &quot;manutara&quot; or similar, literally &quot;tern-bird&quot;, though it might be better rendered in English as &quot;the tern&quot; or &quot;common tern&quot;. This refers to the fact that wherever Polynesian seafarers went on their long voyages, they usually would find these birds in astounding numbers. It is also known as &quot;kaveka&quot; in the Marquesas Islands, where dishes using its eggs are a delicacy.

On Easter Island, this species and the spectacled tern (&quot;O. lunatus&quot;) are collectively known as &quot;manutara&quot;. The &quot;manutara&quot; played an important role in the &quot;tangata manu&quot; (&quot;birdman&quot;) ritual: whichever &quot;hopu&quot; (champion) could retrieve the first &quot;manutara&quot; egg from Motu Nui islet would become that year&#x27;s &quot;tangata manu&quot;; his clan would receive prime access to resources, especially seabird eggs.

<text>Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) was a public university in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Founded in 1964, IPFW was a cooperatively managed regional campus of two state university systems: Indiana University and Purdue University. IPFW hit its highest enrollment in 2014, with 13,459 undergraduate and postgraduate students in nine colleges and schools, including a branch of the Indiana University School of Medicine. During its last academic year (2017–2018), IPFW had a total enrollment of 10,414 students. IPFW offered more than 200 graduate and undergraduate degree programs through IU or Purdue universities. The university&#x27;s 14 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletic teams competed in Division I of the NCAA Summit League.

On July 1, 2018, the two universities parted company in Fort Wayne. The health sciences programs on the campus became Indiana University Fort Wayne, and the other programs became Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW). About two weeks before the split took effect, the athletic program, which was inherited solely by PFW, changed its branding from Fort Wayne Mastodons to Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons.

== History ==

In 1917, Indiana University started offering courses in downtown Fort Wayne to 142 students in 12 courses. At a separate downtown location, Purdue University permanently established the Purdue University Center in 1941 to provide a site in Fort Wayne for students to begin their undergraduate studies prior to transferring to the West Lafayette main campus to complete their degree.

Under the direction of Purdue University President Frederick Hovde, Indiana University President Herman Wells, IU trustee John Hastings, and Purdue trustee Alfred Kettler Sr., the Indiana University and Purdue University extension centers began merging in 1958 via the formation of the Indiana–Purdue Foundation. To serve the extension centers&#x27; now combined mission in Fort Wayne, the Indiana–Purdue Foundation acquired a 99-year lease on agricultural land owned by Allen County to form a campus totaling at the then-suburban northeast edge of Fort Wayne on the eastern bank of the St. Joseph River. Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne opened on September 17, 1964, following nearly two years of construction that began on October 18, 1962. The first all-inclusive building on campus was known as the Education Building, but it has since been renamed Kettler Hall in honor of the combined university&#x27;s chief advocate. Kettler&#x27;s vision and passion during the 1950s made IPFW possible. IPFW awarded its first four-year degree in 1968 after awarding two-year degrees through the IU and Purdue Fort Wayne extension centers prior to the formation of the joint IPFW campus.

In the spirit of Indiana University&#x27;s 1967 acquisition of the Herron School of Art in Indianapolis, which helped form IUPUI two years later, the Indiana General Assembly approved a similar merger of the Fort Wayne Art Institute with IPFW in 1976. The Fort Wayne Art Institute was founded in 1897 as the Fort Wayne Art School. Until 1991, the Fort Wayne Art Institute and resulting academic unit within IPFW maintained a small campus in downtown Fort Wayne. In 1998, this academic unit was renamed the School of Fine and Performing Arts. During the late 1990s, the School of Fine and Performing Arts and its primary classroom building was renamed the School of Visual and Performing Arts and Visual and Performing Arts Building, respectively. In the mid-2000s, the Purdue University board of trustees granted the school &quot;college&quot; status, becoming the College of Visual and Performing Arts.

In 1988, a coalition of the then-Lincoln National Corporation under the direction of Ian Rolland, the M.E. Raker Foundation, the Olive B. Cole Foundation, and the Foellinger Foundation purchased an additional on the west bank of the St. Joseph River, known as the former McKay Family Farm. In 2007, the State of Indiana completed the process of closing the Fort Wayne State Developmental Center. A portion of the grounds had been transferred to IPFW years earlier for construction of the Northeast Indiana Innovation Center. The remaining property and buildings of the developmental center was transferred later in 2007, with the land split between IPFW () and Ivy Tech Community College ().

IPFW was divided into two universities on July 1, 2018: Purdue University Fort Wayne, and Indiana University Fort Wayne. The division moved all departments involved in health care to Indiana University Fort Wayne, and all others into Purdue University Fort Wayne. The split generated a moderate level of controversy, as the nursing program was formerly administered by the Purdue School of Nursing. This marked the second time Indiana University had taken over a Purdue healthcare-related institution (the other being Purdue&#x27;s school of medicine in 1908). The Philosophy and Geosciences departments were closed on January 1, 2017.

==Campus==

IPFW&#x27;s campus is , encompassing four main campus areas, including 40 buildings which cover . The Main Academic Campus, bounded by East Coliseum Boulevard (Indiana State Road 930) to the south, Crescent Avenue to the east, St. Joseph River to the west, and Canterbury Green Apartment complex and golf course to the north includes the majority of academic and administrative buildings and parking.

The Waterfield Student Housing Campus, bounded by Crescent Avenue to the west, East Coliseum Boulevard and Trier Road to the south, and Hobson Road to the East, contains all of the privately owned residence halls. The main academic campus and Waterfield campus are connected via the Crescent Avenue Pedestrian Bridge, elevated above Crescent Avenue.

The Research-Incubator Campus, bounded by St. Joe Road to the west, Stellhorn Road to the south, Dean Drive to the north, and Sirlin Drive to the east includes the Northeast Indiana Innovation Center, a business incubator for entrepreneurs. This area of the campus was acquired in 2007 after the Fort Wayne State Developmental Center&#x27;s closure, with the land donated between IPFW and Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana.

The former McKay Family Farm, located on the western bank of the St. Joseph River, is bounded by East Coliseum Boulevard to the south, St. Joseph River to the east, and development to the north and west. The Plex indoor soccer facility, Hefner Soccer Complex, Holiday Inn hotel and Steel Dynamics Keith E. Busse Alumni Center are located on this portion of the campus, connected to the main academic campus via the pedestrian-only Ron Venderly Family Bridge. The Holiday Inn operates on property leased from the Indiana–Purdue Foundation and is affiliated with IPFW&#x27;s Hospitality Management Program.

For three years a grant through the state of Indiana provided bus service between the student housing and the campus but as of 2015 that program was cancelled. Pedestrian and bicycling traffic are also accommodated through the university&#x27;s direct connection with the Fort Wayne Rivergreenway, a designated National Recreation Trail. The trail is part of the larger Fort Wayne Trail Network.

===Architecture===
IPFW buildings generally feature brick in various shades of brown or tan, a nod to the brick façades of Purdue University&#x27;s West Lafayette campus buildings. This contrasts with IPFW&#x27;s sibling university, Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, where the buildings generally feature Indiana limestone façades. The grounds at IPFW are manicured and landscaped as a multiple-hundred-acre park due in part to the generosity of Virginia Ayers, an avid long-time exerciser on campus who willed her estate to IPFW upon her death in 1986 (IPFW University Archives ).

===Satellite facilities===
IPFW operated a satellite facility in Warsaw, Indiana (about northwest of the main campus) from 2003 to 2013. IPFW Warsaw Center was closed due to improved distance learning technologies and increasing reliance on e-learning.

==Administration==
IPFW was governed in various ways via the Purdue University Board of Trustees, the Indiana University Board of Trustees, and the IPFW Faculty Senate. Purdue served as the fiscal agent for IPFW&#x27;s budget and substantially represented IPFW during budgetary negotiations with the Indiana General Assembly. The Indiana–Purdue Foundation owns most of the land that constitutes IPFW and has entered into a 99-year lease with Allen County for additional land for US$1. The IPFW Faculty Senate represented the faculty in the university&#x27;s shared governance model. The desire was so strong for an expansion of IPFW during the 1980s, the Faculty Senate and Indiana–Purdue Foundation explored full independence from both Purdue and IU, not entirely unlike the University of Southern Indiana&#x27;s independence from Indiana State University in 1985. Relations with Purdue later improved, as did the level of funding from the State of Indiana. IPFW was designated Indiana&#x27;s Multisystem Metropolitan University by the Indiana General Assembly in May 2015.

==Academics==
IPFW was selective, accepting 82.1 percent of applicants for the fall 2012 semester. The university had a student-to-teacher ratio of 17:1, with 51 percent of classes holding 20 or fewer students (2.9 percent had classes with 50 or more students).

Either Purdue or IU awarded IPFW&#x27;s degrees on a program-by-program basis. IPFW&#x27;s colleges, schools, and divisions were not each identified specifically as IU units or as Purdue units. Through an agreement between the IU and Purdue trustees, most of IPFW&#x27;s university services were administratively operated through Purdue&#x27;s processes. This is in contrast to IPFW&#x27;s sibling university, Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), where IUPUI is a core campus of the Indiana University System, where IUPUI&#x27;s university services are administratively operated through the Indiana University System, and where IUPUI&#x27;s schools and academic divisions are each strongly identified by name as IU or Purdue aligned.

===Student body===
As of 2014, IPFW enrolled 13,214 students, consisting of 12,674 undergraduate students and 540 postgraduate students. A slight majority of IPFW students were first-generation college students, at 51 percent. IPFW consisted of 55 percent female students and 45 percent male students.

===Library system===
The Walter E. Helmke Library, the only public university library in northeast Indiana, was dedicated in 1977 and covers . Ground was broken in 2009 for a new US$42.4 million Student Services Complex, extending the second floor Learning Commons through a glass-enclosed elevated walkway, connecting Helmke Library to Walb Student Union and Hilliard Gates Sports Center. In November 2011, the Student Services Complex and Learning Commons were opened for use. The Learning Commons includes librarian research consulting, the Writing Center, IT services computing, and areas for group and individual study.

Helmke houses nearly 1 million printed materials available to students, faculty, staff, and the general public. IPFW students, faculty and staff have 24/7 access to thousands of electronic books, journals and databases, the IU and WorldCat catalogs, and document delivery service. The mDON: mastodon Digital Object Network is a growing digital library of IPFW and local community resources. Special collections highlight photography, distinguished faculty lectures, athletics, and streaming video of the Omnibus Lecture Series. The open access IPFW repository Opus: Research &amp; Creativity at IPFW offers a portal to faculty, staff and student scholarly accomplishments as well as free downloads of many of the materials.

===Weekend supplementary education===
The IPFW Japanese Saturday School (JSS; フォートウェイン補習授業校 &quot;Fōtowein Hoshū Jugyō Kō&quot;), a weekend Japanese educational program designated by the Japanese Ministry of Education, was affiliated with IPFW and held its classes on the university campus. It was established in 2006.

==Student life==
===Housing===
IPFW was predominately a commuter school, with only six percent of the student body living in university-operated housing and 94 percent living off campus; 99 percent of students had cars on campus. Beginning with fall semester 2004, the university introduced student dormitories on the Waterfield Campus. Phase II of the student housing initiative continued with two more buildings in August 2007, with total student housing occupancy approaching nearly 750 residents. Phase III of the project, which opened in August 2010, added 448 beds divided between four new residence buildings, bringing total occupancy to more than 1,200 students. Another student community center, The Clubhouse, a larger version of the existing Cole Commons, and a maintenance facility were also added.

===Media===
&quot;The Communicator&quot; was IPFW&#x27;s student newspaper. College Access Television was operated by IPFW and was one of five educational-access television channels serving Fort Wayne and Allen County. CATV was available on Frontier Communications and Comcast cable systems and served as the higher education cable access channel and provided opportunities in higher education for area residents. The university leased a portion of its East Campus, at the East Coliseum Boulevard and Crescent Avenue intersection, to northeast Indiana&#x27;s PBS member station, WFWA-TV.

==Athletics==
The IPFW athletic program, known from 2016 to 2018 as the Fort Wayne Mastodons, competed as a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I school in The Summit League, and in the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association for men&#x27;s volleyball. The university participated in 14 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports. Before joining NCAA Division I athletics, IPFW competed in the Great Lakes Valley Conference in NCAA Division II. Following the division of IPFW into separate Purdue and IU universities, the athletic program was rebranded as the Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons. The program is now a member of the Horizon League, having moved from the Summit League in July 2020.

==Community health programs==
The Northeast Indiana Area Health Education Center is a collaboration among the former IPFW College of Health and Human Services, Indiana Area Health Education Center Program office, Indiana University School of Medicine–Fort Wayne, Allen County Health Disparity Coalition, the Dr. Jeff Towles Health Disparities Initiative, and other community healthcare providers and schools serving 19 counties in northeast and east central Indiana. IPFW&#x27;s role in this collaboration has been inherited by IU Fort Wayne.

The Lafayette Street Family Health Clinic is a nurse-practitioner clinic that family planning services to low-income women and men. The clinic offers most birth control methods, pap smears for cervical cancer screening, pregnancy tests, clinical breast exams, emergency contraception, testing and treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), HIV counseling and testing, and education on reproductive health. The clinic also serves as a remote site for the IUFW Dental Clinic (formerly IPFW Dental Clinic). The on-campus IUFW Dental Clinic offers cleanings, fluoride treatments, and dental sealants, plus full-mouth, bite-wing, and X-rays for the community.

==Events==

===Omnibus Lecture Series===
IPFW&#x27;s Omnibus Lecture Series presented diverse ideas through speakers to the university community and the residents of northeast Indiana. Featured presenters included Henry Winkler, Marlee Matlin, Cheech Marin, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Betty Friedan, James Earl Jones, Jeb Bush, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Ralph Nader, Joyce Carol Oates, Deepak Chopra, Gail Sheehy, Hal Holbrook, Sandra Day O’Connor, and Sean Astin.

===Tapestry: A Day for You===
Tapestry: A Day for You hosts guest speakers and conducts break-out sessions that are mindful of women&#x27;s empowerment at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum. Tapestry proceeds support the Tapestry Parkview Endowment Fund and the Tapestry gift account and provide scholarships to students studying health sciences at IPFW. Since its beginning in 2002, Tapestry has raised more than $675,000 in scholarship funds and awarded 50 scholarships. Featured keynote speakers have included Dana Reeve, Linda Ellerbee, Patty Duke, Marie Osmond, and Clinton Kelly.

===Northeast Indiana Defense Industry Mega Conference===
The NorthEast Indiana Defense Industry Mega Conference (NIDIA) is the largest annual defense-industry conference in the U.S. Midwest. Cybersecurity expert Walter O&#x27;Brien was its keynote speaker in 2015.

<doc id="391618" wikidata="Q979266" url="?curid=391618" title="Saturn I SA-5">
<text>Saturn-Apollo 5 (SA-5) was the first launch of the Block II Saturn I rocket and was part of the Apollo program. In 1963, President Kennedy identified this launch as the one which would place US lift capability ahead of the Soviets, after being behind for more than six years since Sputnik.

==Upgrades and objectives==
The major changes that occurred on SA-5 were that for the first time the Saturn I would fly with two stages - the S-I first stage and the S-IV second stage. The second stage featured six engines burning liquid hydrogen. Although this engine design (RL10) was meant to be tested several years earlier in the Centaur upper stage, in the end the first Centaur was launched only two months before SA-5. This rocket stage was delivered to the Cape by a modified B-377 aircraft, the &quot;Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy&quot;.

Other major design change included the enlargement of the fuel tanks on the first stage. For the first time the rocket would carry its planned 750,000 lb (340,000 kg) of propellant and would use eight upgraded engines producing a thrust each of 188,000 lbf (836 kN). The first stage also featured for the first time eight fins for added stability during flight. As with the earlier flight the rocket would still carry only a Jupiter nosecone instead of a boilerplate Apollo spacecraft.

Also the guidance and control computer on the rocket was positioned above the second stage. This was where it would be located on Saturn V flights. The Instrument Unit controlled the ascent of the rocket through the atmosphere, automatically compensating for any winds or loss of thrust during the ascent.

For the first time in the Apollo program, this flight would be an orbital mission. This was possible because of the upgraded first stage and the addition of the second stage. It would enter into an elliptical orbit and re-enter later as its orbit decayed.

President Kennedy referred specifically to this launch in a speech at Brooks AFB in San Antonio, Texas, on November 21, 1963, the day before he was assassinated. He said:
:And in December, while I do not regard our mastery of space as anywhere near complete, while I recognize that there are still areas where we are behind – at least in one area, the size of the booster – this year I hope the United States will be ahead.

==Flight==

The first scheduled launch attempt was for 27 January 1964, with all going well until 93% of the liquid oxygen (LOX) had been loaded into the first stage. At this time, the ground crews switched it from a fast fill to a replenish system. However, the LOX in the tanks began to fall, i.e., it was not being replenished. The cause was found to be a blind flange (a plate without an opening) in the line. This could not be removed easily and the launch had to be postponed for two days.

The second launch attempt had no such problems and lifted off into overcast skies at January 29, 1964, 11:25 EST. The rocket sent back 1,183 measurements to the ground during the flight while at the same time it was tracked by six telescopes. For the first 1000 meters the rocket was filmed by 13 cameras that looked for any pitch, yaw, and roll movements.

The separation of the two rocket stages was filmed by eight cameras that themselves separated from the rocket to be recovered downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. The whole stage separation system worked perfectly with the retrorockets firing on the first stage to decelerate it and ullage rockets on the S-IV firing to settle its fuel to aft of the stage.

After an eight-minute burn, the second stage entered into a orbit. At 16,965 kg (37,401 lb) it was the largest satellite ever to go into orbit at that time. However, the achievement of Earth orbit was not an objective of the mission but merely a bonus. It did show to the American public that the United States could build launch vehicles as large as those of the Soviet Union.

<text>&quot;Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty&quot; is the national anthem of Uganda. George Wilberforce Kakoma composed the music and authored the lyrics. It was adopted as the national anthem in 1962, when the country gained independence from the United Kingdom. It is musically one of the shortest national anthems in the world. Consequently, multiple verses are sung when it is performed in public.

==History==
From 1894 until the height of decolonisation during the 1960s, Uganda was a protectorate of the United Kingdom within its colonial empire. In the run up to independence, a subcommittee was formed to determine an anthem for the forthcoming state. It proceeded to hold a nationwide contest, with the criteria they stipulated for the anthem being that it should be &quot;short, original, solemn, praising and looking forward to the future&quot;.

In the end, the lyrics and tune composed by George Wilberforce Kakoma were selected in July 1962. He wrote the anthem in one day, having listened on Radio Uganda the night before about how none of the entries received so far had been deemed suitable by the subcommittee. His entry was one of four that was shortlisted. The song was officially adopted in 1962, the year the country gained independence. The first public occasion where the anthem was played was at the celebrations marking independence on 9 October 1962.

Kakoma subsequently sued the government in 2008, claiming that he was never adequately remunerated and thus had rights to over four decades of royalty payments. He alleged that the government gave him a mere USh.2,000/=, equivalent to less than £1 in 2008, as a &quot;token of thanks&quot;. Kakoma died before the country&#x27;s Court of Appeal dismissed the case in 2019, finding that the anthem&#x27;s copyright vested in the government and not the author.

==Lyrics==
===In national languages===
===In local languages===

Along with the Luganda and Swahili translations, the national anthem has also been translated into several other local languages.

==Composition==
At only eight bars long, &quot;Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty&quot; is musically one of the shortest national anthems in the world, together with Japan&#x27;s anthem. Both Michael Bristow, the editor of the book &quot;National Anthems of the World&quot;, and Philip Sheppard have identified Uganda&#x27;s national anthem as the shortest. As a result, multiple verses are typically sung when it is performed at public events like international football games.

<text>Robert Faurisson (; born Robert Faurisson Aitken; 25 January 1929 – 21 October 2018) was a British-born French academic who became best known for Holocaust denial. Faurisson generated much controversy with several articles published in the &quot;Journal of Historical Review&quot; and elsewhere, and by letters to French newspapers, especially &quot;Le Monde&quot;, which contradicted the history of the Holocaust by denying the existence of gas chambers in Nazi death camps, the systematic killing of European Jews using gas during the Second World War, and the authenticity of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;. After the passing of the Gayssot Act against Holocaust denial in 1990, Faurisson was prosecuted and fined, and in 1991 he was dismissed from his academic post.

Faurisson is believed to be one of seven children born in Shepperton, Middlesex, England to a French father and a Scottish mother.

He studied French, Latin and Greek literature (&quot;Lettres classiques&quot;), and passed the agrégation (the highest competitive examination to qualify to be a secondary school teacher) in 1956. He became a high school teacher at Vichy. 

In Vichy, as a young teacher, he gained attention when he published an interpretation of Rimbaud&#x27;s &quot;Sonnet des voyelles&quot; as an erotic text. Around 1960, he developed political sympathies for the colonialist cause in Algeria (the &quot;Algérie française&quot; movement), and was arrested in the belief he was a member of the &quot;OAS&quot;, a terrorist organisation.

While teaching, he worked on a PhD thesis about the poet Lautréamont. He obtained his doctorate in 1972. The methodology of Faurisson was challenged during the defense of his thesis. The president of the jury, Jacques Robichez, declared: &quot;Finally, I point out […] to the candidate that the method of reading the text as it is written; systematically ignoring the context, not taking into account the historical environment reflected by the language, is an unsustainable bias&quot;. In a 2021 book, the historian Stephanie Courouble-Share said that Faurisson&#x27;s &quot;literary method&quot; would be repeated later when he wrote about the gas chambers. Faurisson became a lecturer, and then professor of French literature at the University of Lyon in 1973.

==Holocaust denial==
In 1974, Faurisson contacted Yad Vashem with a lengthy letter detailing a variety of arguments which he claimed demonstrated that there had been no genocide of Jews during World War II. These assertions were based on his own interpretation of archival records and his skepticism about the assertions and testimony of various historical figures, including Nazi officials such as Rudolf Höss.

He became involved with the Institute for Historical Review during the 1970s, lecturing and publishing prolifically. He gave a lecture at the headquarters of the National Alliance (the American neo-Nazi party) outside of Washington, on September 14, 1979. He twice testified in defense of Canadian-German Holocaust denier and Neo-Nazi Ernst Zündel, and his testimony has been associated with laying the groundwork for the &quot;Leuchter Report&quot;, an influential Holocaust-denial publication. Faurisson&#x27;s activism garnered him several dedicated critics, including the Jewish French historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet.

===&quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;===
In 1978, Faurisson authored a French-language text, &quot;&quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; Is It Authentic?&quot;. It appeared in Dutch-language translation in 1985, with the modified title, &quot;&quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; A Forgery&quot;. The text questioned the credibility of various elements in &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;.

The website of the historian Deborah Lipstadt, Holocaust Denial on Trial, argues that Faurisson&#x27;s treatise ignored details within Anne Frank&#x27;s account that explain the aspects he deemed implausible, as well as observable details within the Anne Frank House.

Faurisson interviewed Otto Frank in researching the piece, though much of what Faurisson asserted Frank had said was later contradicted by Frank himself. Faurisson&#x27;s writing on the subject first came into the spotlight during a court case between Otto Frank and Heinz Roth, a publishing-house owner responsible for the circulation of various neo-Nazi writings, including several publications impugning the authenticity of Anne Frank&#x27;s diary; Faurisson&#x27;s writing on the subject was entered into the court record as an expert opinion in defense of Roth. The 1978 finding of the court was that Roth must refrain from publishing any further reading material claiming the diary was a fraud.

===Faurisson affair===

During the Faurisson affair (1978-1979), the university administration suggested distance learning for Faurisson, although he was still attached to the university. In 1984, the president of the university forbade him to use the university letterhead in his private correspondence.

One of Faurisson&#x27;s works, &quot;Mémoire en défense&quot;, was published in 1980, prefaced by an essay by Noam Chomsky. While Chomsky had given general approval for his essay to be reproduced by others, it was included without his knowledge. Chomsky&#x27;s piece was a general defense of freedom of speech, including that of Faurisson. Chomsky stated that &quot;I see no anti-Semitic implications in denial of the existence of gas chambers, or even denial of the Holocaust...I see no hint of anti-Semitic implications in Faurisson&#x27;s work,&quot; and considered Faurisson as a &quot;relatively apolitical liberal of some sort&quot;. Chomsky was accused of supporting Faurisson, rather than defending his right to free speech, which Chomsky denied. Noting that he had described the Holocaust as &quot;the most fantastic outburst of collective insanity in human history&quot;, Chomsky argued that his views were &quot;diametrically opposed&quot; to those of Faurisson on the subject.

===Legal and other consequences===
Faurisson was fined by a French court in 1983, for having declared that &quot;Hitler never ordered nor permitted that anyone be killed by reason of his race or religion.&quot;

In September 1989, Faurisson was beaten by unknown assailants claiming to be &quot;The Sons of the Memory of the Jews&quot;, an organization about which nothing has been discovered either before or since the incident. Faurisson had been walking his dog in a park in Vichy and was kicked and punched by three young men, breaking his jaw.

Shortly after the Gayssot Act—a statute that prohibited Holocaust denial—was enacted in 1990, Faurisson was convicted of Holocaust denial in a French court. In 1991, Faurisson was removed from his university chair under the Gayssot Act on the basis of his denialist views. He challenged the statute as a violation of international law, specifically the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, at the Human Rights Committee. Faurisson filed a complaint with the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 1993; in 1996, the Committee rejected Faurisson&#x27;s claim that France&#x27;s prosecution of him was a violation of the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee upheld the Gayssot Act as &quot;serv[ing] the respect of the Jewish community to live free from fear of an atmosphere of anti-semitism&quot; and necessary &quot;to serve the struggle against racism and anti-semitism&quot;.

He challenged the statute as Faurisson was charged again in a trial on 11 July 2006. He was accused of denying the Holocaust in an interview with the Iranian television station &quot;Sahar 1&quot; in February 2005. On 3 October 2006, he was given a three-month probationary sentence and fined €7,500 for this offence.

===Later life===
In December 2006, Faurisson gave a speech at the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, which was sponsored by the government of Iran.

Beginning in late 2008, Faurisson became close to the comedian and political activist Dieudonné M&#x27;bala M&#x27;bala, appearing with him publicly on stage and in video, and celebrating Faurisson&#x27;s 80th birthday in his theater. Dieudonné awarded Robert Faurisson an &quot;insolent outcast&quot; prize. The award was presented by one of Dieudonné&#x27;s assistants, Jacky, dressed in a concentration camp uniform with a yellow badge. This earned Dieudonné a court conviction.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad granted Faurisson an award for courage in Tehran, Iran on 2 February 2012.
