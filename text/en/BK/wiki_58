<text>Tornio (; ; ; ) is a city and municipality in Lapland, Finland. The city forms a cross-border twin city together with Haparanda on the Swedish side. The municipality covers an area of , of which is water. The population density is , with a total population of ().

Tornio is unilingually Finnish with a negligible number of native Swedish speakers, although this does not count vast numbers of bilinguals who speak Swedish as a second language, with an official target of universal working bilingualism for both border municipalities.

== History ==

The delta of the Torne River has been inhabited since the end of the last ice age, and there are currently (1995) 16 settlement sites known in the area, similar to those found in Vuollerim (). The Swedish part of the region is not far from the oldest permanent settlement site found in Scandinavia. A former hypothesis that this region was uninhabited and colonised from the Viking Age onward has now been abandoned.

Until the 19th century, inhabitants of the surrounding countryside spoke Finnish, and Kemi Sámi, a language of the Eastern Sami group, while those of the town were mainly Swedish-speaking.

The name &#x27;Tornio&#x27; is an old Finnish word meaning &quot;war spear&quot;: the city is named after the river. To Swedish it was borrowed as &quot;Torneå&quot; after &quot;Torne å&quot;, an alternative name of the river.

The town received its charter from the King Gustavus Adolphus on 12 May 1621, and was officially founded on the island of Suensaari. At that time, it was the northernmost city in the world. The charter was granted in recognition of Tornio being the hub of all trade in Lapland throughout the 16th century. It was the largest merchant town in the North at the time, and for some years ranked as the richest town in Sweden. Despite the lively trade with Lapland and overseas, the population of the town remained stable for hundreds of years at little over 500.

During the 18th century Tornio was visited by several expeditions from Central Europe which came to explore the Arctic. The most notable expedition (1736–1737) was led by a member of the Académie française, Pierre Louis Maupertuis, who came to take meridian arc measurements along the Meänmaa which would show that the globe is flattened towards the poles. The church spire at Tornio was one of the landmarks used by Maupertuis in his measurements. The church was constructed in 1686 by Matti Joosepinpoika Härmä.

The Lapland trade on which Tornio depended started to decline in the 18th century, and the harbour had to be moved downriver twice as a result of the rising of the land, which made the river too shallow for navigation. However, the greatest blow to the wealth of the town came in the last war between Sweden and Russia in 1808, which saw the Russians capture and annex Finland. The border was drawn through the deepest channel of the Muonio and Tornio rivers, splitting Lapland into two parts, with deleterious effects on trade. Tornio ended up on the Russian side of the border by special request of the Russian czar. The Swedes developed the village of Haaparanta (present day Haparanda) on their side of the border, to balance the loss of Tornio, and Tornio became unilingually Finnish.
During the Russian period, Tornio was a sleepy garrison town. Trade only livened up during the Åland War (part of the Crimean War) and the First World War, when Tornio became an important border crossing for goods and people. During the First World War, Tornio and Haparanda had the only rail link connecting the Russians to their Western allies. It was also through Tornio that Vladimir Lenin returned to Russia from exile in Switzerland in March 1917.

After the independence of Finland in 1917 Tornio lost its garrison and experienced further decline, although its population increased steadily. The town played no role of importance in the Finnish Civil War, but was the scene of some fierce street fighting at the onset of the Lapland War between Finland and Nazi Germany. The rapid liberation of the town by Finnish forces may have saved it from being burned down like so many other towns in Lapland. As a result, the wooden church from 1686 can still be seen today.

After World War II, the town created new employment built on the success of the local Lapin Kulta brewery and the Outokumpu stainless steel mill. Tourism based on the border has also been a growing industry. The town is a centre of education for Western Lapland, with a vocational college and a university of applied sciences.

Tornio and Haparanda have a history as twin cities, and are currently set to merge under the names TornioHaparanda and HaparandaTornio. A new city centre is under construction on the international border and several municipal services are shared. The towns also share a common golf course, situated astride the border. The IKEA store in Haparanda has signposting in Finnish as well as in Swedish, and all prices are signposted in two currencies.

==Sports==

Tornion Palloveikot is a bandy club which plays in the Bandyliiga and has become Finnish bandy champion several times. They play their home matches in Haparanda, just on the other side of the Swedish border, which was the venue for games at the 2001 Bandy World Championship.

Kemi-Tornio Airport is located in Kemi, about south-east from Tornio city centre.

The Port of Tornio is a cargo port adjacent to the Outokumpu steelworks.

Highway 29 (part of the European route E8) between Keminmaa and Tornio is the world&#x27;s northernmost motorway. Tornio is also the northern terminus of European route E4.

<doc id="384566" wikidata="Q4904575" url="?curid=384566" title="Flight review">
<text>A flight review is a study program and flight instructor examination of aviation piloting skills. Periodic flight reviews are a pilot licensing requirement mandated by the aviation authorities of many countries. These reviews take different forms in different countries.

== Flight reviews in the United States ==
In the United States, flight reviews are required every two years, and thus were formerly called biennial flight reviews (BFRs).

For holders of pilot certificates issued by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a flight review is required of every active holder of a U.S. pilot certificate at least every two years. The flight review consists of at least 1 hour of ground instruction and 1 hour in-flight with a qualified flight instructor, although completion of any Phase of the FAA WINGS program also satisfies the requirement for a flight review.

Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 61.56 specifies that the review must include:
# A review of the current general operating and flight rules of part 91 of the FAR; and
# A review of those maneuvers and procedures that, at the discretion of the person giving the review, are necessary for the pilot to demonstrate the safe exercise of the privileges of the pilot certificate.

Before being able to act as pilot in command (PIC) in the United States, a pilot must have completed a flight review within the previous 24 calendar months. The FAA and instructors are quick to point out that it is not a pass/fail or graded test. There are no pass or fail criteria, although the instructor giving it can decline to endorse the pilot&#x27;s log book to certify that a flight review has been completed.

A flight test (administered by an FAA representative Designated Pilot Examiner) that leads to a new certificate or rating may be substituted for the flight review. A proficiency check conducted by a Certified Flight Instructor for an additional Sport Pilot privilege may also be substituted for a flight review.

Completion of a proficiency check administered by a check pilot (typically air carrier pilots) can also be used.

<doc id="384572" wikidata="Q2299865" url="?curid=384572" title="Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen">
<text>Ilmarinen was a Finnish Navy &quot;Panssarilaiva&quot;, Swedish &quot;Pansarskepp&quot; (&quot;Armored ship&quot;; a coastal defence ship by British classification). The unit was constructed at the Crichton-Vulcan shipyard in Turku, Finland, and named after the mythological hero Ilmarinen from the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala. &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; was the flagship of the Navy from 1 May 1933 until her sinking on 13 September 1941.

==History==

During the early inter-war period the Finnish Navy consisted of some 30 ex-Russian vessels, most of them taken as war-trophies following the civil war. Never ideal types for the navy&#x27;s needs, they were generally old and in poor condition. In 1925, a tragic incident highlighted the sorry state of the navy. An old torpedo boat was lost in a fierce storm, taking with her the entire crew of 53. A heated debate started, and intensive lobbying led to the adoption of a new Finnish Navy Act in 1927.

Prior to World War II, the fleet renewal program led to the acquisition or construction of five submarines, four torpedo boats, and two coastal defense ships. Among the last of their kind, and &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; were two of the most concentrated naval artillery units ever built. They were designed by the Dutch company NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (a front for German interests circumventing the Treaty of Versailles), and were optimized for operations in the archipelagos of the Baltic Sea. Their open sea performance was de-emphasized in order to give the vessels their shallow draft and super-compact design.

Coastal defence ships were particularly popular in the Nordic countries, and began serving in the navies of Denmark, Sweden and Norway early in the 20th century. These vessels typically had heavy armament and good armor protection, but were relatively slow. Their sizes were around 4,000 tons, main armament consisted of guns between , the armor corresponded to that of armoured cruisers, and speeds were between . A coastal defence ship was somewhere between a cruiser and a monitor: slower than a cruiser but better armed, faster than a monitor, but with smaller guns. The coastal defence ships also varied among themselves; some of them were closer to cruisers, and others, such as the Finnish ones, were closer to monitors.

Being the second of her class, &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; was launched at the Turku shipyard on 9 September 1933. The ship went through its finishing trials and was handed over to the Finnish Navy on 17 April 1934. Her sister ship &quot;Väinämöinen&quot; had preceded her by two years.

The vessels had a compact design, with a high mast and large turrets for main and secondary artillery. Foreign comments on their design ranged from puns to praise. Not truly designed for open sea operations, the ships had a tendency to roll slowly and widely even in moderate seas. Travel on them was unpleasant, but deemed safe. Additional keels were later fitted, which improved the situation somewhat.

&quot;Väinämöinen&quot; and &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; had a displacement of 3,900 long tons, a maximum length of , and a draught of .
Requirements of speed and range were moderate, as they were expected to operate near their home bases. Both vessels were equipped with four diesel engines that powered two electrical engines. These generated a total of . There were also two smaller auxiliary diesel engines. Maximum speed was , and range was limited by the vessels&#x27; carrying capacity of only 93 tonnes of diesel oil.

The four Bofors guns were massive for vessels of this size, and they could hurl a shell up to . The secondary artillery consisted of eight dual-purpose Bofors guns in four turrets. These were the primary defense against fast torpedo boats and aircraft. Additionally, the ships were equipped with four 40 mm anti-aircraft guns (initially British-made &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns, which, after mediocre performance in the Winter War, were replaced with Bofors guns) and two Madsen 20 mm cannons (later increased to eight).

The purpose of the coastal defence ships was to prevent landing operations and naval blockades that threatened vital sea trade. Thanks to the construction of vast defensive systems during the czarist era, Finland had strong coastal artillery in permanent positions. These defenses were to be supplemented with minefields in times of unrest. One of the main purposes of the navy was to buy time for ground forces to deploy to the islands in the Archipelago. In these confined spaces, coastal defence ships armed with 254 mm main artillery would have been a tough opponent for any ship of the era.

The Soviet Baltic Fleet was the obvious threat, and the Finnish vessels were meant to deter the largest Soviet ships, such as the battleships &quot;Marat&quot; and &quot;Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya&quot;, as well as the cruiser , from venturing too close to Finnish shores.

==Operational history==
During her first years &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; made a few journeys to different ports in Finland, once running aground near Vaasa.

When the Winter War erupted, &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; and her sister ship were dispatched to Åland in order to guard against a possible invasion. Due to a decree by the League of Nations, the Ålands were to be demilitarized in peacetime. The Finnish Navy was to transfer resources there when conflict arose.

The threat against the Åland Islands receded after thick sheet-ice began covering the Baltic Sea in December 1939. The two coastal defence ships sailed to Turku where they provided anti-aircraft support for the city. They were painted white to prevent Soviet bomber crews from spotting them, but were targeted by aircraft on several occasions, resulting in one death and several injuries.

During the Continuation War the two ships shelled the Soviet base at Hanko Peninsula on five occasions in July–November 1941. &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; fired twenty shells at the Soviet airfield at Täcktom on 12 July 1941. The airfield had previously been bombed by German Junkers Ju 88s of &quot;Küstenfliegergruppe&quot; 806.
The two Finnish coastal defence ship participated in Operation Nordwind on 13 September 1941, in which German forces were to take the Estonian islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa. A group of Finnish and German ships were to be used in a diversionary operation to lure the Soviet fleet into battle – away from the real invasion force coming up from the south. Another German fleet, including the cruisers , , and , waited further away to join the battle if the Soviets turned up; however, the northern fleet remained unnoticed and an order was given to turn around when they had reached a point some south of Utö. The formation was led by minesweepers, but some mines had escaped being swept. The crew of &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; failed to take proper notice of the dragging paravane cable. It is likely that the ship had caught one or two sea mines in the paravane, and when the ship turned, the mines struck the bottom of the hull and exploded. The explosion blew a large hole in the ship, which soon developed a strong list and keeled over. The ship sank in just seven minutes. Only 132 men of the crew survived, and 271 were lost, most of them trapped inside the hull. Fifty-seven were rescued by the patrol boat &quot;VMV 1&quot;, which had maneuvered to the capsized hull and took on as many of &quot;Ilmarinen&quot;″s crew as she could. During this time she too was at great risk of being obliterated if &quot;Ilmarinen&quot;″s magazines had ignited.

The survivors were later known as &quot;Ilmarisen uimaseura&quot; (Ilmarinen&#x27;s Swimming Club). Among the survivors were &quot;Ilmarinen&quot;″s captain, Commander Ragnar Göransson, and the Commander of the Finnish Navy, Commodore Eero Rahola, as well as Lieutenant Viljo Revell, later a renowned architect.

The loss of &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; is the greatest single loss of the Finnish Navy to date. The military command tried to keep the loss secret, but Swedish newspapers soon reported the incident, and the numerous sailor obituaries in Finnish newspapers could also have alerted the Soviets, who soon also reported the loss.

The ship was located in 1990. It was found upside-down, deeply embedded in mud, resting at a depth of . It is classified as a war grave. The wreck of is some away.

<text>In mathematics, the arithmetic of abelian varieties is the study of the number theory of an abelian variety, or a family of abelian varieties. It goes back to the studies of Pierre de Fermat on what are now recognized as elliptic curves; and has become a very substantial area of arithmetic geometry both in terms of results and conjectures. Most of these can be posed for an abelian variety &quot;A&quot; over a number field &quot;K&quot;; or more generally (for global fields or more general finitely-generated rings or fields).

==Integer points on abelian varieties==
There is some tension here between concepts: &quot;integer point&quot; belongs in a sense to affine geometry, while &quot;abelian variety&quot; is inherently defined in projective geometry. The basic results, such as Siegel&#x27;s theorem on integral points, come from the theory of diophantine approximation.

==Rational points on abelian varieties==
The basic result, the Mordell–Weil theorem in Diophantine geometry, says that &quot;A&quot;(&quot;K&quot;), the group of points on &quot;A&quot; over &quot;K&quot;, is a finitely-generated abelian group. A great deal of information about its possible torsion subgroups is known, at least when &quot;A&quot; is an elliptic curve. The question of the &quot;rank&quot; is thought to be bound up with L-functions (see below).

The torsor theory here leads to the Selmer group and Tate–Shafarevich group, the latter (conjecturally finite) being difficult to study.

==Heights==

The theory of heights plays a prominent role in the arithmetic of abelian varieties. For instance, the canonical Néron–Tate height is a quadratic form with remarkable properties that appear in the statement of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

==Reduction mod &quot;p&quot;==
Reduction of an abelian variety &quot;A&quot; modulo a prime ideal of (the integers of) &quot;K&quot; — say, a prime number &quot;p&quot; — to get an abelian variety &quot;Ap&quot; over a finite field, is possible for almost all &quot;p&quot;. The &#x27;bad&#x27; primes, for which the reduction degenerates by acquiring singular points, are known to reveal very interesting information. As often happens in number theory, the &#x27;bad&#x27; primes play a rather active role in the theory.

Here a refined theory of (in effect) a right adjoint to reduction mod &quot;p&quot; — the Néron model — cannot always be avoided. In the case of an elliptic curve there is an algorithm of John Tate describing it.

==L-functions==

For abelian varieties such as A&quot;p&quot;, there is a definition of local zeta-function available. To get an L-function for A itself, one takes a suitable Euler product of such local functions; to understand the finite number of factors for the &#x27;bad&#x27; primes one has to refer to the Tate module of A, which is (dual to) the étale cohomology group H1(A), and the Galois group action on it. In this way one gets a respectable definition of Hasse–Weil L-function for A. In general its properties, such as functional equation, are still conjectural – the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (which was proven in 2001) was just a special case, so that&#x27;s hardly surprising.

It is in terms of this L-function that the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer is posed. It is just one particularly interesting aspect of the general theory about values of L-functions L(&quot;s&quot;) at integer values of &quot;s&quot;, and there is much empirical evidence supporting it.

==Complex multiplication==

Since the time of Carl Friedrich Gauss (who knew of the &quot;lemniscate function&quot; case) the special role has been known of those abelian varieties formula_1 with extra automorphisms, and more generally endomorphisms. In terms of the ring formula_2, there is a definition of abelian variety of CM-type that singles out the richest class. These are special in their arithmetic. This is seen in their L-functions in rather favourable terms – the harmonic analysis required is all of the Pontryagin duality type, rather than needing more general automorphic representations. That reflects a good understanding of their Tate modules as Galois modules. It also makes them &quot;harder&quot; to deal with in terms of the conjectural algebraic geometry (Hodge conjecture and Tate conjecture). In those problems the special situation is more demanding than the general.

In the case of elliptic curves, the Kronecker Jugendtraum was the programme Leopold Kronecker proposed, to use elliptic curves of CM-type to do class field theory explicitly for imaginary quadratic fields – in the way that roots of unity allow one to do this for the field of rational numbers. This generalises, but in some sense with loss of explicit information (as is typical of several complex variables).

==Manin–Mumford conjecture==

The Manin–Mumford conjecture of Yuri Manin and David Mumford, proved by Michel Raynaud, states that a curve &quot;C&quot; in its Jacobian variety &quot;J&quot; can only contain a finite number of points that are of finite order (a torsion point) in &quot;J&quot;, unless &quot;C&quot; = &quot;J&quot;. There are other more general versions, such as the Bogomolov conjecture which generalizes the statement to non-torsion points.

<text>Stanislaw Pawel Stefan Jan Sebastian Skrowaczewski (; October 3, 1923 – February 21, 2017) was a Polish-American classical conductor and composer.

==Biography==
Skrowaczewski was born in Lwów, Second Polish Republic (now Lviv, Ukraine). His parents were Paweł and Zofia (Karszniewicz) Skrowaczewski. His mother, an amateur pianist, began giving him lessons at the age of four, and he composed his first symphony by age eight. The Lwów Philharmonic performed one of his symphonies that same year. He gave his first piano recital at age eleven, and then, at age thirteen, he conducted and was the soloist in Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 in C minor. He gave up any thought of pursuing a career as a soloist when, after a German bombing raid in June 1941, he suffered two broken hands and was also left with nerve damage.

During the German occupation, Skrowaczewski worked as a bricklayer, and he studied physics, chemistry and philosophy at the University of Lwów. He then pursued training at the Lwów Conservatory, and then the Academy of Music in Kraków (in the composition class of Roman Palester and conducting class of ). He became the principal conductor of the Wrocław Philharmonic (1946-1947), then the Katowice Philharmonic (1949-1954), the Kraków Philharmonic (1954-1956), and finally the Warsaw National Orchestra (1956-1959). He studied composition with Nadia Boulanger and conducting with Paul Kletzki in Paris. He co-founded the avant-garde Groupe Zodiaque with Maurice Ohana. In 1956 he won the Santa Cecilia Competition for Conductors.

While the Cleveland Orchestra was giving a concert in Warsaw in 1957, their music director, George Szell, invited Skrowaczewski to make his American debut the following year. He guest-conducted in Cleveland again in 1959, where he gave the US debut of his &quot;Symphony for Strings&quot;, and then, in 1960, for Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and the New York Philharmonic.

He and his wife defected from Poland to the United States in 1960, via Amsterdam, after he was offered the post of music director of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (later renamed the Minnesota Orchestra under his tenure in 1968), a position he held until 1979 when he became conductor laureate. In 1981 the American Composers Forum (then known as the Minnesota Composers Forum) commissioned the Clarinet Concerto which Skrowaczewski wrote for Minnesota Orchestra principal clarinetist Joe Longo, who premiered it in 1981. While in Minnesota, Skrowaczewski lobbied to have Orchestra Hall built, and he also introduced American audiences to the works of many Polish composers, including those of Penderecki, Szymanowski, and Lutosławski.

Between 1983 and 1992 he was principal conductor of the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester.

Between 1995 and 1997, Skrowaczewski served as artistic advisor to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. In 1988, he was composer-in-residence for the Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s summer season at Saratoga. He has guest-conducted that orchestra, and many others, all over the world. In 2007, he became principal conductor of the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra in Tokyo, and also made several recordings with the NHK Symphony Orchestra.

His complete set of recordings of the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, made with the Deutsche Radio Philharmonie Saarbrücken Kaiserslautern, has received much acclaim, as has his 2005/06 complete Beethoven symphony cycle with the orchestra. Another noted recording is his Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2 with the London Symphony Orchestra in collaboration with soloist Gina Bachauer.

Skrowaczewski&#x27;s &quot;Passacaglia Immaginaria&quot;, completed in 1995, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1997. Commissioned by the Minnesota Orchestral Association to honor the memory of Ken and Judy Dayton, it was premiered at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis in 1996.

His Chamber Concerto was commissioned by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in memory of Leopold Sipe, their first music director. Skrowaczewski received his second Pulitzer nomination in 1999 for his Concerto for Orchestra.

He received the Commander Order of the White Eagle, the highest order conferred by the Polish government, as well as the Gold Medal of the Mahler-Bruckner Society, the 1973 Ditson Conductor&#x27;s Award, and the Kennedy Center Friedheim Award&#x27;s third prize in 1978 for his &quot;Ricercari Notturni&quot; for saxophone and orchestra.

He was the father of Paul Sebastien, founder of electronica groups Psykosonik and Basic Pleasure Model, and of Nicholas Skrowaczewski. He lived in Wayzata, Minnesota, and died in St. Louis Park on February 21, 2017.

Frederick Harris, Jr., director of the MIT Wind Ensemble, wrote Skrowaczewski&#x27;s official biography.

<doc id="384583" wikidata="Q2443852" url="?curid=384583" title="Pen cancel">
<text>In philately, a pen cancel – symbol – is a cancellation of a postage or revenue stamp by the use of a pen, marker or crayon.

== Usage ==
In the early days of stamps, cancellation with a pen was common. Today stamps are almost always cancelled with an inked handstamp or a machine cancel as this is quicker to apply. Pen cancels are still sometimes seen today when a postal official needs to cancel stamps missed by the automatic cancelling machine.

There are no fixed terms for the different types of pen cancels, but a cancel in the form of two crossed lines has been referred to as an &quot;X cancel&quot;. Pen cancels may also take the form of notations by the canceller, the city in which the item was posted or the initials of the local postmaster.

A pen cancel may indicate fiscal (revenue) use; however, in the early days of stamps a pen cancel was sometimes used because no handstamp was available, for instance in Nicaragua where pen cancels were used for seven years after their first stamps appeared in 1862.

== Values ==
A used postage stamp with a pen cancel is usually worth much less than a stamp cancelled using a handstamp or machine. In particular, the additional information from the handstamp is lost and the pen cancel may indicate fiscal (revenue) rather than postal use. Pen cancelling is, however, a common method of cancelling stamps used fiscally. Stamps marked valid for both &quot;postage and revenue&quot; use are usually worth less when fiscally used.

== Tampering ==
Some people have attempted to remove pen cancels from used stamps in order to make them appear as more valuable mint stamps.

<text>The Armed Forces Bowl, formerly the Fort Worth Bowl from 2003 to 2005, is an annual postseason college football bowl game. First played in 2003, the game is normally held at the 45,000-seat Amon G. Carter Stadium on the campus of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. The 2010 and 2011 editions were instead played at Gerald J. Ford Stadium in University Park, Texas, when Amon G. Carter Stadium underwent a reconstruction project. Since 2014, the game has been sponsored by Lockheed Martin and is officially known as the &quot;Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl&quot;. Previous sponsors include Bell Helicopter (2006–2013) and PlainsCapital Bank (2003–2004).

The contest is one of 14 bowls produced by ESPN Events (previously ESPN Regional Television) and has been televised annually on ESPN since its inception. Armed Forces Insurance is the official Insurance Partner of the Armed Forces Bowl and has sponsored the Great American Patriot Award, presented at halftime at the bowl, since 2006.

==History==
The bowl was first played in December 2003, featuring two ranked teams, No. 18 Boise State and No. 19 TCU. It was the only edition to include a ranked team (per the AP Poll) until No. 22 Army played in December 2018.

In 2010 and 2011 when Amon G. Carter Stadium underwent a reconstruction project, the bowl was moved to Gerald J. Ford Stadium in nearby University Park, Texas.

Through the December 2018 playing, one of the three FBS-playing service academies (Army, Navy, and Air Force) has appeared in the game ten times. Contractual tie-ins with the American Athletic Conference (home of Navy), the Mountain West Conference (home of Air Force) and the independent Army assures that one of those schools could appear in the game every year, if bowl-eligible and not already committed to another bowl.

The 2018 game, between Army and Houston, was the first sellout in the bowl&#x27;s 16-year history.

===Sponsorship===
The bowl game was inaugurated in 2003 as the PlainsCapital Fort Worth Bowl, reflecting the sponsorship of PlainsCapital Bank. The bank&#x27;s sponsorship ended after the 2004 edition, and the 2005 game was staged without corporate sponsorship.

In 2006, Fort Worth based Bell Helicopter Textron took over sponsorship, and thus the game became officially known as the Bell Helicopter Armed Forces Bowl. The Bell sponsorship ended after the 2013 edition. During this time, the 2010 and 2011 Armed Forces Bowl were held at Gerald J. Ford Stadium on the campus of Southern Methodist University in the Dallas enclave of University Park, while Amon G. Carter Stadium was undergoing a major renovation. The game returned to Amon Carter Stadium in Fort Worth in 2012, after construction on that stadium was completed.

Alltel was to assume the title sponsorship and naming rights to the game beginning in 2014, which would have been titled the Alltel Wireless Bowl to promote its mobile division, but the deal fell through. Instead, Lockheed Martin became the game&#x27;s sponsor. The company has a major presence in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex: the company&#x27;s Lockheed Martin Aeronautics division is based in Fort Worth while its Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control division is based in nearby Grand Prairie. In December 2018, Lockheed Martin extended its sponsorship though 2025.

==Conference tie-ins==
The bowl&#x27;s partnership with the Big 12 Conference ended with the 2005 season. From 2006 to 2009, the Mountain West Conference was signed to provide a team to face either a team from the Pac-10 or Conference USA (C-USA), depending on the year; Pac-10 teams would play in odd number years while C-USA teams would play in even numbered years). As such, the 2006 and 2008 games featured C-USA teams Tulsa and Houston, respectively, whereas California represented the Pac-10 in 2007. The Pac-10 was unable to send a representative to the game in 2009, so C-USA sent Houston to the game for a second consecutive year. In 2010, since the Mountain West did not have enough eligible teams and Army was bowl eligible, Army played SMU in the bowl.

Following the 2013 football season, the Armed Forces Bowl signed multi-year agreements with the American Athletic Conference (The American), Big Ten Conference, Big 12 Conference, Mountain West Conference, Army and Navy to set bowl match-ups for the next six seasons (Navy later joined The American, and Army committed to do so beginning with the 2024 football season).

In December 2020, it was announced that the 2020 game would be played between teams from the Pac-12 and SEC, following cancellation of the ESPN Events-owned Las Vegas Bowl (which would have been featuring those tie-ins for the first time) due to complications relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to a lack of available teams from the Pac-12, Tulsa of the American Athletic Conference was ultimately selected to face Mississippi State of the SEC.

<text>Donald Ross Cherry (January 11, 1924 – April 4, 2018) was an American traditional pop and big band singer and golfer. In music, he is best known for his 1955 hit &quot;Band of Gold&quot;.

==Biography==
Cherry was born in Wichita Falls, Texas. He started in his early 20s as a big band singer in the orchestras of Jan Garber and Victor Young. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army Air Forces. In 1951, he recorded his first solo hits, &quot;Thinking of You&quot; and &quot;Belle, Belle, My Liberty Belle&quot;. In 1955, came his biggest hit, &quot;Band of Gold&quot;, which reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The track peaked at No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart. He had three more hits in 1956: &quot;Wild Cherry&quot;, &quot;Ghost Town&quot;, and &quot;Namely You&quot;, all backed by orchestra leader Ray Conniff. He was also the voice of the Mr. Clean commercials during the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1962, he also recorded the original version of &quot;Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye&quot;, which became a hit much later for The Casinos and others.

Throughout his singing career, Cherry was also a top-ranked amateur golfer, and was in contention to win the 1960 U.S. Open before eventually finishing tied for ninth along with Ben Hogan, four strokes behind winner Arnold Palmer. Cherry played on three Walker Cup teams (1953, 1955, and 1961), in the Americas Cup twice (1954 and 1960) and in nine Masters Tournaments, making the cut seven times with a best finish of T-25 in 1959. He captured the Canadian Amateur Championship in 1953 and the prestigious Sunnehanna Amateur title in 1954. In 1962, Cherry decided to turn professional and &quot;Pro&quot; became his nickname among fellow entertainers. His volcanic temper on the golf course (which, according to Cherry, &quot;...made Tommy Bolt look like a choir boy!&quot;) was in startling contrast to his velvety-smooth singing voice and pleasant stage persona. 

Cherry published his biography, &quot;Cherry&#x27;s Jubilee&quot;, with co-writer Neil Daniels. He was a good friend of Willie Nelson, and had collaborated on three albums with him, &quot;Augusta&quot; (1995), &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; (2002), and &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot; (2007).
Cherry was married four times, once to 1956 Miss America Sharon Ritchie, before wedding Francine Bond Smith, in 1993. They lived in Las Vegas, Nevada. His son, Stephen, was a casualty of the 9/11 attacks when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower. Stephen left behind four sons.

He was also married to Miss Nevada, Joy Garner and singer, Dean Martin was the best man at their wedding. Miss Garner was also a Copa showgirl at the Sands Hotel.

Cherry died at a hospice on April 4, 2018, at the age of 94. He is survived by his wife, Francine.

==Singles==

<text>The Mil Mi-24 (; NATO reporting name: Hind) is a large helicopter gunship, attack helicopter and low-capacity troop transport with room for eight passengers. It is produced by Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant and was introduced by the Soviet Air Force in 1972. The helicopter is currently in use by 58 countries.

In NATO circles, the export versions, Mi-25 and Mi-35, are denoted with a letter suffix as &quot;Hind D&quot; and &quot;Hind E&quot;. Soviet pilots called the Mi-24 the &quot;flying tank&quot; (), a term used historically with the famous World War II Soviet Il-2 &quot;Shturmovik&quot; armored ground attack aircraft. Other common unofficial nicknames were &quot;Galina&quot; (or &quot;Galya&quot;), &quot;Crocodile&quot; (), due to the helicopter&#x27;s camouflage scheme, and &quot;Drinking Glass&quot; (), because of the flat glass plates that surround earlier Mi-24 variants&#x27; cockpits.

==Development==
During the early 1960s, it became apparent to Soviet designer Mikhail Mil that the trend towards ever-increasing battlefield mobility would result in the creation of flying infantry fighting vehicles, which could be used to perform both fire support and infantry transport missions. The first expression of this concept was a mock-up unveiled in 1966 in the experimental department of the Ministry of Aircraft&#x27;s factory number 329, where Mil was head designer. The mock-up designated V-24 was based on another project, the V-22 utility helicopter, which never flew. The V-24 had a central infantry compartment that could hold eight troops sitting back to back, and a set of small wings positioned to the top rear of the passenger cabin, capable of holding up to six missiles or rockets and a twin-barreled GSh-23L cannon fixed to the landing skid.
Mil proposed the design to the heads of the Soviet armed forces. While he had the support of a number of strategists, he was opposed by several more senior members of the armed forces, who believed that conventional weapons were a better use of resources. Despite the opposition, Mil managed to persuade the defence minister&#x27;s first deputy, Marshal Andrey A. Grechko, to convene an expert panel to look into the matter. While the panel&#x27;s opinions were mixed, supporters of the project eventually held sway and a request for design proposals for a battlefield support helicopter was issued. The development and use of gunships and attack helicopters by the US Army during the Vietnam War convinced the Soviets of the advantages of armed helicopter ground support, and fostered support for the development of the Mi-24.

Mil engineers prepared two basic designs: a 7-ton single-engine design and a 10.5-ton twin-engine design, both based on the 1,700 hp Izotov TV3-177A turboshaft. Later, three complete mock-ups were produced, along with five cockpit mock-ups to allow the pilot and weapon station operator positions to be fine-tuned.

The Kamov design bureau suggested an army version of their Ka-25 ASW helicopter as a low-cost option. This was considered but later dropped in favor of the new Mil twin-engine design. A number of changes were made at the insistence of the military, including the replacement of the 23 mm cannon with a rapid-fire heavy machine gun mounted in a chin turret, and the use of the 9K114 Shturm (AT-6 Spiral) anti-tank missile.

A directive was issued on 6 May 1968 to proceed with the development of the twin-engine design. Work proceeded under Mil until his death in 1970. Detailed design work began in August 1968 under the codename Yellow 24. A full-scale mock-up of the design was reviewed and approved in February 1969. Flight tests with a prototype began on 15 September 1969 with a tethered hover, and four days later the first free flight was conducted. A second prototype was built, followed by a test batch of ten helicopters.
Acceptance testing for the design began in June 1970, continuing for 18 months. Changes made in the design addressed structural strength, fatigue problems and vibration levels. Also, a 12-degree anhedral was introduced to the wings to address the aircraft&#x27;s tendency to Dutch roll at speeds in excess of 200 km/h (124 mph), and the Falanga missile pylons were moved from the fuselage to the wingtips. The tail rotor was moved from the right to the left side of the tail, and the rotation direction reversed. The tail rotor now rotated up on the side towards the front of the aircraft, into the downwash of the rotor, which increased its efficiency. A number of other design changes were made until the production version Mi-24A (&quot;izdeliye 245&quot;) entered production in 1970, obtaining its initial operating capability in 1971 and was officially accepted into the state arsenal in 1972.

In 1972, following completion of the Mi-24, development began on a unique attack helicopter with transport capability. The new design had a reduced transport capability (three troops instead of eight) and was called the Mi-28, and that of the Ka-50 attack helicopter, which is smaller and more maneuverable and does not have the large cabin for carrying troops. In October 2007, the Russian Air Force announced it would replace its Mi-24 fleet with Mi-28Ns and Ka-52s by 2015. However, after the successful operation of the type in Syria it was decided to keep it in service and upgrade it with new electronics, sights, arms and night vision goggles.

==Design==
===Overview===
The core of the aircraft was derived from the Mil Mi-8 (NATO reporting name &quot;Hip&quot;) with two top-mounted turboshaft engines driving a mid-mounted five-blade main rotor and a three-blade tail rotor. The engine configuration gave the aircraft its distinctive double air intake. Original versions have an angular greenhouse-style cockpit; Model D and later have a characteristic tandem cockpit with a &quot;double bubble&quot; canopy. Other airframe components came from the Mi-14 &quot;Haze&quot;. Two mid-mounted stub wings provide weapon hardpoints, each offering three stations, in addition to providing lift. The loadout mix is mission dependent; Mi-24s can be tasked with close air support, anti-tank operations, or aerial combat.

The Mi-24&#x27;s titanium rotor blades are resistant to 12.7 mm (.50 caliber) rounds. The cockpit is protected by ballistic-resistant windscreens and a titanium-armored tub. The cockpit and crew compartment are overpressurized to protect the crew in NBC conditions.

===Flight characteristics===

Considerable attention was given to making the Mi-24 fast. The airframe was streamlined, and fitted with retractable tricycle undercarriage landing gear to reduce drag. At high speed, the wings provide considerable lift (up to a quarter of total lift). The main rotor was tilted 2.5° to the right from the fuselage to compensate for translating tendency at a hover. The landing gear was also tilted to the left so that the rotor would still be level when the aircraft was on the ground, making the rest of the airframe tilt to the left. The tail was also asymmetrical to give a side force at speed, thus unloading the tail rotor.

A modified Mi-24B, named A-10, was used in several speed and time-to-climb world record attempts. The helicopter had been modified to reduce weight as much as possible—one measure was the removal of the stub wings. The previous official speed record was set on 13 August 1975 over a closed course of ; many of the female-specific records were set by the all-female crew of Galina Rastorguyeva and Lyudmila Polyanskaya. On 21 September 1978, the A-10 set the absolute speed record for helicopters with over a 15/25 km course. The record stood until 1986, when it was broken by the current official record holder, a modified British Westland Lynx.

===Comparison to Western helicopters===

As a combination of armoured gunship and troop transport, the Mi-24 has no direct NATO counterpart. While the UH-1 (&quot;Huey&quot;) helicopters were used by the US in the Vietnam War either to ferry troops, or as gunships, they were not able to do both at the same time. Converting a UH-1 into a gunship meant stripping the entire passenger area to accommodate extra fuel and ammunition, and removing its troop transport capability. The Mi-24 was designed to do both, and this was greatly exploited by airborne units of the Soviet Army during the 1980–89 Soviet–Afghan War. The closest Western equivalent was the American Sikorsky S-67 Blackhawk, which used many of the same design principles and was also built as a high-speed, high-agility attack helicopter with limited troop transport capability using many components from the existing Sikorsky S-61. The S-67, however, was never adopted for service. Other Western equivalents are the Romanian Army&#x27;s IAR 330, which is a licence-built armed version of the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma, and the MH-60 Direct Action Penetrator, a special purpose armed variant of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk.

==Operational history==
===Ogaden War (1977–1978)===
The first combat use of the Mi-24 was with the Ethiopian forces during the Ogaden War against Somalia. The helicopters formed part of a massive airlift of military equipment from the Soviet Union, after the Soviets switched sides towards the end of 1977. The helicopters were instrumental in the combined air and ground assault that allowed the Ethiopians to retake the Ogaden by the beginning of 1978.

===Chadian–Libyan conflict (1978–1987)===
The Libyan air force used Mi-24A and Mi-25 units during their numerous interventions in Chad&#x27;s civil war. The Mi-24s were first used in October 1980 in the battle of N&#x27;Djamena, where they helped the People&#x27;s Armed Forces seize the capital.

In March 1987, the Armed Forces of the North, which were backed by the US and France, captured a Libyan air force base at Ouadi-Doum in Northern Chad. Among the aircraft captured during this raid were three Mi-25s. These were supplied to France, which in turn sent one to the United Kingdom and one to the US.

===Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979–1989)===

The aircraft was operated extensively during the Soviet–Afghan War, mainly for bombing Mujahideen fighters. When the U.S. supplied heat-seeking Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, the Soviet Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters proved to be favorite targets of the rebels.

It is difficult to find the total number of Mi-24s used in Afghanistan. At the end of 1990, the whole Soviet Army had 1,420 Mi-24s. During the Afghan war, sources estimated the helicopter strength to be as much as 600 units, with up to 250 being Mi-24s, whereas a (formerly secret) 1987 Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report says that the number of Mi-24s in theatre increased from 85 in 1980 to 120 in 1985.

====First deployment and combat====
In April 1979, Mi-24s were supplied to the Afghan government to deal with Mujahideen guerrillas. The Afghan pilots were well-trained and made effective use of their machines, but the Mujahideen were not easy targets. The first Mi-24 to be lost in action was shot down by guerrillas on 18 July 1979.
Despite facing strong resistance from Afghan rebels, the Mi-24 proved to be very destructive. The rebels called the Mi-24 &quot;&quot;Shaitan-Arba&quot; (Satan&#x27;s Chariot)&quot;. In one case, an Mi-24 pilot who was out of ammunition managed to rescue a company of infantry by maneuvering aggressively towards Mujahideen guerrillas and scaring them off. The Mi-24 was popular with ground troops, since it could stay on the battlefield and provide fire as needed, while &quot;fast mover&quot; strike jets could only stay for a short time before heading back to base to refuel.

The Mi-24&#x27;s favoured munition was the S-8 rocket, the S-5 having proven too light to be effective. The gun pod was also popular. Extra rounds of rocket ammunition were often carried internally so that the crew could land and self-reload in the field. The Mi-24 could carry ten iron bombs for attacks on camps or strongpoints, while harder targets could be dealt with a load of four or two iron bombs. Some Mi-24 crews became experts at dropping bombs precisely on targets. Fuel-air explosive bombs were also used in a few instances, though crews initially underestimated the sheer blast force of such weapons and were caught by the shock waves. The 9K114 Shturm was used infrequently, largely due to a lack of targets early in the war that required the precision and range the missile offered and a need to keep to stocks of anti tank missiles in Europe. After the Mujahideen got access to more advanced anti aircraft weapons later in the war the Shturm was used more often by Mi-24 units.

Combat experience quickly demonstrated the disadvantages of having an Mi-24 carrying troops. Gunship crews found the soldiers a concern and a distraction while being shot at, and preferred to fly lightly loaded anyway, especially given their operations from high ground altitudes in Afghanistan. Mi-24 troop compartment armour was often removed to reduce weight. Troops would be carried in Mi-8 helicopters while the Mi-24s provided fire support.
It proved useful to carry a technician in the Mi-24&#x27;s crew compartment to handle a light machine gun in a window port. This gave the Mi-24 some ability to &quot;watch its back&quot; while leaving a target area. In some cases, a light machine gun was fitted on both sides to allow the technician to move from one side to the other without having to take the machine gun with him.

This weapon configuration still left the gunship blind to the direct rear, and Mil experimented with fitting a machine gun in the back of the fuselage, accessible to the gunner through a narrow crawl-way. The experiment was highly unsuccessful, as the space was cramped, full of engine exhaust fumes, and otherwise unbearable. During a demonstration, an overweight Soviet Air Force general got stuck in the crawl-way. Operational Mi-24s were retrofitted with rear-view mirrors to help the pilot spot threats and take evasive action.

Besides protecting helicopter troop assaults and supporting ground actions, the Mi-24 also protected convoys, using rockets with flechette warheads to drive off ambushes; performed strikes on predesignated targets; and engaged in &quot;hunter-killer&quot; sweeps. Hunter-killer Mi-24s operated at a minimum in pairs, but were more often in groups of four or eight, to provide mutual fire support. The Mujahideen learned to move mostly at night to avoid the gunships, and in response the Soviets trained their Mi-24 crews in night-fighting, dropping parachute flares to illuminate potential targets for attack. The Mujahideen quickly caught on and scattered as quickly as possible when Soviet target designation flares were lit nearby.

====Attrition in Afghanistan====
The war in Afghanistan brought with it losses by attrition. The environment itself, dusty and often hot, was rough on the machines; dusty conditions led to the development of the twin PZU (&#x27;PyleZashchitnoe Ustroystvo&#x27;) air intake filters. The rebels&#x27; primary air-defence weapons early in the war were heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft cannons, though anything smaller than a 23 millimetre shell generally did not do much damage to an Mi-24. The cockpit glass panels were resistant to 12.7 mm (.50 in calibre) rounds.

The rebels also quickly began to use Soviet-made and US shoulder-launched, man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS) missiles such as the Strela and Redeye which had either been captured from the Soviets or their Afghan allies or were supplied from Western sources. Many of them came from stocks that the Israelis had captured during wars with Soviet backed states in the Middle East. Owing to a combination of the limited capabilities of these early types of missiles, poor training and poor material condition of the missiles, they were not particularly effective. Instead, the RPG-7, originally developed as an antitank weapon, was the first effective countermeasure to the Hind. The RPG-7, not designed for air defence, had inherent shortcomings in this role. When fired at the angles needed to hit aerial targets, the back-blast could easily wound the shooter, and the inevitable cloud of smoke and dust made it easy for gunners to spot the shooter&#x27;s position.

From 1986, the CIA began supplying the Afghan rebels with newer Stinger shoulder-launched, heat-seeking SAMs. These were a marked improvement over earlier weapons. Unlike the Redeye and SA-7, which locked on to only infrared emissions, the Stinger could lock onto both infrared and ultraviolet emissions. This enabled the operator to engage an aircraft from all angles rather than just the tail and made it significantly more resistant to countermeasures like flares. In addition the Mil helicopters, particularly the Mi-24, suffered from a design flaw in the configuration of their engines that made them highly vulnerable to the Stinger. The Mi-24, along with the related Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters, had its engines placed in an inline configuration in an attempt to streamline the helicopter to increase speed and minimize the aircraft&#x27;s overall frontal profile to incoming fire in a head on attack. However this had the opposite effect of leaking all the exhaust gasses from the Mi-24&#x27;s engines directly out the side of the aircraft and away from the helicopter&#x27;s rotor wash, creating two massive sources of heat and ultraviolet radiation for the Stinger to lock onto. The inline placement of the engines was seen as so problematic in this regard that Mil designers abandoned the configuration on the planned successor to the Mi-24, the Mil Mi-28, in favour of an engine placement more akin to Western attack helicopters which vents the exhaust gasses into the helicopter&#x27;s main rotor wash to dissipate heat.

Initially, the attack doctrine of the Mi-24 was to approach its target from high altitude and dive downwards. After the introduction of the Stinger, doctrine changed to &quot;nap of the earth&quot; flying, where they approached very low to the ground and engaged more laterally, popping up to only about in order to aim rockets or cannons. Countermeasure flares and missile warning systems would be installed in all Soviet Mil Mi-2, Mi-8, and Mi-24 helicopters, giving pilots a chance to evade missiles fired at them. Heat dissipation devices were also fitted to exhausts to decrease the Mi-24&#x27;s heat signature. Tactical and doctrinal changes were introduced to make it harder for the enemy to deploy these weapons effectively. These reduced the Stinger threat, but did not eliminate it.

Mi-24s were also used to shield jet transports flying in and out of Kabul from Stingers. The gunships carried flares to blind the heat-seeking missiles. The crews called themselves &quot;Mandatory Matrosovs&quot;, after a Soviet hero of World War II who threw himself across a German machine gun to let his comrades break through.

According to Russian sources, 74 helicopters were lost, including 27 shot down by Stinger and two by Redeye. In many cases, the helicopters with their armour and durable construction could withstand significant damage and able to return to base.

====Mi-24 crews and end of Soviet involvement====
Mi-24 crews carried AK-74 assault rifles and other hand-held weapons to give them a better chance of survival if forced down. Early in the war, Marat Tischenko, head of the Mil design bureau visited Afghanistan to see what the troops thought of his helicopters, and gunship crews put on several displays for him. They even demonstrated manoeuvres, such as barrel rolls, which design engineers considered impossible. An astounded Tischenko commented, &quot;I thought I knew what my helicopters could do, now I&#x27;m not so sure!&quot;

The last Soviet Mi-24 shot down was during the night of 2 February 1989, with both crewmen killed. It was also the last Soviet helicopter lost during nearly 10 years of warfare.

====Mi-24s in Afghanistan after Soviet withdrawal====

Mi-24s passed on to Soviet-backed Afghan forces during the war remained in dwindling service in the grinding civil war that continued after the Soviet withdrawal.

Afghan Air Force Mi-24s in the hands of the ascendant Taliban gradually became inoperable, but a few flown by the Northern Alliance, which had Russian assistance and access to spares, remained operational up to the US invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001. In 2008, the Afghan Air Force took delivery of six refurbished Mi-35 helicopters, purchased from the Czech Republic. The Afghan pilots were trained by India and began live firing exercises in May 2009 in order to escort Mi-17 transport helicopters on operations in restive parts of the country.

===Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988)===
The Mi-25 saw considerable use by the Iraqi Army during the long war against Iran. Its heavy armament caused severe losses to Iranian ground forces during the war. However, the Mi-25 lacked an effective anti-tank capability, as it was only armed with obsolete 9M17 Skorpion missiles. This led the Iraqis to develop new gunship tactics, with help from East German advisors. The Mi-25s would form &quot;hunter-killer&quot; teams with French-built Aérospatiale Gazelles, with the Mi-25s leading the attack and using their massive firepower to suppress Iranian air defences, and the Gazelles using their HOT missiles to engage armoured fighting vehicles. These tactics proved effective in halting Iranian offensives, such as Operation Ramadan in July 1982.
This war also saw the only confirmed air-to-air helicopter battles in history with the Iraqi Mi-25s flying against Iranian AH-1J SeaCobras (supplied by the United States before the Iranian Revolution) on several separate occasions. In November 1980, not long after Iraq&#x27;s initial invasion of Iran, two Iranian SeaCobras engaged two Mi-25s with TOW wire-guided antitank missiles. One Mi-25 went down immediately, the other was badly damaged and crashed before reaching base. The Iranians repeated this accomplishment on 24 April 1981, destroying two Mi-25s without incurring losses to themselves. One Mi-25 was also downed by an IRIAF F-14A.

The Iraqis hit back, claiming the destruction of a SeaCobra on 14 September 1983 (with YaKB machine gun), then three SeaCobras on 5 February 1984 and three more on 25 February 1984 (two with Falanga missiles, one with S-5 rockets). A 1982 news article published on the Iraqi Observer claimed an Iraqi Mi-24D shot down an Iranian F-4 Phantom II using its armaments, either antitank missiles, guns or S-5 unguided rockets.

After a lull in helicopter losses, each side lost a gunship on 13 February 1986. Later, a Mi-25 claimed a SeaCobra shot down with YaKB gun on 16 February, and a SeaCobra claimed a Mi-25 shot down with rockets on 18 February. The last engagement between the two types was on 22 May 1986, when Mi-25s shot down a SeaCobra. The final claim tally was 10 SeaCobras and 6 Mi-25s destroyed. The relatively small numbers and the inevitable disputes over actual kill numbers makes it unclear if one gunship had a real technical superiority over the other. Iraqi Mi-25s also claimed 43 kills against other Iranian helicopters, such as Agusta-Bell UH-1 Hueys.

In general, the Iraqi pilots liked the Mi-25, in particular for its high speed, long range, high versatility and large weapon load, but disliked the relatively ineffectual anti-tank guided weapons and lack of agility.

===Nicaraguan civil war (1980–1988)===
Mi-25s were also used by the Nicaraguan Army during the civil war of the 1980s. Nicaragua received 12 Mi-25s (some sources claim 18) in the mid-1980s to deal with &quot;Contra&quot; insurgents. The Mi-25s performed ground attacks on the Contras and were also fast enough to intercept light aircraft being used by the insurgents. The U.S. Reagan Administration regarded introduction of the Mi-25s as a major escalation of tensions in Central America.

Two Mi-25s were shot down by Stingers fired by the Contras. A third Mi-25 was damaged while pursuing Contras near the Honduran border, when it was intercepted by Honduran F-86 Sabres and A-37 Dragonflies. A fourth was flown to Honduras by a defecting Sandinista pilot in December 1988.

===Sri Lankan Civil War (1987–2009)===
The Indian Peace Keeping Force (1987–90) in Sri Lanka used Mi-24s when an Indian Air Force detachment was deployed there in support of the Indian and Sri Lankan armed forces in their fight against various Tamil militant groups such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). It is believed that Indian losses were considerably reduced by the heavy fire support from their Mi-24s. The Indians lost no Mi-24s in the operation, as the Tigers had no weapons capable of downing the gunship at the time.

Since 14 November 1995, the Mi-24 has been used by the Sri Lanka Air Force in the war against the LTTE liberation group and has proved highly effective at providing close air support for ground forces. The Sri Lanka Air Force operates a mix of Mi-24/-35P and Mi-24V/-35 versions attached to its No. 9 Attack Helicopter Squadron. They have recently been upgraded with modern Israeli FLIR and electronic warfare systems. Five were upgraded to intercept aircraft by adding radar, fully functional helmet mounted target tracking systems, and AAMs. More than five Mi-24s have been lost to LTTE MANPADS, and another two lost in attacks on air bases, with one heavily damaged but later returned to service.

===Peruvian operations (1989–present)===
The Peruvian Air Force received 12 Mi-25Ds and 2 Mi-25DU from the Soviets in 1983, 1984, and 1985 after ordering them in the aftermath of 1981 Paquisha conflict with Ecuador. Seven more second hand units (4 Mi-24D and 3 Mi-25D) were obtained from Nicaragua in 1992. These have been permanently based at the Vitor airbase near La Joya ever since, operated by the 2nd Air Group of the 211th Air Squadron. Their first deployment occurred in June 1989 during the war against Communist guerrillas in the Peruvian highlands, mainly against Shining Path. Despite the conflict continuing, it has decreased in scale and is now limited to the jungle areas of Valley of Rivers Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro (VRAEM).

Peru also employed Mi-25s against Ecuadorian forces during the short Cenepa conflict in early 1995. The only loss occurred on 7 February, when a FAP Mi-25 was downed after being hit in quick succession by at least two, probably three, 9K38 Igla shoulder-fired missiles during a low-altitude mission over the Cenepa valley. The three crewmen were killed.

By 2011 two Mi-35P were purchased from Russia to reinforce the 211th Air Squadron.

===Persian Gulf War (1991)===
The Mi-24 was also heavily employed by the Iraqi Army during their invasion of Kuwait, although most were withdrawn by Saddam Hussein when it became apparent that they would be needed to help retain his grip on power in the aftermath of the war. In the ensuing 1991 uprisings in Iraq, these helicopters were used against dissidents as well as fleeing civilian refugees.

===Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002)===
Three Mi-24Vs owned by Sierra Leone and flown by South African military contractors, including Neall Ellis, were used against RUF rebels. In 1995, they helped drive the RUF from the capital, Freetown. Neall Ellis also piloted a Mi-24 during the British-led Operation Barras against West Side Boys. Guinea also used its Mi-24s against the RUF on both sides of the border and was alleged to have provided air support to the LURD insurgency in northern Liberia in 2001–03.

===Croatian War of Independence (1990s)===
Twelve Mi-24s were delivered to Croatia in 1993, and were used effectively in 1995 by the Croatian Army in Operation Storm against the Army of Krajina. The Mi-24 was used to strike deep into enemy territory and disrupt Krajina army communications. One Croatian Mi-24 crashed near the city of Drvar, Bosnia and Herzegovina due to strong winds. Both the pilot and the operator survived. The Mi-24s used by Croatia were obtained from Ukraine. One Mi-24 was modified to carry Mark 46 torpedoes. The helicopters were withdrawn from service in 2004.

===First and Second Wars in Chechnya (1990s–2000s)===
During the First and Second Chechen Wars, beginning in 1994 and 1999 respectively, Mi-24s were employed by the Russian armed forces.

In the first year of the Second Chechen War, 11 Mi-24s were lost by Russian forces, about half of which were lost as a result of enemy action.

===Sudanese Civil War (1995–2005)===
In 1995, the Sudanese Air Force acquired six Mi-24s for use in Southern Sudan and the Nuba mountains to engage the SPLA. At least two aircraft were lost in non-combat situations within the first year of operation. A further twelve were bought in 2001, and used extensively in the oil fields of Southern Sudan. Mi-24s were also deployed to Darfur in 2004–05.

===First and Second Congo Wars (1996–2003)===
Three Mi-24s were used by Mobutu&#x27;s army and were later acquired by the new Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These were supplied to Zaire in 1997 as part of a French-Serbian contract. At least one was flown by Serbian mercenaries. One hit a power line and crashed on 27 March 1997, killing the three crew and four passengers. Zimbabwean Mi-24s were also operated in coordination with the Congolese Army.

The United Nations peacekeeping mission employed Indian Air Force Mi-24/-35 helicopters to provide support during the Second Congo War. The IAF has been operating in the region since 2003.

=== Kosovo War (1998–1999) ===
Two second-hand Mi-24Vs procured from Ukraine earlier in the 1990s were used by the Yugoslav Special Operation Unit (JSO) against Kosovo Albanian rebels during the Kosovo War.

===Insurgency in Macedonia (2001)===
The Macedonian military acquired used Ukrainian Mi-24Vs, which were then used frequently against Albanian insurgents during the 2001 insurgency in Macedonia (now North Macedonia). The main areas of action were in Tetovo, Radusha and Aracinovo.

===Ivorian Civil War (2002–2004)===
During the Ivorian Civil War, five Mil Mi-24s piloted by mercenaries were used in support of government forces. They were later destroyed by the French Army in retaliation for an air attack on a French base that killed nine soldiers.

===War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)===
In 2008 and 2009, the Czech Republic donated six Mi-24s under the ANA Equipment Donation Programme. As a result, the Afghan National Army Air Corps (ANAAC) gained the ability to escort its own helicopters with heavily armed attack helicopters. ANAAC operates nine Mi-35s. Major Caleb Nimmo, a United States Air Force Pilot, was the first American to fly the Mi-35 Hind, or any Russian helicopter, in combat. On 13 September 2011, a Mi-35 of the Afghan Air Force was used to hold back an attack on ISAF and police buildings.

The Polish Helicopter Detachment contributed Mi-24s to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The Polish pilots trained in Germany before deploying to Afghanistan and train with U.S. service personnel. On 26 January 2011, one Mi-24 caught on fire during take-off from its base in Ghazni. One American and four Polish soldiers evacuated unharmed.

India has also donated Mi-35s to Afghanistan. Four helicopters were to be supplied, with three already transferred in January 2016. The three Mi-35s made a big difference in the offensive against militants, according to General John Campbell, commander of US forces in Afghanistan.

===Iraq War (2003–2011)===
The Polish contingent in Iraq used six Mi-24Ds after December 2004. One of them crashed on 18 July 2006 in an air base in Al Diwaniyah. Polish Mi-24Ds used in Iraq were not returned to Poland due to their age, condition, low combat value of the Mi-24D variant, and high shipping costs; depending on their condition, they were transferred to the new Iraqi Army or scrapped.

===War in Somalia (2006–2009)===
The Ethiopian Air Force operated about three Mil Mi-35 and ten Mil Mi-24D helicopter gunships in the Somali theatre. One was shot down near Mogadishu International Airport on 30 March 2007 by Somali insurgents.

===2008 Russo-Georgian War===
Mil Mi-24s were used by both sides during the fighting in South Ossetia. During the war Georgian Air Force Mi-24s attacked their first targets on an early morning hour of 8 August, targeting the Ossetian presidential palace. The second target was a cement factory near Tskhinvali, where major enemy forces and ammunition were located. The last combat mission of the GAF Mi-24s was on 11 August, when a large Russian convoy, consisting of light trucks and BMP IFVs which were heading to the Georgian village of Avnevi was targeted by Mi-24s, completely destroying the convoy. The Georgian Air Force lost 2 Mi-24s on Senaki air base. They were destroyed by Russian troops on the ground. Both helicopters were in-operational. The Russian army heavily used Mi-24s in the conflict. Russian upgraded Mi-24PNs were credited for destroying 2 Georgian T-72SIM1 tanks, using guided missiles at night time, though some sources attribute those kills to Mil Mi-28. The Russian army did not lose any Mi-24s throughout the conflict, mainly because those helicopters were deployed to areas where Georgian air defence was not active, though some were damaged by small arms fire and at least one Mi-24 was lost due to technical reasons.

===War in Chad (2008)===
On returning to Abeche, one of the Chadian Mi-35s made a forced landing at the airport. It was claimed that it was shot down by rebels.

===Libyan civil war (2011)===

The Libyan Air Force Mi-24s were used by both sides to attack enemy positions during the 2011 Libyan civil war. A number were captured by the rebels, who formed the Free Libyan Air Force together with other captured air assets. During the battle for Benina airport, one Mi-35 (serial number 853), was destroyed on the ground on 23 February 2011. In the same action, serial number 854 was captured by the rebels together with an Mi-14 (serial number 1406). Two Mi-35s operating for the pro-Gaddafi Libyan Air Force were destroyed on the ground on 26 March 2011 by French aircraft enforcing the no-fly zone. One Free Libyan Air Force Mi-25D (serial number 854, captured at the beginning of the revolt) violated the no-fly-zone on 9 April 2011 to strike loyalist positions in Ajdabiya. It was shot down by Libyan ground forces during the action. The pilot, Captain Hussein Al-Warfali, died in the crash. The rebels claimed that a number of other Mi-25s were shot down.

===2010–2011 Ivorian crisis===
Ukrainian army Mi-24P helicopters as part of the United Nations peacekeeping force fired four missiles at a pro-Gbagbo military camp in Ivory Coast&#x27;s main city of Abidjan.

===Syrian Civil War (2011–present)===

The Syrian Air Force has used Mi-24s during the ongoing Syrian Civil War, including in many of the country&#x27;s major cities. Controversy has surrounded an alleged delivery of Mi-25s to the Syrian military, due to Turkey and other NATO members disallowing such arms shipments through their territory.

On 3 November 2016, a Russian Mi-35 made an emergency landing near Syria&#x27;s Palmyra city, and was hit and destroyed, most likely by an unguided recoilless weapon after it touched down. The crew returned safely to the Khmeimim air base.

===Second Kachin conflict (2011–present)===
The Myanmar Air Force used the Mi-24 in the Kachin conflict against the Kachin Independence Army. Two Mi-35 helicopters were shot down by the Kachin Independence Army during the heavy fighting in the mountains of northern Burma in 2012 and early 2013.

On 3 May 2021, in the morning, a Myanmar Air Force Mi-35 was shot down by the Kachin Independence Army, hit by a MANPADS during air raids involving attack helicopters and fighter jets. A video emerged showing the helicopter being hit while flying over a village.

===Post-U.S. Iraqi insurgency===
Iraq ordered a total of 34 Mi-35Ms in 2013, as part of an arms deal with Russia that also included Mi-28 attack helicopters. The delivery of the first four was announced by then-Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in November 2013.

Their first deployment began in late December against camps of the al-Qaeda linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and several Islamist militants in the al-Anbar province that had taken control of several areas of Fallujah and Ramadi. FLIR footage of the strikes has been released by the military.

On 3 October 2014, ISIL militants reportedly used a FN-6 shoulder-launched missile in Baiji to shoot down an Iraqi Army Mi-35M attack helicopter. Video footage released by ISIL militants shows at least another two Iraqi Mi-35s brought down by light anti-aircraft artillery.

=== Balochistan Insurgency (2012–present) ===
In 2018, Pakistan received 4 Mi-35M Hind-E Gunships from Russia under the $153 million deal. They are now stationed at the Army Aviation Corps base at Quetta Cantonment. The gunships have since been used in several counter insurgency operations against various militant groups in the Balochistan province of Pakistan.
In early 2022, a base in Nushki and a check-post in Panjgur belonging to the Frontier Corps Balochistan Paramilitary were attacked by BLA terrorists. The attack in Nushki was swiftly repulsed but the situation in Panjgaur was not good to which Mi-35 Hind and AH-1F Cobra gunships were called in for support. It provided much needed ground support and reconnaissance in the counter offensive which led to success.

===Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)===
During the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, Russia deployed 13 Mi-24s to support their infantry as they advanced through the region. However these aircraft saw no combat during their deployment.

===War in Donbas (2014-2022)===

During the Siege of Sloviansk, on 2 May 2014, two Ukrainian Mi-24s were shot down by pro-Russian insurgents. The Ukrainian armed forces claim that they were downed by MANPADS while on patrol close to Sloviansk. The Ukrainian government confirmed that both aircraft were shot down, along with an Mi-8 damaged by small arms fire. Initial reports mentioned two dead and others wounded; later, five crew members were confirmed dead and one taken prisoner until being released on 5 May.

On 5 May 2014, another Ukrainian Mi-24 was forced to make an emergency landing after being hit by machine gun fire while on patrol close to Sloviansk. The Ukrainian forces recovered the two pilots and destroyed the helicopter with a rocket strike by an Su-25 aircraft to prevent its capture by pro-Russian insurgents.

Ukrainian Su-25s, with MiG-29 fighters providing top cover, supported Mi-24s during the battle for Donetsk Airport.

On 13 October 2018, a Ukrainian Mi-24 shot down an Orlan-10 UAV using cannon fire near Lysychansk.

===Chadian offensive against Boko Haram (2015)===
Chadian Mi-24s were used during the 2015 West African offensive against Boko Haram.

===Azerbaijan-Karabakh (2014–2016, 2020)===
On 12 November 2014, Azerbaijani forces shot down an Armenian forces Mi-24 from a formation of two which were flying along the disputed border, close to the frontline between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops in the disputed Karabakh territory. The helicopter was hit by an Igla-S shoulder-launched missile fired by Azerbaijani soldiers while flying at low altitude and crashed, killing all three on board.

On 2 April 2016, during a clash between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces, an Azerbaijani Mi-24 helicopter was shot down by &quot;Nagorno-Karabakh&quot; forces. The downing was confirmed by the Azerbaijani defence ministry.

On 9 November 2020, during the Nagorno-Karabakh war a Russian Mi-24 was shot down by Azerbaijani forces with a MANPADS. The Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry stated that the downing was an accident. Two crew members were killed and one sustained moderate injuries. The Russian defence ministry confirmed the downing in a press release the same day.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022–present)===
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, both Ukraine and Russia have used Mi-24 helicopters. On 1 March 2022, Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian Mi-35M helicopter with MANPADS, in the Kyiv Reservoir (see also Battle of Kyiv). On 5 May 2022, the helicopter was retrieved by Ukrainian engineers in Vyshgorod. Two Russian Mi-35 were shot down by a MANPADS on 5 March 2022. On 6 March, one Mi-24P with registration number &quot;RF-94966&quot; was shot down by Ukrainian MANPADS in Kyiv Oblast. On 8 March 2022 one Ukrainian Mil Mi-24 from the was lost over Brovary, Kyiv. Pilots Col. Oleksandr Maryniak and Cptn. Ivan Bezzub were killed. On 17 March a Russian Mi-35M was reported destroyed by Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, unknown location. On 1 April 2022, two Ukrainian Mi-24s reportedly entered Russia and attacked an oil storage facility in Belgorod.

In May 2022, the Czech Republic donated Mi-24 helicopters to Ukraine. In July 2023, it was reported that Poland secretly donated at least a dozen Mi-24s to Ukraine.

As of 29 August 2024, visually confirmed losses compiled by Oryx blog are listed as following: 4 Mi-24P, 4 Mi-24V/P/35M, 10 Mi-35M for the Russian side, and 2 Mi-24P and 5 Mi-24 of unknown variant for the Ukrainian side.

<doc id="384599" wikidata="Q4868247" url="?curid=384599" title="Foot in Mouth Award">
<text>The Foot in Mouth Award is presented each year by the Plain English Campaign for &quot;a baffling comment by a public figure&quot;. The award was first made in 1993, when it was given to Ted Dexter, the chairman of selectors for the England cricket team. It was awarded again the following year, and, after a two-year break, annually from 1997 to 2022.

The Plain English Campaign was set up in 1979 when the founder, Chrissie Maher, shredded hundreds of jargon-filled forms and documents in Parliament Square, London. The group gave their first awards the next year, rewarding organisations that used &quot;plain English&quot; and highlighting those that did not. Although the Foot in Mouth award was first presented in 1993, the group&#x27;s 1991 awards gave acknowledgement to a confusing comment by Dan Quayle, then Vice President of the United States.

The award has been presented 29 times, with only Boris Johnson and Rhodri Morgan receiving it more than once. Johnson won in 2004, 2016, and 2019, while Morgan won in 1998 and 2005. Johnson made a light-hearted response to his second win, claiming that the first award had &quot;made [his] name.&quot; Politicians have been recipients of the award more times than any profession, collecting it on sixteen occasions; athletes, sports managers and sports commentators have won five times. George W. Bush received a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; in 2008 for &quot;services to gobbledygook&quot; throughout his presidency.

The phrase &quot;foot in mouth&quot; is of a family of idioms having to do with eating and being proven incorrect, such as to &quot;eat crow&quot;, &quot;eat dirt&quot;, to &quot;eat your hat&quot; (or shoe); all probably originating from &quot;to eat one&#x27;s words&quot;, which first appears in print in 1571 in one of John Calvin&#x27;s tracts, on Psalm 62: &quot;God eateth not his words when he hath once spoken&quot;.

<doc id="384601" wikidata="Q826185" url="?curid=384601" title="Busted (band)">
<text>Busted are an English pop-punk band from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, consisting of James Bourne, Matt Willis and Charlie Simpson. Formed in 2000, the band has had four UK number-one singles, won two Brit Awards, released four studio albums and sold over 5 million records worldwide. The band released the albums &quot;Busted&quot; in 2002 and &quot;A Present for Everyone&quot; in 2003 before disbanding in January 2005. 

Following the split, all three members pursued separate musical careers: Simpson as the frontman for the post-hardcore band Fightstar, Bourne as the lead singer of pop-punk band Son of Dork and Willis as a solo artist. The band reunited in 2015, embarking on the Pigs Can Fly arena tour in May 2016 and releasing their third studio album, &quot;Night Driver&quot;, on 25 November 2016. On 26 October 2018, Busted announced their fourth album, &quot;Half Way There&quot;, released on 1 February 2019, as well as a UK arena tour. At the end of 2019, the band embarked on a hiatus to pursue solo projects. In 2023, Busted announced their return for their 20th anniversary, consisting of a greatest hits album, &quot;Greatest Hits 2.0&quot;, and arena tour.

According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Busted has been certified for sales of 2.4 million albums and 2.8 million singles in the UK.

==History==
===2000–2002: Formation, &quot;Busted&quot; and rise to fame===
James Bourne and Matt Willis originally auditioned for other bands which neither of them made it into. They remained friends for a number of years and wrote material together, which Willis claimed was inspired by BBMak, Blink-182 and the &quot;American Pie 2&quot; soundtrack. Initially known as The Termites, Busted were formed in 2000 after open auditions were held by Prestige Artist Management to form a new band. The line-up consisted of Bourne, Willis, Ki Fitzgerald and Owen Doyle, although this version of the band broke up in October 2001.

Looking to find a new band member, Willis and Bourne placed an ad in &quot;NME&quot; magazine, titled &quot;Guitarist and singer wanted for pop band…&quot;. Auditions were held at Pineapple Studios in Covent Garden in October 2001. Charlie Simpson and Tom Fletcher were both offered a place to complete the line-up, but Busted&#x27;s manager told Fletcher via a phone call a few days later that the band was to go ahead as a trio, comprising Bourne, Willis and Simpson.

The band was launched in August 2002, making their first appearance on the cover of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; with the headline: &quot;Meet Busted: They&#x27;re Going to Be Bigger than Rik Waller!&quot;, making it a first for any pop band to appear on the magazine&#x27;s cover before releasing a single. Their debut single, &quot;What I Go to School For&quot;, inspired by a teacher that Willis had a crush on at school, was finally released in September 2002. It reached number three on the UK Singles Chart and was later performed in a girls school after the students won a BRMB competition. Their debut album, &quot;Busted&quot;, was then released, initially charting only around the UK Top 30 and receiving mixed reviews from critics however, it went on to peak at number 2. The follow-up &quot;Year 3000&quot;, which was written about Bourne&#x27;s obsession with the film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, then followed in January 2003, reaching number two in the UK chart. In April, their third single, &quot;You Said No&quot; became their first number one. &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; certified them as the first act ever to have their debut three singles enter the top three in an ascending order.

Recording began for their second album while the debut album was re-released with new tracks and an enhanced CD section. It would go on to sell 1.2 million copies by the end of the year. The debut album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Sleeping with the Light On&quot;, reached number 3 in August 2003, beaten to number one by Blu Cantrell&#x27;s &quot;Breathe&quot;.

===2003–2005: &quot;A Present for Everyone&quot; and split===
Busted started the summer of 2003 with a win for Favourite Newcomer at the National Music Awards, as well as Best Band at that year&#x27;s Disney Channel Kids&#x27; Awards. After this, the band launched the promotional trail for their new album, &quot;A Present for Everyone,&quot; and its lead single, &quot;Crashed the Wedding&quot;, which reached number one in the UK chart. Edgier than their previous album, Simpson said that it had some &quot;harder, Good Charlotte type vibes coming through on this album&quot;. This album would also go on to reach sales of over 1 million copies.

During 2003, Charlie met fellow songwriter-guitarist Alex Westaway and drummer Omar Abidi at a party. He was by this stage becoming increasingly frustrated by the music he was performing in Busted and stated he had &quot;all of this creativity pent up inside and I just needed to vent it somewhere, and I was writing a lot of songs but I couldn&#x27;t play them, because I didn&#x27;t have anyone to play them with&quot;. During the aforementioned party, an impromptu jam session took place. Simpson, Westaway, and Abidi played Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s song &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; on loop, and agreed to attend a gig a few days later. After the show, they went back to Simpson&#x27;s flat and began performing on guitars and a v-drum kit, which led to their first song being written, titled &quot;Too Much Punch&quot;. Westaway later invited bassist Dan Haigh to practice with the band and soon began booking regular rehearsal sessions together, under the name Fightstar.

2004 was to prove their final year together as a band. The band performed a successful arena tour to start the year before reaching number one and number two with &quot;Who&#x27;s David&quot; and &quot;Air Hostess&quot;, respectively. They picked up Best British Breakthrough Act and Best Pop Act at that year&#x27;s BRIT Awards.

The boys then headed over to the U.S. to release a self-titled album that was a mixture of their first and second albums. Their exploits were captured for the TV series &quot;America or Busted&quot;, about Busted&#x27;s attempts to achieve success in the United States, which ultimately failed. The show debuted on MTV UK in November of that year, over the course of the series, it saw Busted&#x27;s attempts to &#x27;break&#x27; America dwindle as interviews fell through and performances remained limited both in terms of audience size and press attention.

Whilst the band were out in America, they were then invited to record the theme tune to the brand new &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; film that was coming out that summer. Released as a double A-side with the album track, &quot;3AM&quot;, it gave them their fourth and final number one in August 2004, staying at the top for two weeks, the longest they had ever spent at the top. However, the release of the fifth single from their second album, &quot;She Wants to Be Me&quot;, failed to chart due to its lone formats being a download and a limited edition pocket sized CD, both of which breached chart regulations at the time. Their live album, &quot;A Ticket for Everyone&quot;, was released in November peaked at number eleven. The band embarked on another sell-out tour that November, and Busted gained a record of the band to play the most consecutive sellout dates at Wembley Arena, eleven nights. At the end of 2004, Busted were involved in the UK number-one Christmas single, Band Aid 20&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; with money raised helping to combat HIV and AIDS across Africa, famine relief in the Darfur region of Sudan and aid relief in many countries, such as Ethiopia.

Simpson&#x27;s time spent with Fightstar reportedly began to cause tensions within the band, amplified when Fightstar announced a 14-date UK tour. Simpson announced to Busted&#x27;s manager on 24 December 2004 over a phone call that he was leaving the band to focus on Fightstar full-time. On 13 January 2005, Busted&#x27;s record label announced that a press conference was to be held at the Soho Hotel in London the following day. The next day, the 14th, it was then announced that Busted were splitting up after Simpson&#x27;s departure weeks before.

In an interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in November 2009, Simpson said, &quot;It was a real fun thing to be doing, and I got on well with everyone I was doing it with, but on the other side, the music wasn&#x27;t really fulfilling me. I have good memories of the time because we were traveling the world and doing some amazing things, but then as far as self-fulfillment goes, it wasn&#x27;t really doing a lot for me, so I have these mixed views when I look back. But there&#x27;s no doubt that it was an amazing thing to do&quot;.

===2006–2012: Solo projects and bands===
Simpson began pursuing a solo career after playing in Fightstar, a post-hardcore band which differs greatly from the sound of Busted. They formed a year prior to Busted&#x27;s split. To-date they have released one EP and four albums: &quot;They Liked You Better When You Were Dead&quot;, &quot;Grand Unification&quot;, &quot;One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours&quot;, &quot;Be Human&quot; and &quot;Behind the Devil&#x27;s Back&quot;, all being released in both the UK and the US. They have also released an album of b-sides and rarities, &quot;Alternate Endings&quot;. Fightstar announced a hiatus at the beginning of 2010, stating that they were &quot;taking some time off&quot; to work on separate projects before regrouping to begin working a new record. After their 2014 reunion and 2015 album, Fightstar began to describe themselves as a &quot;passion project&quot; rather than a full-time band, as the members focus on other projects. Simpson released a solo acoustic album called &quot;Young Pilgrim&quot;, which peaked at number 6 in the UK Albums Chart in 2011, followed by the 2014 album &quot;Long Road Home&quot;.

Bourne went on to release music through pop punk band Son of Dork, and pursued a solo career under the name of Future Boy. Bourne has also written songs for many artists, including Melanie C, McFly, JC Chasez, Patrick Monahan, and the Jonas Brothers. From 2007 to 2008, he was one of the main songwriters for the ITV musical drama, Britannia High.

After a brief stint in rehab after the Busted split, Willis began a solo career, releasing singles in 2006 and 2007, &quot;Up All Night&quot;, &quot;Hey Kid&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Go to Waste&quot;, and &quot;Crash&quot; for the film Mr Bean&#x27;s Holiday, all except the latter of which were included on his album &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Go to Waste&quot;. Willis also appeared on, and was the winner of, the 2006 series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. After being dropped from his record label, Willis turned to presenting. He presented at the Brit Awards and ITV2&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! NOW!&quot; alongside his wife, Emma, the pair worked together on E!, presenting the BAFTAs. On Willis&#x27; Myspace, he has stated that he is currently writing with his new band, yet to be named.

===2013–2015: McBusted===

From 19 to 22 September 2013, Willis and Bourne made a surprise brief reunion as McBusted when they joined McFly as special guests during the band&#x27;s four 10th anniversary concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. They performed &quot;Year 3000&quot;, &quot;Air Hostess&quot; and McFly&#x27;s &quot;Shine a Light&quot; with McFly under the name &#x27;McBusted&#x27;. McFly and Busted confirmed a 2014 tour together. Simpson said through Twitter that although he would not be joining the new supergroup, he wished them the best of luck in the future. McBusted released their debut album, &quot;McBusted&quot;, on 1 December 2014. They then embarked on another sold out UK tour, McBusted&#x27;s Most Excellent Adventure Tour.

Willis also revealed that Busted had been approached to star in the ITV2 series &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, but turned it down because &quot;it didn&#x27;t feel right for our band.&quot;

===2015–2016: Simpson&#x27;s return, comeback tour and &quot;Night Driver&quot; ===
On 5 October 2015, &quot;The Sun&quot; rumoured that Simpson was set to rejoin Busted. After this, a photo made its way around the internet that showed the three members of Busted silhouetted in front of a red background. Words appeared to be blurred out at the bottom of the image, but above that was the words &quot;Join us for a special announcement Tuesday November 10th 2015&quot;. This implied that the band was reuniting, with further speculation that the three would embark on a reunion tour together. On 10 November 2015, Busted announced a thirteen-date arena tour in the UK and Ireland would take place in May 2016. At the same press conference Busted announced their third studio album. 100,000 tickets were sold in the first hour of being put on sale. Subsequent tour dates were added as a result of high demand.

Regarding his decision to rejoin the band, Simpson told &quot;Newsbeat&quot;: &quot;I reckon I said it [so many times], privately and publicly, and I meant it every single time. But as I say I have changed my mind and that has been down to the circumstances changing. I never thought we would get to a point where we were in a studio writing music we all got behind creatively and that was a huge shock to me&quot;.

In early 2016, Busted recorded their third studio album in Los Angeles. On 17 March 2016, Bourne told a fan on Twitter that Busted would decide the release date for their third album that day. It is scheduled for release in the Autumn. The band have also insisted that their reunion is for the long-term; as Bourne told Digital Spy, &quot;We want this to be something that is ongoing. Anything we write now goes towards album four&quot;. On 4 April 2016, Busted announced that their tour would be called the Pigs Can Fly Tour 2016 and would include Wheatus and Emma Blackery as special guests. Regarding the title, Willis told &quot;Newsbeat&quot;, &quot;The whole pigs can fly thing sums up how we feel about this. There have been times that we thought Busted could never, ever possibly happen and we were quite right in thinking that. But this summarises that anything is possible&quot;. In an interview with Digital Spy, the band revealed that their fans will get a taste of their new sound before their reunion tour and that their eleventh single will be released in the summer, and their album would follow in the autumn.

On 25 April 2016, it was officially announced that South African drummer Cobus Potgieter, popular on YouTube, would be the supporting drummer for the band during the tour. On 3 May, Busted released &quot;Coming Home&quot;, their first new song for 12 years, as a free download from their website. During the &#x27;Pigs Can Fly&#x27; tour, Busted premiered two new tracks titled &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;One of a Kind&quot;, from the upcoming 2016 album. Chalmers, president of East West, said: &quot;Watching Busted play live over the past few weeks and seeing people respond to their music and energy has been amazing. Busted have a huge global fanbase who are going to be really excited to hear the new music the guys are working on. They&#x27;ve managed to combine the classic Busted sound with a modern twist, it&#x27;s sure to remind people of why they love them. We&#x27;re really happy to be working with Charlie, Matt and James&quot;.

On 14 July 2016, Busted revealed that the &quot;final touches&quot; to the album were complete.

On 18 August 2016, it was announced by BBC News that a musical based on the band&#x27;s history written by Bourne and Elliot Davis was to be staged, &quot;What I Go to School For&quot; will depict the group&#x27;s rise to fame. It will be performed at the Theatre Royal Brighton in August 2016 and will feature songs like Air Hostess, Crashed the Wedding and Year 3000. If the show is a success Bourne and Davis have said they would like to take it to the West End.

On 9 September 2016, Busted revealed that their third album would be called &quot;Night Driver&quot;.

On 3 May 2016, &quot;Coming Home&quot; was released as a promotional single from the album. On 30 September 2016, &quot;On What You&#x27;re On&quot; was released as the first official single from the album. Another song, entitled &quot;Easy&quot;, was unveiled on 18 October 2016. Two days later, on 20 October 2016, Busted announced that due to production delays, the album release would be pushed back to 25 November 2016. The same day, Busted released a video for &quot;Easy&quot; filmed live at Pool Studios.

On 23 October 2016, the band made their first TV performance in over 12 years on &quot;The X Factor&quot; to perform &quot;Year 3000&quot; with the contestants.

===2017–2022: &quot;Half Way There&quot; and hiatus===
In June 2017 Busted flew to Los Angeles to perform their first American re-formed gig at the Troubadour and continue writing and begin recording for their planned fourth album.

In April 2018, it was confirmed the album would release in early 2019, and the band would return to their original sound. In May that year, Cobus Potgieter, who had previously stood in as drummer on Busted&#x27;s 2016 tour, announced that he would be the studio drummer for the upcoming fourth album.

On 26 October 2018, Busted announced that their fourth album, &quot;Half Way There&quot; (a reference to a lyric in the song &quot;Year 3000&quot;), would be released on 8 February 2019. The album features a cover of James Bourne&#x27;s song, &quot;What Happened to Your Band&quot;, which was previously performed by his band Son of Dork and recorded by McBusted, and returns to the roots of their musical style. The first single of the album, &quot;Nineties&quot;, was released in the first week of November 2018. Additional songs from the album, &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;All My Friends&quot;, were released 14 and 15 December respectively (the latter was an exclusive release for those that had pre-ordered the album from the band&#x27;s online store). In January 2019, Busted released their second single for the album, &quot;Radio&quot;. This was accompanied by a music video.

The band performed a secret set at Slam Dunk Festival in May 2019, on the Key Club Stage (Right). The band performed under the pseudonym &quot;Y3K&quot;, a reference to their song Year 3000.

On 8 June 2019, Busted were invited up on stage to perform &quot;Year 3000&quot; with the Jonas Brothers at Capital&#x27;s Summertime Ball 2019 as special guests.

On 31 December 2019, Bourne announced a new solo project, tweeting &quot;After twenty amazing years making music, I am stepping into 2020 on a brand new solo adventure. Busted will always be my band. But, I&#x27;ve dreamed for years about releasing my own album so here we go.&quot; His debut album, &quot;Safe Journey Home&quot;, was released on 23 October 2020. The album was followed-up with &quot;Sugar Beach&quot;, released in 2022. Simpson released a solo single called &quot;I See You&quot;. His fourth solo album, &quot;Hope Is a Drug&quot;, was released in 2022. Alongside this, Simpson also set up a Patreon where he uploads exclusive tracks including new music and covers. During the hiatus, Willis continued his acting career, appearing in stage productions such as &quot;Waitress&quot; and &quot;2:22 A Ghost Story&quot;.

===2023–present: 20th Anniversary Tour and collaborations===
On 21 March 2023, the band posted a teaser on their social media platforms for an announcement to be unveiled on 23 March, putting an end to their hiatus. That morning, they announced the 20th Anniversary &amp; Greatest Hits Tour, a 15-date UK tour for September 2023. A single was also announced alongside the tour announcement: &quot;Loser Kid 2.0,&quot; a re-recording of a song from their debut album featuring Simple Plan, set to release 14 April. An album of other re-recorded Busted classics featuring other artists, including McFly, All Time Low and Neck Deep, is set to be released as well. After selling out the initial 15-date tour, the band announced 11 additional dates in the UK and Ireland to meet demand, extending the tour until 10 October, with Hanson being the opening act of some of the dates, including the London O2 concerts.

On 14 April 2023, Busted released a version of &quot;Loser Kid&quot;, the closing track of their 2002 self-titled debut album, titled &quot;Loser Kid 2.0&quot; featuring Canadian band Simple Plan. This version peaked at number 13 on the UK Singles Sales Chart. On 5 May 2023, Busted released &quot;Meet You There 2.0&quot;, a pop-punk version of their 2003 album track, featuring Welsh pop-punk band Neck Deep. On 26 May 2023, Busted released a cover version of the 1997 Hanson hit &quot;MMMBop&quot;, in collaboration with the latter band, titled &quot;MMMBop 2.0&quot;. On 23 June 2023, Busted released a version of their 2003 hit &quot;Crashed the Wedding&quot;, titled &quot;Crashed the Wedding 2.0,&quot; featuring American band All Time Low. On 28 July 2023, they released a version of their 2002 hit &quot;Year 3000&quot; titled &quot;Year 3000 2.0&quot;, featuring the Jonas Brothers on guest vocals. &quot;Greatest Hits 2.0&quot;, a collaborative album of re-recordings of songs from Busted&#x27;s first two albums, was made available for pre-order on 28 July 2023. The album reached number 1 in the UK album charts on 22 September 2023. In January 2024, it was announced Busted would be participating in Download Festival.

In July 2024, Busted announced their first-ever tour of Australia, with shows in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne in October and November 2024.

Busted and McFly announced &quot;Busted vs McFly&quot; on 9 October 2024, marking the first time all seven members would perform together since 2003.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Busted&#x27;s genre has been described as pop rock, pop-punk and college rock. Although the band were often referred to as a boy band, Simpson, Bourne and Willis would often reject that label. Simpson stated &#x27;Those clichés are everything the band wasn&#x27;t, because we hated them. We hated the machine of pop, we split up at the height of our fame, they were talking about us putting on a Wembley Stadium gig and we gave it up.&#x27; The sound of their first two albums were often compared to that of Wheatus, Blink-182 and Sum 41 and the band were complimented on the energy and enthusiasm brought to the studio and shows. When Busted returned to the pop punk sounds for Half Way There, Simpson noted that it was a style they tried to have when they were younger but the &#x27;record label wouldn&#x27;t allow it&#x27;. Busted&#x27;s attempts to mature their sound was noted by Simpson in a BBC Interview. He stated &#x27;I would go to the label and say, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got to turn the drums up, you can&#x27;t hear them and it doesn&#x27;t sound like a rock record, it sounds like a pop record&#x27;.

Their third album, &quot;Night Driver&quot;, was a departure from their original sound. &quot;NME&quot; noted upon the release of &quot;Coming Home&quot;, that the band were much more &#x27;synth-pop&#x27; influenced. Influence from the 1980s decade and Daft Punk were also noted. The group also branched out into R&amp;B and bass-heavy alternative pop.

Lyrically, Busted often references pop culture. Bourne stated &#x27;The pop culture references are a big part of what we do. On those early records, we’ve got Britney Spears and Dawson&#x27;s Creek in there, now we’re writing about Elon Musk. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s in our lives now&#x27;. Their song Year 3000 is also heavily influenced by Back to the Future. The band also described their style as &#x27;tongue in cheek&#x27;, stating that if you do that to &#x27;banging rock music&#x27; and that &#x27;When you do that, you can be silly, it really works&#x27;.

===Influences===
Busted have spoken about various influences for their sound and songwriting including Robbie Williams, Green Day, Michael Jackson and Blink-182. Simpson stated that the latter in particular was a &quot;big influence back in the day&quot;. Bourne also stated that Third Eye Blind was a &quot;major influence&quot; to the early days of the band. Upon announcing that Wheatus would be joining McBusted on tour in 2014, Willis stated that the band was a &quot;massive Busted influence&quot;.

==Legacy==
At the height of their popularity, Busted were often complimented for bringing in a wave of British pop rock. They were cited as bringing in &#x27;&quot;something fresh and new&quot; to the scene&#x27; of pop. They &#x27;broke with that trend of the all-singing, all-dancing boy group that was around&#x27;, instead pioneering a revival in interest of the guitar. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; cited Busted as a positive influence on kids getting into rock. Simpson also spoke in 2019 about being told of an increase in guitar sales during Busted&#x27;s heyday. Willis also mentioned that many upcoming indie bands and fans had spoken to him, stating that: &quot;I meet them and they’ll say, ‘The first song I learned to play was What I Go to School For, and, ‘the first time I picked up a guitar was playing Busted tab’. 
That was amazing to me because I did that with Oasis chord books. It was so cool to hear people did that with our band.&quot; Their first two albums went Multi-Platinum and they achieved four number ones in the UK Charts. In 2004, Busted won Best British Breakthrough BRIT Award.

The band&#x27;s reunion tour in 2016 required extra dates after selling out within an hour.

Busted have been cited as influences for The Vamps and 5 Seconds of Summer. They have also been cited as one of the reasons musician Emma Blackery &#x27;picked up a guitar&#x27;. Blackery went on to tour with the band during the Pigs Can Fly Tour in 2016. Pop rock band Natives have been vocally thankful to Busted, and particularly Matt Willis for &#x27;fighting their corner&#x27;.

Busted have been called instrumental in the formation of British pop rock band McFly. After the record label declined Tom Fletcher&#x27;s participation in the band, he was offered a space on the song writing team for the first two albums. Fletcher credits James Bourne as teaching him the structure of a pop hit. After Busted&#x27;s split, McFly were often referred to as Busted&#x27;s successor. &quot;Year 3000&quot; and &quot;What I Go to School For&quot; were also covered by the pop band Jonas Brothers. Their cover of &quot;Year 3000&quot; was a lead single from their first album and a commercial success.

Busted were mentioned directly by singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi as being an influence to his own artistry.

<text>John Coger&quot;Jackie&quot;Martling Jr. (born February 14, 1944) is an American stand-up comedian, writer, radio personality, author, actor, and musician also known as Jackie the Joke Man. He is best known as a former writer and in-studio comedian for &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; from 1983 to 2001.

Born and raised on Long Island, New York, Martling began a career in stand-up comedy in 1979, developing a blue comedy act in local venues. He self-produced his first of three comedy albums, &quot;What Did You Expect?&quot; (1979), during this time. After becoming involved with Rick Dees&#x27;s radio show as a regular joke feature, Martling sent his albums to New York City radio personality Howard Stern, who invited him as a weekly guest and writer in 1983. This led to his hiring as head writer from 1986 to 2001. He released further albums during his tenure, including &quot;Sgt. Pecker&quot; (1996), &quot;Joke Man&quot; (1996), &quot;Hot Dogs + Donuts&quot; (1998).

Since his departure from &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Martling has undertaken various projects, including acting roles in television and film, and continues to perform stand-up. From 2006 to 2014, he was the host of &quot;Jackie&#x27;s Joke Hunt&quot; on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, on Howard Stern&#x27;s channel. He released his first music album, &quot;Happy Endings&quot; (2008). Martling has written two books, &quot;Disgustingly Dirty Joke Book&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Joke Man: Bow to Stern&quot; (2017).

==Early life==
Martling was born on February 14, 1944, in Mineola, New York, a village on Long Island. The eldest of four children, he is of English, French, and Dutch ancestry. Martling took up music at seventh grade and spent time as a gymnast in his youth. He attended James H. Vernon School in East Norwich, New York, followed by Oyster Bay High School and, in 1971, earned a mechanical engineering degree from Michigan State University. After graduating, he stayed in East Lansing, Michigan, for a further two years. During his time in college, Martling was the singer and guitarist in a band. He quit the group and spent six months in Denver, Colorado, working in construction.

==Career==

===Early career===
After returning to New York, Martling became the singer and guitarist in The Off-Hour Rockers with guitarist Chris Bates and keyboardist Herbie Werner, with whom incorporated jokes, banjos, and the kazoo in their sets. He also performed solo shows and told jokes during his act. In order to accommodate the band&#x27;s gear, Martling drove a used hearse. Martling took stand-up comedy more seriously when, in 1976, he attended an open-mic night at Catch a Rising Star comedy club in New York City. &quot;The auditioner bailed out early and the MC wasn&#x27;t in the room, so I jumped on stage and told a joke, one that I was sure the entire world knew. The MC, David Sayh, came back in the room and saw me up there but let me finish&quot;. Sayh encouraged Martling to continue performing as a joke teller, and soon found out that &quot;few people knew any of the zillions of jokes I knew&quot;.

By 1979, Bates and Werner disbanded the Off Hour Rockers to start a new group. At that point, Martling started to pursue stand-up comedy full-time, developing his stage act of songs and dirty jokes. During a gig at My Father&#x27;s Place in Roslyn, New York, Martling met the likes of comedians Eddie Murphy, Rob Bartlett, and Bob Nelson who would perform for several minutes at Martling&#x27;s gigs. In 1979, he set up a &quot;dial-a-joke&quot; telephone line from his parents&#x27; attic, Jackie&#x27;s &quot;Use Your Finger! (516) 922-WINE&quot;, which remains in operation to this day. Also in 1979, Martling released his first comedy album, &quot;What Did You Expect?!&quot; (1979), which he recorded himself using his own recording equipment. This was followed by &quot;Goin&#x27; Ape!&quot; (1980).
Martling made a breakthrough in 1981 when Dave Lipson, writer and producer of Rick Dees&#x27;s morning radio show on KIIS in Los Angeles, discovered his joke line and played his daily joke updates on Dees&#x27;s program. The exposure led Martling to star in a designated joke segment for Dees, who went on to give Martling his nickname, &quot;The Joke Man&quot;. Also in 1981, Martling released his third album, &quot;Normal People Are People You Don&#x27;t Know That Well&quot; (1981).

===&quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;===
Martling first heard of radio personality Howard Stern in August 1982 when the owner of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Garvin&#x27;s comedy club, where Stern had occasionally broadcast from during his time at WWDC (DC-101), suggested to Martling that he send his comedy albums to the recently fired radio DJ who had since landed at WNBC in New York City. By early 1983, Martling had mailed his three comedy albums to Howard Stern, then less than a year into his stint in afternoons at WNBC. Stern took a liking to Martling&#x27;s material and invited him on as a guest in February 1983, which soon turned into a weekly guest spot without pay. Stern then began a regular segment titled &quot;Stump The Comedian&quot;, a contest where callers were challenged to start a joke that Martling had to provide the punchline to, otherwise they win prizes.

In 1985, following the show&#x27;s cancellation from WNBC, Stern stayed in New York City and relocated to afternoons on WXRK. Martling was subsequently hired as a writer on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; when it moved to the mornings slot in February 1986, initially for two days a week. After around two months, Martling was hired full-time and became known as the head writer who would take lines written by himself and sound effects and producer Fred Norris and &quot;determine what goes in front of Howard&quot;. Along with Norris, Martling contributed material to radio bits and song parodies and is featured and credited on Stern&#x27;s television shows, home videos, and albums. In 1994, a puppet that resembled Martling, known on the show as the &quot;Jackie puppet&quot; and voiced by show impressionist Billy West, began to feature on the newly-launched &quot;Howard Stern&quot; television program on the E! channel.

Martling would release further albums during his time on the show, including &quot;Sgt. Pecker&quot; (1996), &quot;Joke Man&quot; (1996), &quot;Hot Dogs + Donuts&quot; (1998), and &quot;F Jackie&quot; (2000).

From late 1997 to early 1998, Martling was absent on the show for six weeks while his contract with WXRK owner Infinity Broadcasting Corporation was being renegotiated. During this time, he refused to be filmed on the E! television show until he had also secured a contract from the channel. Martling had taken time off to negotiate his contract &quot;three or four times&quot; throughout his time on the show.

In February 2001, Martling made history when he became the first comedian to perform at the B.B. King Blues Club in New York City.

On March 5, 2001, Stern announced Martling&#x27;s departure from the show after negotiations fell through once more. Martling, who was earning $578,000 at the time, asked for a salary that averaged $1 million per year over the next five years. He declined the station&#x27;s final offer of $650,000 on the advice of his lawyer. Martling twice attempted to accept the offer once the deadline to accept had passed, and he was declined. He has since added other reasons to his departure, including his inability to sleep and perform effectively for the show, having to announce his failing marriage on the air, and the inability to address his alcohol abuse had he continued. In August 2001, a newspaper reported his wish to return, but Stern declined, partly due to the Win Jackie&#x27;s Money contest he had already started, which involved comedians auditioning for Martling&#x27;s place in the studio by sitting in on some shows. In October 2001, comedian and actor Artie Lange replaced Martling for a tenure that lasted until December 2009.

Following his departure, Martling returned as a guest during the show&#x27;s final week on terrestrial radio prior to its relocation to Sirius Satellite Radio, on December 15, 2005. He returned to the show on Sirius on March 13, 2007, and has since returned in the studio and by phone. A two-day special on Martling&#x27;s time on the show titled &quot;Stern Spotlight: Jackie Martling&quot; aired in May 2007.

===Later career===
Since 1993, he has released six 78-minute dirty joke CDs, three videos, a DVD (&quot;A Safe Distance from Genius&quot;), five joke books including 1998&#x27;s best-selling Simon &amp; Schuster title, &quot;Jackie &quot;The Joke Man&quot; Martling&#x27;s Disgustingly Dirty Joke Book&quot;, and the iPhone app &quot;The Jackie Button&quot;. He also co-created a line of electronic joke products with &quot;EB-Excalibur&quot;, and their &quot;MiniJokeMaster Jr.&quot; keychain is sold through various retailers.

Martling has appeared in many films during his career, including the comedy documentary &quot;The Aristocrats&quot; (2005), &quot;Mail Order Bride&quot; (2008), &quot;Venus &amp; Vegas&quot; (2010), and &quot;White Irish Drinkers&quot; (2010). He appeared in the short film &quot;Jokebitch&quot; (2005). Martling received a Best Supporting Actor Award at the New York International Independent Film &amp; Video Festival. He appeared on the TNT television show &quot;Leverage&quot; and in August 2007, Martling filmed the pilot episode for the sitcom &quot;The Pikers&quot;.

On October 3, 2006, Martling returned to radio as the host of a weekly, one hour comedy show, &quot;Jackie&#x27;s Joke Hunt&quot;, on Stern&#x27;s channel Howard 101 on Sirius. Martling&#x27;s co-host was a fellow member of the Friar&#x27;s Club, Ian &quot;McKean&quot; Karr. The final episode, &quot;The Last Lick Hunt&quot;, aired on November 25, 2014, after 402 shows. Martling can also be heard on the Sirius comedy channel Raw Dog Comedy.

Martling released his first music album, &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, in 2007, co-produced by guitarist Frank Vignola. From October 27 to November 4, 2008, Martling and &quot;American Idol&quot; runner-up Bo Bice entertained American troops in Kuwait and Iraq. In 2010, Martling wrote and performed a one-man show for a run in New York City titled &quot;JokeLand on Broadway&quot;. In 2012, he appeared in Fred Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Send No Flowers&quot;, the short film &quot;My Cross to Bear&quot;, and voiced two puppets in the human/puppet film &quot;The Fuzz&quot;.

Martling&#x27;s second book (an autobiography), &quot;The Joke Man: Bow to Stern&quot;, was released on October 24, 2017. Lange, who replaced Martling on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; from 2001 to 2009, wrote the book&#x27;s foreword.

Martling posts a joke on his Twitter account every day at 4:20 p.m.

==Personal life==
From 1988 to 2008, Jackie Martling was married to Nancy Sirianni, though they were separated for years before. Their personal life as well as her appearances and call-ins to The Howard Stern Show contributed greatly to their popularity and put Jackie and Nancy in a spotlight they had not previously enjoyed. Nancy Sirianni&#x27;s musical endeavors with her band, The Scoldees (and before that her bands All Folked Up and Big Orange Marble), were played on Stern&#x27;s radio show and discussed by Howard and his staff. In 2008, Martling and Sirianni continued their professional association with an Off-Off-Broadway Broadway Game Show called &quot;Play With Jackie.&quot; Martling also had a cameo in a 1990 low-budget horror movie Nancy starred in called &quot;Ghoul School&quot;, which became another punchline for Stern.

<text>The Cherry Bowl was an annual post-season college football bowl game played in the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, in 1984 and 1985. The Cherry Bowl was an early attempt to bring a game to Michigan, years before the Motor City Bowl (later known as the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl) and its successor the Quick Lane Bowl (later known as the GameAbove Sports Bowl). 

==History==
The Cherry Bowl&#x27;s inaugural 1984 game drew more than 70,000 to an Army–Michigan State matchup. This game was noteworthy as Army&#x27;s first-ever bowl game appearance.

The mid-1980s were a time of upheaval in college football. The end of NCAA control over television rights resulted in a major increase in televised games, and TV rights fees dropped sharply amid the resulting glut, something not anticipated by the Cherry Bowl organizers. Adding to their problems, without the local Michigan State team, attendance for the 1985 game between Maryland and Syracuse fell by nearly 20,000. For 1985, the bowl promised $1.2 million to each team, the fifth-highest payout among all bowls.

The national anthem, half-time, and post-game shows were performed by area high school marching bands. For the 1984 game, the national anthem and the post-game show were performed by the Marching Railroaders from Durand, Michigan. The Clio Area High School Marching Band performed a pre-game show and joined the Marching Railroaders along with the Michigan State Marching Band to perform a holiday half-time show. 

Negotiations with General Motors to become the game&#x27;s title sponsor failed. Unable to meet its payout obligation and more than $1 million in debt, the Cherry Bowl folded after its second edition.

==Game summaries==

===1984 Cherry Bowl===
1984 saw the first edition of the Cherry Bowl, between Army and Michigan State. It was Army&#x27;s first bowl game in program history, and Michigan State&#x27;s first since the 1966 Rose Bowl.

The first quarter of the game ended without score; a second quarter 4-yard touchdown gave Army a 7–0 halftime lead. After a scoreless third quarter, Army converted a 35-yard FG in the 4th to extend its lead to 10–0. Michigan State attempted a comeback with a 36-yard touchdown, but a failed two-point conversion led to a 10–6 final.

===1985 Cherry Bowl===
The 1985 Cherry Bowl was the second and last to be played, this one contested by Maryland and Syracuse. The scoring opened in the 1st with a 26-yard Syracuse field goal. Maryland countered with a 4-yard touchdown run, making it 6–3. A 10-yard run in the 2nd gave Syracuse a 10–6 lead; however, the Terrapins overpowered Syracuse, scoring 29 consecutive points, and Syracuse was unable to rally in a 35–18 Maryland victory.

<text>The Aviation Bowl was a post-season college football bowl game played at Welcome Stadium in Dayton, Ohio, on December 9, 1961, between the New Mexico Lobos and the Western Michigan Broncos. New Mexico won by a score of 28 to 12. Attendance for the game was 3,694.

==Background==
The Lobos finished tied for third for Mountain States Conference in their final season in the conference. The Broncos had finished tied for second in the Mid-American Conference. This was New Mexico&#x27;s first bowl game since the 1947 Harbor Bowl and Western Michigan&#x27;s first ever bowl game. Rutgers and The Citadel were asked to play in the game, but they both declined. Bowling Green was considered to play, but they instead played in the Mercy Bowl, a fundraiser in memory of the members of the Cal Poly team members that died the year before, after playing Bowling Green. Ohio was in the running as well, but they tied their last game against Western Michigan, 20–20. The two inch snowfall that fell prior to the game turned to sleet during the game, making the field wet.

==Game summary==
* New Mexico - Cromartie 3 yard touchdown run (kick blocked)
* New Mexico - Santiago 10 yard touchdown run (Morgan run)
* Western Michigan - White 4 yard touchdown run (run failed)
* New Mexico - Morgan 10 yard touchdown run (run failed)
* New Mexico - Cummings 43 yard interception for touchdown (Bradford run)
* Western Michigan - Cooke 5 yard touchdown pass from Chlebek (pass failed)

<doc id="384622" wikidata="Q1169885" url="?curid=384622" title="Lewis E. Platt">
<text>Lewis Emmett Platt (April 11, 1941 – September 8, 2005) was an American businessman and corporate director, who was chairman, president and chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard.

==Personal life and education==
Platt was born in Johnson City, New York, the son of Margaret (Williams) and Norval Lewis Platt. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University in 1964 and his MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1966. He was granted an honorary doctorate in Engineering Science by Santa Clara University. He was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega National Fraternity and served on its National Foundation Board of Governors.

Platt was widowed early in 1981. His wife died of cancer, and leaving him to raise two young daughters. This life change is said to have informed policies accommodating employee needs that he later implemented as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.
== Career at Hewlett-Packard ==
Platt joined Hewlett-Packard (HP) as an engineer in the medical products division. In the 1980s, he rose through the ranks in HP&#x27;s Computer Systems Organization (CSO), becoming executive vice president overseeing HP&#x27;s Computer Products Sector in 1988, and head of the CSO in 1990. Under Platt&#x27;s watch, HP made a major investment in RISC/Unix which brought tens of billions in revenue and made the company a major IT provider.

Platt succeeded John A. Young as president and chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard in 1992, and then succeeded co-founder David Packard as the company&#x27;s chairman of the board in 1993.

Under Platt&#x27;s tenure as CEO, HP&#x27;s sales went from $20 billion in 1993 to $38 billion in 1996. During his seven years as CEO, revenues increased 187 percent to $47.1 billion. Despite his corporate successes, Platt was not considered media-savvy due his thick glasses and hulking frame and generally kept a low profile, although he did agree to sit atop of a bunch of crates on the roof of an HP building for a BusinessWeek cover story in 1995.
Platt was known as an embodiment of the &quot;HP Way&quot;, a management philosophy developed by company founders Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, that &quot;built on respect for every individual and on the notion that people want to do their best — and will, if given the right direction&quot;. Platt was noted to being attuned to the company&#x27;s rank-and-file as he practiced &quot;management by walking around&quot;, as he flew commercial airlines instead of using the corporate jet. He also ate in the company cafeteria with the employees on a regular basis.

Late in his tenure, Platt was often criticized by investors and some HP executives for focusing on progressive values and long-term results. Platt&#x27;s detractors said that company needed a more cold-blooded competitiveness and higher octane leadership to succeed, that his &quot;pragmatic, nothing-fancy approach&quot; seemed out of touch with the &quot;go-go demands of the late 1990s,&quot; and that he had failed to capitalize on the Internet boom. Platt, who had announced back in March 1999 that he intended to resign and spin off HP&#x27;s test and measurement group into Agilent, said in a July 1999 interview, &quot;even before the announcement of the splitting of the company and the new CEO, we had spent a lot of time looking at ourselves. We needed to make some cultural shifts.&quot; Platt said, &quot;We needed to hold fast to the core values but change some of the practices. (We needed to) speed up decision making.&quot; 
In March 1999, HP&#x27;s board had initiated a search for Platt&#x27;s successor as CEO which would eventually be Carly Fiorina who came from Lucent Technologies. Although Platt was instrumental in hiring Fiorina, he was viewed as a &quot;has been&quot; as she reportedly stopped seeking his advice a few weeks after she joined HP.

Fiorina&#x27;s tenure was rocked by numerous disappointments, including her propensity to over-promise and her difficulty in taking advice from others, and she was ousted in 2005. Furthermore, she was perceived as aloof, as she was an outsider to the HP culture, and also as a result of her high visibility and &quot;rock star status&quot; in the press which led to the board of directors complaining that she was &quot;spending too much time on the road, neglecting the nuts-and-bolts execution of her own strategic ideas&quot;. Fiorina&#x27;s firing was also viewed as a vindication of Platt&#x27;s previously-derided style, as a reporter remarked &quot;While big egos and business cycles come and go, the values Platt held dear are timeless, and should not be easily dismissed&quot;.

Upon his departure in July 1999 as CEO and in 2000 as board chairman, his position was divided into three, partially because of the Agilent Technologies divestiture. Richard Hackborn served as chairman of both HP and Agilent during the transitional period of the breakup, but the two companies had separate CEOs.

==Civic engagement==
In 1997, &quot;Lewis E. Platt was appointed to the Advisory
Committee on Trade Policy Negotiations by President Bill Clinton and
served as chairman of one of its task forces, the World Trade Organization Task Force...
In 1996, Lewis E. Platt was elected cochair and a member
of the board of directors of Joint Venture Silicon Valley and the
Tech Network, formed in 1991, to strengthen the local economy and
make the area a better place to live, and he was a member of The Business Council, also serving as a member of the California Business Roundtable from 1993 to 1995...&quot; In 1996 he employed company resources, his personal energy, and his fundraising skills to campaign for successful local ballot questions to increase sales tax earmarked for local transportation improvements.

== Career after 1999 ==
=== Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates ===
After retiring from HP he served as CEO of Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates from 2000 to mid-2001.

=== Boeing Company ===
On December 1, 2003, director Platt was named as the non-executive chairman of Boeing, after Phil Condit resigned as chairman and CEO. In 2005, Platt was instrumental in forcing out President and CEO Harry Stonecipher for violating company rules, after it was revealed that Stonecipher was having an extramarital relationship with a female executive.

== Death ==
On September 8, 2005, Platt died of a brain aneurysm at his home in Petaluma, California. He was 64.

==Legacy==
A resolution of the state legislature named a section of California State Route 87 the Lewis E. Platt Memorial Highway.

The Aggies, coached by Harry Stiteler, entered the contest with a 6–4 record. A&amp;M had posted victories over Nevada, Texas Tech, VMI, TCU, Arkansas, and SMU; while dropping contests against Oklahoma, Baylor, Rice, and Texas. The game was A&amp;M&#x27;s first post-season appearance since a 19–14 defeat at the hands of LSU in the 1944 Orange Bowl. Having posted records of 0–9–1 and 1–8–1 in his first two seasons in College Station, the 1950 season marked a huge turn-around for Stiteler&#x27;s program. Prior to the bowl game, he reported that he was attacked and beaten by a stranger near the Shamrock Hotel in Houston, where Stiteler had been scheduled to address a group of Texas A&amp;M alumni. A press report stated that he did not provide details to the police.

Meanwhile, in Athens, Coach Wally Butts&#x27; Bulldogs had scratched out a 6–2–3 record. The Red &amp; Black enjoyed victories over Maryland, Mississippi State, Boston College, Florida, Auburn, and Furman; fought to ties with Saint Mary&#x27;s, North Carolina, and LSU; and lost 14–7 against Alabama, and 7–0 to Georgia Tech. The trip to College Park was Georgia&#x27;s 7th bowl venture, and would be UGA&#x27;s first December bowl outing.

==Game summary==
Bob Smith opened the game with a 100-yard kickoff return for a score and added an 81-yard scoring run as A&amp;M jumped to a 33–0 halftime lead on five touchdowns, two by Smith and Tidwell. Smith totalled 160 yards on 20 carries for the day along with 121 yards in punt returns, 22 yards receiving and five yards passing to accumulate 301 total yards. Tidwell added his third score to make it 40–0 before Georgia managed to score 20 of their own. But it was not enough, as A&amp;M won in Stiteler&#x27;s final game as coach.

==Aftermath==
Three months later, it was revealed by Stiteler admitted that he had misrepresented the facts concerning the assault. He reported that he had known his attacker and &quot;the affair was a personal one.&quot; Stiteler submitted his letter of resignation to the President of Texas A&amp;M upon revealing the facts concerning &quot;my affair in Houston.&quot;

A&amp;M would not reach a bowl game for another 7 years, the 1957 Gator Bowl. The Bulldogs would not reach one again until 1959.

<text>A fancy cancel is a postal cancellation that includes an artistic design. Although the term may be used of modern machine cancellations that include artwork, it primarily refers to the designs carved in cork and used in 19th century post offices of the United States.

When postage stamps were introduced in the US in 1847, postmasters were required to deface them to prevent reuse, but it was left up to them to decide exactly how to do this, and not infrequently clerks would use whatever was at hand, including pens and &quot;PAID&quot; handstamps left over from the pre-stamp era.

A number of offices began to use cork bottle stoppers dipped in ink. These worked well, but would tend to blot out the entire stamp making it difficult to check the denomination, and so clerks began to carve a groove across the middle of the cork, making two semicircles. Further enhancements included two grooves cut crosswise (the four-piece &quot;country pie&quot;), and then two more, for the eight-segment &quot;city pie&quot;, and notches cut out of the outer edge to lighten the cancel further.

The carving process seems to have sparked the creativity of clerks across the country, and soon thousands of designs appeared, ranging from shields to skulls to stars, geometrical shapes, animals, plants, and devils with pitchforks. Among the most common fancy cancel designs are &quot;stars&quot; and &quot;crosses&quot; of varying designs. The Waterbury, Connecticut post office was the master of the practice, and turned out new cancels for every holiday and special occasion. Their &quot;Waterbury Running Chicken&quot; cancel, perhaps a turkey since it appeared close to Thanksgiving of 1869, was in use for only a few days and is now the most prized of all 19th century cancels, with covers fetching very high prices.

The era of fancy cancels came to an end in the 1890s, when the Post Office Department issued new regulations standardizing the form of cancellations.

The fancy cancels have since been studied and categorized by specialists. Many types are quite common, and command only a small premium, while others are rare. Not all have been discovered yet; previously unknown cancels continue to surface regularly.

Fancy cancels exist for many other countries besides the US. Outside the US they are normally termed cork cancellations. Canadian cork cancellations are famous for their fancy designs. Cork cancellations can be found on stamps issued by British Colonies including the Cape of Good Hope.

<text>The Raisin Bowl was an annual post-season American college football bowl game played at Ratcliffe Stadium in Fresno, California, from 1946 to 1949. The first four games were played on January 1, the last on December 31. The games pitted a California team against an at-large team; the California team prevailed in four of the five games.

This game is not to be confused with the California Bowl which was later staged in Fresno, which in its later years was marketed as the California Raisin Bowl due to the sale of naming rights to the California Raisin Marketing Board.

<doc id="384644" wikidata="Q225527" url="?curid=384644" title="Ramification (mathematics)">
<text>In geometry, ramification is &#x27;branching out&#x27;, in the way that the square root function, for complex numbers, can be seen to have two &quot;branches&quot; differing in sign. The term is also used from the opposite perspective (branches coming together) as when a covering map degenerates at a point of a space, with some collapsing of the fibers of the mapping.

==In complex analysis==
In complex analysis, the basic model can be taken as the &quot;z&quot; → &quot;z&quot;&quot;n&quot; mapping in the complex plane, near &quot;z&quot; = 0. This is the standard local picture in Riemann surface theory, of ramification of order &quot;n&quot;. It occurs for example in the Riemann–Hurwitz formula for the effect of mappings on the genus.

==In algebraic topology==

In a covering map the Euler–Poincaré characteristic should multiply by the number of sheets; ramification can therefore be detected by some dropping from that. The &quot;z&quot; → &quot;z&quot;&quot;n&quot; mapping shows this as a local pattern: if we exclude 0, looking at 0 &lt; |&quot;z&quot;| &lt; 1 say, we have (from the homotopy point of view) the circle mapped to itself by the &quot;n&quot;-th power map (Euler–Poincaré characteristic 0), but with the whole disk the Euler–Poincaré characteristic is 1, &quot;n&quot; – 1 being the &#x27;lost&#x27; points as the &quot;n&quot; sheets come together at &quot;z&quot; = 0. 

In geometric terms, ramification is something that happens in &quot;codimension two&quot; (like knot theory, and monodromy); since &quot;real&quot; codimension two is &quot;complex&quot; codimension one, the local complex example sets the pattern for higher-dimensional complex manifolds. In complex analysis, sheets can&#x27;t simply fold over along a line (one variable), or codimension one subspace in the general case. The ramification set (branch locus on the base, double point set above) will be two real dimensions lower than the ambient manifold, and so will not separate it into two &#x27;sides&#x27;, locally―there will be paths that trace round the branch locus, just as in the example. In algebraic geometry over any field, by analogy, it also happens in algebraic codimension one.

==In algebraic number theory==
=== In algebraic extensions of the rational numbers ===
Ramification in algebraic number theory means a prime ideal factoring in an extension so as to give some repeated prime ideal factors. Namely, let formula_1 be the ring of integers of an algebraic number field formula_2, and formula_3 a prime ideal of formula_1. For a field extension formula_5 we can consider the
ring of integers formula_6 (which is the integral closure of formula_1 in formula_8), and the ideal formula_9 of formula_6. This ideal may or may not be prime, but for finite formula_11, it has a factorization into prime ideals:

:formula_12

where the formula_13 are distinct prime ideals of formula_6. Then formula_3 is said to ramify in formula_8 if formula_17 for some formula_18; otherwise it is . In other words, formula_3 ramifies in formula_8 if the ramification index formula_21 is greater than one for some formula_13. An equivalent condition is that formula_23 has a non-zero nilpotent element: it is not a product of finite fields. The analogy with the Riemann surface case was already pointed out by Richard Dedekind and Heinrich M. Weber in the nineteenth century.

The ramification is encoded in formula_2 by the relative discriminant and in formula_8 by the relative different. The former is an ideal of formula_1 and is divisible by formula_3 if and only if some ideal formula_13 of formula_6 dividing formula_3 is ramified. The latter is an ideal of formula_6 and is divisible by the prime ideal formula_13 of formula_6 precisely when formula_13 is ramified.

The ramification is tame when the ramification indices formula_21 are all relatively prime to the residue characteristic &quot;p&quot; of formula_3, otherwise wild. This condition is important in Galois module theory. A finite generically étale extension formula_37 of Dedekind domains is tame if and only if the trace formula_38 is surjective.

===In local fields===
The more detailed analysis of ramification in number fields can be carried out using extensions of the p-adic numbers, because it is a &quot;local&quot; question. In that case a quantitative measure of ramification is defined for Galois extensions, basically by asking how far the Galois group moves field elements with respect to the metric. A sequence of ramification groups is defined, reifying (amongst other things) &quot;wild&quot; (non-tame) ramification. This goes beyond the geometric analogue.

==In algebra==

In valuation theory, the ramification theory of valuations studies the set of extensions of a valuation of a field &quot;K&quot; to an extension field of &quot;K&quot;. This generalizes the notions in algebraic number theory, local fields, and Dedekind domains.

==In algebraic geometry==
There is also corresponding notion of unramified morphism in algebraic geometry. It serves to define étale morphisms.

Let formula_39 be a morphism of schemes. The support of the quasicoherent sheaf formula_40 is called the ramification locus of formula_41 and the image of the ramification locus, formula_42, is called the branch locus of formula_41. If formula_44 we say that formula_41 is formally unramified and if formula_41 is also of locally finite presentation we say that formula_41 is unramified (see ).

<text>The Center for Defense Information (CDI) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization based in Washington, D.C. It specialized in analyzing and advising on military matters.

==History==
The Center for Defense Information was founded in 1971 by an independent group of retired military officers including Adm. Gene La Rocque and Adm. Eugene Carroll.

In 2005, the Center for Defense Information expanded by creating the Straus Military Reform Project for the purpose of promoting military reform in the Pentagon and Congress. Winslow T. Wheeler, a former Capitol Hill staffer and General Accounting Office assistant director, directs the Straus Military Reform Project at CDI. The Project was launched by a matching grant from Philip A. Straus Jr. Straus and his family have long supported activities at CDI and continue to be major supporters of the Project&#x27;s endeavors. In May 2012, CDI joined the Project on Government Oversight.

After the 2008 United States elections, CDI released &quot;America’s Defense Meltdown: Pentagon Reform for President Obama and the New Congress&quot;, a collection of briefing papers by a dozen defense intellectuals and retired military officers. In 2010, CDI released a second anthology, &quot;The Pentagon Labyrinth: 10 Short Essays to Help You through It&quot;. Since the mid-2000s, CDI has focused on the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II as what it says is the embodiment of the Pentagon&#x27;s acquisition problems—being both unaffordable and a huge disappointment in performance.

Formerly, CDI operated under the umbrella of the World Security Institute. In 2012, the World Security Institute closed, and CDI merged with the Project On Government Oversight (POGO). In addition, POGO continued the publication of &quot;The Defense Monitor&quot;.

<doc id="384655" wikidata="Q7085816" url="?curid=384655" title="Ole C. Johnson">
<text>Ole Carl Johnson Shipnes (February 23, 1838November 4, 1886) was a Norwegian American immigrant, businessman, Republican politician, and Wisconsin pioneer. He was the first immigration commissioner of Wisconsin, serving from 1871 through 1873, and was the 17th mayor of Beloit, Wisconsin (1877–1879). During the American Civil War, he served with the 15th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment (the &quot;Scandinavian Regiment&quot;), he was a prisoner of war for half a year before escaping and returning to the regiment, which he then led as lieutenant colonel.

For most of his career in America, he was known to use the surname &quot;Johnson&quot;, but added the surname &quot;Shipnes&quot;—an Anglicization of his Norwegian birthplace—later in life.

==Early life==
Ole Johnson was born on the Skipnes Farm, (&quot;Skibsnes&quot;), near Nordsjø, in Helgen Parish, Telemark, Norway. He came to the United States with his parents and four siblings, arriving in New York on board the &quot;Salvator&quot;, on July 6, 1844. The family went to Whitewater, Walworth County, Wisconsin. In 1852, they moved to Koshkonong, Wisconsin. Johnson studied law at Beloit College. He became a school teacher in Stoughton.

==Civil War==
When the Civil War broke out, Johnson joined the Scandinavian Regiment (15th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment) and was appointed captain of Company B. After the Battle of Perryville, Johnson was promoted to the rank of major. He took part in the battle of Murfreesboro and reached the rank of lieutenant colonel in March 1863. The Scandavian Regiment was heavily mauled at the battle of Chickamauga with approximately 63% killed, wounded, or captured. Colonel Hans Christian Heg who had commanded the Regiment since its formation was killed and Johnson was captured.

Johnson was held in Libby Prison in Virginia before it was decided in May 1864 to move him to another prison. At Chesterville, Johnson and two others escaped from the railroad car they were being transported in. After a month, the men were able to rejoin the Union Army at Strawberry Plains, Tennessee. Johnson was promoted to colonel and took command of the Scandinavian Regiment on July 24, 1864, remaining with the regiment until the expiration of the regiment&#x27;s service in February 1865.

==Post Civil War==
After the war Johnson went into business and settled in Beloit, Rock County, Wisconsin, becoming active in the Republican Party. He became a partner in an agricultural instrument manufacturer in Beloit, called John Thompson &amp; Co., which was his primary employment from 1870 to 1880. During that time, he was elected sergeant-at-arms of the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1870, and was then appointed the first state commissioner of immigration in 1871, by governor Lucius Fairchild. He served in that office until the end of 1873. He was then elected to two consecutive terms as mayor of Beloit, in 1877 and 1878. Later, he became president of the Watertown Bank.

==Personal life and family==
Ole Johnson was one of at least four children born to Anders Johnson and his wife Aaste Bjørnsdatter. Ole&#x27;s eldest brother was John Anders Johnson, who served as a member of the Wisconsin Senate and state Assembly, and was at one time the Democratic nominee for state Treasurer.

Ole Johnson married Freia Caroline Bødtker on January 3, 1867. They had one son, Wilford Chickamauga Johnson Shipnes. In his later years, Johnson had adopted the last name &quot;Shipnes&quot;, the name of his place of birth in Norway. 

Ole Johnson died in Beloit on November 4, 1886. His death was attributed to a stomach disease that he contracted during his time in Libby Prison.

<doc id="384659" wikidata="Q5575686" url="?curid=384659" title="God's Favorite">
<text>God&#x27;s Favorite is a play by Neil Simon, loosely based on the Biblical Book of Job. It was produced on Broadway in 1974.

==Production==
Produced by Emanuel Azenberg, the play opened on Broadway at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre on December 11, 1974 and closed on March 23, 1975, after 119 performances and seven previews. Directed by Michael Bennett with Assistant Director Bob Avian, the cast featured Vincent Gardenia (Joe Benjamin), Maria Karnilova (Rose Benjamin), and Charles Nelson Reilly (Sidney Lipton). Scenic design was by William Ritman, costumes were by Joseph G. Aulisi and lighting was by Tharon Musser.

==Plot overview==
The setting of the play is a Long Island mansion. The household consists of a pious, God-fearing tycoon named Joe Benjamin and his family: a long-suffering wife, Rose, a prodigal son, David, a pair of unique and quirky twins, Ben and Sarah, and the maid and butler, Mady and Morris. One night a messenger from God, Sidney Lipton (with a big G on his sweatshirt) arrives, and, as in the biblical story, goes through all manner of temptations to get Joe Benjamin to renounce God. When he refuses, he is visited by all the afflictions imaginable. He stands firm and the messenger has to admit defeat.

==Reception==
Clive Barnes, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: 
... this may be Mr. Simon&#x27;s most imaginative play, it is not one of his better works. Not only is the opening slow, but also the ending is anticlimactic. If you have exploited tragedy for its humor, how do you get around a happy ending? ... More than any other Simon play, &quot;God&#x27;s Favorite&quot; depends heavily on its staging and setting. Michael Bennett&#x27;s direction lets all God break loose. ... William Ritman&#x27;s collapsing mansion is some of the most fiendish theatrical real estate we have seen in years.

Thomas S. Hischak (Professor of Performing Arts, SUNY Cortland) wrote that Simon had been writing about &quot;serious issues&quot; in his last several plays, but &quot;stumbled awkwardly&quot; with &quot;God&#x27;s Favorite&quot;. Hischak described the play as a &quot;modern version of the story of &quot;Job&quot; that moved into schtick the closer it edged to genuine grief&quot;. Hischak noted that Simon had said that the play was written &quot;as a reaction to his wife&#x27;s untimely death from cancer&quot;.

The pre-production of &quot;God&#x27;s Favorite&quot; was chronicled on a January 1975 edition of the CBS News program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

<doc id="384673" wikidata="Q1763158" url="?curid=384673" title="Zero Patience">
<text>Zero Patience is a 1993 Canadian musical film written and directed by John Greyson. The film examines and refutes the urban legend of the alleged introduction of HIV to North America by a single individual, Gaëtan Dugas. Dugas, better known as Patient Zero, was the target of blame in the popular imagination in the 1980s in large measure because of Randy Shilts&#x27;s American television film docudrama, &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; (1987), a history of the early days of the AIDS epidemic. &quot;Zero Patience&quot; tells its story against the backdrop of a romance between a time-displaced Sir Richard Francis Burton and the ghost of &quot;Zero&quot; (the character is not identified by Dugas&#x27; name).

Produced in partnership with the Canadian Film Centre, the Canada Council, Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation, &quot;Zero Patience&quot; opened to mixed reviews but went on to win a number of prestigious Canadian film awards. The film has been the subject of critical attention in the context of both film theory and queer theory, and is considered part of the informal New Queer Cinema movement.

==Plot summary==
Victorian adventurer and sexologist Sir Richard Francis Burton (John Robinson), following an &quot;unfortunate encounter&quot; with the Fountain of Youth in 1892, is 170 years old and living in Toronto, Canada. Burton, now living and working as the chief taxidermist at a museum of natural history, is searching for a centerpiece display for an exhibit in his Hall of Contagion. He comes up with the idea of featuring AIDS and the Patient Zero hypothesis. Accepting the popular belief that Zero introduced the virus to North America, Burton sets out to collect video footage from those who knew Zero to support the hypothesis. When Zero&#x27;s doctor (Brenda Kamino), mother (Charlotte Boisjoli) and former airline colleague Mary (Dianne Heatherington), who is now with ACT UP, all refuse to demonize Zero, Burton manipulates the footage to make it appear as if they do and includes doctored photographs of Zero showing signs of Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma. He presents this preliminary version to the press.

The ghost of Zero (Normand Fauteux) materializes at a local gay bathhouse. No one can see or hear him, until Zero runs into Burton while Burton is spying on Zero&#x27;s friend George. Zero realizes that Burton can see him, although Zero does not show up on Burton&#x27;s video camera. The two strike a deal; Zero agrees to help Burton with his Patient Zero exhibit if Burton finds a way to make Zero appear.

The two return to the museum where Burton makes a ridiculous attempt to seduce Zero to ensure his participation. Rejecting his advances, Zero examines some of the other exhibits (including displays on Typhoid Mary and the Tuskegee syphilis study) before finding an African green monkey, another suspected early AIDS vector. The monkey (Marla Lukofsky) angrily denounces Zero for scapegoating her just as he has been scapegoated. Zero turns to Burton and they make love.

Under pressure from his director and the exhibit&#x27;s drug manufacturer sponsor, Burton steals Zero&#x27;s medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero&#x27;s under a microscope and discover Miss HIV (Michael Callen), who points out that the original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove any such thing, but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted, leading to the development of safer sex practices. Under this interpretation, Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this, an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope, drenching Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit, then storms out.

Burton fails to complete the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton&#x27;s protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains that he tried to stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.

A major subplot involves George (Richardo Keens-Douglas), a French teacher and former intimate of Zero&#x27;s. George is losing his sight to cytomegalovirus and is taking a drug that is manufactured by a company that, as a member of ACT UP, George is protesting. George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this, his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final days of his illness and his fear that the same thing will happen to him.

==Production==
John Greyson became interested in offering a counterpoint to the Patient Zero story as early as 1987, when the Patient Zero meme began entering the public consciousness following the publication of Randy Shilts&#x27;s book &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;. The book described the cluster study which led to the popular identification of flight attendant Gaëtan Dugas as the vector through which HIV was first brought to North America. Shilts himself never claimed that Dugas was the first. In early 1991 Greyson was given a development grant for the script from the Canadian Film Centre, of which Greyson is an alumnus. Over the next year Greyson, in collaboration with Film Centre partners Louise Garfield and Anna Stratton, continued to develop the script, eventually presenting it with producer Alexandra Raffé in a workshop format. During the first half of 1992, the production team secured additional development funding from the Canada Council, Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation. By June of that year the script and the songs were completed and that autumn, with funds from the Telefilm Canada and OFDC grants along with revenue from the sale of British broadcast rights to Channel 4, pre-production and casting got underway. Principal photography began in November 1992 and wrapped after five weeks. Sneak previews took place at the Seattle International Film Festival and a number of LGBT film festivals across the United States before its official debut in September 1993 at Toronto&#x27;s Festival of Festivals.

In dedicating the film&#x27;s soundtrack album to performer and AIDS activist Michael Callen and other friends they had lost to the disease, Greyson, composer Glenn Schellenberg and producers Garfield and Stratton explained their reasons for making the film. &quot;We wanted to explode the opportunistic myth of Patient Zero...More importantly, we wanted to celebrate the courage and sass of an international AIDS activist movement that has tirelessly fought for the rights of people living with AIDS.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Zero Patience&quot; garnered mixed critical reaction. The &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; cited a &quot;murky plot, frequently weak acting and often mediocre music&quot; while still praising the film&#x27;s &quot;spunk, humor, enthusiasm and wit.&quot; The &quot;Washington Post&quot; compared &quot;Zero Patience&quot; unfavorably to Hollywood&#x27;s big-budget, big-star AIDS-themed film, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, claiming that the latter&#x27;s protagonist Andrew Beckett &quot;looked sick, dealt with his illness and allowed the audience to sympathize,&quot; unlike the &quot;healthy hoofers&quot; of the musical who, because they didn&#x27;t look sick enough, &quot;[seem] to deny some of the grim realities&quot; of the disease. In a contrary favorable opinion, London&#x27;s &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; praised the film for &quot;slyly inverting popular wisdom&quot; to &quot;offer a sassy commentary on the epidemic of blame&quot; and calling &quot;Zero Patience&quot; &quot;a film which engages your mind as much as your heart, and leaves you laughing.&quot; Similarly, &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded the film&#x27;s &quot;loopy buoyancy,&quot; praising the songs as a &quot;bouncy stylistic hybrid of Gilbert and Sullivan, Ringo Starr, The Kinks and the Pet Shop Boys.&quot;

&quot;Zero Patience&quot; was honored as the Best Canadian Film and Best Ontario Feature at the 1993 Cinéfest and was awarded a Special Jury Citation as Best Canadian Feature Film at the 1993 Festival of Festivals. Greyson dedicated his award to the memory of Jay Scott, the influential film critic who had died of AIDS a few months earlier. Director Greyson and composer Glenn Schellenberg were nominated for a 1993 Genie Award for Best Original Song for the film&#x27;s theme song &quot;Zero Patience&quot;.

===Queer theory===
In examining the film from a queer theory perspective, author Michele Aaron cites &quot;Zero Patience&quot; as definitional of one of the New Queer Cinema&#x27;s central attitudes, the &quot;def[iance] of cinematic convention in terms of form, content and genre.&quot; Aaron goes on to cite the film&#x27;s musical format as &quot;further subvert[ing] the ways we might expect to be &#x27;entertained&#x27; by such serious matters as AIDS, media representation, and the legacy of moralism and sexuality.&quot; Feminist academic and AIDS video producer Alexandra Juhasz puts forth the film as &quot;an effective critique of the silly sensationalism used in much reportage of AIDS science [that] fights melodrama and tabloid journalism—with melodrama and tabloid journalism.&quot; Not all such critical commentary has been positive, with openly gay film scholar Robin Wood (who saw the film when someone very close to him was in the final stages of AIDS) calling the film &quot;misguided on the levels both of conception and execution&quot;.

<doc id="384676" wikidata="Q1872409" url="?curid=384676" title="Love Canal">
<text>Love Canal is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York, United States, infamous as the location of a landfill that became the site of an environmental disaster discovered in 1977. Decades of dumping toxic chemicals killed residents and harmed the health of hundreds, often profoundly. The area was cleaned up over 21 years in a Superfund operation.

In 1890, Love Canal was created as a model planned community, but was only partially developed. In 1894, work was begun on a canal that would have linked lakes Erie and Ontario, but it was abandoned after only was dug. In the 1920s, the canal became a dump site for municipal refuse for the city of Niagara Falls. During the 1940s, the canal was purchased by Hooker Chemical Company, which used the site to dump of chemical byproducts from the manufacturing of dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins.

Love Canal was sold to the local school district in 1953 for $1, after the threat of eminent domain. Over the next three decades, it attracted national attention for the public health problems originating from the former dumping of toxic waste on the grounds. This event displaced numerous families, leaving them with longstanding health issues and symptoms of high white blood cell counts and leukemia. Subsequently, the federal government passed the Superfund law. The resulting Superfund cleanup operation demolished the neighborhood, ending in 2004.

In 1988, New York State Department of Health Commissioner David Axelrod called the Love Canal incident a &quot;national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations&quot;. The Love Canal incident was especially significant as a situation where the inhabitants &quot;overflowed into the wastes instead of the other way around&quot;. The University at Buffalo Archives house a number of primary documents, photographs, and news clippings pertaining to the Love Canal environmental disaster; many items have been digitized and are viewable online.

== Geography ==
Love Canal is a neighborhood located in the city of Niagara Falls in the northwestern region of New York state. The neighborhood covers 36 blocks in the far southeastern corner of the city, stretching from 93rd Street comprising the western border to 100th Street in the east border and 103rd Street in the northeast. Bergholtz Creek defines the northern border with the Niagara River marking the southern border away. The LaSalle Expressway splits an uninhabited portion of the south from the north. The canal covers of land in the central eastern portion.

==Early history, canal dig, 1894–1940==
In 1890, William T. Love, a former railroad lawyer, prepared plans to construct a preplanned urban community of parks and residences on the shore of Lake Ontario. Love, who would become notorious for similar real-estate schemes later in life, claimed it would serve the area&#x27;s burgeoning industries with much-needed hydroelectricity. He named the project Model City, New York.

After 1892, Love&#x27;s plan incorporated a shipping lane that would bypass Niagara Falls, and facilitate transportation between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. He arranged backing from financial banks in New York City, Chicago, and England. During October 1893, the first factory opened for business. In May 1894, work on the canal began. Steel companies and other manufacturers expressed interest in opening plants along Love Canal. Love began having a canal dug and built a few streets and houses.

The Panic of 1893 caused investors to end sponsorship of the project. Then in 1906, environmental groups successfully lobbied Congress to pass a law, designed to preserve Niagara Falls, prohibiting the removal of water from the Niagara River. Only of the canal was dug, about wide and deep, stretching northward from the Niagara River.

The Panic of 1907 combined with the development of the transmission of electrical power over great distances, creating access to hydroelectric power far from water sources, proved disastrous for what remained of the Model City plan. The last piece of property owned by Love&#x27;s corporation was lost to foreclosure and sold at public auction in 1910. By that point, Love himself was long gone; in 1897 he left the United States for England, before returning to attempt similar schemes in Washington, Illinois, and Delaware.

With the project abandoned, the canal gradually filled with water. Local children swam there during summers and skated during the winters. In the 1920s, the city of Niagara Falls used the canal as a municipal landfill.

Industry and tourism increased steadily throughout the first half of the 20th century due to a great demand for industrial products and the increased mobility of people to travel. Paper, rubber, plastics, petrochemicals, carbon insulators, and abrasives comprised the city&#x27;s major industries.

At the time of the dump&#x27;s closure in 1952, Niagara Falls was experiencing prosperity, and the population had been expanding dramatically, growing by 31% in twenty years (1940–1960) from 78,020 to 102,394.

== Hooker Chemical Company, 1940s–1952 ==
By the end of the 1940s, Hooker Chemical Company was searching for a place to dispose its large quantity of chemical waste. The Niagara Power and Development Company granted permission to Hooker during 1942 to dump wastes into the canal. The canal was drained and lined with thick clay. Into this site, Hooker began placing drums. In 1947, Hooker bought the canal and the banks on either side of the canal. It subsequently converted it into a landfill.

In 1948, the City of Niagara Falls ended self-sufficient disposal of refuse and Hooker Chemical became the sole user and owner of the site.

In early 1952, when it became apparent that the site would likely be developed for construction, Hooker ceased use of Love Canal as a dumpsite. During its 10-year lifespan, the landfill served as the dumping site of of chemicals, mostly composed of products such as &quot;caustics, alkalines, fatty acid and chlorinated hydrocarbons resulting from the manufacturing of dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins&quot;. These chemicals were buried at a depth of . Upon its closure, the canal was covered with a clay seal to prevent leakage. Over time, vegetation settled and began to grow atop the dump site.

By the 1950s, the city of Niagara Falls was experiencing a population increase. With a growing population, the Niagara Falls City School District needed land to build new schools and attempted to purchase the property from Hooker Chemical. The population reached more than 98,000 by the 1950 census.

== Sale of the site, 1952 ==
During March 1951, the school board prepared a plan showing a school being built over the canal and listing condemnation values for each property that would need to be acquired. During March 1952, the superintendent of Niagara Falls School Board inquired of Hooker with regard to purchasing the Love Canal property for the purpose of constructing a new school. After this, in an internal company memorandum dated March 27, 1952, Bjarne Klaussen, Hooker&#x27;s vice president, wrote to the works manager that &quot;it may be advisable to discontinue using the Love Canal property for a dumping ground.&quot; During April 1952, after discussing the sale of the land with Ansley Wilcox II, Hooker&#x27;s in-house legal counsel, Klaussen then wrote to the company president, R.L. Murray, suggesting that the sale could alleviate them from future liabilities for the buried chemicals:

While the school board condemned some nearby properties, Hooker agreed to sell its property to the school board for $1. Hooker&#x27;s letter to the board agreeing to enter into negotiations noted that &quot;in view of the nature of the property and the purposes for which it has been used, it will be necessary for us to have special provisions incorporated into the deed with respect to the use of the property and other pertinent matters.&quot; The board rejected the company&#x27;s proposal that the deed require the land to be used for park purposes only, with the school itself to be built nearby.

As &quot;a means of avoiding liability by relinquishing control of the site&quot;, Hooker deeded the site to the school board in 1953 for $1 with a liability limitation clause. The sale document signed on April 28, 1953, included a seventeen-line caveat purporting to release the company from all legal obligations should lawsuits occur in the future.

Critics of Hooker&#x27;s actions believe that, in the words of Craig E. Colton and Peter N. Skinner, &quot;Hooker assigned the board with a continuing duty to protect property buyers from chemicals when the company itself accepted no such &#x27;moral obligation&#x27;.&quot; The transfer effectively ended what provision of security and maintenance for the hazardous waste had existed before and placed all responsibility in clearly unqualified hands. It was this attempt to evade their responsibility, Colten and Skinner contend, that would &quot;ultimately come back to haunt not only Hooker but all other chemical producers in the United States through the strict liability provisions of Superfund legislation.&quot; However, Eric Zuesse writes that Hooker&#x27;s decision to sell the property rather than allowing the school board to condemn it stemmed from a desire to document its warnings. &quot;Had the land been condemned and seized,&quot; says Hooker, &quot;the company would have been unable to air its concerns to all future owners of the property. It is difficult to see any other reason for what it did.&quot;

Not long after having taken control of the land, the Niagara Falls School Board proceeded to develop the land, including construction activity that substantially breached containment structures in a number of ways, allowing previously trapped chemicals to seep out.

The resulting breaches combined with particularly heavy rainstorms released and spread the chemical waste, resulting in a public health emergency and an urban planning scandal. In what became a test case for liability clauses, Hooker Chemical was found to be &quot;negligent&quot; in their disposal of waste, though not reckless in the sale of the land. The dumpsite was discovered and investigated by the local newspaper, the &quot;Niagara Falls Gazette&quot;, from 1976 through the evacuation in 1978.

== Construction of the 93rd Street School and the 99th Street School, 1952–1955 ==

Despite the disclaimer, the School Board began construction of the 99th Street School in its originally intended location. In January 1954, the school&#x27;s architect wrote to the education committee informing them that during excavation, workers discovered two dump sites filled with drums containing chemical wastes. The architect also noted it would be &quot;poor policy&quot; to build in that area since it was not known what wastes were present in the ground, and the concrete foundation might be damaged. The school board then relocated the school site further north. The kindergarten playground also had to be relocated because it was directly on top of a chemical dump.

Upon completion in 1955, 400 children attended the school, and it opened along with several other schools that had been built to accommodate students. That same year, a area crumbled exposing toxic chemical drums, which then filled with water during rainstorms. This created large puddles that children enjoyed playing in. In 1955, a second school, the 93rd Street School, was opened six blocks away.

== Home construction, 1950s ==
The school district sold the remaining land sometime in late 1957 or early 1958, resulting in homes being constructed by private developers, as well as the Niagara Falls Housing Authority. The sale came despite the warning of a Hooker attorney, Arthur Chambers, that, as paraphrased in the minutes of a board meeting, due to chemical waste having been dumped in that area, the land was not suitable for construction where underground facilities would be necessary. He stated that his company could not prevent the Board from selling the land or from doing anything they wanted to with it, but it was their intent that this property be used for a school and for parking. He further stated that Hooker felt the property should not be divided for the purpose of building homes and hoped that no one will be injured.

During 1957, the City of Niagara Falls constructed sewers for a mixture of low-income and single family residences to be built on lands adjacent to the landfill site. While building the gravel sewer beds, construction crews broke through the clay seal, breaching the canal walls. Specifically, the local government removed part of the protective clay cap to use as fill dirt for the nearby 93rd Street School, and punched holes in the solid clay walls to build water lines and the LaSalle Expressway. This allowed the toxic wastes to escape when rainwater, no longer kept out by the partially removed clay cap, washed them through the gaps in the walls. Hence, the buried chemicals could migrate and seep from the canal.

The land where the homes were being built was not part of the agreement between the school board and Hooker; thus, none of these residents knew the canal&#x27;s history. There was no monitoring or evaluating of the chemical wastes stored under the ground. Additionally, the clay cover of the canal, which was supposed to be impermeable, began to crack. The subsequent construction of the LaSalle Expressway restricted groundwater from flowing to the Niagara River. After the exceptionally wet winter and spring of 1962, the elevated expressway turned the breached canal into an overflowing pool. People reported having puddles of oil or colored liquid in yards or basements.

By the 1970s, the Love Canal area was an established suburb that appealed to commuters and families. It was proximate to the school and newly constructed churches, it was conveniently located just a few miles from the city center, and the expressway provided access to shopping and leisure opportunities. Census data revealed the area had a higher than median income, and the majority of its households included young children. Due to the great percentage of new construction in the area, less than 3% of housing units were unoccupied. In 1976, a report evaluating Niagara Falls ranked Love Canal the fourth-best area in &quot;social well-being.&quot; In total, 800 private houses and 240 low-income apartments were constructed. Before the public revelation of the environmental crisis, developers were planning to expand the area with additional homes. There were 410 children in the school during 1978.

== Lead-up and discovery, 1970s ==
Residents were suspicious of black fluid that flowed out of the Love Canal. For years, residents had complained about odors and substances in their yards or the public playgrounds. Finally, the city acted and hired a consultant, Calspan Corporation, to do a far-reaching study. In 1977, a harsh winter storm dumped of snow, significantly raising the water table. The excess water got into the ground water and raised the elevation of contaminants including dioxin. During the spring of 1977, the State Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation began an intensive air, soil, and groundwater sampling and analysis program after qualitative identification of a number of organic compounds in the basements of 11 homes adjacent to the Love Canal. It was also revealed that the standards at the time did not require the installation of a liner to prevent leaching; this became very common among companies.

=== Contaminants ===
Numerous contaminants dumped in the landfill included chlorinated hydrocarbon residues, processed sludge, fly ash, and other materials, including residential municipal garbage.

Data showed unacceptable levels of toxic vapors associated with more than 80 compounds were emanating from the basements of numerous homes in the first ring directly adjacent to the Love Canal. Ten of the most prevalent and most toxic compounds – including benzene, a known human carcinogen – were selected for evaluation purposes and as indicators of the presence of other chemical constituents.

Laboratory analyses of soil and sediment samples from the Love Canal indicate the presence of more than 200 distinct organic chemical compounds; approximately 100 of these have been identified to date.

Numerous other chemicals seeped through the ground. Some of the chemicals and toxic materials found included benzene, chloroform, toluene, dioxin, and various kinds of PCB.

== Health effects ==
At first, scientific studies did not conclusively prove the chemicals were responsible for the residents&#x27; illnesses, and scientists were divided on the issue, even though eleven known or suspected carcinogens had been identified, one of the most prevalent being benzene. Also present was dioxin (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins) in the water, a very hazardous substance. Dioxin pollution is usually measured in parts per trillion; at Love Canal, water samples showed dioxin levels of 53 parts per billion (53,000 parts per trillion). Geologists were recruited to determine whether underground swales were responsible for carrying the chemicals to the surrounding residential areas. Once there, chemicals could leach into basements and evaporate into household air.

In 1979, the EPA announced the result of blood tests that showed high white blood cell counts, a precursor to leukemia, and chromosome damage in Love Canal residents. 33% of the residents had undergone chromosomal damage. In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people. Other studies were unable to find harm. In 1991 United States National Research Council (NRC) surveyed Love Canal health studies. The NRC noted the major exposure of concern was the groundwater rather than drinking water; the groundwater &quot;seeped into basements&quot; and then resulted in exposure through air and soil. Several studies reported higher levels of low-birth weight babies and birth defects among the exposed residents with some evidence the effect subsided after the exposure was eliminated. The National Research Council also noted a study that found exposed children were found to have an &quot;excess of seizures, learning problems, hyperactivity, eye irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, and incontinence&quot; and stunted growth. Voles in the area were found to have significantly increased mortality compared to controls (mean life expectancy in exposed animals &quot;23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively, compared to 48.8 days&quot; for control animals). New York State also has an ongoing health study of Love Canal residents. In that year, the Albert Elia Building Co., Inc., now Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., was selected as the principal contractor to safely re-bury the toxic waste at the Love Canal Site.

According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 1979 residents exhibited a &quot;disturbingly high rate of miscarriages ... Love Canal can now be added to a growing list of environmental disasters involving toxics, ranging from industrial workers stricken by nervous disorders and cancers to the discovery of toxic materials in the milk of nursing mothers.&quot; In one case, two out of four children in a single Love Canal family had birth defects; one girl was born deaf with a cleft palate, an extra row of teeth, and slight intellectual disability, and a boy was born with an eye defect.

== Awareness ==

In 1976, two reporters for the &quot;Niagara Falls Gazette&quot;, David Pollak and David Russell, tested several sump pumps near Love Canal and found toxic chemicals in them. The &quot;Gazette&quot; published reports, once in October 1976 and once in November 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal dumpsite indicating the presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons.

The matter became quiet for more than a year and was then revived by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by performing an informal door-to-door survey during early 1978, writing a hundred news items on toxic wastes in the area and finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group, which was organized by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a dozen) birth defects. The New York State Health Department investigated and found an abnormal incidence of miscarriages. Brown discovered the size of the canal, the presence of dioxin, the expanding contamination, and the involvement, to an extent, of the U.S. Army. Hooker threatened to sue him and he fought the firm for years, including on the &quot;Today Show&quot;. His book on toxic wastes, &quot;Laying Waste: The Poisoning of America By Toxic Chemicals&quot;, was the first written on the subject of toxic wastes and created a national firestorm, as did articles of his in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. He also discovered a huge dump called the Hyde Park landfill (or Bloody Run) and the &quot;S-Area,&quot; which was leaking into the water supply for Niagara Falls. His work inspired many activists. He spoke for ten years on the college lecture circuit.

In September 1977, Congressman John LaFalce (D), who represented the district, paid a high profile visit to Love Canal, to raise attention to the serious problems. LaFalce intervened to get city, state and federal officials, and Hooker executives, involved to take quick action, but he was met with resistance, apathy and stalling.

By 1978, Love Canal had become a national media event with articles referring to the neighborhood as &quot;a public health time bomb&quot;, and &quot;one of the most appalling environmental tragedies in American history&quot;. Brown, working for the local newspaper, the &quot;Niagara Gazette&quot;, is credited with not only revealing the case, but establishing toxic chemical wastes as a nationwide issue as well. Brown&#x27;s book, &quot;Laying Waste&quot;, examined the Love Canal disaster and many other toxic waste catastrophes nationwide.

The dumpsite was declared an unprecedented state of emergency on August 2, 1978. Brown, who wrote more than a hundred articles concerning the dump, tested the groundwater and later found the dump was three times larger than originally thought, with possible ramifications beyond the original evacuation zone. He also discovered that toxic dioxins were there.

== Activism tactics ==
Activism at Love Canal was initially organized by community residents Tom Heiser and Lois Gibbs, with Lois Gibbs often serving as spokesperson. Gibbs&#x27;s strategies emphasized concerns for children and families of the affected area, with women taking the most prominent public and active roles. Many men also helped women in these efforts, though not always publicly. Men who were hesitant to oppose Hooker Chemical openly for example, were able to contribute to the movement through increased contributions to family labor in the absence of their activist wives.

In addition to community organizing and pressuring authorities for appropriate responses, direct-action forms of activism were employed. Tactics included protests and rallies, which were intentionally timed and planned in an effort to maximize media attention. Such events included &quot;controversial&quot; methods such as mothers protesting while pushing strollers, marching by pregnant women, and children holding protest signs. Notably, two EPA employees were also held hostage by activists for approximately five hours at the office of the Love Canal Homeowners Association (LCHA) , to bring their demands to the attention of the federal government.

=== Role of community organizations ===

Numerous organizations were formed in response to the crisis at Love Canal, with members&#x27; activism emphasizing variously overlapping interests. In addition to the Love Canal Homeowners Association (LCHA), other major organizations involved included the Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). These organizations are often overlooked in the story of Love Canal, according to research by Elizabeth Blum in &quot;Love Canal Revisited&quot;.

The Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF) was a religious organization composed of volunteers from the surrounding area. In conjunction with other citizens&#x27; groups such as LCHA and LCARA, the ETF used their resources to promote environmental health and gender, class, and racial equality.

The NAACP became involved with the Love Canal issue after William Abrams Sr., president of the Niagara Falls chapter drew attention to his wife&#x27;s fatal liver failure. Abrams&#x27;s involvement drew attention to racial inequality present in the community and concerns about how this could affect comprehensive relocation efforts. Abrams contacted the regional NAACP director who announced that discrimination against minorities at Love Canal would be met with legal action. This involvement inspired additional support and activism, particularly on behalf of members of the renting community, many of whom were also members of the African-American and immigrant communities at the site.

Another subgroup of local residents formed the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). This group&#x27;s action sought to address the needs of the (largely, but not exclusively, African-American) renter community, whose interests were at times perceived to be in conflict with those of some members of the (predominantly white) property owners represented by the LCHA.

In 1980, Lois Gibbs established the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice as a continuation of her activism at Love Canal.

=== Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners&#x27; Association ===
On August 2, 1978, Lois Gibbs, a local mother who called an election to head the Love Canal Homeowners&#x27; Association, began to rally homeowners. Her son, Michael Gibbs, began attending school in September 1977. He developed epilepsy in December, suffered from asthma and a urinary tract infection, and had a low white blood cell count, all associated with his exposure to the leaking chemical waste. Gibbs had learned from Brown that her neighborhood sat atop the buried chemical waste.

During the following years, Gibbs organized an effort to investigate community concerns about the health of its residents. She and other residents made repeated complaints of strange odors and &quot;substances&quot; that surfaced in their yards. In Gibbs&#x27; neighborhood, there was a high rate of unexplained illnesses, miscarriages, and intellectual disability. Basements were often covered with a thick, black substance, and vegetation was dying. In many yards, the only vegetation that grew were shrubby grasses. Although city officials were asked to investigate the area, they did not act to solve the problem. Niagara Falls mayor Michael O&#x27;Laughlin infamously stated that there was &quot;nothing wrong&quot; in Love Canal.

With further investigation, Gibbs discovered the chemical danger of the adjacent canal. This began her organization&#x27;s two-year effort to demonstrate that the waste buried by Hooker Chemical was responsible for the health problems of local residents. Throughout the ordeal, homeowners&#x27; concerns were ignored not only by Hooker Chemical (now a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum), but also by members of government. These parties argued that the area&#x27;s endemic health problems were unrelated to the toxic chemicals buried in the Canal. Since the residents could not prove the chemicals on their property had come from Hooker&#x27;s disposal site, they could not prove liability. Throughout the legal battle, residents were unable to sell their properties and relocate.

== Federal response, 1978–2004 ==
On August 7, 1978, United States President Jimmy Carter announced a federal health emergency, called for the allocation of federal funds, and ordered the Federal Disaster Assistance Agency to assist the City of Niagara Falls to remedy the Love Canal site. This was the first time in American history that emergency funds were used for a situation other than a natural disaster. Carter had trenches built that would transport the wastes to sewers and had home sump pumps sealed off.

Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), better known as the Superfund Act. Love Canal became the first entry on the list. CERCLA created a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries and provided broad Federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the environment. CERCLA also created a National Priorities List, a shortened list of the sites that has priority in cleanup. Love Canal was the first Superfund site on that list. Eventually, the site was cleaned and deleted off the list in 2004. Because the Superfund Act contained a &quot;retroactive liability&quot; provision, Occidental was held liable for cleanup of the waste even though it had followed all applicable U.S. laws when disposing of it.

== Aftermath ==

When Eckhardt C. Beck (EPA Administrator for Region 2, 1977–1979) visited Love Canal during the late 1970s, he discerned the presence of toxic substances in the community:

Robert Whalen, then-New York&#x27;s Health Commissioner, also visited Love Canal and believed that the Canal constituted an emergency, stating: &quot;Love Canal Chemical Waste Landfill constitutes a public nuisance and an extremely serious threat and danger to the health, safety and welfare of those using it, living near it or exposed to the conditions emanating from it, consisting among other things, of chemical wastes lying exposed on the surface in numerous places pervasive, pernicious and obnoxious chemical vapors and fumes affecting both the ambient air and the homes of certain residents living near such sites.&quot; Whalen also instructed people to avoid going into their basements as well as to avoid fruits and vegetables grown in their gardens. People became very worried because many had consumed produce from their gardens for several years. Whalen urged that all pregnant women and children under the age of two be removed from Love Canal as soon as possible.

The 99th Street School, on the other hand, was located within the former boundary of the Hooker Chemical landfill site. It was closed some two years later and subsequently demolished because of concerns about seeping toxic waste, but both the school board and the chemical company denied responsibility for the pollution, and thus the liability for its cleanup and the damages arising from past failures to remediate the site.

=== Evacuation ===
The lack of public interest in Love Canal made matters worse for the homeowners&#x27; association, which was opposed by two organizations seeking to disprove negligence in the disposal of the waste. Initially, members of the association had been frustrated by the lack of a public entity that could advise and defend them. Gibbs met with public resistance from a number of residents within the community. Eventually, the federal government relocated more than 800 families and reimbursed them for the loss of their homes. The state government and federal government used $15 million to purchase 400 homes closest to Love Canal and demolished several rings of houses.

=== Litigation and compensation ===
In 1994, Federal District Judge John Curtin ruled that Hooker/Occidental had been negligent, but not reckless, in its handling of the waste and sale of the land to the Niagara Falls School Board. Curtin&#x27;s decision also contains a detailed history of events leading up to the Love Canal disaster. Occidental Petroleum was sued by the EPA and in 1995 agreed to pay $129 million in restitution. Out of that federal lawsuit came money for a small health fund and $3.5 million for the state health study. Residents&#x27; lawsuits were also settled in the years following the Love Canal disaster.

The Department of Justice published a report noting that the sites have been successfully remediated and are ready again for use. The Love Canal Area Revitalization Authority sold a few abandoned homes to private citizens. Virtually all remedial activities of the site, other than the operation of the leachate collection system, were completed by 1989.

=== Remediation ===
Houses in the residential areas on the east and west sides of the canal were demolished. All that remains on the west side are abandoned residential streets. Some older east side residents, whose houses stand alone in the demolished neighborhood, chose to stay. It was estimated that fewer than 90 of the original 900 families opted to remain. They were willing to remain as long as they were guaranteed that their homes were in a relatively safe area. On June 4, 1980, the state government founded the Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency (LCARA) to restore the area. The area north of Love Canal became known as Black Creek Village. LCARA wanted to resell 300 homes that had been bought by New York when the residents were relocated. The homes are farther away from where the chemicals were dumped. The most toxic area () was reburied with a thick plastic liner, clay and dirt. A high barbed wire fence was installed around the area. It has been calculated that 248 separate chemicals, including of dioxin, have been unearthed from the canal.

=== Analysis ===
In 1998, Elizabeth Whelan, founder of industry advocacy group American Council on Science and Health, wrote an editorial about the Canal in which she stated that the media started calling the Canal a &quot;public health time bomb&quot;, an editorial that created minor hysteria. She declared that people were not falling ill because of exposure to chemical waste, but from stress caused by the media. Besides double the rate of birth defects to children born while living on Love Canal, a follow-up study two decades after the incident &quot;showed increased risks of low birth weight, congenital malformations and other adverse reproductive events&quot;.

Love Canal, along with Times Beach, Missouri and the Valley of the Drums, Kentucky, are important in United States environmental history as three sites that significantly contributed to the passing of the CERCLA. Love Canal has &quot;become the symbol for what happens when hazardous industrial products are not confined to the workplace but &#x27;hit people where they live&#x27; in inestimable amounts&quot;.

Love Canal was not an isolated case. Eckardt C. Beck suggested that there are probably hundreds of similar dumpsites. President Carter declared that discovering these dumpsites was &quot;one of the grimmest discoveries of the modern era&quot;. Had the residents of Love Canal been aware that they were residing on toxic chemicals, most would not have moved there in the first place. Beck noted that one main problem remains that ownership of such chemical companies can change over the years, making liability difficult to assign (a problem that would be addressed by CERCLA, or the Superfund Act). Beck contended that increased commitment was necessary to develop controls that would &quot;defuse future Love Canals&quot;.

Some free market environmentalist activists have cited the Love Canal incident as a consequence of government decision-makers not taking responsibility for their decisions. Economics professor Richard Stroup writes, &quot;The school district owning the land had a laudable but narrow goal: it wanted to provide education cheaply for district children. Government decision makers are seldom held accountable for broader social goals in the way that private owners are by liability rules and potential profits.&quot;

===Conclusion===
In 2004, federal officials announced that the Superfund cleanup has ended, although cleanup had concluded years prior. The entire process occurred over 21 years and cost a total of $400 million. About 260 homes north of the canal have been renovated and sold to new owners, and about east of the canal have been sold to commercial developers for light industrial uses. In total, 950 families had been evacuated. The site was removed from the Superfund list on September 30, 2004.

=== Epilogue ===
After Love Canal families were relocated, the canal was buried under a plastic liner, clay and topsoil in a fenced area that was declared to be permanently off-limits, while scores of the abandoned homes were buried. The rest of the Love Canal area was declared safe by the EPA and a public corporation (Love Canal Revitalization Agency) took ownership of the abandoned properties, which were fixed up and sold.

Beginning in 1990, there were 260 homes that were given new vinyl siding, roofs and windows, then resold at prices that were 20% below market value and renamed &quot;Black Creek Village.&quot; By 1998, the Love Canal Revitalization Agency had sold 232 of 239 renovated homes. New residents of the area were initially undeterred and felt safe due to extensive testing of the area. They were enticed to move into the area due to the promise of &quot;cleaned-up land and affordable homes.&quot; For example, Dan and Teresa Reynolds had bought a 4-bedroom home in the neighborhood for less than $40,000 in the early 2000s. They were told the waste was contained and the area was safe.

Former residents who had evacuated Love Canal were alarmed when new residents began to move in. Luella Kenny&#x27;s 7-year-old son had died of kidney disease, and a new family later moved into the same home her family had abandoned. Kenny noted her son&#x27;s autopsy had revealed the &quot;same symptoms they see in animals that have been exposed to dioxin.&quot; She commented about the new residents, &quot;The children are what bother me when I see them running around this neighborhood. I&#x27;m so frightened for them.&quot;

In 2013, when Lois Gibbs returned to visit the area, she was shocked that the containment site no longer had &quot;danger&quot; signs and the signs merely indicated &quot;private property.&quot; She noted that someone house hunting in the area would not be put on alert that there were toxins in the area. Gibbs observed, &quot;It&#x27;s like a gated community for chemicals.&quot;

By 2013, residents of Black Creek Village complained of mysterious rashes, cysts and other ailments, as well as miscarriages. Initially, six families initiated lawsuits with notice that an addition 1100 claims might be coming. The lawsuits did not specify damages sought, but alleged that Love Canal was never properly remediated and dangerous toxins continued to leach onto residents&#x27; properties.

Hooker Chemical Company had dumped the chemicals in the 1940s and 1950s, but the company was bought in 1968 by Occidental Petroleum Corporation. In 1994, to settle a key civil lawsuit, Occidental agreed to pay the state of New York $25 million over 30 years. At one time, Occidental&#x27;s liability in the case was estimated to be as much as $700 million, but U.S. District Judge John T. Curtin rejected the state&#x27;s request for punitive damages, which might have totaled $270 million. After the settlement, in 1995, Occidental was tasked by the state of New York with monitoring the Love Canal site. Occidental shifted responsibility for maintaining the site to its subsidiary, Glenn Springs Holdings. The 2013 litigation largely sought to hold Occidental responsible. However, the corporation maintained that the waste was contained and state and federal agencies supported their position.

In 2024, a state court in New York dismissed 18 class-action lawsuits against OxyChem, another subsidiary of Occidental, because the court found the plaintiffs&#x27; claims were &quot;speculative.&quot; The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.

== Controversies related to Wheatfield landfill ==
As remediation of the Love Canal site was attempted beginning in the 1970s, contamination was moved elsewhere. Waste equal in volume to 80 dump trucks was exhumed and shipped to out-of-state incinerators. However, some of the waste also ended up less than 10 miles away to a landfill owned by the Town of Wheatfield, which is located on the border of Wheatfield and North Tonawanda. The landfill had been operated by the Niagara Sanitation Company from 1964 to 1968 for municipal and industrial waste from plants including Carborundum, Bell Aerospace and Frontier Chemical. Residents near the landfill frequently complained of odors, exposed waste, discolored water and generally unsafe conditions, especially for children. In 1965, residents wrote to the city and asked the area be fenced.

In 1968, during the construction of the LaSalle Expressway in Niagara Falls, Love Canal waste was dug up, which ended up in the Wheatfield landfill. In 1982, a local newspaper report initially brought to light that Love Canal waste had ended up in the Wheatfield landfill. The Wheatfield municipal authorities ignored residents&#x27; concerns as hysteria, but in subsequent years many residents developed cancers, lupus, as well as other mysterious ailments that confounded doctors. In 2012, the state Department of Environmental Conservation reversed its long-term position that remediation of the landfill was unnecessary. In 2014, the DEC got Glenn Springs Holdings (the subsidiary of Occidental that was responsible for maintaining the Love Canal site) to pay for the removal of the Love Canal waste from the Wheatfield landfill. In December 2015, the landfill was declared a Superfund site.

A 2017 lawsuit asserts that Hooker&#x27;s creation of a brine pipeline along the edge of the landfill used to move brine from Wyoming County to its Niagara Falls plant location, may have created a conduit for the landfilled waste to leak out. Ironically, some of the residents who lived near the landfill had moved there when they were evacuated from their previous homes in Love Canal.

== In popular culture ==
The legacy of the disaster inspired a fictionalized 1982 made-for-TV film titled &quot;Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal&quot;.

In 1983, the award-winning documentary by Lynn Corcoran titled &quot;In Our Own Backyard&quot; was released in the U.S..

The 1998 video game &quot;Blood II: The Chosen&quot; features a level called Love Canal, whose opening text makes explicit references to the disaster.

&quot;Modern Marvels&quot; retold the disaster in 2004.

10,000 Maniacs has a song about Love Canal on the album &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Zoo&quot; titled &quot;Poison in the Well.&quot;

Joyce Carol Oates included the story of Love Canal in her 2004 novel &quot;The Falls&quot;, but she changed the period of time when the disaster occurred from the 1970s to the 1960s.

The 1982 film &quot;Tootsie&quot; , referencing the then recent disaster, has a character (played by Bill Murray) attempting to produce a play called &quot;Return to Love Canal&quot;. In response to the pitch for the play, Sydney Pollack tells Dustin Hoffman that &quot;Nobody wants to produce a play about a couple that moved back to Love Canal. Nobody wants to pay twenty dollars to see people living next to chemical waste. They can see that in New Jersey.&quot;

In 2022, the non-fiction narrative &quot;Paradise Falls: The True Story of an Environmental Catastrophe&quot;, was published by Pantheon.

In April 2024, the documentary &quot;Poisoned Ground: The Tragedy at Love Canal&quot; was premiered on PBS.
&quot;Love Canal&quot; was a segment in the premiere episode of Michael Moore&#x27;s television series &quot;TV Nation&quot;, which featured realtors attempting to lure prospective residents to the area.

&quot;Love Canal&quot; is the name of a 7&quot; single released by the punk rock band Flipper in February 1981. The lyrics are about the disaster.

In the 2000 film &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, when legal counsel Ed Masry holds a town meeting in an attempt to discuss arbitration in the case of Hinkley groundwater contamination by Pacific Gas and Electric, the townsfolk are reluctant to agree. When they turn on the idea, Masry brings up Love Canal, as an example of a case in which going to trial would be more time-consuming and difficult, explaining that many plaintiffs still had cases which were open because they were still being settled or appealed. When the film was set, in 1993, litigation for Love Canal was still ongoing, despite the fact that it first came to the attention of the public and the government back in the late 1970s.

<text>Joan Tower (born September 6, 1938) is a Grammy-winning contemporary American composer, concert pianist and conductor. Lauded by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as &quot;one of the most successful woman composers of all time&quot;, her bold and energetic compositions have been performed in concert halls around the world. After gaining recognition for her first orchestral composition, &quot;Sequoia&quot; (1981), a tone poem which structurally depicts a giant tree from trunk to needles, she has gone on to compose a variety of instrumental works including &quot;Fanfare for the Uncommon Woman&quot;, which is something of a response to Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot;, the &quot;Island Prelude&quot;, five string quartets, and an assortment of other tone poems. Tower was pianist and founding member of the Naumburg Award-winning Da Capo Chamber Players, which commissioned and premiered many of her early works, including her widely performed &quot;Petroushskates&quot;.

==Life and career==
Born in New Rochelle, New York, in 1938, Tower moved to Bolivia when she was nine years old, an experience which she credits for making rhythm an integral part of her work. Tower discovered this love for rhythm in the local saint’s day celebrations. There, she learned how to play percussion and then started her musical journey. For the next decade Tower&#x27;s talent in music, particularly on the piano, grew rapidly due to her father&#x27;s insistence that she benefit from consistent musical training. Tower&#x27;s relationship with her mineralogist father is visible in many aspects of her work, most specifically her &quot;mineral works&quot; including &quot;Black Topaz&quot; (1976) and &quot;Silver Ladders&quot; (1986). She returned to the United States as a young woman to study music, first at Bennington College and then at Columbia University where she studied under Otto Luening, Jack Beeson, and Vladimir Ussachevsky and was awarded her doctorate in composition in 1968 .

In 1969 Tower, along with violinist Joel Lester and flautist Patricia Spencer, founded the New York-based Da Capo Chamber Players where she served as the group&#x27;s pianist. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s Tower wrote a number of successful works for the Da Capo Players, including &quot;Platinum Spirals&quot; (1976), &quot;Amazon I&quot; (1977) and &quot;Wings&quot; (1981). The group won several awards in its early years, including the Naumburg Award in 1973. Tower left the group in 1984, buoyed by the immediate success of her first orchestral composition, &quot;Sequoia&quot; (1981). Tower also was influenced by jazz music by seeing performers such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane in various clubs in New York City. This inspired her to become a jazz pianist for ten years and implement jazz chords in many of her works. 

In 1972 Tower had accepted a faculty position at Bard College in composition, a post she continues to hold today. Tower received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1976. From 1985 to 1988 Tower was composer-in-residence at the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.

Tower became the first woman recipient of the Grawemeyer Award for Music in 1990 for her composition &quot;Silver Ladders&quot;. In 1993, under commission from the Milwaukee Ballet, Tower composed &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;, and she conducted sections from it at the White House. Other compositions from the 1990s include the third &quot;Fanfare for the Uncommon Woman&quot;, several piano concertos (notably 1996&#x27;s &quot;Rapids (Piano Concerto no. 2)&quot; and &quot;Tambor&quot; (1998) written for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. In 1999 Tower accepted a position as composer-in-residence with the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s and in 1998 she won the Delaware Symphony&#x27;s Alfred I. DuPont Award for Distinguished American Composer.

In 2002 Tower won the Annual Composer&#x27;s Award from the Lancaster Symphony. During the 2003–2004 season two new works were debuted, &quot;DNA,&quot; a percussion quintet commissioned for Frank Epstein, and &quot;Incandescent&quot;. In 2004 the Nashville Symphony&#x27;s recording of &quot;Tambor&quot;, &quot;Made in America&quot;, and her Concerto for Orchestra earned a Grammy nomination. In 2004 Carnegie Hall&#x27;s &quot;Making Music&quot; series featured a retrospective of Tower&#x27;s body of work, performed by artists including the Tokyo String Quartet and pianists Melvin Chen and Ursula Oppens. In 2005 Tower became the first composer commissioned for the &quot;Ford Made in America&quot; program, the only project of its kind to involve smaller-budget orchestras as commissioning agents of new work by major composers, in which her 15-minute &quot;Made in America&quot; was performed in every state of the union during the 2005–2007 season. In 2008, Tower&#x27;s &quot;Made in America&quot; and the recording of it by the Nashville Symphony conducted by Leonard Slatkin won three Grammy Awards: in the categories Best Orchestral Performance, Best Classical Album and Best Classical Contemporary Composition. 

Alongside those listed above, her work has been performed by many of the world leading orchestras and chamber ensembles, including The Orchestra Now, the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Seraph Brass, and the renowned American Brass Quintet.

She is currently the Asher B. Edelman Professor of Music at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, and as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She also serves on the Artistic Advisory panel of the BMI Foundation.

==Work==
Tower&#x27;s early music reflects the influence of her mentors at Columbia University and is rooted in the serialist tradition, whose sparse texture complemented her interest in chamber music. As she developed as a composer Tower began to gravitate towards the work of Olivier Messiaen and George Crumb and broke away from the strict serialist model. Her work became more colorful and has often been described as impressionistic. She often composes with specific ensembles or soloists in mind, and aims to exploit the strengths of these performers in her composition. 

Among her most notable work is the six-part &quot;Fanfare for the Uncommon Woman&quot;, each dedicated to &#x27;women who are adventurous and take risks&#x27;. Inspired by Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot;, four of the six parts are scored for 3 trumpets, 4 horns, 3 trombones, tuba and percussion. The first was debuted in 1987 and conducted by Hans Vonk. For the second, which premiered in 1989, Tower added one percussion while the third, debuted in 1991 was scored for a double brass quintet. The fourth and sixth are scored for full orchestra. The fifth part was commissioned for the Aspen Music Festival in 1993 and was written specifically for Joan W. Harris. The first five parts were added to the National Recording Registry in 2014.

<text>Sofia Asgatovna Gubaidulina ( , ; born 24 October 1931) is a Soviet-Russian composer and an established international figure. Major orchestras around the world have commissioned and performed her works. She is considered one of the foremost Russian composers of the second half of the 20th century along with Alfred Schnittke and Edison Denisov.

== Early life ==
Gubaidulina was born in Chistopol, Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (now the Republic of Tatarstan), Russian SFSR, to an ethnically mixed family of a Volga Tatar father and a Russian mother. Her father, Asgat Masgudovich Gubaidulin, was an engineer and her mother, Fedosiya Fyodorovna (née Yelkhova), was a teacher. After discovering music at the age of 5, Gubaidulina immersed herself in ideas of composition. While studying at the Children&#x27;s Music School with Ruvim Poliakov, Gubaidulina discovered spiritual ideas and found them in the works of composers such as Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven. Gubaidulina quickly learned to keep her spiritual interests secret from her parents and other adults since the Soviet Union was hostile to religion. These early experiences with music and spiritual ideas led her to treat these two domains of thought as conceptually similar and explains her later striving to write music expressing and exploring spiritually based concepts.

She has been married three times.

==Career==
Gubaidulina studied composition and piano at the Kazan Conservatory, graduating in 1954. During her early conservatory years, Western contemporary music was banned almost entirely from study, an unusual exception being Bartók. Raids even took place in the dormitory halls, where searches were conducted for banned scores, Stravinsky being the most infamous and sought after. Gubaidulina and her peers procured and studied modern Western scores nonetheless. &quot;We knew Ives, Cage, we actually knew everything on the sly.&quot; In Moscow she undertook further studies at the Conservatory with Nikolay Peyko until 1959, and then with Vissarion Shebalin until 1963. She was awarded a Stalin fellowship. Her music was deemed &quot;irresponsible&quot; during her studies in Soviet Russia, due to its exploration of alternative tunings. She was supported, however, by Dmitri Shostakovich, who in evaluating her final examination encouraged her to continue on her path despite others calling it &quot;mistaken&quot;. She was allowed to express her modernism in various scores she composed for documentary films, including the 1963 production, &quot;On Submarine Scooters&quot;, a 70mm film shot in the unique Kinopanorama widescreen format. She also composed the score to the well-known Russian animated picture &quot;Adventures of Mowgli&quot; (an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Book&quot;).

In the mid-1970s Gubaidulina founded &quot;Astreja&quot;, a folk-instrument improvisation group with fellow composers Viktor Suslin and Vyacheslav Artyomov. In 1979, she was blacklisted as one of the &quot;Khrennikov&#x27;s Seven&quot; at the Sixth Congress of the Union of Soviet Composers for writing “noisy mud instead of musical innovation, unconnected with real life&quot;.

Gubaidulina became better known abroad during the early 1980s through Gidon Kremer&#x27;s championing of her violin concerto &quot;Offertorium&quot;. &quot;She sprang to international fame in the late 1980s&quot;. She later composed an homage to T. S. Eliot, using the text from the poet&#x27;s &quot;Four Quartets&quot;. In 2000, Gubaidulina, along with Tan Dun, Osvaldo Golijov, and Wolfgang Rihm, was commissioned by the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart to write a piece for the Passion 2000 project in commemoration of Johann Sebastian Bach. Her contribution was the &quot;Johannes-Passion&quot;. In 2002 she followed this with the &quot;Johannes-Ostern&quot; (&quot;Easter according to John&quot;), commissioned by Hannover Rundfunk. The two works together form a &quot;diptych&quot; on the death and resurrection of Christ, her largest work to date. Invited by Walter Fink, she was the 13th composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2003, the first female composer of the series. Her work &quot;The Light at the End&quot; preceded Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 in the 2005 proms. In 2007 her second violin concerto &quot;In Tempus Praesens&quot; was performed at the Lucerne Festival by Anne-Sophie Mutter. Its creation has been depicted in Jan Schmidt-Garre&#x27;s film &quot;Sophia – Biography of a Violin Concerto&quot;.

Since 1992, Gubaidulina has lived in Hamburg, Germany. She is a member of the musical academies in Frankfurt, Hamburg and the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.

==Aesthetic==
For Gubaidulina, music was an escape from the socio-political atmosphere of Soviet Russia. For this reason, she associated music with human transcendence and mystical spiritualism, which manifests itself as a longing inside the soul of humanity to locate its true being, a longing she continually tries to capture in her works. These abstract religious and mystical associations are realized in Gubaidulina&#x27;s compositions in various ways, such as writing in bowing directions that cause the performer to draw a crucifix in the final movement of &quot;Seven Words&quot; for cello, bayan, and strings. Gubaidulina is a devout member of the Russian Orthodox church. 

The influence of electronic music and improvisational techniques is exemplified in her unusual combination of contrasting elements, novel instrumentation, and the use of traditional Russian folk instruments in her solo and chamber works, such as &quot;De profundis&quot; for bayan, &quot;Et expecto&quot;, the sonata for bayan, and &quot;In croce&quot; for cello and organ or bayan. The koto, a traditional Japanese instrument is featured in her work &quot;In the Shadow of the Tree&quot;, in which one solo player performs on three different instruments—koto, bass koto, and zheng. The &quot;Canticle of the Sun&quot; is a cello concerto/choral hybrid, dedicated to Mstislav Rostropovich. The use of the lowest possible registers on the cello opens new possibilities for the instrument.

Further influence of improvisation techniques can be found in her fascination with percussion instruments. She associates the indeterminate nature of percussive timbres with the mystical longing and the potential freedom of human transcendence. In an interview with the modern British composer Ivan Moody, Gubaidulina provides an explanation for how percussion is utilized in her works to show spiritualism. She says,
... percussion has an acoustic cloud around it, a cloud that cannot be analyzed. These instruments are at the boundary between palpable reality and the subconscious, because they have these acoustics. Their purely physical characteristics, of the timpani and membranophones and so on, when the skin vibrates, or the wood is touched, respond. They enter into that layer of our consciousness which is not logical, they are at the boundary between the conscious and the subconscious.

She was also preoccupied by experimentation with non-traditional methods of sound production and, as already mentioned, with unusual combinations of instruments, e.g. Concerto for Bassoon and Low Strings (1975), &quot;Detto – I&quot;, sonata for organ and percussion (1978), &quot;The Garden of Joy and Sorrow&quot; for flute, harp and viola (1980), and &quot;Descensio&quot; for 3 trombones, 3 percussionists, harp, harpsichord/celesta and celesta/piano (1981).

Gubaidulina notes that the two composers to whom she experiences a constant devotion are J. S. Bach and Anton Webern, although she had periods of devotion to Wagner, the Second Viennese School, and 16th century music, most notably Gesualdo da Venosa and Josquin des Prez. Among some non-musical influences of considerable import are Carl Jung (Swiss thinker and founder of analytical psychology) and Nikolai Berdyaev (Russian religious philosopher, whose works were forbidden in the USSR, but nevertheless found and studied by the composer).

==Style==
A profoundly spiritual person, Gubaidulina defines &quot;re-ligio&quot; as re-legato (&quot;re-bound&quot;) or as restoration of the connection between oneself and the Absolute. As she explains:I am a religious Russian Orthodox person and I understand &#x27;religion&#x27; in the literal meaning of the word, as &#x27;re-ligio&#x27;, that is to say the restoration of connections, the restoration of the &#x27;legato&#x27; of life. There is no more serious task for music than this.She finds this re-connection through the artistic process and has developed a number of musical symbols to express her ideals. She does it through narrower means of intervallic and rhythmic relationship within the primary material of her works, by seeking to discover the depth and mysticism of the sound, as well as on a larger scale, through the carefully thought architecture of musical form.

Gubaidulina&#x27;s music is characterised by the use of unusual instrumental combinations. &quot;In Erwartung&quot; combines percussion (bongos, güiros, temple blocks, cymbals and tam-tams among others) and saxophone quartet.

Melodically, Gubaidulina&#x27;s is characterized by the frequent use of intense chromatic motives rather than long melodic phrases. She often treats musical space as a means of attaining unity with the divine—a direct line to God—concretely manifest by the lack of striation in pitch space. She achieves this through the use of micro-chromaticism (i.e., quarter tones) and frequent glissandi, exemplifying the lack of &quot;steps&quot; to the divine. This notion is furthered by her extreme dichotomy characterized by chromatic space vs. diatonic space viewed as symbols of darkness vs. light and human/mundane vs. divine/heavenly. Additionally, the use of short motivic segments allows her to create a musical narrative that is seemingly open-ended and disjunct rather than smooth. Finally, another important melodic technique can be seen with her use of harmonics. When talking about her piece &quot;Rejoice!&quot;, a sonata for violin and cello, Gubaidulina explains,
The possibility for string instruments to derive pitches of various heights at one and the same place on the string can be experienced in music as the transition to another plane of existence. And that is joy.
&quot;Rejoice!&quot; uses harmonics to represent joy as an elevated state of spiritual thought.

Harmonically, Gubaidulina&#x27;s music resists traditional tonal centers and triadic structures in favor of pitch clusters and intervallic design arising from the contrapuntal interaction between melodic voices. For example, in the &quot;Cello Concerto Detto-2&quot; (1972) she notes that a strict and progressive intervallic process occurs, in which the opening section utilizes successively wider intervals that become narrower toward the last section.

Rhythmically, Gubaidulina places significant stress on the fact that temporal ratios, i.e, rhythmic structures, should not be limited to local figuration; rather, the temporality of the musical form should be the defining feature of rhythmic character. As Gerard McBurney states:
In conversation she is most keen to stress that she cannot accept the idea (a frequent post-serial one) of rhythm or duration as the material of a piece. ... To her, rhythm is nowadays a generating principle as, for instance, the cadence was to tonal composers of the Classical period; it therefore cannot be the surface material of a work. ... [S]he expresses her impatience with Messiaen, whose use of rhythmic modes to generate local imagery, she feels, restricts the effectiveness of rhythm as an underlying formal level of the music.

To this end, Gubaidulina often devises durational ratios in order to create the temporal forms for her compositions. Specifically, she often utilizes elements of the Fibonacci sequence or the golden ratio, in which each succeeding element is equal to the sum of the two preceding elements (i.e., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.). This numerical layout represents the balanced nature in her music through a sense of cell multiplication between live and non-live substances. She believes that this abstract theory is the foundation of her personal musical expression. The golden ratio between the sections are always marked by some musical event, and the composer explores her fantasy fully in articulating this moment.

The first work in which Gubaidulina experiments with this concept of proportionality is &quot;Perceptions&quot; for Soprano, Baritone, and Seven String Instruments (1981, rev. 1983–86). The 12th movement, &quot;Montys Tod&quot; (Monty&#x27;s Death), uses the Fibonacci series in its rhythmical structure with the number of quarter notes in individual episodes corresponding to numbers from the Fibonacci series.

In the early 1980s, she began to use the Fibonacci sequence as a way of structuring the form of the work. Her use of the Fibonacci sequence to determine phrase and rhythm length replaces traditional form, creating a new form which to her is more spiritually in tune. Gubaidulina also experimented with other like series, including the Lucas Series which begins by adding 2 instead of 1 to the initial value; the only thing setting it apart from Fibonacci. These forms are still fluid, as every other movement in her symphony &quot;Stimmen... Verstummen...&quot; follows the Fibonacci form. &quot;It is a game!&quot;, she would claim. Later the Lucas and Evangelist series, sequences derived from that of Fibonacci, were added to her repertoire.

Valentina Kholopova, Gubaidulina&#x27;s close friend and colleague, outlined the composer&#x27;s form techniques in detail. In addition to using number sequences, Kholopova describes Gubaidulina&#x27;s use of &quot;expression parameters&quot;; these being articulation, melody, rhythm, texture, and composition. The name suggests the immediate effects of each parameter on the listener. Each of these exists on a scale of consonance to dissonance, together forming the &quot;parameter complex&quot;. For example, she describes a consonant articulation as legato, and a dissonant one as staccato, but each of these can change from piece to piece.

According to Kholopova, music from before the 20th century left the responsibility of articulation to the performer, while now it begs to be more heavily illustrated by the composer. She also cites the writings of Viktor Bobrovski on his research on macrothemes, or central ideas that may occupy larger frames of time, such as entire sections of a piece. With this scale, pieces such as her &quot;Concordanza&quot; assume a mosaic form held together by Fibonacci-derived groupings of expression parameters, &quot;modulating&quot; between consonance and dissonance. This technique appears most clearly in her &quot;Ten Preludes for Solo Cello&quot; as six of its movements are names after modulation between parameters, and two being single parameters. Kholopova proposed that this scale could be used to analyze the music of any 20th century composer focused on texture, timbre and color, and that it is but one way to analyze music, signalling a continuing progression, catalyzed, according to Gubaidulina, by Webern.

==Piano music==

Gubaidulina&#x27;s entire piano output belongs to her earlier compositional period and consists of the following works: &quot;Chaconne&quot; (1962), Piano Sonata (1965), &quot;Musical Toys&quot; (1968), &quot;Toccata-Troncata&quot; (1971), &quot;Invention&quot; (1974) and Piano Concerto &quot;Introitus&quot; (1978). Some of the titles reveal her interest in baroque genres and the influence of J. S. Bach.

The Piano Sonata is dedicated to Henrietta Mirvis, a pianist greatly admired by the composer. The work follows the classical formal structure in 3 movements: &quot;Allegro&quot; (sonata form), &quot;Adagio&quot;, and &quot;Allegretto&quot;. Four motives (pitch sets) are utilized throughout the entire sonata, which also constitute the cyclical elements upon which the rhetoric of the piece is constructed. Each motive is given a particular name: &quot;spring&quot;, &quot;struggle&quot;, &quot;consolation&quot;, and &quot;faith&quot;.

There are two elements in the primary thematic complex of the first movement: (1) a &quot;swing&quot; theme, characterized by syncopation and dotted rhythms and (2) a chord progression, juxtaposing minor and major seconds over an ostinato pattern in the left hand. The slower secondary theme introduces a melodic element associated with the ostinato element of the previous theme.

In the development section, these sets are explored melodically, while the dotted rhythm figure gains even more importance. In the recapitulation, the chord progression of the first thematic complex is brought to the higher registers, preparing the coda based on secondary theme cantabile element, which gradually broadens.

The second movement shifts to a different expressive world. A simple ternary form with a cadenza–AB (cadenza) A, the B section represents an acoustic departure as the chromatic figurations in the left hand, originating in section A, are muted.

In the cadenza the performer improvises within a framework given by the composer, inviting a deeper exploration of the secrets of sound. It consists of two alternating elements– open-sounding strings, stroke by fingers, with no pitch determination, and muted articulation of the strings in the bass register—separated by rests marked with fermatas. 

The third movement is constructed of 7 episodes, in which there is a continuous liberation of energy accumulated during the previous movement.

Two distinct aspects of the sonata—the driving force and the meditative state—can be seen through the architecture of the work as portraying the image of the cross. The first movement is related to the &quot;horizontal&quot; line, which symbolizes human experience while the second movement reflects the &quot;vertical&quot; line, which represents man&#x27;s striving for full realization in the Divine. The meeting point of these two lines in music happens at the end of the second movement, and that reflects transformation of the human being at crossing these two dimensions. The third movement &quot;celebrates the newly obtained freedom of the spirit&quot;.

The Steinway grand piano she has in her home was a gift from Rostropovich.

<text>In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Holy Sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, most often simply referred to as the sacrament, is the ordinance in which participants eat bread and drink water in remembrance of the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Normally, the sacrament is provided every Sunday as part of the sacrament meeting, the primary weekly worship service, in each LDS Church congregation.

Latter-day Saint adherents regard partaking of the sacrament to be a commandment of Jesus Christ; participating in it demonstrates a willingness to remember the atonement of Jesus Christ.

==Sacrament ceremony==

===Administration of the sacrament to the congregation===
In LDS sacrament meetings, the sacrament is passed to members of the congregation after being blessed by a priest from the Aaronic priesthood or a member of the Melchizedek priesthood. The sacrament table is prepared before the meeting begins, usually by teachers, by placing whole slices of bread on trays and filling small individual water cups, which are also held in trays. Both bread and water trays are then covered with white cloth. After introductory prayers, administrative business, and announcements, the sacrament portion of the service begins. It is customary for the congregation to sing a hymn while the bread is uncovered and prepared. The congregation remains seated while the priesthood representatives stand and break bread into bite-sized pieces. The breaking of the bread represents the broken body of Christ. After breaking the bread and the conclusion of the hymn, the priesthood holder kneels and says a set prayer on the broken bread. The bread is passed to the congregation by priesthood holders, usually by deacons. The prayer on the bread is found in the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants:

:&quot;O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it; that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he has given them, that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.&quot; (Book of Moroni 4:3, Doctrine and Covenants 20:77).

After the bread is passed to the congregation, the bread trays are placed on the table and covered with the white cloth. The water trays are then uncovered and a set prayer is given on the water, which is then passed to the congregation. The prayer on the water indicates that the water represents the shed blood of Christ:

:&quot;O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee, in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this [water] to the souls of all those who drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.&quot; (Book of Moroni 5:2, Doctrine and Covenants 20:79).

After the water is passed to the congregation, the water trays are covered with the bread trays for the remainder of the service. The leftover bread and water are discarded.

Latter-day Saints believe the bread and water to be symbols, not the actual body and blood of Christ, and that it is meant for those who have been baptized to &quot;renew their baptismal covenants,&quot; although any person of any or no faith is permitted to partake, and it is common for children under the minimum baptismal age to partake as well.

==Changes in sacrament administration==
Weekly administration of the sacrament in the LDS Church did not begin until the 1850s.

Until the late 1890s or early-20th century, the entire congregation often kneeled during the sacramental prayers, but current practice requires that only the individual giving the prayer kneel. Deacons and teachers did not originally take part in the preparing or passing of the sacrament, a practice which was first adopted in 1898 and was widely implemented in the 1920s or 1930s.

Individual water cups, instead of drinking from a common cup, were introduced in 1911 in response to the Spanish flu.

Passing the sacrament first to the presiding church authority was emphasized in 1946.

===Temporary adjustments===

* Occasionally, a lack of access to bread will result in the use of food other than bread in the sacrament. For instance, after the Second World War, members in Switzerland, under heavy food rationing, &quot;were so anxious to partake of the sacrament that they purchased some potato peelings which cost fifty dollars and used these in place of bread.&quot;
* On March 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders of the church announced a temporary suspension of all large meetings for members of the church worldwide, including weekly sacrament meetings. Among the instructions given during this period of time was the directive that the bishops of each congregation ensure that those over whom they have stewardship receive the sacrament at least once a month during this period of time.

==Meaning of the sacrament==
The sacrament is viewed by adherents as a renewal of a member&#x27;s covenant made at baptism. According to the sacramental prayers, a person eats and drinks in remembrance of the body and blood of Jesus, promises to always remember him, take his name upon them, and keep his commandments. In return, the prayer promises that the participant will always have his spirit to be with them.

The sacrament is considered the most sacred and important element of normal Sabbath day observance and as such is approached by Latter-day Saints with reverence and in a spirit of penitence. Consequently, all who partake of the sacrament are encouraged to examine their own consciences and prayerfully gauge their own worthiness to do so. If they feel unworthy, they are encouraged to refrain from participating in the sacrament until they have properly repented of their sins. Partaking of the sacrament by non-members and unbaptized members is permissible (except in cases where the person has been excommunicated by the church), but the unbaptized are regarded as not having part of the covenant associated with the sacrament.

<text>Annea Lockwood (born July 29, 1939, in Christchurch, New Zealand) is a New Zealand-born American composer and academic musician. She taught electronic music at Vassar College. Her range is vast and often includes microtonal, electro-acoustic soundscapes and vocal music, as well as recordings of natural found sounds. She has also recorded Fluxus-inspired pieces involving burning or drowning pianos.

==Early life and education==
Lockwood studied composition and completed a Bachelor of Music with honours from the University of Canterbury. Her composition studies continued with Peter Racine Fricker at the Royal College of Music from 1961 to 1963; with Gottfried Michael Koenig at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse from 1963 to 1964; and at the Hochschule für Musik Köln. She also studied in the Netherlands. Lockwood settled in London in 1964.

==Career and style==
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Lockwood performed and composed around Europe. Her compositions featured non-conventional instruments such as glass tubing used in &quot;The Glass Concert&quot; (1967). This was published in &quot;&quot; then recorded and released by Tangent Records. Her series &quot;Piano Transplants&quot; utilized burning, drowning, or planting pianos in locations across the United Kingdom and United States. In the 1970s, Lockwood began to compose music that could be classified as performance art pieces, as the essence of the compositional ideas made the audience and environment agents in one piece. She collaborated with various choreographers, sound poets, and visual artists.

In 1973, Lockwood relocated to New York City after being offered a faculty role at Hunter College. She worked with environmental sounds, capturing them and building developed compositions around an environmental inspiration, as in &quot;A Sound Map of the Hudson River&quot; (1982) and &quot;World Rhythms&quot; (1975). She also built on the archetypes and conversations with significant people, as in &quot;Conversations with the Ancestors&quot; (1979), composed on conversations with four women in their 80s; and &quot;Delta Run&quot; (1982) based on a conversation with sculptor Walter Wincha. &quot;Three Short Stories and Apotheosis&quot; (1985) used what Lockwood named the Soundball, which was a foam-covered ball made of six small speakers and a radio receiver. The impetus for this unusual piece of equipment was to &quot;put sound into the hands of the dancers.&quot; She also works with the sounds of water.

In the 1990s, her pieces were written for acoustic-electric instruments and incorporated multi-media and indigenous instruments. &quot;Thousand Year Dreaming&quot; (1991) used four didgeridoos and blends images of the Lascaux Cave as part of the performance. In 2002, she began working on &quot;A Sound Map of the Danube River&quot;, which gathered sounds recorded from a variety of sites on the surface of, within, and around the river.

Lockwood&#x27;s work has been presented at festivals around the world. Her piece &quot;Piano Burning&quot; has been replicated multiple times, including as the closing track of the 2019 album &quot;There Existed An Addiction To Blood&quot; by the experimental hip-hop group clipping. She has received the Henry Cowell Award (2007) and was featured in the short documentary &quot;Annea Lockwood / a Film About Listening&quot; (2021) and live documentary &quot;32 Sounds&quot; (2022), both directed by Sam Green. Her recordings are currently distributed by Lovely, XI, ?What Next?/OO Discs, Rattle Records (NZ), Harmonia Mundi, Earth Ear, CRI, and Finnadar/Atlantic.

Lockwood is an emeritus professor at Vassar College, where she has worked since 1982. Former students include Jonathan Elliott.

<text>Organizers within trade unions have sought to increase the bargaining power of workers in regards to collective bargaining by acting in collaboration with other trade unions. Multi-union organizing can take place on an informal basis, or on a more formal basis via an umbrella organization comprising multiple trade unions. Such umbrella organizations may be referred to as a trade union federation, trade union confederation, or a trade union centre.

==Background==
A prominent example of trade union federations is the national trade union federation— national trade union confederation or centre—which are composed of trade unions within a particular country. Most countries have a national trade union federation, with many countries having more than one. 

The largest national trade union federation is the All-China Federation of Trade Unions with a total membership of 302 million as of 2017. 

From 1935 to 1955 in the United States, there were two competing national trade union federations: the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The AFL comprised primarily craft unions and was oriented towards the moderate and conservative end of the labour movement, while the CIO primarily comprised industrial unions which tended to be more radical. Prior to their reunification into the AFL-CIO in 1955, the two federations competed with each other for affiliates and influence. Even following their amalgamation, the AFL-CIO faced a split again in 2005 by the Change to Win Federation.

In some regions, such as the Nordic countries, different federations exist on a sectoral basis, for example, for blue collar workers and professionals.

As well as national federations, trade unions may establish international federations, either along industry lines as with global union federations such as the UITBB and the International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation, or across multiple industries, as with the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). One of the ITUC&#x27;s predecessors, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), was founded as an anti-communist splinter of the WFTU.

Some federations may be founded as cross sections of workers organization and religious attitudes present, such as present within the Christian socialist or Christian democratic traditions, such as the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC) and the Christian Trade Union Federation of Germany (CGB). A federation may also be founded on explicitly secular grounds such as the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT). Historically, the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions existed as an international federation of Christian trade unions, and later as the World Confederation of Labour, as it expanded to include Muslim and Buddhist trade unions as well. It was the smallest of the 3 major international federations during the cold war, and ended up merging with the ICTFU to form the ITUC.

== History ==

The origins of trade union federations are intertwined with the development of trade unions themselves.

<text>Glinda of Oz is the fourteenth book in the Oz series written by children&#x27;s author L. Frank Baum, published on July 10, 1920. It is the last book of the original Oz series, which was later continued by other authors. Like most of the Oz books, the plot features a journey through some of the remoter regions of Oz; though in this case the pattern is doubled: Dorothy and Ozma travel to stop a war between the Flatheads and Skeezers, and then Glinda and a cohort of Dorothy&#x27;s friends set out to rescue them. The book was dedicated to Baum&#x27;s second son, Robert Stanton Baum. It was followed by &quot;The Royal Book of Oz&quot; (1921).

==Plot==
Princess Ozma and Dorothy travel to an obscure corner of the Land of Oz to prevent a war between two local powers, the Skeezers and the Flatheads. The leaders of the two tribes prove obstinate, and they are determined to fight in spite of Ozma and Dorothy. Unable to prevent the war, Dorothy and Ozma find themselves imprisoned on the Skeezers&#x27; glass-covered island, which has been magically submerged to the bottom of its lake. Their situation worsens when the warlike queen Coo-ee-oh, who is holding them captive and who alone knows how to raise the island back to the surface of the lake, loses her battle and gets transformed into a swan, forgetting all her magic in the process and leaving the inhabitants of the island, with Ozma and Dorothy, trapped at the bottom of the lake. Ozma and Dorothy summon Glinda, who, with help from several magicians and magical assistants, must find a way to raise the island to the surface of the lake again and liberate its inhabitants.

==Original manuscript==
The printed text of the book features one significant change from Baum&#x27;s manuscript. In the manuscript, Red Reera first appears as a skeleton, its bones wired together, with glowing red eyes in the sockets of its skull. The printed text makes Reera the Red first appear as a gray ape in an apron and lace cap — a comical sight rather than a frightening and disturbing specter. The change was most likely made by Baum at the suggestion of his editors. Other changes in the manuscript, made by an unknown editor at Reilly &amp; Lee, are relatively trivial, and it has been suggested that they do not always improve the text.

The submerged city of the Skeezers in this book may have been suggested to Baum by the semi-submerged Temple of Isis at Philae in Egypt, which the Baums had seen on their trip to Europe and Egypt in the first six months of 1906.

<text>Mihrab (, &#x27;, pl.&#x27;) is a niche in the wall of a mosque that indicates the &quot;qibla&quot;, the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca towards which Muslims should face when praying. The wall in which a &quot;mihrab&quot; appears is thus the &quot;&quot;qibla&quot; wall&quot;.

The &quot;minbar&quot;, which is the raised platform from which an imam (leader of prayer) addresses the congregation, is located to the right of the &quot;mihrab&quot;.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;miḥrāb&quot; is complicated, and multiple explanations have been proposed by different sources and scholars. It may come from Old South Arabian (possibly Sabaic) &quot;mḥrb&quot; meaning a certain part of a palace, as well as &quot;part of a temple where &quot;tḥrb&quot; (a certain type of visions) is obtained,&quot; from the root word &quot;ḥrb&quot; &quot;to perform a certain religious ritual (which is compared to combat or fighting and described as an overnight retreat) in the &quot;mḥrb&quot; of the temple.&quot; It may also possibly be related to Ethiopic &quot;məkʷrab&quot; &quot;temple, sanctuary,&quot; whose equivalent in Sabaic is &quot;mkrb&quot; of the same meaning, from the root word &quot;krb&quot; &quot;to dedicate&quot; (cognate with Akkadian &quot;karābu&quot; &quot;to bless&quot; and related to Hebrew &quot;kerūḇ&quot; &quot;cherub (either of the heavenly creatures that bound the Ark in the inner sanctuary)&quot;).

Arab lexicographers traditionally derive the word from the Arabic root (Ḥ-R-B) relating to &quot;war, fighting or anger,&quot; (which, though cognate with the South Arabian root, does not however carry any relation to religious rituals) thus leading some to interpret it to mean a &quot;fortress&quot;, or &quot;place of battle (with Satan),&quot; the latter due to mihrabs being private prayer chambers. The latter interpretation though bears similarity to the nature of the &quot;ḥrb&quot; ritual.

The word &quot;mihrab&quot; originally had a non-religious meaning and simply denoted a special room in a house; a throne room in a palace, for example. The Fath al-Bari (p. 458), on the authority of others, suggests the &quot;mihrab&quot; is &quot;the most honorable location of kings&quot; and &quot;the master of locations, the front and the most honorable.&quot; The &quot;Mosques in Islam&quot; (p. 13), in addition to Arabic sources, cites Theodor Nöldeke and others as having considered a &quot;mihrab&quot; to have originally signified a throne room.

The term was subsequently used by the Islamic prophet Muhammad to denote his own private prayer room. The room additionally provided access to the adjacent mosque, and Muhammad entered the mosque through this room. This original meaning of &quot;mihrab&quot; – &quot;i.e.&quot; as a special room in the house – continues to be preserved in some forms of Judaism where &quot;mihrabs&quot; are rooms used for private worship. In the Qur&#x27;an, the word (when in conjunction with the definite article) is mostly used to indicate the Holy of Holies. The term is used, for example, in the verse .

==History==

The earliest &quot;mihrabs&quot; generally consisted of a simple stripe of paint or a flat stone panel in the &quot;qibla&quot; wall. They may have originally had functions similar to a &quot;maqsura&quot;, denoting not only the place where the imam led prayers but also where some official functions, such as the dispensation of justice, were carried out. In the Mosque of the Prophet (&quot;Al-Masjid al-Nabawi&quot;) in Medina, a large block of stone initially marked the north wall which was oriented towards Jerusalem (the first qibla), but this was moved to the south wall in the second year of the &quot;hijra&quot; period (2 AH or 624 CE), when the orientation of the qibla was changed towards Mecca. This &quot;mihrab&quot; also marked the spot where Muhammad would plant his lance (&quot;&#x27;anaza&quot; or &quot;ḥarba&quot;) prior to leading prayers.

During the reign of the Umayyad caliph Al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik (Al-Walid I, &quot;r.&quot; 705–715), the Mosque of the Prophet was renovated and the governor (&quot;wāli&quot;) of Medina, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, ordered that a niche be made to designate the &quot;qibla&quot; wall (which identifies the direction of Mecca), which became the first concave &quot;mihrab&quot; niche. This type of &quot;mihrab&quot; was called &quot;miḥrāb mujawwaf&quot; in historical Arabic texts&quot;.&quot; The origin of this architectural feature has been debated by scholars. Some trace it to the apse of Christian churches, others to the alcove shrines or niches of Buddhist architecture.&quot;&quot; Niches were already a common feature of Late Antique architecture prior to the rise of Islam, either as hollow spaces or to house statues. The &quot;mihrab&quot; niche could have also been related to the recessed area or alcove that sheltered the throne in some royal audience halls.&quot;&quot;

The next earliest concave &quot;mihrab&quot; to be documented is the one that was added to the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus when it was built by Al-Walid between 706 and 715. This was then followed by a &quot;mihrab&quot; added to the Mosque of &#x27;Amr ibn al-&#x27;As in Fustat in 710–711. Subsequently, concave &quot;mihrabs&quot; became widespread across the Muslim world and were adopted as a standard feature of mosques. The oldest surviving concave mihrab today is a marble &quot;mihrab&quot; housed at the Iraq Museum. It is believed to date from the 8th century, possibly made in northern Syria before being moved by the Abbasids to the Great Mosque of al-Mansur in Baghdad. It was then moved again to the al-Khassaki Mosque built in the 17th century, where it was later found and transferred to the museum. This &quot;mihrab&quot; features a combination of Classical or Late Antique motifs, with the niche flanked by two spiral columns and crowned by a scalloped shell-like hood.

Eventually, the niche came to be universally understood to identify the &quot;qibla&quot; wall, and so came to be adopted as a feature in other mosques. A sign was no longer necessary. Today, &quot;mihrabs&quot; vary in size, but are usually ornately decorated. It was common for &quot;mihrabs&quot; to be flanked with pairs of candlesticks, though they would not have lit candles. In Ottoman mosques, these were made of brass, bronze or beaten copper and their bases had a distinctive bell shape.

In exceptional cases, the &quot;mihrab&quot; does not follow the &quot;qibla&quot; direction, such as is the Masjid al-Qiblatayn, or the Mosque of the Two Qiblas, where Muhammad received the command to change the direction of prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca, thus it had two prayer niches. In 1987 the mosque was renovated, the old prayer niche facing Jerusalem was removed, and the one facing Mecca was left.

== Architecture ==
&quot;Mihrabs&quot; are a relevant part of Islamic culture and mosques. Since they are used to indicate the direction for prayer, they serve as an important focal point in the mosque. They are usually decorated with ornamental detail that can be geometric designs, linear patterns, or calligraphy. This ornamentation also serves a religious purpose. The calligraphy decoration on the &quot;mihrabs&quot; are usually from the Qur&#x27;an and are devotions to God so that God&#x27;s word reaches the people. Common designs amongst &quot;mihrabs&quot; are geometric foliage that are close together so that there is no empty space in-between the art.

===Great Mosque of Córdoba===
The &quot;mihrab&quot; in the Great Mosque of Cordoba is a highly decorated piece of art that draws one&#x27;s attention. It is a contribution made by Al-Hakam II that is not just used for prayer. It is used as a place of convergence in the mosque, where visitors could be amazed by its beauty and gilded designs. The entrance is covered in mosaics &quot;which links to the Byzantium tradition, produced by the craftsmen sent by Emperor Nicephorus II. These mosaics extend along the voussoirs with a geometric and plant-based design, but also in the inscriptions which record verses from the Koran&quot;. This &quot;mihrab&quot; is also a bit different from a normal &quot;mihrab&quot; due to its scale. It takes up a whole room instead of just a niche. This style of &quot;mihrab&quot; set a standard for other &quot;mihrab&quot; construction in the region. The use of the horseshoe arch, carved stucco, and glass mosaics made an impression for the aesthetic of &quot;mihrabs&quot;, &quot;although no other extant &quot;mihrab&quot; in Spain or western North Africa is as elaborate.&quot; 

===Great Mosque of Damascus===

The Great Mosque of Damascus was started by al-Walid in 706. It was built as a hypostyle mosque, built with a prayer hall leading to the mihrab, &quot;on the back wall of the sanctuary are four &quot;mihrabs&quot;, two of which are the &quot;mihrab&quot; of the Companions of the Prophet in the eastern half and the great &quot;mihrab&quot; at the end of the transept&quot;. The &quot;mihrab&quot; is decorated similarly to the rest of the mosque in golden vines and vegetal imagery. The lamp that once hung in the &quot;mihrab&quot; has been theorized as the motif of a pearl, due to the indications that dome of the &quot;mihrab&quot; has scalloped edges. There have been other mosques that have &quot;mihrabs&quot; similar to this that follow the same theme, with scalloped domes that are &quot;concave like a conch or mother of pearl shell. The original main &quot;mihrab&quot; of the mosque has not been preserved, having been renovated many times, and the current one is a replacement dating from renovations after a destructive 1893 fire.

<text>Joan Linda La Barbara (born June 8, 1947) is an American vocalist and composer known for her explorations of non-conventional or &quot;extended&quot; vocal techniques. Considered to be a vocal virtuoso in the field of contemporary music, she is credited with advancing a new vocabulary of vocal sounds including trills, whispers, cries, sighs, inhaled tones, and multiphonics (singing two or more pitches simultaneously).

==Biography==
An influential figure in experimental music, La Barbara was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She is a classically trained singer who studied with soprano Helen Boatwright at Syracuse University and contralto Marion Freschl at the Juilliard School in New York.

Joan La Barbara&#x27;s early creative work (early to mid 1970s) focuses on experimentation and investigation of vocal sound as raw sonic material including works that explore varied timbres on a single pitch, circular breathing techniques inspired by horn players, and multiphonic or chordal singing. In the mid 1970s, she began creating more structured compositional works, some of which include electronics and layered voice sounds.

She has accumulated a large repertoire of vocal works by 20th- and 21st-century music masters, including many pieces composed especially for her voice. She has performed and recorded works by composers including John Cage, Robert Ashley, Morton Feldman, Philip Glass, Larry Austin, Peter Gordon, Alvin Lucier, and her husband Morton Subotnick, and has collaborated with choreographer Merce Cunningham, and poet Kenneth Goldsmith. In 2004, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Music Composition. She also received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage Award (2016).

La Barbara is a guest instructor at HB Studio.

==Other work==
Joan La Barbara has also done work acting and composing for television, film, and dance. She composed and performed the music for the Sesame Street animated segment &quot;Signing Alphabet,&quot; for electronics and voice, and has composed a variety of chamber, orchestral, and choral works. She also appears in Matthew Barney’s 2014 film &quot;River of Fundament&quot;. La Barbara is currently on the music composition artist faculty at New York University Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions, and on the faculty of Mannes/The New School/College of Performing Arts.

<text>The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC, U of I, Illinois, or University of Illinois) is a public land-grant research university in the Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area, Illinois, United States. Established in 1867, it is the flagship institution of the University of Illinois System. With over 59,000 students, the University of Illinois is one of the largest public universities by enrollment in the United States.

The university contains 16 schools and colleges and offers more than 150 undergraduate and over 100 graduate programs of study. The university holds 651 buildings on and its annual operating budget in 2016 was over $2 billion. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign also operates a research park home to innovation centers for over 90 start-up companies and multinational corporations.

The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. In fiscal year 2019, research expenditures at Illinois totaled $652 million. The campus library system possesses the fourth-largest university library in the United States by holdings. The university also hosts the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.

== History ==
===Illinois Industrial University (1867–1885)===

The University of Illinois, originally named &quot;Illinois Industrial University&quot;, was one of the 37 universities created under the first Morrill Land-Grant Act, which provided public land for the creation of agricultural and industrial colleges and universities across the United States. Among several cities, Urbana was selected in 1867 as the site for the new school. From the beginning, President John Milton Gregory&#x27;s desire to establish an institution firmly grounded in the liberal arts tradition was at odds with many state residents and lawmakers who wanted the university to offer classes based solely around &quot;industrial education&quot;. The university opened for classes on March 2, 1868, and had two faculty members and 77 students.

The library, which opened with the school in 1868, started with 1,039 volumes. Subsequently, President Edmund J. James, in a speech to the board of trustees in 1912, proposed to create a research library. It is now one of the world&#x27;s largest public academic collections. In 1870, the Mumford House was constructed as a model farmhouse for the school&#x27;s experimental farm. The Mumford House remains the oldest structure on campus. The original University Hall (1871) was the fourth building built; it stood where the Illini Union stands today.

The University of Illinois&#x27; Undergraduate Library (UGL) was constructed underground to preserve open space on campus and to prevent casting shadows on the adjacent Morrow Plots, the oldest continually used experimental agricultural fields in the United States. This unique design inspired The Other Guys, a student a cappella group, to create the &quot;Morrow Plots Song,&quot; humorously explaining that the library was built underground &quot;&#x27;Cause you can&#x27;t throw shade on the corn&quot;.
 The song has become a beloved piece among students and alumni, celebrating the university&#x27;s history and traditions.

===University of Illinois (1885–1977)===

In 1885, the Illinois Industrial University officially changed its name to the &quot;University of Illinois&quot;, reflecting its agricultural, mechanical, and liberal arts curriculum. According to educational historian Roger L. Geiger, Illinois and a few other public and private universities set the standard for what the research university in the United States would become.
During his presidency, Edmund J. James (1904–1920) set the policy of building a massive research library. He also laid the foundation for the large Chinese international student population on campus. James established ties with China through the Chinese Minister to the United States Wu Ting-Fang. Class rivalries and Bob Zuppke&#x27;s winning football teams contributed to campus morale.

&quot;Alma Mater&quot;, a prominent statue on campus created by alumnus Lorado Taft, was unveiled on June 11, 1929. It was funded from donations by the Alumni Fund and the classes of 1923–1929.

The Great Depression in the United States slowed construction and expansion on the campus. The university replaced the original university hall with Gregory Hall and the Illini Union. After World War II, the university experienced rapid growth. The enrollment doubled and the academic standing improved. This period was also marked by large growth in the Graduate College and increased federal support of scientific and technological research. During the 1950s and 1960s the university experienced the turmoil common on many American campuses. Among these were the water fights of the 1950s and 1960s.

===University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (1977–present)===

By 1967, the University of Illinois system consisted of a main campus in Champaign-Urbana and two Chicago campuses, Chicago Circle (UICC) and Medical Center (UIMC), and people began using &quot;Urbana-Champaign&quot; or the reverse to refer to the main campus specifically. The university name officially changed to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by 1977 (although the word &quot;at&quot; was later dropped for marketing purposes by all U of I System campuses by 2021). While this was a reversal of the commonly used designation for the metropolitan area (Champaign-Urbana), a majority of the campus is located in Urbana. The name change established a separate identity for the main campus within the University of Illinois System, which today includes separate institutions at the University of Illinois Chicago (formed by the merger of UICC and UIMC) and University of Illinois Springfield.

In 1998, the Hallene Gateway Plaza was dedicated. The Plaza features the original sandstone portal of University Hall, which was originally the fourth building on campus. In recent years, state support has declined from 4.5% of the state&#x27;s tax appropriations in 1980 to 2.28% in 2011, a nearly 50% decline. As a result, the university&#x27;s budget has shifted away from relying on state support with nearly 84% of the budget coming from other sources in 2012.

On March 12, 2015, the Board of Trustees approved the creation of a medical school, the first college created at Urbana-Champaign in 60 years. The Carle Illinois College of Medicine began classes in 2018.

===Philanthropy===
Over the last twenty years state funding for the university has fallen. Private philanthropy increasingly supplements revenue from tuition and state funding, providing about 19% of the annual budget in 2012. Notable among significant donors, alumnus entrepreneur Thomas M. Siebel has committed nearly $150 million to the university, including $36 million to build the Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science, $25 million to build the Siebel Center for Design, and $50 million to support the renamed Department of Computer Science to become Siebel School of Computing and Data Science. Furthermore, the Grainger Foundation (founded by alumnus W. W. Grainger) has contributed more than $300 million to the university over the last half-century, including donations for the construction of the Grainger Engineering Library. Larry Gies and his wife Beth donated $150 million in 2017 to the shortly thereafter renamed Gies College of Business.

==Campus==

The main research and academic facilities are divided almost evenly between the twin cities of Urbana and Champaign, which form part of the Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area. Some parts are in Urbana Township.

Four main quads compose the center of the university and are arranged from north to south. The Beckman Quadrangle and the John Bardeen Quadrangle occupy the center of the Engineering Campus. Boneyard Creek flows through the John Bardeen Quadrangle, parallel to Green Street. The Beckman Quadrangle, named after Arnold Orville Beckman, is primarily composed of research units and laboratories, and features a large solar calendar consisting of an obelisk and several copper fountains. The Main Quadrangle and South Quadrangle follow immediately after the John Bardeen Quad. The former makes up a large part of the Liberal Arts and Sciences portion of the campus, while the latter comprises many of the buildings of the College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences (ACES) spread across the campus map.

Additionally, the research fields of the College of ACES stretch south from Urbana and Champaign into Savoy and Champaign County. The university also maintains formal gardens and a conference center in nearby Monticello at Allerton Park.

The campus is known for its landscape and architecture, as well as distinctive landmarks. It was identified as one of 50 college or university &quot;works of art&quot; by T.A. Gaines in his book &quot;The Campus as a Work of Art&quot;. The campus also has a number of buildings and sites on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places including Harker Hall, the Astronomical Observatory, Louise Freer Hall, the Main Library, the Experimental Dairy Farm Historic District, and the Morrow Plots. University of Illinois Willard Airport is one of the few airports owned by an educational institution.

===Sustainability===

In 2008, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign became a signatory of the American College and University Presidents&#x27; Climate Commitment, binding the campus to the goal of carbon neutrality as soon as possible. In 2010, the first Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) was written to chart a path to this goal. The iCAP is a strategic framework for meeting the university&#x27;s Climate Leadership Commitments to be carbon-neutral by 2050 or sooner and build resilience with its local community. Since then, the iCAP has been rewritten every five years to track the university&#x27;s progress.

In December 2013, the University of Illinois launched the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE) on the Urbana-Champaign campus. The institute, under the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, leads an interdisciplinary approach to researching solutions for the world&#x27;s most pressing sustainability, energy, and environmental needs. In addition, iSEE has engaged students, faculty, staff, and campus leadership in the iCAP process — especially in the areas of zero waste and conservation of energy, food, water, land, and natural resources — as well as sustainability outreach and immersive educational programs.

In 2022, new solar and geothermal energy projects, a reduction in water use, and wide-ranging sustainability research helped the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign earn its fifth consecutive gold certification in the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (STARS). Illinois has consistently achieved gold certification since it began reporting data through STARS in 2013, and the 2022 score was one of its highest to date.

Currently, the campus features 27 LEED-certified buildings.

==Academics==
As of 2024, 87% of students graduate within 8 years of entering, compared to the national median of 58% for all 4-year universities nationwide.

===Undergraduate admissions===
The overall first-year admit rate for 2023 is 43.7%, which differ greatly among UIUC colleges — whereas the overall first-choice admit rate is 34.7%, the Grainger College of Engineering has an admit rate of 22.3%. Certain in-demand majors like Computer Science, including Computer Science + X, of which the program being ranked consistently 5th nationwide can be extremely competitive, with an acceptance rate of less than 6.8% in 2022,

 and average freshman ACT composite score of 33.7.



In 2009, an investigation by &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that some applicants &quot;received special consideration&quot; for acceptance between 2005 and 2009, despite having sub-par qualifications. This incident became known as the University of Illinois clout scandal.

===Academic divisions===
The university offers more than 150 undergraduate and 100 graduate and professional programs in over 15 academic units, among several online specializations such as Digital Marketing and an online MBA program launched in January 2016. In 2015, the university announced its expansion to include an engineering-based medical program, which would be the first new college created in Urbana-Champaign in 60 years. The university also offers undergraduate students the opportunity for graduation honors. University Honors is an academic distinction awarded to the highest achieving students. To earn the distinction, students must have a cumulative grade point average of a 3.5/4.0 within the academic year of their graduation and rank within the top 3% of their graduating class. Their names are inscribed on a Bronze Tablet that hangs in the Main Library.

===Online learning===
In addition to the university&#x27;s Illinois Online platform, in 2015 the university entered into a partnership with the Silicon Valley educational technology company Coursera to offer a series of master&#x27;s degrees, certifications, and specialization courses, currently including more than 70 joint learning classes. In August 2015, the Master of Business Administration program was launched through the platform. On March 31, 2016, Coursera announced the launch of the Master of Computer Science in Data Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. At the time, the university&#x27;s computer-science graduate program was ranked fifth in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. On March 29, 2017, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign launched their Master&#x27;s in Accounting (iMSA) program, now called the Master of Science in Accountancy (iMSA) program. The iMSA program is led through live sessions, headed by UIUC faculty.

Similar to the university&#x27;s on-campus admission policies, the online master&#x27;s degrees offered by The University of Illinois through Coursera also has admission requirements. All applicants must hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and have earned a 3.0 GPA or higher in the last two years of study. Additionally, all applicants must prove their proficiency in English.

The University of Illinois also offers online courses in partnership with Coursera, such as &quot;Marketing in a Digital&quot; &quot;World,&quot; which focuses on how digital tools like internet, smartphone and 3D printers are changing the marketing landscape.

Tenants of the Research Park facilities include prominent Fortune 500 companies Capital One, John Deere, State Farm, Caterpillar, and Yahoo, Inc. Companies also employ about 400 total student interns at any given time throughout the year. The complex is also a center for entrepreneurs, and has over 50 startup companies stationed at its EnterpriseWorks Incubator facility.

In 2011, Urbana, Illinois was named number 11 on Popular Mechanics&#x27; &quot;14 Best Startup Cities in America&quot; list, in a large part due to the contributions of Research Park&#x27;s programs. The park has gained recognition from other notable publications, such as inc.com and Forbes magazine. For the 2011 fiscal year, Research Park produced an economic output of $169.5M for the state of Illinois.

===Notable discoveries and innovations===
In the field of natural sciences, the BCS theory, a groundbreaking theory of superconductivity, was proposed by John Bardeen in collaboration with Leon Cooper and his doctoral student John Robert Schrieffer. Their work earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972. In the realm of agricultural science, John Laughnan, while a professor, developed sweet corn with higher-than-normal sugar content, a significant advancement in crop science.

In computer and applied sciences, several notable achievements originated from the University of Illinois. The ILLIAC I, built in 1952, was the first computer entirely constructed and owned by a U.S. educational institution. It was also used by Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Issacson to create the &quot;Illiac Suite&quot;, the first known composition written by an electronic computer. The development of LLVM, initially started by Vikram Adve and Chris Lattner, is now recognized as a major project in compiler infrastructure. Another milestone was the development of the Mosaic web browser at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in 1993.

NAMD, a molecular dynamics simulation code, was pioneered by Klaus Schulten and his team at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, further advancing computational biophysics. The PLATO system, also developed at the University of Illinois, was the first generalized computer assisted instruction system, which by the late 1970s supported thousands of terminals globally, introducing many concepts foundational to modern multi-user computing such as forums, instant messaging, and online testing. In terms of interface technologies, Donald Bitzer was instrumental in the 1960s development of both touchscreens and plasma displays. Furthermore, Doug Brown and David R. Woolley created Talkomatic in 1973 on the PLATO system, an early online chat system enabling real-time text communication among small groups.

In the realm of audio-visual technology, Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner publicly demonstrated for the first time a motion picture with a soundtrack optically recorded directly onto the film in 1922.

==Student life==
===Student body===
As of spring 2018, the university had 45,813 students. , over 10,000 students were international students, and of them 5,295 were Mainland Chinese. The university also recruits students from over 100 countries among its 32,878 undergraduate students and 10,245 graduate and professional students. The gender breakdown is 55% men, 45% women. UIUC in 2014 enrolled 4,898 students from China, more than any other American university. They comprise the largest group of international students on the campus, followed by South Korea (1,268 in fall 2014) and India (1,167). Graduate enrollment of Chinese students at UIUC has grown from 649 in 2000 to 1,973 in 2014.

===Student organizations===

The university has over 1,000 active registered student organizations, showcased at the start of each academic year during Illinois&#x27;s &quot;Quad Day.&quot; Registration and support is provided by the Student Programs &amp; Activities Office, an administrative arm established in pursuit of the larger social, intellectual, and educative goals of the Illini Student Union. The Office&#x27;s mission is to &quot;enhance ... classroom education,&quot; &quot;meet the needs and desires of the campus community,&quot; and &quot;prepare students to be contributing and humane citizens.&quot; Beyond student organizations, The Daily Illini is a student-run newspaper that has been published for the community of since 1871. The paper is published by Illini Media Company, a not-for-profit which also prints other publications, and operates WPGU 107.1 FM, a student-run commercial radio station. The Varsity Men&#x27;s Glee Club is an all-male choir at the University of Illinois that was founded in 1886. The Varsity Men&#x27;s Glee Club is one of the oldest glee clubs in the United States as well as the oldest registered student organization at the University of Illinois. As of 2018, the university also has the largest chapter of Alpha Phi Omega with over 340 active members.

====Greek life====
There are 59 fraternities and 38 sororities on campus. Of the approximately 30,366 undergraduates, 3,463 are members of sororities and 3,674 are members of fraternities. The Greek system at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a system of self-government. While staff advisors and directors manage certain aspects of the Greek community, most of the day-to-day operations of the Greek community are governed by the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council. A smaller minority of fraternities and sororities fall under the jurisdiction of the Black Greek Council and United Greek Council; the Black Greek Council serves historically black Greek organizations while the United Greek council comprises other multicultural organizations. Many of the fraternity and sorority houses on campus are on the National Register of Historic Places.

====Student government====

U of I has an extensive history of past student governments. Two years after the university opened in 1868, John Milton Gregory and a group of students created a constitution for a student government. Their governance expanded to the entire university in 1873, having a legislative, executive, and judicial branch. For a period of time, this government had the ability to discipline students. In 1883, however, due to a combination of events from Gregory&#x27;s resignation to student-faculty infighting, the government formally dissolved itself via plebiscite.

It was not until 1934, when the Student Senate, the next university-wide student government, was created. A year before, future U of I Dean of Students, Fred H. Turner and the university&#x27;s Senate Committee on Student Affairs gave increased power to the Student Council, an organization primarily known for organizing dances. A year after, the Student Council created a constitution and became the Student Senate, under the oversight of the Committee on Student Affairs. This Student Senate would last for 35 years. The Student Senate changed its purpose and name in 1969, when it became the Undergraduate Student Association (UGSA). It ceased being a representational government, becoming a collective bargaining agency instead. It often worked with the Graduate Student Association to work on various projects

In 1967, Bruce A. Morrison and other U of I graduate founded the Graduate Student Association (GSA). GSA would last until 1978, when it merged with the UGSA to form the Champaign-Urbana Student Association (CUSA). CUSA lasted for only two years when it was replaced by the Student Government Association (SGA) in 1980. SGA lasted for 15 years until it became the Illinois Student Government (ISG) in 1995. ISG lasted until 2004.

The current university student government, created in 2004, is the Illinois Student Senate, a combined undergraduate and graduate student senate with 54 voting members. The student senators are elected by college and represent the students in the Urbana-Champaign Senate (which comprises both faculty and students), as well as on a variety of faculty and administrative committees, and are led by an internally elected executive board of a President, External Vice President, Internal Vice President, and Treasurer. , the executive board is supported by an executive staff consisting of a Chief of Staff, Clerk of the Senate, Parliamentarian, Director of Communications, Intern Coordinator, and the Historian of the Senate.

===Residence halls===

The university provides housing for undergraduates through 24 residence halls in both Urbana and Champaign. Incoming freshmen are required to live in student housing (campus or certified) their first year on campus. The university also maintains two graduate residence halls, which are restricted to students who are sophomores or above, and three university-owned apartment complexes. Some undergraduates choose to move into apartments or the Greek houses after their first year. There are a number of private dormitories around campus, as well as 15 private, certified residences that partner with the university to offer a variety of different housing options, including ones that are cooperatives, single-gender or religiously affiliated. The university is known for being one of the first universities to provide accommodations for students with disabilities. In 2015, the University of Illinois announced that they would be naming its newest residence hall after Carlos Montezuma also known as Wassaja. Wassaja is the first Native American graduate and is believed to be one of the first Native Americans to receive a medical degree.

===Libraries and museums===

Among universities in North America, only the collections of Harvard are larger. Currently, the University of Illinois&#x27; 20+ departmental libraries and divisions hold more than 24 million items, including more than 12 million print volumes. , it had also the largest &quot;browsable&quot; university library in the United States, with 5 million volumes directly accessible in stacks in a single location. University of Illinois also has the largest public engineering library (Grainger Engineering Library) in the country. In addition to the main library building, which houses numerous subject-oriented libraries, the Isaac Funk Family Library on the South Quad serves the College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences and the Grainger Engineering Library Information Center serves the College of Engineering on the John Bardeen Quad.
Residence Hall Library System is one of three in the nation. The Residence Hall Libraries were created in 1948 to serve the educational, recreational, and cultural information needs of first- and second-year undergraduate students residing in the residence halls, and the living-learning communities within the residence halls. The collection also serves University Housing staff as well as the larger campus community. The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library (RBML) is one of the Special collections units within the University Library. The RBML is one of the largest special collections repositories in the United States.

The university has several museums, galleries, and archives which include Krannert Art Museum, Sousa Archives and Center for American Music and Spurlock Museum. Gallery and exhibit locations include Krannert Center for the Performing Arts and at the School of Art and Design.

===Recreation===

The campus has two main recreation facilities, the Activities and Recreation Center (ARC) and the Campus Recreation Center – East (CRCE). Originally known as the Intramural Physical Education Building (IMPE) and opened in 1971, IMPE was renovated in 2006 and reopened in August 2008 as the ARC. The renovations expanded the facility, adding 103,433 square feet to the existing structure and costing $54.9 million. This facility is touted by the university as &quot;one of the country&#x27;s largest on-campus recreation centers.&quot; CRCE was originally known as the Satellite Recreation Center and was opened in 1989. The facility was renovated in 2005 to expand the space and update equipment, officially reopening in March 2005 as CRCE.

===Transportation===

The bus system that operates throughout the campus and community is operated by the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District. The MTD receives a student-approved transportation fee from the university, which provides unlimited access for university students, faculty, and staff.

Daily Amtrak trains through Illinois Terminal connect Champaign-Urbana with Chicago and Carbondale, Illinois. This includes the corridor service &quot;Illini and Saluki&quot; and the long-distance &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;, which provides a direct route to Memphis, Tennessee; Jackson, Mississippi; and New Orleans, Louisiana southbound, in addition to Chicago northbound.

Willard Airport, opened in 1954 and is named for former University of Illinois president Arthur Cutts Willard. The airport is located in Savoy. Willard Airport is home to University research projects, along with flights from American Airlines. In 2013, the university&#x27;s Institute of Aviation was closed at the University of Illinois and the program was transferred to Parkland College.

===Security===
The University of Illinois has a dedicated police department, UIPD, which operates independently from CPD, the department that serves the surrounding Champaign area.

On June 9, 2017, Yingying Zhang, a Chinese international student, was abducted and murdered in a case that made national headlines at the time. The university subsequently announced plans to install additional, high-definition, security cameras across the campus.

On April 18, 2022, Sayed A. Quraishi, a 23-year-old man who had recently graduated from the university, assaulted a Jewish student outside of the campus&#x27; Hillel building during an anti-Israel protest organized by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). Quraishi was subsequently charged with a hate crime.

In July 2022, the university announced that it was partnering with local businesses to invest $300,000 to combat violent crime in Champaign County.

In September 2022, the City of Champaign transferred responsibility for a large swath of Campustown from CPD (Champaign Police Department) to UIPD, claiming that doing so would reduce response times and improve the quality of service. As part of the jurisdictional reforms, the city agreed to pay a substantial portion of the cost to hire seven new officers to patrol the new coverage area.

Violent crime fell sharply in 2022 compared to the year prior, with shootings and homicides declining by 50 and 47 percent, respectively. The city attributed the decrease in crime to improved staffing levels and the installation of automatic license plate readers.

==Athletics==

U of I&#x27;s Division of Intercollegiate Athletics fields teams for ten men&#x27;s and eleven women&#x27;s varsity sports. The university participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I. The university&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Fighting Illini. The university operates a number of athletic facilities, including Memorial Stadium for football, the State Farm Center for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, and the Atkins Tennis Center for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis. The men&#x27;s NCAA basketball team had a dream run in the 2005 season, with Bruce Weber&#x27;s Fighting Illini tying the record for most victories in a season. Their run ended 37–2 with a loss to the North Carolina Tar Heels in the national championship game. Illinois is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: Illinois Loyalty, the school song; Oskee Wow Wow, the fight song; and Hail to the Orange, the alma mater.

On October 15, 1910, the Illinois football team defeated the University of Chicago Maroons with a score of 3–0 in a game that Illinois claims was the first homecoming game, though several other schools claim to have held the first homecoming as well. On November 10, 2007, the unranked Illinois football team defeated the No. 1 ranked Ohio State football team in Ohio Stadium, the first time that the Illini beat a No. 1 ranked team on the road.

The University of Illinois Ice Arena is home to the university&#x27;s club college ice hockey team competing at the ACHA Division I level and is also available for recreational use through the Division of Campus Recreation. It was built in 1931 and designed by Chicago architecture firm Holabird and Root, the same firm that designed the University of Illinois Memorial Stadium and Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field. It is located on Armory Drive across from the Armory. The structure features four rows of bleacher seating in an elevated balcony that runs the length of the ice rink on either side. These bleachers provide seating for roughly 1,200 fans, with standing room and bench seating available underneath. Because of this set-up the team benches are actually directly underneath the stands.

In 2015, the university began Mandarin Chinese broadcasts of its American football games as a service to its Chinese international students.

===Mascot===

The University of Illinois currently has no mascot. Chief Illiniwek, also referred to as &quot;The Chief&quot;, was from 1926 to 2007 the official symbol of the University of Illinois in university intercollegiate athletic programs. The Chief was typically portrayed by a student dressed in Sioux regalia. Several groups protested that the use of a Native American figure and indigenous customs in such a manner was inappropriate and promoted ethnic stereotypes. In August 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association expressed disapproval of the university&#x27;s use of a &quot;hostile or abusive&quot; image. While initially proposing a consensus approach to the decision about the Chief, the board in 2007 decided that the Chief, its name, image and regalia should be officially retired. Nevertheless, the controversy continues on campus with some students unofficially maintaining the Chief. Complaints continue that indigenous students feel insulted when images of the Chief continue to be present on campus. The effort to resolve the controversy has included the work of a committee, which issued a report of its &quot;critical conversations&quot; that included over 600 participants representing all sides.

There is a grassroots campaign of students and alumni to officially recognize the belted kingfisher as the mascot of the University of Illinois. Female belted kingfishers are orange and blue (the school&#x27;s colors) and the bird is native to Illinois. A Kingfisher costume has been created and has made appearances on campus. The campaign to adopt the mascot is not seeking to change the name &quot;Fighting Illini.&quot; Multiple Indigenous organizations have also expressed support for the Kingfisher.

==Notable alumni and faculty==



Twenty-seven alumni and faculty members of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have won a Pulitzer Prize. , the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign alumni, faculty, and researchers include 24 Nobel laureates (including 11 alumni). In particular, John Bardeen is the only person to have won two Nobel prizes in physics, having done so in 1956 and 1972 while on faculty at the university. In 2003, two faculty members won Nobel prizes in different disciplines: Paul C. Lauterbur for physiology or medicine, and Anthony Leggett for physics.

Alumni and faculty have invented the LED and the quantum well laser (Nick Holonyak, B.S. 1950, M.S. 1951, Ph.D. 1954), DSL (John Cioffi, B.S. 1978), JavaScript (Brendan Eich, M.S. 1986), the integrated circuit (Jack Kilby, B.S. 1947), the transistor (John Bardeen, faculty, 1951–1991), the pH meter (Arnold Beckman, B.S. 1922, M.S. 1923), MRI (Paul C. Lauterbur), the plasma screen (Donald Bitzer, B.S. 1955, M.S. 1956, Ph.D. 1960), color plasma display (Larry F. Weber, B.S. 1968 M.S. 1971 Ph.D. 1975), the training methodology called PdEI and the coin counter (James P. Liautaud, B.S. 1963), the statistical algorithm called Gibbs sampling in computer vision and the machine learning technique called random forests (Donald Geman, B.A. 1965), and are responsible for the structural design of such buildings as the Willis Tower, the John Hancock Center, and the Burj Khalifa.

Mathematician Richard Hamming, known for the Hamming code and Hamming distance, earned a PhD in mathematics from the university&#x27;s Mathematics Department in 1942. Primetime Emmy Award-winning engineer Alan Bovik (B.S. 1980, M.S. 1982, Ph.D. 1984) invented neuroscience-based video quality measurement tools that pervade television, social media and home cinema. Structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan earned two master&#x27;s degrees, and a PhD in structural engineering from the university.

UIUC alumni and faculty have founded numerous companies and organizations. Notable founders include Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz (2009); Jerry Sanders, co-founder of AMD (1969); and Jerry Colangelo, founder of the Arizona Diamondbacks (1995). George Halas, who founded the Chicago Bears (1920) and co-founded the NFL, and Reshma Saujani, founder of Girls Who Code (2012), also made significant contributions. In technology, Marc Andreessen and Brendan Eich co-founded Mozilla Corporation and Netscape in the 1990s, while Larry Ellison and Bob Miner co-founded Oracle (1977). Other tech innovators include Nathan Gettings (Palantir Technologies, 2003), Luke Nosek and Max Levchin (PayPal, 1998), Martin Eberhard (Tesla, Inc., 2003), and Stephen Wolfram and Theodore Gray (Wolfram Research, 1987). Additionally, Hugh Hefner founded Playboy Enterprises (1953), Thomas Siebel co-founded Siebel Systems (1993), and Jerry Yue founded Brain Technologies, Inc. (2010). Other prominent companies like Yelp (2004) and YouTube (2005) were co-founded by Jeremy Stoppelman, Russel Simmons, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim. Alumni have also led several companies, including McDonald&#x27;s, Goldman Sachs, BP, Kodak, Shell, General Motors, AT&amp;T, and General Electric and others.

Alumni have founded many organizations, including the Susan G. Komen for the Cure and Project Gutenberg, and have served in a wide variety of government and public interest roles. Rafael Correa, President of The Republic of Ecuador from 2007 to 2017, secured his M.S. and PhD degrees from the university&#x27;s Economics Department in 1999 and 2001 respectively. Nathan C. Ricker attended U of I and in 1873 was the first person to graduate in the United States with a certificate in architecture. Mary L. Page, the first woman to obtain a degree in architecture, also graduated from U of I. Disability rights activist and co-organizer of the 504 Sit-in, Kitty Cone, attended during the 1960s, but left six hours short of her degree to continue her activism in New York.

In sports, baseball pitcher Ken Holtzman was a two-time All Star major leaguer, and threw two no-hitters in his career. In sports entertainment, David Otunga became a two-time WWE Tag Team Champion.

Eta Kappa Nu (ΗΚΝ) was founded at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as the national honor society for electrical engineering in 1904. Maurice LeRoy Carr (B.S. 1905) and Edmund B. Wheeler (B.S. 1905) were part of the founding group of ten students and they served as the first and second national presidents of ΗΚΝ. The Eta Kappa Nu organization is now the international honor society for IEEE as the IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu (IEEE-ΗΚΝ). The U of I collegiate chapter is known as the Alpha chapter of ΗΚΝ. Lowell P. Hager was the head of the Department of Biochemistry from 1969 until 1989 and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1995.

James Holzhauer, the third-highest-earning American game show contestant of all time and holder of several Jeopardy! records, attended University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He was a member of the Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering Team that won the state competition for the university, contributing by taking first place in physics and second in math. Holzhauer graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics in 2005.

<text>A minbar (; sometimes romanized as mimber) is a pulpit in a mosque where the imam (leader of prayers) stands to deliver sermons (, &quot;khutbah&quot;). It is also used in other similar contexts, such as in a Hussainiya where the speaker sits and lectures the congregation.

== Etymology ==
The word is a derivative of the Arabic root &quot;n-b-r&quot; (&quot;to raise, elevate&quot;); the Arabic plural is manābir ().

== Function and form ==
In Islam, the minbar is symbolically the seat of the imam who leads prayers in the mosque and delivers sermons. In the early years of Islam, this seat was reserved for the Islamic prophet Muhammad and later for the caliphs who followed him, each of whom was officially the imam of the whole Muslim community. It is important to note that the title &quot;Imam&quot; was officially adopted by Imam Ali alone (The fourth Muslim caliph). The first three rulers of Muslims after the Prophet used the title &quot;Caliph&quot; for themselves. It eventually became standard for all Friday mosques and was used by the local imam, but it retained its significance as a symbol of authority.

While minbars are roughly similar to church pulpits, they have a function and position more similar to that of a church lectern, being used instead by the imam for a wide range of readings and prayers. The minbar is located to the right of the &quot;mihrab&quot;, a niche in the far wall of the mosque that symbolizes the direction of prayer (i.e. towards Mecca). It is usually shaped like a small tower with a seat or kiosk-like structure at its top and a staircase leading up to it. The bottom of the staircase often has a doorway or portal. In contrast to many Christian pulpits, the steps up to the minbar are usually in a straight line on the same axis as the seat.

In some mosques, there is an elevated platform – in Arabic or in Turkish – opposite the minbar where the assistant of the imam, the muezzin, stands during prayer. The muezzin recites the answers to the prayers of the imam where applicable.

== Origins ==

The first recorded minbar in the Islamic world was Muhammad&#x27;s minbar in Medina, created in 629 CE (or between 628 and 631 CE). It consisted simply of two steps and a seat, resembling a throne. After Muhammad&#x27;s death, this minbar continued to be used as a symbol of authority by the caliphs who followed him. The Umayyad caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I () heightened Muhammad&#x27;s original minbar by increasing the number of steps from three to six, thus increasing its prominence. During the Umayyad period, the minbar was used by the caliphs or their representative governors to make important public announcements and to deliver the Friday sermon (&quot;khutba&quot;). In the last years of the Umayyad Caliphate, before its fall in 750, the Umayyads ordered minbars to be constructed for all the Friday mosques of Egypt and soon afterward this practice was extended to other Muslim territories. By the early Abbasid period (after 750), it had become standard in Friday mosques across all Muslim communities.

Minbars thus quickly developed into a symbol of political and religious legitimacy for Muslim authorities. It was one of the only major formal furnishings of a mosque and was therefore an important architectural feature in itself. More importantly, it was the setting for the weekly Friday sermon which, notably, usually mentioned the name of the current Muslim ruler over the community and included other public announcements of a religious or political nature. As a result, later Muslim rulers sometimes invested considerable expense in commissioning richly-decorated minbars for the main mosques of their major cities.

The oldest Islamic pulpit in the world to be preserved up to the present day is the minbar of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Kairouan, Tunisia. It dates from around 860 or 862 CE, under the tenure of the Aghlabid governor Abu Ibrahim Ahmad, and was imported in whole or in part from Baghdad. It is an eleven-step staircase made of over 300 sculpted pieces of teak wood (a material imported from India). Thanks to its age and the richness of its decoration, it is considered an important piece of historic Islamic art.

== Wood minbars ==

Woodwork was the primary medium for the construction of minbars in much of the Middle East and North Africa up until the Ottoman period. These wooden minbars were in many cases very intricately decorated with geometric patterns and carved arabesques (vegetal and floral motifs), as well as with Arabic calligraphic inscriptions (often recording the minbar&#x27;s creation or including Qur&#x27;anic verses). In some cases they also featured delicate inlay work with ivory or mother-of-pearl. Many workshops created minbars that were assembled from hundreds of pieces held together using an interlocking technique and wooden pegs, but without glue or metal nails.

=== Levant and Egypt ===

Some of the best-documented minbars are those produced in the Levant and Egypt from the 11th to 15th centuries. The oldest surviving example is the Minbar of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, commissioned in 1091 under the Fatimids, originally for a shrine in Ascalon. It features decoration in geometric strapwork motifs and Arabic inscriptions. Among the most famous minbars was the Minbar of the al-Aqsa Mosque (also known as the Minbar of Saladin) in Jerusalem, commissioned in 1168-69 by Nur ad-Din and signed by four different craftsmen. Prior to its destruction by arson in 1969, it was the most accomplished surviving example of Syrian craftsmanship in this woodworking tradition. Its sides were decorated with a tracery-like geometric pattern whose pieces were filled with carved arabesques. Its balustrades were made of turned wood assembled into a grille with more geometric designs, framed by Arabic inscriptions. Both the portal at the bottom and the kiosk-canopy at the top were crowned with &quot;muqarnas&quot;.
In Mamluk Egypt (13th–16th centuries), minbars were crafted following the earlier Syrian tradition. Their decoration is distinguished by the use of bone, ivory, ebony, or mother-of-pearl inlaid into the wood. The geometric patterning of the decoration is further elaborated, using multi-pointed stars whose lines are extended into a wider complex pattern, with arabesques carved inside the various polygons. The canopy at the summit of the minbar was usually topped by a bulbous finial similar to those at the top of minarets. Among the most notable examples is the minbar of the Mosque of Salih Tala&#x27;i, dated to 1300, which is also one of the earliest surviving minbars of this period. Another significant example is the minbar in the Mosque of Sultan al-Muayyad, from between 1415 and 1420. One of the finest minbars of the period is the Minbar of al-Ghamri (circa 1451), currently housed in the Khanqah of Sultan Barsbay. This minbar takes the design of decorative geometric patterns slightly further by using curved lines instead of the usual straight lines to form its polygons.

=== Maghreb ===
In the Maghreb, a number of wooden minbars have been preserved from the 10th to 15th centuries. The Great Mosque of Cordoba (in present-day Spain) hosted a famous minbar fabricated circa 975 on the orders of al-Hakam II. It has not survived to the present day, but it was probably emulated by the later minbars in the Maghreb that have been preserved.

Among the oldest surviving examples in the Maghreb, after the minbar of Kairouan, is the minbar of the Mosque of the Andalusians in Fez, which was originally constructed in 980 and is partly preserved today. Its original woodwork is carved with geometric motifs that appear inspired by those of the minbar in Kairouan. When the minbar was modified in 985, some panels were replaced with panels of turned wood using a bow-drill technique. This is one of the earliest examples of this woodworking technique, which later became common in the fabrication of &quot;mashrabiyya&quot;s (wooden screens and balconies).

The next oldest Maghrebi minbar to survive is that of the Great Mosque of Nedroma, dated to around 1086, but only some fragments of its original structure remain. The minbar of the Great Mosque of Algiers, dated to around 1097, is more substantially preserved and resembles the presumed form of the Cordoba minbar. Its sides are decorated with square panels of vegetal and sometimes geometric motifs.
The most important surviving minbar of this artistic tradition is the Almoravid minbar in Marrakesh, commissioned in 1137 by Ali ibn Yusuf and completed around 1145. During the Almohad period later that century, it was moved to the Kutubiyya Mosque in the same city. It is housed today in the Badi Palace Museum. The richly-crafted minbar was fabricated in Cordoba and may thus provide some hint of the former style and craftsmanship of the Cordoba minbar, in addition to its other structural similarities. The decoration of this minbar, however, is more extravagant and sophisticated than any other surviving examples. It combines geometric and arabesque motifs executed in a mix of marquetry, inlay, and wood carving.

The only other minbar approaching, but not quite matching, the quality of the Almoravid minbar in Marrakesh is the minbar of the Qarawiyyin Mosque, also commissioned by Ali ibn Yusuf and completed in 1144. The other notable minbars produced after this, mostly found in present-day Morocco, generally imitate the style of the earlier Almoravid minbar. These later minbars include the minbar of the Kasbah Mosque in Marrakesh (circa 1189–1195), the minbar of the Mosque of the Andalusians following its Almohad renovation (circa 1203–1209), the minbar of the Great Mosque of Fes el-Jdid (circa 1276), the minbar of the Great Mosque of Taza (circa 1290–1300), and the minbar of the Bou Inania Madrasa in Fez (between 1350 and 1355). Even the much later minbar of the Mouassine Mosque in Marrakesh (between 1562 and 1573) continues to show imitations of the same tradition.

=== Iran ===
Iranian minbars typically have no canopy or dome at the top, distinguishing them from minbars in other regions. In Iran, Mesopotomia, and Anatolia, some wooden minbars preserved from the 11th and 12th centuries are carved with vegetal beveled-style motifs. Most other early minbars in Iran and Afghanistan were destroyed during the Mongol invasions of the 13th century.

The most significant minbars preserved from the Ilkhanid period (13th–14th centuries) include those in the Great Mosque of Na&#x27;in (1311) and in the prayer hall added by Uljaytu to the Great Mosque of Isfahan. Both are wooden structures, with the former&#x27;s flanks decorated by rectangular panels with beveled motifs and the latter&#x27;s flanks decorated by octagonal geometric motifs. The minbar in Na&#x27;in is also one of the few Iranian minbars topped by a canopy.

From the subsequent Timurid period, the most important example is the minbar of the Mosque of Gowhar Shad in Mashhad, fabricated between 1336 and 1446. It shares the overall form of the minbar in Na&#x27;in and, like the latter, it also stands apart from other Iranian minbars in having a canopy. Its decoration is distinguished by a carpet-like geometric pattern filled with carvings of tendrils.

== Stone minbars ==
In the central Islamic lands, stone or marble minbars were occasionally produced at an early period, as with some examples in Mamluk Cairo, but they are generally characteristic of the later Ottoman period. Compared to the earlier traditions of wooden minbars, stone minbars were often simpler in their decoration.

=== Mamluk period ===
One of the few early marble minbars of Mamluk Cairo is found in the Aqsunqur Mosque in Cairo (circa 1347). Its marble surfaces are decorated with other stone materials of different colors inside an interlacing pattern formed by bands of marble. A marble minbar was also constructed for the earlier Mosque of Ulmas al-Hajib (1329–1330). Only fragments of it have been preserved (kept at the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo), but they attest to some of the highest-quality stonework from the Mamluk period. The stone minbar of the Mosque of Sultan Hasan in Cairo (circa 1360) is relatively plain, though it has unusually ornate bronze doors. In the next century, Sultan Qaytbay gifted a stone minbar to the Khanqah of Faraj ibn Barquq in 1483. This one is covered with geometric motifs carved to resemble the traditional style of wooden minbars.

=== Ottoman period ===

Ottoman minbars are distinguished in part by the shape of their canopy, where the traditional small dome is replaced with a tall, polygonal cone similar to the caps of Ottoman minarets. An exceptional early minbar is that of the Ahmed Pasha Mosque in Amasya, which has extensive finely-carved floral decoration. In the finest Ottoman minbars, the main flanks are pierced with geometric openwork and arcades. The apogee of this style is exemplified by the minbar of the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne (circa 1574). The conical cap of this minbar is also covered with decorative tiles, a feature shared with the slightly earlier minbar of the Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque. In later centuries, following the introduction of the Ottoman Baroque style, minbars were carved with eclectic motifs inspired by the European Baroque.

=== Indian subcontinent ===

Minbars were highly variable in style and size on the Indian subcontinent, but stone was the favoured material throughout the region. Wooden minbars may have been employed in earlier periods, but few or none have been preserved. Some of the minbars are merely a series of simple steps while others are very elaborate.

Among other variations, the minbars of the Bengal Sultanate and the Gujarat Sultanate typically have canopies, while those of the Jaunpur Sultanate and Mughal Empire usually do not. One of the most elegant examples of the canopied type is the minbar in the Friday Mosque of Mandu in the Malwa region, dated to 1454, which has a dome in the local style upheld by curving brackets. In both the Gujarat and Malwa regions, the first step of the minbar is often preceded by a small square platform whose original purpose is unclear.
In the Deccan, the minbar is usually a plain staircase of three steps. In the Mughal Empire, some minbars also had a simple design form with three steps, but they sometimes had flourishes such as a highly-polished or inlaid marble finish (especially under Shah Jahan) or a pierced stone balustrade.

<text>A fountain, from the Latin &quot;fons&quot; (genitive &quot;fontis&quot;), meaning source or spring, is a decorative reservoir used for discharging water. It is also a structure that jets water into the air for a decorative or dramatic effect.

Fountains were originally purely functional, connected to springs or aqueducts and used to provide drinking water and water for bathing and washing to the residents of cities, towns and villages. Until the late 19th century most fountains operated by gravity, and needed a source of water higher than the fountain, such as a reservoir or aqueduct, to make the water flow or jet into the air.

In addition to providing drinking water, fountains were used for decoration and to celebrate their builders. Roman fountains were decorated with bronze or stone masks of animals or heroes. In the Middle Ages, Moorish and Muslim garden designers used fountains to create miniature versions of the gardens of paradise. King Louis XIV of France used fountains in the Gardens of Versailles to illustrate his power over nature. The baroque decorative fountains of Rome in the 17th and 18th centuries marked the arrival point of restored Roman aqueducts and glorified the Popes who built them.

By the end of the 19th century, as indoor plumbing became the main source of drinking water, urban fountains became purely decorative. Mechanical pumps replaced gravity and allowed fountains to recycle water and to force it high into the air. The Jet d&#x27;Eau in Lake Geneva, built in 1951, shoots water in the air. The highest such fountain in the world is King Fahd&#x27;s Fountain in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which spouts water above the Red Sea.

Fountains are used today to decorate city parks and squares; to honor individuals or events; for recreation and for entertainment. A splash pad or spray pool allows city residents to enter, get wet and cool off in summer. The musical fountain combines moving jets of water, colored lights and recorded music, controlled by a computer, for dramatic effects. Fountains can themselves also be musical instruments played by obstruction of one or more of their water jets.
Drinking fountains provide clean drinking water in public buildings, parks and public spaces.

==History==
===Ancient fountains===

Ancient civilizations built stone basins to capture and hold precious drinking water. A carved stone basin, dating to around 700 BC, was discovered in the ruins of the ancient Sumerian city of Lagash in modern Iraq. The ancient Assyrians constructed a series of basins in the gorge of the Comel River, carved in solid rock, connected by small channels, descending to a stream. The lowest basin was decorated with carved reliefs of two lions. The ancient Egyptians had ingenious systems for hoisting water up from the Nile for drinking and irrigation, but without a higher source of water it was not possible to make water flow by gravity, There are lion-shaped fountains in the Temple of Dendera in Qena.

The ancient Greeks used aqueducts and gravity-powered fountains to distribute water. According to ancient historians, fountains existed in Athens, Corinth, and other ancient Greek cities in the 6th century BC as the terminating points of aqueducts which brought water from springs and rivers into the cities. In the 6th century BC, the Athenian ruler Peisistratos built the main fountain of Athens, the &quot;Enneacrounos&quot;, in the Agora, or main square. It had nine large cannons, or spouts, which supplied drinking water to local residents.

Greek fountains were made of stone or marble, with water flowing through bronze pipes and emerging from the mouth of a sculpted mask that represented the head of a lion or the muzzle of an animal. Most Greek fountains flowed by simple gravity, but they also discovered how to use principle of a siphon to make water spout, as seen in pictures on Greek vases.

===Ancient Roman fountains===
The Ancient Romans built an extensive system of aqueducts from mountain rivers and lakes to provide water for the fountains and baths of Rome. The Roman engineers used lead pipes instead of bronze to distribute the water throughout the city. The excavations at Pompeii, which revealed the city as it was when it was destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, uncovered free-standing fountains and basins placed at intervals along city streets, fed by siphoning water upwards from lead pipes under the street. The excavations of Pompeii also showed that the homes of wealthy Romans often had a small fountain in the atrium, or interior courtyard, with water coming from the city water supply and spouting into a small bowl or basin.

Ancient Rome was a city of fountains. According to Sextus Julius Frontinus, the Roman consul who was named &quot;curator aquarum&quot; or guardian of the water of Rome in 98 AD, Rome had nine aqueducts which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.

The Romans were able to make fountains jet water into the air, by using the pressure of water flowing from a distant and higher source of water to create hydraulic head, or force. Illustrations of fountains in gardens spouting water are found on wall paintings in Rome from the 1st century BC, and in the villas of Pompeii. The Villa of Hadrian in Tivoli featured a large swimming basin with jets of water. Pliny the Younger described the banquet room of a Roman villa where a fountain began to jet water when visitors sat on a marble seat. The water flowed into a basin, where the courses of a banquet were served in floating dishes shaped like boats.

Roman engineers built aqueducts and fountains throughout the Roman Empire. Examples can be found today in the ruins of Roman towns in Vaison-la-Romaine and Glanum in France, in Augst, Switzerland, and other sites.

===Medieval fountains===
In Nepal there were public drinking fountains at least as early as 550 AD. They are called &quot;dhunge dharas&quot; or &quot;hitis&quot;. They consist of intricately carved stone spouts through which water flows uninterrupted from underground water sources. They are found extensively in Nepal and some of them are still operational. Construction of water conduits like hitis and dug wells are considered as pious acts in Nepal.

During the Middle Ages, Roman aqueducts were wrecked or fell into decay, and many fountains throughout Europe stopped working, so fountains existed mainly in art and literature, or in secluded monasteries or palace gardens. Fountains in the Middle Ages were associated with the source of life, purity, wisdom, innocence, and the Garden of Eden. In illuminated manuscripts like the &quot;Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot; (1411–1416), the Garden of Eden was shown with a graceful gothic fountain in the center (see illustration). The Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck, finished in 1432, also shows a fountain as a feature of the adoration of the mystic lamb, a scene apparently set in Paradise.

The cloister of a monastery was supposed to be a replica of the Garden of Eden, protected from the outside world. Simple fountains, called lavabos, were placed inside Medieval monasteries such as Le Thoronet Abbey in Provence and were used for ritual washing before religious services.

Fountains were also found in the enclosed medieval &quot;jardins d&#x27;amour&quot;, &quot;gardens of courtly love&quot; – ornamental gardens used for courtship and relaxation. The medieval romance The &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot; describes a fountain in the center of an enclosed garden, feeding small streams bordered by flowers and fresh herbs.

Some Medieval fountains, like the cathedrals of their time, illustrated biblical stories, local history and the virtues of their time. The Fontana Maggiore in Perugia, dedicated in 1278, is decorated with stone carvings representing prophets and saints, allegories of the arts, labors of the months, the signs of the zodiac, and scenes from Genesis and Roman history.

Medieval fountains could also provide amusement. The gardens of the Counts of Artois at the Château de Hesdin, built in 1295, contained famous fountains, called &quot;Les Merveilles de Hesdin&quot; (&quot;The Wonders of Hesdin&quot;) which could be triggered to drench surprised visitors.

===Fountains of the Islamic world===


Shortly after the spread of Islam, the Arabs incorporated into their city planning the famous Islamic gardens. Islamic gardens after the 7th century were traditionally enclosed by walls and were designed to represent paradise. The paradise gardens, were laid out in the form of a cross, with four channels representing the rivers of Paradise, dividing the four parts of the world. Water sometimes spouted from a fountain in the center of the cross, representing the spring or fountain, Salsabil, described in the Qur&#x27;an as the source of the rivers of Paradise.

In the 9th century, the Banū Mūsā brothers, a trio of Persian Inventors, were commissioned by the Caliph of Baghdad to summarize the engineering knowledge of the ancient Greek and Roman world. They wrote a book entitled the &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;, describing the works of the 1st century Greek Engineer Hero of Alexandria and other engineers, plus many of their own inventions. They described fountains which formed water into different shapes and a wind-powered water pump, but it is not known if any of their fountains were ever actually built.

The Persian rulers of the Middle Ages had elaborate water distribution systems and fountains in their palaces and gardens. Water was carried by a pipe into the palace from a source at a higher elevation. Once inside the palace or garden it came up through a small hole in a marble or stone ornament and poured into a basin or garden channels. The gardens of Pasargades had a system of canals which flowed from basin to basin, both watering the garden and making a pleasant sound. The Persian engineers also used the principle of the syphon (called &quot;shotor-gelu&quot; in Persian, literally &#x27;neck of the camel) to create fountains which spouted water or made it resemble a bubbling spring. The garden of Fin, near Kashan, used 171 spouts connected to pipes to create a fountain called the &quot;Howz-e jush&quot;, or &quot;boiling basin&quot;.

The 11th century Persian poet Azraqi described a Persian fountain:

:From a marvelous faucet of gold pours a wave
:whose clarity is more pure than a soul;
:The turquoise and silver form ribbons in the basin
:coming from this faucet of gold ...

Reciprocating motion was first described in 1206 by Arab Muslim engineer and inventor al-Jazari when the kings of the Artuqid dynasty in Turkey commissioned him to manufacture a machine to raise water for their palaces. The finest result was a machine called the double-acting reciprocating piston pump, which translated rotary motion to reciprocating motion via the crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism.


The palaces of Moorish Spain, particularly the Alhambra in Granada, had famous fountains. The patio of the Sultan in the gardens of Generalife in Granada (1319) featured spouts of water pouring into a basin, with channels which irrigated orange and myrtle trees. The garden was modified over the centuries – the jets of water which cross the canal today were added in the 19th century.

The fountain in the Court of the Lions of the Alhambra, built from 1362 to 1391, is a large vasque mounted on twelve stone statues of lions. Water spouts upward in the vasque and pours from the mouths of the lions, filling four channels dividing the courtyard into quadrants. The basin dates to the 14th century, but the lions spouting water are believed to be older, dating to the 11th century.

The design of the Islamic garden spread throughout the Islamic world, from Moorish Spain to the Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent. The Shalimar Gardens built by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1641, were said to be ornamented with 410 fountains, which fed into a large basin, canal and marble pools.

In the Ottoman Empire, rulers often built fountains next to mosques so worshippers could do their ritual washing. Examples include the Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), Temple Mount, Jerusalem, an ablution and drinking fountain built during the Ottoman reign of Suleiman the Magnificent; the Fountain of Ahmed III (1728) at the Topkapı Palace, Istanbul, another Fountain of Ahmed III in Üsküdar (1729) and Tophane Fountain (1732). Palaces themselves often had small decorated fountains, which provided drinking water, cooled the air, and made a pleasant splashing sound. One surviving example is the Fountain of Tears (1764) at the Bakhchisarai Palace, in Crimea; which was made famous by a poem of Alexander Pushkin.
The sebil was a decorated fountain that was often the only source of water for the surrounding neighborhood.
It was often commissioned as an act of Islamic piety by a rich person.

===Renaissance fountains (15th–17th centuries)===


In the 14th century, Italian humanist scholars began to rediscover and translate forgotten Roman texts on architecture by Vitruvius, on hydraulics by Hero of Alexandria, and descriptions of Roman gardens and fountains by Pliny the Younger, Pliny the Elder, and Varro. The treatise on architecture, &quot;De re aedificatoria&quot;, by Leon Battista Alberti, which described in detail Roman villas, gardens and fountains, became the guidebook for Renaissance builders.

In Rome, Pope Nicholas V (1397–1455), himself a scholar who commissioned hundreds of translations of ancient Greek classics into Latin, decided to embellish the city and make it a worthy capital of the Christian world. In 1453, he began to rebuild the Acqua Vergine, the ruined Roman aqueduct which had brought clean drinking water to the city from eight miles (13 km) away. He also decided to revive the Roman custom of marking the arrival point of an aqueduct with a &quot;mostra&quot;, a grand commemorative fountain. He commissioned the architect Leon Battista Alberti to build a wall fountain where the Trevi Fountain is now located. The aqueduct he restored, with modifications and extensions, eventually supplied water to the Trevi Fountain and the famous baroque fountains in the Piazza del Popolo and Piazza Navona.

One of the first new fountains to be built in Rome during the Renaissance was the fountain in the piazza in front of the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1472), which was placed on the site of an earlier Roman fountain. Its design, based on an earlier Roman model, with a circular vasque on a pedestal pouring water into a basin below, became the model for many other fountains in Rome, and eventually for fountains in other cities, from Paris to London.

In 1503, Pope Julius II decided to recreate a classical pleasure garden in the same place. The new garden, called the Cortile del Belvedere, was designed by Donato Bramante. The garden was decorated with the Pope&#x27;s famous collection of classical statues, and with fountains. The Venetian Ambassador wrote in 1523, &quot;... On one side of the garden is a most beautiful loggia, at one end of which is a lovely fountain that irrigates the orange trees and the rest of the garden by a little canal in the center of the loggia ... The original garden was split in two by the construction of the Vatican Library in the 16th century, but a new fountain by Carlo Maderno was built in the Cortile del Belvedere, with a jet of water shooting up from a circular stone bowl on an octagonal pedestal in a large basin.

In 1537, in Florence, Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, who had become ruler of the city at the age of only 17, also decided to launch a program of aqueduct and fountain building. The city had previously gotten all its drinking water from wells and reservoirs of rain water, which meant that there was little water or water pressure to run fountains. Cosimo built an aqueduct large enough for the first continually-running fountain in Florence, the Fountain of Neptune in the Piazza della Signoria (1560–1567). This fountain featured an enormous white marble statue of Neptune, resembling Cosimo, by sculptor Bartolomeo Ammannati.

Under the Medicis, fountains were not just sources of water, but advertisements of the power and benevolence of the city&#x27;s rulers. They became central elements not only of city squares, but of the new Italian Renaissance garden. The great Medici Villa at Castello, built for Cosimo by Benedetto Varchi, featured two monumental fountains on its central axis; one showing with two bronze figures representing Hercules slaying Antaeus, symbolizing the victory of Cosimo over his enemies; and a second fountain, in the middle of a circular labyrinth of cypresses, laurel, myrtle and roses, had a bronze statue by Giambologna which showed the goddess Venus wringing her hair. The planet Venus was governed by Capricorn, which was the emblem of Cosimo; the fountain symbolized that he was the absolute master of Florence.

By the middle Renaissance, fountains had become a form of theater, with cascades and jets of water coming from marble statues of animals and mythological figures. The most famous fountains of this kind were found in the Villa d&#x27;Este (1550–1572), at Tivoli near Rome, which featured a hillside of basins, fountains and jets of water, as well as a fountain which produced music by pouring water into a chamber, forcing air into a series of flute-like pipes. The gardens also featured &quot;giochi d&#x27;acqua&quot;, water jokes, hidden fountains which suddenly soaked visitors.
Between 1546 and 1549, the merchants of Paris built the first Renaissance-style fountain in Paris, the Fontaine des Innocents, to commemorate the ceremonial entry of the King into the city. The fountain, which originally stood against the wall of the church of the Holy Innocents, as rebuilt several times and now stands in a square near Les Halles. It is the oldest fountain in Paris.

Henry constructed an Italian-style garden with a fountain shooting a vertical jet of water for his favorite mistress, Diane de Poitiers, next to the Château de Chenonceau (1556–1559). At the royal Château de Fontainebleau, he built another fountain with a bronze statue of Diane, goddess of the hunt, modeled after Diane de Poitiers.

Later, after the death of Henry II, his widow, Catherine de Medici, expelled Diane de Poitiers from Chenonceau and built her own fountain and garden there.

King Henry IV of France made an important contribution to French fountains by inviting an Italian hydraulic engineer, Tommaso Francini, who had worked on the fountains of the villa at Pratalino, to make fountains in France. Francini became a French citizen in 1600, built the Medici Fountain, and during the rule of the young King Louis XIII, he was raised to the position of Intendant général des Eaux et Fontaines of the king, a position which was hereditary. His descendants became the royal fountain designers for Louis XIII and for Louis XIV at Versailles.

In 1630, another Medici, Marie de Medici, the widow of Henry IV, built her own monumental fountain in Paris, the Medici Fountain, in the garden of the Palais du Luxembourg. That fountain still exists today, with a long basin of water and statues added in 1866.

===Baroque fountains (17th–18th century)===

====Baroque Fountains of Rome====
The 17th and 18th centuries were a golden age for fountains in Rome, which began with the reconstruction of ruined Roman aqueducts and the construction by the Popes of &quot;mostra&quot;, or display fountains, to mark their termini. The new fountains were expressions of the new Baroque art, which was officially promoted by the Catholic Church as a way to win popular support against the Protestant Reformation; the Council of Trent had declared in the 16th century that the Church should counter austere Protestantism with art that was lavish, animated and emotional. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of Rubens, were examples of the principles of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were &quot;a visual representation of confidence and power.&quot;

The first of the Fountains of St. Peter&#x27;s Square, by Carlo Maderno, (1614) was one of the earliest Baroque fountains in Rome, made to complement the lavish Baroque façade he designed for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica behind it. It was fed by water from the Paola aqueduct, restored in 1612, whose source was above sea level, which meant it could shoot water twenty feet up from the fountain. Its form, with a large circular vasque on a pedestal pouring water into a basin and an inverted vasque above it spouting water, was imitated two centuries later in the Fountains of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.

The Triton Fountain in the Piazza Barberini (1642), by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, is a masterpiece of Baroque sculpture, representing Triton, half-man and half-fish, blowing his horn to calm the waters, following a text by the Roman poet Ovid in the Metamorphoses. The Triton fountain benefited from its location in a valley, and the fact that it was fed by the Aqua Felice aqueduct, restored in 1587, which arrived in Rome at an elevation of above sea level (fasl), a difference of in elevation between the source and the fountain, which meant that the water from this fountain jetted sixteen feet straight up into the air from the conch shell of the triton.

The Piazza Navona became a grand theater of water, with three fountains, built in a line on the site of the Stadium of Domitian. The fountains at either end are by Giacomo della Porta; the Neptune fountain to the north, (1572) shows the God of the Sea spearing an octopus, surrounded by tritons, sea horses and mermaids. At the southern end is Il Moro, possibly also a figure of Neptune riding a fish in a conch shell. In the center is the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, (The Fountain of the Four Rivers) (1648–51), a highly theatrical fountain by Bernini, with statues representing rivers from the four continents; the Nile, Danube, Plate River and Ganges. Over the whole structure is a Egyptian obelisk, crowned by a cross with the emblem of the Pamphili family, representing Pope Innocent X, whose family palace was on the piazza. The theme of a fountain with statues symbolizing great rivers was later used in the Place de la Concorde (1836–40) and in the Fountain of Neptune in the Alexanderplatz in Berlin (1891). The fountains of Piazza Navona had one drawback - their water came from the Acqua Vergine, which had only a drop from the source to the fountains, which meant the water could only fall or trickle downwards, not jet very high upwards.

The Trevi Fountain is the largest and most spectacular of Rome&#x27;s fountains, designed to glorify the three different Popes who created it. It was built beginning in 1730 at the terminus of the reconstructed Acqua Vergine aqueduct, on the site of Renaissance fountain by Leon Battista Alberti. It was the work of architect Nicola Salvi and the successive project of Pope Clement XII, Pope Benedict XIV and Pope Clement XIII, whose emblems and inscriptions are carried on the attic story, entablature and central niche. The central figure is Oceanus, the personification of all the seas and oceans, in an oyster-shell chariot, surrounded by Tritons and Sea Nymphs.

In fact, the fountain had very little water pressure, because the source of water was, like the source for the Piazza Navona fountains, the Acqua Vergine, with a drop. Salvi compensated for this problem by sinking the fountain down into the ground, and by carefully designing the cascade so that the water churned and tumbled, to add movement and drama. Wrote historians Maria Ann Conelli and Marilyn Symmes, &quot;On many levels the Trevi altered the appearance, function and intent of fountains and was a watershed for future designs.&quot;

====Baroque fountains of Versailles====
Beginning in 1662, King Louis XIV of France began to build a new kind of garden, the Garden à la française, or French formal garden, at the Palace of Versailles. In this garden, the fountain played a central role. He used fountains to demonstrate the power of man over nature, and to illustrate the grandeur of his rule. In the Gardens of Versailles, instead of falling naturally into a basin, water was shot into the sky, or formed into the shape of a fan or bouquet. Dancing water was combined with music and fireworks to form a grand spectacle. These fountains were the work of the descendants of Tommaso Francini, the Italian hydraulic engineer who had come to France during the time of Henry IV and built the Medici Fountain and the Fountain of Diana at Fontainebleau.

Two fountains were the centerpieces of the Gardens of Versailles, both taken from the myths about Apollo, the sun god, the emblem of Louis XIV, and both symbolizing his power. The Fontaine Latone (1668–70) designed by André Le Nôtre and sculpted by Gaspard and Balthazar Marsy, represents the story of how the peasants of Lycia tormented Latona and her children, Diana and Apollo, and were punished by being turned into frogs. This was a reminder of how French peasants had abused Louis&#x27;s mother, Anne of Austria, during the uprising called the Fronde in the 1650s. When the fountain is turned on, sprays of water pour down on the peasants, who are frenzied as they are transformed into creatures.

The other centerpiece of the Gardens, at the intersection of the main axes of the Gardens of Versailles, is the Bassin d&#x27;Apollon (1668–71), designed by Charles Le Brun and sculpted by Jean Baptiste Tuby. This statue shows a theme also depicted in the painted decoration in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles: Apollo in his chariot about to rise from the water, announced by Tritons with seashell trumpets. Historians Mary Anne Conelli and Marilyn Symmes wrote, &quot;Designed for dramatic effect and to flatter the king, the fountain is oriented so that the Sun God rises from the west and travels east toward the chateau, in contradiction to nature.&quot;

Besides these two monumental fountains, the Gardens over the years contained dozens of other fountains, including thirty-nine animal fountains in the labyrinth depicting the fables of Jean de La Fontaine.

There were so many fountains at Versailles that it was impossible to have them all running at once; when Louis XIV made his promenades, his fountain-tenders turned on the fountains ahead of him and turned off those behind him. Louis built an enormous pumping station, the Machine de Marly, with fourteen water wheels and 253 pumps to raise the water three hundred feet from the River Seine, and even attempted to divert the River Eure to provide water for his fountains, but the water supply was never enough.

====Baroque fountains of Peterhof====
In Russia, Peter the Great founded a new capital at St. Petersburg in 1703 and built a small Summer Palace and gardens there beside the Neva River. The gardens featured a fountain of two sea monsters spouting water, among the earliest fountains in Russia.

In 1709, he began constructing a larger palace, Peterhof Palace, alongside the Gulf of Finland, Peter visited France in 1717 and saw the gardens and fountains of Louis XIV at Versailles, Marly and Fontainebleau. When he returned he began building a vast Garden à la française with fountains at Peterhof. The central feature of the garden was a water cascade, modeled after the cascade at the Château de Marly of Louis XIV, built in 1684. The gardens included trick fountains designed to drench unsuspecting visitors, a popular feature of the Italian Renaissance garden.,

In 1800–1802 the Emperor Paul I of Russia and his successor, Alexander I of Russia, built a new fountain at the foot of the cascade depicting Samson prying open the mouth of a lion, representing Peter&#x27;s victory over Sweden in the Great Northern War in 1721. The fountains were fed by reservoirs in the upper garden, while the Samson fountain was fed by a specially-constructed aqueduct four kilometers in length.
===19th century fountains===
In the early 19th century, London and Paris built aqueducts and new fountains to supply clean drinking water to their exploding populations. Napoleon Bonaparte started construction on the first canals bringing drinking water to Paris, fifteen new fountains, the most famous being the Fontaine du Palmier in the Place du Châtelet, (1896–1808), celebrating his military victories.

He also restored and put back into service some of the city&#x27;s oldest fountains, such as the Medici Fountain. Two of Napoleon&#x27;s fountains, the Chateau d&#x27;Eau and the fountain in the Place des Vosges, were the first purely decorative fountains in Paris, without water taps for drinking water.

Louis-Philippe (1830–1848) continued Napoleon&#x27;s work, and added some of Paris&#x27;s most famous fountains, notably the Fontaines de la Concorde (1836–1840) and the fountains in the Place des Vosges.

Following a deadly cholera epidemic in 1849, Louis Napoleon decided to completely rebuild the Paris water supply system, separating the water supply for fountains from the water supply for drinking. The most famous fountain built by Louis Napoleon was the Fontaine Saint-Michel, part of his grand reconstruction of Paris boulevards. Louis Napoleon relocated and rebuilt several earlier fountains, such as the Medici Fountain and the Fontaine de Leda, when their original sites were destroyed by his construction projects.

In the mid-nineteenth century the first fountains were built in the United States, connected to the first aqueducts bringing drinking water from outside the city. The first fountain in Philadelphia, at Centre Square, opened in 1809, and featured a statue by sculptor William Rush. The first fountain in New York City, in City Hall Park, opened in 1842, and the first fountain in Boston was turned on in 1848. The first famous American decorative fountain was the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park in New York City, opened in 1873.

The 19th century also saw the introduction of new materials in fountain construction; cast iron (the Fontaines de la Concorde); glass (the Crystal Fountain in London (1851)) and even aluminium (the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus, London, (1897)).

The invention of steam pumps meant that water could be supplied directly to homes, and pumped upward from fountains. The new fountains in Trafalgar Square (1845) used steam pumps from an artesian well. By the end of the 19th century fountains in big cities were no longer used to supply drinking water, and were simply a form of art and urban decoration.

Another fountain innovation of the 19th century was the illuminated fountain: The Bartholdi Fountain at the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876 was illuminated by gas lamps. In 1884 a fountain in Britain featured electric lights shining upward through the water. The Exposition Universelle (1889) which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution featured a fountain illuminated by electric lights shining up though the columns of water. The fountains, located in a basin forty meters in diameter, were given color by plates of colored glass inserted over the lamps. The Fountain of Progress gave its show three times each evening, for twenty minutes, with a series of different colors.

===20th century fountains===
Paris fountains in the 20th century no longer had to supply drinking water - they were purely decorative; and, since their water usually came from the river and not from the city aqueducts, their water was no longer drinkable. Twenty-eight new fountains were built in Paris between 1900 and 1940; nine new fountains between 1900 and 1910; four between 1920 and 1930; and fifteen between 1930 and 1940.

The biggest fountains of the period were those built for the International Expositions of 1900, 1925 and 1937, and for the Colonial Exposition of 1931. Of those, only the fountains from the 1937 exposition at the Palais de Chaillot still exist. (See Fountains of International Expositions).

Only a handful of fountains were built in Paris between 1940 and 1980. The most important ones built during that period were on the edges of the city, on the west, just outside the city limits, at La Défense, and to the east at the Bois de Vincennes.

Between 1981 and 1995, during the terms of President François Mitterrand and Culture Minister Jack Lang, and of Mitterrand&#x27;s bitter political rival, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac (Mayor from 1977 until 1995), the city experienced a program of monumental fountain building that exceeded that of Napoleon Bonaparte or Louis Philippe. More than one hundred fountains were built in Paris in the 1980s, mostly in the neighborhoods outside the center of Paris, where there had been few fountains before These included the Fontaine Cristaux, homage to Béla Bartók by Jean-Yves Lechevallier (1980); the Stravinsky Fountain next to the Pompidou Center, by sculptors Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely (1983); the fountain of the Pyramid of the Louvre by I.M. Pei, (1989), the Buren Fountain by sculptor Daniel Buren, Les Sphérades fountain, both in the Palais-Royal, and the fountains of Parc André-Citroën. The Mitterrand-Chirac fountains had no single style or theme. Many of the fountains were designed by famous sculptors or architects, such as Jean Tinguely, I.M. Pei, Claes Oldenburg and Daniel Buren, who had radically different ideas of what a fountain should be. Some were solemn, and others were whimsical. Most made little effort to blend with their surroundings - they were designed to attract attention.

Fountains built in the United States between 1900 and 1950 mostly followed European models and classical styles. The Samuel Francis Dupont Memorial Fountain was designed and created by Henry Bacon and Daniel Chester French, the architect and sculptor of the Lincoln Memorial, in 1921, in a pure neoclassical style.

&quot;Buckingham Fountain&quot; in Chicago was one of the first American fountains to use powerful modern pumps to shoot water as high as into the air.
The &quot;Fountain of Prometheus,&quot; built at the Rockefeller Center in 1933, was the first American fountain in the Art-Deco style.

After World War II, fountains in the United States became more varied in form. Some, like Ruth Asawa&#x27;s &quot;Andrea&quot; (1968) and &quot;Vaillancourt Fountain&quot; (1971), both located in San Francisco, were pure works of sculpture. Other fountains, like the &quot;Frankin Roosevelt Memorial Waterfall&quot; (1997), by architect Lawrence Halprin, were designed as landscapes to illustrate themes. This fountain is part of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington D.C., which has four outdoor &quot;rooms&quot; illustrating his presidency. Each &quot;room&quot; contains a cascade or waterfall; the cascade in the third room illustrates the turbulence of the years of the World War II. Halprin wrote at an early stage of the design; &quot;the whole environment of the memorial becomes sculpture: to touch, feel, hear and contact - with all the senses.&quot;

The end of the 20th century the development of high-shooting fountains, beginning with the Jet d&#x27;eau in Geneva in 1951, and followed by taller and taller fountains in the United States and the Middle East. The highest fountain today is &quot;King Fahd&#x27;s Fountain&quot; in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

It also saw the increasing popularity of the musical fountain, which combined water, music and light, choreographed by computers. (See Musical fountain below).

=== Contemporary fountains (2001–present) ===
The fountain called &#x27;Bit.Fall&#x27; by German artist Julius Popp (2005) uses digital technologies to spell out words with water. The fountain is run by a statistical program which selects words at random from news stories on the Internet. It then recodes these words into pictures. Then 320 nozzles inject the water into electromagnetic valves. The program uses rasterization and bitmap technologies to synchronize the valves so drops of water form an image of the words as they fall. According to Popp, the sheet of water is &quot;a metaphor for the constant flow of information from which we cannot escape.&quot;

&quot;Crown Fountain&quot; is an interactive fountain and video sculpture feature in Chicago&#x27;s Millennium Park. Designed by Catalan artist Jaume Plensa, it opened in July 2004. The fountain is composed of a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of glass brick towers. The towers are tall, and they use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to display digital videos on their inward faces. Construction and design of &quot;Crown Fountain&quot; cost US$17 million. Weather permitting, the water operates from May to October, intermittently cascading down the two towers and spouting through a nozzle on each tower&#x27;s front face.

Few new fountains have been built in Paris since 2000. The most notable is La Danse de la fontaine emergente (2008), located on Place Augusta-Holmes, rue Paul Klee, in the 13th arrondissement. It was designed by the French-Chinese sculptor Chen Zhen (1955-2000), shortly before his death in 2000, and finished through the efforts of his spouse and collaborator. It shows a dragon, in stainless steel, glass and plastic, emerging and submerging from the pavement of the square. The fountain is in three parts. A bas-relief of the dragon is fixed on the wall of the structure of the water-supply plant, and the dragon seems to be emerging from the wall and plunging underground. This part of the dragon is opaque. The second and third parts depict the arch of the dragon&#x27;s back coming out of the pavement. These parts of the dragon are transparent, and water under pressure flows visibly within, and is illuminated at night.

==Musical fountains==

Musical fountains create a theatrical spectacle with music, light and water, usually employing a variety of programmable spouts and water jets controlled by a computer.

Musical fountains were first described in the 1st century AD by the Greek scientist and engineer Hero of Alexandria in his book &quot;Pneumatics&quot;. Hero described and provided drawings of &quot;A bird made to whistle by flowing water,&quot; &quot;A Trumpet sounded by flowing water,&quot; and &quot;Birds made to sing and be silent alternately by flowing water.&quot; In Hero&#x27;s descriptions, water pushed air through musical instruments to make sounds. It is not known if Hero made working models of any of his designs.

During the Italian Renaissance, the most famous musical fountains were located in the gardens of the Villa d&#x27;Este, in Tivoli. which were created between 1550 and 1572. Following the ideas of Hero of Alexandria, the Fountain of the Owl used a series of bronze pipes like flutes to make the sound of birds. The most famous feature of the garden was the great Organ Fountain. It was described by the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne, who visited the garden in 1580: &quot;The music of the Organ Fountain is true music, naturally created ... made by water which falls with great violence into a cave, rounded and vaulted, and agitates the air, which is forced to exit through the pipes of an organ. Other water, passing through a wheel, strikes in a certain order the keyboard of the organ. The organ also imitates the sound of trumpets, the sound of cannon, and the sound of muskets, made by the sudden fall of water ... The Organ Fountain fell into ruins, but it was recently restored and plays music again.

Louis XIV created the idea of the modern musical fountain by staging spectacles in the Gardens of Versailles, using music and fireworks to accompany the flow of the fountains.

The great international expositions held in Philadelphia, London and Paris featured the ancestors of the modern musical fountain. They introduced the first fountains illuminated by gas lights (Philadelphia in 1876); and the first fountains illuminated by electric lights (London in 1884 and Paris in 1889). The Exposition Universelle (1900) in Paris featured fountains illuminated by colored lights controlled by a keyboard. The Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931 presented the Théâtre d&#x27;eau, or water theater, located in a lake, with performance of dancing water. The Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937) had combined arches and columns of water from fountains in the Seine with light, and with music from loudspeakers on eleven rafts anchored in the river, playing the music of the leading composers of the time. (See International Exposition Fountains, above.)

Today some of the best-known musical fountains in the world are at the Bellagio Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, (2009); the Dubai Fountain in the United Arab Emirates; the World of Color at Disney California Adventure Park (2010) and Aquanura at the Efteling in the Netherlands (2012).

==Splash fountains==

A splash fountain or bathing fountain is intended for people to come in and cool off on hot summer days. These fountains are also referred to as interactive fountains. These fountains are designed to allow easy access, and feature nonslip surfaces, and have no standing water, to eliminate possible drowning hazards, so that no lifeguards or supervision is required. These splash pads are often located in public pools, public parks, or public playgrounds (known as &quot;spraygrounds&quot;). In some splash fountains, such as Dundas Square in Toronto, Canada, the water is heated by solar energy captured by the special dark-colored granite slabs. The fountain at Dundas Square features 600 ground nozzles arranged in groups of 30 (3 rows of 10 nozzles). Each group of 30 nozzles is located beneath a stainless steel grille. Twenty such grilles are arranged in two rows of 10, in the middle of the main walkway through Dundas Square.

==Drinking fountain==
A water fountain or drinking fountain is designed to provide drinking water and has a basin arrangement with either continuously running water or a tap. The drinker bends down to the stream of water and swallows water directly from the stream. Modern indoor drinking fountains may incorporate filters to remove impurities from the water and chillers to reduce its temperature. In some regional dialects, water fountains are called &quot;bubblers&quot;. Water fountains are usually found in public places, like schools, rest areas, libraries, and grocery stores. Many jurisdictions require water fountains to be wheelchair accessible (by sticking out horizontally from the wall), and to include an additional unit of a lower height for children and short adults. The design that this replaced often had one spout atop a refrigeration unit.

In 1859, The Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association was established to promote the provision of drinking water for people and animals in the United Kingdom and overseas. More recently, in 2010, the FindaFountain campaign was launched in the UK to encourage people to use drinking fountains instead of environmentally damaging bottled water. A map showing the location of UK drinking water fountains is published on the FindaFountain website.

==How fountains work==


From Roman times until the end of the 19th century, fountains operated by gravity, requiring a source of water higher than the fountain itself to make the water flow. The greater the difference between the elevation of the source of water and the fountain, the higher the water would go upwards from the fountain.

In Roman cities, water for fountains came from lakes and rivers and springs in the hills, brought into city in aqueducts and then distributed to fountains through a system of lead pipes.

From the Middle Ages onwards, fountains in villages or towns were connected to springs, or to channels which brought water from lakes or rivers. In Provence, a typical village fountain consisted of a pipe or underground duct from a spring at a higher elevation than the fountain. The water from the spring flowed down to the fountain, then up a tube into a bulb-shaped stone vessel, like a large vase with a cover on top. The inside of the vase, called the &quot;bassin de répartition&quot;, was filled with water up to a level just above the mouths of the canons, or spouts, which slanted downwards. The water poured down through the canons, creating a siphon, so that the fountain ran continually.

In cities and towns, residents filled vessels or jars of water jets from the canons of the fountain or paid a water porter to bring the water to their home. Horses and domestic animals could drink the water in the basin below the fountain. The water not used often flowed into a separate series of basins, a lavoir, used for washing and rinsing clothes. After being used for washing, the same water then ran through a channel to the town&#x27;s kitchen garden. In Provence, since clothes were washed with ashes, the water that flowed into the garden contained potassium, and was valuable as fertilizer.

The most famous fountains of the Renaissance, at the Villa d&#x27;Este in Tivoli, were located on a steep slope near a river; the builders ran a channel from the river to a large fountain at top of the garden, which then fed other fountains and basins on the levels below. The fountains of Rome, built from the Renaissance through the 18th century, took their water from rebuilt Roman aqueducts which brought water from lakes and rivers at a higher elevation than the fountains. Those fountains with a high source of water, such as the Triton Fountain, could shoot water in air. Fountains with a lower source, such as the Trevi Fountain, could only have water pour downwards. The architect of the Trevi Fountain placed it below street level to make the flow of water seem more dramatic.

The fountains of Versailles depended upon water from reservoirs just above the fountains. As King Louis XIV built more fountains, he was forced to construct an enormous complex of pumps, called the Machine de Marly, with fourteen water wheels and 220 pumps, to raise water 162 meters above the Seine River to the reservoirs to keep his fountains flowing. Even with the Machine de Marly, the fountains used so much water that they could not be all turned on at the same time. Fontainiers watched the progress of the King when he toured the gardens and turned on each fountain just before he arrived.

The architects of the fountains at Versailles designed specially-shaped nozzles, or tuyaux, to form the water into different shapes, such as fans, bouquets, and umbrellas.

In Germany, some courts and palace gardens were situated in flat areas, thus fountains depending on pumped pressurized water were developed at a fairly early point in history. The Great Fountain in Herrenhausen Gardens at Hanover was based on ideas of Gottfried Leibniz conceived in 1694 and was inaugurated in 1719 during the visit of George I. After some improvements, it reached a height of some 35 m in 1721 which made it the highest fountain in European courts. The fountains at the Nymphenburg Palace initially were fed by water pumped to water towers, but as from 1803 were operated by the water powered Nymphenburg Pumping Stations which are still working.

Beginning in the 19th century, fountains ceased to be used for drinking water and became purely ornamental. By the beginning of the 20th century, cities began using steam pumps and later electric pumps to send water to the city fountains. Later in the 20th century, urban fountains began to recycle their water through a closed . An electric pump, often placed under the water, pushes the water through the pipes. The water must be regularly topped up to offset water lost to evaporation, and allowance must be made to handle overflow after heavy rain.

In modern fountains a water filter, typically a media filter, removes particles from the water—this filter requires its own pump to force water through it and plumbing to remove the water from the pool to the filter and then back to the pool. The water may need chlorination or anti-algal treatment, or may use biological methods to filter and clean water.

The pumps, filter, electrical switch box and plumbing controls are often housed in a &quot;plant room&quot;.
Low-voltage lighting, typically 12 volt direct current, is used to minimise electrical hazards. Lighting is often submerged and must be suitably designed. High wattage lighting (incandescent and halogen) either as submerged lighting or accent lighting on waterwall fountains have been implicated in every documented Legionnaires&#x27; disease outbreak associated with fountains. This is detailed in the &quot;Guidelines for Control of Legionella in Ornamental Features&quot;.
Floating fountains are also popular for ponds and lakes; they consist of a float pump nozzle and water chamber.

<text>Michael Daniel Penn (born August 1, 1958) is an American musician, singer and composer. His 1989 single &quot;No Myth&quot; was a top 20 hit in the US and successful in several other countries.

==Early life==
Penn was born in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan. He is the first son of actor and director Leo Penn and actress Eileen Ryan, and the brother of actors Sean Penn and Chris Penn. He is of Lithuanian-Jewish (paternal) and Irish–Italian (maternal) descent. Penn began playing music in junior high school and attended Santa Monica High School.

==Career==
Prior to the release of his 1989 debut album &quot;March&quot;, Penn was a member of the Los Angeles band Doll Congress. Penn was one of two musical guests as a solo artist on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on the October 24, 1987 episode, with his brother Sean hosting. Penn had also appeared as an extra on a few television series, including &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;.

&quot;March&quot;, particularly the first single, &quot;No Myth&quot;, brought Penn attention, as well as the 1990 MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. Penn&#x27;s follow-up albums &quot;Free-for-All&quot; (1992), &quot;Resigned&quot; (1997), &quot;MP4: Days Since a Lost Time Accident&quot; (2000), &quot;Mr. Hollywood Jr., 1947&quot; (2005) and &quot;Palms and Runes, Tarot and Tea&quot; (2007) weren&#x27;t able to match the commercial success of &quot;March&quot;, although critics continued to praise his songcraft.

Penn&#x27;s second album, &quot;Free-for-All&quot;, was praised by critics but was not as commercially successful as his debut. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;stunning&quot; and &quot;CMJ&quot; wrote that the album &quot;exhausts any doubts&quot; about whether &quot;March&quot; was a fluke.

Penn collaborated with surrealist animators The Brothers Quay on &quot;Long Way Down (Look What the Cat Drug In)&quot;, which was shown on MTV as well as in film festivals around the country.

He has worked extensively creating original music for film. He scored Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s films &quot;Hard Eight&quot; (1996) and &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997); he also appears in the latter in a cameo role as a recording engineer. During the editing of the film, Anderson directed a music video with Penn for &quot;Try&quot; from &quot;Resigned&quot;, which was filmed in one long shot (the video can be found on the &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; DVD). Other films scored by Penn include Alan Cumming&#x27;s first two directorial efforts, &quot;The Anniversary Party&quot; and &quot;Suffering Man&#x27;s Charity&quot;; &quot;American Teen&quot;, &quot;Sunshine Cleaning&quot;; the documentary &quot;The Comedians of Comedy&quot;; and &quot;The Last Kiss&quot;. In 2003, he was nominated for a DVDX Award for Best Original Score in a DVD Premiere Movie for &quot;Melvin Goes to Dinner&quot;.

Penn has produced recordings for Aimee Mann, The Wallflowers and Liz Phair.

In August 2005, Penn released &quot;Mr. Hollywood Jr., 1947&quot; on his own Mimeograph Records label. Its songs are set against the background of post-World War II Los Angeles; Penn said he chose the year because of several notable events that took place then, including the passage of the National Security Act and the invention of the transistor. The album was reissued by Legacy Recordings in April 2007 with bonus tracks from a KCRW session.

The reissue came in conjunction with Legacy&#x27;s release of &quot;Palms and Runes, Tarot and Tea: A Michael Penn Collection&quot;, a compilation that includes several alternate versions and previously unreleased songs. Penn said his goal in compiling, ordering tracks for and producing &quot;Palms and Runes&quot; was to &quot;make it feel like an album&quot; in its own right.

In late 2009, Penn composed the music for the film &quot;That Evening Sun&quot;. In 2012, Penn began work as the composer for the HBO TV show &quot;Girls&quot;. In January 2013, the &quot;Girls Vol. 1&quot; soundtrack was released on iTunes. The album contained a new song by Michael Penn titled &quot;On Your Way&quot;, which was featured in the finale of Season 1.

He also joined the crew of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Masters of Sex&quot; in 2013 as series composer. The show&#x27;s pilot episode was initially set to be scored by Thomas Newman, but this did not come to fruition and Penn scored both the pilot and the rest of the series.

In 2018, he joined &quot;Good Girls&quot; on NBC and &quot;Here and Now&quot; on HBO as a composer. In 2020, Penn released a new single, &quot;A Revival&quot;. It was his first non-soundtrack work in 15 years.

== Personal life ==

Penn met fellow singer-songwriter Aimee Mann, and during the recording of her album &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot; (to which Penn contributed), the two struck up a friendship, which blossomed into romance and their subsequent marriage on December 29, 1997. Together with manager Michael Hausman they formed United Musicians, an independent music collective founded on &quot;the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created and that this ownership is the basis for artistic strength and true independence.&quot; Penn and Mann live in Los Angeles.

His niece is actress Dylan Penn.

<doc id="384706" wikidata="Q7764146" url="?curid=384706" title="The Sifl and Olly Show">
<text>The Sifl and Olly Show is a comedy TV series that incorporates sock puppets, animation, and musical performances. Musicians Liam Lynch and Matt Crocco created and performed the series. The first episode aired on MTV in 1998. The show was cancelled in 1999. The characters, along with new material, currently appear on Liam Lynch&#x27;s podcast entitled &quot;Lynchland&quot;.

==History==
The origins of &quot;The Sifl &amp; Olly Show&quot; go back to the 1980s. As children, Crocco and Lynch would create and perform funny songs and sketches to entertain themselves. They remained friends through high school and college, even though they saw little of each other while they attended Kent State University. Lynch left Kent State and the duo was separated for a few years, but they reunited in Nashville, Tennessee in the 1990s and recorded the comedy album &quot;Camp Sunny Side Up&quot; on a 4-Track. During this period they were also constantly recording funny conversations, interviews, sketches, and songs. Soon after, Lynch moved to Liverpool, England to attend the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, but the friends continued to make funny recordings and send them to each other.

In 1995, while Lynch was still in Liverpool, he found some broken 4-Track tapes and repaired them. These tapes contained conversations and material intended for his and Crocco&#x27;s second comedy album (which they never recorded). He decided to make something using these tapes as a Christmas present for Crocco. Lynch had been inspired by a series of British commercials by Aardman Studios and had hoped to do stop-action clay animation, but he did not have the money or the equipment for it. Instead, he made puppets out of his own socks and a large plastic sunflower and recorded a video of himself acting out their tapes with the puppets. Lynch chose the name for the puppets from a fake commercial Crocco had made for one of their recordings, and Sifl &amp; Olly were born.

Lynch sent copies to MTV and MTV Europe, and although MTV America rejected them, MTV Europe liked them. In 1996, MTV Europe began airing Sifl &amp; Olly clips between music videos as &quot;idents.&quot; The popularity of the clips led to MTV America offering a half-hour format called &quot;The Sifl &amp; Olly Show&quot; in July 1998. The show aired late at night, but later on they were moved to the evenings.

In the first season, clips of Sifl and Olly were mixed with music videos. Whenever the show was aired again, the music videos would be removed, leaving only the comedy clips. The show gained a cult following, but it was cancelled after the second season. A third season was recorded, and MTV promised to release the episodes on the Internet but never did. The lost episodes were eventually released on DVD.

Despite its cancellation, Sifl and Olly still appear along with some other characters in occasional episodes of Liam Lynch&#x27;s podcast, &quot;Lynchland&quot;. Most of these appearances are clips from Season 3.

On June 14, 2012, Liam Lynch posted a picture on his Twitter account of a set similar to that used on the show, fueling speculation about the show&#x27;s return. This was followed by another picture posted on July 25 of a graphic for &quot;Precious Roy&#x27;s Fruit Chunkies.&quot;

As of November 17, 2014, MTV has released two &quot;best of&quot; compilations on Amazon Video.

==Description==

===Premise===
The two main characters are a black sock puppet named Sifl and a white sock puppet named Olly. Sifl is the calmer leader of the show, while Olly is more excitable and often breaks into crazed furies. Their assistant, Chester, is a mumbling, often nonsensical character who still claims to be great at everything.

The show was always very simple and low-budget. Most of the show&#x27;s main characters were puppets, with background images or animations in the background via a chromakey. The two co-hosts often had a microphone in front of them. The show had an unscripted feel with the characters talking to each other in realistic, often meandering styles. Sifl and Olly would sing both original and classic songs throughout the show with an original song at the end. Though it featured puppets, the series was not intended for children. The humor often featured profanity, sexual references, drug innuendo, crude humor, bodily functions, and violence.

===Regular segments===
Often preceded by familiar intro screen and a short theme song, the segments included:
* Precious Roy&#x27;s Home Shopping Netwerk – a parody of the Home Shopping Network with bizarre products like Civil War corpses, CAT scan glasses, chicken flavored air conditioning, and a bottomless swimming pool. The network was run by Precious Roy who would yell random unrelated lines, ending with &quot;...Suckers!&quot;. The slogan of Precious Roy was &quot;making lots of suckers out of girls and boys.&quot; Sifl and Olly were employed as salesmen for the Network, and Olly inexplicably seemed to go progressively insane during these segments, often yelling crazed accusations at callers, and occasionally showing signs of paranoid schizophrenia.
* Calls from the Public – Sifl and Olly would take calls from random and often bizarre characters (usually sock puppets) who would call with problems or complaints. The most common calls coming from the pair&#x27;s landlord, who would complain about one or more of their antics, often involving monkeys.
* Rock Facts – At commercial breaks, the Rock Facts question would be asked and answered when they returned. The answers were nearly always lies (the only exception being a fact about Queen Latifah) and often involved the singer Björk. This segment was dropped by the second season.
* Interview Time – Guests interviewed included Death, an atom, and G-spot &amp; Orgasm. Sometimes they would announce a famous person that was going to be interviewed, but it would always turn out that the guest was unable to attend (unless the guest was in fact an inanimate object).
* S &amp; O News – Sifl and Olly would pretend to report on the (generally surreal) news. Often Olly would sing nonsensical lyrics to accompany the lead in music (much to the chagrin of Sifl). Sifl, however, would break his professionalism during the segment to refer to his girlfriend, Serena Altschul, either by sending her a message or by praising her.
* A Word with Chester – Sifl and Olly would take a break from other show activities to speak with their friend Chester, who misinterpreted their questions and in general had difficulty focusing on any one subject for any extended period of time. Chester tends to laugh nervously, and sometimes sounds like he&#x27;s a bit stoned. Olly took point in these segments, because Crocco, who provided the voice for Sifl, also provided the voice of Chester. In the second season, a new segment called &quot;Letters to Chester&quot; was added, which was essentially the same premise (including using the same theme music), with the addition of Olly reading a letter addressed to Chester at the start of the segment.
* And Now... ROCK – A song is performed by one or more of the characters
* It&#x27;s Almost the End of the Show – Every episode ends with a song performed by Sifl and/or Olly, occasionally with vocal assistance by other characters.
* Kickin&#x27; It Old School – Introduced in the second season, a song from the &quot;And Now... ROCK&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s Almost the End of the Show&quot; segments is simply re-aired, occasionally with the pre-song banter cut out.

===Characters===
;Sifl : Voiced by Matt Crocco. His body is a black sock with yellow, reptilian eyes and hair made out of green, plastic sunflower leaves. Sifl is often portrayed as the calm leader of the show. He is skilled at picking up women and is something of a technological whiz, capable of building and programming robots and somehow performing maintenance on a spacebound satellite without leaving the studio. Although a childhood friend of Olly, he is subtly manipulative and often deceives Olly or uses him as a scapegoat. He is often shown to have wasted the show&#x27;s budget on mysterious ventures that are never described on screen, resulting in everything from guests canceling to mafia threats. An episode in the second season implies that he was once married to Olly&#x27;s mom and is, in fact, Olly&#x27;s father (despite also being a childhood friend of Olly).
;Olly : Voice by Liam Lynch. His body is a white sock with large, brown eyes and a dog-like nose. His hair is made from clippings of plastic sunflower petal and he wears a sweater, or more specifically, a sweater sleeve. Olly is emotional and prone to fits of violence, and prone to bouts of total insanity during Precious Roy ads. During the Precious Roy ads, Olly&#x27;s grammar shows characteristics of the Central Pennsylvania dialect. (He mentions both that a suit &quot;never needs ironed&quot; and that &quot;the dog needs walked&quot;.) He is easily deceived and has difficulty with women. He has difficulty holding back his laughter at times, especially when he&#x27;s talking with Chester. Olly originally performs &quot;United States of Whatever,&quot; one of the most successful songs from Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Fake Songs&quot; CD. The song was performed in response to Sifl bringing several of Olly&#x27;s ex-girlfriends to the show so they could make fun of Olly.
; Chester : Voiced by Matt Crocco. Chester was born in Las Vegas, raised by a tap dancing tribe (S1E1). A typical stoner, his head is an inverted rubber mould for a Buddha figurine, his eyelashes are plastic sunflower petals, and a sweater sleeve composes most of his body. This gives him a distinct shape, resulting in a vacant smile and the appearance of innards in his mouth. His eyes are the same as Olly&#x27;s, with the addition of large, petal-like eyebrows. Chester announces the beginning of the show, though he is not skilled at the task, occasionally referring to Sifl &amp; Olly by the wrong names (such as Starsky and Hutch), or simply refusing to perform the announcement. Usually laughs softly as he talks. Chester considers himself a Don Juan, though the other characters imply that Chester has never been with a woman. He is very forgetful, often forgetting that he lives in the studio, that he is on a television show, or that the fans in the &quot;Letters to Chester&quot; segments aren&#x27;t in the studio. He is obsessed with cereal, and it is implied that he eats it constantly, though he is rarely seen doing so on screen. He collects water, which he proudly proclaims to possess the entire set of (in the form of ice, steam, and regular water). He occasionally wanders into other skits and often doesn&#x27;t realize that the skits aren&#x27;t real (such as thinking that he had wandered into space while entering the set of a Star Wars parody). He is occasionally sold or traded by Olly, such as being sold to a freak show for $20 or used to pay Sifl&#x27;s debt to the mafia.
; Precious Roy : Also voiced by Crocco. His body is a green sock with enormous eyes (pointing in different directions) and a pair of wire glasses. The puppeteer&#x27;s hand is positioned awkwardly within the sock, adding to Precious&#x27; bizarre persona. He is the owner of the Precious Roy Home Shopping Netwerk, which Sifl &amp; Olly are spokesmen for. He speaks in non sequiturs, seems unaware of what his products actually are, and punctuates his last sentence of the segment with &quot;suckers!&quot;.
; Cody : Voiced by Liam Lynch. A friend of Sifl and Chester, but not so much Olly. Often Cody will stop by the show to confirm plans with Sifl for later; usually involving hookers or other unseemly behavior.
; Stealth : Voiced by Liam Lynch. A violent degenerate with a grudge against Olly (Olly drove a golf cart through his bar mitzvah dressed in a beaver costume). Sifl and Olly eventually defeat him by singing Twisted Sister&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot;, which somehow sends Stealth into space in a spinning square resembling the Phantom Zone in Superman II. Is perpetually smoking a cigarette.
; Julio : A small child who calls the show, usually to ask for advice. Liam Lynch mentioned on the &quot;sockheads&quot; list that Julio was voiced by a real 3-year-old named Julio.
; Zafo : Voiced by guitarist/producer &quot;Chris Tench&quot;. He spoke in an electronically distorted voice which sounds like a person speaking through a vocoder or a talk box. He is idolized by Sifl and Olly as well as a number of other characters in the show. On more than one occasion the world has been marked for destruction by a creature or object from space that was using the shows &quot;Calls from the Public&quot; forum to announce a final warning, leaving Sifl &amp; Olly with a &quot;big decision to make&quot; when they discovered that Zafo had a show that night.
; Peto and Flek : The main characters of Sifl and Olly&#x27;s favorite show from their childhood. Peto is portrayed as being rude and vulgar, while Flek can only speak by saying the sound &quot;guh-guh-guh-guh&quot;.
; Jimmy : Voiced by Mike Taylor. Sifl &amp; Olly&#x27;s camera man, his dialogue usually cannot be heard clearly and he rarely appears on screen.
; The Landlord : Voiced by Liam Lynch. The landlord for Sifl &amp; Olly&#x27;s apartment (some episodes, however, imply that the duo actually live in their studio. It is possible that they simply tape their show in their apartment, but some segments clearly imply that the two are &quot;not home&quot; during taping). He is made out of an opaque brown stocking with grey yarn hair and eyebrows. He also has a tattered white sleeve covering most of his body, giving him a disheveled appearance. This is enhanced by the puppeteer, whose knuckles are positioned prominently in the puppet, increasing its aggressive appearance. The Landlord frequently calls during the &quot;Calls from the Public&quot; segments to yell at Sifl and Olly about something they&#x27;re doing on his property, such as breeding monkeys or building a water slide. He threatens to kick them out regularly, but the duo has already built a moat around their apartment filled with crocodiles and guarded by archer monkeys.
; Champs 1 Team : A group of students, led by &quot;John from Ohio University,&quot; who won the &quot;Sifl &amp; Olly: Free Access to the Moon&quot; contest, in which they were launched in a space ship to the moon for a three-year mission. However, they weren&#x27;t given any tasks to perform during their mission, and Sifl &amp; Olly assumed the team would simply enjoy the freedom of being on the moon, such as the fact that there are no police on the moon. Before long all of the crew has died but one member, who eventually dies after the robot chicken pecks at a wrong button and sends the ship into the sun.
; Grout : Voiced by Matt Crocco. A black and white striped long stocking with round yellow eyes on what look like black pipe cleaners. He is a self-proclaimed space expert who shows up as a guest or as host of his game show, trivia trapezoids.
; Paul Rogers : Voiced by Matt Crocco. Disgruntled host of &#x27;Functions of the Family&#x27;, &quot;Your 8000 step plan to better living&quot;. Intended as a self-help plan, he apparently went through some bad events recently. As such, his show generally devolves within seconds to him crying about his current situation in life, (specifically &quot;I DON&#x27;T HAVE A FAMILY!&quot;) and screaming at his unseen announcer, Dale. The typical episode ends with Dale quitting. Paul is one of the few non-sock puppet characters, played by a plastic elf hand puppet.
; Aesop Jones : A television chef, and another of the few non-sock characters (he is simply a doll dressed like a chef). Aesop&#x27;s speech is incomprehensible. All his cooking endeavors seem to involve him actually cooking himself, somehow transforming his actual body into whatever it was he was supposed to be cooking (such as covering himself in dough, dipping his head into a vat of lard, and emerging with his head as a perfect, chocolate frosted doughnut). In the second season he has a female assistant (made out of a sock) whom he is romantically involved with.
; Jargon Scott : A salesperson who often turns up on the &quot;Calls From the Public&quot; portion of the show to try and sell legless dogs to Sifl and Olly. Jargon constantly tries to explain to them the benefits of owning legless dogs, such as: they never run away, you never have to walk them, they&#x27;re safe around children, etc. When this doesn&#x27;t convince them to buy, he often enlists the help of a telemarketer named Cindy to use typical telemarketing fast talk and special offers to trick them into buying his &quot;hot, legless dogs.&quot; The call usually ends with Jargon interrupting Cindy, exclaiming &quot;You guys don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing...I got legless dogs here!&quot;
; Eddie from Jersey : Frequent caller during the &quot;Calls From The Public&quot; segment of the show. Eddie can be seen wearing a S&amp;M-style mask and always makes it a point to insult Sifl, usually by calling him a variation of the term &quot;egg-ass&quot; (i.e. &quot;Hey Sifl, you&#x27;re a rotten, slouched-back, egg-ass!&quot;). Once he is reminded that he can be seen, he usually attempts to hide or change his story.
; Sex Girl : Voiced by Terry Hudson. A female prostitute who occasionally shows up in the Interview section of the show. After a brief talk, usually Sifl and Olly decide to make out with Sex Girl. Sifl usually goes first, making awkward noises and distracting Olly, while Olly always blows his chance with Sex Girl giving lines such as &quot;Everything I&#x27;m about to do to you baby, I learned at Seaworld.&quot;
; Deuce Loosely : Voiced by Liam Lynch. An insane caller who wears a panda mask, he is utterly obsessed about pandas whenever he appears. He seems to think pandas are magical beings, that are unstoppable vicious beasts. He is constantly hated by Sifl and Olly during his appearances, who find him annoying, and despise his blatantly false panda &quot;facts&quot;. He has performed two songs about pandas in the show, (one in the first season, and one in the recent revival), and he claims they &quot;will cease at number 820&quot;.
; Cereal Mascots : A collection of rejected cereal mascots allowed to pitch their cereals again in episode 1-06. Includes Modem Mutt of Suger Coated Cyber Flakes (Download a bowl into your stomach today! It&#x27;s good to the last megabyte and that&#x27;s free surfing in fiber space!), Bing the Chlorinator of Watertower Nuggets (Great Cereal, a little high chlorine, kinda dangerous, but good though.), Eddie from Rubber Fantasies (Eddie from Jersey, immediately cut off by Sifl), Sugar Bunny of Super Sugar Carrots (They got real sugar!), Breakfast Beaver of Carpenter Crunch (Two scoops of nails in every bag. This cereal comes in a bag), Rascal Rooster of Raisin Hell (A million raisins in every can!)

==Fanbase==
Fans of the show call themselves &quot;sockheads&quot;. There is also an online group of &quot;Sifl and Olly&quot; video traders that are petitioning MTV to release the entire series on DVD. One group of fans even recorded a tribute CD recreating some of their favorite songs called &quot;Banging on Some Pots and Pans.&quot; The Sockheads mailing list group also organized a convention in Nashville called Cresvention.

Cartoonist Aaron McGruder is a fan of the show. On one episode of his TV show &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, Huey exclaims to his grandfather&#x27;s girlfriend that he is doing &quot;prostitute laundry&quot;, which could be a direct reference to &quot;Sifl and Olly&quot;&#x27;s song of the same name. A strip published on 4/28/00 also references the show, where character Michael Caesar is seen lamenting its cancellation. Award-winning writer J. Michael Straczynski was also a noted fan of the show, and at one time Lynch and Crocco were planning a sock puppet character voiced by Straczynski until the show was cancelled.

==&quot;Sifl and Olly Video Game Reviews&quot;==
In 2012, it was teased by Liam Lynch, via Twitter, that Sifl and Olly may return. On September 2, 2012, a promo appeared on the Machinima YouTube channel for a new show called &quot;Sifl &amp; Olly Video Game Reviews.&quot; The first episode premiered on September 9, 2012. After the credits of the eighth video game review episode which aired on October 28, 2012, it was announced that Sifl &amp; Olly were being moved to the Nerdist YouTube Channel. One &quot;season,&quot; consisting of 5 episodes, was made available on that channel in 2013, ending April 18.

== Video game ==
In July 2018, it was reported that American video game publisher Devolver Digital was in talks with &quot;The Sifl and Olly Show&quot; intellectual property owner Lynch to create a video game based on the show&#x27;s license.

<doc id="384709" wikidata="Q682547" url="?curid=384709" title="Dacian language">
<text>Dacian () is an extinct language generally believed to be a member of the Indo-European language family that was spoken in the ancient region of Dacia.

The Dacian language is poorly documented. Unlike Phrygian, which is documented by c. 200 inscriptions, only one Dacian inscription is believed to have survived. The Dacian names for a number of medicinal plants and herbs may survive in ancient literary texts, including about 60 plant-names in Dioscorides. About 1,150 personal names and 900 toponyms may also be of Dacian origin. A few hundred words in modern Romanian and Albanian may have originated in ancient Balkan languages such as Dacian (see List of Romanian words of possible Dacian origin). Linguists have reconstructed about 100 Dacian words from placenames using established techniques of comparative linguistics, although only 20–25 such reconstructions had achieved wide acceptance by 1982.

==Origin==
There is scholarly consensus that Dacian was a member of the Indo-European family of languages. These descended, according to the two leading theories of the expansion of IE languages, from a proto-Indo-European (PIE) language that originated in an urheimat (&quot;original homeland&quot;) in the southern Ukraine/ Caucasus region (Kurgan hypothesis) or in central Anatolia (Anatolian hypothesis). According to both theories, Indo-European reached the Carpathian region no later than c. 2500 BC.

According to one scenario, proto-Thracian populations emerged during the Bronze Age from the fusion of the indigenous Eneolithic (Chalcolithic) population with the intruders of the transitional Indo-Europeanization Period. From these proto-Thracians, in the Iron Age, developed the Dacians / North Thracians of the Danubian-Carpathian Area on the one hand and the Thracians of the eastern Balkan Peninsula on the other.

According to Georgiev, the Dacian language was spread south of the Danube by tribes from Carpathia, who reached the central Balkans in the period 2000–1000 BC, with further movements (e.g., the Triballi tribe) after 1000 BC, until c. 300 BC. According to the ancient geographer Strabo, Daco-Moesian was further spread into Asia Minor in the form of Mysian by a migration of the Moesi people; Strabo asserts that Moesi and Mysi were variants of the same name.

== Linguistic classification ==
Dacian was an Indo-European language (IE). Russu (1967, 1969 and 1970) suggested that its phonological system, and therefore that of its presumed Thraco-Dacian parent-language, was relatively close to the primitive IE system.

While there is general agreement among scholars that Dacian was an Indo-European language, there are divergent opinions about its place within the IE family:
* Dacian and the extinct Thracian language were members of a single dialect continuum; e.g., and .
* Dacian was a language distinct from Thracian but closely related to it, belonging to the same branch of the Indo-European family (a &quot;Thraco-Dacian&quot;, or &quot;Daco-Thracian&quot; branch has been theorised by some linguists).
* Dacian, Thracian, the Baltic languages (Duridanov also adds Pelasgian) formed a distinct branch of Indo-European, e.g., Schall (1974), Duridanov (1976), Radulescu (1987) and Mayer (1996).
* Daco-Moesian was the ancestor of Albanian, belonging to a branch other than Thracian, but closely related to Thracian and distinct from Illyrian. Proposed by Georgiev (1977), this view has not gained wide acceptance among scholars and is rejected by most linguists, who consider that Albanian belongs to the Illyrian branch of IE, either as a direct descendant or as a sister language.

Several linguists classify Dacian as a &quot;satem&quot; IE language: Russu, Rădulescu, Katičić and Križman. In Crossland&#x27;s opinion (1982), both Thracian and Dacian feature one of the main satem characteristics, the change of Indo-European *k and *g to s and z. But the other characteristic satem changes are doubtful in Thracian and are not evidenced in Dacian. In any case, the satem/centum distinction, once regarded as a fundamental division between IE languages, is no longer considered as important in historical linguistics by mainstream scholars. It is now recognised that it is only one of many isoglosses in the IE zone; that languages can exhibit both types at the same time, and that these may change over time within a particular language. There is much controversy about the place of Dacian in the IE evolutionary tree. According to a dated view, Dacian derived from a Daco-Thraco-Phrygian (or &quot;Paleo-Balkan&quot;) branch of IE. Today, Phrygian is no longer widely seen as linked in this way to Dacian and Thracian.

In contrast, the hypothesis of a Thraco-Dacian or Daco-Thracian branch of IE, indicating a close link between the Thracian and Dacian languages, has numerous adherents, including Russu 1967, Georg Solta 1980, Vraciu 1980, Crossland 1982, Rădulescu 1984, 1987. Mihailov (2008) and Trask 2000. The Daco-Thracian theory is ultimately based on the testimony of several Greco-Roman authors: most notably the Roman imperial-era historian and geographer Strabo, who states that the Dacians, Getae, Moesians and Thracians all spoke the same language. Herodotus states that &quot;the Getae are the bravest and the most just amongst the Thracians&quot;, linking the Getae with the Thracians. Some scholars also see support for a close link between the Thracian and Dacian languages in the works of Cassius Dio, Trogus Pompeius, Appian and Pliny the Elder.

But the Daco-Thracian theory has been challenged since the 1960s by the Bulgarian linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev and his followers. Georgiev argues, on phonetic, lexical and toponymic grounds, that Thracian, Dacian and Phrygian were completely different languages, each a separate branch of IE, and that no Daco-Thraco-Phrygian or Daco-Thracian branches of IE ever existed. Georgiev argues that the distance between Dacian and Thracian was approximately the same as that between the Armenian and Persian languages, which are completely different languages. In elaborating the phonology of Dacian, Georgiev uses plant-names attested to in Dioscorides and Pseudo-Apuleius, ascertaining their literal meanings, and hence their etymology, using the Greek translations provided by those authors. The phonology of Dacian produced in this way is very different from that of Thracian; the vowel change IE *o &gt; *a recurs and the k-sounds undergo the changes characteristic of the satem languages. For the phonology of Thracian, Georgiev uses the principle that an intelligible placename in a modern language is likely to be a translation of an ancient name.

Georgiev (1977) also argues that the modern Albanian language is descended from Dacian, specifically from what he called Daco-Moesian or Daco-Mysian, the Moesian dialect of Dacian, but this view has not gained wide acceptance among scholars and is rejected by most linguists, who consider that Albanian belongs to the Illyrian branch of IE. Polomé accepts the view that Albanian is descended from Illyrian but considers the evidence inconclusive.

=== Relationship with ancient languages ===

==== Thracian ====
There is general agreement among scholars that Dacian and Thracian were Indo-European languages; however, widely divergent views exist about their relationship:
# Dacian was a northern dialect or a slightly distinct variety of the Thracian language. Alternatively, Thracian was a southern dialect of Dacian which developed relatively late. Linguists use the term Daco-Thracian or Thraco-Dacian to denote this presumed Dacian and Thracian common language. On this view, these dialects may have possessed a high degree of mutual intelligibility.
# Dacian and Thracian were distinct but related languages, descended from a hypothetical Daco-Thracian branch of Indo-European. One suggestion is that the Dacian differentiation from Thracian may have taken place after 1500 BC. In this scenario, the two languages may have possessed only limited mutual intelligibility.
# Dacian and Thracian were related, constituting separate branches of IE. However, they shared a large number of words, which were mutual borrowings due to long-term geographical proximity. Nevertheless, they would not have been mutually intelligible.

Georgiev (1977) and Duridanov (1985) argue that the phonetic development from proto-Indo-European of the two languages was clearly divergent.
Note: Asterisk indicates reconstructed PIE sound. ∅ is a zero symbol (no sound, when the sound has been dropped).

Georgiev and Duridanov argue that the phonetic divergences above prove that the Dacian and Thracian (and Phrygian, per Georgiev) languages could not have descended from the same branch of Indo-European, but must have constituted separate, stand-alone branches. However, the validity of this conclusion has been challenged due to a fundamental weakness in the source-material for sound-change reconstruction. Since the ancient Balkan languages never developed their own alphabets, ancient Balkan linguistic elements (mainly placenames and personal names) are known only through their Greek or Latin transcripts. These may not accurately reproduce the indigenous sounds, e.g., Greek and Latin had no dedicated graphic signs for phonemes such as č, ġ, ž, š and others. Thus, if a Thracian or Dacian word contained such a phoneme, a Greek or Latin transcript would not represent it accurately. Because of this, there are divergent and even contradictory assumptions for the phonological structure and development of the Dacian and Thracian languages. This can be seen from the different sound-changes proposed by Georgiev and Duridanov, reproduced above, even though these scholars agree that Thracian and Dacian were different languages. Also, some sound-changes proposed by Georgiev have been disputed, e.g., that IE *T (tenuis) became Thracian TA (tenuis aspiratae), and *M (mediae) = T: it has been argued that in both languages IE *MA (mediae aspiratae) fused into M and that *T remained unchanged. Georgiev&#x27;s claim that IE *o mutated into a in Thracian, has been disputed by Russu.

A comparison of Georgiev&#x27;s and Duridanov&#x27;s reconstructed words with the same meaning in the two languages shows that, although they shared some words, many words were different. However, even if such reconstructions are accepted as valid, an insufficient quantity of words have been reconstructed in each language to establish that they were unrelated.

According to Georgiev (1977), Dacian placenames and personal names are completely different from their Thracian counterparts. However, Tomaschek (1883) and Mateescu (1923) argue that some common elements exist in Dacian and Thracian placenames and personal names, but Polomé considered that research had, by 1982, confirmed Georgiev&#x27;s claim of a clear onomastic divide between Thrace and Moesia/Dacia.

Georgiev highlighted a striking divergence between placename-suffixes in Dacia/Moesia and Thrace: Daco-Moesian placenames generally carry the suffix &quot;-dava&quot; (variants: &quot;-daba&quot;, &quot;-deva&quot;), meaning &quot;town&quot; or &quot;stronghold&quot;. But placenames in Thrace proper, i.e. south of the Balkan mountains commonly end in &quot;-para&quot; or &quot;-pera&quot;, meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot; (cf Sanskrit &quot;pura&quot; = &quot;town&quot;, from which derives Hindi town-suffix &quot;-pur&quot;, e.g., Udaipur = &quot;city of Udai&quot;). Map showing -dava/-para divide Georgiev argues that such toponymic divergence renders the notion that Thracian and Dacian were the same language implausible. However, this thesis has been challenged on a number of grounds:
# Papazoglu (1978) and Tacheva (1997) reject the argument that such different placename-suffixes imply different languages (although, in general historical linguistics, changes in placename-suffixes are regarded as potentially strong evidence of changes in prevalent language). A possible objection is that, in 2 regions of Thrace, &quot;-para&quot; is not the standard suffix: in NE Thrace, placenames commonly end in &quot;-bria&quot; (&quot;town&quot;), while in SE Thrace, &quot;-diza&quot;/&quot;-dizos&quot; (&quot;stronghold&quot;) is the most common ending. Following Georgiev&#x27;s logic, this would indicate that these regions spoke a language different from Thracian. It is possible that this was the case: NE Thrace, for example, was a region of intensive Celtic settlement and may, therefore, have retained Celtic speech into Roman imperial times. If, on the other hand, the different endings were due simply to Thracian regional dialectal variations, the same could be true of the dava/para divide.
# Papazoglu (1978) and Fisher (2003) point out that two &quot;-dava&quot; placenames are found in Thrace proper, in contravention of Georgiev&#x27;s placename divide: &quot;Pulpudeva&quot; and &quot;Desudaba&quot;. However, according to Georgiev (1977), east of a line formed by the Nestos and Uskur rivers, the traditional western boundary of Thrace proper, &quot;Pulpudeva&quot; is the only known &quot;-dava&quot;-type placename, and Georgiev argues that it is not linguistically significant, as it was an extraneous and late foundation by the Macedonian king Philip II (&quot;Philippopolis&quot;) and its &quot;-dava&quot; name a Moesian import.
# The dava/para divide appears to break down West of the Nestos-Uskur line, where &quot;-dava&quot; placenames, including &quot;Desudaba&quot;, are intermingled with &quot;-para&quot; names. However, this does not necessarily invalidate Georgiev&#x27;s thesis, as this region was the border-zone between the Roman provinces of Moesia Superior and Thracia and the mixed placename suffixes may reflect a mixed Thracian/Moesian population.

Georgiev&#x27;s thesis has by no means achieved general acceptance: the Thraco-Dacian theory retains substantial support among linguists. Crossland (1982) considers that the divergence of a presumed original Thraco-Dacian language into northern and southern groups of dialects is not so significant as to rank them as separate languages. According to Georg Solta (1982), there is no significant difference between Dacian and Thracian. Rădulescu (1984) accepts that Daco-Moesian possesses a certain degree of dialectal individuality, but argues that there is no fundamental separation between Daco-Moesian and Thracian. Renfrew (1990) argues that there is no doubt that Thracian is related to the Dacian which was spoken in modern-day Romania before that area was occupied by the Romans. However, all these assertions are largely speculative, due to the lack of evidence for both languages.

Polomé (1982) considers that the evidence presented by Georgiev and Duridanov, although substantial, is not sufficient to determine whether Daco-Moesian and Thracian were two dialects of the same language or two distinct languages.

==== Moesian ====

The ethnonym Moesi was used within the lands alongside the Danube river, in north-western Thrace. As analysed by some modern scholars, the ancient authors used the name Moesi speculatively to designate Triballians and also Getic and Dacian communities.

==== Illyrian ====
It is possible that Illyrian, Dacian and Thracian were three dialects of the same language, according to Rădulescu. Georgiev (1966), however, considers Illyrian a language closely related to Venetic and Phrygian but with a certain Daco-Moesian admixture. Venetic and Phrygian are considered centum languages, and this may mean that Georgiev, like many other paleolinguists, viewed Illyrian as probably being a centum language with Daco-Moesian admixture. Georgiev proposed that Albanian, a satemised language, developed from Daco-Moesian, a satemised language group, and not from Illyrian. But lack of evidence prevents any firm centum/satem classification for these ancient languages. Renfrew argues that the centum/satem classification is irrelevant in determining relationships between languages. This is because a language may contain both satem and centum features and these, and the balance between them, may change over time.

==== Gothic ====
There was a well-established tradition in the 4th century that the Getae, believed to be Dacians by mainstream scholarship, and the Gothi were the same people, e.g., Orosius: &quot;Getae illi qui et nunc Gothi&quot;. This identification, now discredited, was supported by Jacob Grimm. In pursuit of his hypothesis, Grimm proposed many kindred features between the Getae and Germanic tribes.

=== Relationship with modern languages ===

==== Romanian ====
The mainstream view among scholars is that Daco-Moesian forms the principal linguistic substratum of modern Romanian, a neo-Latin (Romance) language, which evolved from eastern Eastern Romance in the period AD 300–600, according to Georgiev. The possible residual influence of Daco-Moesian on modern Romanian is limited to a modest number of words and a few grammatical peculiarities. According to Georgiev (1981), in Romanian there are about 70 words which have exact correspondences in Albanian, but the phonetic form of these Romanian words is so specific that they cannot be explained as Albanian borrowings. Georgiev claimed that these words belong to the Dacian substratum in Romanian, while their Albanian correspondences were inherited from Daco-Moesian.

As in the case of any Romance language, it is argued that Romanian language derived from Vulgar Latin through a series of internal linguistic changes and because of Dacian or northern Thracian influences on Vulgar Latin in the late Roman era. This influence explains a number of differences between the Romanian-Thracian substrate and the French-Celtic, Spanish-Basque, and Portuguese-Celtic substrates. Romanian has no major dialects, perhaps a reflection of its origin in a small mountain region, which was inaccessible but permitted easy internal communication. The history of Romanian is based on speculation because there are virtually no written records of the area from the time of the withdrawal of the Romans around 300 AD until the end of the barbarian invasions around 1300 AD.

Many scholars, mostly Romanian, have conducted research into a Dacian linguistic substratum for the modern Romanian language. There is still not enough hard evidence for this. None of the few Dacian words known (mainly plant-names) and none of the Dacian words reconstructed from placenames have specific correspondent words in Romanian (as opposed to general correspondents in several IE languages). DEX doesn&#x27;t mention any Dacian etymology, just a number of terms of unknown origin. Most of these are assumed by several scholars to be of Dacian origin, but there is no strong proof that they are. They could, in some cases, also be of pre-Indo-European origin (i.e. truly indigenous, from Stone Age Carpathian languages), or, if clearly Indo-European, be of Sarmatian origin – but there&#x27;s no proof for this either.
It seems plausible that a few Dacian words may have survived in the speech of the Carpathian inhabitants through successive changes in the region&#x27;s predominant languages: Dacian/Celtic (to AD 100), Latin/Sarmatian (c. 100–300), Germanic (c. 300–500), Slavic/Turkic (c. 500–1300), up to the Romanian language when the latter became the predominant language in the region.

===== Substratum of Common Romanian =====

The Romanian language has been denoted &quot;Daco-Romanian&quot; by some scholars because it derives from late Latin superimposed on a Dacian substratum, and evolved in the Roman colony of Dacia between AD 106 and 275. Modern Romanian may contain 160–170 words of Dacian origin. By comparison, modern French, according to Bulei, has approximately 180 words of Celtic origin. The Celtic origin of the French substratum is certain, as the Celtic languages are abundantly documented, whereas the Dacian origin of Romanian words is in most cases speculative.

It is also argued that the Dacian language may form the substratum of Common Romanian, which developed from the Vulgar Latin spoken in the Balkans north of the Jirecek line, which roughly divides Latin influence from Greek influence. About 300 words in Eastern Romance languages, Daco-Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian, may derive from Dacian, and many of these show a satem-reflex. Whether Dacian forms the substratum of Common Romanian is disputed, yet this theory does not rely only on the Romanisation having occurred in Roman Dacia, as Dacian was also spoken in Moesia and northern Dardania. Moesia was conquered by the Romans more than a century before Dacia, and its Latinity is confirmed by Christian sources.
The Dacian / Thracian substratum of Romanian is often connected to the words shared between Romanian and Albanian. The correspondences between these languages reflect a common linguistic background.

==== Albanian ====
Vladimir I. Georgiev, although accepting an Illyrian component in Albanian, and even not excluding an Illyrian origin of Albanian, proposed as the ancestor of Albanian a language called &quot;Daco-Mysian&quot; by him, considering it a separate language from Thracian. Georgiev maintained that &quot;Daco-Mysian tribes gradually migrated to the northern-central part of the Balkan Peninsula, approximately to Dardania, probably in the second millennium B.C. (or not later than the first half of the first millennium B.C.), and thence they migrated to the areas of present Albania&quot;. However, this theory is rejected by most linguists, who consider Albanian a direct descendant of ancient Illyrian. Based on shared innovations between Albanian and Messapic, Eric P. Hamp has argued that Albanian is closely related to Illyrian and not to Thracian or Daco-Moesian, maintaining that it descended from a language that was sibling of Illyrian and that was once closer to the Danube and in contact with Daco-Moesian. Due to the paucity of written evidence, what can be said with certainty in current research is that on the one hand a significant group of shared Indo-European non-Romance cognates between Albanian and Romanian indicates at least contact with the &#x27;Daco-Thraco-Moesian complex&#x27;, and that on the other hand there is some evidence to argue that Albanian is descended from the &#x27;Illyrian complex&#x27;. From a &quot;genealogical standpoint&quot;, Messapic is the closest at least partially attested language to Albanian. Hyllested &amp; Joseph (2022) label this Albanian-Messapic branch as &quot;Illyric&quot; and in agreement with recent bibliography identify Greco-Phrygian as the IE branch closest to the Albanian-Messapic one. These two branches form an areal grouping - which is often called &quot;Balkan IE&quot; - with Armenian.

==== Baltic languages ====
There is significant evidence of at least a long-term proximity link, and possibly a genetic link, between Dacian and the modern Baltic languages. The Bulgarian linguist Ivan Duridanov, in his first publication claimed that Thracian and Dacian are genetically linked to the Baltic languages and in the next one he made the following classification:&quot;The Thracian language formed a close group with the Baltic (resp. Balto-Slavic), the Dacian and the &quot;Pelasgian&quot; languages. More distant were its relations with the other Indo-European languages, and especially with Greek, the Italic and Celtic languages, which exhibit only isolated phonetic similarities with Thracian; the Tokharian and the Hittite were also distant.&quot;Duridanov&#x27;s cognates of the reconstructed Dacian words are found mostly in the Baltic languages, followed by Albanian without considering Thracian. Parallels have enabled linguists, using the techniques of comparative linguistics, to decipher the meanings of several Dacian and Thracian placenames with, they claim, a high degree of probability. Of 74 Dacian placenames attested in primary sources and considered by Duridanov, a total of 62 have Baltic cognates, most of which were rated &quot;certain&quot; by Duridanov. Polomé considers that these parallels are unlikely to be coincidence. Duridanov&#x27;s explanation is that proto-Dacian and proto-Thracian speakers were in close geographical proximity with proto-Baltic speakers for a prolonged period, perhaps during the period 3000–2000 BC. A number of scholars such as the Russian Topоrov have pointed to the many close parallels between Dacian and Thracian placenames and those of the Baltic language-zone – Lithuania, Latvia and in East Prussia (where an extinct but well-documented Baltic language, Old Prussian, was spoken until it was displaced by German during the Middle Ages).

After creating a list of names of rivers and personal names with a high number of parallels, the Romanian linguist Mircea M. Radulescu classified the Daco-Moesian and Thracian as Baltic languages of the south and also proposed such classification for Illyrian. The German linguist Schall also attributed a southern Baltic classification to Dacian. The American linguist Harvey Mayer refers to both Dacian and Thracian as Baltic languages. He claims to have sufficient evidence for classifying them as Baltoidic or at least &quot;Baltic-like,&quot; if not exactly, Baltic dialects or languages and classifies Dacians and Thracians as &quot;Balts by extension&quot;. According to him, Albanian, the descendant of Illyrian, escaped any heavy Baltic influence of Daco-Thracian. Mayer claims that he extracted an unambiguous evidence for regarding Dacian and Thracian as more tied to Lithuanian than to Latvian. The Czech archaeologist Kristian Turnvvald classified Dacian as Danubian Baltic. The Venezuelan-Lithuanian historian Jurate de Rosales classifies Dacian and Thracian as Baltic languages.

It appears from the study of hydronyms (river and lake names) that Baltic languages once predominated much farther eastwards and southwards than their modern confinement to the southeastern shores of the Baltic sea, and included regions that later became predominantly Slavic-speaking. The zone of Baltic hydronyms extends along the Baltic coast from the mouth of the Oder as far as Riga, eastwards as far as the line Yaroslavl–Moscow–Kursk and southwards as far as the line Oder mouth–Warsaw–Kyiv–Kursk: it thus includes much of northern and eastern Poland, Belarus and central European Russia.

=== Dacian as an Italic language ===
Another theory maintains that the Dacians spoke a language akin to Latin and that the people who settled in the Italian Peninsula shared the same ancestors.

The Romanian philologist Nicolae Densușianu argued in his book &quot;Dacia Preistorică&quot; (Prehistoric Dacia), published in 1913, that Latin and Dacian were the same language or were mutually intelligible. His work was considered by mainstream linguists to be pseudoscience. It was reprinted under the regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu. The first article to revive Densușianu&#x27;s theory was an unsigned paper, &quot;The Beginnings of the History of the Romanian People&quot;, included in &quot;Anale de istorie&quot;, a journal published by the Romanian Communist Party&#x27;s Institute of Historical and Social-Political Studies. The article claimed that the Thracian language was a pre-Romance or Latin language. Arguments used in the article include for instance the absence of interpreters between the Dacians and the Romans, as depicted on the bas-reliefs of Trajan&#x27;s column. The bibliography mentions, apart from Densușianu, the work of French academician Louis Armand, an engineer who allegedly showed that &quot;the Thraco-Dacians spoke a pre-Romance language&quot;. Similar arguments are found in Iosif Constantin Drăgan&#x27;s &quot;We, the Thracians&quot; (1976). About the same time Ion Horațiu Crișan wrote &quot;Burebista and His Age&quot; (1975). Nevertheless, the theory didn&#x27;t rise to official status under Ceaușescu&#x27;s rule.

Opinions about a hypothetical latinity of Dacian can be found in earlier authors: Sextus Rufus (Breviarum C.VIII, cf. Bocking Not, Dign. II, 6), Ovid (Trist. II, 188–189) and Horace (Odes, I, 20).

Iosif Constantin Drăgan and the New York City-based physician Napoleon Săvescu continued to support this theory and published a book entitled &quot;We Are Not Rome&#x27;s Descendants&quot;. They also published a magazine called &quot;Noi, Dacii&quot; (&quot;Us Dacians&quot;) and organised a yearly &quot;International Congress of Dacology&quot;.

Less radical theories have suggested that Dacian was either Italic or Celtic, like the speakers of those Indo-European languages in Western Europe who became Latinized and now speak Romance languages.

==Sources==

Many characteristics of the Dacian language are disputed or unknown. No lengthy texts in Dacian exist, only a few glosses and personal names in ancient Greek and Latin texts. No Dacian-language inscriptions have been discovered, except some of names in the Latin or Greek alphabet. What is known about the language derives from:
* Placenames, river-names and personal names, including the names of kings. The coin inscription KOΣON (&quot;Koson&quot;) may also be a personal name, of the king who issued the coin.
* The Dacian names of about fifty plants written in Greek and Roman sources (see List of Dacian plant names). Etymologies have been established for only a few of them.
* Substratum words found in Romanian, the language that is spoken today in most of the region once occupied by Dacian-speakers. These include about 400 words of uncertain origin. Romanian words for which a Dacian origin has been proposed include: (&quot;dragon&quot;), (&quot;cheese&quot;), (&quot;bank, shore&quot;), and (&quot;grape&quot;). However, the value of the substratum words as a source for the Dacian language is limited because there is no certainty that these are of Dacian origin. This can be seen in the &quot;Dicționar Explicativ al Limbii Române&quot; (DEX), which shows multiple possible etymologies for most of the words:
# Many of the words may not be &quot;substratum&quot; at all, as Latin etymologies have been proposed for them. These are inherently more likely than a Dacian origin, as the Romanian language is descended from Latin, not Dacian, e.g., (&quot;snail&quot;) may derive from Latin /proto-Romance *&quot;limace&quot; (cf. It. ), by metathesis of &quot;m&quot; with &quot;l&quot;.
# Some may derive from other little-known ancient languages at some time spoken in Dacia or Moesia: for example, the Iranian Sarmatian, or the Turkic Pannonian Avar, Bulgar or Cuman languages, or, conceivably, some unknown pre-Indo-European language(s) of the Carpathians or Balkans. An illustration of the latter possibility are pre-Indo-European substratum (i.e., Iberian/Basque) in Spanish, e.g., &quot;fox&quot; = , from Basque , instead of proto-Romance *&quot;vulpe&quot;. A pre-Indo-European origin has been proposed for several Romanian substratum words, e.g., , (&quot;fir-tree&quot;).
# About 160 of the Romanian substratum words have cognates in Albanian. A possible example is Romanian (&quot;fir-tree&quot;), Alb. cognate (same meaning). Duridanov has reconstructed *&quot;skuia&quot; as a Dacian word for fir-tree.
# The numerous Romanian substratum words that have cognates in Bulgarian may derive from Thracian, which may have been a different language from Dacian (see below, Thracian).

 (&quot;dragon&quot;), ascribed a Dacian origin by some scholars, exemplifies the etymological uncertainties. According to DEX, has also been identified as: a pre-Indo-European relic; or derived from Latin or (&quot;beast&quot; cf. It. ), or ancient Greek (&quot;monster&quot;); or as a cognate of Alb. (&quot;water-snake&quot;). DEX argues that these etymologies, save the Albanian one, are dubious, but they are no more so than the unverifiable assertion that is derived from an unknown Dacian word.

The substratum words have been used, in some cases, to corroborate Dacian words reconstructed from place- and personal names, e.g., Dacian * = &quot;white&quot; (from personal name &quot;Balius&quot;), Romanian = &quot;white-haired&quot; However, even in this case, it cannot be determined with certainty whether the Romanian word derives from the presumed Dacian word or from its Old Slavic cognate &quot;belu&quot;.

==Geographical extent==

===Linguistic area===
Dacian was probably one of the major languages of south-eastern Europe, spoken in the area between the Danube, Northern Carpathians, the Dnister River and the Balkans, and the Black Sea shore. According to historians, as a result of the linguistic unity of the Getae and Dacians that are found in the records of ancient writers Strabo, Cassius Dio, Trogus Pompeius, Appian, and Pliny the Elder, contemporary historiography often uses the term Geto-Dacians to refer to the people living in the area between the Carpathians, the Haemus (Balkan) Mountains, the Black Sea, Dnister River, Northern Carpathians, and middle Danube. Strabo gave more specific information, recording that &quot;the Dacians speak the same language as the Getae&quot; a dialect of the Thracian language. The information provided by the Greek geographer is complemented by other literary, linguistic, and archaeological evidence. Accordingly, the Geto-Dacians may have occupied territory in the west and north-west, as far as Moravia and the middle Danube, to the area of present-day Serbia in the south-west, and as far as the Haemus Mountains (Balkans) in the south. The eastern limit of the territory inhabited by the Geto-Dacians may have been the shore of the Black Sea and the Tyras River (Dnister), possibly at times reaching as far as the Bug River, the northern limit including the Trans-Carpathian westernmost Ukraine and southern Poland.

Over time, some peripheral areas of the Geto-Dacians&#x27; territories were affected by the presence of other people, such as the Celts in the west, the Illyrians in the south-west, the Greeks and Scythians in the east and the Bastarnae in the north-east. Nevertheless, between the Danube River (West), the Haemus Mountains (S), the Black Sea (E), the Dniester River (NE) and the northern Carpathians, a continuous Geto-Dacian presence as majority was permanently maintained, according to some scholars. According to the Bulgarian linguist Georgiev, the Daco-Mysian region included Dacia (approximately contemporary Romania and Hungary east of the Tisza River, Mysia (Moesia) and Scythia Minor (contemporary Dobrogea).

===Chronology===
====1st century BC====
In 53 BC, Julius Caesar stated that the lands of the Dacians started on the eastern edge of the Hercynian Forest. This corresponds to the period between 82 and 44 BC, when the Dacian state reached its widest extent during the reign of King Burebista: in the west it may have extended as far as the middle Danube River valley in present-day Hungary, in the east and north to the Carpathians in present-day Slovakia and in the south to the lower Dniester valley in present-day south-western Ukraine and the western coast of the Black Sea as far as Appollonia. At that time, some scholars believe, the Dacians built a series of hill-forts at Zemplin (Slovakia), Mala Kopania (Ukraine), Oncești, Maramureș (Romania) and Solotvyno (Ukraine). The Zemplin settlement appears to belong to a Celto-Dacian horizon, as well as the river &quot;Patissus&quot; (Tisa)&#x27;s region, including its upper stretch, according to Shchukin (1989). According to Parducz (1956) Foltiny (1966), Dacian archaeological finds extend to the west of Dacia, and occur along both banks of the Tisza. Besides the possible incorporation of a part of Slovakia into the Dacian state of Burebista, there was also Geto-Dacian penetration of south-eastern Poland, according to Mielczarek (1989). The Polish linguist Milewski Tadeusz (1966 and 1969) suggests that in the southern regions of Poland appear names that are unusual in northern Poland, possibly related to Dacian or Illyrian names. On the grounds of these names, it has been argued that the region of the Carpathian and Tatra Mountains was inhabited by Dacian tribes linguistically related to the ancestors of modern Albanians.

Also, a formal statement by Pliny indicated the river Vistula as the western boundary of Dacia, according to Nicolet (1991). Between the Prut and the Dniester, the northern extent of the appearance of Geto-Dacian elements in the 4th century BC coincides roughly with the extent of the present-day Republic of Moldova, according to Mielczarek.

According to Müllenhoff (1856), Schütte (1917), Urbańczyk (2001) and Matei-Popescu (2007), Agrippa&#x27;s commentaries mention the river Vistula as the western boundary of Dacia. Urbańczyk (1997) speculates that according to Agrippa&#x27;s commentaries, and the map of Agrippa (before 12 BC), the Vistula river separated Germania and Dacia. This map is lost and its contents are unknown However, later Roman geographers, including Ptolemy (AD 90 – c. AD 168) (II.10, III.7) and Tacitus (AD 56 – AD 117) considered the Vistula as the boundary between Germania and Sarmatia Europaea, or Germania and Scythia.

====1st century AD====
Around 20 AD, Strabo wrote the &quot;Geographica&quot; that provides information regarding the extent of regions inhabited by the Dacians. On its basis, Lengyel and Radan (1980), Hoddinott (1981) and Mountain (1998) consider that the Geto-Dacians inhabited both sides of the Tisza river before the rise of the Celtic Boii and again after the latter were defeated by the Dacians. The hold of the Dacians between the Danube and the Tisza appears to have been tenuous. However, the Hungarian archaeologist Parducz (1856) argued for a Dacian presence west of the Tisza dating from the time of Burebista. According to Tacitus (AD 56 – AD 117) Dacians were bordering Germany in the south-east while Sarmatians bordered it in the east.

In the 1st century AD, the Iazyges settled in the west of Dacia, on the plain between the Danube and the Tisza rivers, according to some scholars&#x27; interpretation of Pliny&#x27;s text: &quot;The higher parts between the Danube and the Hercynian Forest (Black Forest) as far as the winter quarters of Pannonia at Carnuntum and the plains and level country of the German frontiers there are occupied by the Sarmatian Iazyges, while the Dacians whom they have driven out hold the mountains and forests as far as the river Theiss&quot;.

Archaeological sources indicate that the local Celto-Dacian population retained its specificity as late as the 3rd century AD. Archaeological finds dated to the 2nd century AD, after the Roman conquest, indicate that during that period, vessels found in some of the Iazygian cemeteries reveal fairly strong Dacian influence, according to Mocsy. M. Párducz (1956) and Z. Visy (1971) reported a concentration of Dacian-style finds in the Cris-Mures-Tisza region and in the Danube bend area near Budapest. These maps of finds remain valid today, but they have been complemented with additional finds that cover a wider area, particularly the interfluvial region between the Danube and Tisza. However, this interpretation has been invalidated by late 20th-century archaeology, which has discovered Sarmatian settlements and burial sites all over the Hungarian Plain on both sides of the Tisza, e.g., Gyoma in south-eastern Hungary and Nyiregyhaza in north-eastern Hungary. The &quot;Barrington Atlas&quot; shows the Iazyges occupying both sides of Tisza (map 20).

====2nd century AD====
Written a few decades after the Roman conquest of Dacia 105–106 AD, Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; defined the boundaries of Dacia. There is a consensus among scholars that Ptolemy&#x27;s Dacia was the region between the rivers Tisza, Danube, upper Dniester, and Siret. The mainstream of historians accepted this interpretation: Avery (1972) Berenger (1994) Fol (1996) Mountain (1998), Waldman Mason (2006). Ptolemy also provided Dacian toponyms in the Upper Vistula (Polish: Wisła) river basin in Poland: Susudava and Setidava (with a manuscript variant Getidava. This may be an echo of Burebista&#x27;s expansion. It appears that this northern expansion of the Dacian language as far as the Vistula river lasted until 170–180 AD when the Hasdings, a Germanic tribe, expelled a Dacian group from this region, according to Schütte (1917) and Childe (1930). This Dacian group is associated by Schütte (1952) with towns having the specific Dacian language ending &#x27;dava&#x27; i.e. Setidava. A previous Dacian presence that ended with the Hasdings&#x27; arrival is considered also by who says that the Hasdings Vandals &quot;attempted to take control of lands which had previously belonged to a free Dacian group called the Costoboci&quot; Several tribes on the northern slopes of the Carpathians were mentioned that are generally considered Thraco-Dacian, i.e. Arsietae (Upper Vistula), Biessi / Biessoi and Piengitai. Schütte (1952) associated the Dacian tribe of Arsietae with the Arsonion town. The ancient documents attest names with the Dacian name ending &quot;-dava&quot; &#x27;town&#x27; in the Balto-Slavic territory, in the country of Arsietae tribe, at the sources of the Vistula river. The Biessi inhabited the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, which on Ptolemy&#x27;s map are located on the headwaters of the Dnister and Sian Rivers, the right-bank Carpathian tributary of the Vistula river. The Biessi (Biessoi) probably left their name to the mountain chain of Bieskides that continues the Carpathian Mountains towards the north (Schütte 1952). Ptolemy (140 AD) lists only Germanic or Balto-Slavic tribes, and no Dacians,on both sides of the Vistula (ref: II.10; III.7), as does the &quot;Barrington Atlas&quot; (map 19).

After the Marcomannic Wars (166–180 AD), Dacian groups from outside Roman Dacia had been set in motion, and thus were the 12,000 Dacians &quot;from the neighbourhood of Roman Dacia sent away from their own country&quot;. Their native country could have been the Upper Tisza region but other places cannot be excluded.

===Dacian linguistic zone in the early Roman imperial era (30 BC – AD 100)===
====Historical linguistic overview====
Mainstream scholarship believes the Dacian language had become established as the predominant language north of the Danube in Dacia well before 1000 BC and south of the river, in Moesia, before 500 BC.

Starting around 400 BC, Celtic groups, moving out of their La Tène cultural heartland in southern Germany/eastern Gaul, penetrated and settled south-eastern Europe as far as the Black Sea and into Anatolia. By c. 250 BC, much of the modern states of Austria, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, and Bessarabia and Moesia, were under Celtic cultural influence and probably political domination in many regions. This migratory process brought Celtic material culture, especially advanced in metallurgy, to the Illyrian and Dacian tribes. Especially intensive Celtic settlement, as evidenced by concentrations of La Tène-type cemeteries, took place in Austria, Slovakia, the Hungarian Plain, Transylvania, Bessarabia and eastern Thrace. Central Transylvania appears to have become a Celtic enclave or unitary kingdom, according to Batty. It is likely that during the period of Celtic pre-eminence, the Dacian language was eclipsed by Celtic dialects in Transylvania. In Moesia, South of the Danube, there was also extensive Celticisation. An example is the Scordisci tribe of Moesia Superior, reported by the ancient historian Livy to be Celtic-speaking and whose culture displays Celtic features.

By 60 BC, Celtic political hegemony in the region appears to have collapsed, and the indigenous Dacian tribes throughout the region appear to have reasserted their identity and political independence. This process may have been partly due to the career of the Getan king Burebista (ruled ca 80 – 44 BC), who appears to have coalesced several Getic and Dacian tribes under his leadership. It is likely that in this period, the Dacian language regained its former predominance in Transylvania.

In 29–26 BC, Moesia was conquered and annexed by the Romans. There followed an intensive process of Romanisation. The Danube, as the new frontier of the empire and main fluvial supply route for the Roman military, was soon dotted with forts and supply depots, which were garrisoned by several legions and many auxiliary units. Numerous colonies of Roman army veterans were established. The presence of the Roman military resulted in a huge influx of non-Dacian immigrants, such as soldiers, their dependents, ancillary workers and merchants, from every part of the Roman Empire, especially from the rest of the Balkans, into Moesia. It is likely that by the time the emperor Trajan invaded Dacia (101–6), the Dacian language had been largely replaced by Latin in Moesia.

The conquest of Dacia saw a similar process of Romanisation north of the Danube, so that by 200 AD, Latin was probably predominant in the zone permanently occupied by the Romans. In addition, it appears that some unoccupied parts of the dava zone were overrun, either before or during the Dacian Wars, by Sarmatian tribes; for example, eastern Wallachia, which had fallen under the Roxolani by 68 AD. By around 200 AD, it is likely that the Dacian language was confined to those parts of the dava zone occupied by the Free Dacian groups, which may have amounted to little more than the eastern Carpathians.

Under the emperor Aurelian (r. 270–275), the Romans withdrew their administration and armed forces, and possibly a significant proportion of the provincial population, from the part of Dacia they ruled. The subsequent linguistic status of this region is disputed. Traditional Romanian historiography maintains that a Latin-speaking population persisted into medieval times, to form the basis of today&#x27;s Romanian-speaking inhabitants. But this hypothesis lacks evidential basis (e.g., the absence of any post-275 Latin inscriptions in the region, other than on imported Roman coins/artefacts). What is certain is that by AD 300, the entire North Danubian region had fallen under the political domination of Germanic-speaking groups, a hegemony that continued until c. AD 500: the Goths held overall hegemony, and under them, lesser Germanic tribes such as the Taifali and Gepids. Some historians consider that the region became Germanic-speaking during this period. At least one part, Wallachia, may have become Slavic-speaking by AD 600, as it is routinely referred to &quot;Sklavinía&quot; (Greek for &quot;Land of the Slavs&quot;) by contemporary Byzantine chroniclers. The survival of the Dacian language in this period is impossible to determine, due to a complete lack of documentation. However, it is generally believed that the language was extinct by AD 600.

====Dacia and Moesia: zone of toponyms ending in &quot;-dava&quot;====
At the start of the Roman imperial era (30 BC), the Dacian language was probably predominant in the ancient regions of Dacia and Moesia (although these regions probably contained several enclaves of Celtic and Germanic speakers). Strabo&#x27;s statement that the Moesian people spoke the same language as the Dacians and Getae is consistent with the distribution of placenames, attested in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot;, which carry the Dacian suffix &quot;-dava&quot; (&quot;town&quot; or &quot;fort&quot;).

North of the Danube, the dava-zone is largely consistent with Ptolemy&#x27;s definition of Dacia&#x27;s borders (III.8.1–3) i.e. the area contained by the river &quot;Ister&quot; (Danube) to the south, the river &quot;Thibiscum&quot; (Timiș) to the west, the upper river &quot;Tyras&quot; (Dniester) to the north and the river &quot;Hierasus&quot; (Siret) to the east. To the west, it appears that the &quot;-dava&quot; placenames in Olteanu&#x27;s map lie within the line of the Timiş, extended northwards. However, four davas are located beyond the Siret, Ptolemy&#x27;s eastern border. But three of these, &quot;Piroboridava&quot;, &quot;Tamasidava&quot; and &quot;Zargidava&quot;, are described by Ptolemy as &quot;pará&quot; (Gr.&quot;very close&quot;) to the Siret: &quot;Piroboridava&quot;, the only one securely located, was 3 km from the Siret. The location of &quot;Clepidava&quot; is uncertain: Olteanu locates it in north-east Bessarabia, but Georgiev places it further west, in south-west Ukraine, between the upper reaches of the Siret and Dniester rivers.

South of the Danube, a dialect of Dacian called &quot;Daco-Moesian&quot; was probably predominant in the region known to the Romans as Moesia, which was divided by them into the Roman provinces of Moesia Superior (roughly modern Serbia) and Moesia Inferior (modern northern Bulgaria as far as the Balkan range plus Roman Dobruja region). This is evidenced by the distribution of &quot;-dava&quot; placenames, which occur in the eastern half of Moesia Superior and all over Inferior. These regions were inhabited predominantly by tribes believed to have been Dacian-speaking, such as the Triballi, Moesi and Getae.

However, the dava-zone was not exclusively or uniformly Dacian-speaking during historical times. Significant Celtic elements survived there into the 2nd century AD: Ptolemy (III.8.3) lists two Celtic peoples, the Taurisci and Anartes, as resident in the northernmost part of Dacia, in the northern Carpathians. The partly Celtic Bastarnae are also attested in this region in literature and the archaeological record during the 1st century BC; they probably remained in the 1st century AD, according to Batty.

====Other regions====
It has been argued that the zone of Dacian speech extended beyond the confines of Dacia, as defined by Ptolemy, and Moesia. An extreme view, presented by some scholars, is that Dacian was the main language spoken between the Baltic Sea and the Black and Aegean seas. But the evidence for Dacian as a prevalent language outside Dacia and Moesia appears inconclusive:

=====Republic of Moldova=====
To the east, beyond the Siret River, it has been argued by numerous scholars that Dacian was also the main language of the modern regions of Moldavia and Bessarabia, at least as far east as the river Dniester. The main evidence used to support this hypothesis consists of three &quot;-dava&quot; placenames which Ptolemy located just east of the Siret; and the mainstream identification as ethnic-Dacian of two peoples resident in Moldavia: the Carpi and Costoboci. However, the Dacian ethnicity of the Carpi and Costoboci is disputed in academic circles, and they have also been variously identified as Sarmatian, Germanic, Celtic or proto-Slavic. Numerous non-Dacian peoples, both sedentary and nomadic, the Scytho-Sarmatian Roxolani and Agathyrsi, Germanic/Celtic Bastarnae and Celtic Anartes, are attested to in the ancient sources and in the archaeological record as inhabiting this region. The linguistic status of this region during the Roman era must therefore be considered uncertain. It is likely that a great variety of languages were spoken. If there was a &quot;lingua franca&quot; spoken by all inhabitants of the region, it was not necessarily Dacian: it could as likely have been Celtic or Germanic or Sarmatian.

=====Balkans=====
To the south, it has been argued that the ancient Thracian language was a dialect of Dacian, or vice versa, and that therefore the Dacian linguistic zone extended over the Roman province of Thracia, occupying modern-day Bulgaria south of the Balkan Mountains, northern Greece and European Turkey, as far as the Aegean Sea. But this theory, based on the testimony of the Augustan-era geographer Strabo&#x27;s work &quot;Geographica&quot; VII.3.2 and 3.13, is disputed; opponents argue that Thracian was a distinct language from Dacian, either related or unrelated. (see Relationship with Thracian, below, for a detailed discussion of this issue).

=====Anatolia=====
According to some ancient sources, notably Strabo, the northwestern section of the Anatolian peninsula, namely the ancient regions of Bithynia, Phrygia and Mysia, were occupied by tribes of Thracian or Dacian origin and thus spoke dialects of the Thracian or Dacian languages (which, Strabo claimed, were in turn closely related). However, the link between Dacian and Thracian has been disputed by some scholars, as has the link between these two languages and Phrygian.

According to Strabo (VII.3.2) and Herodotus, the people of Bithynia in northwest Anatolia originated from two Thracian tribes, the &quot;Bithyni&quot; and &quot;Thyni&quot;, which migrated from their original home around the river Strymon in Thrace. Therefore, they spoke the Thracian language. In addition, Strabo (VII.3.2) claims that the neighbouring Phrygians were also descended from a Thracian tribe, the &quot;Briges&quot;, and spoke a language similar to Thracian. In fact, it has been established that both Bithynians and Phrygians spoke the Phrygian language. Phrygian is better documented than Thracian and Dacian, as some 200 inscriptions in the language survive. Study of these has led mainstream opinion to accept the observation of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (&quot;Cratylus&quot; 410a) that Phrygian showed strong affinities to Greek. Georgiev argued in one article that Phrygian originally belonged to the same IE branch as Greek and Ancient Macedonian (which did not include Thracian or Dacian), but later adopted the view that Phrygian constituted a separate branch of Indo-European, (also unrelated to Thracian or Dacian). This position is currently favoured by mainstream scholarship.

In addition, Strabo (VII.3.2) equates the Moesi people of the Danubian basin with the &quot;Mysi&quot; (Mysians), neighbours of the Phrygians in NW Anatolia, stating that the two forms were Greek and Latin variants of the same name. The Mysians, he adds, were Moesi who had migrated to Anatolia and also spoke the Dacian language. Georgiev accepts Strabo&#x27;s statement, dubbing the language of the Moesi &quot;Daco-Mysian&quot;. However, there is insufficient evidence about either Dacian or the Mysian language, both of which are virtually undocumented, to verify Strabo&#x27;s claim. It is possible that Strabo made a false identification based solely on the similarity between the two tribal names, which may have been coincidental.

=====Hungarian Plain=====
The hypothesis that Dacian was widely spoken to the north-west of Dacia is primarily based on the career of Dacian king Burebista, who ruled approximately between 80 and 44 BC. According to Strabo, Burebista coalesced the Geto-Dacian tribes under his leadership and conducted military operations as far as Pannonia and Thracia. Although Strabo appears to portray these campaigns as short-term raids for plunder and to punish his enemies, several Romanian scholars have argued, on the basis of controversial interpretation of archaeological data, that they resulted in longer-term Dacian occupation and settlement of large territories beyond the dava zone.

Some scholars have asserted that Dacian was the main language of the sedentary population of the Hungarian Plain, at least as far as the river Tisza, and possibly as far as the Danube. Statements by ancient authors such as Caesar, Strabo and Pliny the Elder have been controversially interpreted as supporting this view, but these are too vague or ambiguous to be of much geographical value. There is little hard evidence to support the thesis of a large ethnic-Dacian population on the Plain:
# Toponyms: Ptolemy (III.7.1) provides 8 placenames for the territory of the Iazyges Metanastae (i.e. the Hungarian Plain). None of these carry the Dacian &quot;-dava&quot; suffix. At least three -&quot;Uscenum&quot;, &quot;Bormanum&quot; and the only one which can be located with confidence, &quot;Partiscum&quot; (Szeged, Hungary) – have been identified as Celtic placenames by scholars.
# Archaeology: Concentrations of La Tène-type cemeteries suggest that the Hungarian Plain was the scene of heavy Celtic immigration and settlement in the period 400–260 BC (see above). During the period 100 BC – AD 100, the archaeology of the sedentary population of the Plain has been interpreted by some dated scholars as showing Dacian (Mocsy 1974) or Celto-Dacian (Parducz 1956) features. However, surveys of the results of excavations using modern scientific methods, e.g., Szabó (2005) and Almássy (2006), favour the view that the sedentary population of the Hungarian Plain in this period was predominantly Celtic and that any Dacian-style features were probably the results of trade. Of 94 contemporaneous sites excavated between 1986 and 2006, the vast majority have been identified as probably Celtic, while only two as possibly Dacian, according to Almássy, who personally excavated some of the sites. Almássy concludes: &quot;In the Great Hungarian Plain, we have to count on a sporadic Celtic village network in which the Celtic inhabitants lived mixed with the people of the Scythian Age [referring to traces of an influx of Scythians during the 1st century BC], that could have continued into the Late Celtic Period without significant changes. This system consisted of small, farm-like settlements interspersed with a few relatively large villages... In the 1st century AD nothing refers to a significant immigration of Dacian people.&quot; Visy (1995) concurs that there is little archaeological evidence of a Dacian population on the Plain before its occupation by the Sarmatians in the late 1st century AD.
# Epigraphy: Inscription AE (1905) 14 records a campaign on the Hungarian Plain by the Augustan-era general Marcus Vinucius, dated to 10 BC or 8 BC i.e. during or just after the Roman conquest of Pannonia (&quot;bellum Pannonicum&quot; 14–9 BC), in which Vinucius played a leading role as governor of the neighbouring Roman province of Illyricum. The inscription states: &quot;Marcus Vinucius...[patronymic], Consul [in 19 BC] ...[various official titles], governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the Cotini, Osi...[missing tribal name] and Anartii to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome.&quot; The inscription suggests that the population of the Hungarian Plain retained their Celtic character in the time of Augustus: the scholarly consensus is that the Cotini and Anartes were Celtic tribes and the Osi either Celts or Celticised Illyrians.

=====Slovakia=====
To the north-west, the argument has been advanced that Dacian was also prevalent in modern-day Slovakia and parts of Poland. The basis for this is the presumed Dacian occupation of the fortress of Zemplin in Slovakia in the era of Dacian king Burebista – whose campaigns outside Dacia have been dated c. 60 – 44 BC – and Ptolemy&#x27;s location of two &quot;-dava&quot; placenames on the lower Vistula River in Poland.

The hypothesis of a Dacian occupation of Slovakia during the 1st century BC is contradicted by the archaeological evidence that this region featured a predominantly Celtic culture from c. 400 BC; and a sophisticated kingdom of the Boii Celtic tribe. Based in modern-day Bratislava during the 1st century BC, this polity issued its own gold and silver coinage (the so-called &quot;Biatec-type&quot; coins), which bear the names of several kings with recognised Celtic names. This kingdom is also evidenced by numerous Celtic-type fortified hill-top settlements (&quot;oppida&quot;), of which Zemplin is the foremost example in south-east Slovakia. Furthermore, the archaeological Puchov culture, present in Slovakia in this period, is considered Celtic by mainstream scholars. Some scholars argue that Zemplin was occupied by Burebista&#x27;s warriors from about 60 BC onwards, but this is based on the presence of Dacian-style artefacts alongside the Celtic ones, which may simply have been cultural imports. But even if occupation by Dacian troops under Burebista actually occurred, it would probably have been brief, as in 44 BC Burebista died and his kingdom collapsed and split into 4 fragments. In any case, it does not follow that the indigenous population became Dacian-speakers during the period of Dacian control. Karol Pieta&#x27;s discussion of the ethnicity of the Puchov people shows that opinion is divided between those who attribute the culture to a Celtic group – the Boii or Cotini are the leading candidates – and those who favour a Germanic group, e.g., the Buri. Despite wide acknowledgement of Dacian influence, there is little support for the view that the people of this region were ethnic Dacians.

=====Poland=====
The hypothesis of a substantial Dacian population in the river Vistula basin is not widely supported among modern scholars, as this region is generally regarded as inhabited predominantly by Germanic tribes during the Roman imperial era, e.g., Heather (2009).

=== The fate of Dacian ===
From the earliest times that they are attested, Dacians lived on both sides of Danube and on both sides of the Carpathians, evidenced by the northern Dacian town Setidava. It is unclear exactly when the Dacian language became extinct, or whether it has a living descendant. The first Roman conquest of part of Dacia did not extinguish the language, as Free Dacian tribes may have continued to speak Dacian in the area north-east of the Carpathians as late as the 6th or 7th century AD. According to one hypothesis, a branch of Dacian continued as the Albanian language (Hasdeu, 1901). Another hypothesis (Marius A.) considers Albanian to be a Daco-Moesian dialect that split off from Dacian before 300 BC and that Dacian itself became extinct. However, mainstream scholarship considers Albanian to be a descendant of the Illyrian language and not a dialect of Dacian. In this scenario, Albanian/Romanian cognates are either Daco-Moesian loanwords acquired by Albanian, or, more likely, Illyrian loanwords/substrate words acquired by Romanian.

The argument for a split before 300 BC is that inherited Albanian words (e.g. Alb &quot;motër&quot; &#x27;sister&#x27; &lt; Late IE *&quot;ma:ter&quot; &#x27;mother&#x27;) show the transformation Late IE /aː/ &gt; Alb /o/, but all the Latin loans in Albanian having an /aː/ show Latin /aː/ &gt; Alb a. This indicates that the transformation PAlb /aː/ &gt; PAlb /o/ happened and ended before the Roman arrival in the Balkans. However, Romanian substratum words shared with Albanian show a Romanian /a/ that corresponds to an Albanian /o/ when the source of both sounds is an original common /aː/ (&quot;mazăre / modhull&quot; &lt; *&quot;maːdzula&quot; &#x27;pea&#x27;, &quot;rață / rosë&quot; &lt; *&quot;raːtjaː&quot; &#x27;duck&#x27;), indicating that when these words had the same common form in Pre-Romanian and Proto-Albanian, the transformation PAlb /aː/ &gt; PAlb /o/ had not yet begun. The correlation between these two theories indicates that the hypothetical split between the pre-Roman Dacians, who were later Romanised, and Proto-Albanian happened before the Romans arrived in the Balkans.

==== Extinction ====
According to Georgiev, Daco-Moesian was replaced by Latin as the everyday language in some parts of the two Moesiae during the Roman imperial era, but in others, for instance Dardania in modern-day southern Serbia and northern North Macedonia, Daco-Moesian remained dominant, although heavily influenced by eastern Balkan Latin. The language may have survived in remote areas until the 6th century. Thracian, also supplanted by Latin, and by Greek in its southern zone, is documented as a living language in approximately 500 AD.

== Sound changes from Proto-Indo-European ==
Phonologically Dacian is a conservative Indo-European (IE) language. From the remaining fragments, the sound changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Dacian can be grouped as follows:

===Short vowels===
# PIE *a and *o appear as a.
# PIE accented *e, appears as ye in open syllable or ya in closed ones. Otherwise, PIE un-accented *e remains e.
# PIE *i was preserved in Dacian as i.

===Long vowels===
# PIE *ē and *ā appear as *ā
# PIE *ō was preserved as *ō

===Diphthongs===
# PIE *ai was preserved as *ai
# PIE *oi appears in Dacian as *ai
# PIE *ei evolution is not well reconstructed yet. It appears to be preserved to ei or that already passed to i.
# PIE *wa was preserved as *wa.
# PIE *wo appears as *wa.
# PIE *we was preserved as *we.
# PIE *wy appears as *vi.
# PIE *aw was preserved as *aw.
# PIE *ow appears as *aw.
# PIE *ew was preserved as *ew.

===Consonants===
Like many IE stocks, Dacian merged the two series of voiced stops.
# Both *d and *dh became d,
# Both *g and *gh became g
# Both *b and *bh became b
# PIE *ḱ became ts
# PIE *ǵ became dz
# PIE *kʷ when followed by e, i became t̠ʃ. Otherwise became k. Same fate for PIE cluster *kw.
# PIE *gʷ and *gʷh when followed by e or i became d̠ʒ. Otherwise became g. Same fate for PIE cluster *gw
# PIE *m, *n, *p, *t, *r, *l were preserved.

Note: In the course of the diachronic development of Dacian, a palatalisation of k and g appears to have occurred before front vowels according to the following process
* k &gt; or &gt; , e.g.: *ker(s)na is reflected by Tierna (Tabula Peutingeriana) Dierna (in inscriptions and Ptolemy), *Tsierna in station Tsiernen[sis], AD 157, Zernae (notitia Dignitatum), (colonia) Zernensis (Ulpian)
* g &gt; , e.g.: Germisara appears as Γερμιζερα, with the variants Ζερμιζίργα, Ζερμίζιργα

==Vocabulary==
===Place names===
Ptolemy gives a list of 43 names of towns in Dacia, out of which arguably 33 were of Dacian origin. Most of the latter included the suffix &#x27;dava&#x27;, meaning settlement or village. But, other Dacian names from his list lack the suffix, for example Zarmisegethusa regia = Zermizirga, and nine other names of Dacian origin seem to have been Latinised.

The Dacian linguistic area is characterised mainly with composite names ending in -dava, or variations such as -deva, -daua, -daba, etc. The settlement names ending in these suffixes are geographically grouped as follows:
* In Dacia: Acidava, Argedava, Argidava, Buridava, Cumidava, Dokidaua, Karsidaua, Klepidaua, Markodaua, Netindaua, Patridaua, Pelendova, *Perburidava, Petrodaua, Piroboridaua, Rhamidaua, Rusidava, Sacidaba, Sangidaua, Setidava, Singidaua, Sykidaba, Tamasidaua, Utidaua, Zargidaua, Ziridava, Zucidaua – 26 names altogether.
* In Lower Moesia (the present northern Bulgaria) and Scythia Minor (Dobruja): Aedabe, *Buteridava, *Giridava, Dausdavua, Kapidaua, Murideba, Sacidava, Scaidava (Skedeba), Sagadava, Sukidaua (Sucidava) – 10 names in total.
* In Upper Moesia (the present districts of Nish, Sofia, and partly Kjustendil): Aiadaba, Bregedaba, Danedebai, Desudaba, Itadeba, Kuimedaba, Zisnudeba – 7 names in total.

Besides these regions, similar village names are found in three other places:
* Thermi-daua (Ptolemy), a town in Dalmatia, a Grecised form of *Germidava. This settlement was probably founded by immigrants from Dacia.
* Gil-doba – a village in Thrace, of unknown location.
* Pulpu-deva in Thrace – today Plovdiv in Bulgaria.

A number of Dacian settlements do not have the -dava ending or variant suffix. Some of these are: Acmonia, Aizis, Amutria, Apulon, Arcina, Arcobadara, Arutela, Berzobis, Brucla, Diacum, Dierna, Dinogetia, Drobeta, Egeta, Genucla, Malva (Romula), Napoca, Oescus, Patruissa, Pinon, Potaissa, Ratiaria, Sarmizegetusa, Tapae, Tibiscum, Tirista, Tsierna, Tyrida, Zaldapa, Zeugma and Zurobara.

===Tribal names===
In the case of Ptolemy&#x27;s Dacia, most of the tribal names are similar to those on the list of civitates, with few exceptions. Georgiev counts the Triballi, the Moesians and the Dardanians as Daco-Moesians.

===Plant names===


In ancient literary sources, the Dacian names for a number of medicinal plants and herbs survive in ancient texts, including about 60 plant names in Dioscorides. The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides, of Anazarbus in Asia Minor, wrote the medical textbook &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; () in the mid-1st century AD. In Wellmann&#x27;s opinion (1913), accepted by Russu (1967), the Dacian plant names were added in the 3rd century AD from a glossary published by the Greek grammarian Pamphilus of Alexandria (1st century AD). The Dacian glosses were probably added to the Pseudo-Apuleius texts by the 4th century. The mixture of indigenous Dacian, Latin and Greek words in the lists of Dacian plant names may be explained by a linguistic crossing process occurring in that period.

Although many Dacian toponyms have uncertain meanings, they are more reliable as sources of Dacian words than the names of medicinal plants provided by Dioscorides, which have led to speculative identifications: out of 57 plants, 25 identifications may be erroneous, according to Asher &amp; Simpson. According to the Bulgarian linguist Decev, of the 42 supposedly Dacian plant names in Dioscorides only 25 are truly Dacian, while 10 are Latin and 7 Greek. Also, of the 31 &quot;Dacian&quot; plant names recorded by Pseudo-Apuleius, 16 are really Dacian, 9 are Latin and 8 are Greek.

Examples of common Dacian, Latin and Greek words in Pseudo-Apuleius:
* Dacian &quot;blis&quot; and Latin &quot;blitum&quot; (from Greek &quot;bliton&quot; for purple amaranth
* Dacian &quot;amolusta&quot; and Campanian &quot;amolocia&quot; for chamomile
* Dacian &quot;dracontos&quot; and Italic &quot;dracontes&quot; for rosemary

===Reconstruction of Dacian words===
Both Georgiev and Duridanov use the comparative linguistic method to decipher ancient Thracian and Dacian names, respectively. Georgiev (1977) argues that the meaning of an ancient placename in an unknown language can be deciphered by comparing it to its successor-names and to cognate placenames and words in other Indo-European languages, both ancient and modern. Georgiev considers decipherment by analysis of root-words alone to be devoid of scientific value. He gives several examples of his methodology, one of which refers to a town and river (a tributary of the Danube) in eastern Romania called Cernavodă, which in Slavic means &quot;black water&quot;. The same town in antiquity was known as &quot;Ἀξίοπα&quot; (&quot;Axiopa&quot;) or &quot;Ἀξιούπολις&quot; (&quot;Axioupolis&quot;) and its river as the &quot;Ἀξιός&quot; (&quot;Axios&quot;). The working assumption is that &quot;Axiopa&quot; meant &quot;black water&quot; in Dacian, on the basis that Cernavodă is probably a calque of the ancient Dacian name. According to Georgiev, the likely IE root-word for &quot;Axios&quot; is *&quot;n̥-ks(e)y-no&quot; (&quot;dark, black&quot; cf. Avestan &quot;axsaena&quot;). On the basis of the known rules of formation of IE composite words, Axiopa would break down as &quot;axi&quot; = &quot;black&quot; and &quot;opa&quot; or &quot;upa&quot; = &quot;water&quot; in Dacian; the &quot;-polis&quot; element is ignored, as it is a Greek suffix meaning &quot;city&quot;. The assumption is then validated by examining cognate placenames. There was another Balkan river also known in antiquity as &quot;Axios&quot;, whose source was in the Dacian-speaking region of Moesia: its modern Macedonian name is &quot;Crna reka&quot; (Slavic for &quot;black river&quot;): although it was in Dardania (Rep. of North Macedonia), a mainly Illyrian-speaking region. Georgiev considers this river-name to be of Daco-Moesian origin. The &quot;axi&quot; element is also validated by the older Greek name for the Black Sea, &quot;Ἄξεινος πόντος&quot; – &quot;Axeinos pontos&quot;, later altered to the euphemism Εὔξεινος πόντος &quot;Euxeinos pontos&quot; meaning &quot;Hospitable sea&quot;. The &quot;opa/upa&quot; element is validated by the Lithuanian cognate &quot;upė&quot;, meaning &quot;water&quot;). The second component of the town&#x27;s name *&quot;-upolis&quot; may be a diminutive of *&quot;upa&quot; cf. Lithuanian diminutive &quot;upelis&quot;.

[N.B. This etymology was questioned by Russu: &quot;Axiopa&quot;, a name attested to only in Procopius&#x27; &quot;De Aedificiis&quot;, may be a corrupted form of &quot;Axiopolis&quot;. However, even if correct, Russu&#x27;s objection is irrelevant: it does not affect the interpretation of the &quot;axi-&quot; element as meaning &quot;black&quot;, or the &quot;upa&quot; as meaning &quot;water&quot; cf. placename &quot;Scenopa&quot;. Fraser (1959) noted that the root &quot;axio&quot; that occurs in the place-name &quot;Axiopa&quot; is also found in Samothrace and in Sparta, where Athena Axiopoina was worshiped. Therefore, he considers this pre-Greek root to be of Thracian origin, meaning &quot;great&quot;. However, there is no certainty that the &quot;axi&quot; element in Greece was of Thracian (as opposed to Greek or other language), or that it meant &quot;great&quot; rather than &quot;black&quot;. In any case, this objection may not be relevant, if Thracian was a separate language to Dacian].

Some linguists are skeptical of this reconstruction methodology of Dacian. The phonetic systems of Dacian and Thracian and their evolution are not reconstructed directly from indigenous elements but from their approximative Greek or Latin transcripts. Greek and Latin had no dedicated graphic signs for phonemes such as č, ġ, ž, š and others. Thus, if a Thracian or Dacian word contained such a phoneme, a Greek or Latin transcript would not represent it accurately. The etymologies that are adduced to back up the proposed Dacian and Thracian vowel and consonant changes, used for word reconstruction with the comparative method, are open to divergent interpretations because the material is related to place names, with the exception of Dacian plant names and the limited number of glosses. Because of this, there are divergent and even contradictory assumptions for the phonological structure and development of the Dacian and Thracian languages. It is doubtful that the Dacian phonological system has been accurately reproduced by Greek or Latin transcripts of indigenous lexica.

In the case of personal names, the choice of the etymology is often a matter of compliance with assumed phonological rules. Since the geographical aspect of the occurrence of sound changes (i.e. o &gt; a) within Thracian territory, based on the work of V. Georgiev, began to be emphasised by some researchers, the chronological aspect has been somewhat neglected. There are numerous cases where lack of information has obscured the vocalism of these idioms, generating the most contradictory theories. Today, some 3,000 Thraco-Dacian lexical units are known. In the case of the oscillation *o / *a, the total number of words containing it is about 30, many more than the ones cited by both Georgiev and Russu, and the same explanation is not valid for all of them.

In 2024, Robert Eggers&#x27; remake of Nosferatu utilized Dacian in several instances of Count Orlok&#x27;s dialogue (played by Bill Skarsgård). This was done with the consultation of Romanian screenwriter Florin Lăzărescu.

<text>Stephen Watts Kearny (sometimes spelled Kearney) ( ) (August 30, 1794October 31, 1848) was one of the foremost antebellum frontier officers of the United States Army. He is remembered for his significant contributions in the Mexican–American War, especially the Conquest of California. The Kearny Code, proclaimed on September 22, 1846, in Santa Fe, established the law and government of the newly acquired territory of New Mexico and was named after him. His nephew was Major General Philip Kearny of American Civil War fame.

==Early years==
Stephen Watts Kearny was the fifteenth and youngest child of Philip and Susanna Watts Kearny. His father, who was of Irish ancestry (the family name had originally been O&#x27;Kearny), was a successful wine merchant and landowner in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, before the start of the American Revolution (1775–83). Kearny was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Philip Kearny Sr. and Susanna Watts. His maternal grandparents were the wealthy merchant Robert Watts of New York and Mary Alexander, the daughter of Major General &quot;Lord Stirling&quot; William Alexander and Sarah &quot;Lady Stirling&quot; Livingston of American Revolutionary War fame. Stephen Watts Kearny attended Columbia University in New York City for two years. He joined the New York militia as an ensign in 1812.

==Marriage and family==
In the late 1820s, after his career was established, Kearny met, courted and married Mary Radford, the stepdaughter of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The couple had eleven children, of whom six died in childhood. He was the uncle of Philip Kearny, a Union general in the American Civil War who was killed at the Battle of Chantilly.

==Career==
In 1812 Kearny was commissioned as a First Lieutenant in the War of 1812 in the 13th Infantry Regiment in the U.S. Army. On 13 October 1812 during the Battle of Queenston Heights, Kearny and Lieutenant Colonel Winfield Scott led a charge, which took the British position; but the enemy retook it, when the &quot;untrained militiamen&quot; did not reinforce the U.S. Regular&#x27;s which had taken the objective. &quot;Humiliated, Kearny and Scott were forced to surrender;&quot; wounded and prisoners, he and Scott spent several months in captivity before being paroled. But this experience would &quot;harden&quot; his prejudice against militias for the rest of his army career. Kearny was promoted to captain on April 1, 1813. After the war, he chose to remain in the US Army and was promoted to brevet major in 1823; major, 1829; and lieutenant colonel, 1833. He was assigned to the western frontier under command of Gen. Henry Atkinson, and in 1819 he was a member of the expedition to explore the Yellowstone River in present-day Montana and Wyoming. The Yellowstone Expedition of 1819 journeyed only as far as present-day Nebraska, where it established Cantonment Missouri, later renamed Fort Atkinson. Kearny was also on the 1825 expedition that reached the mouth of the Yellowstone River. During his travels, he kept extensive journals, including his interactions with Native Americans.

In 1826, Captain Kearny was appointed as the first commander of the new Jefferson Barracks in Missouri south of St. Louis. While stationed there, he was often invited to the nearby city, the center of fur trade, economics and politics of the region. By way of Meriwether Lewis Clark, Sr., he was invited as a guest of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

In 1833, Lieutenant Colonel Kearny was appointed second in command of the newly organized 1st Dragoon Regiment. The U.S. Cavalry eventually grew out of this regiment, which was re-designated the 1st United States Cavalry in 1861, earning Kearny his nickname as the &quot;father of the United States Cavalry&quot;. The regiment was stationed at Fort Leavenworth in present-day Kansas, and Kearny was promoted to the rank of colonel in command of the regiment in 1836. He was also made commander of the Army&#x27;s Third Military Department, charged with protecting the frontier and preserving peace among the tribes of Native Americans on the Great Plains.

By the early 1840s, when emigrants began traveling along the Oregon Trail, Kearny often ordered his men to escort the travelers across the plains to avoid attack by the Native Americans. The practice of the military&#x27;s escorting settlers&#x27; wagon trains would become official government policy in succeeding decades. To protect the travelers, Kearny established a new post along Table Creek near present-day Nebraska City, Nebraska. The outpost was named Fort Kearny. However, the Army realized the site was not well-chosen, and the post was moved to the present location on the Platte River in central Nebraska.

In May 1845, Kearny marched his 1st Dragoons of 15 officers and 250 men in a column of twos out the gates of Ft. Leavenworth for a nearly four-month-long reconnaissance into the Rocky Mountains and the South Pass, &quot;the gateway to Oregon.&quot; The Dragoons traveled light and fast, hauling 17 supply wagons, driving 50 sheep, and 25 beefs on the hoof (cattle). Kearny&#x27;s Dragoons covered nearly a day and upon their approach to Ft. Laramie they had traveled nearly in four weeks. &quot;Barely two weeks later Kearny and his troopers stood atop South Pass, held a regimental muster on the continental divide, and turned toward home.&quot; Marching his Dragoons down the Rocky Mountains, past the future site of Denver Colorado, then Bent&#x27;s Fort, then onto the Santa Fe Trail. When they arrived back to Ft. Leavenworth on August 24, 1845, they had successfully conducted a reconnaissance of over in 99 days. &quot;The march of the 1st dragoons was truly &quot;an outstanding example of cavalry mobility.&quot;&quot;

===Mexican–American War (1846–1848)===

At the outset of the Mexican–American War, Kearny was promoted to brigadier general on June 30, 1846, and took a force of about 2,500 men to Santa Fe, New Mexico. His Army of the West (1846) consisted of 1600 men in the volunteer First and Second Regiments of Fort Leavenworth, Missouri Mounted Cavalry regiment under Alexander Doniphan; an artillery and infantry battalion; 300 of Kearny&#x27;s 1st U.S. Dragoons (mounted infantrymen) and about 500 members of the Mormon Battalion. With this force, and due largely to the behind the scenes and coordinated efforts of U.S. President Polk, New Mexico Governor Armijo, and the American merchant James Wiley Magoffin, who had 20 years of trading experience in Mexico; Kearny was able to comply with the president&#x27;s wishes, and conquer New Mexico without firing a shot.

Kearny established a joint civil and military government, appointing Charles Bent, a prominent Santa Fe Trail trader living in Taos, New Mexico as acting civil. He divided his forces into four commands: one, under Col. Sterling Price, appointed military governor, was to occupy and maintain order in New Mexico with his approximately 800 men; a second group under Col. Alexander William Doniphan, with a little over 800 men was ordered to capture El Paso, in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico and then join up with General John E. Wool; the third command of about 300 dragoons mounted on mules, he led under his command to California along the Gila River trail. The Mormon Battalion, mostly marching on foot under Lt. Col. Philip St. George Cooke, was directed to follow Kearny with wagons to blaze a new southern wagon route to California.

On the plaza in Santa Fe, a monument marks a fateful day. Gen. Kearny had entered the city after routing the militia of New Mexico under the command of Governor Armijo and entered a city then undefended but very hostile. He marched to the plaza in front of the Palacio Real, and took down the flag of the state of New Mexico, which he thought was the flag of Mexico. In its place he hoisted the Stars and Stripes and gave the speech which is summarized on the monument. New Mexico was then a state with a democratically constituted government, which Kearny overthrew, installing in its place under the Kearny Code a military dictatorship. The next year, in 1847, three men pressed the case for the restoration of New Mexico&#x27;s statehood and its admission to the American Union: Zachary Taylor, Abraham Lincoln, and Kearny&#x27;s rival, John Charles Frémont. New Mexico&#x27;s statehood and self-government were not restored until 1912.

====California====

Kearny, per orders from President Polk, set out to &quot;conquer and take possession of California&quot; on September 25, 1846, with a force of 300 men. En route he encountered Kit Carson, a scout of John C. Frémont&#x27;s California Battalion, carrying messages back to Washington, D.C., on the status of hostilities in California. Kearny learned that California was, at the time of Carson&#x27;s last information, under American control of the marines and bluejacket sailors of Commodore Robert F. Stockton of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron and Frémont&#x27;s California Battalion. Kearny asked Carson to guide him back to California while he sent Carson&#x27;s messages east with a different courier. Kearny sent 200 dragoons back to Santa Fe believing that California was secure. After traveling almost his weary 100 dragoons and most of his nearly worn-out mounts were replaced by untrained mules purchased from a mule herder&#x27;s herd being driven to Santa Fe from California. On a trip across the Colorado Desert to San Diego Kearny encountered marine Major Archibald H. Gillespie and about 30 men with news of an ongoing Californio revolt in Los Angeles.

On a wet December 6, 1846 day Kearny&#x27;s forces encountered Andrés Pico (Californio Governor Pio Pico&#x27;s brother) and a force of about 150 Californio Lancers. With most of his men mounted on weary untrained mules, his command executed an uncoordinated attack of Pico&#x27;s force. They found most of their powder wet and pistols and carbines would not fire. They soon found their mules and cavalry sabers were poor defense against Californio Lancers mounted on well-trained horses. Kearny&#x27;s column, along with the small force of Marines and volunteer militia, suffered defeat. About 18 men of Kearny&#x27;s force were killed; retreating to a hill top to dry their powder and treat their wounded, they were surrounded by Andre Pico&#x27;s forces. Kearny was slightly wounded in this encounter, the Battle of San Pasqual. Kit Carson got through Pico&#x27;s men and returned to San Diego. Commodore Stockton sent a combined force of U.S. Marine and U.S. Navy bluejacket sailors under Capt. Archibald H. Gillespie (USMC), and Lieutenant Edward F. Beale (USN), to relieve Kearny&#x27;s column. The U.S. forces quickly drove out the Californios. In January 1847 a combined force of about 600 men consisting of Kearny&#x27;s dragoons, Stockton&#x27;s marines and sailors, and two companies of Frémont&#x27;s California Battalion won the Battle of Rio San Gabriel and the Battle of La Mesa and retook control of Los Angeles on January 10, 1847. The Californio forces in California capitulated on January 13 to Lt. Col. John C. Frémont and his California Battalion. The Treaty of Cahuenga ended the fighting of the Mexican–American War in Alta California on that date. Kearny and Stockton decided to accept the liberal terms offered by Frémont to terminate hostilities, despite Andrés Pico&#x27;s breaking his earlier, solemn pledge that he would not fight U.S. forces.

As the ranking Army officer, and per orders from President Polk, Kearny claimed command of California at the end of hostilities despite the fact that California was initially brought under U.S. control by Commodore Stockton&#x27;s, Pacific Squadron&#x27;s forces. This began an unfortunate rivalry with Stockton, whose rank was equivalent to a rear admiral (lower half) today. Stockton and Kearny had the same equivalent rank (one star) and unfortunately, the War Department had not worked out a protocol for who would be in charge. Stockton seized on the treaty of capitulation and appointed Frémont military governor of California.

In July 1846, Col. Jonathan D. Stevenson of New York was asked to raise a volunteer regiment of 10 companies of 77 men each to go to California with the understanding that they would muster out and stay in California. They were designated the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers and fought in the California Campaign and the Pacific Coast Campaign. In August 1846 and September the regiment trained and prepared for the trip to California. Three private merchant ships, &quot;Thomas H Perkins&quot;, &quot;Loo Choo&quot; and &quot;Susan Drew&quot;, were chartered, and the sloop was assigned convoy detail. On 26 September the four ships left New York for California. Fifty men who had been left behind for various reasons sailed on November 13, 1846, on the small storeship USS Brutus. The &quot;Susan Drew&quot; and &quot;Loo Choo&quot; reached Valparaíso, Chile by January 20, 1847, and after getting fresh supplies, water and wood were on their way again by January 23. The &quot;Perkins&quot; did not stop until San Francisco, reaching port on March 6, 1847. The &quot;Susan Drew&quot; arrived on March 20 and the &quot;Loo Choo&quot; arrived on March 16, 183 days after leaving New York. The &quot;Brutus&quot; finally arrived on April 17.

After desertions and deaths in transit the four ships brought 648 men to California. The companies were then deployed throughout Upper (&quot;Alta&quot;) and Lower (&quot;Baja&quot;) California from San Francisco to La Paz, Mexico. These troops finally allowed Kearny to assume command of California as ranking Army officer. The troops essentially took over all of the Pacific Squadron&#x27;s on-shore military and garrison duties and the California Battalion and Mormon Battalion&#x27;s garrison duties as well as some Baja California duties.

With all these reinforcements in hand Kearny assumed command, appointed his own territorial military governor and ordered Frémont to resign and accompany him back to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. On Kearny and Frémont&#x27;s trip back east on the California Trail, accompanied by some members of the Mormon Battalion who had re-enlisted, they found and buried some of the Donner Party&#x27;s remains on their trip over the Sierra Nevadas. Once at Fort Leavenworth, Frémont was restricted to barracks and ordered court-martialed for insubordination and willfully disregarding an order. A court martial convicted Frémont and ordered that he receive a dishonorable discharge, but President James K. Polk quickly commuted Frémont&#x27;s sentence due to services he had rendered over his career. Frémont resigned his commission in disgust and settled in California. In 1847 Frémont purchased the Rancho Las Mariposas, a large land grant in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains near Yosemite, which proved to be rich in gold. Frémont was later elected one of the first U.S. senators from California and was the first presidential candidate of the new Republican Party in 1856.

===Governorship and last years===
Kearny remained military governor of California until May 31, when he set out overland across the California Trail to Washington, D.C., and was welcomed as a hero. He was appointed governor of Veracruz, and later of Mexico City. He also received a brevet promotion to major general in September 1848, over the heated opposition of Frémont&#x27;s father-in-law, Senator Thomas Hart Benton.

After contracting yellow fever in Veracruz, Kearny had to return to St. Louis. He died there on October 31, 1848, at the age of 54. He was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, now a National Historic Landmark in St. Louis.

==Legacy and memory==

Historian Allan Nevins, examining his attacks on Frémont, states that Kearny:
:was a stern-tempered soldier who made few friends and many enemies-- who has been justly characterized by the most careful historian of the period, Justin H. Smith, as &quot;grasping, jealous, domineering, and harsh.&quot; Possessing these traits, feeling his pride stung by his defeat at San Pasqual, and anxious to assert his authority, he was no sooner in Los Angeles than he quarreled bitterly with Stockton; and Frémont was not only at once involved in this quarrel, but inherited the whole burden of it as soon as Stockton left the country. 
Kearny &quot;was simply, a professional soldier&#x27;s soldier, and he &quot;may have been the only general in the Mexican War who &quot;did not&quot; long to become president.

Kearny is the namesake of Kearny, Arizona and Kearney, Nebraska. Kearny, New Jersey near Kearny&#x27;s place of birth, is named after his nephew, Philip Kearny, Jr. of American Civil War fame. Many schools are named after Kearny, including Kearny Elementary in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Kearny High School in the San Diego neighborhood of Kearny Mesa. Kearny Street, in downtown San Francisco, is also named for him, as is a street within Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Camp Kearny in San Diego, a U.S. military base which operated from 1917 to 1946 on the site of today&#x27;s Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, was named in his honor. Fort Kearny in Nebraska is also named for him.

Two U.S. postage stamps relate to Kearny. Scott catalog number 970, printed in 1948, commemorates Fort Kearny, and number 944, issued in 1946, the capture of Santa Fe. The accuracy of the latter&#x27;s depiction has been questioned.

Actor Robert Anderson (1920–1996) played General Kearny in the 1966 episode &quot;The Firebrand&quot; of the syndicated western television series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;. Gregg Barton was cast as Commodore Robert F. Stockton, with Gerald Mohr as Andrés Pico and Will Kuluva as Pio Pico. The episode is set in 1848 with the establishment of California Territory and the tensions between the outgoing Mexican government and the incoming American governor.

Stephen W. Kearny is the default name of the United States hero unit in &quot;Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition&quot;.

<text>James Francis &quot;Pud&quot; Galvin (December 25, 1856 – March 7, 1902) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher in the 19th century. He was MLB&#x27;s first 300-game winner and was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1965.

==Baseball career==
Galvin grew up in Kerry Patch, an Irish neighborhood in St. Louis. He debuted for St. Louis of the National Association in 1875, the franchise&#x27;s inaugural season, and started eight games for the team. He spent the next seasons with Buffalo in the International Association and later of the National League. In his first full MLB season in 1879, Galvin had a win–loss record of 37–27 and a 2.28 earned run average (retroactively calculated; ERA was not an established statistic before the 20th century) in 593 innings pitched. On August 20, 1880, he became the first major league pitcher to throw a no-hitter on the road, leading his Buffalo Bisons to a 1–0 victory over the Worcester Worcesters. He pitched over 400 innings in 1880, 1881, and 1882. In 1883, Galvin went 46–29 with a 2.72 ERA, setting career highs in wins, games started (75), complete games (72), and innings pitched (656.1); he led the NL in the latter three categories. The following season, in 1884, he went 46–22 with a 1.99 ERA in 72 games started, 71 complete games, and 636.1 innings pitched.

Galvin was traded to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys midseason in 1885. He played for the Allegheny club from 1885 to 1889, pitching over 300 innings each year. He jumped to the Pittsburgh Burghers of the short-lived Players League before the 1890 season and then returned to the Alleghenys (now named the &quot;Pirates&quot;) after the season. On June 14, 1892, Galvin was traded to the St. Louis Browns. He retired after the 1892 season, though he made a brief return to Buffalo (by this time a minor league franchise) in 1894.

Galvin played in an era where two-man pitching rotations were common – hence his 6,003 innings pitched and 646 complete games, both of which are second only to the career totals of Cy Young. Upon his retirement, Galvin held all-time records in several pitching categories, including wins, innings pitched, games started, games completed and shutouts. He became MLB&#x27;s first 300-game winner in 1888. Galvin holds the record for most games started in a single season by a pitcher before 1893, 75 (tied with Will White). Galvin is the only player in baseball history to win 20 or more games in 10 different years without winning a pennant, finishing his career with a total of 365 wins and 310 losses.

The nickname &quot;Pud&quot; originated because Galvin was said to make hitters &quot;look like pudding.&quot; Galvin was also nicknamed &quot;The Little Steam Engine&quot;, a tribute to his power in spite of his small size. He was sometimes known as &quot;Gentle Jeems&quot; because of his kind disposition.

==Legacy==
Galvin died poor at age 45 on March 7, 1902, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and, as a Roman Catholic, is buried in Calvary Catholic Cemetery. He was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1965 by the Veterans Committee. In honor of his achievements in Buffalo, Galvin was inducted into the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.

A 2006 NPR article referred to Galvin as &quot;the first baseball player to be widely known for using a performance-enhancing substance.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Galvin used the Brown-Séquard elixir, which contained monkey testosterone, before a single game in 1889. However, no one seemed bothered by the use of the elixir, and the newspaper practically endorsed it after the game, saying that Galvin&#x27;s performance was &quot;the best proof yet furnished of the value of the discovery.&quot;

<text>William Roscoe (8 March 175330 June 1831) was an English banker, lawyer, and briefly a Member of Parliament. He is best known as one of England&#x27;s first abolitionists, and as the author of the poem for children &quot;The Butterfly&#x27;s Ball, and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot;. In his day he was also respected as a historian and art collector, as well as a botanist and miscellaneous writer. 

==Early life==
He was born in Liverpool, where his father, a market gardener, kept a public house called the Bowling Green at Mount Pleasant. Roscoe left school at the age of twelve, having learned all that his schoolmaster could teach. He assisted his father in the work of the garden, but spent his leisure time on reading and study. Later, he wrote:
:This mode of life gave health and vigour to my body, and amusement and instruction to my mind; and to this day I well remember the delicious sleep which succeeded my labours, from which I was again called at an early hour. If I were now asked whom I consider to be the happiest of the human race, I should answer, those who cultivate the earth by their own hands.
At fifteen he began to look for a suitable career. A month&#x27;s trial of bookselling was unsuccessful, and in 1769 he was articled to a solicitor. Although a diligent student of law, he continued to read the classics, and made the acquaintance with the language and literature of Italy which was to dominate his life.

==Career==
In 1774, he went into business as a lawyer, and in 1781 married Jane, second daughter of William Griffies, a Liverpool tradesman; they had seven sons and three daughters. Roscoe had the courage to denounce the trans-Atlantic slave trade in his native town, where, at that time, a significant amount of the wealth came from slavery. Roscoe was a prominent Unitarian. His outspokenness against the slave trade meant that abolitionism and Unitarianism were linked together in the public mind. He was a member of Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel.

In 1796, Roscoe gave up legal practice, and toyed with the idea of going to the bar. Between 1793 and 1800, he paid much attention to agriculture, and helped to reclaim Chat Moss, near Eccles, Lancashire. He also succeeded in restoring to good order the affairs of a banking house in which his friend William Clark, then resident in Italy, was a partner. This led to his introduction to the business, which eventually proved disastrous.

Roscoe was elected Member of Parliament for Liverpool in 1806, but the House of Commons was not for him, and at the dissolution in the following year he stood down. During his brief stay however, he was able to cast his vote in favour of the successful abolition of the slave trade.

In the early 1800s, he led a group of Liverpool botanists who created the Liverpool Botanic Garden as a private garden, initially located near Mount Pleasant, which was then on the outskirts of the city. In the 1830s the garden was moved to Wavertree Botanic Gardens; remnants of the collection can still be found in the walled garden at Croxteth Hall.

The commercial troubles of 1816 brought into difficulties the banking house with which he was connected, and forced the sale of his collections of books and pictures. Dr S.H. Spiker, the king of Prussia&#x27;s librarian, visited Roscoe at this difficult time. Roscoe said he still desired to write a biography of Erasmus but lacked both leisure and youth. The project was never carried out. Around this time Roscoe was asked to investigate the claims of the blind girl Margaret M&#x27;Avoy, who was said to be able to read using her fingers, at the request of Sir Joseph Banks. Roscoe concluded that her amazing abilities were due to the fact that she was not blind.

After five years struggling to discharge the liabilities of the bank, the action of some creditors forced the partners into bankruptcy in 1820. For a time Roscoe was in danger of arrest, but ultimately he received an honourable discharge. On the dispersal of his library, the volumes most useful to him were secured by friends and placed in the Liverpool Athenaeum of which he had been a founding member in 1797. The sum of £2,500 was also invested for his benefit.

Roscoe was also closely associated with the formation of the Liverpool Royal Institution in Colquitt Street, first as chairman of the General Committee and subsequently as its first President.

==Retirement==
Having now resigned commercial pursuits entirely, he found a pleasant task in the arrangement of the great library at Holkham Hall, the property of his friend Thomas Coke.
In the 1820s, he started to publish his important work on the reorganisation of the Zingiberales order of flowering plants. This was called &quot;Monandrian Plants of the Order Scitamineae: Chiefly Drawn from Living Specimens in the Botanical Gardens at Liverpool&quot;. It was originally issued in 15 parts and then 150 copies of the complete set were published. The Scitamineaen order (nowadays Zingiberales), almost exclusively tropical in origin, includes the canna lilies, arrowroot, ginger, and turmeric. Roscoe provides 1 or 2 pages of text for each of 112 specimens, giving the plant&#x27;s binomial, a technical description followed by a fuller more general description, and ending with &quot;observations&quot; (notes on where the plant is from, who has described it previously, and often when the drawing of the plant was made) and &quot;references&quot; (brief explanations of the small numbered dissections found on each plate).

==Legacy==
Roscoe showed considerable moral courage as well as devotion to study. He had many friends. Posterity is not likely to endorse the verdict of Horace Walpole, who thought Roscoe the best of our historians, but his books on Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici and Pope Leo X remained important contributions to historical literature.

Many of his collection of paintings, dispersed in auctions during his financial troubles, remained in Liverpool and later reached the Walker Art Gallery, which in 2015 had extra labels marking them out as once part of Roscoe&#x27;s collection. Roscoe was a relatively early collector of the &quot;Italian Primitives&quot;.

He died on 30 June 1831 and was buried in the Unitarian Grave Yard at Mount Pleasant, a memorial plaque indicates the approximate spot of his grave.

==Works==

His poem, &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;, was written when he was sixteen, and together with other verses, now forgotten, won the esteem of critics.

He wrote a long poem published in two parts called &quot;The Wrongs of Africa&quot; (1787–1788), and entered into a controversy with an ex-Roman Catholic priest called Fr Raymond Harris, who tried to justify the slave trade through the Bible (and was generously paid for his efforts by Liverpool businessmen involved with the slave trade). Roscoe also wrote a pamphlet in 1788 entitled &quot;A General View of the African Slave Trade&quot;. Roscoe was also a political pamphleteer, and like many other Liberals of the day hailed the promise of liberty in the French Revolution.

Meanwhile, he had pursued his Italian studies, and had carried out research, which resulted in his &quot;Life of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici&quot;, which appeared in 1796, and gained him a reputation among contemporary historians. It was often reprinted, and translations in French, German and other languages show that its popularity was not confined to Britain. Angelo Fabroni, who had intended to translate his own Latin life of Lorenzo, abandoned the idea and persuaded Gaetano Mecherini to undertake an Italian version of Roscoe&#x27;s work. Roscoe&#x27;s translation of Luigi Tansillo&#x27;s &quot;Nurse&quot; appeared in 1798, and went through several editions. It is dedicated in a sonnet to his wife, who had practised the precepts of the Italian poet.

&quot;The Life and Pontificate of Leo the Tenth&quot; appeared in 1805, and was a natural sequel to his previous work of history. The new work, whilst it maintained its author&#x27;s fame, did not meet with so favourable a reception as the &quot;Life of Lorenzo&quot;. It was frequently reprinted, and the insertion of the Italian translation in the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; did not prevent its circulation even in the Papal States.

He wrote the &quot;Sonnet on Parting with his Books&quot; on the 1816 sale of his library. In 1822 he issued an appendix of illustrations to his Lorenzo and also a &quot;Memoir of Richard Robert Jones of Aberdaron&quot;, a remarkable self-taught linguist. The year 1824 was memorable for the death of his wife and the publication of his edition of the works of Alexander Pope, which involved him in a controversy with William Lisle Bowles. His versatility was shown by the appearance of a folio monograph on the &quot;Monandrian Plants&quot;, which was published in 1828. The last part came out after his recovery from a stroke.

In addition to these, Roscoe wrote tracts on penal jurisprudence and contributed to the Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature and of the Linnean Society. The first collected edition of his &quot;Poetical Works&quot; was published in 1857, and is sadly incomplete, omitting, with other verses known to be from his pen, the &quot;Butterfly&#x27;s Ball&quot;, a fantasy, which has charmed thousands of children since it appeared in 1807. Other verses are in &quot;Poems for Youth, by a Family Circle&quot; (1820).

==Family==
Roscoe and his wife had seven sons and three daughters, including William Stanley Roscoe (1782–1843), a poet, Thomas Roscoe (1791–1871), translator from Italian, and Henry (1800–1836), a legal writer who wrote his father&#x27;s biography. Henry&#x27;s wife, Maria Roscoe, née Fletcher (1798–1885), wrote a biography of Vittoria Colonna, and their son Henry Enfield Roscoe (1833–1915) was a chemist and vice-chancellor of the University of London. Daughter Mary Anne was known as a poet by her married name Mary Anne Jevons, and was the mother of William Stanley Jevons. Roscoe&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Margaret Roscoe was one of the illustrators for his publication &quot;Monandrian Plants of the Order Scitamineae: Chiefly Drawn from Living Specimens in the Botanical Gardens at Liverpool&quot;.

==Artistic recognition==

A bust of Roscoe dated 1816 by John Gibson is held in the Royal Institution in Liverpool.

<text>Fugitive pigments are pigments that lighten, darken, or otherwise change in appearance or physicality over time when exposed to environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, humidity, or pollution. Fugitive pigments are present in types of paint, markers, inks etc., which are used for temporary applications. Fugitive inks which washed away when soaked in water were sometimes used deliberately to prevent postage stamps being removed from envelopes by soaking, and reused (e.g., the Queen Victoria Lilac and Green Issue).

While permanent pigments are usually used for paintings, painters have made work wholly or partially with fugitive pigments for a number of reasons: availability and cost of pigments; being more concerned with the appearance of colors available only with fugitive pigments than with permanence; lack of knowledge regarding the deterioration of pigments; or the desire to have a painting change in appearance over time.
