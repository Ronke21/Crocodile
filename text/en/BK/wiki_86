<text>The Vicksburg campaign was a series of maneuvers and battles in the Western Theater of the American Civil War directed against Vicksburg, Mississippi, a fortress city that dominated the last Confederate-controlled section of the Mississippi River. The Union Army of the Tennessee under Major General Ulysses S. Grant gained control of the river by capturing this stronghold and defeating Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton&#x27;s forces stationed there.

The campaign consisted of many important naval operations, troop maneuvers, failed initiatives, and eleven distinct battles from December 26, 1862, to July 4, 1863. Military historians divide the campaign into two formal phases: operations against Vicksburg (December 1862 – January 1863) and Grant&#x27;s operations against Vicksburg (March – July 1863).

Grant initially planned a two-pronged approach in which half of his army, under Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, would advance to the Yazoo River and attempt to reach Vicksburg from the northeast, while Grant took the remainder of the army down the Mississippi Central Railroad. Both of these initiatives failed. Grant conducted a number of &quot;experiments&quot; or expeditions—Grant&#x27;s bayou operations—that attempted to enable waterborne access to the Mississippi south of Vicksburg&#x27;s artillery batteries. All five of these initiatives failed as well. Finally, Union gunboats and troop transport boats ran the batteries at Vicksburg and met up with Grant&#x27;s men who had marched overland in Louisiana. On April 29 and April 30, 1863, Grant&#x27;s army crossed the Mississippi and landed at Bruinsburg, Mississippi. An elaborate series of demonstrations and diversions fooled the Confederates and the landings occurred without opposition. Over the next 17 days, Grant maneuvered his army inland and won five battles, captured the state capital of Jackson, Mississippi, and assaulted and laid siege to Vicksburg.

After Pemberton&#x27;s army surrendered on July 4 (one day after the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg), and when Port Hudson surrendered to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9, Texas and Arkansas were effectively cut off from the Confederacy, and the Mississippi River was once again open for northern commerce to reach the Gulf of Mexico, and as a supply line for the Union Army. Grant&#x27;s Vicksburg campaign is studied as a masterpiece of military operations and a major turning point of the war.

==Background==

=== Military situation ===
Vicksburg was strategically vital to the Confederates. Jefferson Davis said, &quot;Vicksburg is the nail head that holds the South&#x27;s two halves together.&quot; While in their hands, it blocked Union navigation down the Mississippi; together with control of the mouth of the Red River and of Port Hudson to the south, it allowed communication with the states west of the river, upon which the Confederates depended extensively for horses, cattle and reinforcements. The natural defenses of the city were ideal, earning it the nickname &quot;The Gibraltar of the Confederacy&quot;. It was located on a high bluff overlooking a horseshoe-shaped bend in the river, De Soto Peninsula, making it almost impossible to approach by ship. North and east of Vicksburg was the Mississippi Delta (sometimes known as the Yazoo Delta), an area 200 miles (320 km) north to south and up to 50 miles (80 km) across, which has been described by geographer Warren E. Grabau as an &quot;astonishingly complex network of intersecting waterways&quot;, some of which were navigable by small steamboats. The regions between modern rivers and bayous formed closed basins called backswamps, of which Grabau judged, &quot;Whether permanently flooded or not, the backswamps were, for all practical purposes, untamed wildernesses, utterly impassable by a man on horseback or by any form of wheeled vehicle, and very difficult even for a man on foot.&quot; About twelve miles (19 km) up the Yazoo River were Confederate batteries and entrenchments at Haynes Bluff. The Louisiana land west of Vicksburg was also difficult, with many streams and poor country roads, widespread winter flooding, and it was on the opposite side of the river from the fortress.

The city had been under Union naval attack before. Admiral David Farragut moved up the river after his capture of New Orleans and on May 18, 1862, demanded the surrender of Vicksburg. Farragut had insufficient troops to force the issue, and he moved back to New Orleans. He returned with a flotilla in June 1862, but their attempts (June 26–28) to bombard the fortress into surrender failed. They shelled Vicksburg throughout July and fought some minor battles with a few Confederate vessels in the area, but their forces were insufficient to attempt a landing, and they abandoned attempts to force the surrender of the city. Farragut investigated the possibility of bypassing the fortified cliffs by digging a canal across the neck of the river&#x27;s bend, the De Soto Peninsula. On June 28, Brig. Gen. Thomas Williams, attached to Farragut&#x27;s command, began digging work on the canal by employing local laborers and some soldiers. Many of the men fell victim to tropical diseases and heat exhaustion, and the work was abandoned by July 24. (Williams was killed two weeks later in the Battle of Baton Rouge).

In the fall of 1862, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck was promoted from command of the Western Theater to General-in-Chief of all Union armies. On November 23, he indicated to Grant his preference for a major move down the Mississippi to Vicksburg; in Halleck&#x27;s style, he left considerable initiative to design a campaign, an opportunity that the pugnacious Grant seized. Halleck has received criticism for not moving promptly overland from Memphis, Tennessee, to seize Vicksburg during the summer when he was in command on the scene. He believed that the Navy could capture the fortress on its own, not knowing that the naval force was insufficiently manned with ground troops to finish the job. What might have achieved success in the summer of 1862 was no longer possible by November because the Confederates had amply reinforced the garrison by that time. Also, reliable navigation on the river was seasonal, and the natural fall in the level of the river during the fall and winter months limited the utility of shipping, the usable draft of riverboats, and the quantity of men, supplies, and equipment, they could transport.

Grant&#x27;s army marched south down the Mississippi Central Railroad, making a forward base at Holly Springs. He planned a two-pronged assault in the direction of Vicksburg. His principal subordinate, Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, was to advance down the river with four divisions (about 32,000 men) and Grant would continue with the remaining forces (about 40,000) down the railroad line to Oxford, where he would wait for developments, hoping to lure the Confederate army out of the city to attack him in the vicinity of Grenada, Mississippi.

On the Confederate side, forces in Mississippi were under the command of Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton, an officer from Pennsylvania who chose to fight for the South. Pemberton had approximately 12,000 men in Vicksburg and Jackson, Mississippi, and Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn had approximately 24,000 at Grenada.

Meanwhile, political forces were at work. President Abraham Lincoln had long recognized the importance of Vicksburg; he wrote &quot;Vicksburg is the key. ...The war can never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket.&quot; Lincoln also envisioned a two-pronged offensive, but one up and down the river. Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand, a War Democrat politician, had convinced Lincoln that he could lead an army down the river and take Vicksburg. Lincoln approved his proposal and wanted Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks to advance up river from New Orleans at the same time. McClernand began organizing regiments, sending them to Memphis. Back in Washington, D.C., Halleck was nervous about McClernand and gave Grant control of all troops in his own department. McClernand&#x27;s troops were split into two corps, one under McClernand, the other under Sherman. McClernand complained but to no avail. Grant appropriated his troops, one of several maneuvers in a private dispute within the Union Army between Grant and McClernand that continued throughout the campaign.

==Battles in the operations against Vicksburg, December 1862 – January 1863==

The &quot;operations against Vicksburg&quot; phase of the Vicksburg campaign comprises the following battles:

===Chickasaw Bayou (December 26–29, 1862)===

Sherman disembarked with three divisions at Johnson&#x27;s Plantation on the Yazoo River to approach the Vicksburg defenses from the northeast. On December 27, the Federals pushed their lines forward through the swamps toward the Walnut Hills, which were strongly defended. On December 28, several futile attempts were made to get around these defenses. On December 29, Sherman ordered a frontal assault, which was repulsed with heavy casualties, and then withdrew.

During this period, the overland half of Grant&#x27;s offensive was failing. His lines of communication were disrupted by raids by Van Dorn, who destroyed his large supply depot at Holly Springs, and by Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest. Unable to subsist his army without these supplies, Grant abandoned his overland advance.

In early January, McClernand arrived at Memphis with the corps he had recruited (the XIII Corps under Brig. Gen. George W. Morgan) and commenced his operation down the Mississippi. On January 4, he ordered Sherman to attach his XV Corps to the expedition, calling his combined 32,000-man force the Army of the Mississippi. This was a direct provocation against Grant, but Sherman acceded to the senior officer. Sherman suggested beginning with a combined land and naval movement against Fort Hindman, on the Arkansas River at Arkansas Post, 50 miles up the Arkansas from its confluence with the Mississippi, a base from which Confederate gunboats were attacking Union shipping on the river. The expedition started without notifying Grant.

===Arkansas Post (January 9–11, 1863)===

Union boats under Rear Adm. David Dixon Porter began landing troops near Arkansas Post in the evening of January 9. The troops started up river towards Fort Hindman. Sherman&#x27;s corps overran Confederate trenches, and the defenders retreated to the protection of the fort and adjacent rifle-pits. Porter, on January 10, moved his fleet towards Fort Hindman and bombarded it, withdrawing at dusk. Union artillery fired on the fort from positions across the river on January 11, and the infantry moved into position for an attack. Union ironclads commenced shelling the fort and Porter&#x27;s fleet passed it to cut off any retreat. As a result of this envelopment, and the attack by Morgan&#x27;s troops, the Confederate command surrendered in the afternoon. Although Union losses were high and the victory did not contribute to the capture of Vicksburg, it did eliminate one more impediment to Union shipping on the Mississippi.

Grant was not happy to learn that McClernand had conducted the operation without his approval, considering it a distraction from his main objective of Vicksburg, but since it had been successful and his ally Sherman had suggested it, he took no punitive action. However, he ordered McClernand back to the Mississippi and assumed personal command of the campaign on January 13 at Milliken&#x27;s Bend, 15 miles northwest of Vicksburg.

==Grant&#x27;s bayou operations, January–March 1863==
That winter, Grant conducted a series of initiatives to approach and capture Vicksburg, termed &quot;Grant&#x27;s bayou operations&quot;. Their general theme was to use or construct alternative waterways so that troops could be positioned within striking distance of Vicksburg, without requiring a direct approach on the Mississippi under the Confederate guns.

===Grant&#x27;s Canal===

The Williams Canal across De Soto Peninsula had been abandoned by Adm. Farragut and Brig. Gen. Williams in July 1862, but it had the potential to offer a route downriver that bypassed Vicksburg&#x27;s guns. In late January 1863, Sherman&#x27;s men, at the urging of Grant—who was advised by the navy that President Lincoln liked the idea—resumed digging. Sherman derisively called the work &quot;Butler&#x27;s Ditch&quot; (since it was Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler who had sent Williams upriver to do the work), which was barely 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep. Grant, undoubtedly influenced by Lincoln&#x27;s continual inquiries as to the status of the canal, ordered Sherman to expand the canal to 60 feet wide and 7 feet deep and the effort became known as Grant&#x27;s Canal. It was not properly engineered based upon the hydrology of the Mississippi River, however, and a sudden rise in the river broke through the dam at the head of the canal and flooded the area. The canal began to fill up with back water and sediment. In a desperate effort to rescue the project, two huge steam-driven dipper dredges, &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Sampson&quot;, attempted to clear the channel, but the dredges were exposed to Confederate artillery fire from the bluffs at Vicksburg and driven away. By late March, work on the canal was abandoned. (Remnants of about 200 yards of Grant&#x27;s Canal are maintained by the Vicksburg National Military Park in Louisiana).

===Lake Providence expedition===
Grant ordered Brig. Gen. James B. McPherson to construct a canal of several hundred yards from the Mississippi to Lake Providence, northwest of the city. This would allow passage to the Red River, through Bayous Baxter and Macon, and the Tensas and Black Rivers. Reaching the Red River, Grant&#x27;s force could join with Banks at Port Hudson. McPherson reported that the connection was navigable on March 18, but the few &quot;ordinary Ohio River boats&quot; that had been sent to Grant for navigation of the bayous could only transport 8,500 men. The boats through Lake Providence increased the Union soldiers to a force of 30,000 and provided the field commander the flexibility of a 4:1 advantage, potentially more than enough to ensure a successful siege of Port Hudson. Although this was the only one of the bayou expeditions to successfully bypass the Vicksburg defenses, historian Ed Bearss diminishes this exploit as the &quot;Lake Providence Boondoggle&quot;.

===Yazoo Pass expedition===

The next attempt was to get to the high ground of the loess bluffs above Hayne&#x27;s Bluff and below Yazoo City by blowing up the Mississippi River levee near Moon Lake, some 150 miles (240 km) above Vicksburg, near Helena, Arkansas, and following the Yazoo Pass (an old route from Yazoo City to Memphis, which was curtailed by the 1856 levee construction that sealed off the Pass from the Mississippi River to Moon Lake) into the Coldwater River, then to the Tallahatchie River, and finally into the Yazoo River at Greenwood, Mississippi. The dikes were blown up on February 3, beginning what was called the Yazoo Pass Expedition. Ten Union boats, under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Watson Smith, with army troops under the command of Brig. Gen. Benjamin Prentiss, began moving through the pass on February 7. But low-hanging trees destroyed anything on the gunboats above deck and Confederates felled more trees to block the way. These delays allowed the Confederates time to quickly construct Fort Pemberton near the confluence of the Tallahatchie and Yalobusha Rivers near Greenwood, Mississippi, which repulsed the naval force on March 11, March 14, and March 16. The Union effort collapsed in early April.

===Steele&#x27;s Bayou expedition===

Admiral Porter started an effort on March 14 to go up the Yazoo Delta via Steele&#x27;s Bayou, just north of Vicksburg, to Deer Creek. This would outflank Fort Pemberton and allow landing troops between Vicksburg and Yazoo City. Confederates once again felled trees in their path, and willow reeds fouled the boats&#x27; paddlewheels. This time the Union boats became immobilized, and Confederate cavalry and infantry threatened to capture them. Sherman sent infantry assistance to repel the Confederates bedeviling Porter, but Porter&#x27;s approach was abandoned as too difficult.

===Duckport Canal===

Grant&#x27;s final attempt was to dig another canal from Duckport Landing to Walnut Bayou, aimed at getting lighter boats past Vicksburg. By the time the canal was almost finished, on April 6, water levels were declining, and none but the lightest of flatboats could get through. Grant abandoned this canal and started planning anew.

From December through March, including Chickasaw Bayou and the Mississippi Central advance, seven initiatives, or &quot;experiments&quot;, by Grant had failed. Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had undertaken these experiments primarily to keep his troops busy during the flooded and disease-laden winter months and that he had had no expectation of success. This claim is contradicted by correspondence from Grant at the time.

==Plan for the 1863 campaign and initial movements==

All of the bayou operations were failures, but Grant was well known for his stubborn determination and would not quit. His final option was bold but risky: Grant would march the Union army down the west side of the Mississippi, cross the river south of Vicksburg, and either attack Vicksburg from the south and the east or join forces with Banks, capture Port Hudson, and then together reduce Vicksburg. Porter would have to sneak past the guns to get sufficient gunboats and transport ships south of the city. Once they had completed the downstream passage, they would not be able to return past Vicksburg&#x27;s guns because the river current would slow them too much.

On March 29, McClernand set his troops to work building bridges and corduroy roads. They filled in the swamps in their way as well, and by April 17 they had a rough, tortuous 70-mile (110 km) road from Milliken&#x27;s Bend to the proposed river crossing at Hard Times, Louisiana, below Vicksburg.
On April 16, a clear night with no moon, Porter sent seven gunboats and three empty troop transports loaded with stores to run the bluff, taking care to minimize noise and lights. But the preparations were ineffective. Confederate sentries sighted the boats, and the bluff exploded with massive artillery fire. Fires were set along the banks to improve visibility. The Union gunboats answered back. Porter observed that the Confederates mainly hit the high parts of his boats, reasoned that they could not depress their guns, and had them hug the east shore, right under Confederate cannon, so close he could hear their commanders giving orders, shells flying overhead. The fleet survived with little damage; thirteen men were wounded and none killed. The &quot;Henry Clay&quot; was disabled and burned at the water&#x27;s edge. On April 22, six more boats loaded with supplies made the run; one boat did not make it, though no one was killed. The crew floated downstream on the boat&#x27;s remnants.

The final piece of Grant&#x27;s strategy was to divert Pemberton&#x27;s attention from the river crossing site that the Union troops would use. Grant chose two operations: a feint by Sherman against Snyder&#x27;s Bluff, Mississippi, north of Vicksburg (see the Battle of Snyder&#x27;s Bluff below), and a daring cavalry raid through central Mississippi by Col. Benjamin Grierson, known as Grierson&#x27;s Raid. Both were eminently successful. Of Sherman&#x27;s feint, Grant writes:My object was to compel Pemberton to keep as much force about Vicksburg as I could, until I could secure a good footing on high land east of the river. The move was eminently successful and, as we afterwards learned, created great confusion about Vicksburg and doubts about our real design.Grierson was able to draw out significant Confederate forces to chase him, and Pemberton&#x27;s defenses were dispersed too far around the state. (Pemberton was also wary of Nathaniel Banks&#x27;s impending advance up the river from Baton Rouge to threaten Port Hudson.). Of Grierson&#x27;s raid, Grant writes:It was at Port Gibson I first heard through a Southern paper of the complete success of Colonel Grierson, who was making a raid through central Mississippi...This raid was of great importance, for Grierson had attracted the attention of the enemy from the main movement against Vicksburg.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===
Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Union Army of the Tennessee started the campaign with about 44,500 men, which grew by July to 75,000. The army was composed of five corps: the XIII Corps, under Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand; the XV Corps, under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman; the XVII Corps, under Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson; a three-division detachment of the XVI Corps, under Maj. Gen. Cadwallader C. Washburn; and a detachment from the District of Northeast Louisiana, under Brig. Gen. Elias S. Dennis. The IX Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, joined the army in mid-June.

===Confederate===
Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton&#x27;s Confederate Army of Mississippi, approximately 30,000 men, consisted of five divisions, under Maj. Gens. William W. Loring, Carter L. Stevenson, John H. Forney, Martin L. Smith, and John S. Bowen.

General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s forces in Raymond and Jackson, Mississippi, about 6,000 men, were elements of his Department of the West, including the brigades of Brig. Gen. John Gregg, and Col. Peyton H. Colquitt. Loring&#x27;s division had joined Johnston on May 17 after the retreat from Champion Hill and Johnston was further reinforced by Brig. Gen. William H.T. Walker&#x27;s division, and the cavalry division of Brig. Gen. William Hicks Jackson in late May, followed by the divisions of Maj. Gens. John C. Breckinridge and Samuel G. French in June, bringing his total strength to about 36,000 when Vicksburg surrendered.

==Battles in Grant&#x27;s operations against Vicksburg, April – July 1863==

The &quot;Grant&#x27;s operations against Vicksburg&quot; phase of the Vicksburg campaign comprises the following battles:

===Grand Gulf (April 29, 1863)===

Admiral Porter led seven ironclads in an attack on the fortifications and batteries at Grand Gulf, Mississippi, with the intention of silencing the Confederate guns and then securing the area with troops of McClernand&#x27;s XIII Corps who were on the accompanying transports and barges. The attack by the seven ironclads began at 8 a.m. and continued until about 1:30 p.m. During the fight, the ironclads moved within 100 yards of the Confederate guns and silenced the lower batteries of Fort Wade. The Confederate upper batteries at Fort Cobun remained out of reach and continued to fire. Due to the strong Confederate resistance, Grant and Porter decided it was not feasible to make an amphibious landing at Grand Gulf, but later landed at Bruinsburg, Mississippi, instead. The Union ironclads (one of which, the &quot;Tuscumbia&quot;, had been put out of action) and the transports temporarily drew off, but later that afternoon, while the angle of the sun interfered with Confederate aiming, Porter again sent his ships to Grand Gulf. While the ironclads screened them, the steamboats and barges ran the gauntlet. Meanwhile, Grant marched his men overland across Coffee Point to below the Gulf. After the transports had passed Grand Gulf, they embarked the troops at Disharoon&#x27;s plantation and disembarked them on the Mississippi shore at Bruinsburg, below Grand Gulf. Grant landed 17,000 soldiers there, the largest amphibious operation in American military history until the Invasion of Normandy. The men immediately began marching overland towards Port Gibson, Mississippi, where, on May 1, they fought the Battle of Port Gibson with Bowen&#x27;s Confederates. Bowen&#x27;s right flank was driven in, and Bowen&#x27;s men conducted a fighting withdrawal from the field. On May 3, the Confederates abandoned the fortifications at Grand Gulf. The Confederates had won a hollow victory, since the loss at Grand Gulf caused just a slight change in Grant&#x27;s offensive.

===Snyder&#x27;s Bluff (April 29 – May 1)===

To ensure that troops would not be withdrawn to Grand Gulf to assist Confederates there, a combined Union army-navy force feigned an attack on Snyder&#x27;s Bluff. After noon on April 29, Lt. Cdr. K. Randolph Breese, with his eight gunboats and ten transports carrying Maj. Gen. Francis P. Blair&#x27;s division, inched up the Yazoo River to the mouth of Chickasaw Bayou where they spent the night. At 9 a.m., the next morning, the force, minus one gunboat, continued upriver to Drumgould&#x27;s Bluff and engaged the enemy batteries. During the fighting, &quot;Choctaw&quot; suffered more than fifty hits, but no casualties occurred. Around 6 p.m., the troops disembarked and marched along Blake&#x27;s Levee toward the guns. As they neared Drumgould&#x27;s Bluff, a battery opened on them, creating havoc and casualties. The Union advance halted and, after dark, the men reembarked on the transports. The next morning, transports disembarked other troops. The swampy terrain and enemy heavy artillery fire forced them to retire. The gunboats opened fire again, about 3 p.m. on May 1, causing some damage. Later, the boats&#x27; fire slackened and stopped altogether after dark. Sherman had received orders to land his troops at Milliken&#x27;s Bend, so the gunboats returned to their anchorages at the mouth of the Yazoo.

===Port Gibson (May 1)===

Grant&#x27;s army began marching inland from Bruinsburg. Advancing on the Rodney Road towards Port Gibson, they ran into Confederate outposts after midnight and skirmished with them for around three hours. After 3 a.m., the fighting stopped. Union forces advanced on the Rodney Road and a plantation road at dawn. At 5:30 a.m., the Confederates engaged the Union advance and the battle ensued. Federals forced the Confederates to fall back. The Confederates established new defensive positions at different times during the day, but they could not stop the Union onslaught and left the field in the early evening. This defeat demonstrated that the Confederates were unable to defend the Mississippi River line, and the Federals had secured their beachhead.

At this point, Grant faced a decision. His original orders were to capture Grand Gulf and then proceed south to link up with Banks and reduce Port Hudson, after which their combined armies would return and capture Vicksburg. Unfortunately for Grant, such a course would put him under the command of the more senior major general and the credit for any success in the theater would go to Banks. Since Banks was occupied with operations on the Red River and had informed Grant that he was not ready to begin operations against Port Hudson within the next few days, Grant decided to move on his own against Vicksburg. He sent a message to Halleck about his intentions, knowing that it would take as many as eight days for Washington to receive the message and respond.

After the Union army seized the crossing at Grindstone Ford, any Confederate forces between the Big Bayou Pierre and the Big Black River were compromised. Realizing this, Bowen evacuated Grand Gulf and proceeded with all speed to Hankinson&#x27;s Ford across the Big Black, barely escaping the Union trap. Grant&#x27;s intention at this time was to move north over this same route and advance directly on Vicksburg. However, scouting parties that he sent out found that Pemberton had good defensive positions to the south of the city. Instead, he decided to break the city&#x27;s supply line by seizing the railroad from Jackson to Vicksburg. He gave orders for his three corps (Sherman having arrived across the river) to advance over three separate routes to attack the railroad at Edwards Station (the westernmost objective, with McClernand&#x27;s corps), Clinton (easternmost, with McPherson&#x27;s) and Midway Station (center, with Sherman&#x27;s).

===Raymond (May 12)===

On May 10, Pemberton ordered all reinforcements arriving at Jackson to march to Raymond, 20 miles (32 km) to the southwest. Brig. Gen. John Gregg&#x27;s overstrength brigade, having endured a grueling march from Port Hudson, Louisiana, began marching to Raymond the next morning, arriving late in the afternoon of May 11. On May 12, Gregg&#x27;s brigade moved to ambush a Union raiding party at Fourteen Mile Creek. The raiding party turned out to be Maj. Gen. John A. Logan&#x27;s Division of the XVII Corps. Gregg decided to dispute the crossing of Fourteen Mile Creek and arrayed his men and artillery accordingly. As Logan&#x27;s men approached, the Confederates opened fire, initially causing heavy casualties. Some Union troops broke, but Logan rallied a force to hold the line. Confederate troops attacked the line but were forced to retire. Additional Union troops arrived and counterattacked. Heavy fighting ensued that continued for six hours, but the overwhelming Union force prevailed. Gregg&#x27;s men left the field. Although they lost the battle, they had held up a much superior Union force for a day. General Gregg, under orders to withdraw to Jackson in the face of a superior force, withdrew five miles (8 km) in the direction of Jackson to Mississippi Springs, Mississippi. This retrograde movement exposed the Southern Railroad of Mississippi to Union forces, thus severing the lifeline of Vicksburg.

Despite McPherson&#x27;s victory, the presence of Confederate forces attacking Grant&#x27;s right flank caused him to reconsider his plan. He learned that Gen. Joseph E. Johnston was due in Jackson with reinforcements within the next couple of days, and there was a rumor that Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard would also arrive on the scene. In this situation, the Union army would be between enemy forces on each flank. Therefore, he chose to deal with the threat from the east first and ordered Sherman and McPherson to seize Jackson.

===Jackson (May 14)===

On May 9, Gen. Johnston received a dispatch from the Confederate Secretary of War directing him to &quot;proceed at once to Mississippi and take chief command of the forces in the field&quot;. When he arrived in Jackson on May 13 from Middle Tennessee, he learned that two army corps—Sherman&#x27;s and McPherson&#x27;s—were advancing on Jackson and that Gregg had only about 6,000 troops available to defend the city. Johnston ordered the evacuation of Jackson, but Gregg was to defend Jackson until the evacuation was completed. By 10 a.m., both Union army corps were near Jackson and had engaged the enemy. Rain, Confederate resistance, and poor defenses prevented heavy fighting until around 11 a.m., when Union forces attacked in numbers and slowly but surely pushed the enemy back. In mid-afternoon, Johnston informed Gregg that the evacuation was complete and that he should disengage and follow. Soon after, the Union troops entered Jackson and had a celebration hosted by Grant, who had been traveling with Sherman&#x27;s corps, in the Bowman House. They then burned part of the town, destroyed numerous factories, and cut the railroad connections with Vicksburg. Johnston&#x27;s evacuation is seen as a mistake because he could, by late on May 14, have had 11,000 troops at his disposal and by the morning of May 15, another 4,000. The fall of the Mississippi state capital was a blow to Confederate morale. Having broken the rail links, Grant temporarily abandoned the city to allow his troops to concentrate on Vicksburg.

Johnston retreated with most of his army up the Canton Road, but he ordered Pemberton to leave Edwards Station and attack the Federals at Clinton. Pemberton and his generals felt that Johnston&#x27;s plan was dangerous and decided instead to attack the Union supply trains moving from Grand Gulf to Raymond. On May 16, however, Pemberton received another order from Johnston repeating his former directions. Pemberton had already started after the supply trains and was on the Raymond-Edwards Road with his rear at the crossroads one-third mile south of the crest of Champion Hill. Thus, when he ordered a countermarch, his rear, including his many supply wagons, became the vanguard of his force.

===Champion Hill (May 16)===

On May 16, about 7 a.m., the Union forces engaged the Confederates and the Battle of Champion Hill began. Pemberton&#x27;s force drew up into a defensive line along a crest of a ridge overlooking Jackson Creek. Pemberton was unaware that one Union column was moving along the Jackson Road against his unprotected left flank. For protection, Pemberton posted Brig. Gen. Stephen D. Lee&#x27;s men atop Champion Hill where they could watch for the reported Union column moving to the crossroads. Lee spotted the Union troops and they soon saw him. If this force was not stopped, it would cut the Confederates off from their Vicksburg base. Pemberton received warning of the Union movement and sent troops to his left flank. Union forces at the Champion House moved into action and emplaced artillery to begin firing. When Grant arrived at Champion Hill, around 10 a.m., he ordered the attack to begin. By 11:30 a.m., Union forces had reached the Confederate main line and at about 1 p.m., they took the crest while the Confederates retreated in disorder. The Federals swept forward, capturing the crossroads and closing the Jackson Road escape route. One of Pemberton&#x27;s divisions (Bowen&#x27;s) then counterattacked, pushing the Federals back beyond the Champion Hill crest before their surge came to a halt. Grant then counterattacked, committing forces that had just arrived from Clinton by way of Bolton. Pemberton&#x27;s men could not stand up to this assault, so he ordered his men from the field to the one escape route still open: the Raymond Road crossing of Bakers Creek. Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman&#x27;s brigade formed the rearguard, and they held at all costs, including the loss of Tilghman. In the late afternoon, Union troops seized the Bakers Creek Bridge, and by midnight, they occupied Edwards. The Confederates were in full retreat towards Vicksburg.

===Big Black River Bridge (May 17)===

The Confederate retreat reached Big Black River Bridge the night of May 16–17. Pemberton ordered Brig. Gen. Bowen, with three brigades, to man the fortifications on the east bank of the river and impede any Union pursuit. Three divisions of McClernand&#x27;s corps moved out from Edwards Station on the morning of May 17. The corps encountered the Confederates behind breastworks and took cover as enemy artillery began firing. Union Brig. Gen. Michael K. Lawler formed his 2nd Brigade, Brig. Gen. Eugene A. Carr&#x27;s Division, which surged out of a river meander scar, across the front of the Confederate forces, and into the enemy&#x27;s breastworks, held by Brig. Gen. John C. Vaughn&#x27;s inexperienced East Tennessee Brigade. Confused and panicked, the Confederates began to withdraw across the Big Black on two bridges: the railroad bridge and the steamboat dock moored athwart the river. As soon as they had crossed, the Confederates set fire to the bridges, preventing close Union pursuit. The fleeing Confederates who arrived in Vicksburg later that day were disorganized. The Union forces captured approximately 1,800 troops at Big Black, a loss that the Confederates could ill afford.

===Siege of Vicksburg (May 18 – July 4)===
The Union army converged on Vicksburg, trapping Pemberton&#x27;s force. Grant attempted two assaults to break through the strong Confederate fieldworks: May 19 and May 22. The latter assault initially achieved some success in McClernand&#x27;s sector, but it was repulsed with 3,200 casualties. Johnston ordered Pemberton to evacuate the city and save his army, but Pemberton thought it impossible to withdraw safely. Johnston planned to attack Grant and relieve Pemberton but was unable to arrange it in time. Grant besieged the Confederate army. On July 4, after six weeks in which the soldiers and civilians of Vicksburg had no food supplies and were bombarded constantly, Pemberton surrendered the city and his army.

In addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant had to be concerned with Confederate forces in his rear. He stationed one division in the vicinity of the Big Black River bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as Mechanicsburg, both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, was transferred to Grant&#x27;s command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at Canton, from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele replaced him at the XV Corps on June 22. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson.

==Louisiana operations==
During the siege of Vicksburg, three other battles took place in the vicinity:

===Milliken&#x27;s Bend (June 7)===

In an effort to cut Grant&#x27;s supply line during the siege, the Confederates attacked the Milliken&#x27;s Bend supply area up the Mississippi. This was mainly defended by untrained black troops, who fought with inferior weaponry and finally repelled the Confederates with help from gunboats, although at significant cost; the defenders lost 652 killed and wounded to the Confederate 185.

===Goodrich&#x27;s Landing (June 29–30)===

After Union forces began occupying the Louisiana river parishes, thousands of escaped slaves flocked to them. The Federals, therefore, leased some plantations and put the freedmen to work growing cotton or other crops; the proceeds from the sale of the crops helped defray expenses for food, clothing, etc. African American troops were assigned to protect these plantations, releasing other troops to fight. Confederates, determined to recapture some of these freedmen and destroy the crops, undertook an expedition from Gaines&#x27;s Landing, Arkansas, to Lake Providence. Although the Confederates disrupted these operations, destroyed much property, and captured many supplies and weapons, the raid was only a minor setback for the Union. The Confederates could cause momentary disturbances, but they were unable to effect any lasting changes.

===Helena (July 4)===

Confederate Lt. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes&#x27;s troops attacked Helena, Arkansas, in an attempt to relieve pressure on Vicksburg. Although the Confederates had more troops and did initially capture some of the fortifications, the Union forces repelled them.

==Aftermath==
Although the Confederate killed and wounded in the battle and siege of Vicksburg were a relatively small 2,872, and Union 4,910, Grant captured his second Confederate army in its entirety (the first being at Fort Donelson): 29,495 surrendered. Most of the Confederates were paroled. The Union also captured significant quantities of artillery, small arms, and ammunition. The full campaign, since March 29, claimed 10,142 Union and 9,091 Confederate killed and wounded.

This was the second major blow to the Confederacy in the summer of 1863. On July 3, Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s invasion of the North collapsed at Gettysburg. On July 4, the Stars and Stripes rose over Vicksburg. To the Confederates, surrendering on Independence Day was a bitter defeat. Union troops behaved well, mixing with Confederates and giving rations to starving soldiers. Speculators who had been hoarding food for higher prices saw their stores broken open and the contents thrown on the streets for the starving rebels. In his &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot;, Grant observed, &quot;The men of the two armies fraternized as if they had been fighting for the same cause.&quot; But resentments lingered: allegedly tradition holds that the Fourth of July holiday was not celebrated by Vicksburg until World War II. This claim has been challenged because large Fourth of July celebrations were being held by 1907.
The most significant result of the campaign was control of the Mississippi River, which the Union obtained completely after Port Hudson, which had been besieged by Banks since May 27, heard news of Vicksburg&#x27;s fall and surrendered on July 9. The Confederacy was now cut in two; one week later, an unarmed ship arrived in Union-held New Orleans from St. Louis after an uneventful trip down the river. President Lincoln announced, &quot;The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.&quot;

Grant deployed Sherman and 50,000 troops against Johnston&#x27;s 31,000 in Jackson. Johnston tried to lure Sherman into a frontal assault, but Sherman had seen the results of such at Vicksburg. He demurred and began surrounding the city. Johnston escaped with his army, which was more than Pemberton had achieved, but all of central Mississippi was now under Sherman&#x27;s control. He used a subsequent operation against Meridian, Mississippi, as a harbinger of the scorched earth tactics he later employed in his March to the Sea through Georgia, and then South Carolina.

One of Grant&#x27;s actions during the siege was to settle a lingering rivalry. On May 30, General McClernand wrote a self-adulatory note to his troops, claiming much of the credit for the soon-to-be victory. Grant had been waiting six months for him to slip, ever since they clashed early in the campaign, around the Battle of Arkansas Post. Grant finally relieved McClernand on June 18. McClernand&#x27;s XIII Corps was turned over to Maj. Gen. Edward Ord. In May 1864, McClernand was restored to a command in remote Texas.

Grant was the undisputed victor of the Vicksburg campaign. He was rewarded for his victory with a promotion to major general in the regular army, effective on July 4, 1863. He also received an unusual letter:

Grant went on to rescue Union forces besieged at Chattanooga and then replaced Halleck as general in chief of all Union armies, with the recently re-activated rank of lieutenant general. Despite his ultimate success in winning the war, historians have often considered Vicksburg his finest campaign—imaginative, audacious, relentless, and a masterpiece of maneuver warfare. James M. McPherson called Vicksburg &quot;the most brilliant and innovative campaign of the Civil War&quot;; T. Harry Williams described it as &quot;one of the classic campaigns of the Civil War and, indeed, of military history&quot;; and the U.S. Army &quot;Field Manual 100–5&quot; (May 1986) called it &quot;the most brilliant campaign ever fought on American soil&quot;.

Historian Steven E. Woodworth wrote that Pemberton &quot;had a strong claim to the title of the most hated man in the South, certainly the most hated to wear a Confederate uniform&quot;. There were accusations that adequate supplies had been on hand and that it was only his treachery that caused the surrender. Even his friend, Confederate general Richard Taylor, wrote after the war that a large part of the population believed &quot;He had joined the South for the express purpose of betraying it, and this was clearly proven by the fact that he surrendered on the 4th of July, a day sacred to the Yankees.&quot; Davis maintained full confidence in Pemberton, pointing out that he would have been severely criticized and denounced if he had not attempted to defend Vicksburg, but had wound up with the same result by trying to do so. Still, Pemberton&#x27;s unpopularity made it impossible for Davis to assign him another command after he returned to the Confederate army once he was exchanged. Eventually he resigned his rank of Lt. General to receive a commission as lieutenant colonel in command of the artillery defenses of Richmond.

The blame for losing Vicksburg fell not only on John Pemberton, but on the overcautious Joseph E. Johnston. Jefferson Davis said of the defeat, &quot;Yes, from a want of provisions inside and a General outside who wouldn&#x27;t fight.&quot;

<text>Ailesbury Road (&quot;Bóthar Aylesbury&quot; in Irish), is a tree-lined avenue in the affluent Dublin 4 area in Dublin, Ireland. It links Sydney Parade Station on Sydney Parade Avenue and the Church of the Sacred Heart at Anglesea Road, Donnybrook. Historically, many embassies and diplomatic residences have been located on the road, including the striking residence of the French Ambassador, the embassy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the Japanese embassy (before it relocated to the nearby Merrion Centre).

From Ailesbury Road, Shrewsbury Road forms a link to Merrion Road, though Ailesbury Road also meets Merrion Road near its eastern end. Other neighbouring street names include Ailesbury Drive, Ailesbury Park, Ailesbury Gardens and Ailesbury Grove.

Reflecting the high property price tags in the area, Ailesbury Road is the second-most expensive property on the Irish Monopoly board, being one of the two &quot;purple&quot; property squares.

==History==
===Danish massacre===
In 1879, the discovery of the remains of 600 people was made at a mound on Ailesbury Road which is believed to date back to a bloody massacre by the Danes in the 9th to 10th century. The bodies were removed and buried in the nearby Donnybrook Cemetery.

===Development===
Ailesbury Road was planned in the middle of the 19th century as a residential road in southeast Dublin, within the Pembroke Township. It was named for George Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury, who had married Mary Herbert, a daughter of the Earl of Pembroke. When first built, Ailesbury Road was then the longest straight road in Dublin.

The original design set for houses to be built on this road is evident in numbers 1 through 51 on the eastern end of the road. These are built of red brick and granite, with a uniform flight of granite steps leading to the hall door, and iron railings bordering the front garden. Numbers 1 through 27 inclusive were built by Alderman Meade, whose designs here and elsewhere in Dublin are characterised by circular granite pillars at the entrance gate. His own residence, which he also designed, is now St Michael&#x27;s School at the Merrion end of the road.

===Number 53===

The former French embassy and ambassadorial residence at number 53 is one of the most exclusive addresses on the road. Formerly known as Mytilene, No. 53 differs from the &quot;standard&quot; building forms of numbers 1 through 51. It is much larger, detached and standing in a wooded garden, and has twin gates flanked by square granite pillars, with a granite balustrade and wide steps leading to a pillared front entrance. This house is constructed of white bricks with inset designs of black bricks and an ornamental rosette frieze, also made of bricks in the same porcelain finish.

The house was purchased by the French Government in the 1930s and became the residence of the first Minister for France to Ireland, Monsieur Alphand. This remained so until 2008 when the French Government decided to sell off the house with a price tag of €60 million making it the most expensive house ever to be put up for sale in Ireland, just after a house on Shrewsbury (just off Ailesbury Road) that sold in 2005 for €58 million. The transaction did not take place though and the house remains the Residence of the French ambassador to Ireland. It has seen the passing of many French Presidents, from General de Gaulle in 1969 to President François Mitterrand in 1988, President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008 and President François Hollande in 2016.

==Amenities==
St Michael&#x27;s College, a voluntary secondary school for boys with an associated primary school co-located, is situated on the road.

<doc id="390646" wikidata="Q1392130" url="?curid=390646" title="Flag (linear algebra)">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, a flag is an increasing sequence of subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot;. Here &quot;increasing&quot; means each is a proper subspace of the next (see filtration):
:formula_1

The term &quot;flag&quot; is motivated by a particular example resembling a flag: the zero point, a line, and a plane correspond to a nail, a staff, and a sheet of fabric.

If we write that dim&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; then we have
:formula_2
where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of &quot;V&quot; (assumed to be finite). Hence, we must have &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;. A flag is called a complete flag if &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;i&quot; for all &quot;i&quot;, otherwise it is called a partial flag.

A partial flag can be obtained from a complete flag by deleting some of the subspaces. Conversely, any partial flag can be completed (in many different ways) by inserting suitable subspaces.

The signature of the flag is the sequence (&quot;d&quot;1, ..., &quot;d&quot;&quot;k&quot;).
==Bases==
An ordered basis for &quot;V&quot; is said to be adapted to a flag &quot;V&quot;0 ⊂ &quot;V&quot;1 ⊂ ... ⊂ &quot;V&quot;&quot;k&quot; if the first &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; basis vectors form a basis for &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; for each 0 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;k&quot;. Standard arguments from linear algebra can show that any flag has an adapted basis.

Any ordered basis gives rise to a complete flag by letting the &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; be the span of the first &quot;i&quot; basis vectors. For example, the in R&quot;n&quot; is induced from the standard basis (&quot;e&quot;1, ..., &quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot;) where &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; denotes the vector with a 1 in the &quot;i&quot;th entry and 0&#x27;s elsewhere. Concretely, the standard flag is the sequence of subspaces:
:formula_3

An adapted basis is almost never unique (the counterexamples are trivial); see below.

A complete flag on an inner product space has an essentially unique orthonormal basis: it is unique up to multiplying each vector by a unit (scalar of unit length, e.g. 1, −1, &quot;i&quot;). Such a basis can be constructed using the Gram-Schmidt process. The uniqueness up to units follows inductively, by noting that formula_4 lies in the one-dimensional space formula_5.

More abstractly, it is unique up to an action of the maximal torus: the flag corresponds to the Borel group, and the inner product corresponds to the maximal compact subgroup.

==Stabilizer==
The stabilizer subgroup of the standard flag is the group of invertible upper triangular matrices.

More generally, the stabilizer of a flag (the linear operators formula_6 on &quot;V&quot; such that formula_7 for all &quot;i&quot;) is, in matrix terms, the algebra of block upper triangular matrices (with respect to an adapted basis), where the block sizes formula_8. The stabilizer subgroup of a complete flag is the set of invertible upper triangular matrices with respect to any basis adapted to the flag. The subgroup of lower triangular matrices with respect to such a basis depends on that basis, and can therefore &quot;not&quot; be characterized in terms of the flag only.

The stabilizer subgroup of any complete flag is a Borel subgroup (of the general linear group), and the stabilizer of any partial flags is a parabolic subgroup.

The stabilizer subgroup of a flag acts simply transitively on adapted bases for the flag, and thus these are not unique unless the stabilizer is trivial. That is a very exceptional circumstance: it happens only for a vector space of dimension 0, or for a vector space over formula_9 of dimension 1 (precisely the cases where only one basis exists, independently of any flag).

==Subspace nest==
In an infinite-dimensional space &quot;V&quot;, as used in functional analysis, the flag idea generalises to a subspace nest, namely a collection of subspaces of &quot;V&quot; that is a total order for inclusion and which further is closed under arbitrary intersections and closed linear spans. See nest algebra.

==Set-theoretic analogs==

From the point of view of the field with one element, a set can be seen as a vector space over the field with one element: this formalizes various analogies between Coxeter groups and algebraic groups.

Under this correspondence, an ordering on a set corresponds to a maximal flag: an ordering is equivalent to a maximal filtration of a set. For instance, the filtration (flag) formula_10 corresponds to the ordering formula_11.

<doc id="390647" wikidata="Q1147441" url="?curid=390647" title="North Borneo">
<text>North Borneo (usually known as British North Borneo, also known as the State of North Borneo) was a British protectorate in the northern part of the island of Borneo, (present-day Sabah). The territory of North Borneo was originally established by concessions of the Sultanates of Brunei and Sulu in 1877 and 1878 to a German-born representative of Austria-Hungary, businessman and diplomat, Gustav Overbeck.

Overbeck had recently purchased a small tract of land on the western coast of Borneo in 1876 from American merchant Joseph William Torrey, who had promoted the territory in Hong Kong since 1866. Overbeck then transferred all his rights to Alfred Dent before withdrawing in 1879. In 1881, Dent established the North Borneo Provisional Association Ltd to manage the territory, which was granted a royal charter in the same year. The following year, the Provisional Association was replaced by the North Borneo Chartered Company. The granting of a royal charter worried both the neighbouring Spanish and Dutch authorities; as a result, the Spanish began to stake their claim of northern Borneo. A protocol known as the Madrid Protocol was signed in 1885 to recognise Spanish presence in the Philippine archipelago, in return establishing the definite border of Spanish influence beyond northern Borneo. To avoid further claims from other European powers, North Borneo was made a British protectorate in 1888.

As the population was too small to effectively serve the economy, the British sponsored various migration schemes for Chinese workers from Hong Kong and China to work in the European plantations, and for Japanese immigrants to participate in the economic activities of North Borneo. The start of World War II with the arrival of Japanese forces brought an end to protectorate administration, with the territory placed under a military administration and then designated as a Crown colony.

== History ==
=== Foundation and early years ===

North Borneo was founded in 1877–1878 through a series of land concessions in northern Borneo from the Sultanate of Brunei and Sulu to an Austrian-German businessman and diplomat, Gustav Overbeck. A former American Trading Company of Borneo territory on the western coast of northern Borneo had already passed to Overbeck, requiring him to go to Brunei to renew the concession of the land he bought from Joseph William Torrey. William Clark Cowie played an important role as a close friend of the Sultanate of Sulu in helping Overbeck to buy additional land on the eastern coast of Borneo. Meanwhile, the Sultanate of Bulungan&#x27;s influence also reached Tawau on the south-eastern coast, but came under the influence of the more powerful Sultanate of Sulu.

Following his success in leasing large tracts of land from both the western and eastern parts of northern Borneo, Overbeck went to Europe to promote the territory in Austria-Hungary and Italy as well as in his own country of Germany, but none showed any real interest. Only Great Britain, which had sought to control trade routes in the Far East since the 18th century, responded. The interest of the British was strengthened by their presence in the Crown Colony of Labuan since 1846. As a result, Overbeck received financial support from the British Dent brothers (Alfred Dent and Edward Dent) and diplomatic and military support from the British government. Following the support from Britain, a clause was included in the treaties that the ceded territories could not be sold or given to another party without the permission of the British government.

Unable to attract the interest of the governments of Austria, Italy and Germany, Overbeck withdrew in 1879; all his treaty rights with the Sultanates were transferred to Alfred Dent, who in 1881 formed the North Borneo Provisional Association Ltd with the support of countrymen Rutherford Alcock, Admiral Henry Keppel, Richard Biddulph Martin, Admiral Richard Mayne, and William Henry Read. The Provisional Association then applied to Queen Victoria for a royal charter, which was granted on 1 November 1881. William Hood Treacher was appointed as the first governor, and Kudat at the northern tip of Borneo was chosen as the Provisional Association administration capital. The granting of the royal charter had worried both the Dutch and the Spanish, who feared that Britain might threaten the position of their colonies.

In May 1882, the Provisional Association was replaced by the newly formed North Borneo Chartered Company, with Alcock acting as the first President and Dent becoming the company managing director. The administration is not considered a British acquisition of the territory, but rather a private enterprise with government guidelines to protect the territory from being encroached upon by other European powers. Under Governor Treacher, the company gained more territories on the western coast from the Sultanate of Brunei. The company subsequently acquired further sovereign and territorial rights from the Sultan of Brunei, expanding the territory under their control to the Putatan River (May 1884), the Padas district (November 1884), the Kawang River (February 1885), the Mantanani Islands (April 1885) and additional minor Padas territories (March 1898).

At the early stage of the administration, there was a claim in northern Borneo by the Spanish authorities in the Philippines, and an attempt to raise the Spanish flag over Sandakan was met with interference by a British warship. To prevent further conflict and to end the Spanish claim to northern Borneo, in 1885 an agreement known as the Madrid Protocol was signed in Madrid between the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain, recognising the Spanish presence in the Philippine archipelago. As the company did not wish to be involved in further foreign affairs issues, North Borneo was made a British Protectorate on 12 May 1888. In 1890, the Crown Colony of Labuan was incorporated into the administration of North Borneo, before returning to direct British rule in 1904. There were several local insurrections from 1894 to 1900 by Mat Salleh and by Antanum in 1915. The First World War did not greatly affect the territory, and logging business grew during the interwar period.

=== World War II and decline ===
During World War II, the Japanese invasion of Borneo began with the unopposed landing of the Japanese forces at Miri and Seria on 16 December 1941, with the objective of securing oil supplies. On 1 January 1942, the Japanese navy landed unopposed in Labuan. The next day, the Japanese landed at Mempakul in North Borneo. After negotiations with the Officers-in-charge of Jesselton for its surrender, while they were waiting for troop reinforcements, Jesselton was occupied by the Japanese on 8 January. Another Japanese army detachment arrived from Mindanao and began to land on Tarakan Island, before proceeding to Sandakan on 17 January. The Japanese arrival was met with no strong resistance, as the protectorate mainly relied on the Royal Navy for defence. Although North Borneo had a police force, it never had its own army or navy. By the end of January, North Borneo was completely occupied by the Japanese. It was administered as part of the Empire of Japan, with the officers of the chartered company being allowed to continued administration under Japanese supervision.

The arrival of the Japanese forces to Borneo and the fall of Anglo-Japanese Alliance had already been predicted by revelation through secret telegrams that Japanese ships docked regularly at Jesselton were engaged in espionage. Many of the British and Australian soldiers captured after the fall of Malaya and Singapore were brought to North Borneo and held as prisoners of wars (POWs) in Sandakan camp where they were then forced to march from Sandakan to Ranau. Other POWs were also sent to Batu Lintang camp in neighbouring Sarawak. The occupation drove residents in the coastal areas to the interior in search of food and to escape the brutality of the war period, which led to the creation of several resistance movements; one of the such movement known as the Kinabalu Guerrillas which was led by Albert Kwok and supported by indigenous groups in North Borneo.

As part of the Allied Campaign to retake their possessions in the East, Allied forces deployed to Borneo under the Borneo campaign to liberate the island. The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) played a significant part in the mission, with the force being sent to Tarakan and Labuan islands to secure eastern and western Borneo. The Allied Z Special Unit provided intelligence and other information from the Japanese that facilitated the AIF landings, while US submarines were used to transport Australian commandos to Borneo. Most of the major towns of North Borneo were heavily bombed during this period. The war ended on 15 August 1945 following the Japanese surrender and the administration of North Borneo was undertaken by the British Military Administration (BMA) from September. The company official administration returned to administer the territory but, unable to finance the reconstruction cost after the war, ceded administration of the protectorate to the crown colony government on 15 July 1946.

== Government ==
The Chartered Company&#x27;s system of administration was based on standard British colonial empire administrative structure, with the land divided into Residencies, and sub-divided into districts. Initially, there were only two Residencies: East Coast and West Coast, with Residents based at Sandakan and Jesselton respectively. Each Residency was divided into provinces, later known as districts, which were run by district officers. By 1922, there were five Residencies to accommodate new areas that were opened up for development. These were the West Coast, Kudat, Tawau, Interior and East Coast Residencies. These Residencies were in turn divided into 17 districts. Under this system, British held top posts, while native chiefs managed the people at lower levels. This was not a conscious attempt by the British to instill indirect rule but a convenient arrangement for the district officers who were unfamiliar with local customs and politics.

The company administration established a foundation for economic growth in North Borneo by restoring peace to a land where piracy and tribal feuds had grown rampant. It abolished slavery and set up transport, health and education services for the people, and allowed indigenous communities to continue their traditional lifestyles. The British North Borneo Constabulary, the territory&#x27;s police force, in 1883 comprised 3 Europeans, 50 Indians (Punjabis and Pashtuns), 30 Dayaks, 50 Somalis and 20 Malays. Constables trained at depot an average of three days per week. In 1884 the force had a total of 176 members, which increased to about 510 over three years. While under the protectorate, international relations were managed by the British government, internally North Borneo was governed by the North Borneo Chartered Company as an independent state with British protection. The treaty signed on 12 May 1888 stipulated:


I. The State of North Borneo comprises the territories specified in the said Royal Charter, and such other territories as the Company have acquired, or may hereafter acquire, ‘under the provisions of Article XV of the said Charter.

== Economy ==

With the beginning of planned economic activities under British administration, the North Borneo authorities began to open land for agriculture, and native land rights began to be formed. The government however felt that the native population was too small and unsuited to meet the requirements of modern development, so they began to sponsor various schemes for the migration of Chinese workers from Hong Kong and China. In 1882, the North Borneo authorities appointed Walter Henry Medhurst as Commissioner for Chinese Immigration with the mission of attracting more businessmen to invest in North Borneo by providing a workforce. Medhurst&#x27;s efforts were costly and unsuccessful; however, the Hakka, not part of the plan, began to migrate to North Borneo where they formed an agricultural community.


Since the 18th century, tobacco was North Borneo&#x27;s foremost planting industry. The logging history in North Borneo can be traced since the 1870s. From 1890s, hardwood exports increased, with logging expanding during the interwar period. In the 1900s, North Borneo joined the rubber boom. The completion of North Borneo Railway Line helped to transport the resources to a major port on the west coast. By 1915, around of land, in addition to Chinese and North Borneo smallholdings, had been planted with rubber tree. In the same year, the Governor of North Borneo, Aylmer Cavendish Pearson invited Japanese emigrants to participate in the economic activities there. The Japanese government received the request warmly and sent researchers to discover potential economic opportunities.

At the early stage, the Japanese encouraged their farmers to go to North Borneo to cultivate rice, as their country depended on rice imports. With increasing economic interest from the Japanese, they purchased a rubber estate owned by the North Borneo government. By 1937, North Borneo exported 178,000 cubic metres of timber, surpassing Siam, which exporting 85,000 cubic metres of timber. Many of the privately owned Japanese estates and companies had been involved in the economic sectors of North Borneo since being invited by the British. With the increasing numbers of Japanese investments, many Japanese also migrated with their family to the east coast of North Borneo, primarily to Tawau and Kunak.

=== Currency ===
The original monetary unit of North Borneo was the Mexican dollar. The dollar was later matched to the Straits dollar and rated at 9 Straits dollars (equal to 5 US dollars at the time). Different notes were issued throughout the administration, with backgrounds featuring the Mount Kinabalu or the company arms.

=== Demography ===
In 1881, 60,000 to 100,000 indigenous people lived in North Borneo. The people on the coast were mainly Muslims, with the aborigines mostly located inland. The Kadazan-Dusun and Murut were the largest indigenous group in the interior, while Bajau, Bruneian, Illanun, Kedayan and Suluk dominated the coastal areas. Following various immigration schemes initiated by the British, the population increased to 200,000 in 1920, 257,804 in 1930, 285,000 in 1935, and 331,000 in 1945. Under company rule, the government of North Borneo not only recruited Chinese workers but also Japanese immigrants to overcome the shortage of manpower in the economic sectors. From 1911 until 1951, the total of Chinese population increased from only 27,801 to 74,374 which is divided between Hakka (44,505), Cantonese (11,833), Hokkien (7,336), Teochew (3,948), some Hailam (Hainan) (3,571) and other Chinese groups (3,181).

=== Public service infrastructure ===
North Borneo was connected to the Singapore-Hongkong submarine cable by a link from the island of Labuan to Menumbok. The first message from the Borneo mainland to London was sent on 19 May 1894. A few days later, the work on a telegraph line from the West Coast to Sandakan was started. It took three years and exacted a heavy toll in human life to push the line through the almost uninhabited interior territory, until on 7 April 1897 a congratulatory message from the Governor in Sandakan for transmission to the Court of Directors in London was successfully transmitted from Sandakan to Labuan. In the early 1910s the technical and financial problems with the telegraph line prompted the company to venture into the construction of a wireless network, based on the quench-spark system of the German Telefunken Company. The first stage of this network comprised stations in Sandakan, Jesselton, Tawau and Kudat. The first wireless communication was established on 24 October 1913 between British North Borneo and Jolo on the Philippine Islands. Inland communication was effected on 14 January 1914 between Sandakan and Jesselton.

The North Borneo Railway opened to the public on 1 August 1914 as the main transportation facility for west coast communities. Postal service was also available throughout the administration.

=== Media ===
The &quot;Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society&quot; (since 1820), &quot;The London Gazette&quot; (since 1881), and &quot;British North Borneo Herald&quot; (since 1883) held a significant amount of records regarding North Borneo before and during the British administration.

<text>Friedrich Julius Reubke (23 March 18343 June 1858) was a German composer, pianist and organist. In his short life, he composed the &quot;Sonata on the 94th Psalm&quot; in C minor, which is considered to be one of the greatest organ works in the romantic repertoire.

==Biography==

Born in Hausneindorf, a small village in the region of the Harz Mountains, Julius Reubke was the eldest son of organ and piano builder Adolf Reubke (1805-1875). Of Julius&#x27;s five siblings, two brothers, Emil (1836–1884) and Karl (1840–1860), worked with their father; Emil became a partner in 1860 and owned the company from 1872. His brother Otto (1842–1913) was also a pianist, organist and composer; he prepared the &quot;Sonata on the 94th Psalm&quot; for its first publication in August 1871. Otto settled in Halle, where he was a professor at the University of Halle, and became its director in 1892. There were also two sisters, Meta and Alma.

Reubke&#x27;s first musical instruction was in Quedlinburg with Hermann Bönicke (1821–1879). He moved to Berlin in April or October 1851, where he continued his musical education at the conservatory there, which had been founded in November 1850 by Theodor Kullak, with whom he studied piano, Adolf Bernhard Marx, with whom he studied composition, and Julius Stern. In Berlin, he encountered the Neudeutsche Schule with conductor Hans von Bülow and organist Alexander Winterberger, both associated with Franz Liszt.

When Liszt visited Berlin in December 1855, he arranged, on the recommendation of Bülow, to teach Reubke piano and composition from February 1856 in Weimar, and allowed him to live at the Altenburg house he kept. It was in this environment that Reubke composed his two major works, the Piano Sonata in B-flat minor, which he composed from December 1856 to March 1857, and the &quot;Sonata on the 94th Psalm&quot; in C minor, for organ, which he finished a month later; he also considered writing an opera. The organ sonata was dedicated to Professor Carl Riedel; its premiere was by Reubke on the Ladegast organ (1853-1855) of Merseburg Cathedral on 17 June 1857. Since its composition, it has been considered one of the pinnacles of the Romantic repertoire.

His health was already in decline at the time of his great compositions: 

He moved to Dresden in December 1857. By this time, he was suffering from worsening tuberculosis, and did not have the energy to play or compose. He moved to the health resort at Pillnitz in May 1858, where he died at the &quot;Zum Goldenen Löwen&quot; inn a few days later, at the age of 24. He was buried near the church of Maria am Wasser in Pillnitz-Hosterwitz on 7 June.

He was one of Liszt&#x27;s favourite pupils; after his death, Liszt wrote a letter of sympathy to Reubke&#x27;s father:

<text>King William Street was the original but short-lived northern terminus of the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR), the first successful deep-level underground railway in London and one of the component parts of the London Underground&#x27;s Northern line. It was located in the City of London, on King William Street, just south of the present Monument station. When King William Street was in operation the next station to the south was Borough and the southern terminus of the line was Stockwell.

The station was short-lived, in operation for less than ten years. It was named after the street above, which in turn was named after King William IV.

London Transport Museum runs regular virtual tours of the station through its &quot;Hidden London&quot; programme. The tour also explores how the Bank redevelopment project utilised the original 1890 station to build the current platforms and passageways.

==History==

King William Street opened on 18 December 1890 and was constructed from a large masonry station tunnel, accessed from the surface by a lift shaft or spiral staircase. Two platforms were provided, one on each side of the single, central track — one for passengers entering and the other for passengers leaving the trains — a system later referred to as the Spanish solution. The station tunnel itself is situated beneath Monument Street and runs east–west across King William Street, ending beneath Arthur Street. The approach running tunnels had tight curves and steep gradients in order to pass underneath the River Thames while following underneath public roads, especially Swan Lane and Arthur Street. The combination of station layout and poor alignment of the running tunnels severely limited the capacity of the station and, in the years after opening, a number of initiatives were made to improve operations. In 1895, a central island platform with tracks each side was constructed to enable two trains to occupy the station at once; however, capacity was still restricted.

When the line was extended northwards to Moorgate, new running tunnels on a different alignment, but still running beneath Borough High Street, were constructed running from below St George the Martyr&#x27;s church, north of Borough station, to a new station at London Bridge and onwards to an alternative City station at Bank. Under the Thames, the present running tunnels of the Northern line are situated to the east of London Bridge, whereas the King William Street tunnels pass to the west of the bridge, with the southbound tunnel below the northbound track as the line passes under the Thames.

The station closed from Monday 26 February 1900 when the Moorgate extension opened.

The original station building was demolished in the 1930s, although the parts of the station below ground were converted for use as a public air-raid shelter during World War II. Access today is via a manhole in the basement of Regis House, a contemporary office building, where the original cast iron spiral staircase leads down to platform level. The lift shaft was filled in with concrete during the construction of the original Regis House. The original running tunnels north of Borough station remain, although when the Jubilee line extension was built in the late 1990s, the old southbound tunnel was cut through as part of the construction works at London Bridge station in order to provide the lift shaft situated at the south end of the Northern line platforms. These running tunnels are now used as a ventilation shaft for the station and the openings for several adits to the old running tunnels can be seen in the roofs of the Northern line platform tunnels and in the central concourse between them. A construction shaft between London Bridge and King William Street, beneath Old Swan Wharf, now functions as a pump shaft for the disused sections of the running tunnels. It is no longer possible to walk through between the two stations as the old C&amp;SLR running tunnels have been blocked off with concrete bulkheads on both sides of the Thames. The tunnels were further severed by upgrades to Bank station, as the construction shaft for the new Northern line tunnel, located in Arthur Street, cuts straight through the approach tunnel to King William Street station, with the station site itself linked to the new tunnel via a ventilation adit.

<doc id="390675" wikidata="Q9022829" url="?curid=390675" title="Lionel, LLC">
<text>Lionel, LLC is an American designer and importer of toy trains and model railroads that is headquartered in Concord, North Carolina. Its roots lie in the 1969 purchase of the Lionel product line from the Lionel Corporation by cereal conglomerate General Mills and subsequent purchase in 1986 by businessman Richard P. Kughn forming Lionel Trains, Inc. in 1986. The Martin Davis Investment Group (Wellspring) bought Lionel Trains, Inc. in 1995 and renamed it Lionel, LLC.

According to its reorganization papers filed as part of its bankruptcy plan on May 21, 2007, about 95% of the company&#x27;s sales come from O gauge trains. The plan estimated that about US$70 million worth of O gauge trains are sold each year, and that Lionel accounts for about 60% of that market, making it the largest manufacturer of O gauge trains.

== Lionel Racing ==
In late 2010, Lionel, LLC entered a joint venture with NASCAR Team Properties to produce NASCAR diecast vehicles that are both 1:24 and 1:64 scale. In 2013, Lionel would acquire full ownership and rename it to Lionel Racing. Lionel has also produced NHRA and ARCA diecast. In 2016, Lionel Racing took over distribution of the NASCAR Authentics line from Spin Master which consists of 1:64 diecast models of NASCAR race cars that are found inside major stores like Target, Walmart, Meijer, and Toys “R” Us. 

==Lionel Eras==
===Early history===
The original Lionel Corporation was founded in 1900 by Joshua Lionel Cowen and Harry C. Grant in New York City. Cowen designed his first train, the No. 5 electric locomotive, not as a toy, but as an eye-catching display for toy stores. 

===MPC/General Mills era (1970–1986)===
Lionel Corporation sold the tooling for its then-current product line and licensed the Lionel name to General Mills in 1969, who then operated Lionel as a division of its subsidiary &quot;Model Products Corporation&quot;, or MPC, beginning in 1970. General Mills did not buy the company, however. The Lionel Corporation became a holding company and invested in a number of ventures, including what would eventually become an East Coast chain of toy stores known as &quot;Lionel Leisure World&quot;.

Lionel struck a deal with General Mills to lease the Lionel name for ten years starting in 1970. This deal included the purchase of a portion of the Lionel tooling and as part of the agreement, production &amp; sale of the 1969 train product line would be handled by the Lionel Corporation. The balance of the tooling was purchased on December 31, 1969. The lease was renegotiated in 1974.

Due to General Mills&#x27; cost-cutting measures, production of Lionel-branded toy and model trains returned to profitability, but sometimes at the expense of quality. Detail was often sacrificed, and most of the remaining metal parts were replaced with molded plastic. A number of MPC&#x27;s changes to the product line endure to the present day, the most noticeable being the use of needlepoint axles and trucks made of Delrin, two changes made to reduce friction and allow longer trains. Also starting in 1973, MPC experimented with a line of cars it called &quot;Standard O,&quot; which were scaled to 1:48 (most postwar Lionel and MPC production was undersize for O scale). The experiment&#x27;s failure is generally blamed on MPC&#x27;s lack of a 1:48 locomotive and caboose to go with the cars; when it was repeated in the 1980s with locomotives of appropriate size, it proved more successful.

An internal reorganization after 1973 caused Lionel to become part of General Mills&#x27; Fundimensions group. Although Lionel&#x27;s tenure with MPC was relatively short, &quot;MPC&quot; is the most commonly used term for the 1970–1985 era.

In 1979, General Mills resurrected the American Flyer brand and product line, which Lionel Corporation had originally purchased in 1967 from its bankrupt competitor (The A. C. Gilbert Company of New Haven, Connecticut). American Flyer products by Gilbert made after World War II are scaled roughly to a 1:64 proportion and are known as S gauge; their most distinctive feature, however, is that they operate on two-rail track as opposed to Lionel&#x27;s three-rail trackage system.

After a period of time of absence in the market, Gilbert American Flyer S gauge trains were no longer considered a direct competitor to Lionel&#x27;s 1:48 proportion O gauge trains. To this day, Lionel markets American Flyer S gauge in limited quantities for the operator and collector markets.

The year 1982 brought General Mills&#x27; poorly received move of train production from the United States to Mexico. Some Lionel fans were angry simply because the trains had been made in the United States for more than 80 years, while others criticized the quality of the Mexican-produced trains. Lionel production returned to the United States by 1984. During this time, corporate offices were retained at the company&#x27;s Mount Clemens (later, Chesterfield), Michigan, location.

When General Mills spun off its Kenner-Parker division in 1985, Lionel became part of Kenner-Parker. The Lionel product line was sold again in 1986, this time to toy-train collector and real estate developer Richard P. Kughn of Detroit, Michigan, who formed Lionel Trains, Inc. (LTI).

===Lionel Trains, Inc./Richard Kughn era (1986–1995)===
In 1986, Detroit-based real estate developer (and railroad enthusiast) Richard Kughn bought the brand and established Lionel Trains, Inc.

In 1989, Lionel, LLC made the switch from the MPC Sound of Steam to the new and improved Railsounds 1.0, heralding a new era of high-tech audio realism. Some of the engines to get this new sound system were the A6 switcher, Reading T1, and the New York Central Mohawk. In 1995, Lionel introduced the Trainmaster Command Control (TMCC) system along with the fully digital Railsounds 2.5. Engines that got this control and sound system were mostly Hudsons, like the 1995 Lionel No. 490 C&amp;O Hudson, the 1995 Boston and Albany 618 Hudson, and the 1996 Lionel Commodore Vanderbilt. Others soon followed like the articulated engines in 1999 and 2000.

In 1991, the most popular toy train, the Santa Fe F3 was reintroduced with RailSounds. In 1992 Richard Kughn and musician Neil Young, an avid model railroader, created Liontech, chartered to develop exclusive new model train control and sound systems. Liontech&#x27;s RailSounds II debuted in 1994.

In 1994, TMCC (Trainmaster Command Control), the brainchild of Neil Young, was introduced. Abbreviated as TMCC, it is a technology similar to Digital Command Control which permits, among other things, the operation of Lionel trains by remote control. This allowed collectors to walk around their layout while still being in control of their trains. It introduced new features like whistle, bell, chugging, diesel roar, electro-couplers, and the ability to turn RailSounds on or off.

Richard Kughn sold Lionel in 1995 to the Martin Davis Investment Group (Wellspring), which owned Lionel, LLC from 1995 to 2000 before giving the CEO rights to Richard Maddox.

===Wellspring era (1995–present)===
Lionel changed hands again in 1995, when Kughn sold controlling interest in the company to an investment group that included Neil Young and the holding company Wellspring Capital Management, which was headed by former Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) chairman Martin Davis (he had left the board of Viacom, which bought Paramount the previous year). The new company became known as Lionel, LLC. The company continued marketing reproductions of its vintage equipment, and the trend towards producing new equipment that was ever-more-detailed continued. Young now had a 20% stake in the company.

In order to proliferate Trainmaster Command Control as a standard, Lionel licensed it to several of its competitors, including K-Line. Lionel, LLC continued to manufacture and market trains and accessories in O scale under the Lionel brand and S gauge under the American Flyer brand. While most of the American Flyer products are re-issues using old Gilbert tooling from the 1950s, the O scale equipment is a combination of new designs and reissues.

In 1996 and 1997, the Lionel Century Club was unveiled to the public. It featured the 726 Berkshire, the GG-1, the 773 Hudson, the NYC F3, and the Pennsy O-27 scale turbine. All retained their postwar look with the latest technology at the time. In 1998, Century Club II was announced and released with one of the engines being a NYC 4-8-4 Niagara with cab number No. 6024.

Also in 1997 and 1998, the Postwar Celebration Series began. This series featured postwar trains, accessories, transformers, and cars retaining postwar looks with the latest technologies. The series lasted from 1997–2011.

In 1999 and 2000, there was big demand for high-end articulated steam engines. In 1999, Lionel, LLC manufactured the first three articulated steam engines. Those three are the N&amp;W A Class, The Allegheny, and the Big Boy, manufactured in early 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. Since 1998, Lionel has made more than 10 different types of articulated steam engines.

Lionel made a gold and platinum plated 700E hudson to celebrate their centennial in 2000. It featured Trainmaster command control, Railsounds, and Electrocouplers.

In 1999, The Texas Special was fitted with RailSounds and critics pointed out that it had the best diesel horn Lionel ever produced. The set came with a powered A-unit, a non-powered B-unit, a non-powered A-unit, two coach cars, a dome car, and an observation car. The train came in a Lionel Postwar Celebration Series box and was a TMCC engine.

In April 2000, competitor and former partner MTH Electric Trains filed a trade secret misappropriation lawsuit against Lionel, LLC, saying that one of Lionel&#x27;s subcontractors had acquired plans for an MTH locomotive design and used them to design locomotives for Lionel. The suit eventually went to trial, and on June 7, 2004, a jury in Detroit, Michigan, found Lionel liable and awarded MTH US$40,775,745. Lionel announced it would appeal, and two weeks later filed for bankruptcy, citing the judgment as the main reason. On November 1, 2004, a federal judge upheld the jury&#x27;s decision. On December 14, 2006, the judgment was overturned on appeal, citing legal mistakes in the jury trial, and a new trial was ordered.

In 2001, Lionel closed its last manufacturing plant in the United States, outsourcing production to Korea and China. While this move proved unpopular with some longtime fans, the backlash was minor in comparison to the failed move of production to Mexico in the 1980s. The company also licensed the Lionel name to numerous third parties, who have marketed various Lionel-branded products since 1995.

In early 2002, Lionel decided to put out fantastic models in black boxes that read &quot;Joshua Lionel Cowen Series&quot;. The JLC Series ran from 2002–2012 as a 10-year anniversary for Lionel&#x27;s first CEO and president, Joshua Lionel Cowen. It became a hit with collectors.

In 2003, Lionel made RailSounds sets for the first time under NYC and Santa Fe Railroads. In 2006, TMCC was phased out when Lionel unveiled their new &quot;Legacy&quot; system.

On May 27, 2004, Union Pacific Railroad sued Athearn (another manufacturer of model railroad equipment) and Lionel for trademark infringement. The railroad claimed both companies put the names and logos of UP, as well as the names and logos of various fallen flag railroads UP had acquired over the years, on their model railroad products without a license. While Athearn quickly settled and acquired a license, Lionel initially resisted, arguing that it and its predecessor companies had been using the logos for more than 50 years, and had been encouraged or even paid to do so. On September 13, 2006, Lionel and UP settled the suit for US$640,000 plus a royalty on future sales.

In September 2004, the company dismissed its CEO, Bill Bracy, and replaced him with Jerry Calabrese, a former Marvel Entertainment and NASCAR executive. Along with Bracy, another 17 high-level employees were also dismissed.

In July 2005, Lionel sued competitor K-Line for theft of trade secrets. The two companies settled out of court but the settlement quickly fell apart, leading to K-Line declaring bankruptcy and selling its assets to Sanda Kan, a Chinese subcontractor who did manufacturing for both K-Line and Lionel. In January 2006, Sanda Kan licensed the K-Line name and intellectual property to Lionel.

On March 27, 2008, a bankruptcy judge approved Lionel&#x27;s reorganization plan, including a settlement with MTH. Although the specifics were to remain sealed, the Associated Press reported that Lionel settled with MTH for US$12 million.

The 2004 Christmas movie &quot;Polar Express&quot;, based on the children&#x27;s book of the same name, provided Lionel with its first hit in years. Lionel produced a train set based on the movie, and stronger-than-anticipated demand caused highly publicized shortages. Various news stories told of a reporter&#x27;s quest to locate a set, and some dealers marked the prices up above the suggested retail price of US$229. Sets turned up on eBay with buy-now prices of $449 as Lionel ordered an additional production run but said it would not be able to deliver the additional sets until March of the following year. The set remains a popular seller in the product line in 2012.

In 2006, the Lionel electric train was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame, along with the Easy-Bake Oven. It was the first time an electric toy had ever been inducted. That same year, Lionel made a bigger push to sell its train sets outside of hobby shops, selling them in stores such as FAO Schwarz, Macy&#x27;s, and Target. By November 2006, the company had turned a US$760,000 profit on sales of US$55 million.

In 2009, Lionel launched a series of the most highly detailed model trains they have ever made called Visionline. The latest addition to Visionline is the GS series of steam locomotives.

In 2010, Lionel decided to remove RailSounds from train sets, using basic TrainSounds instead. In 2013, Lionel introduced &quot;LionChief&quot; Remote control trains to introduce wireless remote control to their starter sets. These sets feature enhanced sounds and long distance wireless control. In 2013, Lionel RailSounds sets were discontinued when Lionel unveiled the LionChief system. In 2014, Lionel revealed LionChief Plus as a new standard for their train sets.

In April 2014, Jerry Calabrese stepped down as president and CEO and was replaced by Howard Hitchcock, former senior vice president and general manager. In August of that year, Lionel moved their service center to their headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In July 2016, Lionel re-entered into the HO scale market for the first time since 1990 by introducing the Polar Express in HO. In 2020, a large expansion to Lionel&#x27;s HO scale lineup happened when they released a 2-8-2 Mikado and many other stock products.

In 2021, Lionel moved their main manufacturing plant from China to Vietnam. 

==Bankruptcy==
On November 15, 2004, Lionel, LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing the US$40 million-plus judgment in the MTH lawsuit as the primary factor. In the filing, it listed $55 million in debt and $42 million in assets. The largest secured creditor was PNC Financial Services Corp., owed $31 million. The MTH judgment was not included in the $55 million figure. On July 26, 2006, Lionel&#x27;s bankruptcy judge ordered that Lionel submit a plan for emerging from bankruptcy within 75 days of the appeals court&#x27;s verdict on the MTH lawsuit. On December 14, 2006, a federal appeals court determined that the company was entitled to a new trial, and that their reorganized plan should be filed by March 1, 2007.

Subsequently, on March 27, 2008 Judge Burton R. Lifland, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, approved Lionel LLC&#x27;s Chapter 11 reorganization plan, clearing the way for the company to exit bankruptcy. According to Lionel chief executive Jerry Calabrese, the plan called for the company to pay all its creditors in full with interest, whilst the company itself would also obtain up to US$40 million in loans to fund its exit from Chapter 11, pay off its creditors and fund its working capital needs in the future.

In regard to the MTH lawsuit, recent filings revealed Lionel agreed to pay MTH $12 million in cash to settle the lawsuit and a separate suit involving patented smoke-puffing technology.

Lionel&#x27;s Chapter 11 plan also called for private equity firm Guggenheim Partners to contribute $37.1 million to the reorganized Lionel company, which consequently would now own 48.6 percent of the new Lionel. Similarly, the plan also called for the estate of the deceased Martin S. Davis (former chairman of Gulf+Western Industries/Paramount Communications Inc.) to provide $21.9 million to Lionel, and the Davis estate would now have a 28.6 percent share in the reorganized company. Guggenheim Partners&#x27;s and the Davis estate&#x27;s funding totaled $59 million for the reorganization plan; they would also loan Lionel an additional $10 million in second-lien debt. As a result, Calabrese expected the company to be out of bankruptcy &quot;within a week&quot;.

Following the reorganization plan, Young was no longer a minority shareholder in the Lionel company; however, Calabrese insisted that the company wanted him to remain involved, claiming that he would have an &quot;ongoing role in the company&quot;, but that this role would be &quot;up to [Neil]&quot;. The pair organized a meeting on March 28, 2008. As of 2012, Young remains an active consultant in the company&#x27;s Legacy and other high-end products.

On May 1, 2008, Lionel was fully out of bankruptcy.

==Collector value==

Lionel trains are often sought by collectors, but the value of each piece can vary greatly. In general, older pieces tend to be more sought after due to age, rarity and nostalgia. The collector value of &quot;modern era&quot; Lionel trains has been limited by comparison to the trains produced by Lionel Corporation prior to 1969. As another generation grows nostalgic for this era, values may increase. As with any collectible, condition and rarity are important in assessing value. In addition, reissues and reproductions by Lionel and others have somewhat decreased the collector value and made it more difficult to authenticate vintage Lionel and American Flyer equipment. There are numerous collectors guides to help buyers make informed decisions on authenticity and value.

Currently, Lionel markets its products to several levels of skills and budget. As in the past, the higher-end, limited run products tend to retain the highest collectible value for the future. These products include the Legacy equipped steam and diesel locomotives which are accurate and highly detailed scale models. Lionel introduced the Vision Line of locomotives and cars in 2009, with the goal of providing the most innovative and detailed O gauge models available. Ready-to-run sets and cars are also offered at lower price points. These sets are in the tradition of, and many are reproductions of, the entry-level sets of the classic Lionel era. In March 2012, Lionel released the first American Flyer exclusive catalog, featuring many all-new models with advanced electronic features and increased scale compatibility.

Lionel also produces lines for children, including battery-powered G scale trains and &quot;Little Lines&quot; sets for children as young as four.

==Lionel Collectors Club of America==
In 1974, the LCCA was created in Des Moines, Iowa, with 83 other charter members. The club mainly focuses on having members show an interest in Lionel trains with train meets, swap meets, and annual conventions. In 2012, the LCCA and the Lionel Railroaders Club (LRRC) merged, with LCCA as the name of the combined group. Before the merger, one membership was needed to receive publications by LCCA and another separate membership was needed to attend the annual conventions in the summer. After the merger, they changed the arrangement so that junior membership and regular membership can get the publications and the invitation to the annual conventions with just one membership instead of two.

<doc id="390676" wikidata="Q236821" url="?curid=390676" title="Silent Hill">
<text>is a horror media franchise centered on a series of survival horror games created by Keiichiro Toyama and published by Konami. The first four main games—&quot;Silent Hill&quot;, &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;, &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot;, and &quot;Silent Hill 4: The Room&quot;—were developed by Team Silent, a development staff within the former Konami subsidiary Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo from 1999 to 2004.

The franchise is primarily set in the fictional town of Silent Hill, a place plagued by supernatural events, and follows various characters drawn to the town, where they encounter horrifying creatures, psychological torment, and mysteries tied to their own pasts.

The next three mainline games—&quot;Origins&quot;, &quot;Homecoming&quot;, and &quot;Downpour&quot;—were developed by other, mostly Western, developers and released between 2007 and 2012. The &quot;Silent Hill&quot; franchise has expanded to include various print pieces, two feature films, and spin-off video games. As of 2013, the game series has sold over 8.4 million copies worldwide. Since 2022, Konami has embarked on a series of projects in the series including games &quot;Silent Hill: The Short Message&quot;, the 2024 remake of &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;, and the upcoming &quot;Silent Hill f&quot;, with various spin-offs releasing during the two periods. 

Most games are set in the fictional American town of Silent Hill. The series is heavily influenced by the literary genre of psychological horror, with its player characters being mostly &quot;everymen&quot;.

==Installment overview==
===Main series===
====&quot;Silent Hill&quot; (1999)====

The first installment in the series follows Harry Mason as he searches for his missing adopted daughter in the mysterious New England town of Silent Hill. Stumbling upon a cult conducting a ritual to revive a deity it worships, Harry discovers his daughter&#x27;s true origin. Multiple game endings are possible, depending on the in-game actions taken by the player. The game was released in 1999 for the PlayStation. In 2009, it became available for download from the European PlayStation Network store for the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Portable, and later, in the same year, from the North American PlayStation Network store.

====&quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; (2001)====

The second installment in the series follows James Sunderland as he searches for his deceased wife in Silent Hill after receiving a letter from her, informing him that she is waiting for him there. After searching and exploring the mysterious town, he ultimately realizes the true nature of her death. The game was released in September 2001 for the PlayStation 2. An extended version of the game was released for the Xbox in December of the same year as &quot;Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams&quot; in North America and &quot;Silent Hill 2: Inner Fears&quot; in Europe, and for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 as &quot;Silent Hill 2: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, with a port of &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; to Microsoft Windows released in February 2003.

====&quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; (2003)====

The third installment in the series follows a teenage girl named Heather as she becomes caught in a conflict within Silent Hill&#x27;s cult and discovers her true origin. It was released in May 2003 for the PlayStation 2, with a port to Microsoft Windows released in October of the same year. &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; is a direct sequel to the first installment in the series.

====&quot;Silent Hill 4: The Room&quot; (2004)====

The fourth installment in the series follows Henry Townshend, who finds himself locked in his apartment as strange phenomena begin to unfold around him and the other residents of the building. It was released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows, and it also marked the end of Team Silent&#x27;s contributions to the series.

====&quot;Silent Hill: Origins&quot; (2007)====

The fifth installment in the series is a prequel to &quot;Silent Hill&quot; that follows trucker Travis Grady, who becomes trapped in Silent Hill after rescuing a girl from a burning house. During his quest to discover the fate of the burned girl, he encounters characters from the first game and is forced to face his own past. It was developed by Climax Studios and released in 2007 for the PlayStation Portable, with a port for the PlayStation 2 released in 2008. This was also the first &quot;Silent Hill&quot; title developed outside Japan. It is known as &quot;Silent Hill Zero&quot; in Japan.

====&quot;Silent Hill: Homecoming&quot; (2008)====

The sixth installment in the series follows Alex Shepherd, a soldier who has returned from a war overseas. Upon his arrival, Alex discovers that his father has gone missing, his mother has become catatonic, and no one can provide the whereabouts of his younger brother, Joshua. The game chronicles Alex&#x27;s search to find his missing brother. It was developed by Double Helix Games and released in 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in 2009 for Microsoft Windows.

====&quot;Silent Hill: Downpour&quot; (2012)====

The seventh installment in the series follows Murphy Pendleton, a prisoner who becomes stranded in Silent Hill after his prison transport vehicle crashes. Announced in April 2010 and developed by Vatra Games for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the game was released on March 13, 2012. It is the only game in the series that can be played in stereoscopic 3D.

====&quot;Silent Hill ƒ&quot; (TBA)====

A new mainline game, entitled &quot;Silent Hill ƒ&quot;, was announced in October 2022. It is being developed by NeoBards, with creative contributions from writer Ryukishi07, character designer &quot;kera,&quot; and producer Motoi Okamoto. The game is set in Japan during the Shōwa period. The story is being written by Ryukishi07, who also wrote the &quot;When They Cry&quot; visual novel series.

=== Remakes ===

==== &quot;Silent Hill: Shattered Memories&quot; (2009) ====

&quot;Shattered Memories&quot; is a reimagining of the first installment, developed by Climax Studios for the Wii and released in December 2009, with ports for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable released in January 2010. The game retains the premise of the original—Harry Mason&#x27;s quest to find his missing daughter in the American town of Silent Hill—but is set in what appears to be a different fictional universe, following a different plot, with characters from the first game appearing altered alongside new ones.

Gameplay takes place in two parts: a framing, first-person psychotherapy session with an unseen patient, and an over-the-shoulder perspective of Harry&#x27;s journey through Silent Hill, which is periodically interrupted by environmental shifts where he is pursued by monsters.

&quot;Shattered Memories&quot;&#x27; gameplay focuses on the completion of psychological tests, which alter in-game elements in the first setting, and exploration, puzzle-solving, and monster evasion in the second setting. The game&#x27;s developers avoided integrating combat into the second setting&#x27;s gameplay, centering instead on a weaponless player character attempting to rescue himself from powerful opponents, as they considered this to be more fear-inducing. The game received generally positive reviews, with its graphics, storyline, voice acting, soundtrack, and use of the Wii Remote as the controller for the Wii version praised by reviewers. However, &quot;Shattered Memories&quot;&#x27; chase sequences were criticized by some reviewers, who deemed them potentially frustrating and short.

==== &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; (2024) ====

A remake of &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; was announced in October 2022 for the PlayStation 5 and PC. It will be a console exclusive on the PlayStation 5 for the first 12 months but will also be released for PC. Akira Yamaoka, the original composer, returned to write the score. The remake was released in October 2024.

=== Adaptations ===

==== &quot;Play Novel: Silent Hill&quot; (2001) ====
&quot;Play Novel: Silent Hill&quot; is a visual novel adaptation of the original &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, released exclusively for the Game Boy Advance in Japan on March 21, 2001. It has been fan-translated into English.

==== &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (mobile game) (2006) ====
&quot;Silent Hill&quot; (mobile game) is a mobile adaptation of the original &quot;Silent Hill&quot;. It was released in Japan for the FOMA phone on July 5, 2006, and for Java on January 17, 2007.

=== Compilations ===

==== &quot;The Silent Hill Collection&quot; (2006) ====
&quot;The Silent Hill Collection&quot; is a re-release of the first four mainline video games in the series for the PlayStation 2. The European release contains &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;, &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot;, and &quot;Silent Hill 4: The Room&quot;, while the Japanese release also includes the first &quot;Silent Hill&quot;.

==== &quot;Silent Hill HD Collection&quot; (2012) ====

&quot;Silent Hill HD Collection&quot; is a high-definition re-release of &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; and &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, featuring high-resolution visuals, new sounds, new voices, and Trophies/Achievements for both games. &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; includes the option to use both the old and new voices; however, &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; features only a new voice track, as the old voices were unavailable for legal reasons. &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; also features both the main scenario and the &quot;Born from a Wish&quot; sub-scenario, as seen in later re-releases such as the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;.

This collection marked the first time &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; was playable on an Xbox console. The collection received mixed to negative reviews due to severe issues with both games, such as significant framerate problems, lockups, and more. While the PlayStation 3 version was patched, the Xbox 360 patch was canceled, and Konami offered refunds to all Xbox 360 owners of the game.

=== Spin-offs ===

====&quot;Silent Hill: The Arcade&quot; (2007)====

&quot;Silent Hill: The Arcade&quot; is an arcade game that follows two characters, Eric and Tina, who have entered the town of Silent Hill and must battle monsters while uncovering the mystery behind Eric&#x27;s nightmares about a girl and a steamship. The game has a multiplayer element, where each player can choose to be either Eric or Tina. A second player can join the game at any time.

====&quot;Silent Hill: Orphan&quot; (2007)====

&quot;Silent Hill: Orphan&quot; is a mobile game set in an abandoned orphanage, featuring first-person, point-and-click gameplay.

====&quot;Silent Hill: The Escape&quot; (2007)====

&quot;Silent Hill: The Escape&quot; is a mobile game released in Japan for the FOMA phone on December 19, 2007, and internationally for iOS in 2009. The goal of the game is to guide the player through ten stages by finding a key and opening the locked door. It is played from a first-person perspective. The game received mixed reviews due to its lack of storyline and poor execution.

====&quot;Silent Hill: Orphan 2&quot; (2008)====
&quot;Silent Hill: Orphan 2&quot; is a mobile game and a sequel to &quot;Silent Hill: Orphan&quot;.

====&quot;Silent Hill: Orphan 3&quot; (2010)====

====&quot;Silent Hill: Book of Memories&quot; (2012)====

&quot;Silent Hill: Book of Memories&quot; was released for the PlayStation Vita. &quot;Book of Memories&quot; utilizes an overhead isometric view, follows a different storyline, and features returning creatures from the series&#x27; fictional universe, as well as cooperative gameplay. The game is the first installment in the series to feature multiplayer gameplay, apart from &quot;The Arcade&quot;. According to series producer Tomm Hulett, &quot;Book of Memories&quot;&#x27; gameplay is largely different from that of previous installments, focusing on cooperative multiplayer action rather than traditional psychological horror.

==== &quot;P.T.&quot; (2014) ====

During Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s presentation at Gamescom 2014, an interactive teaser titled &quot;P.T.&quot; (initialism for &quot;playable teaser&quot;) was released on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 4. The teaser revealed a new &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game entitled &quot;Silent Hills&quot;, being developed by Kojima Productions using the Fox Engine, in collaboration with Hideo Kojima and film director Guillermo del Toro, featuring actor Norman Reedus. On September 1, Sony revealed during its pre-TGS press conference that &quot;P.T.&quot; had been downloaded over a million times and viewed over 30 million times across platforms. &quot;P.T.&quot; was pulled from the PlayStation Store and is no longer available for download. Numerous remakes of &quot;P.T.&quot; have emerged due to the game&#x27;s extremely limited availability; it remains unavailable on the PlayStation Store and has since been blocked from running on the PlayStation 5.

==== &quot;Silent Hill: Ascension&quot; (2023) ====
An interactive media experience known as &quot;Silent Hill: Ascension&quot; was announced in October 2022. It was developed by Genvid Technologies, Bad Robot Games, and Behaviour Interactive. &quot;Silent Hill: Ascension&quot; is a Choose Your Own Adventure-style interactive game where viewers can vote on the direction of the story in real time, giving them agency in how the singular canon progresses, similar to other horror contemporaries such as &quot;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&quot; and the 2020 continuation of &quot;Ben Drowned&quot;. The first episode was broadcast on October 31, 2023, serving as the &quot;series premiere&quot; of the interactive series. The series was broadcast daily at 9:00 PM ET/6:00 PM PT for &quot;the next several months,&quot; with the last episode airing on April 24, 2024.

==== &quot;Silent Hill: The Short Message&quot; (2024) ====

Following messages from her friend Maya, Anita finds herself at a crumbling apartment block, infamous for rumors of suicides. Drawn inside, Anita soon finds her sense of reality shattered as she encounters bizarre, otherworldly spaces haunted by a twisted monster. Maya&#x27;s message was clear—&quot;can&#x27;t leave til you find it&quot;—but what is it that Anita is really looking for?

==== &quot;Silent Hill: Townfall&quot; (TBA) ====
A new game, &quot;Silent Hill: Townfall&quot;, was announced in October 2022 with a reveal trailer. It will be developed by No Code and published by Annapurna Interactive.

=== Cancelled projects ===

==== &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (Com.x graphic novel) ====
Initially planned for release in November 1999 by publisher Com.x, a 70-page original graphic novel adaptation of the original game (ISBN: 978-1903286005) was written by Jon Murphy and penciled by Neil Googe. Com.X founder Eddie Deighton explained in 2008:


Googe was assigned six months to finish the full-color art for the graphic novel. Although it was completed and an advertisement was featured in a European catalog, the adaptation was never released by Konami. He took an experimental approach to the comic layout, but due to his inexperience and lack of planning at the time, he felt that not everything he tried worked.

==== &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; (alternative versions) ====
The original plans for &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; were much different from what was eventually released. The story was initially intended to continue the &quot;inner fears&quot; concept used for James Sunderland, Angela Orosco, and Eddie Dombrowski in &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;. However, due to the slower-than-expected sales of &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;, Konami pushed Team Silent to turn the game into a more commercial arcade-style rail shooter spin-off (not to be confused with the later-released &quot;Silent Hill: The Arcade&quot;). This plan was rejected by the team, but the process wasted much of the budget and development time for &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot;. At the time, &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; was also criticized online for not focusing on Alessa Gillespie and for having a different art style, characters, and creatures compared to the first game. As a result, Team Silent decided not to move forward with their original plans for &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot;. Instead, they chose to conclude the Alessa storyline from the original &quot;Silent Hill&quot; and tie up loose ends to appease fans. Not every member of Team Silent agreed with this decision, though Akihiro Imamura noted that they also did not want to use a similar template for two games in a row.

====&quot;Room 302&quot;====

After &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; was released, Team Silent expressed interest in creating a sequel. In reality, &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; and &quot;Silent Hill 4: The Room&quot; were developed around the same time, &quot;almost simultaneously&quot;.Video Game News, Reviews, and Walkthroughs

Contrary to popular belief on the Internet, &quot;Silent Hill 4: The Room&quot; was always intended to be connected to the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series, at least as a &quot;spin-off.&quot; An interviewer once asked:

:&quot;Is it true that The Room was not originally going to be part of the Silent Hill series and that this was only changed part way through development?&quot;

In response, Masashi Tsuboyama and Akira Yamaoka stated:

It is false to say that the original concept, &quot;Room 302&quot;, was a completely separate horror game unrelated to &quot;Silent Hill&quot;. For example, the notion that halfway through development, &quot;Room 302&quot; was turned into &quot;Silent Hill 4&quot;, with developers merely sprinkling in some &quot;Silent Hill&quot; references late in the process, is incorrect. It is likely that before even 5-10% of the game&#x27;s development, it was decided and finalized that &quot;Room 302&quot; would be a proper &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game.

Some of the different gameplay mechanics and changes, such as using &quot;Room 302&quot; as a hub world, were intentional because the developers wanted to focus on &quot;change&quot; and &quot;new&quot; elements. There is no evidence that features like invincible ghosts, the absence of a flashlight, or not visiting the town of &quot;Silent Hill&quot; for much of the game were due to &quot;Room 302&quot; being a spin-off or the idea that &quot;&quot;Silent Hill 4&quot; was never meant to be a &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game.&quot; Similarly, the first half of &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; isn&#x27;t set in the town of &quot;Silent Hill&quot;.

As Masashi Tsuboyama explained:
Confusion likely arises from an interview that said &quot;*SH4 was not originally supposed to be a &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game.&quot;Interview with Akihiro Imamura and Akira Yamaoka (Game World) This probably refers to the very early stages of &quot;Room 302&quot;, when the developers were uncertain if they wanted &quot;Room 302&quot; to be an official &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game. It likely does not refer to when the actual development of the &quot;Silent Hill 4&quot; project seriously began.

==== &quot;Silent Hill 5&quot; ====
Before &quot;Silent Hill: Origins&quot; was made, Team Silent was tasked with working on a fifth installment in the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series, simply titled &quot;Silent Hill 5&quot;, with development starting as early as during &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot;. The game was delayed due to demand from fans who wanted proper closure for the first game. The planned story of &quot;Silent Hill 5&quot; was to focus on a damaged human being summoned to Silent Hill for a specific reason. Akira Yamaoka described the story as &quot;the darkest story we have come up with&quot;.

Another unique feature of the game was that it would start in Silent Hill as an everyday town with people going about their lives, which would slowly begin to rot away as players progressed through the game.

==== &quot;Broken Covenant&quot; ====
Before Climax Studios began working on what would later become &quot;Silent Hill: Origins&quot;, they originally pitched a different game idea to Konami in 2006. Intended to be a PlayStation 3 exclusive, the proposed game would have taken place in Arizona and starred a protagonist named Father Hector Santos. The priest would have utilized water, a major motif in the game, to perform &quot;holy rites and rituals.&quot; The proposal never received a green light from Konami, and it was reimagined as an original title called &quot;Broken Covenant&quot;, but that too was eventually shelved.

==== &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (remake) ====
The original plan for &quot;Silent Hill: Origins&quot; was to remake the original game for the PSP. However, after realizing how much work it would take to redo the graphics from the ground up, Climax Studios decided it would be better to create something new instead. In July 2019, Masahiro Ito of Team Silent was asked if he would be willing to work on a remake of the original game. He declined, stating, &quot;It will take about 3 years to build that. And you only live once. So repeating the same thing is just only a waste of time. Also, I get bored easily.&quot;

==== &quot;Silent Hill: Original Sin&quot; ====
When &quot;Silent Hill: Origins&quot; was being developed by the LA subsidiary of Climax Studios, it was originally conceived as a dark comedy inspired by the TV show &quot;Scrubs&quot;, using the RenderWare engine and an over-the-shoulder camera system. The game featured monsters such as the Straightjackets and Butcher, along with new creatures like the Miners, Afflicted, a wheelchair monster, Piercer, and Meat. Players could place barricades to protect themselves from threats. Instead of using a radio to alert the player of enemies, the initial version of the game employed a more visual cue: &quot;chilled breath.&quot; If many enemies were nearby, the edges of the screen would freeze over. Much of the map was altered in the final version of the game. Locations included a burned, debilitated hotel, the Doyle Asylum for the mentally ill (which once housed Dahlia Gillespie), the Orphium movie theatre, a meat packing plant, catacombs, and the Order&#x27;s lair. 

The opening scene was similar to the final game&#x27;s, except Travis Grady (modeled after Norman Reedus during development) pulls his truck over to stop Mister Twilight instead of Alessa. Mister Twilight flees at the sight of Alessa, who then transforms the town into its Fog World state. Travis loses consciousness and wakes up in a hospital room, trapped in the Otherworld. Alessa makes a deal with Travis: if he helps her obtain the Flauros, she will help him escape the town. Meanwhile, Michael Kaufmann, who works at the hospital, is studying a drug called White Claudia and believes it is linked to the strange events occurring in Silent Hill. Mister Twilight acts behind the scenes, manipulating events. Travis must navigate his way to the cult&#x27;s lair, survive traps and otherworldly threats, and separate the Real World from the Otherworld. His plan succeeds, but it unleashes Alessa&#x27;s nightmare upon the town. Mister Twilight is eventually revealed to be Michael Kaufmann. In a bad ending, Travis goes insane and becomes Pyramid Head.

Climax was not satisfied with the direction the game was going, citing mismanagement and fearing that it might be a disaster. The game was subsequently transferred and overhauled by Climax&#x27;s UK studio.

==== Nintendo DS titles ====
WayForward Technologies, developers of &quot;Silent Hill: Book of Memories&quot;, worked on a series installment for the Nintendo DS in 2006. They developed a one-room prototype demo using the lead character and assets from &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; before the game was canceled.

Renegade Kid pitched their DS title &quot;&quot; as a &quot;Silent Hill&quot; spin-off title. It was rejected by Konami for various reasons, including Konami not wanting to trust a small company with the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; license. Renegade Kid later pitched a modified version of &quot;Dementium II&quot;, which was also rejected, this time because Konami simply did not want to enter the DS space with a horror title at the time.

==== &quot;The Box&quot; ====
Silicon Knights announced the titles in production when the company ceased development in 2012. One of these games was called &quot;Silent Hill: The Box&quot; but later became known simply as &quot;The Box&quot;. This could have been the codename for the title after a publishing deal fell through, given the company&#x27;s financial status. Some early conceptual screenshots from the game can be seen on the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; Memories website.

==== &quot;Brahms PD&quot; ====
After creating &quot;Silent Hill: Origins&quot;, director Sam Barlow and his team at Climax Studios wanted to create a new &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game for the PSP. However, &quot;Silent Hill&quot;&#x27;s US producer suggested developing a first-person shooter for the Nintendo Wii set in the universe of the series. Climax began a project called &quot;Brahms PD&quot;, a spin-off to the main franchise, featuring an amnesiac police detective searching for his partner as the protagonist. In addition to the shooting gameplay, the game was to include transition sequences featuring sessions with a police psychiatrist, making it &quot;the world&#x27;s first truly interactive psychological horror.&quot; This project did not receive Konami&#x27;s approval and was ultimately abandoned.

==== &quot;Silent Hill: Cold Heart&quot; ====
&quot;Silent Hill: Cold Heart&quot; was the originally planned version of &quot;Silent Hill: Shattered Memories&quot;. The game would have followed a female protagonist named Jessica Chambers, who decides to take a trip to visit her parents. However, she becomes trapped in an enormous snowstorm. To save herself, she follows an ambulance in hopes of finding a safe place, which leads her to suddenly end up in Silent Hill. Unlike &quot;Shattered Memories&quot;, where running is the only way to avoid enemies, &quot;Cold Heart&quot; would have retained the use of melee combat from previous games. These combat moments were intended to take advantage of the Wii controller to create a real and intense experience using improvised weapons.

==== 2013 sequel ====
In 2013, Masahiro Ito was involved in developing a direct sequel to &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot;. Ito was displeased with how the character Pyramid Head was used in later installments of the series and wanted to reintroduce the antagonist Valtiel. An opening scene in the Otherworld was envisioned, involving a baby carriage in which Valtiel would slaughter Pyramid Head. The game was eventually canceled, but as late as 2017, Ito stated that if he ever makes a new game, he would carry out his plan to kill Pyramid Head or simply not use him.

====&quot;Silent Hills&quot;====

During Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s presentation at Gamescom 2014, an interactive teaser titled &quot;P.T.&quot; (initialism for &quot;playable teaser&quot;) was released on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 4. The teaser revealed a new &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game entitled &quot;Silent Hills&quot;, being developed by Kojima Productions using the Fox Engine, in collaboration with Hideo Kojima and film director Guillermo del Toro, featuring actor Norman Reedus.

During the 2015 San Francisco Film Festival on April 26, del Toro revealed that he would no longer be involved in the project with Kojima, presumably due to Kojima leaving Konami. Konami later released a statement confirming Reedus&#x27;s departure but clarified that the series would continue to be developed, with no mention of the current status of &quot;Silent Hills&quot;. Days later, Konami confirmed that &quot;Silent Hills&quot; was canceled but was open to future collaborations with Reedus and del Toro.

The cancellation of the game was met with significant backlash from fans, who later started a petition on Change.org asking for Konami to continue the project. The petition has received 194,651 signatures as of August 11, 2024.

==== &quot;Silent Hill&quot; anthology series (Supermassive Games) ====
Konami began soliciting pitches for new &quot;Silent Hill&quot; titles in 2018, including for an episodic series. Supermassive Games were among the developers to pitch a title, but Konami ultimately turned them down in favor of collaborating with Annapurna Interactive. Supermassive&#x27;s &quot;Silent Hill&quot; proposal was repurposed as the framework for their &quot;Dark Pictures Anthology&quot; series.

==== &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; (remake) (HexaDrive) ====
Despite interest in the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; franchise within Konami, it remained dormant for years due to internal disagreements on the direction it should take. Motoi Okamoto, who left Entersphere in 2018, subsequently joined Konami and became the series producer in 2019. The film &quot;Return to Silent Hill&quot;, developed by Christophe Gans, ultimately served as the catalyst for Konami&#x27;s decision to revitalize the brand.

During its absence, many independent and third-party horror games took inspiration from &quot;Silent Hill&quot;. Konami&#x27;s staff, including Okamoto, felt they needed to reaffirm the core identity of the series to stand apart from other titles. They concluded that what makes &quot;Silent Hill&quot; unique is its embodiment of &quot;true psychological horror,&quot; and chose to reboot &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; for that reason. Some staff members disagreed with this decision, lobbying instead to remake the first installment, which had previously been reimagined as &quot;Shattered Memories&quot; in 2009.

Konami originally reached out to HexaDrive about potentially porting the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series to current-gen consoles, specifically &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;, but HexaDrive opted to remake the game instead. Konami invited HexaDrive to a meeting around 2019, alongside several competing studios, asking them to create a pitch demo for a &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; remake. Ultimately, HexaDrive&#x27;s proposal was turned down in favor of collaborating with Bloober Team.

HexaDrive later shared additional development with Konami for a PS5-exclusive &quot;Silent Hill&quot; spin-off titled &quot;Silent Hill: The Short Message&quot;.

=== Future ===
In June 2022, in an interview with the French gaming website JeuxVideo.Com, Christophe Gans (director of the 2006 &quot;Silent Hill&quot; movie) confirmed that he had completed a script for a third &quot;Silent Hill&quot; film and was aiming for a 2023 release. He later reiterated this in an interview with JeuxActu, elaborating that the third film project would be part of a &quot;relaunch&quot; of the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; brand, accompanied by new video game.

In October, Gans spoke again about the upcoming relaunch and his third film, stating during an interview at the Strasbourg European Fantastic Film Festival, &quot;I know a bit about the [next Silent Hill game]. I work with Team Silent, the original creators. I work in collaboration with Konami,&quot; suggesting that members of the original development team, Team Silent, are involved with the upcoming game(s). On October 19, Konami released a video revealing a new film, &quot;Return to Silent Hill&quot;, and several new &quot;Silent Hill&quot; games: a &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; remake, &quot;Silent Hill: Townfall&quot;, and &quot;Silent Hill f&quot;. Both Akira Yamaoka and Masahiro Ito are confirmed to be returning for the &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; remake—Yamaoka as composer and Ito as the lead concept artist.

==Cast and characters==
==Recurring elements==

=== Plot traits and symbolism ===
The plots of the installments in the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series, except &quot;Shattered Memories&quot; and &quot;The Room&quot;, share a common setting: the foggy, rural American town of Silent Hill, which is a fictional location set in the northeastern United States. Some games specifically state the town as being located in Maine, whereas in the film, the town is set in West Virginia. The town in the first three games was inspired by the concept of a small town in America, as depicted by various media from different countries. While some of the development planning is more reminiscent of a Japanese village, indirect influence comes from two factual American towns in particular: Cushing, Maine and Snoqualmie, Washington. However, the town from the film series was inspired by Centralia, Pennsylvania. In &quot;Shattered Memories&quot;, Silent Hill is depicted as a heavily snow-covered town in the midst of a blizzard, while the events of &quot;The Room&quot; primarily occur in the fictional neighboring city of South Ashfield, with the player venturing to smaller locales around Silent Hill.

The series&#x27; player characters experience an occasional dark alteration of reality called the &quot;Otherworld.&quot; In this reality, physical laws often do not apply, with varying forms but most frequently ones whose physical appearance is based on that of Silent Hill. Characters in the series experience delusions and encounter tangible symbols of elements from their unconscious minds, mental states, and innermost thoughts when present in it, manifested into the real world. The origin of these manifestations is a malevolent power native to Silent Hill, which materializes human thoughts; this force was formerly non-evil but was corrupted by certain events that occurred in the area.

Some recurring monsters include the Nurses, who appear in almost every &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game, typically due to the sexual frustration or health conditions many of the protagonists experience during the course of the game&#x27;s events. Pyramid Head, another recurring monster who became the series mascot, has had his canon appearances contested. Robbie the Rabbit, an amusement park mascot, is another recurring figure. Additionally, a dog named Mira is featured in many joke endings. Another recurring plot trait in the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series is a fictional religious cult known only as The Order. Certain members of the organization act as antagonists in most of the series&#x27; installments (such as Dahlia in the first and prequel, Claudia in 3, Walter in &quot;The Room&quot;, and Judge Holloway in &quot;Homecoming&quot;). The Order operates the &quot;Wish House&quot; (also called &quot;Hope House&quot;), an orphanage for poor and homeless children, run by a charity organization called the &quot;Silent Hill Smile Support Society.&quot;

The religion followed by the Order is focused on the worship of a chief deity, named Samael in &quot;Origins&quot; but simply referred to as &quot;God&quot; in the previous games. The group&#x27;s dogma is derived from a myth: the deity set out to create paradise but ran out of power during the process; she will someday be resurrected, thus becoming able to finally create paradise and save mankind. The town&#x27;s cult repeatedly engages in illegal acts: ritual human sacrifices intended for the deity&#x27;s resurrection, illegal drug trade, and the kidnapping and confinement of children in a facility to teach them its dogma through brainwashing, while presenting the facility as an orphanage. The series also features various religious items with magical properties, which appear widely throughout the games.

Three thematic elements consistently drive the narratives of &quot;Silent Hill&quot; games: the theme of a main protagonist depicted as an &quot;everyman&quot; (with the exception of &quot;Homecoming&quot;, where the protagonist is thought to be a soldier and the game&#x27;s mechanics operate as such), and the everyman&#x27;s quest, either a search for a missing loved one or a scenario where the protagonist wanders into the town apparently by accident but is actually being &quot;summoned&quot; by a spiritual force in the town.

Multiple endings are a staple of the series, with all installments featuring some, the realization of which often depends on in-game actions performed by the player. In all but three of the series&#x27; games, one of these endings is a joke ending in which the main protagonist encounters unidentified flying objects: there is no joke ending in &quot;Silent Hill 4: The Room&quot;, and the only joke ending in &quot;Downpour&quot; is a surprise party for the player featuring characters from previous installments of the franchise, with a similar joke ending in &quot;Book of Memories&quot;.

The installments in the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series contain various forms of symbolism. The symbols are images, sounds, objects, creatures, or situations that represent concepts and facts, as well as the feelings, emotions, and mental states of the characters.

===Gameplay===

The installments in the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series primarily use a third-person view, with occasional fixed camera angles. Visibility is often low due to the alternating fog and darkness. All of the series&#x27; player characters, except Henry Townshend of &quot;Silent Hill 4: The Room&quot;, are equipped with a flashlight and a portable device that warns the player of nearby monsters by emitting static. This device varies across the games: a transistor radio in &quot;Origins&quot; and the first three installments, a walkie-talkie in &quot;Homecoming&quot; and &quot;Downpour&quot;, and a mobile phone in &quot;Shattered Memories.&quot;

The player characters in every &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game have access to a variety of melee weapons and firearms, with &quot;Origins&quot; and &quot;Downpour&quot; also featuring rudimentary hand-to-hand combat. &quot;Shattered Memories&quot; is the sole exception; it is designed without combat and focuses on evading creatures. Another key feature of the series&#x27; gameplay is puzzle-solving, which often results in the acquisition of an item essential to advancing in the games.

==Development==

=== Concept and influences ===
The development of the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series began in September 1996 with the creation of its first installment, &quot;Silent Hill&quot;. The game was created by Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company, Konami, aimed to produce a game that would be successful in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, the developers of &quot;Silent Hill&quot; had significant artistic freedom because the game was still produced in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami&#x27;s initial plan and to make &quot;Silent Hill&quot; a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead.

The scenario for the first installment was created by director Keiichiro Toyama. The story of the second installment, &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;, was conceived by CGI director Takayoshi Sato, who based it on the novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, with individual members of the team collaborating on the game&#x27;s actual scenario. The main writing was done by Hiroyuki Owaku and Sato.

The first game, &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, utilizes real-time 3D environments. To mitigate the limitations of the hardware, developers extensively used fog and darkness to obscure the graphics.

Sato estimated the budget of the first installment at $3–5 million and &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;&#x27;s at $7–10 million. He said that the development team intended to make &quot;Silent Hill&quot; a masterpiece rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, opting for an engaging story that would persist over time—similar to successful literature.

The games are known to have drawn influence from media such as &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, &quot;Phantoms&quot;, &quot;Session 9&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Mist&quot;, and the art of Francis Bacon, largely through cultivating a technique of inducing fear through more psychological levels of perception. Many sequences and tropes from these films share identical concepts. The films and television series of American filmmaker David Lynch are also acknowledged to have influenced Team Silent during the production of the initial games, especially &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;.

Another major influence is Japanese horror, with comparisons made to classical Japanese Noh theatre and early 20th-century fiction writers, such as Edogawa Rampo. The town of Silent Hill is a small rural American town imagined by the creative team. It was based on Western literature and films, as well as on depictions of American towns in European and Russian culture. The version of the town from the film adaptations of the first and third games is loosely based on the central Pennsylvania town of Centralia.

The Order&#x27;s religion is based on various characteristics of different religions, such as the origins of Christianity, Aztec rituals, Shinto shrines, as well as Japanese folklore. The names of gods in the organization&#x27;s religion were conceived by Hiroyuki Owaku, but they have Aztec and Mayan motifs, as Owaku used pronunciations from these civilizations as a reference. Certain religious items appearing in the series were conceived by the team, and for others, various religions were used as a basis. The evil spirit-dispelling substance Aglaophotis, which appears in the first installment and &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot;, is based on a herb of similar name and nature in the Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism). The name of the talisman called the &quot;Seal of Metatron&quot; references the angel Metatron.

===Audio===

The installments in the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series feature various sound effects, some of which are ambient, as well as periods of silence. These sound effects are designed to induce certain emotions and feelings in the player, such as urgency, discomfort, or a sense of psychological disturbance. According to the series&#x27; former sound director, Akira Yamaoka, atmosphere is a crucial element of the series, and without it, the series&#x27; production would have been impossible. The games also feature soundtracks scored by Yamaoka.

The musical pieces range in genre from industrial to trip hop to rock, with some tracks featuring vocals by voice actress Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. The music of &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; and &quot;Silent Hill 4&quot; also includes performance and songwriting contributions from musician and voice actor Joe Romersa. &quot;Downpour&quot; and &quot;Book of Memories&quot; feature soundtracks scored by composer Daniel Licht; &quot;Downpour&quot; includes music in the industrial genre, with vocals by McGlynn as well as by Jonathan Davis of the band Korn.

==Reception and legacy==
The &quot;Silent Hill&quot; franchise has been praised for its graphics, atmosphere, and narrative. While the first three installments received critical acclaim, and the fourth game received general praise from critics, later games in the series were less well-received.

The first installment in the series, &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, received a positive response from critics upon its release and was commercially successful. It is considered a defining title in the survival horror genre, moving away from B movie horror elements toward a psychological style of horror that emphasizes atmosphere.

&quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; received critical acclaim. It was named the fourteenth-best game on the PS2 by IGN, which noted that &quot;it preserved most of the original game&#x27;s what-might-be-out-there fear, but with major advances to the graphics and sound, the game was able to deliver a far more immersive, frightful, and compelling storyline&quot;. &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; is considered one of the best horror games of all time by many, as it features on several &quot;best games ever&quot; lists by critics.

Praise for &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; was particularly aimed at its dark, cerebral narrative and storytelling, its exploration and handling of mature themes and concepts such as mental illness and domestic abuse, its sound design and musical composition, and its atmospheric and frightening tone and direction. Additionally, the fear-inducing and tense gameplay, along with the graphics and the symbolic nature of the monster designs, contributed to its acclaim. &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; is widely considered to be the best installment in the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series and is regarded by many as a masterpiece of the horror game genre.

&quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; was well received by critics, especially for its presentation, including its environments, graphics, and audio, as well as the overall horror elements and themes continued from past installments. The game received praise for its story, which was a continuation of the first game&#x27;s narrative.

In comparison to the previous three installments, &quot;Silent Hill 4: The Room&quot; received mostly positive reviews, though its reception was lower than that of its predecessors. Many reviewers disliked the increased emphasis on combat, which lessened the focus on the horror aspect of gameplay. However, the game was praised for its atmospheric tone and direction, sound design, graphics, and storyline. The changes from the series&#x27; conventions received mixed responses, varying from positive to negative. 1UP.com stated that Konami went &quot;backwards&quot; with this game, though reviewers such as GameSpot still praised the game&#x27;s atmosphere.

&quot;Origins&quot; received positive reviews despite some criticism. It was praised for returning to the old gameplay formula—according to IGN, &quot;Origins&quot; does justice to the series as a whole. However, some critics pointed out the series&#x27; increasing predictability, with GameSpot stating that &quot;this old fog needs to learn some new tricks&quot;.

&quot;Homecoming&quot; received mixed reviews. It was praised for its graphics and audio, but the horror and gameplay received mixed reactions. Some critics, such as GameSpot, felt that it lost &quot;the psychological horror factor that the series is so well-known for&quot;. Some critics were harsher; IGN called the game a &quot;letdown&quot;.

&quot;Shattered Memories&quot; received more positive reviews. GameSpot praised the game&#x27;s effort at reinventing the first game&#x27;s plot, rather than being a simple remake.

&quot;Downpour&quot; received mixed reviews. While certain critics praised the soundtrack and story elements, the game was criticized for &quot;sluggish combat&quot; and &quot;occasional freezes&quot;.

&quot;HD Collection&quot; also received mixed reviews. Critics criticized the collection for many technical issues plaguing both games and the artistic changes made to the games. &quot;Book of Memories&quot;, while receiving mixed reviews, has been the least well-received game in the series, with most criticism regarding the game&#x27;s shift in genre.

The Duffer Brothers have cited &quot;Silent Hill&quot; as an influence on their 2016 television show &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. They noted that it inspired the Upside Down, a parallel dimension in the series.

==Other media==

Print media of the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; franchise includes a series of comic book adaptations; the novels &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;, and &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; by Sadamu Yamashita, which are novelizations of their eponymous video games; the guidebook &quot;Lost Memories&quot;; and the art book &quot;Drawing Block: Silent Hill 3 Program&quot;.

Spin-off video games based on the series include the arcade game &quot;Silent Hill: The Arcade&quot; and the mobile games &quot;Silent Hill: Orphan&quot; and &quot;Silent Hill: The Escape&quot;.

Konami has announced &quot;Silent Hill&quot;-themed pachinko machines, one in 2015 and another two titled &quot;Silent Hill: Return&quot; and &quot;Silent Hill: Escape&quot; in 2020.

Downloadable content for the video games &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot; and &quot;Dark Deception: Monsters &amp; Mortals&quot; was released in June 2020 and March 2021, respectively.

===Film series===

A film adaptation of the first game in the series, &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, was released in 2006. It was adapted and directed by French film director, producer, and writer Christophe Gans, who is a big fan of the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game series.

A second film, titled &quot;Silent Hill: Revelation&quot;, written and directed by M. J. Bassett and based on &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot;, was released in 2012.

In a 2020 interview, Gans expressed interest in making a third film, stating that a script was being developed centered on puritanism. In October 2022, a sequel to the first film was announced to be in early development, referred to as &quot;Return to Silent Hill&quot;, with Gans returning to direct. This film will be based on &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* The Axis of Perdition, an industrial black metal band, recorded &quot;Physical Illucinations in the Sewer of Xuchilbara (The Red God)&quot;, a 2004 EP named after a god from the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; franchise. The EP also states that it was recorded &quot;in the confines of Toluca Prison,&quot; a location from &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;. The track titles and tracks themselves refer to &quot;Silent Hill&quot; and feature music and voice samples, most notably of Claudia Wolf, the main antagonist of &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot;.
* &quot;&quot;, a survival horror game for the Nintendo DS, was originally pitched as a &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game, but it was turned down by Konami. &quot;Dementium II&quot;, also a survival horror game for the Nintendo DS, was similarly pitched as a &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game but was rejected by Konami.
* The &quot;Upside Down&quot;, a location in the Netflix 2016 horror TV series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, is inspired by the series&#x27; namesake foggy town of &quot;Silent Hill&quot;.

<text>A bakery is an establishment that produces and sells flour-based baked goods made in an oven such as bread, cookies, cakes, doughnuts, bagels, pastries, and pies. Some retail bakeries are also categorized as cafés, serving coffee and tea to customers who wish to consume the baked goods on the premises. In some countries, a distinction is made between bakeries, which primarily sell breads, and pâtisseries, which primarily sell sweet baked goods.

==History==

Baked goods have been around for thousands of years. The art of baking was very popular during the Roman Empire. It was highly famous art as Roman citizens loved baked goods and demanded them frequently for important occasions such as feasts and weddings. Because of the fame of the art of baking, around 300 BC, baking was introduced as an occupation and respectable profession for Romans. Bakers began to prepare bread at home in an oven, using grist mills to grind grain into flour for their breads. The demand for baked goods persisted, and the first bakers&#x27; guild was established in 168 BC in Rome. The desire for baked goods promoted baking throughout Europe and expanded into eastern parts of Asia. Bakers started baking bread and other goods at home and selling them on the streets.

This trend became common, and soon, baked products were sold in streets of Rome, Germany, London, and more. A system of delivering baked goods to households arose as the demand increased significantly. This prompted bakers to establish places where people could purchase baked goods. The first open-air market for baked goods was established in Paris, and since then bakeries have become a common place to purchase delicious goods and to socialize. On July 7, 1928, a bakery in Chillicothe, Missouri introduced sliced bread using the automatic bread-slicing machine, invented by Otto Frederick Rohwedder. While the bread initially failed to sell, due to its &quot;sloppy&quot; aesthetic, and the fact it went stale faster, it later became popular. In World War II bread slicing machines were effectively banned, as the metal in them was required for wartime use. When they were requisitioned, creating 100 tons of metal alloy, the decision proved very unpopular with housewives.

World War II directly affected the bread industry in the UK. Baking schools closed during this time, so when the war ended there was a lack of skilled bakers. This resulted in new methods being developed to satisfy the world&#x27;s desire for bread, including chemical additives, premixes and specialised machinery. Old methods of baking were almost completely eradicated when these new methods were introduced and the industry became industrialised. The old methods were seen as unnecessary and financially unsound. During this period there were not many traditional bakeries left.

== Specialities ==


Some bakeries provide services for special occasions (such as weddings, anniversaries, birthday parties, business networking events, etc.) or customized baked products for people who have allergies or sensitivities to certain foods (such as nuts, peanuts, dairy or gluten, etc.). Bakeries can provide a wide range of cake designs such as sheet cakes, layer cakes, wedding cakes, tiered cakes, etc. Other bakeries may specialize in traditional or hand-made types of baked products made with locally milled flour, without flour bleaching agents or flour treatment agents, baking what is sometimes referred to as artisan bread.

==Commercialization==
In many countries, many grocery stores and supermarkets sell &quot;sliced bread&quot; (prepackaged/presliced bread), cakes, and other pastries. They may also offer in-store baking, with products either fully baked on site or part-baked prior to delivery to store, and some offer cake decoration. Nonetheless, many people still prefer to get their baked goods from a small artisanal bakery, either out of tradition, the availability of a greater variety of baked products, or due to the higher quality products characteristic of the trade of baking.

<doc id="390679" wikidata="Q2320292" url="?curid=390679" title="Avalanche (character)">
<text>Avalanche is the name of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Each character is usually depicted as an enemy of the X-Men.

The Dominikos Petrakis version of Avalanche is a Cretan mutant who possesses the ability to generate seismic waves from his hands that are strong enough to create earthquakes of varying sizes and to disintegrate any substance other than living tissue. He has been a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants and Freedom Force.

The animated series &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; portrays a different version of Avalanche named Lance Alvers, a misguided mutant teenager and romantic love interest of the X-Men&#x27;s Shadowcat.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne, the Dominikos Petrakis version of Avalanche first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #141 (Jan. 1981).

==Fictional character biography==
===Dominikos Petrakis===
Avalanche&#x27;s story before Mystique recruits him for the second Brotherhood of Evil Mutants is largely a mystery. It is known, however, that he is an immigrant from the Greek island of Crete. There, he lives a quiet life until Mystique invites him to join her new Brotherhood. During his first public appearance with the Brotherhood, the team unsuccessfully attempts to assassinate Senator Robert Kelly during his hearings and testimony on his belief that mutants pose a mortal threat to humanity. The X-Men arrive to stop the assassination and battle the new Brotherhood. After escaping the fray, Avalanche continues his support of Mutant supremacy via terrorist and criminal activities and battling the Avengers with the Brotherhood.

Avalanche briefly leaves the Brotherhood and attempts to blackmail the state of California into paying him an enormous sum to prevent him from using his power to generate an earthquake. Avalanche fights the Hulk alongside Landslide on this occasion and suffers broken arms when he attempts to use his powers against the Hulk. When he returns to the Brotherhood, together they encounter Rom and Hybrid. The team later battles the X-Men as the &quot;Brotherhood of Evil Mutants&quot; one final time.

After that, The Brotherhood&#x27;s leader Mystique offers the group&#x27;s services to the United States government. Their first mission under their new name of Freedom Force is to capture the mutant Magneto on behalf of the federal government. The government then sends Freedom Force to capture the Avengers. While seeking to arrest Rusty Collins, he clashed with X-Factor. Freedom Force then fights the X-Men in Dallas and is present at the X-Men&#x27;s apparent demise, and battles the New Mutants in Dallas as well. Freedom Force then battled Cyclops and Marvel Girl. Freedom Force again tries to arrest Rusty Collins and battled the New Mutants, but are able to arrest Rusty and Skids as well. They are also dispatched to rescue Senator Robert Kelly from a South American drug syndicate that had kidnapped him, battling the syndicate&#x27;s superhuman agents in the process. Freedom Force also has a costly battle with the Reavers on Muir Island where a number of members are killed or seriously injured. During the Acts of Vengeance, Avalanche teams with Blob and Pyro against the Avengers. Avalanche then joins Freedom Force&#x27;s effort to stop a prison breakout at the Vault. Avalanche then participates in Freedom Force&#x27;s final mission in Kuwait. He abandons Blob and Pyro during the battle with Desert Sword to save the seriously injured Crimson Commando.

When Freedom Force is disbanded after the botched mission in the Gulf War, Avalanche continues to work for the government as part of Project: Wideawake, but soon leaves when he finds out that his friend Pyro had contracted the Legacy Virus.

By the time the X-Men establish themselves in San Francisco, Avalanche, going by the alias &quot;Nick&quot;, establishes a bar in order to make a living away from crime. When the X-Men moved their headquarters to San Francisco, Petros was frightened that they would eventually come for him for his past crimes. As he was packing in hopes of leaving his new-found life, the X-Men popped in with a friendly warning that they have a truce but will be back if he ever decides to return to a life of crime. As they leave, with his place of business and apartment trashed, Petros looks around, mumbling to himself.

When Norman Osborn starts his war against Mutants in the heart of San Francisco, Gambit sees Avalanche during the riots with Erg and when Ares makes himself known, Avalanche attacks him by causing the earth to rise up under him. Ares then knocks him out by choking him. He is seen one more time, sitting drunk in his own bar together with other mutants. They are angry that humans are trying to prevent new mutant births and Avalanche participates in the riot. He has the unfortunate circumstance of being paired up against Daken, who easily dodges the worried Avalanche&#x27;s tremor and was about to slice him. He is taken into custody along with several other mutants who participated in the riots. Eventually Avalanche and the other imprisoned mutants are freed by the X-Force and he becomes a resident of Utopia.

While Utopia and all of San Francisco are trapped in an energy dome created by Bastion, and the mutant race face extermination at the hands of Nimrod Sentinels from the future, Avalanche is among many of Utopia&#x27;s non-X-Men residents who have now taken up fighting alongside their former rivals. He can be seen fighting alongside the X-Men Sunspot, Husk, and Boom-Boom, defending the passage of the Bart Tunnels. As an &quot;X-Man&quot;, Avalanche is also called in by Cyclops during the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline to help them stop Kurrth. Avalanche uses his powers to create a chasm that Kurrth would not cross, but Kurrth creates a psychic bridge for him and his brainwashed followers to cross anyway.

Avalanche is kidnapped by the Red Skull who removed part of his brain, replacing it with a machine that turned Avalanche into a puppet to attack New York City. As Captain America tries to stop him, he claimed that &quot;the inciting act is complete&quot; and jumped to his apparent death.

Avalanche was among the mutants resurrected and residing on Krakoa.

===Unknown===
A somehow-repowered Mesmero brainwashed the unknown Avalanche into joining his Brotherhood of Mutants which was secretly funded by anti-mutant activist Lydia Nance. Avalanche&#x27;s first mission with the Brotherhood of Mutants was to kidnap Mayor Bill de Blaso and held him hostage. The X-Men arrived and defeated the Brotherhood of Mutants who are then arrested by the arriving S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents.

As Lydia Nance still had a use for the Brotherhood of Mutants, she orchestrated Mesmero&#x27;s escape from the Box. Mesmero once again lured Avalanche and the second Pyro into helping him out again. They were to attack a yacht that was owned by the Heritage Initiative at the time of its fundraiser. They group fought the X-Men alongside the NYPD. The Brotherhood of Mutants managed to get away and fall back to their base. When Mesmero states that the Brotherhood of Mutants are still under Lydia Nance&#x27;s paycheck, Pyro takes his leave since he didn&#x27;t want to work for an anti-mutant activist. Avalanche then demanded from Mesmero to get Pyro&#x27;s cut.

Avalanche then joined another new Brotherhood of Mutants, this time led by Magneto&#x27;s clone Joseph. During a battle with the X-Men, Avalanche mocked Magik, prompting her to stab him in the heart with her soulsword. It is unknown if he survived this encounter.

==Powers and abilities==
The Dominikos Petrakis version of Avalanche is a mutant with the superhuman ability to generate powerful seismic waves from his hands, creating highly destructive effects. The waves can cause an inorganic object to shatter or crumble into dust and has in recent years been shown to affect organic matter as well. When directed against large objects like buildings or upon the earth itself, the seismic waves can produce effects similar to those of an earthquake or avalanche within limited areas. Avalanche need not touch an object to affect it; he can direct the waves against it from some distance away. Avalanche himself is immune to the generation of his own vibratory waves. However, if the seismic waves were reflected back at him, he would be injured. Avalanche&#x27;s power originally had little or no effect on organic tissue, with the reflected vibrations from organic matter (&quot;feedback&quot;) injuring him, as when he once tried to attack the Hulk, but lately this has appeared to no longer be the case. As yet there is no known limit to the amount of area upon which Avalanche can use his powers at one time. There is no evidence yet, however, that he could create an earthquake capable of destroying an entire city. Avalanche is a fair hand-to-hand combatant and received unarmed combat training while a member of Freedom Force. Avalanche wears an armored battle suit that gives him enhanced resistance to injury, up to and including protecting him from a land mine. While a member of Freedom Force, he used a two-way radio device for communication with other Freedom Force members.

The unidentified version of Avalanche is also a mutant with the same abilities as the first version except that he can also target organic tissue which the first version was unable to do.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse, Avalanche was one of the select mutants that were approached by Sinister and offered a chance to join his Elite Mutant Force. Avalanche, however, refused Sinister&#x27;s offer, for which he was captured at the Breeding Pens. During an escape attempt, Avalanche was killed and his corpse turned over to the Dark Beast for experimentation.

===Marvel Zombies===
In &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;, he is seen as a zombie alongside a zombie version of the Freedom Force fighting the suddenly zombified X-Men.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, Dominic appears as a member of the NYPD strikeforce known as the Brotherhood.

===Old Man Logan===
In the original &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; arc on Earth-807128, it was mentioned that Avalanche was the one who blinded Hawkeye during his discussion with Logan. This was seen in the pages of &quot;Old Man Hawkeye&quot; where he vibrated Hawkeye&#x27;s skull after he killed Baron Zemo.

In the pages of &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; that took place on Earth-21923, Avalanche was among the villains that attacked the Avengers in Connecticut. After Giant-Man killed Crossbones and Vulture, Avalanche used his powers to open up a hole in the ground and Moloids started crawling over Giant-Man enough for him to fall to the ground.

<text>Catherine Labouré, DC (May 2, 1806 – December 31, 1876) was a French member of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and a Marian visionary. She is believed to have relayed the request from the Blessed Virgin Mary to create the Miraculous Medal, now worn by millions of people around the world. Labouré spent forty years caring for the aged and infirm. For this, she is called the patroness of seniors.

== Early life ==
Catherine Labouré was born on 2 May 1806, in the Burgundy region of France to Madeleine Louise Gontard and Pierre Labouré, a farmer. She was the 9th of 11 living children. Her baptismal name was Zoe, but her family rarely used that name. Labouré&#x27;s mother died on 9 October 1815, when Labouré was nine years old.

She and her sister Marie Antoinette moved to their aunt&#x27;s house at Saint-Rémy, a village from their home. It is there that Catherine had a dream of a priest, whom she later recognised as Vincent de Paul. The priest said to her: &#x27;My daughter, it is good to care for the sick. For now, you flee from me, but one day you will be glad to approach me. God has plans for you. Don&#x27;t forget it!&#x27;.

At the age of 12, Catherine returned to her father&#x27;s farm to help care for her family. Later, her father, wishing to deter her from her religious vocation, sent her to Paris to work in his brothers’ eating establishment for poor workers. There she observed their suffering and continued to desire a life as a nurse with the Daughters of Charity.

Labouré began her novitiate on April 21, 1830 at the convent on the Rue du Bac in Paris and on, January 30, 1831, she took her vows. It is at this convent that she had the visions of the Virgin Mary that led to the creation of the Miraculous Medal.

==Visions==

===Vincent de Paul===
In April 1830, the remains of Vincent de Paul were translated to the Vincentian church in Paris. The solemnities included a novena. On three successive evenings, upon returning from the church to the Rue du Bac, Catherine reportedly experienced, in the convent chapel, a vision of what she took to be the heart of St. Vincent above a shrine containing a relic from his right arm. Each time the heart appeared a different color: white, red, and black. She interpreted this to mean that the Vincentian communities would prosper, and that there would be a change of government. The convent chaplain advised her to forget the matter.

===Blessed Virgin Mary===
Labouré stated that on July 19, 1830, the eve of the feast of St. Vincent de Paul, she woke up after hearing the voice of a child calling her to the chapel, where she heard the Virgin Mary say to her, &quot;God wishes to charge you with a mission. You will be contradicted, but do not fear; you will have the grace to do what is necessary. Tell your spiritual director all that passes within you. Times are evil in France and in the world&quot;.

On November 27, 1830, Labouré reported that Mary returned to her during evening meditations. She displayed herself inside an oval frame, standing upon a globe; rays of light came out of her hands in the direction of a globe. Around the margin of the frame appeared the words &quot;O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee.&quot; As Labouré watched, the frame seemed to rotate, showing a circle of twelve stars, a large letter &quot;M&quot; surmounted by a cross, and the stylized Sacred Heart of Jesus and Immaculate Heart of Mary underneath. Asked why some of the rays of light did not reach the earth, Mary reportedly replied, &quot;Those are the graces for which people forget to ask.&quot; Mary then asked her to take these images to her father confessor, telling him that they should be put on medallions. &quot;All who wear them will receive great graces.&quot;

Labouré did so, and after two years of investigation and observation of her normal daily behavior, the priest took the information to his archbishop without revealing her identity. The request was approved and the design of the medallions was commissioned through French goldsmith Adrien Vachette. They proved to be exceedingly popular—the Miraculous Medal was quickly adopted by millions of the Catholic faithful. It also played an important role in the proclamation by Pope Pius IX of the Immaculate Conception on December 8, 1854. The dogma of the Immaculate Conception had not yet been officially promulgated, but the medal, with its &quot;conceived without sin&quot; slogan, was influential in popular approval of the idea.

==Later life and service to the poor and elderly==
Immediately after taking her vows, Labouré was sent to the Hospice d&#x27;Enghien, located in the village of Reuilly, which, at the time, was slightly outside the city limits of Paris. She spent the next forty years there, caring for the elderly and infirm. For this, she is called the patroness of seniors.

During this time, she not only cared for the sick, but also worked on the hospice&#x27;s farm, looked after the poultry and cleaned the stables. Her life was notable for her devotion to the poor and elderly and for her humility and profound silence.

==Death and legacy==
Labouré died in the Hospice on December 31, 1876, at the age of 70. Her body was later moved and is now encased in glass beneath the side altar in the Chapel of Our Lady of Graces of the Miraculous Medal in 140 Rue du Bac, Paris.

Her cause for sainthood was declared upon discovery that her body was incorrupt. She was beatified on May 28, 1933, by Pope Pius XI and canonized on July 27, 1947, by Pope Pius XII.

Labouré&#x27;s feast day is observed on November 28 according to the liturgical calendar of the Congregation of the Mission, the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris. She is listed in the &quot;Martyrologium Romanum&quot; for December 31.

<text>Born in Flames is a 1983 American utopian/dystopian docufiction drama film directed, produced and co-written by radical intersectional feminist Lizzie Borden. The film explores racism, classism, sexism and heterosexism in an alternate socialist democratic United States. The title comes from the Red Krayola song &quot;Born in Flames&quot;, which appears in the film and was written by Mayo Thompson, a member of the conceptual artists&#x27; group Art &amp; Language.

==Plot==

The film is set during the 10th anniversary of a peaceful socialist-democratic revolution, and follows two feminist groups in New York City, each voicing their concerns to the public by pirate radio. One group, led by an outspoken white lesbian, Isabel, operates Radio Ragazza. The other, led by a soft-spoken African-American, Honey, operates Phoenix Radio. The local community is stimulated into action after a world-traveling political activist, Adelaide Norris, is arrested upon arriving at a New York City airport, and suspiciously dies while in police custody. Simultaneously, a Women&#x27;s Army led by Hilary Hurst and advised by Zella, an elderly theorist and mentor, is taking direct action in the city. Initially, both Honey and Isabel refuse to join. This group, along with Norris and the radio stations, are under investigation by FBI agents. Their progress is tracked by three editors for a socialist newspaper, whose persistent and opinionated journalism ultimately gets them fired.

The story involves several different women with different perspectives and attempts to show several examples of how sexism plays out on the streets and how it can be combatted. In one scene, two men attack a woman on the sidewalk, forcing her to the ground. Before they can cause further harm, dozens of women on bicycles and blowing whistles come to chase the men away and help the woman. The movie shows women – despite their various differences – organizing in meetings, making radio shows, creating art, wheatpasting, working various jobs, etc. The film portrays a world rife with violence against women, high female unemployment, and government oppression. The women in the film start to come together to make a bigger impact, by means that some in their society consider terrorism.

Ultimately, after both radio stations are suspiciously burned down, Honey and Isabel team up and broadcast Phoenix Ragazza Radio from stolen U-Haul vans. They also join the Women&#x27;s Army, which sends a group of terrorists to interrupt a broadcast of the President of the United States, who is proposing that women be paid to do housework. The film ends with the women taking one more action, to bomb the antenna on top of the World Trade Center to hinder further destructive messages coming from the government and mainstream media.

==Reception and legacy==
Rotten Tomatoes reports an 88% approval rating for the film based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10.

&quot;Variety&quot; said at the time of the film&#x27;s release that it has &quot;all the advantages and the disadvantages of a home movie&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2021 described the film as a zero-budget underground film with all the hallmarks of guerilla filmmaking, writing that &quot;Borden is filming on the real New York streets, also using real news footage of real demos and real police violence&quot; and that the &quot;anarchic spirit of agitprop pulses from this scrappy, smart, subversive film.&quot; (In an interview, Borden herself said, &quot;I could only shoot once a month, when I had $200 ... I would gather everyone in this old Lincoln Continental I kept parked in front of my loft, go somewhere and shoot, and then I&#x27;d spend the interim just editing.&quot;)

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1983: &quot;Only those who already share Miss Borden&#x27;s ideas are apt to find her film persuasive.&quot; Marjorie Baumgarten&#x27;s 2001 review for &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; praised the film, saying: &quot;Beautifully made, courageously edited, and swift-moving, this challenging, provocative film is a work that is both humanist and revolutionary.&quot; Frances Dickinson of &quot;Time Out London&quot; wrote that Borden &quot;[handles] her story with audacity and make[s] even the driest argument crackle with humour, while the more poignant moments burn with a fierce white heat.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; rated it 2/4 stars, saying: &quot;This feminist film wins laurels for close attention to detail in a radical filmmaking effort.&quot; Greg Baise of the &quot;Metro Times&quot; called it &quot;an early &#x27;80s landmark of indie and queer cinema&quot;. In 2022, the film was ranked joint 243rd in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Greatest Films of All Time poll, tied for that ranking with 21 other films, including &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Possession.&quot;

===References===
* The movie refers to many feminist movements and tools, including black feminism, white feminism, consciousness raising, independent radio, and responses to police brutality.
* There is also a reference to wages for housework, a &#x27;70s feminist social movement addressing women&#x27;s reproductive labor, in a scene in which the President announces on television: “For the first time in our history we’ll provide women with wages for housework,” just before a group of women hijack the broadcast to air a militant message. This moment in the film highlights political antagonisms between white heteronormative feminism and anti-racist / anti-capitalist feminism.
* The movie also refers to U.S. policies like the Workfare program and the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1976, which in the film are taken to discriminate against single and queer women (in one scene, a TV news journalist announces that &quot;male heads of families&quot; would get jobs).
* In his 2013 critical analysis, media historian Lucas Hilderbrand notes the film&#x27;s parallels with the Combahee River Collective&#x27;s &quot;A Black Feminist Statement&quot; (1977) [see &#x27;Influence&#x27; below].

===Production notes===
*The film features a live performance of &quot;Undercover Nation&quot; by The Bloods, the group led by lead actor Adele Bertei; and the 1980 Red Krayola song &quot;Born In Flames&quot; (originally released as a single, it was credited then, as here, to &quot;The Red Crayola&quot;). Other music used includes &quot;I’ll Take You There&quot; by African-American gospel/R&amp;B/soul group The Staple Singers, &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; by Billie Holiday, &quot;Voodoo Chile&quot; by Jimi Hendrix and &quot;New Town&quot; by British female punk group The Slits.
* The cast of the film includes civil rights lawyer and activist Florynce Kennedy; punk singer and no wave artist Adele Bertei (from The Bloods and The Contortions); film director Kathryn Bigelow, and actors Ron Vawter and Eric Bogosian.
* Cinematography and camera work involved several people over the long course of shooting the film; these included Borden herself and some of her cast and crew members; as well as documentary filmmaker Chris Hegedus and no wave filmmaker Michael Oblowitz.

===Influence===
The film is discussed in Christina Lane&#x27;s book &quot;Feminist Hollywood: From &quot;Born in Flames&quot; to &quot;Point Break&quot;&quot;.

A “graphic translation” of the movie made by artist Kaisa Lassinaro, which contains an interview of Lizzie Borden, was published by Occasional Papers in 2011. The book is a collage composition made of screencaps with a selection of dialogues from the movie.

In 2013, a dossier on the film was published as a special issue of &quot;Women &amp; Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory&quot;. With an introduction from Craig Willse and Dean Spade, the dossier includes a number of essays that address race, queerness, intersectionality, radicalism, violence, and feminism in the film.

The film has experienced something of a renaissance after the 35mm restoration print premiered in 2016 at the Anthology Film Archives. followed by promotion by the Criterion Channel and a re-release that took Borden to screenings around the world. Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote &quot;the free, ardent, spontaneous creativity of &quot;Born in Flames&quot; emerges as an indispensable mode of radical change—one that many contemporary filmmakers with political intentions have yet to assimilate.&quot; He also wrote &quot;Borden&#x27;s exhilarating collage-like story stages news reports, documentary sequences, and surveillance footage alongside tough action scenes and musical numbers; her violent vision is both ideologically complex and chilling.&quot; Melissa Anderson of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote &quot;this unruly, unclassifiable film — perhaps the sole entry in the hybrid genre of radical-lesbian-feminist sci-fi vérité — premiered two years into the Reagan regime, but its fury proves as bracing today as it was back when this country began its inexorable shift to the right.&quot; Borden was invited to show the new 35mm print in Brussels, Barcelona, Madrid, San Sebastián, Milan, Toronto, the Edinburgh Film Festival, London Film Festival, along with screenings in Detroit, Rochester, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.

<doc id="390694" wikidata="Q122584" url="?curid=390694" title="Shadwell">
<text>Shadwell is an area in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in East London, England. It also forms part of the city&#x27;s East End. Shadwell is on the north bank of the River Thames between Wapping (to the west) and Ratcliff and Limehouse (to the east) and is east of Charing Cross. This riverside location has meant the area&#x27;s history and character have been shaped by the maritime trades.

Historically a hamlet of the Manor and Ancient Parish of Stepney, it became a parish in its own right in 1670. the area of the Hamlet and Parish included areas south of Cable Street including Shadwell Basin and the King Edward Memorial Park.

==History==
===Etymology===
In the 13th century, the area was a low lying marsh known as &quot;Scadflet&quot;, from the Anglo-Saxon , meaning a shallow creek or bay. Because a spring by a church dedicated to St Chad filled a nearby well, a false etymology changed the name into Chadwelle. This changed further into Shadwell.

===Roman period===
In 1975, archaeologists discovered evidence of a port complex between Ratcliff and Shadwell, that was used throughout Roman occupation of Britain, and being most active in the 3rd century AD. The port seems to have initially been used for seagoing ships into the City of London, which is believed to have stopped between 250 and 270AD. A water level drop meant that the port was used primarily for the public bath house near St George in the East, which existed from the first to fourth centuries.

In 2019, remains of a Roman Bath House was located in Wapping Lane, on the northeast corner of Sovereign Close. 
Archaeologists has also found evidence of a late third-century signal tower in Shadwell. A Roman cemetery containing two coffins was also discovered in Shadwell in around 1615.

===Administrative history===
The area was part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, but military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets).

The role of the &quot;Tower Division&quot; ended when Shadwell became part of the new County of London in 1889. The County of London was replaced by Greater London in 1965.

=== 16th and 17th centuries ===
Shadwell&#x27;s eastern waterfront had been drained in the Middle Ages whilst the western waterfront had been drained during the reign of King Henry VIII, by Cornelius Vanderdelf after an act of Parliament. This had been caused by an increase in London&#x27;s maritime activities in the 16th century.

The riverside areas of East London experienced rapid, low quality development, that reached Shadwell in the late 16th century. Writing in 1598, John Stow describes the poverty of the riverside development that took place then, with its:
John Stow also recalls elm trees being felled in order to make way for tenements. Away from the river the area remained largely undeveloped. In 1650, Shadwell had 703 buildings. Of the houses, 195 were single-storey houses, 473 were two-storey houses, and 33 were three-storey houses, although many were subdivided. The population of Shadwell in 1650 was around 3,500. In the 1660s, a hearth tax was introduced, although around 50% of residents in Shadwell were deemed too poor to pay the tax.

In 1669, Thomas Neale became a local landowner, buying some land reclaimed from the river, and gained Shadwell parish status. In addition, Neale built 289 homes, a mill, and a market, and also established a waterworks on large ponds left by the draining of the marsh. The area had been largely undeveloped and he developed the waterfront, with houses behind as a speculation, and in doing so provided fresh water for Shadwell and Wapping. Shadwell&#x27;s maritime industries were further developed with roperies, tanneries, breweries, wharves, smiths, and numerous taverns, as well as the chapel of St Paul&#x27;s. Seventy-five sea captains are buried in its churchyard; Captain James Cook had his son baptised there. Shadwell&#x27;s new houses were built in an orderly fashion, so that the streets ran between Ratcliff Highway and Wapping Wall. In 1674, Shadwell had a population of around 8,000. The prosperity in this period has been linked to the road connections into London, which were maintained by wealthy taxpayers from Middlesex, Essex, Kent and Surrey.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
A database of UK newspaper adverts, seeking the capture and return of enslaved runaways, known today as Freedom Seekers has identified sisters living and working in Shadwell in the mid-1700s.

Jane Gray and her younger sister, Maria, were born in Antigua in 1739 and 1742. They were the enslaved domestic servants of Captain James Barrett and his family. In 1758, when they were 19 and 16 years old, parish records confirm that the Barrett family lived in Musick House Court, just opposite St Paul&#x27;s Church, Shadwell.

It is not clear how they entered Captain Barrett&#x27;s service but the surname, Gray, suggests a connection with the Gray family and their plantations in Antigua. John Gray Senior, owned Turnbulls and Gray&#x27;s Belfast amongst other property on the island, and he may have named the sisters after two of his daughters, who were also called Jane and Maria.

The sisters arranged their own baptisms, on different days, in July 1758. Not at St Pauls, in the parish they lived, but at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. It is possible that they intended to establish themselves in a different parish, and did not want the Barretts to know. Four months later, the sisters ran away.

By the mid-eighteenth century, Shadwell Spa was established, producing sulphurous waters, in Sun Tavern fields. As well as being used for medicinal purposes, salts were extracted from the waters and used by local calicoprinters to fix their dyes. By the mid-eighteenth century, many houses in Shadwell had been rebuilt. &quot;Seamen, watermen and lightermen, coalheavers and shopkeepers, and ropemakers, coopers, carpenters and smiths, lived in small lathe and plaster or weatherboard houses, two storeys and a garret high, with one room on each floor&quot;; the average rent was £2/7/0. In 1768, London coal workers who were protesting for higher wages began shooting at the landlord of the Roundabout Tavern in Shadwell; as a result, seven of them were hanged in the Sun Tavern fields. Their execution was witnessed by around 50,000 spectators, the largest crowd at a hanging since the hanging of Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers in 1760. in 1794, many houses on the Ratcliffe Highway were destroyed by a fire which &quot;consumed more houses than any one conflagration has done since the Great Fire of London&quot;, and also destroyed many boats, and around £40,000 of sugar.

Shadwell Waterworks was sold in 1801 to the London Dock Company; the waterworks were the first ones in London to use a Watt steam engine in 1788. The waterworks were later sold to the East London Waterwork Company for £300,000 in 1808, after an Act of Parliament allowed the company to obtain a compulsory purchase order. The modern area is dominated by the enclosed former dock, Shadwell Basin, whose construction destroyed much of the earlier settlement – by this time degenerated into slums. The basin once formed the eastern entrance to the then London Docks, with a channel leading west to St Katharine Docks. It is actually two dock basins – the south basin was constructed in 1828–32 and the north basin in 1854–8. A new entrance to Shadwell dock was opened in 1832, giving Shadwell access to the River Thames. Between 1854 and 1858, a 45 feet wide new entrance to the docks was constructed to allow larger ships into the dock. Shadwell Basin was one of three locked basins connecting the docks to the River Thames, and is the only one of the three still in existence today. In 1865, HMS Amazon docked at Shadwell Basin in order to pick up around 800 Mormons who were emigrating to America, and in 1869, the &quot;Blue Jacket&quot; clipper, then the fastest clipper in the world, began her journey to Canterbury, New Zealand in Shadwell Basin. In 1865 during excavation for the creations of some docks at Shadwell, four nearby houses were flooded. In 1844, Shadwell was recorded as having had a population of 10,060, and having ten almshouses built using money from James Cook. Watney Market developed into a busy shopping area around this time.

In the 19th century, Shadwell was home to a large community of foreign South Asian &quot;lascar&quot; seamen, working on the sea-lanes to British India. There were also Anglo-Indians, from intermarriage and cohabitation between &quot;lascar&quot; seamen and local girls. There were also smaller communities of Chinese and Greek seamen, who also intermarried and cohabited with locals. In 1805, lascars caused disturbances in the streets of Shadwell which ended with 15 people being hospitalised, and 19 people being arrested.

During Victorian times, Shadwell and the East End were not seen as pleasant places. The growth of Shadwell&#x27;s port led to an increase in the number of prostitutes in the area, and the area was known as the centre of the capital&#x27;s opium smoking, and in 1861, Shadwell paid a poor rate of 3 s. 9d. An 1889 book &quot;The Bitter Cry of Outcast London&quot; described Ratcliffe, Shadwell and Bermondsey as a &quot;revolting spectacle&quot;, a &quot;dark vision&quot;, and a &quot;ghastly reality&quot;, whilst Charles Dickens&#x27; unfinished novel &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; involves a journey to an opium den in Shadwell, which includes the line &quot;Eastward and still eastward through the stale streets he takes his way, until he reaches his destination: a miserable court, specially miserable amongst many such.&quot;

In 1885, Shadwell Fish Market was opened as an alternative to Billingsgate Fish Market. Although Shadwell had the advantage of three times the river frontage of Billingsgate and access via train, the fish market was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1901, it was sold to the City of London Corporation, and was eventually closed in 1914. The site later became King Edward Memorial Park in 1922, when it was opened by King George V, and was Shadwell&#x27;s first park. From 1868 to 1932, Shadwell was home to the East London Hospital for Children (later the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children), before it moved to Wapping, and was later closed down in 1963.

=== 20th century ===
In 1906, the Corporation of London agreed to contribute £500 to the widening of Shadwell High Street to .
In 1916, seven women were killed in a sack factory fire; around 50 women were in the building at the time, and the rest escaped. The five-storey warehouse was almost completely destroyed. In 1934, a bomb was found four feet below the surface of Shadwell High Street; the bomb was believed to be from the German World War I air raids on the area.

In 1936 residents of Shadwell were heavily involved in the Battle of Cable Street which took place nearby, when Oswald Mosley&#x27;s fascists attempted to march through the East End, in order to intimidate the area&#x27;s large Jewish population. The police ordered Mosley to abandon his march when 250,000 or more protestors blocked his way, and police attempts to clear a way for him were unsuccessful. Workers in Shadwell continued to oppose the British Union of Fascists, and in 1937, Shadwell dockers threatened an unofficial strike after local casual dock labourer Cecil Anthony Hiron was nominated as a BUF candidate in the Stepney Council elections in November; Hiron later withdrew his nomination.

In 1969, the Shadwell Docks, along with the other London docks, closed and were purchased by Tower Hamlets Council. During the 1970s, the docks became derelict, before being bought by the London Docklands Development Corporation, who built 169 houses and flats by the basin in 1987.

The Watney Market area was demolished and rebuilt during the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1987, Shadwell DLR station was opened, which connected Shadwell to Tower Gateway near Fenchurch Street, and later also Bank station from 1991.

==Parish church==
St. Paul&#x27;s Shadwell with St. James Ratcliffe, is traditionally known as the &quot;Church of Sea Captains&quot;. In 1656 the church was established as a &quot;Chapel of Ease&quot;, from St Dunstan&#x27;s, at Stepney. In 1669, it was rebuilt as the Parish Church of Shadwell, and it was the last of five parish churches rebuilt after the Restoration. In 1820, it was again rebuilt as a &#x27;Waterloo church&#x27;. Captain James Cook was an active parishioner and John Wesley preached in the church from time to time. Isham Randolph of Dungeness, one of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s grandfathers and son of William Randolph, was married in St. Paul&#x27;s church.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Shadwell railway station is located just north of Cable Street, the area&#x27;s historic northern boundary with the St. George in the East area of Wapping. It is situated on the London Overground&#x27;s East London line and is in Travelcard Zone 2. There are regular direct services to , Highbury &amp; Islington, West Croydon, , and .

Shadwell DLR station lies 50 metres to the north of the railway station and re-uses the former Shadwell &amp; St. George&#x27;s East railway station; this took its name from its location on the boundary of the two areas and closed in 1941. Services operate regularly between Bank and Lewisham.

===Buses===
London bus services in the area are operated primarily by Blue Triangle, London Central and Stagecoach London. Routes include the 15, 100, 108, 115, 135, D3 and night bus N15; these connect Shadwell with East and Central London.

==THCH Hop Festival==

In 2006 local Housing Association, Tower Hamlets Community Housing (THCH) built a new block of flats in Shadwell, adjacent to the existing flats at the corner of Cable Street and Devonport Street, called Thirza House. It was opened by Mildred Gordon, a former Shadwell resident and MP for the area from 1987 to 1997. As part of the new development THCH built a hop garden.

Since 2007, THCH have held a Hop Festival every September in the hop garden to commemorate the tradition of generations of East Enders temporarily migrating to Kent&#x27;s hop gardens to harvest the hops. THCH have produced souvenir booklets containing historical photos of East Enders harvesting hops which are available from Tower Hamlets Community Housing. In 2009 the Shadwell hops were harvested by the local residents and Brodies Brewery in Leyton used them to create a new beer called &quot;Old Hopper&#x27;s Brew&quot;. The beer sold out within a month.

==In popular culture==
Wilfred Owen&#x27;s poem &quot;Shadwell Stair&quot;, previously alleged to be mysterious, was a straightforward elegy to homosexual soliciting in an area of the London docks once renowned for it, according to Jonathan Cutbill.

The 1967 film &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; was shot in Shadwell.

The music video of the 1984 song &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; by Bronski Beat was filmed at St George&#x27;s Leisure Centre, a municipal swimming baths in Shadwell.

<text>A dead end, also known as a cul-de-sac (; , ), a no-through road or a no-exit road, is a street with only one combined inlet and outlet.

Dead ends are added to roads in urban planning designs to limit traffic in residential areas. Some dead ends prohibit all-through traffic, while others allow cyclists, pedestrians, or other non-automotive traffic to pass through connecting easements or paths. The latter case is an example of filtered permeability. 

The International Federation of Pedestrians proposed calling such streets &quot;living end streets&quot; and to provide signage at the entry of the streets that clearly indicates non-automotive permeability. This would retain the dead end&#x27;s primary function as a non-through road, but establish complete pedestrian and bicycle network connectivity.

&quot;Dead end&quot; is not the most commonly used expression in all English-speaking regions. Official terminology and traffic signs include many alternatives; some are only used regionally. In the UK, a dead end residential street is sometimes called a &quot;close&quot;. In the United States, a &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; is often not an exact synonym for &quot;dead end,” as it refers explicitly to a dead-end street with a circular end, making it easier for vehicles to turn around. Street names are determined at the city or county level, with most choosing to use &quot;court&quot; for a bulbous cul-de-sac. In Australia, a street with a bulbous end is usually referred to as a &quot;court&quot;, although the naming decision ultimately rests with the state or territory authority. In Canada, where street names are decided on the municipal level, cul-de-sacs are usually named &quot;courts&quot;. 

==History==

The earliest examples of dead ends were unearthed in the El Lahun workers&#x27; village in Egypt, which was built in 1885 BC. The village was planned and built orthogonally with straight streets that intersect at right angles in an irregular grid. The western section of the excavated village, once home to the workers, featured fifteen narrow, short dead ends arranged perpendicularly on either side of a wider, straight street and ending at the enclosing walls.

Dead end streets also appeared during the classical periods of Athens and Rome. The 15th century architect and planner Leon Battista Alberti implies in his writings that dead end streets may have been used intentionally in antiquity for defense purposes:

The same opinion is expressed by Aristotle when he criticized the Hippodamian grid:

Inferential evidence of their earlier use can also be drawn from the writings of German architect Rudolf Eberstadt, which that explains the purpose of dead-end streets:

It was in the United Kingdom that the cul-de-sac street type was first legislated into use, with the Hampstead Garden Suburb Act of 1906. The proponents of the Act, Raymond Unwin and Barry Parker, thus gained permission to introduce cul-de-sacs in their subsequent site plans, and they promoted it as a suitable street type for garden suburbs. Unwin&#x27;s applications of the cul-de-sac and the related crescent always included pedestrian paths independent of the road network. This design feature reflects the predominance of pedestrian movement for local trips at the turn of the 20th century, and presages the current planning priority for increased pedestrian accessibility. The 1906 Act defined the nature of the cul-de-sac as a non-through road and restricted its length to . Garden cities in the UK that followed Hampstead, such as Welwyn Garden City, all included cul-de-sacs.

In the 1920s, the garden city movement became more popular in the United States and, with it, came its design elements, such as the cul-de-sac. Clarence Stein, a main proponent of the movement, incorporated it in the Radburn, New Jersey (1929) subdivision, which was to become a model for subsequent neighborhood developments. The first modern cul-de-sac (1922) in America might be found in Buffalo, New York.

The country&#x27;s Federal Housing Authority (FHA) recommended and promoted their use through their 1936 guidelines and the power of lending development funds.

In Canada, a variation of Stein&#x27;s Radburn 1929 plan that used crescents (loops) instead of cul-de-sacs was built in 1947: Wildwood Park, Winnipeg, designed by Hubert Bird. In 1954, the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation published its own guidelines in which the cul-de-sac was strongly recommended for local streets and, as the FHA in the US, used its lending power to see its inclusion in development plans. Varsity Village and Braeside, subdivisions in Calgary, Alberta, also used the Radburn model in the late 1960s.

In the 1960s the cul-de-sac attained systematic international application in planned new cities such as Doxiadis&#x27; Islamabad (1960). In the UK, new towns such as Harlow (1947) by Sir Frederick Gibberd and Milton Keynes (1967) incorporated cul-de-sacs and crescents in their layouts.

Planning theorists have suggested the use of alternatives to cul-de-sacs. Most notably, Christopher Alexander et al., in his 1977 book &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; (pattern #49) suggests the use of looped local roads which do not abruptly stop. Although dead end streets would fit his definition of looped local roads, Alexander suggestions that &quot;cul-de-sacs [sic] are very bad from a social standpoint—they force interaction and they feel claustrophobic, because there is only one entrance&quot;. Doxiadis has additionally argued their important role in separating man from machine.

===Originally-unplanned dead ends===

Originally-unplanned dead ends have been added in city centers that are laid out on a grid by blocking through-traffic. Whole neighbourhood street reconfigurations emerged in several cities, mainly concentrated in North America and the UK, which include Berkeley, California; Seattle, Washington; and Vancouver, British Columbia. The transformation of grid plans since the 1970s limits access to an existing road that is newly designated as a major artery, enabling traffic to move smoothly on it, alleviating residents&#x27; concerns.

This selective, sporadic transformation has been continuing into the 21st century. City planners sometimes, as traffic volumes increase and as cities decide to remove or reduce traffic on specific streets of central areas, streets are closed off using bollards or landscaping. As such, these actions make new, originally unplanned dead ends and producing a new, functional blend of the inherited grid with newer street types. A common variation of limiting traffic is managed via closure of retractable bollards that are activated only by designated card-holders.

==Suburban use and benefits==
Since the end of World War II, new subdivisions in the United States and Canada, as well as New Towns in England and other countries have made extensive use of the cul-de-sac and crescent (loops) street types. Typically, there is one or several central roads in the subdivision with many cul-de-sac streets of varying length, branching out from the main roads, to fill the land in the subdivision, a dendrite or hierarchical pattern. Since the 1960s, the pattern has been the dominant road network structure of suburbs and exurbs in the United States, Canada, and Australia. It is also increasingly popular in Latin America, Western Europe, and China. In this pattern, there are only a few roads (relative to the number of cul-de-sac streets) leading out of the subdivision and into other subdivisions or onto major roads.

In the US, these changes can be attributed to real-estate developers&#x27; desire to meet FHA guidelines and make federal home loans available to their customers. In Canada, a similar incentive was provided to developers by CMHC. The incentives, which were discontinued in the 1970s, gave the initial impetus for the application of the hierarchical pattern. In other countries, such incentives do not exist, and adoption is motivated by customer preferences.

American urban planning, in the 19th and the early 20th centuries, emphasized a grid plan, partly out of extensive reliance on foot, horse, and trams for transportation. In such earlier urban development, alleys were included to allow for deliveries of soiled supplies, such as coal, to the rear of houses, which are now heated by electricity, piped natural gas or oil.

===Effects on local traffic===

The use of cul-de-sacs has been shown to reduce the volume of car traffic on residential streets within a subdivision which in turn can reduce noise, air pollution, and the probability of accidents. 

Ben-Joseph (1995), and Lovegrove and Sayed (2006), indicate a substantially lower collision rate for street networks based on the cul-de-sac street type. Dumbaugh and Rae (2009) suggest that land-use patterns play a significant role in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern. While all intersection types in general increase the incidence of fatal crashes, four-way intersections, which rarely occur in a network with cul-de-sac or loop streets, increase total and injurious crashes significantly. This study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections, and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable.

In turn, the decrease in traffic is thought to lower the incidence of crime and increase desirability, because in most cases the people who traverse the cul-de-sac either live there or are guests of those who do. CPTED planning principles suggest increased natural surveillance and sense of ownership as a means of fostering security in a neighborhood. Both of these phenomena occur naturally on a cul-de-sac street as does social networking. Design guidelines based on the CPTED perspective recommend its use for those reasons.

Cul-de-sac streets increase spontaneous outdoor activity by children. A study in California examined the amount of child play that occurred on the streets of neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and cul-de-sacs. The findings indicate that cul-de-sacs showed substantial increase in play activity than the open grid street pattern. Cul-de-sacs reduce perceived danger from traffic, thereby encouraging more outdoor play.
Similar studies in Europe and Australia found that children&#x27;s outdoor play is significantly reduced on through roads where traffic is, or perceived by parents to be, a risk. In addition, they confirmed the results of the seminal Donald Appleyard 1982 study, which showed the negative correlation between amount of traffic and social networks. The inverse correlation between amounts of traffic and sociability of streets was reconfirmed by a newer study that repeated Appleyard&#x27;s San Francisco analysis in Bristol, UK. It showed that the cul-de-sac street with the lowest traffic of the three streets had the highest level of social interaction.

The studies recommend the use of the cul-de-sac or strong traffic calming measures. When cul-de-sacs are interconnected with foot and bike paths, as for example in Vauban, Freiburg and Village Homes in Davis, California, they can increase active modes of mobility among their residents.

===Real estate desirability===
Real estate developers prefer cul-de-sacs because they allow builders to fit more houses into oddly-shaped tracts of land and facilitate building to the edges of rivers and property lines. They also choose these discontinuous network patterns of cul-de-sac and loop streets because of the often significant economies in infrastructure costs compared to the grid plan.

From an environmental perspective, cul-de-sacs allow greater flexibility than the common grid in adapting to the natural grades of a site and to its ecologically sensitive features, such as streams, creeks, and mature forest growth.

The desirability of the cul-de-sac street type among home buyers is implied by the evidence that they often pay up to a 20% premium for a home on such a street, according to one study. That could be because there is considerably less passing traffic, resulting in less noise and reduced actual or perceived risk, increasing the sense of tranquility. A survey of residents on three types of streets: cul-de-sac, loop, and through (grid) recorded their preferences among these types. It found that 82% of cul-de-sac residents preferred their own street type, 18% preferred a loop, and 0% the grid. Only 13% of grid street residents preferred their own type and 54% would choose a cul-de-sac.
Two other studies, reported in 1990 and 2009 respectively, confirmed the upward trend and determined the premium that cul-de-sac streets command. The first found a 29% premium over the streets in a grid. The second, focused on trails and greenbelts, found that other amenities including cul-de-sac streets add significantly to the home value.

The positive feelings that a cul-de-sac street could evoke, that residents value, are expressed vividly by Allan Jacobs in describing Roslyn Place, a short (), narrow (), densely built (), and wood-paved cul-de-sac in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: &quot;Step into Roslyn Place and you are likely to sense, immediately, that you are in a &quot;place&quot;, a special place, a handsome place, a safe place, a welcoming place, a place where you might wish to live.&quot; &quot;narrowness and enclosure and intimacy bring a feeling of safety to Roslyn Place... &#x27;Stay on our street&#x27; is all the kids have to know&quot;.

Gated communities, whose numbers are steadily increasing worldwide , use cul-de-sac and loop street networks because the dendrite structure reduces the number of through roads and thus the corresponding number of entries and exits that need to be controlled.

==Criticisms and discussion==


===Traffic safety===
Dead ends are traditionally considered safer traffic environments for children than normal streets, but research shows that areas with many dead ends in fact have higher rates of traffic accidents involving young children.

This increased risk of death is due to multiple factors, including:
* families living on dead end streets drive longer distances to reach their destinations,
* parents living on dead end streets spend less time teaching their children to be as wary of traffic, and
* an increased risk of the parents accidentally driving over the children in front of their own homes.

===Environmental effects===
Cul-de-sacs are criticised by urban designers like those of the Foundation for the Built Environment in the UK for encouraging car transport for even short distances, as more direct connections are precluded by the geometry, which necessitates long travel distances even to physically-nearby locations. This increases fuel consumption and vehicle emissions and has negative effects on health by reducing walking and cycling rates. Related research in the United States by Richard Jackson has shown that people in car-based (cul-de-sac heavy) communities weigh on average more than those in traditional towns (with open grid networks).

===Health effects===

An extensive analysis of the research evidence by TRB, however, shows only an association between the built environment and physical activity levels, not causal connections. The evidence also does not identify with certainty which characteristics of the built environment are most closely associated with physical activity behaviour. The study also warns against confusing inadequate physical activity with obesity which is the outcome of an energy imbalance. Many contemporary lifestyle trends, some inevitable (sedentary work) and some avoidable (frequent energy-rich food consumption or the watching of television [four hours per day]), contribute to the imbalance and must be considered in understanding and combating obesity.

The impermeability deficiency of the typical cul-de-sac street can be addressed by applying a modified, improved version of it, mentioned above, that enables pedestrian and bicycle through-movement. While this more permeable version can be applied in new developments easily, modifying existing impermeable cul-de-sac streets is problematic as it encounters property ownership issues. Efforts in that direction are, however, being made. Because of the complicated legal process and the sheer number of existing cul-de-sac streets, however, such efforts would be slow to produce results and may have little impact in changing the landscape of existing districts. 

Conversely, transforming existing streets that are part of a grid plan into permeable, linked cul-de-sacs, as was done in Berkeley, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia, is physically and administratively easy due to the public ownership of the street right-of-way. However, residents on adjacent through roads may resent the potential traffic increase and delay the process. In Berkeley, the barriers used were permeable to both pedestrian and bicycle traffic and became a critical feature of the bicycle boulevard system in that region.

Increases in pedestrian and bicycle permeability may result in a displacement of local car trips for short-distance destinations, and consequently a reduction in neighbourhood vehicle emissions. The impermeable cul-de-sac not only discourages walking and biking but also increases the length of car trips by the circuitous geometry of the dendrite network structure of which it is a part. 

Research studies examined the influence of several variables on the amount of car travel that residents of several types of districts recorded. Results vary considerably among them, but there is general agreement on a number of key correlations: a) the wealthier and the larger the family is, the more cars they own, and the more they drive, b) the farther away a family lives from the city centre, and the fewer the jobs in the vicinity, plus a slow bus service, the more they drive, and c) street patterns may add a 10% length to local trips, but the total VKTs are affected more by the &quot;macro&quot; urban than the &quot;micro&quot; neighbourhood structure.

===Safety and crime===
Cul-de-sacs, especially those that also limit pedestrian routes instead of only road-traffic routes, have also been criticised for negative effects on safety because they decrease the amount of through-traffic (vehicular or pedestrian) that might notice an accident or crime victim in need of help. Proponents of cul-de-sacs and gated communities have in turn countered that the reduction in through-traffic makes any &quot;stranger&quot; much more recognisable in the closed local environment and thus reduces crime danger. That view has in turn been characterized as unrealistic. It is argued that, since only very few of all non-locals passing through the area are potential criminals, increased traffic should increase rather than decrease safety.

Research has expanded the discussion on the disputed issue. A 2008 study did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified subtle nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, a) dwelling types, b) unit density (site density) c) movement on the street, d) cul-de-sacs or grids, and e) the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that a) flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters, b) density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level, c) local movement is beneficial but larger-scale movement not so, d) relative affluence and the number of neighbours has a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through-street. It also established again that simple, linear cul-de-sacs with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The overprovision of poorly-used permeability is a crime hazard.

===Isolation and connection===

More generally, the New Urbanism movement has offered criticism of the cul-de-sac and crescent (loop) street types not intended to network with each other. It has been suggested that such street layouts can cause increased traffic on the collector streets. It is recognized that cul-de-sacs and looped streets inherently remove car traffic through them and restrict access to residents only. Resident traffic is naturally channelled to minor residential collectors and to arterials that provide inter-neighbourhood and inter-district connectivity. 

A study, reported in 1990, compared the traffic performance in a development that was laid out using two approaches, one with and the other without hierarchy or cul-de-sac streets. It concluded that the non-hierarchical, traditional layout generally shows lower peak speed and shorter, more frequent intersection delays than the hierarchical pattern. The traditional pattern is not as conducive to long trips as the hierarchical but more conducive to short trips. Local trips in it are shorter in distance but about equivalent in time with the hierarchical layout. A later similar comparative traffic study of about concluded that all types of layouts perform adequately in most land-use scenarios and that a refined hierarchical, dendrite network can improve traffic performance.

Anecdotal and research evidence suggests that navigation (especially on foot) in a disconnected network of cul-de-sac and looped streets is inconvenient and non-intuitive, particularly when combined with curvilinear geometry. Loss of orientation and sense of direction is also a common experience in older cities with cul-de-sac streets (Medina of Arab cities or Mediterranean hill towns) as well as in cities with highly-irregular block geometries and sizes and corresponding street alignments that produce a labyrinthine effect. The long history of such cities implies that an irregular, complicated street network that appears entirely illegible to a visitor is well understood and used by the inhabitants. More convincing about its workability for their permanent residents are the case histories of cities such as Regensburg that show a gradual transformation of an imported or imposed orthogonal, &quot;legible&quot; grid to the traditional &quot;confusing&quot; street networks.

Cul-de-sac and loop streets can reduce the size of any given neighbourhood to a single street. Neighbourhoods can be defined by geographic boundaries but more often it is shared ethnic, socioeconomic and cultural characteristics that produce social cohesion irrespective of apparent physical &quot;boundaries&quot;. Mehaffy &quot;et al.&quot; (2010), who propose a model for structuring an urban network, suggest that neighbourhoods cannot be designed into being. &quot;Community&quot; is viewed as a dynamic social and cultural construct, especially in contemporary, open, multicultural cities. Residential area street configuration can assist its emergence only by reducing through-traffic and increasing local pedestrian movementa design goal for which connected cul-de-sac and looped streets are suited.

Issues of pedestrian trip length and isolation are very evident in the back-to-front housing arrangement where the front of the house fronts onto the cul-de-sac street while the rear fronts onto the main roads. Some of the problems can be mitigated by the newer practice of connecting the neighbouring roads and cul-de-sacs with public pedestrian or cycle paths. In effect, this removes the discontinuity aspect for these modes of transport. Built examples of such connected cul-de-sacs can be found in the United States (such as Radburn, New Jersey, and Village Homes, California), England (such as Milton Keynes), and Greece (such as Papagou, a suburb of Athens). Acknowledging their use, Germany, under the 2009 amendment to the Road Traffic Act, introduced an additional sign for cul-de-sacs that are permeable to pedestrians and cyclists (see under signage below). A new system for organizing connected, permeable cul-de-sacs into complete neighbourhoods, the fused grid, has been developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

===Density===

In the development context and planning literature of North America, cul-de-sacs have been associated with low-density residential development. Sustainable development theorists and proponents claim that to be, in some undefined way, inefficient. The increased prevalence of cul-de-sac streets occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, a period of rapid economic and city expansion, when a detached house on a large lot meant an ideal form of habitation. The temporal coincidence of the wide adoption of a street type and an increasing demand for large lots and houses suggests a necessary relationship between street type and unit density. 

Historically, however, the earliest systematic application of the cul-de-sac street type by Raymond Unwin (1909) had a unit density between , considerably higher than mid-to-late 20th century. Even in the 21st century, developments rarely achieve densities above in the suburbs. Conversely, early 1950s suburban developments that were laid out on a grid exhibit similar low densities. Evidently, street, network type and density are not linked causally; other factors, such as land scarcity and income, influence the outcome as, for example, in cities that are landlocked or that have low average incomes.

===Accessibility of services===
Another concern is often voiced by emergency services, which can have difficulty locating streets when a community consists of a large number of similarly named cul-de-sacs; also, large fire response vehicles, in particular, can have great difficulty with turning around in a cul-de-sac. However, confusing street naming is not a necessary outcome of street network design and can be improved. The practice of naming orthogonal networks by numbers and letters in the corresponding cardinal directions has been criticized by Camilo Sitte as lacking imagination. Nonetheless, police and fire departments now use advanced GPS systems that quickly locate the destination and the shortest path to follow.

School buses can also have a hard time turning around, which means that children who live in a cul-de-sac must often walk to a bus stop on a main through-road. However, research on obesity and urban planning suggests that to be a possible advantage because it enables children to get daily physical activity. Longer walking distances, however, reduce interest in using buses especially when a car is available. This disincentive to walking to a school bus-stop can be overcome in planned cul-de-sac streets by regulating their maximum length to about , as was recommended and practiced by R. Unwin and others.

===Regulation===
Weighing available evidence has led a few US cities including Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Portland, Oregon, to restrict and regulate the inclusion of cul-de-sac streets in new suburbs. However, a 2010 study on sprawl in North America by a legal expert concludes that &quot;neighborhoods dominated by cul-de-sacs are less walkable than those that include street grids. On the other hand, cul-de-sacs do have a countervailing public benefit: because of their very inaccessibility, they tend to have less automobile traffic. 

Given the existence of important public policy goals on both sides, a city seeking to maximize walkability should not favor cul-de-sacs over grids, but should also allow some cul-de-sacs as a legitimate residential option.In addition, there are &quot;middle ground&quot; alternatives between prohibiting cul-de-sacs and mandating them. For example, a city could encourage cul-de-sacs combined with pedestrian walkways.&quot; This design combination is shown in the Village Homes layout and is an integral part of the Fused Grid.

==Terminology==
The expression &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; comes from French, where it originally meant &quot;bottom of a sack&quot;. It was first used in English in anatomy (since 1738). It was used for dead end streets since 1800 in English (since the 14th century in French). The often-heard erroneous folk etymology &quot;arse/ass [buttocks] of the sack&quot; is based on the modern meaning of &quot;cul&quot; in French, Catalan, and Occitan, but &quot;cul&quot; does not have that meaning in &quot;cul-de-sac&quot;, which is still used to refer to dead ends in modern Frenchalthough the terms and are more common.

George Orwell wrote in his 1946 article &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; that the term &quot;cul de sac&quot; is another foreign word used in English as pretentious diction and is unnecessary. 

J. R. R. Tolkien used the name Bag End as a translation of &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; to poke fun at the British use of French terms.

The word &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; and its not french synonyms or near synonyms &quot;dead end&quot; and &quot;no exit&quot; have inspired metaphorical uses in literature and in culture, often with the result that a word or phrase seeming to have a negative connotation is replaced in street signs with a new coinage (&quot;no outlet&quot; is another alternative name used on street signs). 

===Australia===
In Australia, dead end streets are signposted as and often referred to as a &quot;no-through road&quot;. Suffixes for these types of streets include &quot;court&quot;, &quot;close&quot; or &quot;place&quot;. The term &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; generally only refers to a reasonably short street with a bulbous end, or even only to the end portion. A long road that is a no-through road and terminates abruptly is usually called a dead end.

===Canada===
In Canada, &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; is commonly used in speech but &quot;no-exit&quot; or &quot;no-through road&quot; is more common in road signs, especially in western Canada. In Quebec and Newfoundland, &quot;cul-de-Sac&quot; is in far more common use, although Quebec uses &quot;impasse&quot; too.

===France===

Cul de sac is French for &#x27;bag-bottom&#x27;.

===Italy===

Roads in Italy are an important mode of transport in Italy. In Italy, terms commonly used in speech for dead-end street include &quot;strada senza uscita&quot; (&quot;dead end road&quot;) and &quot;cul-de-sac&quot;. Metaphorically, in Italy, the expression &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; is used to indicate an inextricable stalemate.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, dead end streets are sometimes signposted as &quot;No Exit&quot;, but are often not signposted at all. The terms &#x27;cul-de-sac&#x27; and &#x27;dead end&#x27; have the same senses as in Australia. Similarly to Australia, residential cul-de-sacs with bulbous ends are often suffixed with &quot;Place&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;Pl&quot; on street signs.

===United Kingdom===

In British English, the phrase &quot;close&quot; is generally used as a suffix for residential cul-de-sac roads, although several variants exist similar to those used in Commonwealth countries.

===United States===
US Federal Highway Administration rules state: &quot;The &quot;Dead End&quot; sign may be used at the entrance of a single road or street that terminates in a dead end or cul-de-sac. The &quot;No Outlet&quot; sign may be used at the entrance to a road or road network from which there is no other exit.&quot; There is no federal regulation on &quot;no exit&quot;.

The phrase &quot;No Exit&quot; is also preferred for Chicago signs, although &quot;dead end&quot; is still used there. New York City has favored &quot;dead end&quot; since at least the 1930s, when Sidney Kingsley used the phrase to title his Broadway play about poor, tough East Side youths with lives of little promise, in contrast to the dead end streets of the nearby Sutton Place neighborhood. (Similarly, French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre titled a play about three damned sinners, &quot;Huis Clos&quot;, translated into English as &quot;No Exit&quot;.) Kingsley&#x27;s play was later made into a movie, &quot;Dead End&quot;, which proved so popular that it spawned similar movies, many starring a group of recurring characters known as the Dead End Kids. The play and movies produced such a strong image of bleak futures and an unfair society that some municipalities changed the sign terminology for cul-de-sacs, often to &quot;no outlet&quot; or &quot;no exit&quot;. (The &quot;dead end&quot; signs currently at Sutton Place are bright yellow with black lettering.)

In New York City, as of 2008, there were 4,659 &quot;dead end&quot; traffic signs, along with 160 &quot;no outlet&quot; signs. The city records, which go back to the 1960s, show only a couple of &quot;no exit&quot; signs once existing near the approaches to the Midtown Tunnel, and which are no longer there. New York City Commissioner of Transportation Janette Sadik-Khan said in 2008: &quot;We hear that some towns use &#x27;no outlet&#x27; instead of &#x27;dead end&#x27; because they think it sounds less morbid.&quot; &quot;We tell New Yorkers the truth: it&#x27;s a &#x27;dead end&#x27;, and we think that motorists get the point quickly.&quot;

California uses the phrase &quot;Not a Through Street&quot; or &quot;Not a Through Road&quot; to mark roads or road systems that end in cul-de-sacs. More recently, &quot;No Outlet&quot; has been shown on some signs as well (an example being Meyers Avenue south of Eureka Street in the Pine Hills area).

===Other uses===
In military parlance, a &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; refers to a situation where an army is &quot;hemmed in on all sides but behind&quot;. &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot; is also used metaphorically to mean a line of thought or action that leads nowhere.

In medicine, the expression is used to refer to the recto-uterine pouch, also known as the Pouch of Douglas, the deepest point of the female peritoneal cavity.

<text>Gilding is a decorative technique for applying a very thin coating of gold over solid surfaces such as metal (most common), wood, porcelain, or stone. A gilded object is also described as &quot;gilt&quot;. Where metal is gilded, the metal below was traditionally silver in the West, to make silver-gilt (or &quot;vermeil&quot;) objects, but gilt-bronze is commonly used in China, and also called ormolu if it is Western. Methods of gilding include hand application and gluing, typically of gold leaf, chemical gilding, and electroplating, the last also called gold plating. Parcel-gilt (partial gilt) objects are only gilded over part of their surfaces. This may mean that all of the inside, and none of the outside, of a chalice or similar vessel is gilded, or that patterns or images are made up by using a combination of gilt and ungilted areas.

Gilding gives an object a gold appearance at a fraction of the cost of creating a solid gold object. In addition, a solid gold piece would often be too soft or too heavy for practical use. A gilt surface also does not tarnish as silver does.

Modern gilding is applied to numerous and diverse surfaces and by various processes. More traditional techniques still form an important part of framemaking and are sometimes still employed in general woodworking, cabinet-work, decorative painting and interior decoration, bookbinding, and ornamental leather work, and in the decoration of pottery, porcelain, and glass.

== History ==

Herodotus mentions that the Egyptians gilded wood and metals, and many such objects have been excavated. Certain Ancient Greek statues of great prestige were chryselephantine, i.e., made of gold (for the clothing) and ivory (for the flesh); these however, were constructed with sheets of gold over a timber framework, not gilded. Extensive ornamental gilding was also used in the ceiling coffers of the Propylaea.

Pliny the Elder recorded that the first gilding seen at Rome was after the destruction of Carthage, under the censorship of Lucius Mummius, when the Romans began to gild the ceilings of their temples and palaces, the Capitol being the first place where this process was used. Gilding became a popular luxury within Rome soon after the introduction of the technique, with gilding soon being seen used on the walls, vaults and inside the houses of anyone who could afford it, including the poor. Owing to the comparative thickness of the gold leaf used in ancient gilding, the traces of it that remain are remarkably brilliant and solid. Fire-gilding of metal goes back at least to the 4th century BC. Mercury-gilding was invented by Chinese Daoists in the 4th century CE and was used for the gilding of bronze plaques. It was known to Pliny (33,20,64–5), Vitruvius (8,8,4) and in the early medieval period to Theophilus (De Diversis Artibus Book III).

In Europe, silver-gilt has always been more common than gilt-bronze, but in China the opposite has been the case. The ancient Chinese also developed the gilding of porcelain, which was later taken up by the French and other European potters.

== Mechanical gilding ==

Mechanical gilding includes all the operations in which gold leaf is prepared, and the processes to mechanically attach the gold onto surfaces. The techniques include burnishing, water gilding and oil-gilding used by wood carvers and gilders; and the gilding operations of the house decorator, sign painter, bookbinder, the paper stainer and several others.

Polished iron, steel and other metals are gilded mechanically by applying gold leaf to the metallic surface at a temperature just under red-hot, pressing the leaf on with a burnisher, then reheating when additional leaf may be laid on. The process is completed by cold burnishing.

&quot;Overlaying&quot; or folding or hammering on gold foil or gold leaf is the simplest and most ancient method, and is mentioned in Homer&#x27;s Odyssey and the Old Testament. The &quot;Ram in a Thicket&quot; (2600–2400 BC) from Ur describes this technique used on wood, with a thin layer of bitumen underneath to help adhesion.

The next advances involved two simple processes. The first involves gold leaf, which is gold that is hammered or cut into very thin sheets. Gold leaf is often thinner than standard paper today, and when held to the light is semi-transparent. In ancient times it was typically about ten times thicker than today, and perhaps half that in the Middle Ages.

If gilding on canvas or on wood, the surface was often first coated with gesso. &quot;Gesso&quot; is a substance made of finely ground gypsum or chalk mixed with glue. Once the coating of gesso had been applied, allowed to dry, and smoothed, it was re-wet with a sizing made of rabbit-skin glue and water (&quot;water gilding&quot;, which allows the surface to be subsequently burnished to a mirror-like finish) or boiled linseed oil mixed with litharge (&quot;oil gilding&quot;, which does not) and the gold leaf was layered on using a gilder&#x27;s tip and left to dry before being burnished with a piece of polished agate. Those gilding on canvas and parchment also sometimes employed stiffly-beaten egg whites (&quot;glair&quot;), gum, and/or Armenian bole as sizing, though egg whites and gum both become brittle over time, causing the gold leaf to crack and detach, and so honey was sometimes added to make them more flexible.

Other gilding processes involved using the gold as pigment in paint: the artist ground the gold into a fine powder and mixed it with a binder such as gum arabic. The resulting gold paint, called shell gold, was applied in the same way as with any paint. Sometimes, after either gold-leafing or gold-painting, the artist would heat the piece enough to melt the gold slightly, ensuring an even coat. These techniques remained the only alternatives for materials like wood, leather, the vellum pages of illuminated manuscripts, and gilt-edged stock.

== Chemical gilding ==
Chemical gilding embraces those processes in which the gold is at some stage of chemical combination. These include cold gilding, wet gilding, fire gilding and depletion gilding.

=== Cold gilding ===

In cold gilding, the gold is obtained in a state of extremely fine division (i.e. atomized or finely powdered), and applied by mechanical means. Cold gilding on silver is performed by a solution of gold in aqua regia, applied by dipping a linen rag into the solution, burning it, and rubbing the black and heavy ashes on the silver with the finger or a piece of leather or cork.

=== Wet gilding ===

Wet gilding is effected by means of a dilute solution of gold(III) chloride in aqua regia with twice its quantity of ether. The liquids are agitated and allowed to rest, to allow the ether to separate and float on the surface of the acid. The whole mixture is then poured into a separating funnel with a small aperture, and allowed to rest for some time, when the acid is run off from below and the gold dissolved in ether separated. The ether will be found to have taken up all the gold from the acid, and may be used for gilding iron or steel, for which purpose the metal is polished with fine emery and spirits of wine. The ether is then applied with a small brush, and as it evaporates it deposits the gold, which can now be heated and polished. For small delicate figures, a pen or a fine brush may be used for laying on the ether solution. The gold(III) chloride can also be dissolved in water in electroless plating wherein the gold is slowly reduced out of solution onto the surface to be gilded. When this technique is used on the second surface of glass and backed with silver, it is known as &quot;Angel gilding&quot;.

=== Fire gilding ===
Fire-gilding or wash-gilding is a process by which an amalgam of gold is applied to metallic surfaces, the mercury being subsequently volatilized, leaving a film of gold or an amalgam containing 13 to 16% mercury. In the preparation of the amalgam, the gold must first be reduced to thin plates or grains, which are heated red-hot, and thrown into previously heated mercury, until it begins to smoke. When the mixture is stirred with an iron rod, the gold is totally absorbed. The proportion of mercury to gold is generally six or eight to one. When the amalgam is cold, it is squeezed through chamois leather to separate the superfluous mercury; the gold, with about twice its weight of mercury, remains behind, forming a yellowish silvery mass with the consistency of butter.

When the metal to be gilded is wrought or chased, the application of mercury before the amalgam is applied allows for it to be more easily spread. When the surface of the metal is plain, the amalgam can be applied to it directly. When no such preparation is applied, the surface to be gilded is simply bitten and cleaned with nitric acid. A deposit of mercury is obtained on a metallic surface by means of quicksilver water, a solution of mercury(II) nitrate, the nitric acid attacking the metal to which it is applied, and thus leaving a film of free metallic mercury.

After the amalgam is equally spread over the prepared surface of the metal, the mercury is then carefully volatilized with heat just sufficient to do so, as a temperature too high may cause part of the gold to be driven off, or otherwise run together, leaving some of the metal surface bare.

When the mercury has evaporated, indicated by the surface taking on a dull yellow color, the metal must undergo further steps to exhibit its fine gold color. First, the gilded surface is rubbed with a scratch brush of brass wire, until its surface is smooth. It is then covered with gilding wax, and again exposed to fire until the wax is burnt off. Gilding wax is composed of beeswax mixed with some of the following substances: red ochre, verdigris, copper scales, alum, vitriol, and borax. By this operation the color of the gilding is heightened, as a result of the perfect dissipation of some of the remaining mercury. The gilt surface is then covered over with potassium nitrate, alum or other salts, ground together, and mixed into a paste with water or weak ammonia. The piece of metal is then exposed to heat, before being quenched in water.

By this method, the color of the gilding is further improved and brought nearer to that of gold, probably by removing any particles of copper that may have been on the gilt surface. This process, when skillfully carried out, produces gilding of great solidity and beauty. This method of gilding metallic objects was formerly widespread, but fell into disuse as the dangers of mercury toxicity became known. Since fire-gilding requires that the mercury be volatilized to drive off the mercury and leave the gold behind on the surface, it is extremely dangerous. Breathing the fumes generated by this process can quickly result in serious health problems, such as neurological damage and endocrine disorders, since inhalation is a very efficient route for mercuric compounds to enter the body; the mercury used in the process also evaporates into the atmosphere, thus polluting it. This process has generally been supplanted by the electroplating of gold over a nickel substrate, which is more economical and less dangerous.

=== Depletion ===
In depletion gilding, a subtractive process discovered in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, articles are fabricated by various techniques from an alloy of copper and gold, named tumbaga by the Spaniards. The surface is etched with acids, resulting in a surface of porous gold. The porous surface is then burnished down, resulting in a shiny gold surface. The results fooled the conquistadors into thinking they had massive quantities of pure gold. The results startled modern archaeologists, because at first the pieces resemble electroplated articles. is a special Korean technique of silver-gilding, using depletion gilding.

== Ceramics ==
The gilding of decorative ceramics has been undertaken for centuries, with the permanence and brightness of gold appealing to designers. Both porcelain and earthenware are commonly decorated with gold, and in the late 1970s it was reported that 5 tonnes of gold were used annually for the decoration of these products. Some wall tiles also have gold decoration. Application techniques include spraying, brushing, banding machines, and direct or indirect screen-printing. After application the decorated ware is fired in a kiln to fuse the gold to the glaze and hence ensure its permanence. The most important factors affecting coating quality are the composition of applied gold, the state of the surface before application, the thickness of the layer and the firing conditions.

A number of different forms and compositions are available to apply gold to ceramic, and these include:
* Acid-etched gilding: developed in 1860s at Mintons, Stoke-on-Trent, and patented in 1863. The glazed surface, usually a narrow border, is transfer printed with a wax-like resist, after which the glaze is etched with dilute hydrofluoric acid prior to application of the gold, after which the design&#x27;s raised elements are selectively burnished to give a bright and matte surface; the process demands great skill and is used for the decoration only of ware of the highest class.
* Bright gold or liquid gold is a solution of gold sulphoresinate together with other metal resinates and a bismuth-based flux. It is particularly bright when drawn from the decorating kiln and so needs little further processing. This form of gilding was invented or at least improved by Heinrich Roessler. Rhodium compounds are used to improve the binding to the substrate.
* Burnish gold or best gold is applied to the ware as a suspension of gold powder in essential oils mixed with lead borosilicate or a bismuth-based flux. This type of gold decoration is dull as taken from the kiln and requires burnishing, usually with agate, to bring out the colour. As the name suggests it is considered the highest quality of gold decoration. One solvent-free burnish gold composition was reported to consist of 10 to 40% gold powder, 2 to 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 3 to 30% an aqueous acrylate resin and 5 to 50% water.

== Tools ==
A &quot;gilder&#x27;s tip&quot; is a type of gilding brush used for transferring sheets of metal leaf to either a surface that has been prepared to accept the leaf or to a gilder&#x27;s block where the leaf is then cut with a gilder&#x27;s knife into smaller portions before being transferred to the prepared surface.

The hairs on a gilder&#x27;s tip are usually made of either blue squirrel hair or the hair of a badger (sometimes other hairs are also used, such as that of a camel) arranged in a single or double row along a flat ferrule made of wood or cardboard. In order to transfer the gold leaf, the hairs are first given a very light coating of adhesive by brushing them against a surface such as the back of the user&#x27;s hand which has been coated with a thin layer of petroleum jelly (a common misconception is that static electricity causes the gold foil to attach to the brush, but this is not so) and then laying the edge of the brush along the edge of the piece of metal foil. The jelly will cause the metal to adhere very gently to the hairs and allow the piece to be floated from the paper surface on which had previously been stored. Because the leaf is so thin, this must be done in a room with extremely still air, and the user of the tip usually does not breathe until the leaf is in place.

Once the leaf has settled, it is often burnished with polished piece of agate to achieve a high degree of brilliance.

Gilder&#x27;s tips are necessary because touching the metal leaf with the finger tips would immediately cause the leaf to lose its coherent flattened shape and crumble irretrievably into metallic dust which then cannot be used for any purpose.

<text>The West India Docks are a series of three docks, quaysides, and warehouses built to import goods from, and export goods and occasionally passengers to, the British West Indies. Located on the Isle of Dogs in London, the first dock opened in 1802. Following their commercial closure in 1980, the Canary Wharf development was built around the wet docks by narrowing some of their broadest tracts.

==History==


===Early history===
Robert Milligan (–1809) of a Scottish family, was largely responsible for the construction of the West India Docks. He was a wealthy West Indies merchant, slave trader and ship owner, who returned to London having managed his family&#x27;s Jamaica sugar plantations. Outraged at losses due to theft and delay at the extensive (continuously along the Thames for ) riverside wharves comprising the Port of London, Milligan headed a group of powerful businessmenincluding George Hibbert, the chairman of the London Society of West India Planters and Merchants who was a merchant, politician, and ship-ownerwho promoted the creation of a wet dock circled by a high wall. The group planned and built West India Docks, lobbying Parliament to allow the creation of a West India Dock Company. Milligan served as both deputy chairman and chairman of the West India Dock Company. The docks were authorised by the Port of London Improvement and City Canal Act 1799 (39 Geo. 3. c. lxix).

The docks were constructed in two phases. The two northern docks were constructed between 1800 and 1802 for the West India Dock Company to a design by leading civil engineer William Jessop (with consultant John Rennie, appointed resident engineer Ralph Walker, and with input from Thomas Morris, Liverpool&#x27;s third dock engineer), and were the first commercial wet docks in London. British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and Lord Chancellor Lord Loughborough were assisted in the foundation stone ceremony on 12 July 1800 by Milligan and Hibbert. The docks were formally opened on 27 August 1802 when the unladen was hauled in by ropes. &quot;Echo&quot;, a ship laden with cargo from the West Indies, followed. For the following 21 years all vessels in the West India trade using the Port of London were compelled to use the West India docks by a clause in the Act of Parliament that had enabled their construction.

The southern dock, the South West India Dock, later known as South Dock, was constructed in the 1860s, replacing the unprofitable City Canal, built in 1805. In 1909 the Port of London Authority (PLA) took over the West India Docks, along with the other enclosed docks from St Katharines to Tilbury.
From 1960 to 1980, trade in the docks declined to almost nothing. There were two main reasons. First, the development of the shipping container made this type of relatively small dock inefficient, and the dock-owners were slow to embrace change. Second, the manufacturing exports which had maintained the trade through the docks dwindled and moved away from the local area. The docks were closed in 1981.

===Re-development===
After the closure of the upstream enclosed docks, the area was regenerated as part of the Docklands scheme, and is now home to the developments of Canary Wharf. The early phase one buildings of Canary Wharf were built out over the water, reducing the width of the north dock and middle dock. Canary Wharf tube station was constructed within the middle dock in the 1990s. Part of the original dock building was converted for use as the Museum of London Docklands in 2003.

The Crossrail Place development was completed in May 2015 and the Canary Wharf Crossrail station below it was completed in September 2015.


==Layout==
The original docks consisted of an Import Dock of of water, later named North Dock, and an Export Dock of , later named Middle Dock. Between them, the docks had a combined capability to berth over 600 vessels. Locks and basins at either end of the Docks connected them to the river Thames. These were known as Blackwall Basin and Limehouse Basin, not to be confused with the Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock also known as Limehouse Basin. To avoid congestion, ships entered from the (eastern) Blackwall end; lighters entered from the Limehouse end to the west. A dry dock for ship repairs was constructed connecting to Blackwall Basin. Subsequently, the North London Railway&#x27;s Poplar Dock was also connected to Blackwall Basin.

The Docks&#x27; design allowed a ship arriving from the West Indies to unload in the northern dock, sail round to the southern dock and load up with export cargo in a fraction of the time it had previously taken in the heavily congested and dangerous upper reaches of the Thames. Around the Import Dock a continuous line of five-storey warehouses was constructed, designed by architect George Gwilt and his son, also named George. The Export Dock needed fewer buildings as cargo was loaded upon arrival. To protect against theft, the whole complex was surrounded by a brick wall high.

The three docks were initially separate, with the two northern docks interconnected only via the basin at each end, and South Dock connected via a series of three basins at the eastern end. Railway access was very difficult. Under PLA control, cuts were made to connect the three docks into a single system, and the connections to the Thames at the western end were filled, along with the Limehouse basin and with it the western connection between the two northern docks. This allowed improved road and rail access from the north and west. South Dock was also connected to the north end of Millwall Dock, its enlarged eastern lock becoming the only entrance from the Thames to the whole West India and Millwall system.

<doc id="390702" wikidata="Q1202897" url="?curid=390702" title="Dublin City University">
<text>Dublin City University (abbreviated as DCU) () is a university based on the Northside of Dublin, Ireland. Created as the &quot;National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin&quot; in 1975, it enrolled its first students in 1980, and was elevated to university status (along with the NIHE Limerick, now the University of Limerick) in September 1989 by statute.

In September 2016, DCU completed the process of incorporating four other Dublin-based educational institutions: the Church of Ireland College of Education, All Hallows College, Mater Dei Institute of Education and St Patrick&#x27;s College.

As of 2020, the university has 17,400 students and over 80,000 alumni. In addition, the university has around 1,200 online distance education students studying through DCU Connected. There were 1,690 staff in 2019. Notable members of the academic staff include former Taoiseach, John Bruton and &quot;thinking&quot; Guru Edward De Bono. Bruton accepted a position as Adjunct Faculty Member in the School of Law and Government in early 2004 and De Bono accepted an adjunct Professorship in the university in mid-2005.

The founding president of the institution was Dr Danny O&#x27;Hare, who retired in 1999 after 22 years&#x27; service. After a period of administration by an acting president, Professor Albert Pratt, Professor Ferdinand von Prondzynski was appointed and continued as president for a full ten-year term, which ended in July 2010. Professor Brian MacCraith was appointed next and was succeeded in 2020 by the current president, Professor Daire Keogh.

==History==

The institution was created in 1975, on an ad hoc basis, and on 18 June that year Liam Mulcahy was made acting director of the institution, and a day later the first governing body met. Danny O&#x27;Hare became director in 1977, and presided over the institution, then based at Mount Street in central Dublin, for the next 22 years. It was intended at the early stage that the institution become the unified structure under which the colleges of what later became Dublin Institute of Technology would unite, but by 1978 it became apparent that this would not be the case and instead an independent institution developed with a distinct identity and mission.

In 1979, the institution was located on an site from the city centre, just north of Dublin City Council&#x27;s Albert College Park; the &quot;Albert College Building&quot; and the neighbouring President&#x27;s Residence, are the only significant buildings remaining from before this period. The Henry Grattan building was the first new building, completed in 1981, along with the adjoining restaurant, and many buildings have been added since, to form the university campus.

In 1986 the &quot;International Study Group on Technological Education&quot; was set up to examine the future of the National Institute for Higher Education at Dublin and Limerick, and in its report stated that it should be elevated to university status, with naming:
:&quot;...the NIHE Dublin having the title Dublin City University or the University of Leinster.&quot;
Ultimately the title &quot;Dublin City University&quot; was chosen and this was confirmed by the Dublin City University Act of 1989.

The early focus of the institution was, in particular, on science and technology, although it has also had from the start a business school. It later developed a presence also in the performing arts and in the humanities. DCU is also famous for its programme of work placement or &quot;INTRA&quot; (INtegrated TRAining), which was the first such programme in Ireland.

DCU has been providing Irish and foreign adults with flexible access to higher education for over 35 years. In 1982 the National Distance Education Centre was located at DCU and for many years offered programmes in the traditional &quot;distance education&quot; mode of delivery. It changed to Oscail – DCU Online Education in 2004 to reflect the reality that its programmes were increasingly designed with large elements of online support. In 2013, DCU launched the National Institute for Digital Learning (NIDL) with the Open Education Unit as part of the new institute. This Unit manages online courses and degree programmes offered to Irish residents and students around the world through DCU Connected.

There was a plan in 2002 to base the headquarters of the Irish Academy for the Performing Arts in DCU, but this was later scrapped.

==About==


===Campuses===
The university has five campuses:
*The main campus, usually described as being in Glasnevin but adjacent to Whitehall and Ballymun too
*Sports campus (St Clare&#x27;s)
*DCU Alpha Innovation campus, Glasnevin
*St Patrick&#x27;s campus in Drumcondra
*All Hallows campus, Drumcondra

====Main campus====
The total area of the main campus is approximately and is bordered by Collins Avenue, Albert College Park, Ballymun Road, Hillside Farm and St. Aidan&#x27;s School. A further (including Elmhurst House) situated along Griffith Avenue have been acquired. Entrances to the main campus are from Ballymun Road, to the west, and Collins Avenue, to the north.

====St Clare&#x27;s (Sports) campus====
There are at the St Clare&#x27;s campus on the west side of Ballymun Road; this part of the campus also includes the Sports Pavilion.

====DCU Alpha Innovation campus====
A 10-acre site with 18,000 sq. m. of buildings, north of central Glasnevin, DCU ALPHA is home to 35 companies employing 350 staff who are developing products in connected health, clean energy and Internet of Things (IoT) technology.

====St Patrick&#x27;s campus====
The grounds, including a sports field at the rear, of the former St Patrick&#x27;s Teaching Training College in central Drumcondra, north of the River Tolka, form a distinct campus. The majority of DCU Institute of Education activities are located on this campus.

====All Hallow&#x27;s campus====
The lands and buildings of the former All Hallows College (including Drumcondra House) on Grace Park Road in residential Drumcondra form another DCU campus. This includes a burial ground. The Church of Ireland Centre, overseeing the religious elements of the fully merged former Church of Ireland College of Education (whose old site was not bought by DCU), is also based at this campus.

DCU has teaching and research facilities, including television and sound studios, computer laboratories and networking facilities, language and interpreting laboratories, a video-conferencing suite, and print and graphical laboratories. These are in addition to research and teaching laboratories in the areas of physics, chemistry, biology and engineering.

The primary arts facility is The Helix performing arts centre.

There is an InterFaith Centre located on the campus, a crèche, a medical centre, a Counselling Service, and a Disability Service. There was also a commercial VHI Swiftcare Clinic, that closed in 2011.

Other social facilities include The Venue (Student Arts Theatre, also known as omega [Ω], capacity: 1,000), a Ticketmaster outlet, a &quot;Digital Café&quot;, club and society meeting and seminar rooms, two Starbucks cafés, one at the main restaurant (the first in Ireland) and one in the Sports Building, three pool rooms, and a &quot;Glass Room&quot; for band practice.

The Centre for Talented Youth and The Helix a purpose-built performance space, which includes Ireland&#x27;s largest concert hall, the Mahony Hall, are both part of the university.

DCU also has a campus radio station called DCUfm.

An Arts Committee was established in 1983 and has since acquired more than 300 works of art, including paintings, tapestries and sculptures, for the university. The collection includes works by artists such as Louis le Brocquy, Cecil King, Patrick Scott, Michael Warren, Stephen Lawlor, Brian Bourke, Victor Sloan, Barrie Cooke and William Crozier.

===Entrepreneurship===
Dublin City University has a large number of graduate entrepreneurs and these form part of the DCU Alumni Entrepreneur Network which is run by the Alumni Office. Invent, the commercialisation gateway of DCU, is home to the Entrepreneurs&#x27; Organisation. It also hosts the Irish arm of the US-based National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), which helps young people from poorer backgrounds to build skills and unlock creativity. The DCU Ryan Academy, established during the presidency of Ferdinand von Prondzynski and funded by the family of the late entrepreneur Dr Tony Ryan, promotes entrepreneurship and innovation, delivering short courses on a wide range of topics from Social Enterprise Development to Foresight and Future Trends. As well as for-profit entrepreneurship the academy also works in the area of social entrepreneurship and social enterprise.

===Registration and application===
Most undergraduates enter DCU through the Irish Central Applications Office process. The university is also party to an agreement with the Postgraduate Applications Centre in Galway.

===Corporate identity===
The university&#x27;s current corporate identity dates from 2001 when the new president, Ferdinand von Prondzynski, decided to rebrand the identity as he considered the previous &quot;three castles&quot; logo to be out of date and not representative of the university&#x27;s vision as a modern and networked research university.

===Rankings===

The university was named &quot;Irish University of the Year 2004-2005&quot; by the Sunday Times, UK. It was also ranked second in the league table of Irish universities in the same newspaper that year, and fourth in the two subsequent league tables. The university was one of three establishments of higher education in Ireland which are ranked amongst the top 300 universities worldwide by the Times Higher Education Supplement in 2007–2008. The university was named &quot;Irish University of the Year&quot; by the Sunday Times newspaper once again for the 2010–2011 academic year.

The university has been named numerous times as one of the world&#x27;s top 50 universities that are under 50 years old, by the QS World University Rankings list. DCU&#x27;s QS World University ranking is 391st (jointly) for 2018 and it is ranked in the 51-60 bracket among universities less than 50 years old.

==Organisation==

===Governance===
In accordance with legislation, the university is directed by a policy-making statutory Governing Body, whose functions are outlined in the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, Act, 1980, amended in the Dublin City University Act, 1989 which raised the institution&#x27;s status to that of a university and provided for related matters. There are several other important acts concerning the college including the Universities Act, 1997, which allows for the creation of University Statutes.

The Governing Body&#x27;s 31 members are chosen by a wide range of groups and authorities, and include members elected by staff (in various classes) and students (ex-officio based on elections of Students Union officers). Graduates can directly elect one member and one further graduate member is put forward by the Educational Trust.

===Chancellors===
The university is headed, titularly, by the Chancellor. , the Chancellor of Dublin City University is Martin McAleese (2011-2016, 2016–2021), who was preceded by Ireland&#x27;s former EU Commissioner and Attorney General, David Byrne (2006-2011). Byrne was in turn preceded by the Hon Ms Justice Mella Carroll (2001-2006) who in turn was preceded by Dr. Tom Hardiman (-2001).

===Academic governance===
A statutory Academic Council, with three standing committees, oversees the teaching and research work of the university. The three permanent sub-committees, which replaced a single Standing Committee, are the Education Committee, the University Standards Committee and the Graduate Research Studies Board.

===Academic structure===
The academic organisation of the university is arranged into faculties and schools. DCU has recently undergone some reorganisation on the faculty level, with an incorporation process establishing one of Europe&#x27;s largest Institutes of Education. There are currently five faculties, each headed by an Executive Dean. Below this level are Schools, each with its own Head, and for each degree programme, a Programme Board, with an elected chairperson.

Since 2017, academic staff are assigned titles as Assistant Professor (formerly Lecturer), Associate Professor (formerly Senior Lecturer), Professor (formerly associate professor) and Full Professor.

DCU houses the country&#x27;s first purpose-built university nursing school.

DCU has a long history of distance education and offers a number of undergraduate, postgraduate online courses and degree programmes delivered through DCU Connected. It also hosts the National Institute for Digital Learning (NIDL), which aims to be a world leader at the forefront of designing, implementing and evaluating contemporary models of digital, blended and online learning. The NIDL also manages the design and delivery of a growing suite of free online courses (i.e., MOOCs) through Ireland&#x27;s Open Learning Academy.

DCU is also the location for all professional Actuarial exams in Ireland. It also has a Prometric Test Centre and is the test centre for Ireland&#x27;s Graduate Management Admission Test.

DCU awards degrees in Business Studies and International Finance and Marketing, Innovation and Technology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in partnership with Princess Nora bint Abdul Rahman University.

===Libraries===
DCU library is a deposit library, making it legally entitled to a copy of every book published in Ireland. It is a member of the IReL (Irish Research E-Library) consortium, allowing staff and students full access to over 100 online academic databases.

The John and Aileen O`Reilly Library building on the Glasnevin Campus opened in 2002, replacing a facility in the original NIHE building, with funding from The O&#x27;Reilly Foundation and Atlantic Philanthropies. The building was designed by Scott Tallon Walker and received the SCONUL Library Design Award. The building also hosts the university&#x27;s maths learning centre and writing centre.

The Cregan Library on the Saint Patrick&#x27;s campus opened in 2015, costing €50 million, replacing previous facilities nearby.

In November 2008, DCU Library launched DORAS, an open access institutional repository, to promote the university&#x27;s research by providing free online access to DCU&#x27;s research publications and theses.

In 2009, the library received the private papers of Charles Haughey, a former Taoiseach.

===Employment law controversies===
As with most universities, there has been some controversy and litigation over time. Controversy began over the wording and adoption of new university statutes on suspension and dismissal of staff by the Governing Authority, on the recommendation of the president, as required by the Universities Act 1997. In 2002, the Labour Court recommended that this statute be rewritten and this has been followed by long-running negotiations between the university and the trade union representing staff, SIPTU; In 2008 a vote organised by SIPTU led to a majority (of the admittedly very small number of staff who voted) declaring no confidence in the management of the university in its conduct of these negotiations.

In 2002, a Rights Commissioner recommended the reinstatement of a tenured lecturer following the university&#x27;s decision to treat his contract as having been repudiated. An appeal from the Rights Commissioner&#x27;s recommendation by the university commenced at the Employment Appeals Tribunal in July 2009 and continued in December 2009 and January 2010. During the hearing in 2009 there was significant emphasis on statements made by the lecturer in his blog throughout 2009, which were deemed by the President, Professor Ferdinand von Prondzynski, and others to be highly defamatory. In a final decision, the lecturer was refused reinstatement but given modest financial compensation.

A second case related to accusations of gender discrimination against a senior female member of academic staff, and was won by the academic on appeal at the Labour Court.

Litigation also arose following the purported termination by the university of the appointment of an associate professor in 2006, after he had indicated he was moving to another university, while refusing to confirm the timing of his move. The High Court ruled against DCU on three grounds, and the case was appealed by the university; this led to a 2009 Supreme Court hearing in December 2009, with DCU losing on procedural grounds. The president, Professor von Prondzynski, at the time deferred elections to the university Executive when it involved the candidacy of the purported dismissed academic, commenting that he could not see how the professor could become a member of the Executive advising him, but at the same time he stressed his openness to a range of views.

==DCU Educational Trust==
The university is supported by a charitable Trust, named the &quot;DCU Educational Trust&quot;, the main work of which is in fund-raising.

==Student body==
The composition of the student body represents every county on the island of Ireland and over seventy countries worldwide, spread across all six continents. The university has educated students from Australia to Brazil and Japan to Iceland. International students currently make up just over 15% of the full-time student body. The university is strongly committed to international education and internationalising its campus. Apart from a large number of exchanges the university also welcomes international students as part of its Study Abroad Programme and offers programmes jointly with institutions based outside Ireland and is rapidly expanding a wide range of international activities.

==Student activities==
===Clubs and societies===
There are more than 140 clubs and societies representing a wide range of interests such as culture, computer games, sport, and academic interests.

===Governing Committees===

The Society Life Committee (SLC) and The Club Life Committee (CLC) govern and drive policy and funding for societies and clubs at DCU. Student facilities for societies are mostly based in the Student Centre, The U, which was opened in September 2018.

===Drama===
DCU&#x27;s Drama Society hosts many productions for the public every year, including its annual flagship event, the DCU Musical. In 2009, the musical &quot;Rent&quot;, was nominated for the Best Overall Show award, and the Best Director award with the Association of Irish Musical Societies. DCU Drama reprised RENT at Dublin&#x27;s Olympia Theatre. from 15 to 20 June 2009. DCU Drama also sends plays to be adjudicated for the Irish Student Drama Association awards. DCU Drama won the Best National College Society award at the Board of Irish College Societies awards in 2002, 2003 and 2008, and was nominated for Best Society Event nationwide for &quot;The Full Monty&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Rent&quot; in 2009. DCU Drama won Best Society at DCU in 2017 and most recently performed the musical &quot;Sweeney Tod&quot;d in Spring of 2018.

===Music===
As one of DCU&#x27;s biggest and most active societies, Music Society organises lessons, workshops, concerts, open mic nights, trips to concerts, weekends away, an intervarsity Battle of the Bands and a myriad of other events every year. The Battle of the Bands is its main event, with participants coming from colleges nationwide. The 2010 Battle of the Bands took place on 29 March in DCU. Music Society won the award for Best Society in DCU in 2007.

===Politics===

Ireland&#x27;s major political parties are represented on campus. In the 2012–2013 academic year, the Fianna Fáil party was the largest political party on campus and was chaired by Ruadhrí Moran. The Labour Party, who were traditionally the largest on-campus, have fallen into second place, with the Fine Gael party, chaired by Ryan Hunt in third with a drop in 30% of membership.

==Strategy==
Shortly after the appointment in 2000 of the then-new president, Ferdinand von Prondzynski, DCU adopted what was described as a highly innovative strategic plan, &#x27;Leading Change&#x27;. For a university strategy, it was a very short document, but it set out a number of major developments and innovations. Chief amongst these was the adoption of academic strategic &#x27;Themes&#x27;, which were to govern the development of the university. Each Theme was to have a &#x27;Theme Leader&#x27;. The academic Themes are interdisciplinary and focus on areas in which DCU has growing leadership. This strategic framework was extended in the 2005 strategic plan, &#x27;Leadership through Foresight&#x27;, in which DCU also committed itself to eight key clusters of actions to develop its leading role in its chosen priority areas. Following an announcement by the HEA in August 2007, DCU received over €23m in research funding under Phase 2 of PRTLI Cycle 4.

Following an announcement by the Science Foundation Ireland in November 2007, DCU received over €16.8m in research funding for localisation research for a €30.4m &quot;Next Generation Localisation&quot; project headed by Prof. Josef Van Genabith (with international and domestic industry partners contributing the remaining €13.6m).

==Research==
Coordinated by the Office of the Vice President for Research, there are three constituent units which support the research of academics, research students and collaborative partners: Research Support Services, Graduate School, and DCU.

<text>The Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart, the fifth-largest cathedral in North America, is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark. Headed by Cardinal Tobin for the archdiocese, it is located in the Lower Broadway neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey. Catholic mass is offered daily and three times on Sunday in English and in Spanish.

==Background==

The building, facing Branch Brook Park, is generally regarded as the &quot;most perfect and exact example of French Gothic architecture in the Western Hemisphere.&quot;
Construction began in 1899 and was finished in 1954. The original design called for an English-Irish Gothic Revival church, but plans were later modified in favor of a French Gothic Revival style.

Many art historians consider the cathedral&#x27;s stained glass to be the second finest in the world, after the Chartres Cathedral. Large circular rose windows of stained glass by the Zettler studio adorn the structure. The 36-foot rose window over the primary entrance is the largest such window in the Catholic Church in the Western Hemisphere.

The building is roughly the size of Westminster Abbey, with towers higher than those of that structure as well as those of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame.

It is home to the largest pipe organ ever built by the Schantz Organ Company, also the largest church organ in New Jersey.
The cathedral basilica encloses a variety of chapels honoring saints representing different ethnic Catholic groups who live in the Newark area and helped build the cathedral.

The structure is named for the Catholic devotion to what is known as the Sacred Heart of Jesus, considered by followers of that religion to be a symbolic reference to Jesus Christ&#x27;s love and compassion for humanity.

==Music, religious customs and traditions==
===Music at the Cathedral Basilica===

The free concert series at the cathedral basilica, open to the public, is in its 55th season as of 2023–24.

The pipe organ, the largest Schantz ever built, includes 154 stops playable from two consoles. When installed in 1953, the organ held 144 stops; it was expanded and renovated in 1989.

Performances of religious music at the cathedral basilica also include the New Jersey Symphony&#x27;s annual Advent season performance of Handel&#x27;s&quot; Messiah&quot; (a ticketed event).

===Holy Week===

The cathedral basilica is home to a number of special religious events during Holy Week, including a Palm Sunday mass, Chrism Mass, and services on Holy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Vigil in anticipation of Easter Sunday.

===Black History Month Mass===
The cathedral typically celebrates Black history with an annual mass in which the cathedral basilica is decorated with images of Black Catholic candidates for sainthood and participants frequently wear African, African-American and Caribbean cultural attire.

===Hispanic Heritage Mass===

The church celebrates Hispanic heritage with an annual mass, featuring Spanish-language music, and participants often wear cultural dress to represent their nations of origin.

=== Golden Anniversary Mass ===
Each spring, frequently during the cherry blossom season at Branch Brook Park across from the cathedral basilica, Cardinal Tobin holds a mass to honor and bless local couples celebrating 50 years of marriage.

=== Blue Mass ===
The cathedral basilica hosts the Blue Mass annually to honor the dedication and sacrifices of fallen, active, and retired New Jersey law enforcement personnel. Numerous dignitaries typically attend, including Governor Phil Murphy, Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin and others.

===Red Mass===
A red mass is held annually for members of the legal profession and government officials.

==Visit by Pope John Paul II and cathedral&#x27;s elevation to basilica==

During Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to the United States in 1995, he celebrated evening prayer at the cathedral. At this occasion, the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart was elevated to a minor basilica to become the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart.

==Twenty-first century events==
In 2017, Cardinal Tobin welcomed a pilgrimage of LGBTQ Catholics to the cathedral basilica.

==Additional history==

===Planning for the church===
The Cathedral of the Sacred Heart was proposed in 1859 by James Roosevelt Bayley, the Bishop of Newark, just six years after his appointment by Pope Pius IX. In 1870, Bishop Bailey sent architect Jeremiah O&#x27;Rourke and Monsignor George Hobart Doane to Europe to view various cathedrals.

Proposed sites included a corner at High and Kinney Streets and an alternate at South and Broad Streets. However, the current site, next to Branch Brook Park in the Forest Hill section of Newark&#x27;s North Ward, was chosen. Bayley waited to buy the land until the site was recommended by O&#x27;Rourke, the architect of the planned cathedral; and Monsignor Doane. Doane liked the current site because it &quot;commands a view of the Orange Mountains on the west and the Newark Valley, the hills of Staten Island, and New York on the east.&quot; The property purchase was completed January 2, 1871, for US$60,000.

In 1872, Bayley was elevated to Archbishop of Baltimore and the project was handed over to the new bishop, Michael Corrigan. Corrigan ordered the excavation of the site in 1875 and 1876. In 1881, the project was handed over to yet another new bishop, Winand Wigger.
The City of Newark wanted to buy the site for the new Newark High School in 1896 but was rejected by Wigger. As the plans moved on, Wigger erected a temporary church under the same name on February 15, 1889. In July 1897, a fundraiser was started to build the cathedral. O&#x27;Rourke was chosen to design an English-Irish gothic design. In accepting the commission, O&#x27;Rourke pledged to Wigger that the work would be &quot;a labor of love and not of fees and profits.&quot;

===Construction===

====Early stages====
Following groundbreaking in January 1898, the cornerstone was laid on June 11, 1899. O&#x27;Rourke wanted to get the walls and towers built first and selected a Vermont Rockport granite as the exterior stone. By 1902, the walls then stood 50 feet at the nave and ambulatory, with the first four tiers of the front towers under construction. Wigger died on January 5, 1901, and the new bishop, John Joseph O&#x27;Connor, asked O&#x27;Rourke to cut costs not to exceed a price tag of US$1 million.

====Halt in construction====
O&#x27;Rourke was removed as head architect in 1910 following a series of feuds between O&#x27;Rourke and another architect. The new architect, Mr. Waldron noticed a dangerous shift in weight and hired Fred Metcalf to observe this shift. An order went out to remove all 24 pillars, excavate underneath, re-level the ground and reset 22 pillars. The decision to eliminate two pillars allowed the builders to eliminate the clerestory wall connecting the nave and the chancel, widening the transept to . As the arches and clerestory began to rise in the latter half of 1910, architects provided extra reinforcement in the form of steel girders at the clerestory level down either side of the nave and around the ambulatory.

====Design changes====
The original English/Irish-gothic style was switched to a French-gothic one with those plans accepted in June 1913 and work starting in August 1913. Changes included:

* reducing the height of the towers from to ;
* eliminating the spires to reduce the weight loads on the tower;
* eliminating the exterior nave buttresses and pinnacles,;
* substituting three rose windows instead of a concentric-circle design; and
* increasing use of sculptures at the entrances.

====The last stage====
By 1918, construction moved at a steady pace to allow the completion of the steel-slated roof in November 1919; by the roofing company Conrad &amp; Baier. The granite tympanum canopies and medallions were finished and, by July 1924, the windows were completed. With this, the building was finally insulated for the first time since the construction&#x27;s start. The carving of the medallions&#x27; scriptural scenes and bishops&#x27; portraits took place on-site between April 1922 and November 1924 under the direction of Rochette and Parzini of New York City.

In 1925, officials wanted the cathedral completed by December 1926, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s ordination as a priest. The dedication was postponed because of a dispute over the type of limestone used and the many delays in construction. Limestone installation, vaulting, the work on the sanctuary floor and sacristies continued.

With O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death in May 1927, construction focus shifted to the crypt where he would be laid to rest.

General work re-commenced in August 1927 and ended some months later with the installation of an Italian Botticino-marble altar purchased from Benziger Brothers of New York City.

====Pre-dedication====

The new bishop, Thomas Joseph Walsh, opened the cathedral even though construction was ongoing. Walsh believed it was time for the cathedral to be open even though it was unfinished.

The first ordination was his own as Bishop of Newark on May 1, 1928. A Pontifical Mass followed, celebrated by Father Joseph H. Conroy, with a crowd of nearly 4,000 people.

Walsh&#x27;s elevation to Archbishop of Newark took place on April 27, 1938. He celebrated his Silver Jubilee on July 29, 1943, and the 50th anniversary of his ordination as a priest on May 1, 1950.

During the pre-dedication, Walsh ordained six bishops in the cathedral.

====Dedication====
After nearly 95 years of planning and building, Thomas Aloysius Boland, Archbishop of Newark, finally dedicated the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart on October 19, 1954. During the ceremony, Boland received the pallium from then-Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, Apostolic Nuncio (delegate) to the United States.

====Post-dedication====
The Father Monsignor Joseph A. Doyle, who spent his entire priestly life in the cathedral parish, was appointed first rector.

In addition to the six bishops he ordained during the pre-dedication, Boland ordained many priests in this cathedral and showed people&#x27;s contributions in this church.

Thousands came to celebrate his Golden Jubilee in 1972. In 1974, Pope Paul VI named as Boland&#x27;s successor Peter Leo Gerety from Portland, Maine.

<doc id="390705" wikidata="Q2421489" url="?curid=390705" title="The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot; is one of 12 Sherlock Holmes short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle in &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1927). It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in October 1921, and was also published in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; in the United States in November 1921.

== Plot ==
Watson arrives in 221B Baker Street where the page boy Billy shows him a wax effigy of Holmes placed near a curtained window in the sitting room. The effigy produces a shadow on the curtain that, when viewed from outside, is the unmistakable profile of Sherlock Holmes. Using this visual trick, Holmes aims to give a perfect target to a would-be murderer with a rifle. Holmes names his murderer as Count Negretto Sylvius, the diamond thief he has been following in disguise. He gives the criminal&#x27;s address to Watson, then sends the doctor out the back for the police. As the Count arrives, Holmes has Billy invite him inside, then takes him by surprise when he attempts an assault on the effigy. Holmes then offers the Count and his helper, boxer Sam Merton, freedom if they give up the jewel, or jail if not.

He invites them to discuss the deal while he plays violin in the next room. When the Count decides to double-cross Holmes and takes the stone from his secret pocket to show Sam in window light, the detective springs from the chair in place of his replica and grabs the £100K jewel. His bedroom has a gramophone and secret passage to behind the curtain.

After the police take away the villains, Lord Cantlemere sweeps in. Unlike the Prime Minister and Home Secretary, he did not want Holmes. When tricked into insisting on arrest for whoever is found possessing the diamond, he finds the jewel in his pocket – where Holmes has placed it – and apologizes. Finally, Holmes can eat.

== Analysis ==
It is notable for being one of only two Arthur Conan Doyle Holmes stories, aside from a couple of humorous vignettes, to be written in third person. The other is &quot;His Last Bow&quot;. &quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot; was written this way because it was adapted from a stage play, &quot;The Crown Diamond&quot;, in which Watson hardly appeared. Its adaptation from the theatre also explains why the action in this story is confined to one room. The plot twist in which Holmes reveals he had been listening to the two criminals as they spoke freely would also not have been possible using a first person narrative.

&quot;The Crown Diamond&quot;, subtitled &quot;An Evening with Sherlock Holmes&quot;, was first performed on 2 May 1921 at the Bristol Hippodrome, and was written before the short story, which was first published in October 1921. However, historians do not agree on when the play was written, with some believing it was penned in early 1921 while others believe it was written years earlier. In the original play, the villain was Holmes&#x27;s enemy Colonel Sebastian Moran of &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; infamy, not Count Negretto Sylvius.

According to Leslie S. Klinger, the name used to describe the &quot;Mazarin stone&quot; in the short story implies the stone once belonged to Cardinal Jules Mazarin, who, upon his death in 1661, bequeathed to the French monarch a collection of eighteen diamonds thereafter called the &quot;Mazarin Diamonds&quot;. The name &quot;Mazarin&quot; is not mentioned in the original play, though the stone is described as a yellow Crown diamond in both the play and the short story.

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in October 1921, and in the US in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; in November 1921. The story was published with three illustrations by Alfred Gilbert in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with four illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film and television ===
A short silent film based on the story was released in 1923 as part of the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures, with Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson.

An episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;For the Children&quot; adapted the story for television in 1951. Featuring Andrew Osborn as Holmes and Philip King as Watson, no footage is believed to have survived.

This story was heavily rewritten for Granada Television&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes series. In 1994, it was merged with another story, &quot;The Adventure of the Three Garridebs&quot;. The most noticeable change is that Holmes does not feature except in the prologue and final scene (actor Jeremy Brett was away due to illness). It is Mycroft Holmes (Charles Gray) who takes up the case of the stolen diamond, while Watson is retained to look into the Garrideb mystery.

&quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot; was adapted as &quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Chip&quot; for a 2001 episode of the animated television show &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot;.

=== Radio ===
&quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot; was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 9 February 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another dramatisation of the story adapted by Meiser aired on 23 May 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as episodes of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired on 5 January 1941 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson) and 4 January 1948 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).

Two BBC radio adaptations of the story aired as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson. The first aired on 2 December 1954 on the BBC Home Service and was dramatised by Felix Felton, with Ralph Truman as Count Negretto Sylvius. The second aired on 4 September 1962 on the BBC Light Programme, and was dramatised by Michael Hardwick, with Francis de Wolff as Count Sylvius.

&quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Anthony Bate as Lord Cantlemere and Nigel Anthony as Count Sylvius.

In 2006, the story was adapted for radio as part of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

<doc id="390713" wikidata="Q8025569" url="?curid=390713" title="Winnemac (fictional U.S. state)">
<text>Winnemac is a fictional U.S. state invented by the writer Sinclair Lewis. His novel &quot;Babbitt&quot; takes place in Zenith, its largest city (population 361,000, according to a sketch-map Lewis made to guide his writing). Winnemac is also a setting for &quot;Gideon Planish&quot;, &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;, &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, and &quot;Dodsworth&quot;.

==Description==

Lewis turned to the creation of a fictional locale after residents of Sauk Centre, Minnesota, were upset with the town&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Main Street&quot;. In one of the essays in &quot;Sinclair Lewis: A Collection of Critical Essays&quot; Mark Schorer describes &quot;the state of Winnemac&quot; as &quot;more typical than any real state in the Union&quot;. In &quot;The Last of the Provincials: The American Novel, 1915–1925&quot; critic H. L. Mencken sees Winnemac as exemplifying the &quot;standardized chain-store state&quot; of the midwest. In his critical study of Sinclair Lewis, Sheldon Grebstein notes that the &quot;average mid-western state called Winnemac&quot; is an amalgamation of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan.

According to Helen Batchelor, following the breakthrough success of &quot;Main Street&quot;, Lewis conceived an ambitious plan for a series of interrelated novels that required a common fictional locale. Reviewing Lewis&#x27;s last novel and his literary career, Malcolm Cowley says: 

[Lewis] didn&#x27;t write easy books after &quot;Main Street&quot;. He laid out for himself an extensive plan of work: he would invent the state of Winnemac, more typical than any real state in the Union, and in one book after another would describe the representative activities of its inhabitants, until he had completed a wide survey of American society.

In &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;, Lewis describes Winnemac thus:

Other novels mention that its capital is Galop de Vache, its river is the Chaloosa, and its important cities are Monarch, Sparta, Pioneer, Catawba, and Eureka. Lewis&#x27; novel Work of Art mentions the city of Golden Glow as &#x27;the dirtiest and noisiest industrial huddle&#x27; in Winnemac.

==Lewis&#x27;s map of Winnemac==
According to Batchelor, in 1921, Lewis&#x27;s wife wrote to a friend that Lewis had made &quot;the most astonishingly complete set of maps of Zenith, so that the city, the suburbs, the state&quot; were clear in his mind. John S. Mayfield of Syracuse University discovered the maps in Lewis&#x27;s Vermont study in 1961. One map was entitled &quot;The State in which is Zenith.&quot; Batchelor called it &quot;the most exciting&quot; and said that it was &quot;of greater imaginative importance than the city [because it] provides in a greater way than Zenith the interrelatedness among these works.&quot; In 1934, an earlier commentator, George Annand, had deduced and published a &quot;Map of Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s United States,&quot; but the discovery of Lewis&#x27;s own map showed significant differences. Winnemac &quot;is much further north than had previously been thought... New York City is decidedly southeast of Zenith... Lake Michigan is simply ignored by Lewis in creating the state.&quot; Lewis&#x27;s map places Zenith due east of Chicago and 17½ miles from the Illinois border. Besides those mentioned above, cities and towns on the map include Minnemegantic, Banjo Crossing, Roysburg, Tuttleville, Vulcan, Hamburg, New Paris, St. Ruan, Babylon, Chestnut Grove, Parkinton, Eureka, Aetna, Madrid, St. Agatha, and (of course) a Springfield.

<text>Mingrelia or Samegrelo (; ) is a historic province in the western part of Georgia, formerly known as [[Odishi]]. It is primarily inhabited by the Mingrelians, a subgroup of Georgians.

==Geography and climate==
Mingrelia is bordered by the secessionist region of Abkhazia to the north-west, Svaneti to the north, Imereti to the east, Guria to the south and the Black Sea to the west.

Administratively, the historic province of Mingrelia is incorporated joined with the northern part of the neighboring mountainous province of Svaneti to form the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region, the capital of which is Mingrelia&#x27;s main city, Zugdidi.

As it is the case with most Black Sea coastal areas of Georgia, Mingrelia&#x27;s climate is subtropical with frequent rains. The coastal areas have many marshlands despite the Soviet Georgian authorities&#x27; efforts to dry them up. These marshlands contain many rare birds and animals not found in other parts of the country. For this reason, substantial part of the territories is protected by the Georgian law as part of the Colchetian Nature Reserve.

==History==

In ancient times Mingrelia was a major part of the kingdom of Colchis (9th-6th centuries BC) and its successor Egrisi (4th century BC-6th century AD). In the 11th-15th centuries, Mingrelia was a part of the united Kingdom of Georgia. From the 16th century to 1857, the independent Kingdom of Mingrelia was under the rule of the House of Dadiani. Between 1568 and 1803, it was vassal of Ottoman Empire.

In December 1803, the kingdom came under the patronage of the Russian Empire by an agreement between the Tsar and the Megrelian Prince Grigol Dadiani. The last adult Prince, David Dadiani, died in 1853, leaving his wife Ekaterine as regent for his young son, Niko. However, in 1867, the principality was abolished and absorbed into the Tsarist Russian Empire. Prince Niko Dadiani officially renounced his rights to the throne in 1868.

Plant specimens of &quot;Astrantia colchica&quot; were found on Mt. Kwira in Mingrelia in 1894 by the Russian botanist Nikolai Albov.

From 1918 to 1921, Mingrelia was part of the Democratic Republic of Georgia (DRG). In 1921, Georgia was Sovietized and later became part of the Soviet Union, as the Georgian SSR. On 9 April 1991, independence was restored to Georgia, of which Mingrelia is now part.

The first President of the post-Soviet Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, was a Megrelian. After the violent coup d&#x27;etat of 21 December 1991 – 6 January 1992, Mingrelia became the centre of a civil war, which ended with the defeat of Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s Megrelian supporters. Even so, this region was unmanageable by the central government throughout the presidency of Eduard Shevardnadze (1992–2003). The fact that the Georgian refugees from the Abkhazian war zone (who are considered by Georgians as victims of ethnic cleansing) are mostly Mingrelians has contributed to the region&#x27;s instability. In 2004, following the Rose Revolution of November 2003, newly elected Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili, who vowed to resolve the conflict with the breakaway region of Abkhazia, disarmed groups of Megrelians who tried to fight a guerrilla war against the Abkhazians by incursions from Mingrelia.

<text>SpeakEasy was a United States military project to use software-defined radio technology to make it possible to communicate with over 10 different types of military radios from a single system.

==History==

&quot;The SpectrumWare project applied a software-oriented wireless communications approach with distributed signal processing. The research direction of the SpectrumWare project was heavily influenced by two software radio efforts: the military SpeakEasy project and the commercial products of the Steinbrecher Corporation.

According to Upmal and Lackey in “SPEAKeasy, the Military Software Radio” IEEE Communications Magazine (NY: IEEE Press) 1995, the SpeakEasy project was started in 1991 and was the first large-scale software radio. SpeakEasy was motivated in large part by the communications interoperability problems that resulted from different branches of the military services having dissimilar (non-interoperable) radio systems. This lack of communications interoperability can be directly linked to casualties in several conflicts. SpeakEasy had a very aggressive goal of implementing ten different radio waveforms in software on a single platform. The designers chose the fastest DSP available at the time, the Texas Instruments TMS320C40 processor, which ran at 40 MHz. Since this was not enough processing power to implement all of the waveform processing, the system boards were designed to each support four ’C40s as well as some FPGAs.

In 1994, Phase I was successfully demonstrated; however it involved several hundred processors and filled the back of a truck. Moore’s Law provides a doubling in speed every eighteen months, and since it had taken three years to build the system and write all of the software, two doublings had taken place. This seemed to indicate that the number of processors could be reduced by a factor of four. However, SpeakEasy could not take advantage of these newer faster processors, and the reason was the software.

The software was tied to ’C40 assembly language, plus all of the specialized glue code to get four C40s to work together with the code for the particular chosen FPGA. The observation was that it had taken three years to write software for a platform that Moore’s Law made obsolete in eighteen months. Further-more, a software radio pushes most of the complexity of the radio into software, so the software development could easily become the largest, most expensive part of the system. These observations led to software portability being a key goal of the SpectrumWare project.&quot;

<doc id="390729" wikidata="Q155871" url="?curid=390729" title="Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach">
<text>Gustav Georg Friedrich Maria Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach (born Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach; 7 August 1870 – 16 January 1950) was a German foreign service official who became chairman of the board of Friedrich Krupp AG, a heavy industry conglomerate, after his marriage to Bertha Krupp, who had inherited the company. He and his son Alfried would lead the company through two world wars, producing almost everything for the German war machine from U-boats, battleships, howitzers, trains, railway guns, machine guns, cars, tanks, and much more. Krupp produced the Tiger I tank, Big Bertha and the Paris Gun, among other inventions, under Gustav. Following World War II, plans to prosecute him as a war criminal at the 1945 Nuremberg Trials were dropped because by then he was bedridden, senile, and considered medically unfit for trial. The charges against him were held in abeyance in case he were found fit for trial.

==Early life==

Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach was born 7 August 1870 in The Hague, Netherlands, to American-born Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach, and Sophie (née Bohlen). His paternal grandfather, Arnold Halbach, served as Prussian consul in Philadelphia from 1828 to 1838.

He was a grandson of Henry Bohlen and related to Charles E. Bohlen and Karoline of Wartensleben on his mother&#x27;s side.

He married Bertha Krupp in October 1906. Bertha had inherited her family&#x27;s company in 1902 at age 16 after the death of her father, Friedrich Alfred Krupp. German Emperor Kaiser William II personally led a search for a suitable spouse for Bertha, as the Krupp empire could not be headed by a woman. Gustav was picked from his previous post at the Vatican. The Kaiser announced at the wedding that Gustav would be allowed to add the Krupp name to his own. Gustav became company chairman in 1909.

After 1910, the Krupp company became a member and major funder of the Pan-German League (Alldeutscher Verband) which mobilised popular support in favour of two army bills, in 1912 and 1913, to raise Germany&#x27;s standing army to 738,000 men.

==World War I==

By World War I, the company had a near monopoly in heavy arms manufacture in Germany. At the start of the war, the company lost access to most of its overseas markets, but this was more than offset by increased demand for weapons by Germany and her allies (Central Powers). In 1902, before Krupp&#x27;s marriage, the company leased a fuse patent to Vickers Limited of the United Kingdom. Among the company&#x27;s products was a 94-ton howitzer named Big Bertha, after Krupp&#x27;s wife, and the Paris Gun. Gustav also won the lucrative contract for Germany&#x27;s U-boats, which were built at the family&#x27;s shipyard in Kiel. Krupp&#x27;s estate, the Villa Hügel, had a suite of rooms for Wilhelm II whenever he came to visit.

==Interwar years==

During the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, the directorate of the Krupp works ordered its employees to cease work, in line with the German policy of passive resistance to the occupation. A French military court sentenced Gustav Krupp to 15 years forced labour, though he was released on parole after six months once the German government abandoned its passive resistance strategy.

The Versailles Treaty prevented Germany from making armaments and submarines, forcing Krupp to significantly reduce his labour force. His company diversified to agricultural equipment, vehicles and consumer goods. However, using the profits from the Vickers patent deal and subsidies from the Weimar government, Krupp secretly began the rearming of Germany with the ink barely dry on the treaty of Versailles. It secretly continued to work on artillery through subsidiaries in Sweden, and built submarine pens in the Netherlands. In the 1930s, it restarted manufacture of tanks such as the Tiger I and other war materials, again using foreign subsidiaries.

Krupp was a member of the Prussian State Council from 1921 to 1933. Krupp was an avowed monarchist, but his first loyalty was to whoever held power. He once left a business meeting in disgust when another industrialist, who was the one hosting the meeting, referred to the late President Friedrich Ebert as &quot;that saddlemaker&quot; &quot;(Der Sattelhersteller)&quot;.

Krupp initially opposed the Nazis, yet, after Hitler became chancellor of Germany, at the secret meeting with Adolf Hitler and leading German industrialists on February 20, 1933, he contributed one million Reichsmark to the Nazi party&#x27;s fund for the March 1933 election, which enabled Hitler to take control of the government. After Hitler won power, Krupp became, as Fritz Thyssen later put it, &quot;a super Nazi&quot;, and contributed to the Adolf Hitler Fund of German Trade and Industry which was established in June 1933 to support the NSDAP. As president of the &quot;Reichsverband&quot; of German industry he led the effort to expel its Jewish members.

Like many German nationalists, Krupp believed that the Nazis could be used to end the Republic, and then be pushed aside to restore the Kaiser and the old elites. When all parties were abolished and civil liberties suspended following the Reichstag fire and Hitler&#x27;s grab for absolute power, Krupp found that he and the rest of the old elites were in the grip of the Party; the movement they had hoped to ride back into power upon had instead ridden them. Always flexible, Krupp cooperated with the new dictatorship. 

Hitler had tried to gain entry to the Krupp factories in 1929, but was rebuffed because Krupp felt he would see some of the secret armament work there and reveal it to the world. Bertha Krupp never liked Hitler even though she never complained when the company&#x27;s bottom line rose through the armaments contracts and production. She referred to him as &quot;that certain gentleman&quot; &quot;(Dieser gewisse Herr)&quot; and pleaded illness when Hitler came on an official tour in 1934. Her daughter Irmgard acted as hostess.

==World War II==

Krupp suffered failing health from 1939 onwards, and a stroke left him partially paralysed in 1941. He became a figurehead until he formally handed over the running of the business to his son Alfried in 1943. Krupp industries, under both his leadership and later that of his son, was offered facilities in eastern Europe and made extensive use of forced labor during the war.

On 25 July 1943 the Royal Air Force attacked the Krupp Works with 627 heavy bombers, dropping 2,032 long tons of bombs in an Oboe-marked attack. Upon his arrival at the works the next morning, Krupp suffered a fit from which he never recovered.

==Nuremberg Trials==

Following the Allied victory, plans to prosecute Gustav Krupp as a war criminal at the 1945 Nuremberg Trials were dropped because by then he was bedridden and senile. Despite his personal absence from the prisoners&#x27; dock, however, Krupp remained technically still under indictment and liable to prosecution in subsequent proceedings.

==Death==

Krupp died at his residence near Werfen, Salzburg in Austria on 16 January 1950. His widow died in 1957. He had eight children including Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach (1907–1967), the last owner of Krupp (succeeded by his Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation). His grandson Eckbert Georg Klaus von Bohlen und Halbach (born 1956) married Princess Désirée of Hohenzollern (born 1963), daughter of Princess Birgitta of Sweden and Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern.

<text>Douglas Rodger Naylor (born 31 December 1955) is an English comedy writer, science fiction writer, director and television producer.

==Life and career==
Naylor was born in Manchester, Lancashire, England, and studied at Chetham&#x27;s School of Music and the University of Liverpool. In the mid-1980s, Naylor created and wrote two comedy sketch shows for BBC Radio 4 entitled &quot;Cliché&quot; and &quot;Son of Cliché&quot;, as well as two sitcoms, &quot;Wrinkles&quot; and &quot;Wally Who?&quot; for the same station. These shows were scripted by Naylor along with another writer, Rob Grant. This writing partnership was successful, with Grant and Naylor going on to co-write and produce numerous British radio and television series throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including programmes such as &quot;The Cannon and Ball Show&quot;, &quot;A Kick Up The Eighties&quot;, &quot;Three of A Kind&quot;, &quot;Comic Relief&quot;, &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and they wrote the singles, &quot;Father Christmas is on the Dole&quot;, which charted in 1986 and &quot;The Chicken Song&quot; which was No. 1 in the charts for three weeks (1986). They created the sitcom&quot;The 10 Percenters&quot;, which was awarded &quot;Best ITV Sitcom&quot; at the 1996 British Comedy Awards for the second series after Grant had left the partnership.

The collaborations between Grant and Naylor have often used the pseudonym Grant Naylor. Together, they wrote the British science fiction comedy television series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; under this name. Their earlier radio sketch shows formed the basis for the show; Chris Barrie starred in both of these, as well as &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

In 1994, an episode of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; from the sixth series, &quot;Gunmen of the Apocalypse&quot;, won an International Emmy Award in the Popular Arts category, and in the same year the series was also awarded &#x27;Best BBC Comedy Series&#x27; at the British Comedy Awards. The series attracted its highest ratings, of over eight million viewers, during the eighth series in 1999.

Some time between the airing of the sixth series of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in 1993, and the writing of the seventh series in 1996, Grant ended his partnership with Naylor after revealing he was tired of it and that he intended to quit and pursue other projects. The pair announced their professional split and cited creative and professional differences, along with Grant&#x27;s desire to move into new areas.

With this split, it appeared as though &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; was finished; other obstacles included the fact that Chris Barrie was tied up starring in &quot;The Brittas Empire&quot; and the other star of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, Craig Charles, was in prison awaiting trial. However, when Charles was acquitted and Barrie became available for a few episodes, a seventh series finally went ahead. Naylor went on to write the seventh and eighth series of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; mostly on his own (70% of the series, by his own estimate), although some episodes were co-written with Paul Alexander and Kim Fuller, and one episode co-written with one of the cast members, Robert Llewellyn.

Naylor is the author of the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; novel &quot;Last Human&quot; (1995). He also wrote &quot;Primordial Soup&quot; (1993), &quot;Son of Soup&quot; (1996) and &quot;Red Dwarf VII: The Official Book&quot; (1999).

In 2007, Naylor and Grant Naylor Productions were primarily focused on the production of the DVD releases of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and the postulated movie. In 2008, it was announced by Grant Naylor Productions that &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; would return to television in the form of four half-hour specials for the UKTV Network channel Dave. The episodes were broadcast over the Easter weekend of 2009, and comprising a three-part special (20 minutes each), &quot;Back to Earth&quot;, and a behind-the-scenes making of special. Naylor wrote the scripts for the three new episodes and also directed them. &quot;Back to Earth&quot; received record ratings for the Dave channel.

In 2011, Dave commissioned Naylor to write and direct a new six episode series of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, later entitled &quot;Red Dwarf XI&quot;. The series won the Royal Television Society&#x27;s award for Best Special Effects, presented in 2013.

Naylor formed Three Feet Productions in October 2017 with his son Richard and wrote and directed a one-off comedy for BBC One, entitled &quot;Over To Bill&quot;, starring Hugh Dennis, Neil Morrissey, Tracy Ann Oberman and Helen George and produced by Richard Naylor.

In 20152016, Naylor wrote and directed 12 more episodes of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; for Dave. &quot;Red Dwarf XI&quot; was broadcast from September 2016 onwards, and &quot;Red Dwarf XII&quot; from September 2017. Both series were a Baby Cow Productions commission, with Richard Naylor and Kerry Waddell as producers. 

In 2020, &quot;Red Dwarf: The Promised Land&quot;, a 90 minute TV special, was again written and directed by Naylor for Dave and was a Baby Cow production, with Richard Naylor as producer. Naylor has now written or co-written all 74 episodes of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and was executive producer on 51 episodes.

==Personal life==
Naylor is married with two sons, one of whom (Richard) is a television writer and producer, the other a doctor. Naylor has a prosthetic leg due to a road accident when he was seven years old, hence the naming of his and Richard&#x27;s production company Three Feet Productions.

<text>Robert Grant is an English comedy writer, television producer and co-creator of the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; comedy franchise. Since &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, Grant has written two television series, &quot;The Strangerers&quot; and &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, and four solo novels, his most recent being &quot;Fat&quot;. During his career Grant has been involved in two distinct writing partnerships: the first with Doug Naylor, and the second and most recent with Andrew Marshall.

==Early life==
Grant was born in Salford and studied Psychology at Liverpool University for two years.

==Career==
In the mid-1980s, Grant collaborated with co-writer Doug Naylor on radio programmes such as &quot;Son Of Cliché&quot;, &quot;Wrinkles&quot; for Radio 4 and television programmes such as &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, &quot;The 10 Percenters&quot;, and various projects for Jasper Carrott.

The &#x27;Grant Naylor&#x27; collaboration, as it had become known, created the cult science-fiction comedy series, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, which evolved from &quot;Dave Hollins: Space Cadet&quot;, a recurring sketch within &quot;Son Of Cliché&quot;. Grant was briefly seen (uncredited) in an episode of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; entitled &quot;Backwards&quot; (1989), as a man who &#x27;un-smoked&#x27; a cigarette. In the mid-1990s, the &#x27;Grant Naylor&#x27; collaboration was ended when Grant left &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; after the sixth series, citing creative differences (&quot;... it was basically &#x27;musical differences&#x27; ...&quot;) with Doug Naylor. His main reason however, he said, was that he &quot;wished to have more on his &#x27;tombstone&#x27; than &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; on its own&quot;.

In 2018, Grant collaborated with Andrew Marshall to produce, direct and write the BBC Radio 4 Series, &quot;The Quanderhorn Xperimentations&quot; - and also the novel version published by Gollancz Publishers.

In 2021, it was announced that Grant had written a short Red Dwarf script, &quot;Into the Gloop&quot;, which was performed live via Zoom on the 7th February 2021 as part of the Official Red Dwarf Fan Club&#x27;s Holly Hop convention.

<doc id="390737" wikidata="Q244413" url="?curid=390737" title="Vincent de Paul">
<text>Vincent de Paul, CM (24 April 1581 – 27 September 1660), commonly known as Saint Vincent de Paul, was an Occitan French Catholic priest who dedicated himself to serving the poor.

In 1622, Vincent was appointed as chaplain to the galleys. After working for some time in Paris among imprisoned galley slaves, he returned to be the superior of what is now known as the Congregation of the Mission, or the &quot;Vincentians&quot; (in France known as &quot;Lazaristes&quot;), which he co-founded.

These Vincentian priests, with vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and stability, were to devote themselves entirely to the people in smaller towns and villages. Vincent was zealous in conducting retreats for clergy at a time when the local clergy&#x27;s morals were flagging. He was a pioneer in seminary education and also founded the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. He is the namesake of the Vincentian Family of organizations, which includes both of the religious communities he founded.

He was renowned for his compassion, humility, and generosity. Vincent was canonized in 1737 and is venerated as a saint in both the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion.

==Early life and education==

Vincent de Paul was born in 1581 in the village of Pouy, in the province of Guyenne and Gascony, Kingdom of France, to peasant farmers. His father was Jean de Paul and his mother was Bertrande de Moras. There was a stream named the &quot;Paul&quot; in the vicinity, and it is believed that this might have been the derivation of the family name. He wrote the name as one word, Depaul (possibly to avoid the inference that he was of noble birth), but none of his correspondents did so. He had three brothers (Jean, Bernard, and Gayon) and two sisters (Marie and Marie-Claudine). He was the third child and demonstrated a talent for literacy early in life. He also worked as a child, herding his family&#x27;s livestock. At age 15, his father sent him to a seminary, which he paid for by selling the family&#x27;s oxen.

For three years, Vincent studied at a college in Dax, Aquitaine. It adjoined a monastery of the Friars Minor, where he resided. In 1597, he enrolled in theology at the University of Toulouse. The atmosphere at the university was rough. Fights broke out between various factions of students which escalated into armed battles. An official was murdered by two students. Nevertheless, he continued his studies, financing them by tutoring others. He was ordained on 23 September 1600, at the age of nineteen, in Château-l&#x27;Évêque, near Périgueux. This was against the regulations established by the Council of Trent which required a minimum of 24 years of age for ordination, so when he was appointed parish priest in Tilh, the appointment was appealed in the Court of Rome. Rather than respond to a lawsuit in which he would probably not have prevailed, he resigned from the position and continued his studies. On 12 October 1604, he received his Bachelor of Theology from the University of Toulouse. Later he received a Licentiate in Canon Law from the University of Paris.

=== Abduction and slavery ===
Vincent wrote a letter in July 1607 and a postscript in February 1608 that described his experience of abduction and slavery. In 1605, Vincent sailed from Marseilles on his way back from Castres where he had gone to sell property he had inherited from a wealthy patron in Toulouse. He was taken captive by Barbary pirates, who took him to Tunis. De Paul was auctioned off as a slave, and spent two years in bondage.

His first master was a fisherman, but Vincent was unsuitable for this line of work due to sea sickness and was soon sold. His next master was a spagyrical physician, alchemist and inventor. Vincent became fascinated by his art and was taught how to prepare and administer his master&#x27;s remedies. The fame of Vincent&#x27;s master became so great that it attracted the attention of men who summoned him to Istanbul. During the passage, the old man died and Vincent was sold once again. His new master was a former Catholic priest and Franciscan from Nice, Guillaume Gautier. Gautier had converted to Islam in order to gain his freedom from slavery and was living in the mountains with three wives. The second wife, a Muslim by birth, was drawn to and visited Vincent in the fields to question him about his faith. She became convinced that his faith was true and admonished her husband for renouncing his Christianity. Her husband became remorseful and decided to escape back to France with his slave. They had to wait ten months, but finally they secretly boarded a small boat and crossed the Mediterranean, landing in Aigues-Mortes on 29 June 1607.

==== Controversies about abduction narrative ====
Early biographies referred to Vincent&#x27;s letters in describing his capture and enslavement from 1605 to 1607. More recently, however, some biographers have raised doubts about that narrative but have not suggested any alternative account of Vincent&#x27;s life during those two years. The biographer Pierre Coste, who wrote &quot;Monsieur Vincent&quot;, a comprehensive biography based on correspondence, interviews, and documents, publicly confirmed the accuracy of Vincent&#x27;s captivity and enslavement. According to Antoine Rédier, however, Coste privately questioned the reliability of Vincent&#x27;s letters about his enslavement but kept those doubts private to avoid scandal and potential backlash. Skeptics agree that the letters themselves were written by Vincent, but question Vincent&#x27;s account of the events of 1605–1607. Pierre Grandchamps and Paul Debongnie have argued that the captivity narrative is implausible, whereas the analysis of Guy Turbet‑Delof strongly supported Vincent&#x27;s account and concluded as follows: &quot;There is nothing in Vincent&#x27;s writing, or in other sources, that would lead us to reject his testimony. In conclusion, we must accept one of two alternatives; either Vincent de Paul was a prisoner in Tunis from 1605 to 1607, or we must regard his letter of 24th July, 1607, and the postscript dated 28th February, 1608, as a brilliant fraud which he perpetrated without any possible access to literary or other sources for inspiration.&quot;

==Return to Europe==
After returning to France, Vincent went to Rome. There he continued his studies until 1609, when he was sent back to France on a mission to King Henry IV. Once in France, he made the acquaintance of Pierre de Bérulle, whom he took as his spiritual advisor. André Duval, of the Sorbonne introduced him to Canfield&#x27;s &quot;Rule of Perfection&quot;. Vincent was by nature a rather irascible person, but he slowly learned to become more sensitive to the needs of others.

In 1612 he was sent as a parish priest to the Church of Saint-Medard in Clichy. In less than a year, Bérulle recalled him to Paris to serve as a chaplain and tutor to the Gondi family. &quot;Although Vincent had initially begun his priesthood with the intention of securing a life of leisure for himself, he underwent a change of heart after hearing the confession of a dying peasant.&quot; It was the Countess de Gondi who persuaded her husband to endow and support a group of able and zealous missionaries who would work among poor tenant farmers and country people in general.

On 13 May 1643, with Louis XIII dead, Queen Anne had her husband&#x27;s will annulled by the Parlement de Paris (a judicial body comprising mostly nobles and high clergymen), making her the sole Regent. Anne nominated Vincent de Paul as her spiritual adviser; he helped her deal with religious policy and the Jansenism question.

==Foundations of the Vincentian Family==
Vincent is the patron of all works of charity. A number of organizations specifically inspired by his work and teaching and which claim Vincent as their founder or patron saint are grouped in a loose federation known as the Vincentian Family. The 1996 publication &quot;The Vincentian Family Tree&quot; presents an overview of related communities from a genealogical perspective.

=== Confraternities, Ladies, and Daughters of Charity ===
In 1617, Vincent began serving poor families in Paris, bringing them food and comfort. He organized wealthy women of Paris as the Confraternities of Charity to assist with this work, collect funds for missionary projects, found hospitals, and gather relief funds to assist victims of war and ransom 1,200 galley slaves from North Africa. This participation of women would eventually result in, with the help of Louise de Marillac, the founding of the lay-led Ladies of Charity and the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul (), a society of apostolic life for women.

=== Congregation of the Mission ===
In 1622 Vincent was appointed a chaplain to the galleys. After working for some time in Paris among imprisoned slaves there, he founded what is now known as the Congregation of the Mission, or the &quot;Vincentians&quot; (also known in parts of Europe as the &quot;Lazarists&quot;). These priests, with vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and stability, were to devote themselves entirely to the people in smaller towns and villages.

Vincent was zealous in conducting retreats for clergy at a time when there was great laxity, abuse, and ignorance among them. He was a pioneer in clerical training and was instrumental in establishing seminaries. He spent 28 years serving as the spiritual director of the Convent of St. Mary of Angels.

== Death ==
Vincent died in Paris on 27 September 1660.

==The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul==
The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, a charitable organization dedicated to the service of the poor, was established in 1833 by French university students, led by Frédéric Ozanam. The society is today present in 153 countries.

==Veneration==
In 1705, the Superior General of the Congregation of the Mission requested that the holy process of Vincent&#x27;s canonization be instituted. On 13 August 1729 he was declared blessed by Pope Benedict XIII. He was canonized nearly eight years later by Pope Clement XII on 16 June 1737.

Vincent&#x27;s body was exhumed in 1712, 53 years after his death. The written account of an eyewitness states that &quot;the eyes and nose alone showed some decay&quot;. However, when it was exhumed again during the canonization in 1737, it was found to have decomposed due to an underground flood. His bones have been encased in a waxen figure which is displayed in a glass reliquary in the chapel of the headquarters of the Vincentian fathers in Paris, Saint Vincent de Paul Chapel, rue de Sèvres. His heart is still incorrupt, and is displayed in a reliquary in the chapel of the motherhouse of the Daughters of Charity in Paris.

In 1737, Vincent&#x27;s feast day was included in the Roman Calendar for celebration on 19 July, this date being chosen because his day of death was already used for the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian. The new celebration was given the rank of &quot;Double&quot;, and was changed to the rank of &quot;Third-Class Feast&quot; in 1960. The 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar transferred his memorial to 27 September, moving Cosmas and Damian to 26 September to make way for him, as he is now better known in the West than them.

Vincent is honored with a Lesser Festival on 27 September in the Church of England. The Episcopal Church liturgical calendar honors him together with Louise de Marillac on 15 March.

One of the feasts celebrated by the French Deist Church of the Theophilanthropy was dedicated to Vincent.

==Legacy==
Niagara University in Lewiston, New York, St. John&#x27;s University in New York City, and DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois, were founded in 1856, 1870, and 1898, respectively, by the Congregation of the Mission in the United States. Many high schools are named after Vincent.

Parishes are dedicated to Vincent in Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Omaha, Nebraska; Mays Landing, New Jersey; Mt. Vernon, Ohio. Houston, Texas; Delray Beach, Florida; Wheeling, West Virginia, Coventry, Rhode Island, Churchville, New York, Peryville, Missouri, Lenox Dale, Massachusetts, Girardville, Pennsylvania, Arlington, Texas, Denver, Colorado, Malang (Indonesia), Philippines and elsewhere.

Countless books, films, and monuments have been dedicated to his memory around the globe.

<doc id="390740" wikidata="Q2129014" url="?curid=390740" title="The Brittas Empire">
<text>The Brittas Empire is a British sitcom created and originally written by Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen. Chris Barrie played titular character Gordon Brittas, the well-intentioned but hugely incompetent manager of the fictional Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. The show ran for seven series and 52 episodes – including two Christmas specials – from 3 January 1991 to 24 February 1997 on BBC1. Creators Norriss and Fegen co-wrote the first five series. The series peaked at 10 million viewers.

&quot;The Brittas Empire&quot; enjoyed a long and successful run throughout the 1990s, and gained large mainstream audiences. In 2004, the show came 47th on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; poll, and all series have been released on DVD both individually as series and as a complete boxset. &quot;Best of the Britcoms&quot; noted the series has been hailed as &quot;the &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; of the 1990s&quot; due to its &quot;fast-paced, outrageous [comedy] full of inventive gags&quot;.

The creators Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen often combined farce with either surreal or dramatic elements in episodes. For example, in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to become electrocuted. Unlike many traditional sitcoms, deaths were quite commonplace in &quot;The Brittas Empire&quot;. Barrie described the humour as &quot;straightforward, slapstick, very accessible characters, larger-than-life abnormal things happening in a very normal situation&quot;.

==Plot summary==

Gordon Brittas (Chris Barrie) is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He trained at the fictional Aldershot Leisure Centre. Completely tactless, totally annoying, and forever coming up with &#x27;half-baked&#x27; ideas (and oblivious to all of his aforementioned faults), Brittas frequently upsets his staff, public, and his frazzled wife Helen (Pippa Haywood), often bringing confusion and chaos into their lives. Helen Brittas finds coping with Gordon increasingly difficult and often turns to medication and affairs with other men to maintain her sanity.

Helen is often helped by her supportive friend Laura Lancing (Julia St John), Brittas&#x27; calm, efficient deputy manager. Though she is fully aware of his incompetence and the annoyance he causes his colleagues and customers, Laura has a grudging admiration for Brittas, regarding him as honest and decent. His other deputy manager is the dim-witted but kind Colin Weatherby (Mike Burns) (credited as Michael Burns in series 1, 2 and 3). Colin has several medical problems including skin allergies, a constantly bandaged infected hand, and a sizeable boil on his face. Technically a deputy manager, he works more efficiently as the centre&#x27;s caretaker.

The other core members of the team are Carole (Harriet Thorpe) the unfortunate, often tearful receptionist, who keeps her three children in the reception drawers and cupboards; the gentle-hearted Gavin (Tim Marriott) who becomes Deputy Manager in Series 5; his paranoid, sometimes-manic partner Tim (Russell Porter); lively, principled Linda (Jill Greenacre); and Julie (Judy Flynn), Brittas&#x27; sarcastic secretary, who hates her boss and refuses to do any work for him.

Outside the core staff is Councillor Jack Druggett (Stephen Churchett), who is unable to sack Brittas despite numerous attempts.

Cast alterations in the series: &#x27;Angie&#x27; (Andrée Bernard), who appears as a main character in the first series, is replaced by &#x27;Julie&#x27; from series two onwards. &#x27;Laura&#x27; left the show after series five, at the same time as the creators and writers. She is replaced in series six by the character &#x27;Penny&#x27; (Anouschka Menzies). &#x27;Penny&#x27; did not return in series seven.

According to Barrie, Gordon Brittas is well-meaning but insensitive because he has a lofty dream to make the world a better place, but he doesn&#x27;t know how to execute it on the small-scale. At the same time Barrie was playing Brittas, he was also playing his other well-known role of Arnold Rimmer in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. Both characters had similar personality flaws (although Brittas always attempted to be friendly to those around him while Rimmer treated everyone with nothing but contempt) and even some of their history matched; for instance both characters had brief and unsuccessful stints at the Samaritans. &quot;Unlocking your potential&quot; describes Colin as a habitual &#x27;yes&#x27; man, who seeks validation through compliance. While Gordon himself is a larger than life creation, he is balanced out by his slightly more &#x27;normal&#x27; long suffering staff as foil to offset his antics.

==Episodes==
&quot;The Brittas Empire&quot; was broadcast for 52 episodes between 1991 and 1997, spanning seven series and two Christmas Specials, along with one short episode for Children in Need. The cast also performed in the 1996 Royal Variety Performance. Chris Barrie played Brittas again in the short fitness series spin-off, &quot;Get Fit with Brittas&quot;.

For the first five series the show&#x27;s creators Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss co-wrote every episode. After series 5 they left, along with actress Julia St John who played deputy manager Laura. At the end of Series 5 Norriss and Fegen killed off Brittas when he was crushed to death by a falling water tank. This was originally meant to be the end of the show&#x27;s run.

However, the show&#x27;s popularity meant the BBC resurrected Brittas and brought on a new team of writers who carried the show on for a further two series and one further Christmas special in 1996. These writers were: Paul Smith (who also wrote the series seven episode &quot;Malcolm ex&quot; for Andrew Marshall&#x27;s &quot;2point4 Children&quot;), Terry Kyan, Tony Millan, Mike Walling, Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent.

&quot;Curse of the Tiger Women&quot; is the final episode which aired in 1997. This ending claims all seven series were part of a dream that Brittas is having on his way to the job interview for manager of the leisure centre. It is an ending that is not well regarded by many critics and is viewed as a poor ending for such a popular show.

Episodes of the show were shown at the 1992 Visions convention.

Tickets for the live recordings were available by writing to the BBC TV Ticket unit – while tickets were free, participants had to be aged 14 and up.

The series was rerun on Gold in 2009.

In 2014, Chris Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas for a brief appearance in the Sport Relief music video, &quot;Word Up!&quot; by Little Mix.

Forces TV aired the series from 9 September 2021 until the channel shut down.

On 6 March 2023, U&amp;Drama began repeating the series.

==DVD and VHS releases==

==Critical response==
The series has received a highly positive reception from critics and fans, and has been analysed for its themes.

The book &quot;Writing Dialogue for Scripts&quot; argues that the show&#x27;s comedy is largely fuelled by the dramatic irony of the audience knowing that the main character is not important, while he believes he is, and compared Brittas to Captain Mainwaring in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. Critics John Lewis and Penny Stempel noted the series&#x27; theme of &quot;an incompetent in charge of others&quot; in the vein of TV humour from &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; to &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, coupled with an element of absurdism. &quot;The Shakespeare Library&quot; lists it as an example of a TV show that has fun with the idea of a man given a little power and authority that goes to his head. &quot;I&#x27;m Too Busy to be Stressed&quot; described Gordon as a classic example of an over-compensating individual who exhibits a sense of authority to camouflage the inferiority beneath.

The website &quot;British Comedy Guide&quot; wrote in 2021 that &quot;The Brittas Empire&quot; had &quot;aged very well&quot; in the 30 years since its debut. The character has been described by critics as a popular portrayal of an Aspergers character along with &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;, as they both demonstrate inappropriate social behaviour. According to the &quot;Eastern Europe Travel Survivors Kit 1994&quot;, shows like &quot;The Brittas Empire&quot; and American primetime soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; formed the backbone of Poland&#x27;s two state TV channels. &quot;British Cultural Identities&quot; believed the series successfully critiqued contemporary British pretensions. &quot;Red Dwarf Smegazine&quot; argued in 1993 that while &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; had been a success, &quot;Chris [Barrie] is perhaps better known by many TV viewers for The Brittas Empire&quot;. &quot;The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction&quot; wrote that the series saw Barrie achieve more mainstream success.

== Revival ==

Talks of a Christmas special or a revival were raised in 2015, though ultimately neither project were picked up. On a revival, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that while the original run &quot;never really entered the fabric of popular culture...arguably, tastes have advanced enough for people to warm to a mainstream sitcom that includes the chainsaw dismemberment of several innocent people&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Digital Spy&quot; wrote that the show &quot;arguably inspired Ricky Gervais&#x27; &quot;The Office&quot; in the early noughties, which went on to have huge success – so it&#x27;s only natural &quot;The Brittas Empire&quot; may be in for a reboot&quot;. 

In October 2017, the cast and original writers attended the re-launching of the Ringwood Recreation Centre, where the series was filmed, and Barrie hoped the event would be a catalyst for an eighth series. He advised &quot;there&#x27;s so much momentum for it, now&#x27;s the time.&quot; At this stage, original writers Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen were working on a new script.

In 2018, a Comic Relief producer worked with Barrie to get a Brittas Empire skit on the programme, but was unsuccessful.

==Influence==
The show has been credited with having an influence on Alan Partridge and &quot;The Office&quot;.

==Setting==
Many of the interior scenes of the leisure centre were filmed in the BBC studios. The exterior shots and interior swimming pools of &#x27;Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre&#x27; were filmed at Ringwood Leisure Centre, Hampshire. Other external locations such as the Brittas house were also filmed in Ringwood.

<doc id="390745" wikidata="Q204487" url="?curid=390745" title="Zine El Abidine Ben Ali">
<text>Zine El Abidine Ben Ali (Tunisian Arabic: , ; 3 September 1936 – 19 September 2019), commonly known as Ben Ali or Ezzine, was a Tunisian politician and dictator who served as the second President of Tunisia from 1987 to 2011. In that year, during the Tunisian revolution, he was overthrown and fled to Saudi Arabia.

Ben Ali was appointed Prime Minister in October 1987. He assumed the Presidency on 7 November 1987 in a bloodless coup d&#x27;état that ousted President Habib Bourguiba by declaring him incompetent. Ben Ali led an authoritarian regime. He was reelected in several non-democratic elections where he won with enormous majorities, each time exceeding 90% of the vote, his final re-election coming on 25 October 2009. Ben Ali was the penultimate surviving leader deposed in the Arab Spring; he was survived by Egypt&#x27;s Hosni Mubarak, the latter dying in February 2020.

On 14 January 2011, following a month of protests against his rule, he fled to Saudi Arabia along with his wife Leïla Ben Ali and their three children. The interim Tunisian government asked Interpol to issue an international arrest warrant, charging him with money laundering and drug trafficking. A Tunisian court sentenced Ben Ali and his wife &quot;in absentia&quot; to 35 years in prison on 20 June 2011 on charges of theft and unlawful possession of cash and jewelry, which was put up for auction. In June 2012, a Tunisian court sentenced him &quot;in absentia&quot; to life imprisonment for inciting violence and murder and another life sentence by a military court in April 2013 for violent repression of protests in Sfax. He served none of those sentences, subsequently dying in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on 19 September 2019 at the age of 83 after nearly a decade in exile.

==Early life, education and military career==
Ben Ali was born in 1936 to moderate-income parents as the fourth of eleven children in the family. His father worked as a guard at the port city of Sousse.
Ben Ali joined the local resistance against French colonial forces and was imprisoned. His expulsion from secondary school was the reason why he never completed his secondary education. He studied at the Sousse Technical Institute but failed to earn a professional certificate and joined the newly formed Tunisian Army in 1958. Nevertheless, after being chosen as one among a group of young officers, he was awarded training in France at the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr in Coëtquidan and the School of Applied Artillery in Châlons-sur-Marne, and also in the United States at the Senior Intelligence School in Maryland and the School for Anti-Aircraft Field Artillery in Texas. He also held a diploma in electronics engineering from a local university. Returning to Tunisia in 1964, he began his professional military career the same year as a Tunisian staff officer. During his time in military service, he established the Military Security Department and directed its operations for 10 years. He briefly served as military attaché in the Tunisian embassy of Morocco and Spain before being appointed General Director of National Security in 1977.

In April 1980, Ben Ali was appointed ambassador to Poland, and served in that position for four years. He also served as the military intelligence chief from 1964 to 1974 and later Director General of national security between December 1977 and 1980 until he was appointed as Minister of Defense. Soon after the Tunisian bread riots in January 1984, he was reappointed director-general of national security. 

Ben Ali subsequently served as Minister of State in charge of the interior before being appointed Interior Minister on 28 April 1986 then Prime Minister by President Habib Bourguiba in October 1987.

==Rise to presidency==
On the morning of 7 November 1987, doctors attending to President Bourguiba filed an official medical report declaring him medically incapacitated and unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency. Ben Ali, next in line to the presidency, removed Bourguiba from office and assumed the presidency himself. The day of his accession to power was celebrated annually in Tunisia as New Era Day. Two of the names given to Ben Ali&#x27;s rise to the presidency include &quot;the medical coup d&#x27;état&quot; and the &quot;Tunisian revolution&quot;. Ben Ali favoured the latter. Ben Ali’s assumption of the presidency was in conformity with Article 57 of the Tunisian Constitution. The country had faced 10% inflation, external debt accounting for 46% of GDP and a debt service ratio of 21% of GDP.

In 1999, Fulvio Martini, former head of Italian military secret service SISMI, declared to a parliamentary committee that &quot;from 1985 to 1987, we organized a coup of sorts in Tunisia, putting President Ben Ali as head of state, replacing Bourguiba who wanted to flee&quot;. Bourguiba, although a symbol of anti-colonial resistance, was considered incapable of leading his country any longer, and his reaction to the rising Islamic integrism was deemed &quot;a bit too energetic&quot; by Martini; Bourguiba&#x27;s threat to execute the suspects might have generated strong negative responses in neighbouring countries. Acting under directives from Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi and Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, Martini claims to have brokered the accord that led to the peaceful transition of powers.

According to Martini, the SISMI did not have an operational role in Ben Ali&#x27;s rise to power, but organised a move to support his new government politically and economically, preventing Tunisia from falling into an open confrontation with fundamentalists, as happened in Algeria in the following years.

==Presidency (1987–2011)==

===Politics===
Alan Cowell, a prominent New York Times journalist, believed Ben Ali&#x27;s initial promises of a more democratic way of ruling the country than had prevailed under Bourguiba. One of his first acts upon taking office was to loosen restrictions on the press; for the first time state-controlled newspapers published statements from the opposition. Ben Ali also released some political prisoners and granted them with pardons. In 1988, he changed the name of the ruling Destourian Socialist Party to the Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD), and pushed through constitutional amendments that limited the president to three five-year terms, with no more than two in a row.

However, the conduct of the 1989 elections was little different from past elections. The RCD swept every seat in the legislature, and Ben Ali appeared alone on the ballot in Tunisia&#x27;s first presidential election since 1974. Although opposition parties had been legal since 1981, presidential candidates were required to get endorsements from 30 political figures. Given the RCD&#x27;s near-absolute dominance of the political scene, prospective opposition candidates discovered they could not get their nomination papers signed. The subsequent years saw the return of several Bourguiba-era restrictions. For many years, the press had been expected to practice self-censorship, but this increasingly gave way to official censorship. Amendments to the press code allowed the Interior Ministry to review all newspaper and magazine articles before publication. In 1992, the president&#x27;s younger brother Habib Ben Ali was tried in absentia in France for laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking, in a case known as the &quot;couscous connection&quot;. French television news was blocked in Tunisia during the trial.

At the 1994 elections, opposition parties polled 2.25% and gained 19 of 163 seats in Parliament—the first-time opposition parties had actually managed to get into the chamber. Ben Ali was unopposed for a second full term, again after being the only candidate to get enough endorsements to qualify. Turnout was officially reported at 95%. However, at this and subsequent elections, opposition parties never accounted for more than 24 percent of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies. All legislation continued to originate with the president, and there was little meaningful opposition to executive decisions.

In 1999, Ben Ali became the first Tunisian president to actually face an opponent after the 30-signature requirement was lifted a few months earlier. However, he won a third full term with an implausible 99.4 percent of the vote.

A constitutional referendum in 2002—the first ever held in Tunisia—established a two-chambered parliament, creating the Chamber of Advisers. It also allowed the president to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms and amended the upper age limit for a presidential candidate to 75 years old (previously 70). The latter measures were clearly aimed at keeping Ben Ali in office; he faced having to give up the presidency in 2004. He was duly reelected in 2004, again by an implausibly high margin—this time 94 percent of the vote.

Tunisia under Ben Ali was known for its human rights violations such as lack of freedom of the press, highlighted by the official treatment of the journalist Taoufik Ben Brik, who was harassed and imprisoned for his criticism of Ben Ali. By the dawn of the new millennium, Ben Ali was reckoned as leading one of the most repressive regimes in the world. Under his rule, Tunisia consistently ranked near the bottom of most international rankings for human rights and press freedom.

On 25 October 2009, Ben Ali was re-elected for a fifth term with 89% of the vote. The African Union sent a team of observers to cover the election. The delegation was led by Benjamin Bounkoulou, who described the election as &quot;free and fair&quot;. However, a spokesperson from the US State Department indicated that Tunisia had not permitted monitoring of the election by international observers, but that the U.S. was still committed to working with the Ben Ali and the Tunisian government. There also were reports of mistreatment of an opposition candidate.

In December 2010 and January 2011, riots over unemployment escalated into a widespread popular protest movement against Ben Ali&#x27;s government. On 13 January 2011, he announced he would not run for another term in 2014, and pledged steps to improve the economy and loosen restrictions on the press. The following day, however, thousands demonstrated in the center of Tunis, demanding Ben Ali&#x27;s immediate resignation. On 14 January 2011, Ben Ali, his wife and children fled to Saudi Arabia, and a caretaker ruling committee headed by Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi was announced.

===Economy===

As president, Ben Ali instituted economic reforms that increased Tunisia&#x27;s growth rate and foreign investment. During his administration, Tunisia&#x27;s per capita GDP more than tripled from $1,201 in 1986 to $3,786 in 2008. Although growth in 2002 slowed to a 15-year low of 1.9% due to drought and lackluster tourism (partly due to some tourists being nervous about flying in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in New York), better conditions after 2003 helped push growth to about 5% of GDP. For about 20 years after 1987, the GDP annual growth averaged nearly 5%. A report published in July 2010 by the Boston Consulting Group (&quot;The African Challengers: Global Competitors Emerge from the Overlooked Continent&quot;) listed Tunisia as one of the African &quot;Lions&quot; and indicated the eight such countries account for 70% of the continent&#x27;s gross domestic product.

Steady increases in GDP growth continued through positive trade relations with the European Union, a revitalised tourism industry and sustained agricultural production. Privatization, increasing foreign investment, improvements in government efficiency and reduction of the trade deficit presented challenges for the future. The 2010/11 Global Competitiveness Report (Davos World Economic Forum) ranked Tunisia 1st in Africa and 32nd globally out of 139 countries but it dropped to 40th in 2011/12 as a result of political instability and was not ranked in 2012/13.
According to the Oxford Business Group, Tunisia&#x27;s economy was likely to grow from 2008 thanks to its diversified industries.

Committed to fighting poverty at home, Ben Ali instituted reforms, including the National Solidarity Fund, which slashed the Tunisian poverty rate from 7.4% in 1990 to an estimated 3.8% in 2005. The National Solidarity Fund was part of a dual strategy to fight current and potential terrorism through economic assistance, development and the rule of law, but also increased opportunities for corruption and clientelism. The fund provided opportunities to those living in impoverished areas and are vulnerable to recruitment by terrorists. It was a critical element in the fight against terrorism.

However, Tunisia continued to suffer from high unemployment, especially among youth. Left out of the recent prosperity were many rural and urban poor, including small businesses facing the world market. This and the blocking of free speech were the causes of the Tunisian revolution.

===Diplomacy===

During Ben Ali&#x27;s presidency, Tunisia pursued a moderate foreign policy promoting peaceful settlement of conflicts. Tunisia took a middle of the road approach contributing to peacemaking, especially in the Middle East and Africa. Tunisia hosted the first-ever Palestinian American dialogue. While contributing actively to the Middle East peace process, Tunisian diplomacy has supported the Palestinian cause. As host to the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1982–1993, Ben Ali&#x27;s government tried to moderate the views of that organisation. Tunisia, since the early 1990s, called for a &quot;concerted&quot; international effort against terrorism. It was also a key US partner in the effort to fight global terrorism through the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative.
Ben Ali mostly retained his predecessor&#x27;s pro-western foreign policy, though he improved ties with the Arab and Muslim world. He took several initiatives to promote solidarity, dialogue and cooperation among nations. Ben Ali initiated the creation of the United Nations World Solidarity Fund to eradicate poverty and promote social development based on the successful experience of the Tunisian National Solidarity Fund. Ben Ali also played a lead role in the UN&#x27;s proclaiming 2010 as the International Year of Youth.

===International characterisations===

Ben Ali&#x27;s government was considered to have one of the worst human rights records in the world. It largely bucked the trend toward greater democracy in Africa. The level of repression became particularly severe during what would be the last decade of his rule. Ben Ali&#x27;s government was deemed dictatorial, authoritarian and undemocratic by international human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Freedom House, and Protection International. They criticised Tunisian officials for not observing international standards of political rights and interfering with the work of local human rights organisations. In &quot;The Economist&quot;″s 2010 Democracy Index, Tunisia was classified as an authoritarian regime, ranking 144th out of 167 countries studied. In 2008, in terms of freedom of the press, Tunisia was ranked 143 out of 173.

== Revolution and overthrow ==
In response to the protests, Ben Ali declared a state of emergency, dissolved the government on 14 January 2011, and promised new legislative elections within six months. However, events moved quickly, and it appears the armed forces and key members of the legislature had lost confidence in Ben Ali and had decided to take steps of their own. With power slipping from Ben Ali&#x27;s grasp, prime minister Mohamed Ghannouchi announced that he would act as head of state during the president&#x27;s &quot;temporary&quot; absence. With the army surrounding the Presidential Palace in Tunis, Ben Ali and close members of his family hastily left and headed to Laouina airport (annexed to the Tunis–Carthage International Airport). The military allowed Ben Ali&#x27;s plane to take off, immediately after which the Tunisian airspace was closed. The presidential plane then left for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Subsequent reports in the media rumoured that Ben Ali was seeking protection in either France or Malta, although a Tunisian pilot who was involved in the arrangement of the flight stated that the plan was &quot;to fly directly to Jeddah&quot;, which is also supported by recordings released by the BBC in 2022. Ben Ali and his family were accepted by King Abdullah to live in Saudi Arabia under the condition that he should keep out of politics. Ben Ali and his family went to exile in Jeddah, the same city where Idi Amin, the late dictator of Uganda, lived in exile until his death in 2003 after being removed from power in 1979 at the end of the Uganda–Tanzania War.

Other close associates and family members who attempted to leave the country via Tunis-Carthage were prevented from doing so by the army, which had seized the airport.

===Succession confusion===

At about 18:00, Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi went on state television to say &quot;Since the president is temporarily unable to exercise his duties, it has been decided that the prime minister will temporarily exercise the (presidential) duties.&quot;

However, this arrangement was very short-lived, because early the following day (15 January 2011), the Constitutional Council of Tunisia determined that Ben Ali was not &quot;temporarily unable&quot; to exercise his duties and that the presidency was in fact vacant. The arrangements he had made with the Prime Minister before leaving the country were found to be unconstitutional under article 57 of the constitution. The country&#x27;s constitutional council, at the time the highest legal authority on constitutional matters, announced the transition saying that Fouad Mebazaa, the Speaker of Parliament, had been appointed acting president.

Mebazaa took the oath in his office in parliament, swearing to respect the constitution in the presence of his senate counterpart, Abdallal Kallel, and representatives of both houses. It was also announced that the speaker of parliament would occupy the post of president temporarily and that elections would be held within a period of between 45 and 60 days.

=== Flight and trial in absentia ===
On 26 January 2011, the Tunisian government issued an international arrest warrant for Ben Ali, accusing him of taking money out of the nation illegally and illegally acquiring real estate and other assets abroad, Justice Minister Lazhar Karoui Chebbi said. Videos show that the president stashed cash and jewellery in the president&#x27;s palace. The gold and jewellery will be redistributed to the people by the government. The Swiss government announced that it was freezing millions of dollars held in bank accounts by his family. On 28 January 2011, Interpol issued an arrest warrant for Ben Ali and his six family members, including his wife Leïla.

After Ben Ali fled Tunisia following the Tunisian revolution, he and his wife were tried &quot;in absentia&quot; for his suspected involvement in some of the country&#x27;s largest businesses during his 23-year-long reign. On 20 June 2011, Ben Ali and his wife were sentenced to 35 years in prison after being found guilty of theft and unlawful possession of cash and jewelry. The verdict also included a penalty of 91 million Tunisian dinars (approximately €50 million, and $64 million) that Ben Ali was required to pay. This verdict was dismissed as a &quot;charade&quot; by some Tunisians dissatisfied with the trial and as a &quot;joke&quot; by Ben Ali&#x27;s lawyer. The sentences were to take immediate effect, although Ben Ali and his wife were living in Saudi Arabia and the Saudi government ignored Tunisia&#x27;s requests to extradite them.

In November 2016, Ben Ali made a statement via the office of his lawyer, Mounir Ben Salha, acknowledging his regime made &quot;errors, abuses and violations&quot;. His statement came as a reaction to the public hearing sessions made by the Truth and Dignity Commission in Tunisia. 

==Family==

Ben Ali and his family were accused of corruption, which was a major contribution to the Tunisian Revolution which led to the fall of his government. Many of Ben Ali&#x27;s family members subsequently also fled the country. On 20 January 2011, Tunisian television reported that 33 members of Ben Ali&#x27;s family had been arrested in the past week, as they tried to flee the country.

Leïla Ben Ali was the chair of the BASMA Association, a group that promotes social integration and provides employment opportunities for the disabled. She was also the president of the Arab Women Organization, which works to empower women in Arab states. She has three children: Nesrine, Halima and Mohamed Zine El Abidine. Ben Ali had three daughters from his first marriage: Ghazwa, Dorsaf and Cyrine.

== Health condition and death ==
On 17 February 2011, it was reported that Ben Ali had suffered a stroke, and had been hospitalised for an indefinite period. Al Jazeera reported that a Saudi source had confirmed that Ben Ali had indeed sustained severe complications of a stroke and that he was in critical condition. The information has never been confirmed or denied by the Saudi government. However, on 17 June 2011, Ben Ali&#x27;s attorney, Jean-Yves Leborgne, stated that Ben Ali &quot;is not in the state that he&#x27;s said to be in&quot; and that &quot;a meeting with his client took place under &#x27;normal circumstances&#x27;&quot;.

Ben Ali died at a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, due to prostate cancer on 19 September 2019 at the age of 83. He was buried on 21 September at the Al-Baqi Cemetery in Medina.

<text>Pentonville is an area in North London, located in the London Borough of Islington. It is located north-northeast of Charing Cross on the Inner Ring Road. Pentonville developed in the northwestern edge of the ancient parish of Clerkenwell on the New Road. It is named after Henry Penton, the developer of the area.

==History==

The area is named after Henry Penton, who developed a number of streets in the 1770s in what was open countryside adjacent to the New Road. Pentonville was part of the ancient parish of Clerkenwell, and was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury by the London Government Act 1899. It has been part of the London Borough of Islington since 1965. There was a Pentonville ward from 1965 to 1978, electing three councillors to Islington London Borough Council.
Pentonville is the birthplace of John Stuart Mill (1806) and Forbes Benignus Winslow (1810), the noted psychiatrist. In 1902 Vladimir Lenin and his wife lived just off Pentonville Road, and it was at this time that he first met his fellow exile Leon Trotsky.

==Geography==

Nearby places include Islington, St. Pancras and Finsbury.

Pentonville is not the location of HM Prison Pentonville, which is located on Caledonian Road, some distance north in Barnsbury.

==Transport==
The closest tube stations are Angel and King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras.

==In popular culture==
*Mr Brownlow, a character in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838), lives in &quot;a quiet shady street near Pentonville&quot; in the novel and most film versions. However, in the musical adaptation, &quot;Oliver!&quot;, he lives in Bloomsbury Square.
*Mr Guppy, a law clerk in Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), has &quot;lodgings at Penton Place, Pentonville. It is lowly, but airy, open at the back, and considered one of the &#x27;ealthiest outlets.&quot;
*Hyacinth Robinson, the central character in Henry James&#x27; &quot;The Princess Casamassima&quot; (1886), lives in Pentonville with his adoptive mother who works as a seamstress.
*&quot;Pentonville&quot; is a track on the Babyshambles album &quot;Down in Albion&quot; (2005).

<text>The &quot;Brazilian Flag Anthem&quot; (, &quot;Hymn to the National Flag&quot;) is a Brazilian patriotic song dedicated to the national flag of Brazil.

==History==
The song&#x27;s lyrics were written by poet Olavo Bilac, and the music composed by Francisco Braga, at the request of the then mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Francisco Pereira Passos. The anthem was presented for the first time on November 9, 1906, and was originally intended to be sung by the schoolchildren of Rio de Janeiro during flag replacement ceremonies in the city&#x27;s schools. Hence the reference to &quot;youthful chest&quot; in the lyrics. Around that same time, the anthem was considered as a possible replacement for the Brazilian National Anthem, that at that time had no official lyrics.

The Flag Anthem (as all other patriotic anthems and songs) was highly praised in the past, especially during the military dictatorship of 1964–1985, but has since lost some of its appeal. It is still performed on November 19 (Flag Day), as well as in flag replacement ceremonies.

==Protocol==

Flag replacement ceremonies (held in military institutions, in schools, etc., and periodically also at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília, the capital of Brazil, to replace the flag that hovers over the seat of the Brazilian government), usually consist of the Flag Anthem being played while the old flag is lowered, and the National Anthem being played while the new flag is raised. In the case of perpetual displays of the flag (places where the national flag is always displayed without even minimal interruptions), such as the case of the aforementioned flag in the &quot;Praça dos Três Poderes&quot;, the new flag is raised first, while the national anthem is played, and only then the old flag is lowered, while the Flag Anthem is sung.

<text>Robert Llewellyn (born 10 March 1956) is a British actor, comedian, presenter and writer. He plays the mechanoid Kryten in the sci-fi television sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and formerly presented the engineering gameshow &quot;Scrapheap Challenge&quot;. He has also founded and hosts a YouTube series, &quot;Fully Charged&quot;, which has grown into a company that puts on EV and &quot;Everything Electric&quot; conventions in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and Europe.

==Early life and career==
Llewellyn was born in Northampton, England. Llewellyn&#x27;s first foray into the world of show business started out as a hobby, organising a few amateur cabaret evenings in a riverside warehouse overlooking Tower Bridge in London. The shows were a great success and he eventually helped form an alternative comedy theatre group called The Joeys. Within six months, he had stopped working as a shoemaker and started performing professionally with the group alongside Bernie Evans, Nigel Ordish and Graham Allum. The group toured Britain and France in the early 1980s, with an initial idea of exploring sexual politics between men. Llewellyn wrote much of the material, and also began writing novels. The Joeys split in 1985, having toured for years and done thousands of performances. He co-wrote and starred in &quot;The Corner House&quot;, a 1987 sitcom for Channel 4 about a café run by gay men.

==&quot;Red Dwarf&quot;==
Llewellyn&#x27;s involvement with &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; came about as a result of his appearance at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, performing in his one-man comedy, &quot;Mammon, Robot Born of Woman&quot;, about a robot who, as he becomes more human, begins to behave increasingly badly. This was seen by Paul Jackson, producer of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, and Llewellyn was invited to audition for the role of Kryten.

Llewellyn joined the cast of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in 1989 at the start of the third series. Llewellyn&#x27;s skills as a physical performer encouraged Rob Grant and Doug Naylor to write him additional characters for the series, namely Jim Reaper (&quot;The Last Day&quot;), Human Kryten (&quot;DNA&quot;), Bongo (&quot;Dimension Jump&quot;), Able (&quot;Beyond A Joke&quot;) and the Data Doctor (&quot;Back in the Red&quot;). With Doug Naylor, Llewellyn also co-wrote the episode &quot;Beyond A Joke&quot; which screened in 1997.

In the early days of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, Llewellyn would arrive to do make-up many hours before the rest of the actors; however, that changed as time progressed, as his fellow actors &quot;have a little bit more help in the makeup department than they used to&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Skeptic Zone&quot;, Llewellyn mentioned that he needs a special pair of glasses to be able to read the script with the Kryten mask on. In &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, he worked hard to get the more technically difficult lines right because the series tried to be factually accurate in reference to scientific theories.

Llewellyn was also the only British cast member of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; to originally participate in a proposed American version, though other actors such as Craig Charles and Chris Barrie were also approached to reprise their roles.

==Other television work==

Llewellyn has presented a number of programmes for UK television. His first outing as a presenter was on &quot;Scrapheap Challenge&quot;, produced by Channel 4; the series saw teams of engineers competing to build machines to complete a given task from materials scavenged from a scrapheap. His other presenting roles include a version of Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;How Do They Do It?&quot; and the BBC/Open University programme &quot;Hollywood Science&quot;.

In 1992, Llewellyn appeared in &quot;Parade&quot;, the fourth episode of series two of &quot;Bottom&quot;, as a wounded Falklands War veteran named Mr. N. Stiles.

Llewellyn&#x27;s project &quot;it2i2&quot; was released on DVD in March 2006. Since then, he has had a YouTube video blog called &quot;Llewtube&quot;. His book &quot;Sold Out: How I Survived a Year of Not Shopping&quot; — based on his YouTube series &quot;Making Do&quot; — was published in October 2008.

In February 2009, Llewellyn featured as a guest in episode 127 of the technology-related podcast &quot;MacBreak Weekly&quot; with Leo Laporte&quot;.

In 2007 Llewellyn appeared as the Prime Minister in an episode of the CBBC series &quot;M.I. High&quot;. He presented the 2008 Channel 5 game show &quot;Top Trumps&quot;.

Llewellyn reviewed the world of science and technology in his popular &quot;Machine of the Week&quot; report.

Since 2009 Llewellyn has provided the voice of news anchor Perry Flynn for &quot;PlayStation Home TV&quot;, which airs in the &quot;Home Theatre of the European&quot; version of PlayStation Home.

Llewellyn has worked as a voice actor, providing the voices of the alien creatures in &quot;Skywhales&quot; (1983), the voice of Feeble for &quot;The Feeble Files&quot; (1997), Old Joe in &quot;Christmas Carol: The Movie&quot;, and the gryphon in the 2005 film &quot;MirrorMask&quot;. In the documentary &quot;Dwarfing USA&quot; (released on the DVD of &quot;Red Dwarf V&quot;), he described himself as &quot;very much a &#x27;don&#x27;t want to do it now&#x27; kind of person&quot;.

Llewellyn&#x27;s web series &quot;Carpool&quot; ran from 2009 to 2014, and spawned a television series of the same name on the television channel Dave from 2010-2011. In January 2011, Llewellyn appeared on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; answering questions on the specialist subject of electric cars; he has expressed an interest in working on a television series about technologies that we might use in the future.

In 2010, Llewellyn was the narrator of the Channel 5 series &quot;The Boss is Coming to Dinner&quot;. He appeared in the 2013 movie &quot;Ashens and the Quest for the GameChild&quot; alongside Stuart Ashen and Warwick Davis, and the 2020 sequel, &quot;Ashens and the Polybius Heist&quot;.

Llewellyn presented the 2015 BBC Two show &quot;The World&#x27;s Busiest Railway&quot; alongside Dan Snow and Anita Rani, which later featured on Netflix under the title &quot;Mumbai Railway&quot;.

In 2019, Llewellyn was a contestant alongside Craig Charles on the BBC One series &quot;Antiques Road Trip&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Prior to becoming a comedian, Llewellyn served an apprenticeship and became a professional shoemaker, working at James Taylor &amp; Son and John Lobb Bootmaker in London. Speaking to Richard Herring, he said he still maintains an interest in the craft: &quot;There is still a side of me that wants to develop a kind of 3D printed shoe thing...where you just put your foot in a thing, and you just get a shoe and it&#x27;s there. And it fits absolutely exquisitely, immediately.&quot;
Llewellyn, who is of Welsh ancestry, learned to drive aged 11 (having been taught by his older brother in a go-kart). Formerly a &quot;petrol-head&quot;, he is now an electric car and renewable energy advocate. As well as being frequently interviewed on the subject, he presents a YouTube series called &quot;Fully Charged&quot;.

On the evening of 1 July 2009, while Llewellyn was en route to deliver &quot;Carpool&quot; footage to his editor, another vehicle hit him side-on at a junction in Gloucestershire, writing off his Toyota Prius and rendering him unconscious for around ten minutes. The force of the impact was such that it bent his laptop &quot;into a banana shape&quot;. Llewellyn praised the honesty of the other driver for accepting full liability for the accident, as well as the hospital, police and other services for helping him. He also gave special praise to his &quot;beloved Prius&quot; for protecting him from the impact. He suffered concussion, minor whiplash and dizzy spells but escaped more serious injury.

In 2014 he drove, with David Peilow, a Nissan Leaf 400 miles from London to Edinburgh. Stopping nine times, it took 12 hours, beating a previous time set by the BBC three years earlier which took four days in a Mini-E, as well as beating the time set by Peilow in a 2008 Tesla Roadster, which, having left two days after the Mini-E, took around 19 hours.

Llewellyn has expressed that his major pseudoscientific irritations are astrology and climate change denial.

Llewellyn lives in Temple Guiting, Gloucestershire and is married to Australian author Judy Pascoe (who herself had a cameo in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; as a one-off love interest of Llewellyn&#x27;s character, in the episode &quot;Camille&quot; playing a character of the same name).

<doc id="390757" wikidata="Q470747" url="?curid=390757" title="Sprain">
<text>A sprain is a soft tissue injury of the ligaments within a joint, often caused by a sudden movement abruptly forcing the joint to exceed its functional range of motion. Ligaments are tough, inelastic fibers made of collagen that connect two or more bones to form a joint and are important for joint stability and proprioception, which is the body&#x27;s sense of limb position and movement. Sprains may be mild (first degree), moderate (second degree), or severe (third degree), with the latter two classes involving some degree of tearing of the ligament. Sprains can occur at any joint but most commonly occur in the ankle, knee, or wrist. An equivalent injury to a muscle or tendon is known as a strain.

The majority of sprains are mild, causing minor swelling and bruising that can be resolved with conservative treatment, typically summarized as RICE: rest, ice, compression, elevation. However, severe sprains involve complete tears, ruptures, or avulsion fractures, often leading to joint instability, severe pain, and decreased functional ability. These sprains require surgical fixation, prolonged immobilization, and physical therapy.

== Signs and symptoms ==
* Pain
* Swelling
* Bruising or hematoma caused by broken blood vessels within the injured ligament
*Joint instability
*Difficulty with bearing weight
* Decreased functional ability or range of motion of the injured joint
*Ligament rupture may cause a cracking or popping sound at the time of injury

Knowing the signs and symptoms of a sprain can be helpful in differentiating the injury from a strain or simple fracture. Strains typically present with pain, cramping, muscle spasm, and muscle weakness, and fractures typically present with bone tenderness, especially when bearing weight.

== Causes ==
Acute sprains typically occur when the joint is abruptly forced beyond its functional range of motion, often in the setting of trauma or sports injuries. The most common cause of sprains in general is repetitive movements (overuse).

=== Mechanism ===
Ligaments are collagen fibers that connect bones together, providing passive stabilization to a joint. These fibers can be found in various organizational patterns (parallel, oblique, spiral, etc.) depending on the function of the joint involved. Ligaments can be extra-capsular (located outside the joint capsule), capsular (continuation of the joint capsule), or intra-articular (located within a joint capsule). The location has important implications for healing as blood flow to intra-articular ligaments is diminished compared to extra-capsular or capsular ligaments.

Collagen fibers have about a 4% elastic zone where fibers stretch out with increased load on the joint. However, exceeding this elastic limit causes a rupture of fibers, leading to a sprain. It is important to recognize that ligaments adapt to training by increasing the cross-sectional area of fibers. When a ligament is immobilized, the ligament has been shown to rapidly weaken. Normal daily activity is important for maintaining about 80–90% of the mechanical properties of a ligament.

=== Risk factors ===

* Fatigue and overuse
* High-intensity contact sports
* Environmental factors
* Poor conditioning or equipment
*Age and genetic predisposition to ligament injuries
* Lack of stretching or &quot;warming up&quot;, which when performed properly increases blood flow and joint flexibility

== Diagnosis ==
Sprains can often be diagnosed clinically based on the patient&#x27;s signs and symptoms, mechanism of injury, and physical examination. However, x-rays can be obtained to help identify fractures, especially in cases of tenderness or bone pain at the injured site. In some instances, particularly if the healing process is prolonged or a more serious injury is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed to look at the surrounding soft tissue and ligaments.

=== Classification ===
#First degree sprain (mild) – There is minor stretching and structural damage to the ligament, leading to mild swelling and bruising. Patients typically present without joint instability or decreased range of motion of the joint.
#Second degree sprain (moderate) – There is a partial tear of the affected ligament. Patients typically experience moderate swelling, tenderness, and some instability of the joint. There may be some difficulty bearing weight on the affected joint.
#Third degree sprain (severe) – There is a complete rupture or tear of the ligament, sometimes avulsing a piece of bone. Patients typically experience severe joint instability, pain, bruising, swelling, and inability to apply weight to the joint.

=== Joints involved ===

Although any joint can experience a sprain, some of the more common injuries include the following:
*Ankle - Sprains most commonly occur at the ankle and can take longer to heal than ankle bone fractures. Most sprained ankles usually occur in the lateral ligaments on the outside of the ankle. Common causes include walking on uneven surfaces or during contact sports. See sprained ankle or high ankle sprain for more details.
**Inversion Ankle Sprain - injury that occurs when ankle rolls inward
**Eversion Ankle Sprain - injury that occurs when ankle rolls outward
*Toes
**Turf toe (metatarsophalangeal joint sprain) - forced hyperextension of the big toe upwards, especially during sports (initiating a sprint on a hard surface)

*Knee - Sprains commonly occur at the knee, especially following intense pivoting on a planted leg during contact sports (American football, football, basketball, pole vaulting, softball, baseball and some styles of martial arts).
**Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury
**Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury
**Medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury
**Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury
**Superior Tibiofibular Joint Sprain - typically caused by a twisting injury to the joint connecting the tibia (shinbone) and fibula
**Patellar dislocation

*Fingers and wrists - Wrist sprains commonly occur, especially during a fall on an outstretched hand.
**Gamekeeper&#x27;s thumb (Skier&#x27;s thumb) - forceful grabbing that leads to an injury to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the thumb, historically found in Scottish gamekeepers
*Spine
**Neck sprain at the cervical vertebrae
**Whiplash (Traumatic Cervical Spine Syndrome) - forced hyperextension and flexion of the neck, classically found in rear-end auto accidents
**Back sprain - Back sprains are one of the most common medical complaints, often caused by poor lifting mechanics and weak core muscles.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of sprains usually involves incorporating conservative measures to reduce the signs and symptoms of sprains, surgery to repair severe tears or ruptures, and rehabilitation to restore function to the injured joint. Although most sprains can be managed without surgery, severe injuries may require tendon grafting or ligament repair based on the individual&#x27;s circumstances. The amount of rehabilitation and time needed for recovery will depend on the severity of the sprain.

A foot sprain is an injury to the ligaments that connect bones within the foot. The recovery process for a foot sprain is crucial for restoring normal function and preventing future injuries. This article outlines the general approach to foot sprain recovery, which varies depending on the severity of the injury.

=== Non-surgical ===
Depending on the mechanism of injury, joint involvement, and severity, most sprains can be treated using conservative measures following the acronym RICE within the first 24 hours of sustaining an injury. However, it is important to recognize that treatments should be individualized depending on the patient&#x27;s particular injury and symptoms. Over-the-counter medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help relieve pain, and topical NSAIDs can be as effective as medications taken by mouth.

* Protect: The injured site should be protected and immobilized, as there is an increased risk of recurrent injury to the affected ligaments.
* Rest: The joint affected should be immobilized and bearing weight should be minimized. For example, walking should be limited in cases of sprained ankles.
* Ice: Ice should be applied immediately to the sprain to reduce swelling and pain. Ice can be applied 3–4 times a day for 10–15 minutes at a time or until the swelling subsides and can be combined with a wrapping for support. Ice can also be used to numb pain but should only be applied for a short period of time (less than twenty minutes) for this purpose. Prolonged ice exposure can reduce blood flow to the injured area and slow the healing process.
* Compression: Dressings, bandages, or wraps should be used to immobilize the sprain and provide support. When wrapping the injury, more pressure should be applied to the distal end of the injury and decrease in the direction of the heart. This helps circulate the blood from the extremities to the heart. Careful management of swelling through cold compression therapy is critical to the healing process by preventing further pooling of fluid in the sprained area. However, compression should not impede circulation of the limb.
* Elevation: Keeping the sprained joint elevated (in relation to the rest of the body) can minimize swelling.

Other non-operative therapies including the continuous passive motion machine (moves joint without patient exertion) and cryocuff (type of cold compress that is activated similarly to a blood pressure cuff) have been effective in reducing swelling and improving range of motion. Recent studies have shown that traction is just as effective as the RICE technique in treating ankle sprains in pediatric patients.

=== Functional rehabilitation ===
The components of an effective rehabilitation program for all sprain injuries include increasing the range of motion of the affected joint and progressive muscle strengthening exercises. After implementing conservative measures to reduce swelling and pain, mobilizing the limb within 48–72 hours following injury has been shown to promote healing by stimulating growth factors in musculoskeletal tissues linked to cellular division and matrix remodeling.

Prolonged immobilization can delay the healing of a sprain, as it usually leads to muscle atrophy and weakness. Although prolonged immobilization can have a negative effect on recovery, a study in 1996 suggest that the use of bracing can improve healing by alleviating pain and stabilizing the injury to prevent further damage to the ligament or re-injury. When using a brace, it is necessary to ensure adequate blood flow to the extremity. Ultimately, the goal of functional rehabilitation is to return the patient to full daily activities while minimizing the risk of re-injury.

<doc id="390763" wikidata="Q157327" url="?curid=390763" title="Silverchair">
<text>Silverchair was an Australian rock band, which formed in 1992 as Innocent Criminals in Newcastle, New South Wales, with Daniel Johns on vocals and guitars, Ben Gillies on drums, and Chris Joannou on bass guitar. The group got their big break in mid-1994 when they won a national demo competition conducted by SBS TV show &quot;Nomad&quot; and ABC radio station Triple J. The band was signed by Murmur and were successful in Australia and internationally. Silverchair has sold over 10 million albums worldwide.

Silverchair have won more ARIA Music Awards than any other artist in history, earning 21 wins from 49 nominations. They also received six APRA Awards, with Johns winning three songwriting awards in 2008. All five of their studio albums debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart: &quot;Frogstomp&quot; (1995), &quot;Freak Show&quot; (1997), &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; (1999), &quot;Diorama&quot; (2002), and &quot;Young Modern&quot; (2007). Three singles reached the number-one slot on the related ARIA Singles Chart: &quot;Tomorrow&quot; (1994), &quot;Freak&quot; (1997), and &quot;Straight Lines&quot; (2007).

Silverchair&#x27;s alternative rock sound evolved throughout their career, with differing styles on specific albums growing more ambitious over the years, from grunge on their first two albums to later works displaying orchestral and art rock influences. The songwriting and singing of Johns had evolved steadily while the band had developed an increased element of complexity.

In 2003, following the release of &quot;Diorama&quot; the previous year, the band announced a hiatus, during which time members recorded with side projects the Dissociatives, the Mess Hall, and Tambalane. Silverchair reunited at the 2005 Wave Aid concerts. In 2007, they released their fifth album, &quot;Young Modern&quot;, and played the Across the Great Divide tour with contemporaries Powderfinger. In May 2011, Silverchair announced an indefinite hiatus.

== History ==
=== 1994–1997: Formation and early grunge releases ===
Silverchair&#x27;s founders, Ben Gillies and Daniel Johns, attended the same primary school in the Newcastle suburb of Merewether. At &quot;age 11 or 12&quot;, singer-guitarist Johns and drummer Gillies rapped over an electronic keyboard&#x27;s demo button under their first band name, The Silly Men. As teenagers, they started playing music together more prominently—in one class, they built a stage out of desks and played rap songs for their schoolmates. When they moved on to Newcastle High School, fellow student Chris Joannou joined the pair on bass guitar. In 1994, they formed Innocent Criminals with Tobin Finnane as a second guitarist, but he soon left. They played numerous shows around the Hunter Region in their early teens; their repertoire included cover versions of Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath. In 1994, Innocent Criminals entered YouthRock—a national competition for school-based bands—and placed first ahead of older competition. The band recorded demos of &quot;Acid Rain&quot;, &quot;Cicada&quot;, &quot;Pure Massacre&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; early in the year at Platinum Sound Studios.

In April, the band&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough came when they won a national competition called Pick Me, using their demo of &quot;Tomorrow&quot;. The competition was conducted by the SBS TV show &quot;Nomad&quot; and Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) alternative radio station Triple J. As part of the prize, Triple J recorded the song and ABC filmed a video, which was aired on 16 June. For the video&#x27;s broadcast, they had changed their name to Silverchair (styled as silverchair until 2002). In a 1994 interview with Melbourne magazine &quot;Buzz&quot;, the band claimed the name derived from a radio request for &quot;Sliver&quot; by Nirvana and &quot;Berlin Chair&quot; by You Am I being mixed up as Silver Chair. It was later revealed they were named for the C. S. Lewis–penned novel &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; from &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series. Johns later said of the fake story in a July 2007 interview: &quot;We can&#x27;t just say it&#x27;s the name of a book and [that] we were looking for a name and thought that sounded good, so we thought we&#x27;d come up with a story...&quot; Aside from Innocent Criminals, the band has used The George Costanza Trio and Short Elvis as aliases.

Following a bidding war between rival labels, Silverchair signed a three-album recording contract with Sony Music subsidiary Murmur Records. Initially, the group were managed by their parents. Sony A&amp;R manager John Watson, who was jointly responsible for signing the group, subsequently left the label to become their band manager. In September, their Triple J recording of &quot;Tomorrow&quot; was released as a four-track extended play. From late October, it spent six weeks at number-one on the ARIA Singles Chart. In 1995, a re-recorded version of &quot;Tomorrow&quot; (and a new video) was made for the United States market, becoming the most played song on US modern rock radio that year.

Silverchair&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Frogstomp&quot;, was recorded in nine days, with production by Kevin Shirley (Lime Spiders, Peter Wells) and released in March 1995. At the time of recording, the band members were 15 years old and still attending high school. &quot;Frogstomp&quot;&#x27;s lyrical concepts were fiction-based, drawing inspiration from television, hometown tragedies, and perceptions of the pain of friends. The album was well received: AllMusic and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated it in four and four-and-a-half stars, respectively, praising the intensity of the album, especially &quot;Tomorrow&quot;.

&quot;Frogstomp&quot; was a number-one album in Australia and New Zealand. It reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Top 10, making Silverchair the first Australian band to do so since INXS. It was certified as a US double-platinum album by the RIAA, triple-platinum in Canada by the CRIA, and multi-platinum in Australia. The album sold more than 4 million copies worldwide. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine called this album the &quot;last stand&quot; of grunge. As &quot;Frogstomp&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; continued to gain popularity through 1995, the group toured the US, where they supported Red Hot Chili Peppers in June, the Ramones in September, and played on the roof of Radio City Music Hall at the MTV Music Awards. In September 1995, during Silverchair&#x27;s tour in the United States, Johns was hit with a bottle of alcohol in Santa Monica, California while performing &quot;Israel&#x27;s Son&quot; and the injury required half a dozen stitches near his left eyebrow. In between touring, they continued their secondary education in Newcastle. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, the band won five awards out of nine nominations. To collect their awards on the night, they sent Josh Shirley, the young son of the album&#x27;s producer. At the ceremony, they performed Radio Birdman&#x27;s &quot;New Race&quot; with Tim Rogers (of You Am I); in 2019, Dan Condon of Double J rated this as one of the &quot;7 great performances from the history of the ARIA Awards.&quot; On 9 December 1995, Silverchair played &quot;Pure Massacre&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; on Saturday Night Live.

In a January 1996 murder case, the defendant counsel for Brian Bassett, 16, and Nicholaus McDonald, 18, of McCleary, Washington, claimed that the pair listened to &quot;Israel&#x27;s Son&quot;, from &quot;Frogstomp&quot;, which contributed to the 10 August 1995 murders of Bassett&#x27;s parents and a younger brother. McDonald&#x27;s lawyer cited the lyrics &quot;Hate is what I feel for you/I want you to know that I want you dead&quot; which were &quot;almost a script. They&#x27;re relevant to everything that happened&quot;. The band&#x27;s manager, Watson, issued a statement that they did not condone nor intend any such acts of violence. Prosecutors rejected the defence case and convinced the jury that the murder was committed to &quot;steal money and belongings and run off to California.&quot;

Silverchair began recording their second studio album, &quot;Freak Show&quot;, in May 1996 while experiencing the success of &quot;Frogstomp&quot; in Australia and the US. Produced by Nick Launay (Birthday Party, Models, Midnight Oil) and released in February 1997, the album reached number one in Australia and yielded three top-10 singles: &quot;Freak&quot;, &quot;Abuse Me&quot;, and &quot;Cemetery&quot;. Its fourth single, &quot;The Door&quot;, reached No. 25. The songs focused on the anger and backlash that the expectations of &quot;Frogstomp&quot; brought upon the band. &quot;Freak Show&quot; was certified gold in the US, 2× platinum in Australia, and global sales eventually exceeded 1.5 million copies.

=== 1997–2003: Artistic experimentation, critical and commercial success ===
By late 1997, the trio had completed their secondary education, and, from May 1998, they worked on their third album, &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;, with Launay producing again. It was released in March 1999 and peaked at the number-one position in Australia. Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane said, &quot;As well as being the band&#x27;s best album to date, it was universally acknowledged as one of the best albums of the year.&quot; The band originally intended to take a 12-month break, but in the end they decided to devote their time to making music. &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; provided three Australian top-20 singles: &quot;Anthem for the Year 2000&quot;, &quot;Ana&#x27;s Song (Open Fire)&quot; and &quot;Miss You Love&quot;; a fourth single, &quot;Paint Pastel Princess&quot;, did not reach the top 50. The albums charted well internationally: &quot;Freak Show&quot; reached No. 2 in Canada, and &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; reached No. 5. Both reached the top 40 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart. &quot;Abuse Me&quot; reached No. 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Modern Rock Tracks and Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks charts. &quot;Ana&#x27;s Song (Open Fire)&quot; peaked at No. 12 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks.

In 1999, Johns announced that he had developed the eating disorder anorexia nervosa due to anxiety. Johns noted that the lyrics to &quot;Ana&#x27;s Song (Open Fire)&quot; dealt with his disorder, where he would &quot;eat what he needed ... to stay awake.&quot; He revealed that his eating problems developed from the time of &quot;Freak Show&quot; and when &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; was written he &quot;hated music, really everything about it&quot;, but he felt that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t stop doing it; I felt like a slave to it.&quot; Johns sought therapy and medication but felt &quot;It&#x27;s easier for me to express it through music and lyrics&quot;. During the process of recording &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;, according to Gillies in an article by British publication &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;work&quot; was used to describe the band by Johns.

Silverchair added an auxiliary keyboardist, Sam Holloway (ex-Cordrazine), for the Neon Ballroom Tour. The US leg had the group playing with The Offspring and Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Silverchair&#x27;s tour of UK and European had The Living End as the support act. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Neva Chonin attributed their chart success to the album&#x27;s more &quot;mature&quot; sound. In Europe and South America it became the group&#x27;s most successful album to date. The group appeared at festivals in Reading and Edgefest, amongst others. Following the tour, the band announced that they would be taking a 12-month break. Their only live performance in 2000 was at the Falls Festival on New Year&#x27;s Eve. On 21 January 2001, the band played to 250,000 people at Rock in Rio, a show they described as the highlight of their career until that point.

After the release of &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;, Silverchair&#x27;s three-album contract with Sony Music had ended. The group eventually signed with Atlantic Records for North and South America, and they formed their own label with Watson, (distributed by EMI), for Australia and Asia. In November 2000, after the group had left the label, Sony issued &quot;The Best Of: Volume 1&quot; without the band&#x27;s involvement. Johns disavowed the compilation, saying, &quot;We thought about putting out ads in the street press to make people aware that we weren&#x27;t endorsing it, but that would have blown the whole thing out of proportion ... If people want to buy it, they can buy it[,] but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I was a silverchair fan.&quot;
In June 2001, Silverchair entered a studio in Sydney with producer David Bottrill (Tool, Peter Gabriel, King Crimson) to start work on their fourth album, &quot;Diorama&quot;. Johns formally assumed the role of a co-producer. The album name means &quot;a world within a world&quot;. Most tracks came from Johns&#x27; new-found method of writing material on a piano, a technique he developed during the band&#x27;s break after &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;.

In order to complete the vision for &quot;Diorama&quot;, several other musicians contributed to the album, including Van Dyke Parks, who provided orchestral arrangements to &quot;Tuna in the Brine&quot;, &quot;Luv Your Life&quot;, and &quot;Across the Night&quot;. Paul Mac (from Itch-E and Scratch-E) and Jim Moginie (from Midnight Oil) both on piano also collaborated with the band. While recording &quot;Diorama&quot;, Johns referred to himself as an artist, rather than simply being in a &quot;rock band&quot;. Upon its release, critics commented that the album was more artistic than previous works.

Early in December, the first single, &quot;The Greatest View&quot;, was released to Australian radio networks. Its physical release in January 2002 coincided with the band&#x27;s appearance on the Big Day Out tour. Early in 2002, Johns was diagnosed with reactive arthritis, which made it difficult for him to play the guitar, and subsequent performances supporting the album&#x27;s release were cancelled. In March 2002, &quot;Diorama&quot; was issued and topped the ARIA Albums Chart; it became their fourth number-one album and spent 50 weeks in the top 50.

Four singles were released from the album: &quot;The Greatest View&quot;, &quot;Without You&quot;, &quot;Luv Your Life&quot; and &quot;Across the Night&quot;; &quot;The Greatest View&quot; charted highest, reaching No. 3. In October, Silverchair were successful at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002, winning five awards, including &#x27;Best Rock Album&#x27; and &#x27;Best Group&#x27;, and &#x27;Producer of the Year&#x27; for Johns. The band played &quot;The Greatest View&quot; at the ceremony; the song was also nominated for &#x27;Best Video&#x27;. Two singles (and a related video) were nominated for further ARIA Awards in 2003. Following the 2002 ARIA Awards, the band announced their first indefinite hiatus. Johns said it was necessary &quot;given the fact the band were together for over a decade and yet were only, on average, 23 years old&quot;. From March to June 2003, Silverchair undertook the Across the Night Tour to perform &quot;Diorama&quot;. Their hometown performance on 19 April was recorded as &quot;Live from Faraway Stables&quot; for a 2-CD and 2-DVD release in November. After the tour finished in June, the group announced another indefinite hiatus.

=== 2003–2005: Extended break and side projects ===
In 2000, while also working with Silverchair, Johns and Mac released an internet-only EP, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Rock&quot;. In mid-2003, during Silverchair&#x27;s hiatus, the pair re-united and formed The Dissociatives, releasing a self-titled album in April 2004. The duo provided the theme music for the popular ABC-TV music quiz show &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; by reworking a 1966 Bee Gees hit of the same name. Johns also collaborated with then-wife Natalie Imbruglia on her &quot;Counting Down the Days&quot; album, released in April 2005.

Joannou worked with blues rock group The Mess Hall; he co-produced—with Matt Lovell—their six-track extended play &quot;Feeling Sideways&quot;, which was released in May 2003. The album was nominated for the ARIA Award for &#x27;Best Independent Release&#x27; in 2003. Joannou and Lovell co-produced The Mess Hall&#x27;s studio album &quot;Notes from a Ceiling&quot;, which was issued in June 2005. Joannou and Lovell received a nomination at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005 for &#x27;Producer of the Year&#x27;. In 2003, Gillies formed Tambalane with Wes Carr, initially as a song-writing project, and they released a self-titled album in 2005 and toured Australia.

The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami resulted in the WaveAid fundraising concert held in January 2005; Silverchair performed to help raise funds for aid organisations working in disaster-affected areas. As a result of WaveAid, the band decided to resume working together. Gillies explained the band&#x27;s reunion as due to a special &quot;chemistry&quot; between band members, telling the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;It only took us 15 years, but recently we&#x27;ve realised, &#x27;We&#x27;ve really got something special and we should just go for it.&#x27;&quot;

=== 2005–2011: Return from hiatus ===

After performing at Wave Aid, Silverchair reunited, and by late 2005 began preparations for their next studio album, &quot;Young Modern&quot;. Johns had written about 50 songs during the hiatus for a possible solo album or other project but decided to use them for Silverchair. In 2006, after five weeks&#x27; practice, the group demoed tracks in the Hunter Region before recording at Los Angeles&#x27; Seedy Underbelly Studios with Launay as producer. Parks again arranged orchestral tracks for the band—they travelled to Prague to record with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. The group also used Mac, Luke Steele (The Sleepy Jackson, Empire of the Sun) and Julian Hamilton (The Presets, The Dissociatives). Hamilton also co-wrote songs with Johns. Silverchair self-funded the album&#x27;s production to ease the pressures they faced when working with a record label.

The band toured extensively before releasing the album, performing at Homebake and numerous other shows. Both Mac and Hamilton joined the tour as auxiliary members providing keyboards. In October, they performed a cover of Midnight Oil&#x27;s 1981 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Be the One&quot; at the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 as part of that band&#x27;s induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame. During the performance, Johns spray-painted &quot;PG 4 PM&quot; (Peter Garrett for Prime Minister) on a stage wall, paying tribute to that band&#x27;s frontman, who was at that time a Federal Member of Parliament and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts.

&quot;Young Modern&quot; was released in March 2007, as was the first single, &quot;Straight Lines&quot;. Three more singles—&quot;Reflections of a Sound&quot;, &quot;If You Keep Losing Sleep&quot;, and &quot;Mind Reader&quot;—were released later. &quot;Young Modern&quot; became the fifth Silverchair album to top the ARIA Albums chart; they became the first artists to have five number-one albums on the ARIA Albums chart. &quot;Straight Lines&quot; also became the band&#x27;s third number-one single in Australia. In June 2007, Silverchair and fellow rock group Powderfinger announced the Across the Great Divide Tour. The tour promoted the efforts of Reconciliation Australia in mending the 17-year gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. Support acts on the tour were John Butler, Missy Higgins, Kev Carmody, Troy Cassar-Daley, Clare Bowditch and Deborah Conway.

&quot;Young Modern&quot; and &quot;Straight Lines&quot; each won three awards at the ARIA Music Awards of 2007, taking Silverchair&#x27;s total to 20. The group also won three APRA Awards for their song &quot;Straight Lines&quot;, including Songwriter of the Year, which Johns was awarded for a record third time. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008, Silverchair and Powderfinger each won Best Music DVD for &quot;Across the Great Divide&quot;, for Silverchair this was their 21st win from 49 nominations.

According to Silverchair&#x27;s website, as of June 2009, the group had begun work on the follow-up to &quot;Young Modern&quot;; they had spent three weeks recording in Australia with future sessions earmarked for later that year. No release date was set, but the band uploaded in-studio videos of them working on several tracks to their official website. In December, Johns called in to Triple J&#x27;s breakfast show, &quot;Robbie, Marieke and The Doctor&quot;, and discussed the band&#x27;s new album which they were working on in Newcastle. He told them, &quot;the main difference is there&#x27;s a lot of experimentation with instruments and synths... I think there&#x27;s only guitar on four songs out of fifty so far,&quot; but added the new material is &quot;surprisingly rocky given there&#x27;s no guitar.&quot; In April 2010, via the band&#x27;s website, Joannou announced they would perform two new songs called &quot;16&quot; and &quot;Machina Collecta&quot; at May&#x27;s Groovin&#x27; the Moo festival. He said work was progressing well and confirmed there was, as yet, no title for the proposed album and that they were simply referring to it as &quot;Album No. 6&quot;. The final concert of the festival was at Bunbury on 15 May. By year&#x27;s end, work on the album had stopped because each member had pursued other interests.

=== 2011–present: Breakup and &quot;indefinite hibernation&quot; ===
On 25 May 2011, Silverchair announced an indefinite hibernation:

&quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s music writer, Bernard Zuel, said the band&#x27;s use of &quot;indefinite hibernation&quot; was a way to soften the blow of the group&#x27;s break-up for fans; he expected future reunions and performances for worthy causes. By June, Gillies was in the final stages of about 12 months of working on his solo album, and he said that it was not a continuation of his earlier work with Tambalane. In October, Johns was working on the soundtrack for &quot;My Mind&#x27;s Own Melody&quot;—a short film. In May 2012, Johns recorded the new anthem for Qantas, titled &quot;Atlas&quot;. It is the first piece of commercial music Johns has composed. A remastered version of &quot;Frogstomp,&quot; which included bonus content, was released on 27 March 2015.

The members of Silverchair have occasionally stated that they have not ruled out a reunion. Gillies has said that there are plans to release a new Silverchair album, which was almost finished before the hiatus.

On 17 November 2017, the Silverchair tribute compilation album &quot;Spawn (Again): A Tribute to Silverchair&quot; was released by UNFD, with Johns saying he came to &quot;appreciate&quot; the experience. The album is composed of cover songs by Australian bands signed onto UNFD as a tribute to Silverchair, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their album &quot;Freak Show&quot;.

Speaking to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2018, Daniel Johns expressed his love for the band—and appreciation of what the band had produced—but said he had no desire to reform the band. In May 2020, a picture of Johns playing electric guitar appeared online, leading to the &quot;Newcastle Herald&quot; speculating that a reunion was possible. However, in October 2021, when Johns was interviewed by Carrie Bickmore on the Australian news-current affairs and talk show &quot;The Project&quot;, he once again affirmed that the band will not reunite, while also stating that he still plans to work on new music but has no intentions to perform live again. In a separate interview with Carrie Bickmore, Johns elaborated further, stating that during his time with Silverchair, he had been the victim of sustained verbal abuse from the public because of his association with the band. This impacted his mental health greatly. Johns was open to musical collaboration with his former bandmates but not as a continuation of Silverchair as a band.

On 5 February 2021, it was announced that Silverchair&#x27;s music would be distributed by Sony Music Entertainment Australia.

== Musical style ==
Silverchair are generally classified as an alternative rock and grunge band, although their loyalty to specific genres has changed as they have matured. Much of the band&#x27;s early grunge and post-grunge work was inspired by Nirvana, Tool, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Black Sabbath. According to Ian McFarlane, &quot;&quot;frogstomp&quot; captured the tempo of the times with its mix of Soundgarden/Pearl Jam/Bush post-grunge noise and teenage lyrical angst.&quot;

In their early years, the perceived stylistic similarities led to Silverchair being derisively dubbed as &#x27;Silverhighchair&#x27;, &#x27;not Soundgarden but &#x27; and &#x27;Nirvana in Pyjamas&#x27; by the Australian media. The latter is a sarcastic conflated reference to the band&#x27;s youth and the popular Australian children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Bananas in Pyjamas&quot;. McFarlane stated, &quot;&quot;Freak Show&quot; and tracks like &#x27;Freak&#x27; were firmly in Nirvana territory with a hint of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Eastern mysticism&quot;. Gillies noted that the band were inspired by the Seattle Sound, as well as The Beatles and The Doors, and were highly impressionable in their youth. Johns admitted that &quot;We were always influenced a lot by Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin[;] it just so happened that we weren&#x27;t very good at playing that style of music. So we were put in the whole grunge category because it was such a garage-y, heavy music term.&quot;

Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll felt that Johns &quot;had never intended to use his problems for inspiration, but in the end the music was the best way to unburden himself. &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; took six months to record. The album&#x27;s passion and musical sophistication proved to the world that silverchair were a force to be reckoned with&quot;. According to &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;, by three fellow journalists—John O&#x27;Donnell, Toby Creswell and Craig Mathieson—&quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;″s lead-in track, &quot;Emotion Sickness&quot;, described Johns&#x27; life in the 1990s and &quot;addressed [his] desire to move beyond the imitative sounds of Silverchair&#x27;s first two albums ... and create something new and original&quot;. &quot;Ana&#x27;s Song (Open Fire)&quot; directly focussed on his eating disorder; &quot;[it] became a hit all over the world and opened up for discussion the fact that males could also be affected by anorexia.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt &quot;Diorama&quot; &quot;was a shockingly creative and impressive step forward that showed the band shedding its grunge past and adding horns, strings, and mature lyrics to its arsenal.&quot; Fellow AllMusic reviewer Bradley Torreano noted that &quot;they somehow kept going and kept improving ... Silverchair has grown up and put together a fine mix of orchestral pop and rock on Diorama.&quot; Bernard Zuel described how the &quot;Diorama&quot; concert tour marked a move from hard rock towards art rock: &quot;they stepped out of the arenas and barns and &#x27;got classy&#x27; ... finally having admitted to harbouring artistic ambition (a very un-Australian band thing to do), they&#x27;ve proved they have the ability&quot;.

In writing &quot;Young Modern&quot;, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band&#x27;s overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning &quot;Straight Lines&quot;. Joannou believed that &quot;Young Modern&quot; was simpler than &quot;Diorama&quot; but &quot;still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements&quot;. He said that much of the band&#x27;s success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.

Gillies notes that Silverchair will often &quot;run the risk of losing fans&quot; with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in &quot;Diorama&quot; and &quot;Young Modern&quot;. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact &quot;that we haven&#x27;t been pigeonholed, and people really don&#x27;t know what to expect&quot; as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says that he and the band &quot;appreciate what we&#x27;ve achieved and what we&#x27;ve got&quot; in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards, with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony.

=== Reception ===
&quot;Frogstomp&quot; was described as similar to Nirvana and Pearl Jam; Erlewine noted that it followed in &quot;the alternative rock tradition&quot; of those bands. Erlewine also stated that &quot;their songwriting abilities aren&#x27;t as strong&quot; as those of their peers. Contrarily, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; claimed that the band had risen above their peers, applauding Johns&#x27; &quot;ragged vocals&quot;. &quot;Herald Sun&quot; journalist Nue Te Koha praised &quot;Frogstomp&quot; for &quot;breaking the drought of Australian music making an impact overseas&quot;. However, he felt &quot;It is highly debatable whether the three teens have gone to the world with a new sound or something identifiably Australian ... Silverchair&#x27;s image and sound are blatantly ... Nirvana meets Pearl Jam&quot;. Nimmervoll disputed Te Koha&#x27;s view, &quot;It&#x27;s not original, it&#x27;s not Australian. Bah, humbug ... It&#x27;s just as well Britain didn&#x27;t say the same thing when The Beatles reinvented American R&amp;B&quot;.

&quot;Freak Show&quot; saw the band show more of their own musical style rather than copying others, and thus received more praise for its songwriting than its predecessor. Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Sandy Masuo described the lyrics as &quot;moving&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot;. Johns&#x27; vocal delivery was complimented: &quot;[his] bittersweet, crackly voice tops the ample power chordage ... [he] hits shivery, emotional notes that convey both sweet idealism and disappointment&quot;. Zuel felt that with this album, the band &quot;have outgrown the jokes, predictions and their own understated teenage ambitions to find they have become (gasp!) career musicians.&quot;

In &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (2010), their third album, &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;, was placed at No. 25, according to its authors. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; approved of the further advancement in &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;, commenting on &quot;plush strings on these adult arrangements&quot;. There were once again significant advancements in songwriting; Johns was described as &quot;furious, motivated, and all grown up&quot;. However, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the album seemed confused, commenting that Silverchair &quot;can&#x27;t decide what they want to do&quot; with their music. Meanwhile, &quot;Diorama&quot; was seen as an extension of the band&#x27;s originality, with its &quot;[h]eavy orchestration, unpredictable melodic shifts and a whimsical pop sensibility&quot;. According to PopMatters&#x27; Nikki Tranter, the album stood out in an otherwise dull Australian music market.

AllMusic&#x27;s Clayton Bolger described &quot;Young Modern&quot; as an improvement by the band, praising &quot;catchy melodic hooks, inspired lyrical themes, and stunning string arrangements&quot;. He claimed the album was the pinnacle of the band&#x27;s development. PopMatters&#x27; Nick Pearson saw the opposite, claiming that &quot;[o]nce you reach the level of intellectual maturity where you can tell the difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair&quot;. Pearson called the album an attempt to secure a safer territory and assure sales, after the success of past works, calling it more boring than its predecessors. Other reviewers noted influences from cult British band XTC.

In July 2009, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; was voted number 33 by the Australian public in Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 of all time. As of January 2018, the group have sold 9 million albums worldwide. At the annual ARIA Music Awards, Silverchair holds the record for the most nominated artist, with 49, and the most awards won, with 21. Their breakthrough year was in 1995, when they won five out of nine nominations, including &#x27;Best New Talent&#x27;, and &#x27;Breakthrough Artist&#x27; for both album and single categories. Their most successful year was at the 2007 ceremony, where they won six of eight nominations. In November 2020, the 1994 EP recording of the song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; was inducted into the NFSA (National Film and Sound Archive of Australia).

<doc id="390766" wikidata="Q72579" url="?curid=390766" title="Samuel Goldwyn">
<text>Samuel Goldwyn (; born Szmuel Gelbfisz; ; August 27, 1882 (claimed but most likely July 1879) January 31, 1974), also known as Samuel Goldfish, was a Polish-born American film producer and pioneer in the American film industry, who produced Hollywood&#x27;s first major motion picture. He was best known for being the founding contributor and executive of several motion picture studios in Hollywood. He was awarded the 1973 Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award (1947) and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (1958).

==Early life==
Goldwyn was likely born in July 1879, although he claimed his birthday to be August 27, 1882. He was born as Szmuel Gelbfisz in Warsaw to Hasidic Jewish parents, Aaron Dawid Gelbfisz, a peddler, and his wife, Hanna Frymet (&quot;née&quot; Fiszhaut).

He left Warsaw penniless after his father&#x27;s death and made his way to Hamburg. There he stayed with acquaintances of his family where he trained as a glove maker. On November 26, 1898, Gelbfisz left Hamburg for Birmingham, England, where he remained with relatives for six weeks under the name Samuel Goldfish. On January 4, 1899, he sailed from Liverpool, arrived in Philadelphia on January 19, and went to New York. He found work in upstate Gloversville, New York in the bustling glove business. Soon, his marketing skills made him a very successful salesman at the Elite Glove Company. After four years as vice-president of sales, he moved to New York City and settled at 10 West 61st Street.

==Paramount==
In 1913, Goldwyn, along with his brother-in-law Jesse L. Lasky, Cecil B. DeMille, and Arthur Friend formed a partnership, The Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, to produce feature-length motion pictures. Film rights for a stage play, &quot;The Squaw Man&quot;, were purchased for $4,000 and Dustin Farnum was hired for the leading role. Shooting for the first feature film made in Hollywood began on December 29, 1913.

In 1914, Paramount was a film exchange and exhibition corporation headed by W. W. Hodkinson. Looking for more movies to distribute, Paramount signed a contract with the Lasky Company on 1 June 1914 to supply 36 films per year. One of Paramount&#x27;s other suppliers was Adolph Zukor&#x27;s Famous Players Company. The two companies merged on 28 June 1916, forming the Famous Players–Lasky Corporation. Zukor had been quietly buying Paramount stock, and two weeks before the merger, became president of Paramount Pictures Corporation and had Hodkinson replaced with Hiram Abrams, a Zukor associate.

With the merger, Zukor became president of Paramount and Famous Players–Lasky, Goldwyn was named chairman of the board of Famous Players–Lasky, and Jesse Lasky was the first vice-president. After a series of conflicts with Zukor, Goldwyn resigned as chairman, and as a member of the executive committee on September 14, 1916. Goldwyn was no longer an active member of management, although he still owned stock and was a member of the board of directors. Famous Players–Lasky later became part of Paramount Pictures Corporation, and Paramount became one of Hollywood&#x27;s major studios.

==Goldwyn Pictures==
In 1916, Goldwyn partnered with Broadway producers Edgar and Archibald Selwyn, using a combination of both names to call their film-making enterprise Goldwyn Pictures. Seeing an opportunity, he had his name legally changed to Samuel Goldwyn in December 1918 and used this name for the rest of his life. Goldwyn Pictures proved successful, but it is their &quot;Leo the Lion&quot; trademark for which the company is remembered today.

After personality clashes, Samuel Goldwyn left the company in 1922. Godsol became chairman of the board and President of Goldwyn Pictures in 1922. On April 10, 1924, Goldwyn Pictures was acquired by Marcus Loew and merged into his Metro Pictures Corporation, becoming Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Despite including his name, Samuel Goldwyn was never connected with ownership, management, or production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

==Samuel Goldwyn Productions==
Before the sale and merger of Goldwyn Pictures in April 1924, Goldwyn had established Samuel Goldwyn Productions in 1923 as a production-only operation (with no distribution arm). Their first feature was &quot;Potash and Perlmutter&quot;, released in September 1923 through First National Pictures. Some of the early productions bear the name &quot;Howard Productions&quot;, named for Goldwyn&#x27;s wife, Frances.

For 35 years, Goldwyn built a reputation in filmmaking and developed an eye for finding the talent for making films. William Wyler directed many of his most celebrated productions, and he hired writers such as Ben Hecht, Sidney Howard, Dorothy Parker, and Lillian Hellman. (According to legend, at a heated story conference, Goldwyn scolded someone—in most accounts, Mrs. Parker, who recalled he had once been a glove maker—who responded to him, &quot;Don&#x27;t you point that finger at me. I knew it when it had a thimble on it!&quot;)

Goldwyn made numerous films during that time and reigned as Hollywood&#x27;s most successful independent producer. Many of his films were forgettable; his collaboration with John Ford, however, resulted in a Best Picture Oscar nomination for &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; (1931). Goldwyn and Ford had another successful collaboration six years later with &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1937). William Wyler was responsible for most of Goldwyn&#x27;s highly lauded films, with Best Picture Oscar nominations for &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1936), &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937), &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939), &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946). Leading actors in several Goldwyn films, especially those directed by Wyler, were also Oscar-nominated for their performances. Throughout the 1930s, Goldwyn released all his films through United Artists; beginning in 1941 and continuing nearly to the end of his career, Goldwyn&#x27;s films were distributed by RKO Pictures.

==Oscar triumph and later years==
In 1946, the year he was honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, Goldwyn&#x27;s drama, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, starring Myrna Loy, Fredric March, Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews, won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In the 1950s, Samuel Goldwyn turned to make several musicals including &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot; (1952), his last with Danny Kaye, with whom he had made many others, and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955) starring Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, Frank Sinatra, and Vivian Blaine, which was based on the successful Broadway musical. This was the only independent film that Goldwyn released through MGM.

In his final film, Samuel Goldwyn brought together African-American actors Sidney Poitier, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis Jr. and Pearl Bailey in a film rendition of the George Gershwin opera, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1959). Released by Columbia Pictures, the film was nominated for three Oscars but won only one for Best Original Score. It was also a critical and financial failure, and the Gershwin family reportedly disliked the film and eventually pulled it from distribution. The film turned the opera into an operetta with spoken dialogue in between the musical numbers. Its reception was a major disappointment for Goldwyn, who, according to biographer Arthur Marx, saw it as his crowning glory and had wanted to film &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; since he first saw it onstage in 1935.

Goldwyn&#x27;s house at 1200 Laurel Lane in Beverly Hills was completed in 1934, designed by Douglas Honnold and George Vernon Russell. The Goldwyns hosted frequent social events at the house.

==Awards==
* In 1957, Goldwyn was awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his outstanding contributions to humanitarian causes.
* On March 27, 1971, Goldwyn was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon.

==Marriages==
In 1910, Goldwyn married Blanche Lasky, a sister of Jesse L. Lasky. The marriage produced a daughter. The couple divorced in 1915. In 1925, he married actress Frances Howard, to whom he remained married for the rest of his life. Their son, Samuel Goldwyn Jr., eventually joined his father in the business.

Despite his marriages, Samuel Goldwyn was known as a ladies&#x27; man in social circles. Goldwyn Girl Jean Howard was quoted saying, &quot;Sam Goldwyn was not a fellow to make a pass in public; he had too much taste for that,&quot; but his dalliances were many, even as his wife Frances Howard turned a blind eye.

==Death==
Goldwyn died of heart failure at his home in Los Angeles in 1974 at 91 or 94 if born in 1879. In the 1980s, the Samuel Goldwyn Studio was sold to Warner Bros. There is a theater named after him in Beverly Hills and he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1631 Vine Street for his contributions to motion pictures on February 8, 1960.

==Descendants and relations==
===Grandchildren===
Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s grandchildren include:
* Francis Goldwyn, founder of the Manhattan Toy Company and managing member of Quorum Associates
* Tony Goldwyn, actor, producer, and director, best known for starring as President Fitzgerald Grant III in the TV series &quot;Scandal&quot;
* John Goldwyn, film producer
* Peter Goldwyn, the current president of Samuel Goldwyn Films
* Catherine Goldwyn, creator of Sound Art, a non-profit that teaches popular music all over Los Angeles
* Liz Goldwyn, with a film on HBO called &quot;Pretty Things&quot;, featuring interviews with queens from the heyday of American burlesque; her book, an extension of the documentary titled &quot;Pretty Things: The Last Generation of American Burlesque Queens&quot;, was published in 2006 by HarperCollins
* Rebecca Goldwyn (August 15, 1955September 1, 1955)

===Nephew===
Goldwyn&#x27;s relatives include Fred Lebensold, an award-winning architect (best known as the designer of multiple concert halls in Canada and the United States). Fred was the son of Manya Lebensold, Sam&#x27;s younger sister, who was murdered in the Holocaust, despite the best efforts of her brothers Sam and Ben in 1939–40 to extricate her from the Warsaw Ghetto.

==The Samuel Goldwyn Foundation==
Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s will created a multimillion-dollar charitable foundation in his name. Among other endeavors, the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation funds the Samuel Goldwyn Writing Awards, provides construction funds for the Frances Howard Goldwyn Hollywood Regional Library, and provides ongoing funding for the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital.

==The Samuel Goldwyn Company==

Several years after the senior Goldwyn&#x27;s death, his son, Samuel Jr., initiated an independent film and television distribution company dedicated to preserving the integrity of Goldwyn&#x27;s ambitions and work. The company&#x27;s assets were later acquired by Orion Pictures, and in 1997, passed on to Orion&#x27;s parent company, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Several years later, the Samuel Goldwyn Jr. Family Trust and Warner Bros. acquired the rights to all the Goldwyn-produced films except &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, which was returned to MGM subsidiary United Artists.

==Goldwynisms==
Goldwyn was also known for his malapropisms, paradoxes, and other speech errors called &#x27;Goldwynisms&#x27; (&quot;a humorous statement or phrase resulting from the use of incongruous or contradictory words, situations, idioms, etc.&quot;) and was frequently quoted. For example, he was reported to have said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think anybody should write his autobiography until after he&#x27;s dead.&quot; and &quot;Include me out.&quot; Some famous Goldwyn quotations are misattributions. For example, the statement attributed to Goldwyn that &quot;a verbal contract isn&#x27;t worth the paper it&#x27;s written on&quot; is a well-documented misreporting of an actual quote praising the trustworthiness of a colleague: &quot;His verbal contract is worth more than the paper it&#x27;s written on&quot;. The identity of the colleague is variously reported as Joseph M. Schenck or Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Goldwyn himself was reportedly aware of—and pleased by—the misattribution.

Upon being told that a book he had purchased for filming, &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, couldn&#x27;t be filmed because it was about lesbians, he reportedly replied: &quot;That&#x27;s all right, we&#x27;ll make them Hungarians.&quot; The same story was told about the 1934 rights to &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; with the response &quot;That&#x27;s okay; we&#x27;ll turn them into Armenians.&quot;

In the Grateful Dead&#x27;s &quot;Scarlet Begonias&quot;, the line &quot;I ain&#x27;t often right, but I&#x27;ve never been wrong&quot; appears in the bridge. This is similar to Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m willing to admit that I may not always be right, but I am never wrong.&quot;

<doc id="390767" wikidata="Q856736" url="?curid=390767" title="Foreign accent syndrome">
<text>Foreign accent syndrome is a rare medical condition in which patients develop speech patterns that are perceived as a foreign accent that is different from their native accent, without having acquired it in the perceived accent&#x27;s place of origin.

Foreign accent syndrome usually results from a stroke, but can also develop from head trauma, migraines or developmental problems. The condition might occur due to lesions in the speech production network of the brain, or may also be considered a neuropsychiatric condition. The condition was first reported in 1907, and between 1941 and 2009 there were 62 recorded cases.

Its symptoms result from distorted articulatory planning and coordination processes, and although popular news articles commonly attempt to identify the closest regional accent, speakers with foreign accent syndrome acquire neither a specific foreign accent nor any additional fluency in a foreign language. There has been no verified case where a patient&#x27;s foreign language skills have improved after a brain injury.

== Signs and symptoms ==
To the untrained ear, those with the syndrome sound as though they speak their native languages with a foreign accent; for example, an American native speaker of American English might sound as though they spoke with a south-eastern British English accent or a native English speaker from Britain might speak with a New York accent. Contrary to popular belief, individuals with FAS do not exhibit their accent without any effort. Instead, these individuals feel as if they have a speech disorder. More recently, there is mounting evidence that the cerebellum, which controls motor function, may be crucially involved in some cases of foreign accent syndrome, reinforcing the notion that speech pattern alteration is mechanical and thus non-specific.

Generally, FAS is not a persisting disorder; it is a temporary stage in recovery from stroke or trauma or potentially a stage of deterioration. FAS mainly affects speech at a segmental or prosodic level. Vowels are more likely to be affected than consonants. Vowel errors include an increase in vowel tensing, monophthongization of diphthongs, and vowel fronting and raising. There is evidence of both vowel shortening and lengthening. Consonantal anomalies include cases of changes in articulation, manner, and voicing. 

On a suprasegmental level, there are changes in intonation and pitch, such as monotonous intonation or exaggerations in pitch height and range. There are also difficulties in using stress accents to indicate pragmatics and meaning. There is a tendency for FAS patients to switch to syllable-timed prosody when their native language is stress-timed. This perception could be due to changes in syllable durations, and the addition of epenthetic vowels.

FAS has many similarities to apraxia of speech (AoS), which is another motor speech disorder. Some researchers think that FAS is a mild form of AoS because they are both caused by similar lesions in the brain. FAS differs from AoS in that FAS patients have more control over their speech deficits and their &quot;foreign accent&quot; is a form of compensation for their speech problems. Because there are relatively few differences in the symptoms of FAS and AoS, a listener&#x27;s perception of the affected speech plays a large role in diagnosis of FAS rather than AoS. The listener has to be familiar with a foreign accent in order to attribute it to the affected speech of someone with FAS.

The perception of a foreign accent is likely to be a case of pareidolia on the part of the listener. Nick Miller, Professor of Motor Speech Disorders at Newcastle University has explained: &quot;The notion that sufferers speak in a foreign language is something that is in the ear of the listener, rather than the mouth of the speaker. It is simply that the rhythm and pronunciation of speech has changed.&quot;

== Causes and diagnosis == 
Foreign accent syndrome is more commonly pronounced in females than it is in males. In a meta-analysis of 112 patients with FAS, 97% were adults, and 67% were female. The typical age range for this disease is around 25–49 years of age. Only in 12.5% of the cases did the patients have previous exposure to the accent that they later seemed to develop due to FAS.

The majority of FAS patients develop FAS due to a stroke, but it can also develop as a result of developmental or psychological disorders, trauma, or tumors. Of the patients with neurological damage, the majority had a lesion in the supratentorial left hemisphere. Lesions primarily affected the: premotor cortex, motor cortex, basal ganglia or Broca&#x27;s area. Lesions are also seen in the cerebellum, which projects to the previous areas. Right hemisphere damage rarely causes FAS. The majority of patients with FAS usually present other speech disorders, such as: mutism, aphasia, dysarthria, agrammatism and apraxia of speech.

Neurolinguist Harry Whitaker first coined the term foreign accent syndrome in 1982. He originally proposed some criteria that must be present in order to diagnose someone with FAS; they must be monolingual, they must have damage to their central nervous system that affects their speech, and their speech must be perceived as subjectively sounding foreign by themselves or clinicians. One problem with Whitaker&#x27;s criteria is that they are based primarily on subjectivity, and therefore acoustic phonetic measurements are rarely used to diagnose FAS.

Since this syndrome is very rare, it takes a multidisciplinary team to evaluate the syndrome and diagnose it, including: speech-language pathologists, neurolinguists, neurologists, neuropsychologists and psychologists. In 2010, linguist Jo Verhoeven and neurolinguist Peter Mariën identified several subtypes of foreign accent syndrome. They described a neurogenic, developmental, psychogenic and mixed variant. Neurogenic FAS is the term used when FAS occurs after central nervous system damage. Developmental FAS is used when the accent is perceptible as of an early age, e.g. children who have always spoken with an accent. 

Psychogenic FAS is used when FAS is psychologically induced, associated with psychiatric disorder or clear psychiatric traits. The term mixed FAS is used when patients develop the disorder after neurological damage, but the accent change has such a profound impact on the self-perception and identity that they will modify or enhance the accent to make it fit with the new persona.

Diagnosis, up until today, is generally purely perceptually based. However, in order to find out what subtype the patient has, complementary investigations are necessary. This differentiation is necessary for the clinician to allow for correct therapeutic guidance. Psychological evaluations may be performed in order to rule out any psychiatric condition that may be causing the change in speech, as well as tests to assess reading, writing, and language comprehension in order to identify comorbid disorders. 

One of the symptoms of this syndrome is that the patient moves their tongue or jaw differently while speaking, which creates a different sound, so a recording of the speech pattern is done in order to analyze it. Often, images of the brain are taken with MRI, CT, SPECT or PET scans. This is done to see if there is structural and or functional damage in the areas of the brain that control speech and/or rhythm and melody of speech. Electroencephalography is sometimes performed to investigate whether there are disturbances at the electrophysiological level.

Treatment involves intense speech therapy. Methods such as oromotor exercises, using mirrors, targeting phonetic awareness, reading lists and texts, and using electropalatography are all methods that have been used in the past. Treatment should be developed on a patient by patient basis. About a quarter of FAS patients go through remission after treatment.

==History==
The condition was first described in 1907 by the French neurologist Pierre Marie, and another early case was reported in a Czechoslovak study in 1919, conducted by German internist (1859–1945). Other well-known cases of the syndrome include one that occurred in Norway in 1941 after a young woman, Astrid L., suffered a head injury from shrapnel during an air-raid. After apparently recovering from the injury, she was left with what sounded like a strong German accent and was shunned by her fellow Norwegians.

== Society and culture ==
Cases of foreign accent syndrome often receive significant media coverage, and cases have been reported in the popular media as resulting from various causes including stroke, allergic reaction, physical injury, and migraine. A woman with foreign accent syndrome was featured on both &quot;Inside Edition&quot; and Discovery Health Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mystery ER&quot; in October 2008, and in September 2013 the BBC published an hour-long documentary about Sarah Colwill, a woman from Devon, whose &quot;Chinese&quot; foreign accent syndrome resulted from a severe migraine. 

In 2016, a Texas woman, Lisa Alamia, was diagnosed with foreign accent syndrome when, following a jaw surgery, she developed what sounded like a British accent. Ellen Spencer, a woman from Indiana who has foreign accent syndrome, was interviewed on the American public radio show &quot;Snap Judgment&quot;. The British singer George Michael reported briefly speaking in a West Country accent following his recovery from a three-week long coma in 2012.

== Potential treatments ==
FAS is a very rare disorder. Likewise, there are not very many proposed treatments. Two that may provide relief to patients with FAS in the future include mastery of musical skills and &quot;tongue reading&quot;.

In terms of mastery of music skills, research by Christiner and Reiterer suggests that musicians, both instrumental and vocal, are better at imitating foreign accents than non-musicians. Vocalists are further better than instrumentalists at this task. In this way, individuals with FAS might be able to reimitate their original, lost native accents more easily if they master a musical – especially vocal – skill.

Pursuing this further, another set of researchers, Banks et al. investigated the role of hearing a foreign accent versus hearing and seeing someone use a foreign accent and which of these may be better for helping an individual replicate a foreign accent. Contrary to the researcher&#x27;s predictions, &quot;no differences were found in perceptual gains between the two modalities.&quot; By contrast, a method that did seem to improve learning of non-native speech sounds was &quot;real-time visual feedback of tongue movements with an interactive 3D visualization system based on electromagnetic articulography.&quot;

<text>Hjalmar Schacht (born Horace Greeley Hjalmar Schacht; 22 January 1877 – 3 June 1970, ) was a German economist, banker, politician, and co-founder of the German Democratic Party. He served as the Currency Commissioner and President of the Reichsbank under the Weimar Republic. He was a fierce critic of his country&#x27;s post-World War I reparations obligations. He was also central in helping create the group of German industrialists and landowners that pushed Hindenburg to appoint the first NSDAP-led government.

He served in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s government as President of the Central Bank (&quot;Reichsbank&quot;) 1933–1939 and as Minister of Economics (August 1934 – November 1937).

While Schacht was for a time feted for his role in the German &quot;economic miracle&quot;, he opposed elements of Hitler&#x27;s policy of German re-armament insofar as it violated the Treaty of Versailles and (in his view) disrupted the German economy. His views in this regard led Schacht to clash with Hitler and most notably with Hermann Göring. He resigned as President of the Reichsbank in January 1939. He remained as a Minister-without-portfolio, and received the same salary, until he left the government in January 1943.

In 1944, Schacht was arrested by the Gestapo following the assassination attempt on Hitler on 20 July 1944 because he allegedly had contact with the assassins. Subsequently, he was interned in the concentration camps and later at Flossenbürg. In the final days of the war, he was one of the 139 special and clan prisoners who were transported by the SS from Dachau to South Tyrol. This location is within the area named by Himmler the &quot;Alpine Fortress&quot;, and it is speculated that the purpose of the prisoner transport was the intent of holding hostages. They were freed in Niederdorf, South Tyrol, in Italy, on 30 April 1945.

Schacht was tried at Nuremberg, but was acquitted despite Soviet objections. Later, a German denazification tribunal sentenced him to eight years of hard labour, which was also overturned on appeal.

==Early life and career==
Schacht was born in Tingleff, Prussia, German Empire (now in Denmark) to William Leonhard Ludwig Maximillian Schacht and Baroness Constanze Justine Sophie von Eggers, a native of Denmark. His parents, who had spent years in the United States, originally decided on the name Horace Greeley Schacht, in honor of the American journalist Horace Greeley. However, they yielded to the insistence of the Schacht family grandmother, who firmly believed the child&#x27;s given name should be Danish. After completing his &quot;Abitur&quot; at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums, Schacht studied medicine, philology, political science, and finance at the Universities of Munich, Leipzig, Berlin, Paris and Kiel before earning a doctorate at Kiel in 1899 – his thesis was on mercantilism.

He joined the Dresdner Bank in 1903. In 1905, while on a business trip to the United States with board members of the Dresdner Bank, Schacht met the famous American banker J. P. Morgan, as well as U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt. He became deputy director of the Dresdner Bank from 1908 to 1915. He was then a board member of the for the next seven years, until 1922, and after its merger with the Darmstädter und Nationalbank (Danatbank), a board member of the Danatbank.

Schacht was a freemason, having joined the lodge &quot;Urania zur Unsterblichkeit&quot; in 1908.

During the First World War, Schacht was assigned to the staff of General Karl von Lumm (1864–1930), the Banking Commissioner for German-occupied Belgium, to organize the financing of Germany&#x27;s purchases in Belgium. He was summarily dismissed by General von Lumm when it was discovered that he had used his previous employer, the Dresdner Bank, to channel the note remittances for nearly 500 million francs of Belgian national bonds destined to pay for the requisitions.

After Schacht&#x27;s dismissal from public service, he had another brief stint at the Dresdner Bank, and then various positions at other banks. In 1923, Schacht applied and was rejected for the position of head of the Reichsbank, largely as a result of his dismissal from Lumm&#x27;s service.

During the German Revolution of 1918–1919 Schacht became a &quot;Vernunftrepublikaner&quot; (a supporter of the Republic by reason rather than conviction) who had reservations over the parliamentary democratic system of the new Weimar Republic but supported it anyway for pragmatic reasons. He helped found the left-liberal German Democratic Party (DDP), which took a leading role in the governing Weimar Coalition. However, Schacht later became an ally of Gustav Stresemann, the leader of the center-right German People&#x27;s Party (DVP).

==Rise to President of the Reichsbank==

Despite the blemish on his record from his service with von Lumm, on 12 November 1923, Schacht became currency commissioner for the Weimar Republic and participated in the introduction of the Rentenmark, a new currency the value of which was based on a mortgage on all of the properties in Germany. Germany entered into a brief period where it had two separate currencies: the Reichsmark managed by Rudolf Havenstein, President of the Reichsbank, and the newly created Rentenmark managed by Schacht. Havenstein died on 20 November 1923.

On 22 December 1923, after Schacht&#x27;s economic policies had helped battle German hyperinflation and stabilize the German Reichsmark (Helfferich Plan), he was appointed President of the Reichsbank at the requests of president Friedrich Ebert and Chancellor Gustav Stresemann.

In 1926, Schacht provided funds for the formation of IG Farben. He collaborated with other prominent economists to form the 1929 Young Plan to modify the way that war reparations were paid after Germany incurred large foreign debts under the Dawes Plan. In December 1929, he caused the fall of the Finance Minister Rudolf Hilferding by imposing upon the government his conditions for obtaining a loan. After modifications by Hermann Müller&#x27;s government to the Young Plan during the Second Conference of The Hague (January 1930), he resigned as Reichsbank president on 7 March 1930. During 1930, Schacht campaigned against the war reparations requirement in the United States.

Schacht became a friend of the Governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, both men belonging to the Anglo-German Fellowship and the Bank for International Settlements. Norman was so close to the Schacht family that he was godfather to one of Schacht&#x27;s grandchildren.

==Involvement with the NSDAP (Nazi Party) and government==
By 1926, Schacht had left the shrinking DDP and began increasingly lending his support to the Nazi Party (NSDAP). He became disillusioned with Stresemann&#x27;s policies after he believed that closer relations with the United States were failing to provide economic benefits, and after his efforts to negotiate a rapprochement with the United Kingdom by pegging the Reichsmark to the pound sterling failed. Beginning in 1929 he increasingly criticized German foreign and financial policy since 1924 and demanded the restoration of Germany&#x27;s former eastern territories and overseas colonies. Schacht became closer to the Nazis between 1930 and 1932.
Though never a member of the NSDAP, Schacht helped to raise funds for the party after meeting with Adolf Hitler. Close for a short time to Heinrich Brüning&#x27;s government, Schacht shifted to the right by entering the Harzburg Front in October 1931.

Schacht&#x27;s disillusionment with the existing Weimar government did not indicate a particular shift in his overall philosophy, but rather arose primarily out of two issues:

* his objection to the inclusion of Social Democratic Party elements in the government, and the effect of their various construction and job-creation projects on public expenditures and borrowings (and the consequent undermining of the government&#x27;s anti-inflation efforts);
* his desire to see Germany retake its place on the international stage, and his recognition that &quot;as the powers became more involved in their own economic problems in 1931 and 1932 ... a strong government based on a broad national movement could use the existing conditions to regain Germany&#x27;s sovereignty and equality as a world power.&quot;

Schacht believed that if the German government was ever to commence a wholesale reindustrialization and rearmament in spite of the restrictions imposed by Germany&#x27;s treaty obligations, it would have to be during a period lacking clear international consensus among the Great Powers.

After the November 1932 elections, in which the NSDAP saw its vote share fall by four percentage points, Schacht and Wilhelm Keppler organized a petition of industrial and financial leaders, the &quot;Industrielleneingabe&quot; (Industrial petition), requesting president Paul Von Hindenburg to appoint Adolf Hitler as Chancellor. After Hitler took power in January 1933, Schacht won re-appointment as Reichsbank president on 17 March.
On 2 August 1934, when Reich and Prussian Minister of Economics Kurt Schmitt went on an extended medical leave of absence, Hitler provisionally appointed Schacht to take over the running of the ministries. The appointment was made permanent on 31 January 1935, after Schmitt formally resigned. Schacht supported public-works programs, most notably the construction of &quot;autobahnen&quot; (highways) to attempt to alleviate unemployment – policies which had been instituted in Germany by Kurt von Schleicher&#x27;s government in late 1932, and had in turn influenced Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal in the United States. But years later, Roosevelt seemed to &quot;enjoy&quot; recalling how Dr. Schacht was &quot;weeping on his [FDR&#x27;s] desk about his poor country.&quot; He also introduced the &quot;New Plan&quot;, Germany&#x27;s attempt to achieve economic &quot;autarky&quot;, in September 1934. Germany had accrued a massive foreign currency deficit during the Great Depression, which continued into the early years of Nazi rule. Schacht negotiated several trade agreements with countries in South America and southeastern Europe, under which Germany would continue to receive raw materials, but would pay in Reichsmarks. This ensured that the deficit would not get any worse, while allowing the German government to deal with the gap which had already developed. Schacht also found an innovative solution to the problem of the government deficit by using mefo bills.

Schacht also was made a member of the Academy for German Law. He was appointed General Plenipotentiary for the War Economy in May 1935 by provision of the Reich Defense Law of 21 May 1935 and was awarded honorary membership in the NSDAP and the Golden Party Badge in January 1937.

Schacht disagreed with what he called &quot;unlawful activities&quot; against Germany&#x27;s Jewish minority and in August 1935 made a speech denouncing Julius Streicher and Streicher&#x27;s writing in the Nazi newspaper &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;.
During the economic crisis of 1935–36, Schacht, together with the Price Commissioner Dr. Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, helped lead the &quot;free-market&quot; faction in the German government. They urged Hitler to reduce military spending, turn away from autarkic and protectionist policies, and reduce state control in the economy. Schacht and Goerdeler were opposed by a faction centering on Hermann Göring. Göring was appointed &quot;Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan&quot; on 18 October 1936, with broad powers that conflicted with Schacht&#x27;s authority. Schacht objected to continued high military spending, which he believed would cause inflation, thus coming into conflict with Hitler and Göring.

In 1937 Schacht met with Chinese Finance Minister Dr. H. H. Kung. Schacht told him that &quot;German-Chinese friendship stemmed in good part from the hard struggle of both for independence&quot;. Kung said, &quot;China considers Germany its best friend ... I hope and wish that Germany will participate in supporting the further development of China, the opening up of its sources of raw materials, the upbuilding of its industries and means of transportation.&quot;

On 26 November 1937, Schacht resigned as Reich and Prussian Minister of Economics and as General Plenipotentiary at both his and Göring&#x27;s request. He had grown increasingly dissatisfied with Göring&#x27;s near-total ignorance of economics, and was also concerned that Germany was coming close to bankruptcy. His replacement was to be Walther Funk who would take over in February 1938, with Göring serving as acting minister in the interim. Hitler, however, knew that Schacht&#x27;s departure would raise eyebrows outside Germany, and insisted that he remain in the cabinet as minister without portfolio and as President of the &quot;Reichsbank&quot;. Göring also appointed him to the Prussian State Council.

Following the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; of November 1938, Schacht publicly declared his repugnance at the events, and suggested to Hitler that he should use other means if he wanted to be rid of the Jews. He put forward a plan in which Jewish property in Germany would be held in trust, and used as security for loans raised abroad, which would also be guaranteed by the German government. Funds would be made available for Jewish emigrants, in order to overcome the objections of countries that were hesitant to accept penniless Jews. Hitler accepted the suggestion, and authorised him to negotiate with his London contacts. Schacht, in his book &quot;The Magic of Money&quot; (1967), wrote that Montagu Norman and Lord Bearstead, a prominent Jew, had reacted favourably, but Chaim Weizmann, leading spokesman for the British Zionist Federation, opposed the plan. A component of the plan was that emigrating Jews would have taken items such as machinery with them on leaving the country, as a means of boosting German exports. The similar Haavara Agreement allowing German Jews to emigrate to Mandatory Palestine under similar terms had been signed in 1933.

On 20 January 1939, Hitler dismissed Schacht from his post as President of the &quot;Reichsbank&quot; and replaced him with Funk. Schacht remained a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; without portfolio, receiving the same salary, but was excluded from participation in the government. He retired to his house in the country, but continued to occasionally voice private criticisms, culminating in a letter to Göring in November 1942. In it, he assailed the government&#x27;s decision to begin calling up 15-year-olds for service in the airfield defense forces, and cited this as one more item in a litany of factors that he concluded would strengthen the public&#x27;s &quot;misgivings as to how this war will actually end&quot;. The response to the letter was that Hitler dismissed him as a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; without portfolio on 22 January 1943, and he was also dismissed from the Prussian State Council by Göring who cited his &quot;defeatist letter, calculated to undermine the German people&#x27;s powers of resistance&quot;. Another letter from Martin Bormann demanded that Schacht return the Golden Party Badge that he had received in 1937. When Schacht returned to his Berlin home, he found that it was being watched by the Gestapo.

==Resistance activities==
Schacht was said to be in contact with the German resistance to Nazism as early as 1934, though at that time he still believed the Nazi regime would follow his policies. By 1938, he was disillusioned, and was an active participant in the plans for a coup d&#x27;état against Hitler if he started a war against Czechoslovakia. Goerdeler, his colleague in 1935–36, was the civilian leader of resistance to Hitler. Schacht talked frequently with Hans Gisevius, another resistance figure; when resistance organizer Theodor Strünck&#x27;s house (a frequent meeting place) was bombed out, Schacht allowed Strünck and his wife to live in a villa he owned. However, Schacht had remained in the government and, after 1941, Schacht took no active part in any resistance.

Still, at Schacht&#x27;s denazification trial (subsequent to his acquittal at the Nuremberg trials) it was declared by a judge that &quot;None of the civilians in the resistance did more or could have done more than Schacht actually did.&quot;

After the attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life on 20 July 1944, Schacht was arrested on 23 July. He was sent to Ravensbrück, then to Flossenbürg, and finally to Dachau. In late April 1945 he and about 140 other prominent inmates of Dachau were transferred to Tyrol by the SS, which left them there. They were liberated by the Fifth U.S. Army on 5 May 1945 in Niederdorf, South Tyrol, Dolomites, Italy.

==After the war==

Schacht had supported Hitler&#x27;s gaining power, and had been an important official of the Nazi regime. Thus he was arrested by the Allies in 1945. He was put on trial at Nuremberg for &quot;conspiracy&quot; and &quot;crimes against peace&quot; (planning and waging wars of aggression), but not war crimes or crimes against humanity.

Schacht pleaded not guilty to these charges. He cited in his defense that he had lost all official power before the war even began, that he had been in contact with Resistance leaders like Hans Gisevius throughout the war, and that he had been arrested and imprisoned in a concentration camp himself.

His defenders argued that he was just a patriot, trying to make the German economy strong. Furthermore, Schacht was not a member of the NSDAP and shared very little of their ideology. The British judges favored acquittal, while the Soviet judges wanted to convict and execute. The British prevailed and Schacht was acquitted on 1 October 1946. However, at a West German denazification trial, Schacht was sentenced to eight years of hard labor. He was freed on appeal in 1948.

In 1950, Juan Yarur Lolas, the Bethlehem-born founder of the Banco de Crédito e Inversiones and president of the Arab colony in Santiago, Chile, tried to hire Schacht as a &quot;financial adviser&quot; in conjunction with the German-Chilean community. However, the plan fell through when it became news. He served as a hired consultant for Aristotle Onassis, a Greek businessman, during the 1950s. He also advised the Indonesian government in 1951 following the invitation of economic minister Sumitro Djojohadikusumo.

In 1953, Schacht started a bank, &quot;Deutsche Außenhandelsbank Schacht &amp; Co.&quot;, which he led until 1963. He also gave advice on economics and finance to heads of state of developing countries, in particular the Non-Aligned countries; however, some of his suggestions were opposed, one of which was in the Philippines by the former Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas head Miguel Cuaderno, who firmly rebuffed Schacht, stating that his monetary schemes were hardly appropriate for an economy needing capital investment in basic industry and infrastructure.
 
Indirectly resulting from his founding of the bank, Schacht was the plaintiff in a foundational case in German law on the &quot;general right of personality&quot;. A magazine published an article criticizing Schacht, containing several incorrect statements. Schacht first requested that the magazine publish a correction, and when the magazine refused, sued the publisher for violation of his personality rights. The district court found the publisher both civilly and criminally liable; on appeal, the appellate court reversed the criminal conviction, but found that the publisher had violated Schacht&#x27;s general right of personality.

Schacht died in Munich, West Germany, on 3 June 1970.

*When he stabilized the mark in 1923, Schacht&#x27;s office was a former charwoman&#x27;s cupboard. When his secretary, Fräulein Steffeck, was later asked about his work there, she described it as follows:

<text>Snake Island, also known as Serpent Island, White Island, Island of Achilles or Zmiinyi Island (; ), is a Ukrainian island located in the Black Sea, near the Danube Delta, with an important role in delimiting Ukrainian territorial waters.

The island has been known since classical antiquity, and during that era hosted a Greek temple to Achilles. Today, it is administered as part of Izmail Raion of Ukraine&#x27;s Odesa Oblast.

The island is populated, reported to have under 30 people in 2012. A village, Bile, was founded in February 2007 with the purpose of consolidating the status of the island as an inhabited place. This happened during the period in which the island was part of a border dispute between Romania and Ukraine from 2004 to 2009, during which Romania contested the technical definition of the island and borders around it. The territorial limits of the continental shelf around Snake Island were delineated by the International Court of Justice in 2009, providing Romania with almost 80% of the disputed maritime territory.

In the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, two Russian navy warships attacked and captured Snake Island. It was subsequently bombarded heavily by Ukraine and recaptured within a few months, following a Russian withdrawal. 

==Geography==

Snake Island is located 35 km from the coast, east of the mouth of the Danube River. The island is irregularly shaped, with an area of and a maximum diameter of about 700m. The gently sloping terrain reaches its highest point above sea level.

The bedrock of the island consists of Silurian and Devonian sedimentary rocks, primarily metamorphosed, highly cemented quartzite conglomerate-breccias, with subordinate conglomerate, sandstone and clay, which form cliffs surrounding the island up to 25 metres high. The structural geology of the island is defined by a wavy monocline oriented to the northeast, with a small anticline in the eastern part of the island. The island is crisscrossed by faults with both N-S and NE-SW orientations.

The nearest coastal location to the island is Kubanskyi Island on the Ukrainian part of the Danube Delta, located away between the Bystroe Canal and Skhidnyi Channel. The closest Romanian coastal city, Sulina, is away. The closest Ukrainian city is Vylkove, ; however, there also is a port Ust-Dunaisk, away from the island.

For the end of 2011 in Zmiinyi Island coastal waters, 58 fish species (12 of which are included in the Red Data Book of Ukraine) and six crab species were recorded. A presidential decree of 9 December 1998, Number 1341/98, declared the island and coastal waters as a state-protected area. The total protected area covers .

The island was one of the last hauling-out sites in the basin for critically endangered Mediterranean monk seals until the 1950s.

==Population and infrastructure==

About 100 inhabitants live on the island&#x27;s only settlement, Bile, mostly frontier guard servicemen with their families and technical personnel. In 2003, an initiative of the Odesa I. I. Mechnikov National University established the Ostriv Zmiinyi marine research station every year, at which scientists and students from the university conduct research on local fauna, flora, geology, meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, and hydrobiology.

In accordance with a 1997 Treaty between Romania and Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities withdrew an army radio division, demolished a military radar, and transferred all other infrastructure to civilians. Eventually, the Romania-Ukraine international relationships soured (see &quot;Maritime delimitation&quot; section) when Romania tried to assert that the island is no more than a rock in the sea. In February 2007, the Verkhovna Rada approved establishing a rural settlement as part of Vylkove city which is located some distance away at the mouth of the Danube.

In addition to a helicopter platform, in 2002 a pier was built for ships with up to 8 meter draught, and construction of a harbour is underway. The island is supplied with navigation equipment, including a 150-year-old lighthouse. Electric power is provided by a dual solar/diesel power station. The island also has civil infrastructure such as the marine research station, a post office, a bank (branch of the Ukrainian bank &quot;Aval&quot;), the first-aid station, a satellite television provider, a phone network, a cell phone tower, and an Internet link. Most of building structures are located either in the middle of the island by a lighthouse or the northeastern peninsula of the island by its pier.

The island lacks a fresh water source. Its border guard contingent is regularly resupplied by air. Since 2009 the development of the island was suspended due to financing which caused a great degree of concern of local authorities asking for more funding from the state.

===Lighthouse===
The Snake Island Lighthouse was built in the autumn of 1842 by the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Empire. The lighthouse is an octagonal-shaped building, 12 meters tall, located near the highest elevated area of the island, 40 meters above the sea level. The lighthouse built on site of the previously destroyed temple of Achilles is adjacent to a housing building. The remnants of the Greek temple were found in 1823.

As lighthouse technology progressed, in 1860 new lighthouse lamps were bought from England, and one of them was installed in the Lighthouse in 1862. In the early 1890s a new kerosene lamp was installed, with lamp rotating equipment and flat lenses. It improved the lighthouse visibility to . The lighthouse was either destroyed or damaged in the First World War (it is not clear which). It was subsequently rebuilt (see #World War I below).

The lighthouse was heavily damaged during World War II by Soviet aviation and German retreating forces. It was restored at the end of 1944 by the Odesa military radio detachment. In 1949 it was further reconstructed and equipped by the Black Sea Fleet. The lighthouse was further upgraded in 1975 and 1984. In 1988 a new radio beacon &quot;KPM-300&quot; was installed with radio signal range of .

In August 2004, the lighthouse was equipped with a radio beacon &quot;Yantar-2M-200&quot;, which provides differential correction signal for global navigation satellite systems GPS and GLONASS.

The lighthouse is listed as UKR 050 by ARLHS, EU-182 by IOTA, and BS-07 by UIA.

==History and mythology==

=== Ancient history ===
The island was named (, &#x27;White Island&#x27;) by the Greeks, and was similarly known by Romans as , probably because of its white marble formations. According to Dionysius Periegetes, it was called Leuke because the serpents there were white. According to Arrian, it was called Leuke due to its color. He and Stephanus of Byzantium mentioned that the island was also referred to as the Island of Achilles ( and ) and the Racecourse of Achilles ( and ), though this is now identified with the Tendra Spit.

The island was sacred to the hero Achilles and had a temple of him with a statue inside. Solinus wrote that on the island there was a sacred shrine. According to Arrian, in the temple there were many offerings to Achilles and Patroclus. Furthermore, people came to the island and sacrificed or set animals free in honour of Achilles. He also added that people said that Achilles and Patroclus appeared in front of them as hallucinations or in their dreams while they were approaching the coast of the island or sailing a short distance from it. Pliny the Elder wrote that the tomb of the hero was on the island. According to the legend, on the island no bird flew higher than the temple of Achilles.

The uninhabited isle (&quot;of Achilles&quot;) was the major sanctuary of the hero, where &quot;seabirds dipped their wings in water to sweep the temples clean&quot;, according to Constantine D. Kyriazis. Several temples of Thracian Apollo can be found here, and there are submerged ruins.

According to Greek myths the island was created by Poseidon for Achilles to inhabit, but also for sailors to have an island to anchor at the Euxine Sea, but the sailors should never sleep on the island. According to a surviving epitome of the lost Trojan War epic of Arctinus of Miletus, the remains of Achilles and Patroclus were brought to this island by Thetis, to be put in a sanctuary, furnishing the , or founding myth of the Hellenic cult of Achilles centred here. According to another myth Thetis gave the island to Achilles and let him live there. The oracle of Delphi sent Leonymus (other writers called him Autoleon) to the Island, telling him that there Ajax the Great would appear to him and cure his wound. Leonymus said that on the island he saw Achilles, Ajax the Great, Ajax the Lesser, Patroclus, Antilochus and Helen of Troy. In addition, Helen told him to go to Stesichorus at Himera and tell him that the loss of his sight was caused by her wrath. Pomponius Mela wrote that Achilles was buried there.

In &quot;Andromache&quot;, a work of Euripides, Thetis mention the island and said that Achilles was &quot;dwelling on his island home&quot;. 

Ruins believed to be of a square temple dedicated to Achilles, 30 meters to a side, were discovered by the Russian naval Captain N. D. Kritzkii in 1823, but the subsequent construction of a lighthouse on the site obliterated all trace of it. Ovid, who was banished to Tomis, mentions the island, so do Ptolemy and Strabo. The island is described in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, IV.27.1. It is also described in Arrian&#x27;s Letter to Emperor Hadrian, a historical document movingly drawn upon by Marguerite Yourcenar in her &quot;Memoirs of Hadrian&quot;.

Several ancient inscriptions were found on the island, including a 4th-century BC Olbiopolitan decree which praises someone for defeating and driving out the pirates that lived on the &quot;holy island&quot;. Another inscription which found on the island and dates back to the fifth century BC writes: &quot;Glaukos, son of Posideios, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke&quot;

A fragment was found on the island which was signed by the ancient painter Epiktetos and the potter Nikosthenes.

The island was one of the three sites in the Black Sea which stand out in the cult of Achilles, the other two being the Racecourse of Achilles and the Pontic Olbia.

===Ottoman era===

The Greeks during the Ottoman Empire renamed it Fidonisi (, &#x27;Snake Island&#x27;) and the island gave its name to the naval Battle of Fidonisi, fought between the Ottoman and Russian fleets in 1788, during the course of the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792.

In 1829, following the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, the island became part of the Russian Empire until 1856.

In 1877, following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, the Ottoman Empire gave the island and Northern Dobruja region to Romania, as a reimbursement for the Russian annexation of Romania&#x27;s Southern Bessarabia region.

=== World War I and interwar period ===
As part of the Romanian alliance with Russia, the Russians operated a wireless station on the island, which was destroyed on 25 June 1917 when it was bombarded by the Ottoman cruiser &quot;Midilli&quot; (built as SMS of the German Navy). The lighthouse (built by Marius Michel Pasha in 1860) was also damaged and possibly destroyed.

The 1920 Treaty of Versailles reconfirmed the island as part of Romania. The lighthouse was rebuilt in 1922.

=== World War II ===

The island, under Romanian control during the Second World War, was the location of a radio station used by the Axis forces, which turned it into a target for the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. The island&#x27;s defences mainly consisted of several 122 mm and 76 mm anti-aircraft guns, captured from the Russians. The Romanian marine platoon defending the island was also equipped with two 45 mm coastal guns, two 37 mm anti-aircraft guns, and two anti-aircraft machine guns.

The first naval action took place on 23 June 1941, when the Soviet destroyer leader &quot;Kharkov&quot; together with the destroyers &quot;Bezposhchadny&quot; and &quot;Smyshlyonyi&quot; and several torpedo boats ran a patrol near the island, but found no Axis ships.

On 9 July 1941, the Soviet destroyer leader &quot;Tashkent&quot; together with four other destroyers (&quot;Bodry&quot;, &quot;Boiky&quot;, &quot;Bezuprechny&quot;, and &quot;Bezposhchadny&quot;) conducted a shipping sweep operation near the island, but did not make any contacts.

On 7 September 1941, two Soviet submarines of the &quot;Shchuka&quot; class (&quot;Shch-208&quot; and &quot;Shch-213&quot;) and three of the M class (&quot;M-35&quot;, &quot;M-56&quot;, and &quot;M-62&quot;) conducted a patrol near the island.

On 29–30 October and 5 November 1942, the Romanian minelayers and &quot;Dacia&quot;, together with the Romanian destroyers , , the Romanian flotilla leader , the Romanian gunboat &quot;Stihi&quot; and four German R boats laid two mine barrages around the island.

On 1 December 1942, while the Soviet cruiser &quot;Voroshilov&quot; together with the destroyer &quot;Soobrazitelny&quot; were bombarding the island with forty-six 180 mm and fifty-seven 100 mm shells, the cruiser was damaged by Romanian mines, but it managed to return to Poti for repairs under her own power. During the brief bombardment, she struck the radio station, barracks and lighthouse on the island, but failed to inflict significant losses.

On 11 December 1942, the Soviet submarine &quot;Shch-212&quot; was sunk by a Romanian minefield near the island along with all of her crew of 44. The Soviet submarine &quot;M-31&quot; was either sunk as well by the Romanian mine barrages near the island on 17 December, or sunk with depth charges by the Romanian flotilla leader &quot;Mărășești&quot; on 7 July 1943.

On 25 August 1943, two Romanian motorboats spotted a Soviet submarine near the island and attacked her with depth charges, but it managed to escape.

The Romanian marines were evacuated from the island and Soviet troops occupied it on 29–30 August 1944.

=== Post-WWII history ===
The Paris Peace Treaties of 1947 between the protagonists of World War II stipulated that Romania cede Northern Bukovina, the Hertsa region, Budjak, and Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, but made no mention of the mouths of the Danube and Snake Island.

Until 1948, Snake Island was a part of Romania. On 4 February 1948, during the delimitation of the frontier, Romania and the Soviet Union signed a protocol that left Snake Island and several islets on the Danube south of the 1917 Romanian-Russian border under Soviet administration. Romania disputed the validity of this protocol, since it was never ratified by either of the two countries; nevertheless it did not make any official claim on the territories.

The same year, in 1948, during the Cold War, a Soviet radar post was built on the isle (for both naval and anti-aircraft purposes).

The Soviet Union&#x27;s possession of Snake Island was confirmed in the Treaty between the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of Romania and the Government of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics on the Romanian-Soviet State Border Regime, Collaboration and Mutual Assistance on Border Matters, signed in Bucharest on 27 February 1961.

Between 1967 and 1987, the USSR and Romanian side negotiated the delimitation of the continental shelf. The Romanian side refused to accept a Russian offer of out of around the island in 1987.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine inherited control over the island. A number of Romanian parties and organizations consistently claimed it should be included in its territory. According to the Romanian side, in the peace treaties of 1918 and 1920 (after World War I), the isle was considered part of Romania, and it was not mentioned in the 1947 border-changing treaty between Romania and the Soviet Union.

In 1997, Romania and Ukraine signed a treaty in which both states &quot;reaffirm that the existing border between them is inviolable and therefore, they shall refrain, now and in future, from any attempt against the border, as well as from any demand, or act of, seizure and usurpation of part or all the territory of the Contracting Party&quot;. However, both sides have agreed that if no resolution on maritime borders can be reached within two years, then either side can go to the International Court of Justice to seek a final ruling.

In 2007, the island&#x27;s only settlement Bile was founded.

In 2008, twelve Ukrainian border guards died when their helicopter flying from Odesa to Snake Island crashed, killing all but one on board.

Until 18 July 2020, the island belonged to Kiliia Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Odesa Oblast to seven. The area of Kiliia Raion was merged into Izmail Raion.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===

Militarily, Snake Island, from the coast of Ukraine, is within the range of missile, artillery, and drone strikes from the shore, and exposed to attacks from all directions from air and sea, making any garrison &quot;sitting ducks&quot;. It is a strategically significant island in the Black Sea, and Russian control over the island would allow a total blockade of the Ukrainian port city of Odesa.

On 24 February 2022, on the first day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, two Russian naval warships &quot;Vasily Bykov&quot; and &quot;Moskva&quot;, attacked Snake Island. Upon receiving a transmission from one of the Russian naval warships requesting surrender or else threatening bombardment, a Ukrainian border guard responded, &quot;Russian warship, go fuck yourself.&quot; The response gained worldwide attention and became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Later on the same day, Russian forces landed and captured the island.

Initially, the Ukrainian government erroneously reported that all 13 members of the garrison had died in the attack, and President Volodymyr Zelensky &quot;posthumously&quot; awarded the Hero of Ukraine, Ukraine&#x27;s highest award, to the 13 defenders. The Ukrainian navy clarified later in February that the garrison were alive. On 29 March 2022, the Defence Ministry of Ukraine posted on Twitter that the speaker of the phrase had been freed from captivity and given a medal for bravery. The Ukrainian Postal Service in April 2022 issued a stamp showing a Ukrainian soldier showing the finger (an offensive gesture of defiance) to the Russian ship &quot;Moskva&quot;. 

Ukrainian forces launched an operation to expel the Russians from Snake Island, targeting exposed Russian positions in an over four month-long campaign. Ukrainian military sources said they carried out attacks on both the island proper and on any Russian vessels bringing troops and weapons to it. New Western weapons supplies to Ukraine were key to turning the tide of the campaign in Ukraine&#x27;s favor, especially the HIMARS rocket system. 

In late June 2022, Russian forces withdrew from the island in what the BBC referred to as both a symbolic and strategic victory for Ukraine. Ukrainian sources claimed the Russians fled in two speedboats after being unable to withstand Ukrainian strikes. Russia referred to the withdrawal as a &quot;gesture of goodwill&quot; after completing its military objectives on the island.

On 8 July 2023 president Zelensky visited the island to commemorate Ukrainian soldiers who defended it. On 13 July 2023 Russian forces dropped a single aerial bomb on the island.

==Maritime delimitation==
The status of Snake Island was important for delimitation of continental shelf and exclusive economic zones between Romania and Ukraine. If Snake Island were recognized as an island, then continental shelf around it should be considered as Ukrainian water. If Snake Island were not an island, but an islet, then in accordance with international law the maritime boundary between Romania and Ukraine should be drawn without taking into consideration the isle location.

On 4 July 2003, the President of Romania Ion Iliescu and the President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed a treaty about friendship and cooperation. Romania promised not to contest territories of Ukraine or Moldova, which it lost to the Soviet Union after World War II, but requested that Russia as a successor of the Soviet Union recognized in some form its responsibility for what had happened.

On 16 September 2004, the Romanian side brought a case against Ukraine to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in a dispute concerning the maritime boundary between the two States in the Black Sea.

In 2007, Ukraine founded the small settlement of Bile on the island, which was criticized by Romania.

On 3 February 2009, the ICJ delivered its judgment, which divided the sea area of the Black Sea along a line which was between the claims of each country. The Court invoked the disproportionality test in adjudicating the dispute, noting that the ICJ, &quot;as its jurisprudence has indicated, it may on occasion decide not to take account of very small islands or decide not to give them their full potential entitlement to maritime zones, should such an approach have a disproportionate effect on the delimitation line under consideration&quot; and owing to a previous agreement between Ukraine and Romania, the island &quot;should have no effect on the delimitation in this case, other than that stemming from the role of the 12-nautical-mile arc of its territorial sea&quot; previously agreed between the parties.

<doc id="390774" wikidata="Q29443" url="?curid=390774" title="Pound cake">
<text>Pound cake is a type of cake traditionally made with a pound of each of four ingredients: flour, butter, eggs, and sugar. Pound cakes are generally baked in either a loaf pan or a Bundt mold. They are sometimes served either dusted with powdered sugar, lightly glazed with syrup, or with a coat of icing.

==History==
The earliest recipe for pound cake is found in the English cook book &quot;The Art of Cookery&quot; by Hannah Glasse, published in 1747. The first U.S. cookbook, &quot;American Cookery&quot;, published in 1796, has a recipe for pound cake.

Over time, the ingredients for pound cake changed. Eliza Leslie, who wrote the 1851 edition of &quot;Direction for Cookery&quot;, used 10 eggs, beat them as lightly as possible, mixed them with a pound of flour, then added the juice of two lemons or three large oranges. This changed the flavor and texture of the cake. In the 2008 issue of &quot;Saveur&quot;, James Villas wrote that cake flour would not work in place of all-purpose flour because it lacks the strength to support the heavy batter.

In some recipes from 19th century cookbooks, fruit was also added to the cake.

An early variation on this cake replaced some of the flour with cornmeal made from dried corn (maize), which was then called &quot;Indian meal&quot;. A recipe for Indian pound cake was first published in 1828 by Eliza Leslie and later included in &quot;The Indian Meal Book&quot;, which was published in London in 1846, when people in Ireland were looking for alternatives to expensive wheat flour.

==Variations==

There are numerous variations on the traditional pound cake, with certain countries and regions having distinctive styles. These can include the addition of flavoring agents (such as vanilla extract or almond extract) or dried fruit (such as currants or dried cranberries), as well as alterations to the original recipe to change the characteristics of the resulting pound cake. For instance, baking soda or baking powder may be incorporated to induce leavening during baking, resulting in a less dense pound cake. A cooking oil (typically a vegetable oil) is sometimes substituted for some or all of the butter, which is intended to produce a moister cake. Sour cream pound cake is a popular variation in the United States, which involves the substitution of sour cream for some of the butter, which also is intended to produce a moister cake with a tangy flavor. Some of these variations may drastically change the texture and flavor of the pound cake, but the name pound cake is often still used. Some of the variations are described below.

===French style===

Pound cake is served in France. The name of the pound cake , means four quarters. There are equal weights in each of the four quarters. In tradition, the popular cake of the French region of Brittany, as its name implies, uses the same quantity of the four ingredients, but with no added fruit of any kind. However, the Caribbean parts of the world that speak French traditionally add rum to the ingredients for Christmas Eve or even mashed bananas for extra moisture. In some cases, the French might have beaten egg whites instead of whole eggs to lighten the batter. Other variants include adding chocolate or lemon juice for flavor.
===Mexican style===
In Mexico, the pound cake is called &#x27;. The basic recipe of Mexican &#x27; is much like the traditional U.S. recipe. Most common variants are &#x27; (pound cake with walnuts) and &#x27; (pound cake with raisins).

===Colombian style===
&quot;Ponqué&quot; is the Colombian version of the pound cake: the term is itself a Spanish phonetic approximation of &quot;pound-cake&quot;. The &quot;ponqué&quot; is essentially a wine-drenched cake with a cream or sugar coating, and it is very popular at birthdays, weddings and other social celebrations.

===German style===

The German term &quot;Rührkuchen&quot; (stirred cake) refers to any kind of cake where a batter is made by mixing flour, butter, eggs, sugar, and often milk. The concept of the first four ingredients having equal proportions is not common, but, nevertheless, this style of cake batter forms the basis of many popular cake recipes. With the simple addition of nuts, cocoa, dried fruits and alcohols, and the use of different shapes and sizes of tins, a wide variety of traditional German cakes are made. For example, this dough or a minor variation of it is often used to make cakes made in a loaf tin (&#x27; - orange cake; &#x27; - hazelnut cake), marbled cakes in a bundt tin (&#x27; ) and other flavor combinations in shaped tins (&#x27; - fake venison saddle with bitter chocolate and almonds, &quot;Osterlamm&quot; - Easter Lamb with vanilla and rum).
In the technical language of professional baking, these recipes are classified as &quot;Eischwerteig mit Fett&quot; (&quot;egg-heavy batter with shortening&quot;). For example, in a German cooks&#x27; vocational school book from the 1980s the basic recipe for such a cake baked in a 26 cm (10&quot;) spring form tin is given as four eggs, three egg-weights of butter, four egg-weights of sugar, three egg-weights of flour and one egg-weight of starch. It is close to the English pound of each and the French four equal quarters.

==Cherry cake==

Cherry cake is a traditional British cake. The cake consists of glacé cherries evenly suspended within a Madeira sponge; it can also be considered as a basic or trivial variation of pound cake. Glacé cherries are used because the moisture within fresh cherries causes them to sink to the bottom of any cake, ruining the cake&#x27;s form.

Cakes with cherries inside them are found in many other cuisines.

<text>Vincent Keith Brooks (born 24 October 1958) is a retired United States Army general who last commanded United States Forces Korea, United Nations Command, and ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command. He previously served as the commanding general of United States Army Pacific and prior to that as the commanding general of Third Army. Brooks was the United States Central Command Deputy Director of Operations during the War in Iraq, and frequently briefed the media, which raised his public profile. He also served as the Chief of Army Public Affairs The Pentagon. He was the deputy commander of 1st Cavalry Division in Baghdad during the 2006–2008 &quot;surge&quot; and upon returning to the United States became the commanding general of the same division. He later was commanding general of the 1st Infantry Division. Brooks assumed command in Korea on 30 April 2016, and was succeeded by Robert B. Abrams in November 2018, then retired on 1 January 2019.

==Family==
Brooks was born in Anchorage, Alaska, on 24 October 1958. He grew up as an Army brat in a prominent military family in California. His father, Major General Leo A. Brooks Sr., and brother, Brigadier General Leo A. Brooks Jr., both retired after careers in the United States Army. His uncle, Francis K. Brooks, was the majority leader of the Vermont House of Representatives and a member of the Vermont Senate. Brooks attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria, Virginia for two years, and then Jesuit High School in Carmichael, California, where he graduated in 1976. He was a varsity basketball player, and decided to follow his brother to United States Military Academy at West Point to earn a commission as an officer.

==Military service==
At West Point, Brooks was the academy&#x27;s first African-American First Captain, the highest position (Cadet Brigade Commander) a cadet can hold, an appointment which brought much public visibility at an early age in life. He graduated from West Point in 1980.

After graduating, Brooks served in South Korea and Kosovo among other places. In Kosovo, he concurrently served as the deputy commander of the U.S. force in Kosovo (Task Force Falcon) and as commander of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division based at Fort Stewart in Georgia. From that position he moved to the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon. While serving there he was temporarily assigned to be deputy director of Operations at United States Central Command (CENTCOM). Returning to the Pentagon and the Joint Staff in April 2003, he became the Lead Strategic Planner for the Global War on Terrorism working closely with the CIA, the Departments of State, Treasury and Justice, the FBI and the military&#x27;s United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM).
In his role as deputy director of Operations, Brooks also became the spokesperson of CENTCOM, the main force in the Middle East. At that time he was the youngest general officer in the army.

From 2006 to 2008 Brooks served as the Deputy Commanding General of the 1st Cavalry Division, serving for fifteen months in Baghdad as second-in-command of the main effort (Multinational Division – Baghdad) stabilizing the Iraqi capital city and province during what is now called &quot;The Surge.&quot; Upon return from Iraq, he took command of the 1st Cavalry Division until April 2008. Following an assignment as the Deputy Commanding General of the Army&#x27;s III (Third) Corps at Fort Hood, Texas, he again took command of a combat unit, serving as the Commanding General of the historic 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley in Kansas from April 2009 to May 2011. He deployed the unit to Iraq for a year, serving as U.S. Division – South, responsible for securing the heavily Shi&#x27;ite areas of the southern half of the country. The headquarters was in Basra, Iraq. Following two years in a second division-level command, Brooks took command of U.S. Army Central and Third Army responsible for all U.S. Army operations throughout the Middle East and Central Asia (from Egypt to Kazakhstan). During this time, Brooks oversaw the reduction of forces in Iraq as well as the build up of forces in Afghanistan.

As the Commanding General of United States Army Pacific and as a part of the &quot;Asia Pivot&quot; of the Obama administration foreign policy, Brooks envisioned and executed the &quot;Pacific Pathways&quot; program. The program consists of a single United States Army unit that would move to different countries of the Asia and Pacific regions for up to three months at a time to develop first-hand understanding of the region. While initially criticized in some circles, the innovative approach has met high acclaim from the countries of the region and the units involved in the missions.

In March 2016, Brooks was nominated to command United States Forces Korea, the U.S.-South Korea Combined Forces Command, and United Nations Command, succeeding General Curtis Scaparrotti. He served until October 2018, and was succeeded by Robert B. Abrams. On 4 November 2016, Brooks was bestowed the Korean name Park Yu-jong by the ROK-US Alliance Friendship Association to show appreciation for his contributions to strengthening relations between the American and Korean armed forces. He also received a scroll and a taekwondo black belt and uniform inscribed with the moniker. Brooks retired on 1 January 2019, following the completion of his command assignment in Korea.

== Retirement ==
After retiring from the U.S. military, Brooks has served as a director on multiple corporate boards, including Diamondback Energy and the project management and engineering firm Jacobs, which contracts heavily with the U.S. military. He is also a principal with WestExec Advisors, a consulting firm that helps &quot;defense corporations market their products to the Pentagon and other agencies,&quot; according to the Project On Government Oversight.

<doc id="390777" wikidata="Q804868" url="?curid=390777" title="Baldwin Locomotive Works">
<text>The Baldwin Locomotive Works (BLW) was an American manufacturer of railway locomotives from 1825 to 1951. Originally located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, it moved to nearby Eddystone in the early 20th century. The company was for decades the world&#x27;s largest producer of steam locomotives, but struggled to compete when demand switched to diesel locomotives. Baldwin produced the last of its 70,000-plus locomotives in 1951, before merging with the Lima-Hamilton Corporation on September 11, 1951, to form the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation.

The company has no relation to the E.M. Baldwin and Sons of New South Wales, Australia, a builder of small diesel locomotives for sugar cane railroads.

==History: 19th century==

===Beginning===

Matthias W. Baldwin, the founder, was a jeweler and whitesmith, who, in 1825, formed a partnership with machinist David H. Mason, and began making bookbinders&#x27; tools and cylinders for calico printing. Baldwin then designed and constructed a small stationary steam engine for his own use. This proved so successful and efficient that he was asked to build others like it. The original engine was in use and powered many departments of the works for well over 60 years, and is currently on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.

In 1831. Baldwin built a miniature locomotive for exhibition at the request of the Philadelphia Museum, which was such a success that he received an order from a railway company for a locomotive to run on a short line to the suburbs of Philadelphia. The Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad (C&amp;A) had already imported their &quot;John Bull&quot; locomotive from England, and it was stored in Bordentown, New Jersey awaiting assembly when Baldwin inspected it, noting the principal dimensions of the parts.

Without the benefit of modern machine tools the cylinders were bored by a chisel fixed in a block of wood and turned by hand; the workmen had to be taught how to do nearly all the work; and Baldwin did a great deal of it himself. The locomotive &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; was completed and successfully tested on the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad on November 23, 1832. It worked the line for over 20 years. It weighed a little over five tons with four diameter driving wheels and bore by stroke cylinders. The wheels had heavy cast iron hubs, with wooden spokes and rims and wrought iron tires, and the outside frame was made of wood. The diameter boiler took 20 minutes to raise steam. Top speed was .

===Early years===
Baldwin struggled to survive the Panic of 1837. Production fell from 40 locomotives in 1837 to just nine in 1840 and the company was heavily in debt. As part of the survival strategy, Matthias Baldwin took on two partners, George Vail and George Hufty. Although the partnerships proved relatively short-lived, they helped Baldwin pull through the economic hard times.

Zerah Colburn was one of many engineers who had a close association with Baldwin Locomotive Works. Between 1854 (and the start of his weekly paper, the &quot;Railroad Advocate&quot;) and 1861, when Colburn went to work more or less permanently in London, England, the journalist was in frequent touch with M. W. Baldwin, as recorded in Zerah Colburn: The Spirit of Darkness. Colburn was full of praise for the quality of Baldwin&#x27;s work.

In the 1850s, railroad building became a national obsession, with many new carriers starting up, particularly in the Midwest and South. While this helped drive up demand for Baldwin products, it also increased competition as more companies entered the locomotive production field.

Still, Baldwin had trouble keeping pace with orders and in the early 1850s began paying workers piece-rate pay. By 1857, the company turned out 66 locomotives and employed 600 men. But another economic downturn, this time the Panic of 1857, cut into business again. Output fell by 50 percent in 1858.

===1860–1899===
The Civil War at first appeared disastrous for Baldwin. According to John K. Brown in &quot;The Baldwin Locomotive Works, 1831–1915: A Study in American Industrial Practice&quot;, at the start of the conflict Baldwin had a great dependence on Southern railways as its primary market. In 1860, nearly 80 percent of Baldwin&#x27;s output went to carriers in states that would soon secede from the Union. As a result, Baldwin&#x27;s production in 1861 fell more than 50 percent compared to the previous year. However, the loss in Southern sales was counterbalanced by purchases by the United States Military Railroads and the Pennsylvania Railroad, which saw its traffic soar, as Baldwin produced more than 100 engines for carriers during the 1861–1865 war.

By the time Matthias Baldwin died in 1866, his company was vying with Rogers Locomotive &amp; Machine Works for the top spot among locomotive producers. By 1870 Baldwin had taken the lead and a decade later, it was producing 2 times as many engines as its nearest competitor, according to the U.S. Manufacturing Census.


In 1897 the Baldwin Locomotive Works was presented as one of the examples of successful shop management in a series of articles by Horace Lucian Arnold. The article specifically described the Piece Rate System used in the shop management.

Burton (1899) commented, that &quot;in the Baldwin Locomotive Works... piecework rates are seldom altered... Some rates have remained unchanged for the past twenty years, and a workman is there more highly esteemed when he can, by his own exertions and ability, increase his weekly earnings. He has an absolute incentive to increase his output as much as he possibly can, because he knows that he will not, by increasing his own income, lead to cutting piece-work rates, and so be forced to make still further exertions in order to maintain the same weekly wage.&quot;

==History: 20th century==

Initially, Baldwin built many more steam locomotives at its cramped Broad Street Philadelphia shop but would begin an incremental shift in production to a site located at Spring Street in nearby Eddystone, Pennsylvania, in 1906. Broad Street was constricted, but even so, it was a huge complex, occupying the better part of 8 square city blocks from Broad to 18th Streets and Spring Garden Street to the Reading tracks just past Noble Street. Eddystone had a capacity of well over 3000 locomotives per year. The move from Broad Street was completed in the late 1920s.

===Gilded age===

The American railroad industry expanded significantly between 1898 and 1907, with domestic demand for locomotives hitting its highest point in 1905. Baldwin&#x27;s business boomed during this period while it modernized its Broad Street facilities. Despite this boom, Baldwin faced many challenges, including the constraints of space in the Philadelphia facility, inflation, increased labor costs, Labor tensions, the substantial increase in the size of the locomotives being manufactured, and the formation of the American Locomotive Company, an aggressive competitor which eventually became known simply as Alco.

From 1904 to 1943, Baldwin and Westinghouse marketed Baldwin-Westinghouse electric locomotives and A.C. electrification of railroads, particularly to the New Haven Railroad.

In 1906 the Hepburn Act authorized greater governmental authority over railroad companies, and revitalized the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which stepped up its activities. The ICC was given the power to set maximum railroad rates, and to replace existing rates with &quot;just-and-reasonable&quot; maximum rates, as defined by the ICC.

The limitation on railroad rates depreciated the value of railroad securities, and meant that railroads stopped ordering new equipment, including locomotives. The Panic of 1907 in turn disrupted finance and investment in new plants. Both of these events had a direct negative effect on the railroad industry, especially the locomotive builders.
Baldwin&#x27;s locomotive output dropped from 2,666 in 1906 to 614 in 1908. The company cut its workforce from 18,499 workers in 1907 to 4,600 the following year. Baldwin&#x27;s business was further imperiled when William P. Henszey, one of Baldwin&#x27;s partners, died. His death left Baldwin with a US$6 million liability. In response, Baldwin incorporated and released US$10 million worth of bonds. Samuel Vauclain wanted to use these funds to expand Baldwin&#x27;s capacities so it would be prepared for another boom. While other Baldwin officers opposed this expansion, Vauclain&#x27;s vision won out; Baldwin would continue to expand its Eddystone plant until its completion in 1928. By 1928, the company moved all locomotive production to this location, though the plant would never exceed more than one-third of its production capacity.

===World War I===
Baldwin was an important contributor to the Allied war effort in World War I. Baldwin built 5,551 locomotives for the Allies including separate designs for Russian, French, British and United States trench railways. Baldwin built railway gun carriages for the United States Navy and manufactured 6,565,355 artillery shells for Russia, Great Britain and the United States. From 1915 to 1918, Remington Arms subcontracted the production of nearly 2 million Pattern 1914 Enfield and M1917 Enfield rifles to the Baldwin Locomotive Works. Baldwin expanded its Eddystone, Pennsylvania works into the Eddystone Arsenal, which manufactured most of these rifles and artillery shells before being converted to locomotive shops when the war ended.

Following the war Baldwin continued to supply export orders, as the European powers strove to replace large numbers of locomotives either worn out or destroyed during the war, as European locomotive factories were still re-tooling from armaments production back to railroad production. In 1919 and 1920 Baldwin supplied 50 4-6-0 locomotives to the Palestine Military Railway that became the Palestine Railways H class.

===Decline===
After the boom years of World War I and its aftermath, Baldwin&#x27;s business would decline as the Great Depression gripped the country and diesel locomotives became the growth market on American railways towards the end of the 1930s. During the 1920s the major locomotive manufacturers had strong incentives to maintain the dominance of the steam engine. The Baldwin-Westinghouse consortium, which had produced electric locomotives since 1904, was in fact the first American locomotive builder to develop a road diesel locomotive, in 1925. Its twin-engine design was not successful, and the unit was scrapped after a short testing and demonstration period. Westinghouse and Baldwin collaborated again in 1929 to build switching and road locomotives (the latter through Baldwin&#x27;s subsidiary Canadian Locomotive Company). The road locomotives, Canadian National class V1-a, No. 9000 and No. 9001, proved expensive, unreliable, frequently out of service, and were soon retired. Westinghouse cancelled its efforts in the diesel locomotive field with the onset of the Great Depression, opting to supply electrical parts instead. The early, unsuccessful efforts of Baldwin-Westinghouse in developing diesel-electric locomotion for mainline service led Baldwin in the 1930s to discount the possibility that diesel could replace steam. In 1930 Samuel Vauclain, chairman of the board, stated in a speech that advances in steam technology would ensure the dominance of the steam engine until at least 1980. Baldwin&#x27;s vice president and Director of Sales stated in December 1937 that &quot;Some time in the future, when all this is reviewed, it will be found that our railroads are no more dieselized than they electrified&quot;. Baldwin had deep roots in the steam locomotive industry and may have been influenced by heavy investment in its Eddystone plant, which had left them overextended financially and operating at a fraction of capacity as the market for steam locomotives declined in the 1930s.

In contrast, ALCO, while remaining committed to steam production, pursued R&amp;D paths centered on both steam mainline engines and diesel switch engines in the 1920s and &#x27;30s, which would position them to compete in the future market for diesel locomotives.

In 1928 Baldwin began an attempt to diversify its product line to include small internal combustion-electric locomotives but the Great Depression thwarted these efforts, eventually leading Baldwin to declare bankruptcy in 1935. At the invitation of the owners of the Geo D. Whitcomb Company, a small manufacturer of gasoline and diesel industrial locomotives in Rochelle, Illinois, Baldwin agreed to participate in a recapitalization program, purchasing about half of the issued stock. By March 1931 the small firm was in financial trouble and Baldwin filed a voluntary bankruptcy for Whitcomb with Baldwin gaining complete control and creating a new subsidiary, the Whitcomb Locomotive Company. This action would lead to financial losses, an ugly court battle between Baldwin and William Whitcomb, the former owner of the company, and bankruptcy for both parties.

Baldwin lost its dominant position in electric locomotives when the Pennsylvania Railroad selected General Electric&#x27;s design for what became its GG1 class instead of Baldwin&#x27;s design in 1934.

When Baldwin emerged from bankruptcy in 1938 it underwent a drastic change in management, which revived the company&#x27;s development efforts with diesel power, but it was already too far behind. In 1939 Baldwin offered its first standard line of diesel locomotives, all designed for yard service. By this time, Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC) was already ramping up production of diesel passenger locomotives and developing its first diesel road freight locomotive.

As the 1930s drew to a close, Baldwin&#x27;s coal-country customers such as Pennsylvania Railroad, Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, and Norfolk &amp; Western, were more reluctant than other operators to embrace a technology which could undermine the demand for one of their main hauling markets. All three continued to acquire passenger steam locomotives into the early postwar years, as dieselization was gaining momentum elsewhere in the rail industry.

In the late 1930s Baldwin and the Pennsylvania Railroad made an all-in bet on the future of steam in passenger rail service with Baldwin&#x27;s duplex-drive S1 locomotive. It proved difficult to operate, prone to slipping, costly to maintain, and unsuited for its intended service. Baldwin developed a revision of the same basic design with the T1, introduced in 1943. While the T1s could operate on more tracks than the S1, they still had many of the problems of the S1, and additional mechanical problems related to their unique valve design. The whole S1-T1 venture resulted in losses for PRR and investment in a dead-end development effort for Baldwin at a critical time for both companies. In the early 1940s Baldwin embarked upon its efforts to develop steam turbine power, producing the S2 direct-drive turbine locomotive in 1944. Baldwin&#x27;s steam turbine program failed to produce a single successful design. Baldwin&#x27;s steam-centered development path had left them flat-footed in the efforts necessary to compete in the postwar diesel market dominated by EMC and Alco-GE.

The United States&#x27; entry into World War II impeded Baldwin&#x27;s diesel development program when the War Production Board dictated that Alco and Baldwin produce only steamers and diesel-electric yard switching engines. The General Motors Electro-Motive Corporation was assigned the task of producing road freight diesels (namely, the FT series). EMC&#x27;s distinct advantage over its competitors in that product line in the years that followed World War II, due to the head start in diesel R&amp;D and production, is beyond doubt, however, assigning it solely to WPB directives is questionable. Longtime GM chairman Alfred Sloan presented a timeline in his memoir that belies this assumption, saying that GM&#x27;s diesel-engine R&amp;D efforts of the 1920s and 1930s, and its application of model design standardization (yielding lower unit costs) and marketing lessons learned in the automotive industry, were the principal reason for EMC&#x27;s competitive advantage in the late 1940s and afterward (clearly implying that the wartime production assignments were merely nails in a coffin that Baldwin and Lima had already built for themselves before the war). In his telling, the R&amp;D needed to adapt earlier diesels (best suited to marine and stationary use) to locomotive use (more flexible output; higher power-to-weight ratio; more reliable given more vibration and less maintenance) was a capital-intensive project that almost no one among the railroad owners or locomotive builders was willing (latter) or able (former) to invest in during the 1920s and 1930s except for the GM Research Corporation led by Charles Kettering, and the GM subsidiaries Winton Engine Corporation and Electro-Motive Corporation.

Baldwin made steam engines for domestic US railroads, the US Army, British railways, and made around one thousand E or Ye type engines for the Soviet Union in the Lend Lease arrangement (of an order of 2000 or so engines with other builders contributing to the total).
Baldwin obtained a short-term market boost from naval demand for diesel engines and the petroleum crisis of 1942–43, which boosted demand for their coal-fired steam locomotives while acquisition of EMD&#x27;s diesel locomotives was in its most restricted period.

In 1943 Baldwin launched its belated road diesel program, producing a prototype &quot;Centipede&quot; locomotive which was later rebuilt to introduce their first major product in the postwar market.

During World War II Baldwin&#x27;s contributions to the war effort included not only locomotives and switchers but also tanks. Baldwin was one of the manufacturers of several variants of the Light Tank M3 (M3A2, M3A3, M3A5) as well as the Medium Tank M3 (Lee and Grant) and later the M4 Sherman (M4, M4A2). The company also built the M6 Heavy Tank, a prototype trialed by the US Army which never saw operational use.

A Baldwin subsidiary, the Whitcomb Locomotive Company, produced hundreds of 65-ton diesel electric locomotives for the Army and received the Army–Navy &quot;E&quot; award for production. Baldwin ranked 40th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.

===End===
Between 1940 and 1948, domestic steam locomotive sales declined from 30 percent of the market to 2 percent. By 1949, there was no demand for steam locomotives. Baldwin&#x27;s attempts to adapt to the changed market for road locomotives had been unsuccessful; the reliability of their offerings was unsatisfactory, epitomized by notorious failures such as its Centipede diesel locomotives and their steam turbine-electric locomotives, which proved to be money pits unsuited for their intended service. In July 1948 Westinghouse Electric, which had teamed with Baldwin to build diesel and electric locomotives and wanted to keep their main customer in the rail industry afloat, purchased 500,000 shares, or 21 percent, of Baldwin stock, which made Westinghouse Baldwin&#x27;s largest shareholder. Baldwin used the money to cover various debts. Westinghouse vice president Marvin Smith became Baldwin&#x27;s president in May 1949. In a move to diversify into the construction equipment market, Baldwin merged with Lima-Hamilton on December 4, 1950, to become Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton. However, Lima-Hamilton&#x27;s locomotive technology was unused after the merger and market share continued to dwindle. By January, 1952 Baldwin closed its factory in Rochelle, Illinois and consolidated Whitcomb production at Eddystone. In 1953 Westinghouse discontinued building electrical traction equipment, so Baldwin was forced to reconfigure their drive systems based on General Electric equipment. In 1954, during which time they were being virtually shut out of the diesel market, Baldwin delivered one steam turbine-electric locomotive to the Norfolk &amp; Western, which proved unsatisfactory in service.

The last batch of conventional steam locomotives built by BLH were WG class 9100-9149 as BLH 76039-76088 built in 1955 for the Indian Railways broad gauge.

After locomotive production ended, Hamilton continued to develop and produce engines for other purposes. Baldwin engine production was shifted to the Hamilton plant, but in 1960 the Hamilton engines ceased production, the plant was shuttered, and Baldwin engine production moved back to Eddystone. The last locomotives produced by Baldwin were three experimental RP-210 dual power passenger locomotives for the New York Central and New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford rail lines in 1956.

In 1956, after 125 years of continuous locomotive production, Baldwin closed most of its Eddystone plant and ceased producing locomotives. The company instead concentrated on production of heavy construction equipment. More than 70,500 locomotives had been built when production ended. In 1965 Baldwin became a wholly owned subsidiary of Armour &amp; Company. Greyhound Corporation purchased Armour &amp; Company in 1970, and the decision was made to liquidate all production. In 1972 Greyhound closed Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton for good. The replacement and renewal parts business was acquired by Ecolaire Inc and became the Baldwin-Hamilton Company - A Division of Ecolaire Inc. and lasted till 1991 to receive license fees from other companies using their designs, which was lucrative. When the licenses ran out, all remaining parts were distributed, and the company dissolved.

===Later steam locomotives===


Baldwin built many 4-4-0 &quot;American&quot; type locomotives (the locomotive that built America). Surviving examples of which include the 1872 &quot;Countess of Dufferin&quot; and 1875&#x27;s Virginia &amp; Truckee Railroad No.22 &quot;Inyo&quot;, but it was perhaps best known for the 2-8-2 &quot;Mikado&quot; and 2-8-0 &quot;Consolidation&quot; types. It was also well known for the unique cab-forward 4-8-8-2 articulateds built for the Southern Pacific Company and massive 2-10-2 for the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway. Baldwin also produced their most powerful steam engines in history, the 2-8-8-4 &quot;Yellowstone&quot; for the Duluth, Missabe &amp; Iron Range Railway. The Yellowstone could put down over of Tractive force. They routinely hauled 180 car trains weighing over . The Yellowstones were so good that the DM&amp;IR refused to part with them; they hauled ore trains well into the diesel era, and the last one retired in 1963. Three have been preserved. One of Baldwin&#x27;s last new and improved locomotive designs were the 4-8-4 &quot;Northern&quot; locomotives. Baldwin&#x27;s last domestic steam locomotives were 2-6-6-2s built for the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio in 1949. Baldwin 60000, the company&#x27;s 1926 demonstration steam locomotive, is on display at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. On a separate note, the restored and running 2-6-2 steam locomotive at Fort Edmonton Park was built by Baldwin in 1919.

====Preserved Baldwin steam locomotives====
There are many Baldwin built steam locomotives currently operating in the United States, Canada, and several other countries around the world. Out of all the Baldwin built steam locomotives that are operational or have operated in recent years, the most recognized locomotives are Reading 2101, Reading Blue Mountain and Northern 2102, Grand Canyon Railway 4960, Frisco 1522, Frisco 1630, Nickel Plate Road 587, Reading Blue Mountain and Northern 425, Western Maryland Scenic Railroad 734, Southern Pacific 2467, Southern Pacific 2472, Spokane, Portland and Seattle 700, Southern Railway 4501, the oldest surviving 4-8-4 Northern type steam locomotive, Santa Fe 3751, and the last domestic steam locomotive Baldwin built, Chesapeake and Ohio 1309.

In Australia, five of the twenty 59 class Baldwin 2-8-2s which entered service in 1952/53 survive.

Pampanga Sugar Development Company (PASUDECO) No. 2 is in static display as the &quot;Riverland Express&quot; at Riverbanks Center mall in Marikina, Philippines as of October 2022. It is a 2-6-0 built in 1928 by Baldwin and is one of the few surviving tender locomotives in Luzon.

===Narrow-gauge and unconventional===
Baldwin built locomotives for narrow-gauge railways as well. Some of the more notable series built for the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western were outside-framed 2-8-2 &quot;Mikados&quot;: Fifteen class K-27&#x27;s, originally built as Vauclain compounds in 1903, ten class K-36&#x27;s built in 1925, and ten class K-37&#x27;s originally built as standard-gauge 2-8-0s in 1902 but rebuilt for narrow gauge in the D&amp;RGW shops in 1928. Several of all these classes survive, and most are operating today on the Durango &amp; Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and the Cumbres &amp; Toltec Scenic Railroad.

New Zealand Railways (NZR) was a major customer from 1879 when it imported six T class based on the Denver &amp; Rio Grande locomotives due to their similar rail gauge. The next was a double emergency order of six N class and six O class after a British order for similar locomotives failed to meet on-time delivery and weight limitations specified in contract. Baldwins seized on the opportunity to impress the NZR with a prompt six-month delivery of all 12 locomotives. Thereafter NZR ordered Baldwin products to complement home built locomotives, including Wb class and Wd class. Another four of the N class were purchased in 1901. The Ub class class of 22 locomotives consisting of 10 1898 flat valve and 10 1901 piston valve (Baldwins supplying all but two) proved themselves well at the turn of the 20th century with the last retiring as late as 1958. A requirement for a larger firebox version of the class ended up creating a whole new locomotive with the birth of the 4-6-2 wheel arrangement, the Pacific was born. They were classed as Q class and remained in use until 1957. Being a new type of locomotive, the Q class had their shortcomings but eventually performed well. In 1914 a later larger improved version, and last Baldwin product to be purchased by NZR was the Aa class. They lasted until 1959. Like all American locomotives produced at the time, the Baldwins had &#x27;short&#x27; lifespans built into them but the NZR were happy to re-boiler almost their whole fleet to give them a longer life of hard work. NZR were generally happy with their Baldwin fleet. 
A private Railway operating in New Zealand at the time exclusively purchased Baldwin products after facing the same difficulties with British builders the NZR had. The Wellington &amp; Manawatu Railway (1881–1909) operated small fleets of 2-8-0 (4), 2-6-2 (6), 2-8-2 (1), 4-6-0 (2) and a large 2-8-4 (1) tank locomotive. When the NZR took over the railway, its fleet was absorbed into sub-classes of those operating already in the main fleet. When NZR placed tenders for diesel locomotives in the 1950s, Baldwins applied but failed when EMD won the contract instead. Surprisingly only one NZR Baldwin product was operational, a class Wd 2-6-4 tank locomotive operated at the Ferrymead railway in Christchurch until it was taken out of service for repairs, the remains of a WMR 2-6-2 N, NZR 4-6-0 Ub, and two NZR 2-6-2 Wb tank locomotives and one Wd tank locomotive are in the early stages of restoration. Another steam locomotive that is preserved is a steam dummy, built for Sydney Tramways, in 1891, and preserved in operational condition, at Auckland&#x27;s Museum of Transport &amp; Technology.

A six-ton, 60-cm gauge 4-4-0 built for the Tacubaya Railroad in 1897 was the smallest ever built by Baldwin for commercial use.

In the late 1890s, many British builders were recovering from an engineers&#x27; strike over working hours, leaving backlogs of orders yet to be fulfilled. This prompted British railways that were in immediate need for additional motive power to turn to Baldwin and other US builders. Examples of engines built in response include three batches of 2-6-0 tender engines for the Midland Railway, Great Central Railway, and Great Northern Railway, respectively, as well as the Lyn, a 2-4-2T (tank locomotive) for the gauge Lynton &amp; Barnstaple Railway in England in 1898. The Cape Government Railways of South Africa also bought engines from Baldwin as a result of the strikes. Unfortunately, many of these engines were unpopular with the crews due to their designs being atypical, and many, including all of those built for the three standard gauge British railways and the Lynton and Barnstaple&#x27;s Lyn, were scrapped when no longer needed. A replica of the latter locomotive has been constructed for the revived Lynton &amp; Barnstaple Railway.

Also during the late 1890s, two 2-6-2T tank engines A class were built for the Victorian Railways (VR). They were used as a trial on the new narrow-gauge railways. Fifteen more were built by the VR. Both were scrapped.

To supply troops in France, 495 4-6-0PTs were built to the order of the British War Department in 1916/7. After the war surplus locomotives were sold, finding new uses in France, Britain and India.

In Britain examples were used on the Ashover Light Railway, Glyn Valley Tramway, Snailbeach District Railways and the Welsh Highland Railway.

The Welsh Highland Railway in Wales bought No 590, in 1923. It was apparently unpopular with crews although photographs show that it was used regularly until the railway was closed. It was scrapped in 1941 when the derelict railway&#x27;s assets were requisitioned for the war effort. Some of the surviving examples in India have since been imported to the UK, one of which by the Welsh Highland Railway Ltd. who has restored it to represent the scrapped 590. Other Baldwin 4-6-0PT&#x27;s imported from India include one owned by the Leighton Buzzard Light Railway based Greensand Railway Trust that has been restored to working order, as well as two acquired by the Statfold Barn Railway in March 2013.

Baldwin also built six engines for the Pikes Peak Cog Railway, three of which were delivered in 1890, with the fourth being delivered in 1897. These engines featured steeply inclined boilers and used the Abt rack system to propel them up the average 16 percent grade. The last Baldwin engine was taken out of regular service in 1955. During the following years the engines were used as back-up engines and for snow removal. Three of the engines are currently on static display around Colorado. One (No. 1) is located at the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden, Colorado. The other two on display are located in Manitou Springs, Colorado: one (No. 2) near city hall and the other (No. 5) at the Pikes Peak Cog Railway depot. The engine No. 4 is still in limited operation for photo opportunities and special events. However, it no longer completes the journey to the top of Pikes Peak due to the fact that many of the water tanks along the line have been removed. Engines No. 3 and No. 6 were scrapped and used for parts over the years.

Number 6 (builder plate number 12288), a 36&quot; 2-6-0 was built by Baldwin in 1891 for the Surry Sussex &amp; Southampton Railway in Virginia. The SS&amp;S installed Southern valve gear, a graceful outside drive gear. The 6 was eventually sold to the Argent Lumber Company in South Carolina. In 1960, the 6 was purchased by southeastern Iowa&#x27;s Midwest Central Railroad as part of a package deal including the 2 (below). It was the first locomotive to operate on a regular basis at the MCRR and was their main engine until 1971 when it was taken out of service for a major overhaul. Completed in 1988, this ground up rebuild included a new boiler and conversion to oil fire. A &quot;medium&quot; boiler repair was started in 2009, with the work completed in September 2010, in time for the 2010 Midwest Old Thresher&#x27;s Reunion.

The Midwest Central Railroad also owns Number 2, a 36&quot; 2-6-0, which was built for the New Berlin &amp; Winfield Railroad in 1906. The NB&amp;W operated an line in Pennsylvania for an agricultural community. The two hauled freight and passengers on this small operation until the mid-1910s. In 1917, the locomotive was sold to the Argent Lumber Company in South Carolina where it worked along with the 6 in swamp trackage, hauling logs to the mill in Hardeeville. Upon arrival at the MCRR in 1960, it received substantial repairs and was put into service by the early 1970s, replacing number 6 as the MCRR&#x27;s main engine. In 1987, number 2 was taken out of service for a complete rebuild which is still in progress as of January 2011.

The Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR), which runs around the Magic Kingdom in Florida, has four operational Baldwin locomotives: a 1916 Class 8-C 4-4-0 No. 4 (The &quot;Roy O. Disney&quot;), twin locomotives Nos. 1 and 3, both 1925 Class 10-D 4-6-0 designs (The &quot;Walter E. Disney&quot; and the &quot;Roger E. Broggie&quot;, respectively), and a 1928 Class 8-D 2-6-0 No. 2 (The &quot;Lilly Belle&quot;). They all originally worked on the Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucatán (UdeY), a railroad that operated in the state of Yucatán in Mexico. In the late 1960s, they were all purchased by Disney imagineers Roger Broggie and Earl Vilmer for $8,000 each and rebuilt to operating condition, while significantly altered from their original appearance to resemble steam locomotives from the 1880s. Three other operational Disney-owned Baldwin locomotives (No. 3 &quot;Fred Gurley&quot;, No. 4 &quot;Ernest S. Marsh&quot;, and No. 5 &quot;Ward Kimball&quot;) operate on the Disneyland Railroad, where they run around Disneyland in California alongside two additional locomotives built by WED Enterprises.

Baldwin also built many boilers and stationary steam engines for heating and powering buildings and industry.

===Street railways and tramway steam motors===
As well as railway locomotives, Baldwin built street tramway steam motors in large numbers for operators in the United States and worldwide. There were three basic models, with 9-inch, 11-inch and 13-inch motors, the sizes being determined by the cylinder size rather than the boiler capacity. These were largely superseded by electric tramcars, but some were built and operated well into the 20th century for systems that were never electrified. There were well over 100 built for the New South Wales Government Tramways in Sydney, Australia from 1879 to 1910. Mostly 11&quot; and 0-4-0 in configuration.

Two operational NSWGT surviving steam motors:
* Baldwin 11676 of 1891 NSWGT No. 103 Valley Heights Steam Tramway, New South Wales, Australia.
* Baldwin 11665 of 1891 NSWGT No. 100 Museum of Transport &amp; Technology, Auckland, NZ. No.100 was latterly used in Wanganui, New Zealand 1910–1950.

Other Baldwin steam motor operators included:
*The Takapuna Tramways and Ferry Company, Auckland, New Zealand 1910–1927. Route was from Bayswater to Milford via Takapuna and Lake Pupuke. No surviving locomotives.

===Electric locomotives===
From the early years of the 20th century Baldwin had a relationship with the Westinghouse Electric Company to build electric locomotives for the American market. The electric locomotive was increasingly popular; electrification was expensive, but for high traffic levels or mountainous terrain it could pay for itself, and in addition some cities like New York, were banning the steam locomotive because of its pollution and the propensity for accidents in smoke-choked terminals. Baldwin built or subcontracted out the bodywork and running gear, and Westinghouse built the electrical gear. Both combined to have a similar arrangement with the Netherlands and Werkspoor for the foreign markets.

Baldwin built the famed EP-1 (1906), EF-1 (1912) and EP-2 (1923) box cab electric locomotives for the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad. Baldwin also delivered the EP-3 box cab electric locomotives to the Milwaukee Road for use on its line between Harlowton, Montana, and Avery, Idaho.

Baldwin built several electric locomotive types for the Pennsylvania Railroad as well including the P5A, R1 and the famed GG1. Baldwin built the first GG1 prototype electric locomotive for use on the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s electrified line, which was completed in 1935 between New York and Washington, D.C.

===Steam-turbine locomotives===
In the waning years of steam Baldwin also undertook several attempts at alternative technologies to diesel power. In 1944 Baldwin outshopped an S2 class 6-8-6 steam turbine locomotive for the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Between 1947 and 1948 Baldwin built three coal-fired steam turbine-electric locomotives of a unique design, for passenger service on the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio (C&amp;O), who numbered them 500 to 502 and classified them M-1. The units, which were equipped with Westinghouse electrical systems and had a 2-C1+2-C1-B wheel arrangement, were long, making them the longest locomotives ever built for passenger service. The cab was mounted in the center, with a coal bunker ahead of it and a backwards-mounted boiler behind it, the tender only carrying water. These locomotives were intended for a route from Washington, D.C., to Cincinnati, but could never travel the whole route without some sort of failure. Coal dust and water frequently got into the traction motors. These problems could have been fixed given time, but it was obvious that these locomotives would always be expensive to maintain, and all three were scrapped in 1950.

In May 1954 Baldwin built a steam turbine-electric locomotive for freight service on the Norfolk &amp; Western (N&amp;W), nicknamed the &quot;Jawn Henry&quot; after the legend of John Henry, a steel-driver on a track crew who famously raced against a steam drill and won, only to die immediately afterwards. The unit was similar in appearance to the C&amp;O turbines but very different mechanically; it had a C+C-C+C wheel arrangement, and an improved watertube boiler which was fitted with automatic controls. Unfortunately the boiler controls were sometimes problematic, and, as with the C&amp;O turbines, coal dust and water got into the motors. &quot;Jawn Henry&quot; was retired from the N&amp;W roster on January 4, 1958.

=== Diesel-electric locomotives ===

Though fairly successful in the marketplace, Baldwin diesels did not do so well as others. Thanks to their robust Westinghouse electrical gear, they were excellent haulers, but the diesel prime movers were less reliable than comparable EMD and Alco products. The company remained fond of steam power and was slow to make the jump to building reliable diesel road locomotives. By the late 1940s, Baldwin&#x27;s main diesel competitors – Alco, EMD and Fairbanks-Morse – had each settled on four or five standard locomotive models, which were suitable for assembly-line construction. Baldwin, meanwhile, was the sole manufacturer to continue the steam-era practice of offering bespoke locomotive designs at the request of individual railroads. This resulted in a large number of diesel models, most of which had a small number of units (aside from switcher locomotives, only a few models had more than 50 examples). This put Baldwin at a competitive disadvantage since it was unable to benefit from economies of scale, consistent quality control, or the evolution of each model, which its competitors enjoyed. Even the construction could vary between units of the same model, especially if they were not built in sequence. The last Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton diesels were delivered in 1956.

===Gas turbine-electric locomotives===
In April 1950, Baldwin and Westinghouse completed an experimental gas turbine locomotive, numbered 4000, known as the &quot;Blue Goose&quot;, with a B-B-B-B wheel arrangement. The locomotive used two turbine engines fueled by Bunker C fuel oil, was equipped for passenger train heating with a steam generator that utilized the waste exhaust heat of the right hand turbine, and was geared for . While it was demonstrated successfully in both freight and passenger service on the PRR, MKT, and CNW, no production orders followed, and it was scrapped in 1953.
