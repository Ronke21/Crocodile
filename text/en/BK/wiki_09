<doc id="376118" wikidata="Q14390274" url="?curid=376118" title="Tango music">
<text>Tango is a style of music in or time that originated among European and African immigrant populations of Argentina and Uruguay (collectively, the &quot;Rioplatenses&quot;). It is traditionally played on a solo guitar, guitar duo, or an ensemble, known as the &quot;orquesta típica&quot;, which includes at least two violins, flute, piano, double bass, and at least two bandoneóns. Sometimes guitars and a clarinet join the ensemble. Tango may be purely instrumental or may include a vocalist. Tango music and dance have become popular throughout the world.

==Origins==
Even though present forms of tango developed in Argentina and Uruguay from the mid-19th century, there are records of 19th and early 20th-century tango styles in Cuba and Spain, while there is a flamenco tango dance that may share a common ancestor in a minuet-style European dance. All sources stress the influence of African communities and their rhythms, while the instruments and techniques brought in by European immigrants in the 20th century played a major role in the style&#x27;s final definition, relating it to the salon music styles to which tango would contribute back at a later stage.

Ángel Villoldo&#x27;s 1903 tango &quot;El Choclo&quot; was first recorded no later than 1906 in Philadelphia. Villoldo himself recorded it in Paris (possibly in April 1908, with the Orchestre Tzigane du Restaurant du Rat Mort), as there were no recording studios in Argentina at the time.

Early tango was played by European immigrants in Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The first generation of tango players from Buenos Aires was called &quot;Guardia Vieja&quot; (the Old Guard). It took time to move into wider circles; in the early 20th century, it was the favorite music of thugs and gangsters who visited brothels, in a city with 100,000 more men than women (in 1914). The complex dances that arose from such rich music reflect how the men would practice the dance in groups, demonstrating male sexuality and causing a blending of emotion and aggressiveness. The music was played on portable instruments: flute, guitar, and violin trios, with bandoneón arriving at the end of the 19th century. The organito, a portable player-organ, broadened the popularity of certain songs. Eduardo Arolas was the major driver of the bandoneón&#x27;s popularization, with Vicente Greco soon standardizing the tango sextet as consisting of piano, double bass, two violins, and two bandoneóns.

Like many forms of popular music, tango was associated with the underclass, and attempts were made to restrict its influence. In spite of the scorn, some, like writer Ricardo Güiraldes, were fans. Güiraldes played a part in the international popularization of tango, which had conquered the world by the end of World War I; he wrote the poem &quot;Tango&quot;, which describes the music as the &quot;all-absorbing love of a tyrant, jealously guarding his dominion, over women who have surrendered submissively, like obedient beasts&quot;.

One song that would become the most widely known of all tango melodies also dates from this time. The first two sections of &quot;La Cumparsita&quot; were composed as an instrumental march in 1916 by teenaged Gerardo Matos Rodríguez of Uruguay.

==Argentine roots of tango==
Besides the global influences mentioned above, early tango was locally influenced by Payada, the Milonga from Argentine and Uruguay pampas, and Uruguayan candombe. In Argentina there was Milonga &quot;from the country&quot; since the mid eighteenth century. The first &quot;payador&quot; remembered is Santos Vega. The origins of Milonga seem to be in the pampa with strong African influences, especially though the local candombe (which would be related to its contemporary candombe in Buenos Aires and Montevideo). It is believed that this candombe existed and was practised in Argentina since the first slaves were brought into the country.

Although the word &quot;tango&quot; to describe a music/dance style had been printed as early as 1823 in Havana, Cuba, the first Argentine written reference is from an 1866 newspaper that quotes the song &quot;La Coqueta&quot; (an Argentine tango). In 1876, a tango-candombe called &quot;El Merenguengué&quot; became very popular, after its success in the Afro-Argentines&#x27; carnival held in February of that year. It is played with harp, violin, and flute, in addition to the Afro-Argentine candombe drums (&quot;Llamador&quot; and &quot;Repicador&quot;). This has been seriously considered one of the strong points of departure for the birth and development of tango.

The first tango &quot;group&quot; was composed of two Afro-Argentines: &quot;the black&quot; Casimiro Alcorta (violin) and &quot;the mulatto&quot; Sinforoso (clarinet). They played small concerts in Buenos Aires from the early 1870s until the early 1890s. Alcorta is the author of &quot;Entrada Prohibida&quot; (Prohibited Entry), sung by the brothers Teisseire. He is also credited with the tango &quot;Concha sucia&quot;, which was later adapted and sung by F. Canaro as &quot;Cara sucia&quot; (Dirty Face).

Before the 1900s, the following tangos were being played: &quot;El queco&quot; (anonymous, attributed to clarinetist Lino Galeano in 1885); &quot;Señora casera&quot; (anonymous, 1880); &quot;Andate a la recoleta&quot; (anonymous, 1880); &quot;El Porteñito&quot; (by the Spaniard Gabriel Diez in 1880); &quot;Tango Nº1&quot; (Jose Machado, 1883); &quot;Dame la lata&quot; (Juan Perez, 1888); &quot;Que polvo con tanto viento&quot; (anonymous, 1890); &quot;No me tires con la tapa de la olla&quot; (A.A. 1893); and &quot;El Talar&quot; (Prudencio Aragon, 1895). One of the first women to write tango scores was Eloísa D&#x27;Herbil. She wrote such pieces as &quot;Y a mí qué&quot; (What Do I Care), &quot;Che no calotiés!&quot; (Hey, No Stealing!), and others, between 1872 and 1885.

The first recorded musical score is &quot;La Canguela&quot; (1889). The first copyrighted tango score is &quot;El entrerriano&quot;, released in 1896 and printed in 1898 by Rosendo Mendizabal, an Afro-Argentine. As for the transition between the old &quot;Tango criollo&quot; (Milonga from the pampas, evolved with touches of Afro-Argentine candombe, and some Habanera), and the tango of the Old Guard, there are the following songs:
* Ángel Villoldo - &quot;El choclo&quot;, 1903; &quot;El Pimpolla&quot;, 1904; &quot;La Vida del Carretero&quot;, 1905; and &quot;El Negro Alegre&quot;, 1907
* Gabino Ezeiza - &quot;El Tango Patagones&quot;, 1905
* Higinio Cazón - &quot;El Taita&quot;, 1905

Moreover, the first tango recorded by an orchestra was &quot;Don Juan&quot;, whose author is Ernesto Ponzio. It was recorded by the orchestra of Vicente Greco.

==1920s and 1930s, Carlos Gardel==
Tango soon gained popularity in Europe, beginning in France. Superstar Carlos Gardel soon became a sex symbol who brought tango to new audiences, especially in the United States, due to his sensual depictions of the dance in film. In the 1920s, tango moved out of the lower-class brothels and became a more respectable form of music and dance. Bandleaders like Roberto Firpo and Francisco Canaro dropped the flute and added a double bass in its place. Lyrics were still typically macho, blaming women for countless heartaches, and the dance moves were still sexual and aggressive.

Carlos Gardel became especially associated with the transition from a lower-class &quot;gangster&quot; music to a respectable middle-class dance. He helped develop tango-canción in the 1920s and became one of the most popular tango artists of all time. He was also one of the precursors of the &quot;Golden Age of Tango&quot;.

Gardel&#x27;s death was followed by a division into movements within tango. Evolutionists like Aníbal Troilo and Carlos di Sarli were opposed to traditionalists like Rodolfo Biagi and Juan d&#x27;Arienzo.

==Golden Age==
The &quot;Golden Age&quot; of tango music and dance is generally agreed to have been the period from about 1935 to 1952, roughly contemporaneous with the big band era in the United States. Tango was performed by orquestas típicas, bands often including over a dozen performers.

Some of the many popular and influential orchestras included those of Mariano Mores, Juan d&#x27;Arienzo, Francisco Canaro, and Aníbal Troilo. D&#x27;Arienzo was called the &quot;Rey del compás&quot; or &quot;King of the beat&quot;, for the insistent, driving rhythm which can be heard on many of his recordings. &quot;El flete&quot; is an excellent example of D&#x27;Arienzo&#x27;s approach. Canaro&#x27;s early milongas are generally the slowest and easiest to dance to; and for that reason, they are the most frequently played at tango dances (milongas); &quot;Milonga Sentimental&quot; is a classic example.

Beginning in the Golden Age and continuing afterwards, the orchestras of Osvaldo Pugliese and Carlos di Sarli made many recordings. Di Sarli had a lush, grandiose sound, and emphasized strings and piano over the bandoneón, which is heard in &quot;A la gran muñeca&quot; and &quot;Bahía Blanca&quot; (the name of his home town).

Pugliese&#x27;s first recordings were not too different from those of other dance orchestras, but he developed a complex, rich, and sometimes discordant sound, which is heard in his signature pieces &quot;Gallo ciego&quot;, &quot;Emancipación&quot;, and &quot;La yumba&quot;. Pugliese&#x27;s later music was played for an audience and not intended for dancing, although it is often used for stage choreography for its dramatic potential, and sometimes played late at night at milongas.

Eventually, tango transcended its Latin boundaries as European bands adopted it into their dance repertoires. Non-traditional instruments were often added, such as the accordion (in place of the bandoneon), saxophone, clarinet, ukulele, mandolin, electric organ, etc., as well as lyrics in non-Spanish languages. European tango became a mainstream worldwide dance and popular music style, alongside foxtrot, slow waltz, and rumba. It somewhat diverged from its Argentinian origin and developed characteristic European styles. Famous European band leaders who adopted tango included, to name a few, , Marek Weber, Oskar Joost, , Jose Lucchesi, , , Paul Godwin, Alexander Tsfasman, as well as famous singers Leo Monosson, Zarah Leander, Rudi Schuricke, Tino Rossi, , Mieczysław Fogg, Pyotr Leshchenko, and others. The popularity of European tango precipitously declined with the advent of rock-n-roll in the 1950s–60s.

==Tango nuevo==
The later age of tango has been dominated by Ástor Piazzolla, whose &quot;Adiós nonino&quot; became the most influential work of tango music since Carlos Gardel&#x27;s &quot;El día que me quieras&quot; was released in 1935. During the 1950s, Piazzolla consciously tried to create a more academic form with new sounds breaking the classic forms of tango, drawing the derision of purists and old-time performers. The 1970s saw Buenos Aires developing a fusion of jazz and tango. Litto Nebbia and Siglo XX were especially popular within this movement. In the 1970s and 1980s, the vocal octet Buenos Aires 8 recorded classic tangos in elaborate arrangements, with complex harmonies and jazz influence, and also recorded an album with compositions by Piazzolla.

The so-called post-Piazzolla generation (1980–) includes musicians such as Dino Saluzzi, Rodolfo Mederos, Gustavo Beytelmann, and Juan Jose Mosalini. Piazzolla and his followers developed nuevo tango, a musical genre that incorporated jazz and classical influences into a more experimental style.

In the late 1990s, composer and pianist Fernando Otero continued to add elements to the innovation process which had started decades ago, expanding the orchestration and form while including improvisation and atonal aspects in his work.

==1990s–2000s tango==
In the second half of the 1990s, a new movement of tango composers and tango orchestras playing new songs was born in Buenos Aires. It was mainly influenced by the old orchestra style rather than by Piazzolla’s renewal and experiments with electronic music.

Over the first two decades of the 21st century, the movement has grown with the creation of countless bands playing new tangos. The most prominent figures leading this phenomenon have been the Orquesta Típica Fernandez Fierro, whose creator, Julian Peralta, would later start Astillero and the Orquesta Típica Julián Peralta. Other bands have also become part of the movement, such as Orquesta Rascacielos, Altertango, Ciudad Baigón, as well as singer-songwriters Alfredo &quot;Tape&quot; Rubín, Victoria di Raimondo, Juan Serén, Natalí de Vicenzo, and Pacha González.

==Neotango==
Tango development did not stop with tango nuevo. 21st-century tango is referred to as neotango. These recent trends can be described as &quot;electro tango&quot; or &quot;tango fusion&quot;, where the electronic influences range from subtle to dominant.

Tanghetto and Carlos Libedinsky are good examples of the subtle use of electronic elements. The music still has its tango feeling, the complex rhythmic and melodious entanglement that makes tango so unique. Gotan Project is a group that formed in 1999 in Paris, consisting of musicians Philippe Cohen Solal, Eduardo Makaroff, and Christoph H. Muller. Their releases include &quot;Vuelvo al Sur/El capitalismo foráneo&quot; (2000), &quot;La Revancha del Tango&quot; (2001), &quot;Inspiración Espiración&quot; (2004), and &quot;Lunático&quot; (2006). Their sound features electronic elements like samples, beats, and sounds on top of a tango groove. Some dancers enjoy dancing to this music, although many traditional dancers regard it as a definite break in style and tradition.

Bajofondo Tango Club is another example of electro-tango. Further examples can be found on the CDs &quot;Tango?&quot;, &quot;Hybrid Tango&quot;, &quot;Tangophobia Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Tango Crash&quot; (with a major jazz influence), &quot;Latin Tango&quot; by Rodrigo Favela (featuring classic and modern elements), &quot;NuTango&quot;, &quot;Tango Fusion Club Vol. 1&quot; by the creator of the milonga called &quot;Tango Fusion Club&quot; in Munich, &quot;Felino&quot; by the Norwegian group Electrocutango, and &quot;Electronic Tango&quot;, a compilation CD. In 2004, the music label World Music Network released a collection under the title &quot;The Rough Guide to Tango Nuevo&quot;.

==Musical impact and classical interpreters==
Although tango music was strictly circumscribed to the tango interpreters, it was the classically trained Argentinian pianist Arminda Canteros (1911–2002) who used to play tangos to satisfy the requests of her father, who could not understand classical music. She developed her own style and had a weekly program of tango music for a radio station in Rosario, Argentina in the 1930s and 1940s. Since tango playing was considered the epitome of machismo, she had to take the masculine pseudonym &quot;Juancho&quot; for the broadcasts.

Canteros settled in New York City in 1970, where in 1989, she recorded the album &quot;Tangos&quot;, at the age of 78.
Following Cantero’s example, another Argentinian female pianist brought tango music to the concert halls: Cecilia Pillado played a complete tango recital at the Berliner Philharmonie in 1997 and recorded that program for her CD &quot;Cexilia’s Tangos&quot;.

Since then, tango has become part of the repertoire for great classical musicians like the baritone Jorge Chaminé with his &quot;Tangos&quot;, recorded with bandoneónist Olivier Manoury. Additionally, al Tango, Yo-Yo Ma, Martha Argerich, Daniel Barenboim, Gidon Kremer, Plácido Domingo, and Marcelo Álvarez have performed and recorded tangos.

Some classical composers have written tangos, such as Isaac Albéniz in &quot;España&quot; (1890), Erik Satie in &quot;Le Tango perpétuel&quot; (1914), and Igor Stravinsky in &quot;Histoire du Soldat&quot; (1918). Nikolai Myaskovsky composed an Argentinian death tango for the poem &quot;War and Peace&quot;. Kurt Weill continued this style in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (1928) (Die Dreigroschenoper), with &quot;Tango Ballade&quot;, or &quot;Zuhälterballade&quot;, a fateful song about underworld life (a symphonic version commissioned by Otto Klemperer); a bit later, he composed &quot;Youkali&quot; (Tango-Habanera), with French lyrics. Also noteworthy was the accordionist John Serry Sr., who composed &quot;Tango of Love&quot; and &quot;Petite Tango&quot; for accordion quartet (1955). The list of composers who wrote inspired by tango music also includes John Cage in &quot;Perpetual Tango&quot; (1984), John Harbison in &quot;Tango Seen from Ground Level&quot; (1991), and Milton Babbitt in &quot;It Takes Twelve to Tango&quot; (1984). The influence of Piazzolla has fallen on a number of contemporary composers. The &quot;Tango Mortale&quot; in &quot;Arcadiana&quot; by Thomas Adès is an example.

Many popular songs in the United States have borrowed melodies from tango: the earliest published tango, &quot;El Choclo&quot;, lent its melody to the fifties hit &quot;Kiss of Fire&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Adiós Muchachos&quot; became &quot;I Get Ideas&quot;, and &quot;Strange Sensation&quot; was based on &quot;La Cumparsita&quot;.

Showing tango music&#x27;s continued popularity, multiple international radio stations broadcast nonstop tango music today.

<doc id="376131" wikidata="Q38489" url="?curid=376131" title="Lord Mayor's Show">
<text>The Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show is one of the best-known annual events in London as well as one of the longest-established, dating back to the 13th century. A new lord mayor is appointed every year, and the public parade that takes place as their inauguration ceremony reflects that this was once one of the most prominent offices in England and subsequently the United Kingdom.

The show is named after the Lord Mayor of the City of London, a city and ceremonial county within Greater London and the historic centre of the wider metropolis. This is distinct from the Mayor of London, the elected head of the Greater London Authority (a position which has existed only since 2000). The City is London&#x27;s main financial district, widely known informally as &#x27;the Square Mile&#x27;.

The Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show is centred on a street parade, which in its modern form is a light-hearted combination of traditional British pageantry and elements of carnival. On the day after being sworn in, the Lord Mayor and several others participate in a procession from Guildhall, via Mansion House and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, in the heart of the City of London, to the Royal Courts of Justice on the edge of the City of Westminster, where the new Lord Mayor swears allegiance to the Crown. Until 1882, the procession went to Westminster Hall.

==Origin and date of the show==

The office of Lord Mayor dates from 1189, and it was a requirement of the charter establishing it that the mayor travelled to the royal enclave at Westminster to present himself to the monarch&#x27;s representatives, the senior judges as Barons of the Exchequer, to take an oath of loyalty to the sovereign upon beginning his term. The event is officially listed in the City&#x27;s Civic Calendar as &#x27;The Procession to the Royal Courts of Justice and Presentation of the Lord Mayor to the Chief Justices&#x27;; when the Royal Courts moved from Westminster to the Strand location in 1882, the route was shortened. Originally, this journey was mostly made by barge on the River Thames, the usual method of transport for this route in those days. Pageantry and display gradually grew around the trip, comparable to the far less frequent Royal Entry parades that usually followed a coronation or royal wedding. 

In the 16th century the &quot;show&quot; become a major entertainment for Londoners. This rests significantly on the shoulders of the Lord Mayors Sir Rowland Hill and his friend Sir John Gresham, in revival of the Marching Watch or Mid Summer Watches in London. In these pageants 15,000 citizens all in bright harness, with coats of white Silk or Cloath, and Chains of Gold, passed through London to Westminster, and round St. James&#x27;s Park, and on to Holborn. The long daylight of June caused the civic government to fear disorder; the Watch was originally a show of the city&#x27;s policing force with armed men marching in the streets., but it evolved into an annual festival of street pageantry which reached its spectacular peak in Hill&#x27;s time and evolved into the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show. These developments are recorded in Lady Long&#x27;s household-book at Hengrave, Suffolk, which notes that Henry VIII watched these marches from Mercers Hall with Jane Seymour; &quot;the presence of more than 300 demi lunces and light horsemen&quot; were a particular highlight.

In London, the show occurred annually on 29 October. In 1751, Great Britain replaced the Julian calendar with the Gregorian calendar; the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show was then moved to 9 November. In 1959, another change was made: the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show is now held on the second Saturday in November. The Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show has regularly been held on the scheduled day, having only been cancelled twice, firstly in 1852, when the show made way for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington&#x27;s funeral and secondly in 2020 when the show was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The modern Lord Mayor&#x27;s procession is a direct descendant of that first journey to Westminster.

==The Lord Mayor&#x27;s transport and the origin of parade floats==
Formerly, the route was varied each year so that the procession could pass through the Lord Mayor&#x27;s home ward; since 1952, however, the route has been fixed. The Lord Mayor rode on horseback, rode in a coach, or went on a barge via the River Thames, based on the route chosen. The river transport for the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show gave rise to the word &quot;float&quot; when used in the context of parades.

On more than one occasion, floats have been used as puns on the Lord Mayor&#x27;s name; in 1616 John Leman had a lemon tree in the procession, while the following year William Cockayne had an artificial cock crowing and flapping its wings. More recently, Sir Murray Fox in 1974 had a large model of a fox in the procession.
In 1711, Lord Mayor Gilbert Heathcote was unseated from his horse, breaking his leg, after which a coach was used. A coach was hired for the purpose until 1757 when Sir Charles Asgill, a banker who became the next Lord Mayor, commissioned Joseph Berry of Leather Lane in Holborn to make the Lord Mayor of London&#x27;s State Coach which is still used today. The original cost of £1,065.0s.3d. equates to around £120,000, but the replacement value has been estimated at £2 million. The side panels of the coach were painted by Cipriani, who also painted those for the monarch&#x27;s Gold State Coach. It is pulled by six horses, two fewer than the monarch&#x27;s. Riding postillion on the Lord Mayor&#x27;s State Carriage are two winners of the annual Doggett&#x27;s Coat and Badge rowing race. An escort to the coach recalls the waterborne transport of the Lord Mayor; they were liveried watermen carrying oars: formerly, the Mayor&#x27;s barge was rowed by members of the Company of Watermen and Lightermen.

==Participants in the show==

===Great Twelve Livery Companies===
The Great Twelve City Livery Companies — the Mercers, Grocers, Drapers, Fishmongers, Goldsmiths, Merchant Taylors*, Skinners*, Haberdashers, Salters, Ironmongers, Vintners and Clothworkers — participate as of right and the other livery companies by invitation, though the Lord Mayor&#x27;s &quot;mother company&quot; is always included: in 2019 this was the Haberdashers&#x27; Company.

===Privileged regiments of the City of London and others===

Other participants include bands and members of &quot;privileged regiments&quot; of the City of London such as the Honourable Artillery Company and The Royal Fusiliers. Privileged regiments have the right to march through the City with bayonets fixed, colours flying, and drums beating.

The many other participants lend a unique flavour to the occasion which include organisations that the Lord Mayor wishes to support or has belonged to, such as charities, old schools and business associations before becoming Lord Mayor. St John Ambulance participates, for instance, as do the Zurich Guilds.

Gog and Magog are two woven willow giant reproductions of a pair of statues in the Guildhall. These popular icons reflect the pre-Roman legendary past of the City of London and they too are paraded by volunteers from The Guild of Young Freemen each year. The most recent representations were created by members of the Worshipful Company of Basketmakers.

==Schedule==

The procession begins at the Guildhall where the Lord Mayor receives with the new Sheriffs personal gifts from a restricted group of relevant City institutions, usually including the Lord Mayor&#x27;s own Livery Company and Ward Club and then there is a breakfast. The Lord Mayor is escorted to their coach in Guildhall Yard by the Court of Aldermen and sets off to Mansion House, the official residence of the Lord Mayor. There the Lord Mayor awaits the show to pass from the terrace. The Lord Mayor joins the rear of the show, after having watched a flypast by the Royal Air Force. 

The route of the outward parade in 2013 was from Guildhall, along Princes Street to Bank junction and past Mansion House. From there the procession travelled down Poultry, Cheapside, New Change, St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, Ludgate Hill, Fleet Street and the Strand.

Along the route, the Lord Mayor stops at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in order to receive a blessing from the Dean on the Cathedral steps. Upon arrival at the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand, the Lord Mayor takes the oath of allegiance. The return procession then reassembles on Aldwych and returns via Essex Street to Temple Place then along the Victoria Embankment and Queen Victoria Street back to Mansion House where the Lord Mayor takes review of the Pikemen and Musketeers of the Honorable Artillery Company. The Lord Mayor then re-enters Mansion House via the steps to the Terrace with the Aldermen and entertains guests and volunteers who have co-ordinated the event.

The parade, which typically begins at about 11 am, concludes at about 3:30 pm. The procession is over 3 miles (roughly 5 km) long but the route itself is much shorter; the head of the procession reaches the end of the route before the Lord Mayor even leaves Mansion House. In the evening, a fireworks display is held subject to weather conditions.

==Televising==
The Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show is televised live by the BBC in a special programme typically broadcast on BBC One, it has been broadcast on the BBC since 1937 making it the longest running television broadcast worldwide. The broadcast is focused around Mansion House, watching the procession as it passes and the Lord Mayor watches, it starts just before the Lord Mayor arrives and ends when he leaves, interviewers abound the proceedings, the blessing at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the Oath at the Royal Courts of Justice are left out completely.

<text>The Ordinance of Nullification declared the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 null and void within the borders of the U.S. state of South Carolina, beginning on February 1, 1833. It began the Nullification Crisis. Passed by a state convention on November 24, 1832, it led to President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s proclamation against South Carolina, the Nullification Proclamation on December 10, 1832, which threatened to send government troops to enforce the tariffs. In the face of the military threat, and following a Congressional revision of the law which lowered the tariff, South Carolina repealed the ordinance.

The protest that led to the Ordinance of Nullification was caused by the belief that the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 favored the North over the South and therefore violated the Constitution. This led to an emphasis on the differences between the two regions and helped set the stage for conflict during the antebellum era, eventually leading to the American Civil War.

<text>The National Grange, a.k.a. The Grange, officially named The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, is a social organization in the United States that encourages families to band together to promote the economic and political well-being of the community and agriculture. The Grange, founded after the Civil War in 1867, is the oldest American agricultural advocacy group with a national scope. The Grange actively lobbied state legislatures and Congress for political goals, such as the Granger Laws to lower rates charged by railroads, and rural free mail delivery by the Post Office.

In 2005, the Grange had a membership of 160,000, with organizations in 2,100 communities in 36 states. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., in a building built by the organization in 1960. Many rural communities in the United States still have a Grange Hall and local Granges still serve as a center of rural life for many farming communities.

==History==
The commissioner of the Department of Agriculture commissioned Oliver Kelley, after a personal interview with President Andrew Johnson, to go to the Southern states and to collect data to improve Southern agricultural conditions. In the South, poor farmers bore the brunt of the Civil War and were suspicious of Northerners like Kelley. Kelley found he was able to overcome these sectional differences as a Mason. With Southern Masons as guides, he toured the war-torn countryside in the South and was appalled by the outdated farming practices. In the western states, Kelley deplored the lack of &quot;progressive agriculture&quot;, with illiterate &quot;ignorant&quot; farmers who were &quot;using a system of farming [that] was the same as that handed down by generations gone by&quot;. He saw the need for an organization that would bring people together from across the country in a spirit of mutual cooperation. After many letters and consultations with the other founders, the Grange was born. The first Grange, Grange #1, was founded in 1868 in Fredonia, New York. Seven men and one woman co-founded the Grange: Oliver Hudson Kelley, William Saunders, Francis M. McDowell, John Trimble, Aaron B. Grosh, John R. Thompson, William M. Ireland, and Caroline Hall. In 1873 the organization was united under a National Grange in Washington, D.C.

Paid agents organized local Granges and membership in the Grange increased dramatically from 1873 (200,000) to 1875 (858,050). Many of the state and local granges adopted non-partisan political resolutions, especially regarding the regulation of railroad transportation costs. The organization was unusual at this time, because women and any teen old enough to draw a plow (aged 14 to 16) were encouraged to participate. The importance of women was reinforced by requiring that four of the elected positions could be held only by women.
Rapid growth infused the national organization with money from dues, and many local granges established consumers&#x27; co-operatives, initially supplied by the wholesaler Aaron Montgomery Ward. Poor fiscal management, combined with organizational difficulties resulting from rapid growth, led to a massive decline in membership. By the turn of the 20th century, the Grange rebounded and membership stabilized.

The Granger movement supported efforts by politicians to regulate rates charged by the railroads and grain warehouses. It claimed credit for the ideas of the Cooperative Extension Service, Rural Free Delivery, and the Farm Credit System. The peak of their political reputation was marked by the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot; (1877), which held that grain warehouses were a &quot;private utility in the public interest,&quot; and so could be regulated by public law. However this achievement was overturned later by the Supreme Court in &quot;Wabash v. Illinois&quot; (1886). The Grange also endorsed the temperance cause to avoid alcohol, the direct election of Senators and women&#x27;s suffrage.

===Partisan politics===
While the Grange was not a political party, Grangers were involved in several political movements in the Midwestern United States in the late 19th century, such as the Reform Party of Wisconsin.

===Decline in membership===
Grange membership has declined considerably as the percentage of American farmers has fallen from a third of the population in the early 20th century to less than two percent today. Between 1992 and 2007, the number of Grange members fell by 40%, largely due to the National Grange no longer offering insurance for its members. Washington has the largest membership of any state, at approximately 13,000.

In 2022, the National Grange reported a net gain in membership for the first time in almost seven decades.

==Today==

, the Grange continues to press for the causes of farmers, including issues of free trade and farm policy. In its 2006 &quot;Journal of Proceedings&quot;, the organization&#x27;s report on its annual convention, the organization lays out its mission and how it works towards achieving it through fellowship, service, and legislation:
In February 2024, the National Grange revised their Mission Statement:
As a non-partisan organization, the Grange supports only policies, never political parties or candidates. Although the Grange was founded to serve the interests of farmers, because of the shrinking farm population the Grange has begun to broaden its range to include a wide variety of issues, and anyone is welcome to join the Grange.

The Junior Grange is open to children 5–14. Regular Grange membership is open to anyone age 14 or older. The Grange Youth, a group within the Grange, consists of members 13 1/2 to 30.

In 2013, the Grange signed on to a letter to Congress calling for the doubling of legal immigration and legalization for undocumented immigrants currently in the United States. However, this position has been somewhat revised, and the Grange now emphasizes an expansion in the H-2A visa program to increase legal immigration and address the crisis-level labor shortage in agriculture. They support the enforcement of immigration law but urge discretion with regard to the impact on labor availability.

==Rituals and ceremonies==

When the Grange first began in 1867, it borrowed some of its rituals and symbols from Freemasonry, including oaths, secret meetings, and special passwords necessary to keep railroad spies out of their meetings. It also copied ideas from Greek, Roman and Biblical mythology. Small, ceremonial farm tools are often displayed at Grange meetings. Elected officers are in charge of opening and closing each meeting. There are seven degrees of Grange membership; the ceremony of each degree relates to the seasons and various symbols and principles.

During the last few decades, the Grange has moved toward public meetings and no longer meets in secret. Though the secret meetings do not occur, the Grange still acknowledges its rich history and practices some traditions.

==Organization==

The Grange is a hierarchical organization ranging from local communities to the National Grange organization. At the local level are community Granges, otherwise known as &quot;subordinate Granges&quot;. All members are affiliated with at least one subordinate. In most states, multiple subordinate Granges are grouped together to form &quot;Pomona Granges&quot;. Typically, Pomona Granges are made up of all the subordinates in a county. Next in the order come State Granges, which is where the Grange begins to be especially active in the political process. State Masters (Presidents) are responsible for supervising the administration of Subordinate and Pomona Granges. Together, thirty-five State Granges, as well as Potomac Grange #1 in Washington, D.C., form the National Grange. The National Grange represents the interests of most Grangers in lobbying activities similar to the state, but on a much larger scale. In addition, the National Grange oversees the Grange ritual. The Grange is a grassroots organization; virtually all policy originates at the subordinate level.

The motto of the Grange is &quot;In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas&quot; (&quot;In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, charity&quot;). Indeed, the word &quot;grange&quot; comes from a Latin word for grain, and is related to a &quot;granary&quot; or, generically, a farm.

<doc id="376149" wikidata="Q785321" url="?curid=376149" title="William J. Hardee">
<text>William Joseph Hardee (October 12, 1815November 6, 1873) was a career U.S. Army and Confederate States Army officer. For the U.S. Army, he served in the Second Seminole War and in the Mexican–American War, where he was captured and exchanged. In the American Civil War, he sided with the South and became a general. Hardee served in the Western Theater and quarreled sharply with two of his commanding officers, Braxton Bragg and John Bell Hood. He served in the Atlanta Campaign of 1864 and the Carolinas Campaign of 1865, where he surrendered with General Joseph E. Johnston to William Tecumseh Sherman in April. Hardee&#x27;s writings about military tactics were widely used on both sides in the conflict.

==Early life and career==
Hardee was born to Sarah Ellis and Major John Hais Hardee Jr. at the Rural Felicity Plantation in Camden County, Georgia. One of his brothers was noted Savannah merchant Noble Hardee. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1838 (26th in a class of 45) and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. During the Seminole Wars (1835–42), he was stricken with illness, and while hospitalized he met and married Elizabeth Dummett. After he recovered, the Army sent him to France to study military tactics in 1840. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1839 and to captain in 1844.

In the Mexican–American War, Hardee served in the Army of Occupation under Zachary Taylor and won two brevet promotions (to brevet major for Medelin and Vera Cruz, and to lieutenant colonel for St. Augustin). He served with the 2nd U.S. Dragoons, and was second in command to Seth Thornton, when they were ambushed and surrounded by Mexican troops and subsequently captured on April 25, 1846, at Carricitos Ranch, Texas, during the &quot;Thornton Affair&quot;. He was exchanged on May 11. Now serving under Winfield Scott, Hardee was wounded in a skirmish at La Rosia, Mexico (about above Matamoros) in 1847. After the war, he led units of Texas Rangers and soldiers in Texas.

After his wife died in 1853, he returned to West Point as a tactics instructor and served as commandant of cadets from 1856 to 1860. He served as the senior major in the 2nd U.S. Cavalry (later renumbered as the 5th U.S. Cavalry) when that regiment was formed in 1855 and then as the lieutenant colonel of the 1st U.S. Cavalry in 1860. In 1855 at the behest of Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, Hardee published &quot;Rifle and Light Infantry Tactics for the Exercise and Manoeuvres of Troops When Acting as Light Infantry or Riflemen&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Hardee&#x27;s Tactics&quot;, which became the best-known drill manual of the Civil War. He is also said to have designed the so-called Hardee hat about this time.

==Civil War==
Hardee resigned his U.S. Army commission on January 31, 1861, after his home state of Georgia seceded from the Union. He joined the Confederate States Army as a colonel on March 7 and was given command of Forts Morgan and Gaines in Alabama. He was subsequently promoted to brigadier general (June 17) and major general (October 7). By October 10, 1862, he was one of the first Confederate lieutenant generals.

His initial assignment as a general was to organize a brigade of Arkansas regiments and he impressed his men and fellow officers by solving difficult supply problems and for the thorough training he gave his brigade. He received his nickname, &quot;Old Reliable&quot;, while with this command. Hardee operated in Arkansas until he was called to join General Albert Sidney Johnston&#x27;s Army of Central Kentucky as a corps commander. Johnston would withdraw from Kentucky and Tennessee, into Mississippi, before launching a surprise attack at the Battle of Shiloh in the spring of 1862. Hardee was wounded in the arm on April 6, 1862, during the first day of the battle.

Johnston was killed at Shiloh and Hardee&#x27;s corps joined General Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee prior to the Siege of Corinth, Mississippi, until Department Commander P.G.T. Beauregard evacuated the town and withdrew to Tupelo. Beauregard was replaced by Bragg, who subsequently moved his army to Chattanooga before embarking on his Confederate Heartland Offensive into Kentucky. That campaign concluded with the Battle of Perryville in October 1862, where Hardee commanded the Left Wing of Bragg&#x27;s army.
In arguably his most successful battle, at the Battle of Stones River that December, his Second Corps launched a massive surprise assault upon the right flank of Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans&#x27;s army, driving it almost to defeat, but again, as had happened at Perryville, Bragg failed to follow up his tactical success, opting instead to withdraw before the arrival of Union reinforcements.

After the Tullahoma Campaign, Hardee lost patience with the irascible, retreating Bragg and briefly commanded the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana under General Joseph E. Johnston. During this period, he met Mary Foreman Lewis, an Alabama plantation owner, whom he would later marry in January 1864.

Hardee returned to Bragg&#x27;s army after the Battle of Chickamauga, taking over the corps of Leonidas Polk at Chattanooga, Tennessee, besieging the Union Army there. During the Chattanooga Campaign in November 1863, Hardee&#x27;s Corps of the Army of Tennessee was defeated when Union troops under Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas assaulted their seemingly impregnable defensive lines at the Battle of Missionary Ridge.

Hardee renewed his opposition to serving under Bragg and joined a group of officers who finally convinced Confederate President Jefferson Davis to relieve Bragg. Hardee was given temporary command of the Army of Tennessee before Joseph E. Johnston took over command at Dalton, Georgia. In February 1864, Johnston was ordered by the President to dispatch Hardee to Alabama, to reinforce General Polk against General Sherman&#x27;s Meridian Campaign.

Following Sherman&#x27;s withdrawal to Vicksburg, Hardee was once again sent back to Georgia, where he joined Johnston&#x27;s army for the Atlanta Campaign. As Johnston fought a war of maneuver and retreat against Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, the Confederacy eventually lost patience with him and replaced him with the much more aggressive Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. Hardee could not abide Hood&#x27;s reckless assaults and heavy casualties. After the Battle of Jonesboro that August and September, he requested a transfer and was sent to command the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. He opposed Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea as best he could with inadequate forces, eventually evacuating Savannah, Georgia on December 20.

As Sherman turned north in the Carolinas Campaign, Hardee took part in the Battle of Bentonville, North Carolina, in March 1865, where his only son, 16-year-old Willie, was mortally wounded in a cavalry charge. Johnston&#x27;s plan for Bentonville was for Hardee to engage one of Sherman&#x27;s wings at Averasborough so that Johnston could deal with one wing piecemeal. The plan was unsuccessful. He surrendered along with Johnston to Sherman on April 26 at Durham Station.

==Postbellum life==
After the war, Hardee settled at his wife&#x27;s Alabama plantation. After returning it to working condition, the family moved to Selma, Alabama, where Hardee worked in the warehousing and insurance businesses. He eventually became president of the Selma and Meridian Railroad. Hardee was the co-author of &quot;The Irish in America&quot;, published in 1868. He fell ill at his family&#x27;s summer retreat at White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, and died in Wytheville, Virginia on November 6, 1873. He is buried in Live Oak Cemetery, Selma, Alabama.

<doc id="376160" wikidata="Q77122" url="?curid=376160" title="Karl Drais">
<text>Karl Freiherr von Drais (full name: Karl Friedrich Christian Ludwig Freiherr Drais von Sauerbronn; 29 April 1785 – 10 December 1851) was a noble German forest official and significant inventor in the Biedermeier period. He was born and died in Karlsruhe. He is seen as &quot;the father of the bicycle&quot;.

==Bicycle==
Drais was a prolific inventor, who invented the Laufmaschine (&quot;running machine&quot;), also later called the velocipede, &quot;draisine&quot; (English) or &quot;draisienne&quot; (French), also nicknamed the hobby horse or dandy horse. This was his most popular and widely recognized invention. It incorporated the two-wheeler principle that is basic to the bicycle and motorcycle and was the beginning of mechanized personal transport. This was the earliest form of a bicycle, without pedals. 

His first reported ride from Mannheim to the &quot;Schwetzinger Relaishaus&quot; (a coaching inn, located in &quot;Rheinau&quot;, today a district of Mannheim) took place on 12 June 1817 using Baden&#x27;s best road. Karl rode his bike; it was a distance of about . The round trip took him a little more than an hour but may be seen as the big bang for horseless transport. However, after marketing the velocipede, it became apparent that roads were so rutted by carriages that it was hard to balance on the machine for long, so velocipede riders took to the pavements (sidewalks) and moved far too quickly, endangering pedestrians. Consequently, authorities in Germany, Great Britain, the United States, and even Calcutta banned its use, which ended its vogue for decades.

== Other inventions ==
Drais also invented the earliest typewriter with a keyboard (1821). He later developed an early stenograph machine which used 16 characters (1827), a device to record piano music on paper (1812), the first meat grinder (1840s), and a wood-saving cooker including the earliest hay chest. He also invented two four-wheeled human powered vehicles (1813/1814), the second of which he presented in Vienna to the congress carving up Europe after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat. In 1842, he developed a foot-driven human powered railway vehicle whose name &quot;draisine&quot; is used even today for railway handcars.

== Time as civil servant ==
Drais was unable to market his inventions for profit because he was still a civil servant of Baden, even though he was being paid without providing active service. As a result, on 12 January 1818, Drais was awarded a grand-ducal privilege (&quot;Großherzogliches Privileg&quot;) to protect his inventions for 10 years in Baden by the younger Grand Duke Karl. Grand Duke Karl also appointed Drais professor of mechanics. This was merely an honorary title, not related to any university or other institution. Drais retired from the civil service and was awarded a pension for his appointment to professor of mechanical science.

==Upheaval==
In 1820, trouble overtook Drais when the political murder of the author August von Kotzebue was followed by the beheading of the perpetrator, Karl Ludwig Sand. In 1822, Drais was a fervent liberal who supported revolution in Baden. Drais&#x27;s conservative father, as the highest Judge of Baden, had not entered a plea for pardon in the beheading of Karl Ludwig Sand, and the younger Drais was mobbed by the student partisans everywhere in Germany due to his family ties. Therefore, Drais emigrated to Brazil where he lived from 1822 to 1827, and worked as a land surveyor on the fazenda of Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff. In 1827, he returned to Mannheim. Three years later in 1830, Drais&#x27;s father died and the younger Drais was mobbed by jealous rivals.

In 1839, after surviving a murderous attack in 1838, he moved to the village of Waldkatzenbach in the hills of Odenwald and remained there until 1845. During this period, he invented the railway handcar (later known as the draisine). Finally, he moved back to his place of birth, Karlsruhe. In 1849, and still a fervent radical, Drais gave up his title of Baron and dropped the &quot;von&quot; from his name. Subsequently, after the revolution collapsed, he was in a very bad position. The royalists tried to have him certified as mad and locked up. His pension was confiscated to help to pay for the &quot;costs of revolution&quot; after it was suppressed by the Prussians.

==Death==

Drais&#x27;s undoing had been the fact that he had publicly renounced his noble title in 1848, and adopted the name &quot;Citizen Karl Drais&quot; as a tribute to the French Revolution.

Karl Drais died penniless on 10 December 1851 in Karlsruhe. The house in which he lived last is just two blocks away from where at that time a young Carl Benz was raised.

==Tributes==

In 1985, West Germany issued a commemorative postage stamp, a semipostal 50 Pf+25 Pf surcharge, in remembrance of the 200th anniversary of Karl Drais&#x27;s birthday.

In 2017, Germany issued a commemorative postage stamp (0.70 Euro) in remembrance of the 200th anniversary of Karl Drais&#x27;s first run of his &quot;running machine&quot; on 12 June 1817. The stamp shows the machine plus as its shadow, a bicycle.

<doc id="376161" wikidata="Q3736324" url="?curid=376161" title="Cato's Letters">
<text>Cato&#x27;s Letters were essays by British writers John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, first published from 1720 to 1723 under the pseudonym of Cato (95–46 BC), the implacable foe of Julius Caesar and a famously stalwart champion of Roman traditionalism (&quot;mos maiorum&quot;).

== Purpose ==

The &quot;Letters&quot; are considered a seminal work in the tradition of the Commonwealth men. 

They condemned corruption and lack of morality within the British political system and warned against tyrannical rule and abuse of power. For instance &quot;all History affords but few Instances of Men trusted with great Power without abusing it, when with Security they could.”

== Publication ==
The 144 essays were published originally beginning in 1720 within the &quot;London Journal&quot;, later in the &quot;British Journal&quot;. The &quot;Letters&quot; were collected and printed as &quot;Essays on Liberty, Civil and Religious&quot;. A measure of their influence is attested by six editions printed by 1755. 

== Influence ==
A generation later their arguments immensely influenced the ideals of the American Revolution. According to Peter Karsten&#x27;s &quot;Patriot-Heroes in England and America&quot;, &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot; were the most common holdings on the bookcases of the founding fathers.

These letters also provided inspiration and ideals for the American Revolutionary generation. The essays were distributed widely across the Thirteen Colonies, and frequently quoted in newspapers from Boston to Savannah, Georgia. Renowned historian Clinton Rossiter stated &quot;no one can spend any time on the newspapers, library inventories, and pamphlets of colonial America without realizing that Cato&#x27;s Letters rather than John Locke&#x27;s Civil Government was the most popular, quotable, esteemed source for political ideas in the colonial period.&quot;

The Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank founded by Edward H. Crane in 1977, takes its name from &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot;.

== Other pseudonymous &quot;Cato letters&quot; ==

Unrelated to the Trenchard and Gordon letters, two different letter-writers in eighteenth-century America also used Cato as a pseudonym in writing political letters for publication.

One &quot;Cato&quot; wrote a series of essays arguing against American independence in the Pennsylvania Gazette, which were published in April 1776. According to Thomas Paine biographer Moncure D. Conway, this &quot;Cato&quot; was Reverend Dr. William Smith, an influential Anglican minister in Philadelphia. His views were opposed in letters signed by &quot;The Forester,&quot; apparently Paine.

Cato was later used as a pseudonym in a series of letters to the &quot;New York Journal&quot; in 1787 and 1788 opposing James Madison&#x27;s views and urging against ratification of the United States Constitution (the view known as Anti-Federalism). Many historians attribute these letters to George Clinton, though their authorship has not been definitively proven. Alexander Hamilton published responses to these letters under the pseudonym &quot;Caesar.&quot;

<doc id="376168" wikidata="Q643299" url="?curid=376168" title="Love and Rockets (band)">
<text>Love and Rockets are an English rock band formed in 1985 by former Bauhaus members Daniel Ash (vocals, guitar and saxophone), David J (bass guitar and vocals) and Kevin Haskins (drums and synthesisers) after that group split in 1983. Ash and Haskins had recorded and performed in another band, Tones on Tail, between 1982 and 1984. 

Love and Rockets&#x27; fusion of underground rock music with elements of pop music provided an early catalyst for alternative rock. Their 1989 single &quot;So Alive&quot; reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. They released seven studio albums before breaking up in 1999 and reformed briefly in 2007 for a few live shows, before splitting again in 2009. They reformed in 2023, and announced several tour dates.

== History ==

The band&#x27;s name was taken from the comic book series &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; by the Hernandez brothers. Gilbert Hernandez later referred to the confusion caused by this in his book &quot;Love and Rockets X&quot;, as there were several different bands named &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; for a period.

Despite their previous band&#x27;s status as a gothic rock act, Love and Rockets moved towards a slightly brighter and more pop-influenced sound, as demonstrated by their first minor hit being a cover of the Motown classic &quot;Ball of Confusion&quot; (reached #18 on the Canadian charts in January 1986). Their first studio album was 1985&#x27;s &quot;Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven&quot; (1985). Their second album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Express&quot;, continued in the same vein, adding even more of a pop feel to the mix. It included the dance hit &quot;Yin and Yang (The Flowerpot Man)&quot;. The 1987 follow-up, &quot;Earth, Sun, Moon&quot;, had a more acoustic sound and spawned the minor hit &quot;No New Tale to Tell&quot;. The following year, they released the single &quot;The Bubblemen Are Coming&quot; under the alias The Bubblemen. A music video was also produced. It was issued by Beggars Banquet Records in several format variations, including additional tracks &quot;Bubblemen Rap&quot;, &quot;Bubblemen Rap (Dub Version)&quot; and &quot;Bees&quot;. A brief excerpt of &quot;The Bubblemen are Coming!&quot; appeared in the Love and Rockets videos &quot;No New Tale to Tell&quot; and &quot;Yin and Yang (The Flowerpot Man)&quot;.

In 1989 the band released their self-titled album, which presented a more AOR sound. The second single from the album was the T. Rex-inspired song &quot;So Alive&quot;, which became a hit, reaching No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, a feat no Bauhaus-related band or artist has achieved before or since.

After a gruelling tour schedule in support of their big hit, Love and Rockets took a few years off before returning to the studio together. The result was a move to an electronic sound that had more in common with the Orb than their rock or goth roots. Their label, RCA Records, dropped them. They signed with Rick Rubin&#x27;s American Recordings to release &quot;Hot Trip to Heaven&quot; in 1994, followed in 1996 by &quot;Sweet F.A.&quot;. In April 1995, during the recording of &quot;Sweet F.A.&quot;, a fire broke out in the house owned by American Recordings, where the band were living and recording. None of the members were injured, but their visiting friend Genesis P. Orridge of Psychic TV was injured whilst escaping the fire. The band lost their gear (a photo of a burnt guitar was used for the album cover of &quot;Sweet F.A.&quot;) and months of work on the album. There was a lengthy legal battle between the band, their label, and the label&#x27;s insurance company. Love and Rockets were found not responsible for the fire, but were left with a large legal bill. &quot;Lift&quot; came out in 1998 on Red Ant Records, and, after performing in Toronto in April, 1999, Love and Rockets disbanded.

Love and Rockets announced in October 2007 on their MySpace page that they would reform to play one song at &quot;Cast a Long Shadow&quot;, a tribute to Joe Strummer and benefit for Strummerville, the Joe Strummer Foundation for New Music, on 22 December 2007 at the Key Club in West Hollywood, California. They covered the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot;, playing the song twice, the second time inviting members of the audience to join them onstage to sing along. They performed on 27 April 2008 at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and also at Lollapalooza on 3 August 2008 in Chicago.

In an interview in June 2009, Ash emphatically stated that he had no further plans to play with Love and Rockets. &quot;We&#x27;ve worked together since 1980. I really want to work with new people, I&#x27;m sure everybody feels the same.&quot;

A tribute album titled &quot;New Tales to Tell: A Tribute to Love and Rockets&quot; was released on 18 August 2009 featuring contributions from the Flaming Lips, Frank Black, Puscifer, A Place to Bury Strangers, Film School, Better Than Ezra, Johnny Dowd, the Dandy Warhols, Blaqk Audio, the Stone Foxes and Monster Magnet.

On 23 January 2023, Love and Rockets announced a reunion for an appearance at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California on 20 May 2023, the band&#x27;s first concert in 15 years. They later announced a 2023 U.S. tour in support of their appearance at Cruel World. A Bauhaus reunion was aborted in 2022 after Peter Murphy forced the band to cancel the tour as he entered rehab. Ash said that the 2023 tour would be the band&#x27;s final.

In May 2024, it was announced Love and Rockets would be touring with Jane&#x27;s Addiction, however this tour was cancelled part way through.

<text>The Rotary Lombardi Award is an award for college football in the United States. Awarded by the Rotary Club of Houston, Texas annually to the college football player &quot;who best embodies the values and spirit of NFL&#x27;s legendary coach Vince Lombardi&quot; the Rotary Lombardi Award program was created in 1970 shortly after the death of Lombardi. The committee outlined the original criteria for eligibility for the award, which remained in place until this day:

== History ==
Following the death of highly regarded football coach Vince Lombardi in 1970 his widow, Marie, authorised the Rotary Club of Houston to establish the Rotary Lombardi Award. The award began as recognition to only interior line positions that Vince Lombardi played while an undergraduate at Fordham University, offensive and defensive guard, and later expanded to include linebackers and tight ends, with the addition of including non-performance values: leadership, courage, desire, respect for authority, and discipline.

To be considered for the award, players must be an NCAA FBS College Football team member and meet the following qualifications:

* Be a down Lineman, end to end, either on offense or defense, setting up no further than ten (10) yards to the left or right of the ball at the time of the snap.
* Be a Linebacker on defense, setting up no further than five (5) yards deep from the line of scrimmage. 
* Must not come out of the offensive backfield and set up on the line of scrimmage as a Blocker or a Receiver or listed in the program as an Offensive Back or Receiver.
* Be eligible to participate in the current season.

The voting electorate is made up of the head coaches from all NCAA Division I schools, sports media personnel from across the country, and former winners and finalists of the Lombardi Award. The total number of voters is approximately 500. The Ohio State University holds the record for most Lombardi awards with six. Orlando Pace, the only two-time winner (1995 and 1996), is the most recent offensive lineman to be honored.

Net proceeds from the award activities are contributed to cancer research, awareness, and treatment, on the stipulation of Marie Lombardi.

=== Expansion of candidates, then retraction ===
In 2017, the presenting Rotary Club expanded the award&#x27;s eligibility to include all positions. This lasted until 2021, when they reverted to the original criteria. The winners from 2017 through 2020 are not recognized by the current award committee, although 2020 winner Zaven Collins qualified under the original criteria.
=== Trophy ===
The main part of the trophy is a block of granite, paying homage to Lombardi&#x27;s college days at Fordham University as an offensive lineman when his offensive line was referred to as the &quot;Seven Blocks of Granite&quot;.

<doc id="376171" wikidata="Q1144579" url="?curid=376171" title="Doukhobors">
<text>The Doukhobors (Canadian spelling) or Dukhobors (; ) are a Spiritual Christian ethnoreligious group of Russian origin. They are known for their pacifism and tradition of oral history, hymn-singing, and verse. They reject the Russian Orthodox priesthood and associated rituals, believing that personal revelation is more important than the Bible. Facing persecution by the Russian government for their nonorthodox beliefs, many migrated to Canada between 1899 and 1938, where most of them reside .

In Russia, &quot;Dukhobortsy&quot; were variously portrayed as &quot;folk-Protestants&quot;, Spiritual Christians, sectarians, and heretics. Among their core beliefs is the rejection of materialism. They also reject the Russian Orthodox priesthood, the use of icons, and all associated church rituals. Doukhobors believe the Bible alone is not enough to reach divine revelation and that doctrinal conflicts can interfere with their faith. Biblical teachings are evident in some published Doukhobor psalms, hymns, and beliefs. Since arriving in Canada, parts of the Old Testament, but more profoundly the New Testament, were at the core of most Doukhobor beliefs. There continue to be spiritually progressive thinkers who, through introspection and debate, search for divine revelation to improve the faith.

The Doukhobors have a history dating back to at least 1701 (though some scholars suspect the group has earlier origins). Doukhobors traditionally lived in their own villages and practiced communal living. The name &quot;Doukhobors&quot;, meaning &quot;Spirit-wrestlers&quot;, derives from a slur made by the Russian Orthodox Church that was subsequently embraced by the group. 

Before 1886, the Doukhobors had a series of leaders. The origin of the Doukhobors is uncertain; they first appear in first written records from 1701. 

The Doukhobors traditionally ate bread and &quot;borsch&quot;. Some of their food-related religious symbols are bread, salt, and water.

== History ==
In the 17th-and-18th-century Russian Empire, the first recorded Doukhobors concluded clergy and formal rituals are unnecessary, believing in God&#x27;s presence in every human being. They rejected the secular government, the Russian Orthodox priests, icons, all church rituals, and the belief the Bible is a supreme source of divine revelation. The Doukhobors believed in the divinity of Jesus; their practices, emphasis on individual interpretation, and opposition to the government and church provoked antagonism from the government and the established Russian Eastern Orthodox Church. In 1734, the Russian government issued an edict against &quot;ikonobortsy&quot; (those who reject icons), condemning them as iconoclasts.

The first-known Doukhobor leader was Siluan (Silvan) Kolesnikov (), who was active from 1755 to 1775. Kolesnikov lived in the village Nikolskoye, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, in modern-day south-central Ukraine. Kolesnikov was familiar with the works of Western mystics such as Karl von Eckartshausen and Louis Claude de Saint-Martin.

The early Doukhobors called themselves &quot;God&#x27;s People&quot; or &quot;Christians.&quot; Their modern name, first in the form &quot;Doukhobortsy&quot; (, &quot;dukhobortsy&quot; (&quot;Spirit wrestlers&quot;)) is thought to have been first used in 1785 or 1786 by Ambrosius the Archbishop of Yekaterinoslav or his predecessor Nikifor (Nikephoros Theotokis). The archbishop&#x27;s intent was to mock the Doukhobors as heretics fighting against the Holy Spirit (, &quot;Svyatoy Dukh&quot;) but around the beginning of the 19th century, according to SA Inikova, the dissenters adopted the name &quot;Doukhobors&quot; usually in a shorter form &quot;Doukhobory&quot; (, &quot;dukhobory&quot;), implying they are fighting alongside rather than against the Holy Spirit. The first known use of the spelling &quot;Doukhobor&quot; is in a 1799 government edict exiling 90 of the group to Finland; presumably the Vyborg area, which was part of the Russian Empire at the time, for producing anti-war propaganda.

The early Doukhobors were pacifists who rejected military institutions and war and were thus oppressed in Imperial Russia. Both the tsarist state and church authorities were involved in the persecution and deprivation of the dissidents&#x27; normal freedoms.

In 1802, Tsar Alexander I encouraged the resettlement of religious minorities to the &quot;Milky Waters&quot; (&quot;Molochnye Vody&quot;) region around the Molochnaya River around Melitopol in modern-day southern Ukraine. This was motivated by the desire to quickly populate the rich steppe lands on the north shore of the Black and Azov Seas, and to prevent the &quot;heretics&quot; from contaminating the population of the heartland with their ideas. Many Doukhobors, as well as Mennonites from Prussia, accepted the Emperor&#x27;s offer and travelled to the Molochnaya from other provinces of the Empire over the next 20 years.

=== Transcaucasian exile ===

When Nicholas I succeeded Alexander as Tsar, on February 6, 1826, he issued a decree intending to force the assimilation of the Doukhobors through military conscription, prohibiting their meetings, and encouraging conversions to the established church. On October 20, 1830, another decree followed, specifying all able-bodied members of dissenting religious groups engaged in propaganda against the established church should be conscripted and sent to the Russian army in the Caucasus while those not capable of military service, and their women and children, should be resettled in Russia&#x27;s recently acquired Transcaucasian provinces. With other dissenters, around 5,000 Doukhobors were resettled in Georgia between 1841 and 1845. Akhalkalaki &quot;uyezd&quot; (district) in the Tiflis Governorate was chosen as the main place of their settlement. Doukhobor villages with Russian names appeared there; Gorelovka, Rodionovka, Yefremovka, Orlovka, Spasskoye (Dubovka), Troitskoye, and Bogdanovka. Later, other groups of Doukhobors were resettled by the government or migrated to Transcaucasia of their own accord. They also settled in neighbouring areas, including the Borchaly uyezd of Tiflis Governorate and the Kedabek uyezd of Elisabethpol Governorate.

In 1844, Doukhobors who were being exiled from their home near Melitopol to the village of Bogdanovka carved the Doukhobor Memorial Stone, which is held in the collection of the Melitopol Museum of Local History.

After Russia&#x27;s conquest of Kars and the Treaty of San Stefano of 1878, some Doukhobors from Tiflis and Elisabethpol Governorates moved to the Zarushat and Shuragel uyezds of the newly created Kars Oblast to the north-east of Kars in the modern-day Republic of Turkey. The leader of the main group of Doukhobors, who arrived in Transcaucasia from Ukraine in 1841, was Illarion Kalmykov (). He died in the same year and was succeeded as the community leader by his son Peter Kalmykov (?–1864). After Peter Kalmykov&#x27;s death in 1864, his widow Lukerya Vasilyevna Gubanova (? – December 15, 1886; (); also known as Kalmykova) took his leadership position.

The Kalmykov dynasty lived in the village of Gorelovka, a Doukhobor community in Georgia. Lukerya was respected by the provincial authorities, who had to cooperate with the Doukhobors. At the time of her death in 1886, there were around 20,000 Doukhobors in Transcaucasia. By that time, the region&#x27;s Doukhobors had become vegetarian and were aware of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s philosophy, which they found quite similar to their own traditional teachings.

=== Religious revival and crises ===
The death of Lukerya, who had no children, was followed by a leadership crisis that divided the Dukhobortsy in the Caucasus into two major groups, which disputed their next leader. Lukerya wanted leadership to pass to her assistant Peter Vasilevich Verigin. Although most of the community—&quot;the Large Party&quot; —accepted him as the leader, a minority faction known as &quot;the Small Party&quot; (Малая сторона &quot;Malaya Storona&quot;) rejected Verigin, and sided with Lukerya&#x27;s brother Michael Gubanov and the village elder Aleksei Zubkov.

While the Large Party was a majority, the Small Party had the support of the older members of the community and the local authorities. On January 26, 1887, at a community service at which the new leader was to be acclaimed, police arrived and arrested Verigin. He, along with some of his associates, was sent into internal exile in Siberia. Large Party Doukhobors continued to consider Verigin their spiritual leader and to communicate with him, by mail and via delegates who travelled to see him in Obdorsk. An isolated population of exiled Doukhobors, a third &quot;party&quot;, was about east in Amur Oblast.

At the same time, the Russian government applied greater pressure to enforce the Doukhobors&#x27; compliance with its laws and regulations. The Doukhobors had resisted registering marriages and births, contributing grain to state emergency funds, and swearing oaths of allegiance. In 1887, Russia extended universal military conscription, which applied to the rest of the empire, to the Transcaucasian provinces. While the Small Party cooperated with the state, the Large Party, reacting to the arrest of their leaders and inspired by their letters from exile, felt strengthened in their desire to abide by the righteousness of their faith. Under instructions from Verigin, the Large Party stopped using tobacco and alcohol, divided their property equally among the members of the community, and resolved to adhere to the practice of pacifism and non-violence. They refused to swear the oath of allegiance required in 1894 by the newly ascended Tsar Nicholas II.

Under further instructions from Verigin, about 7,000 of the most zealous Doukhobors—about one-third of all Doukhobors—of the three Governorates of Transcaucasia destroyed their weapons and refused to serve in the military. As the Doukhobors gathered to burn their guns on the night of June 28/29 (July 10/11, Gregorian calendar) 1895, while singing psalms and spiritual songs, government Cossacks arrested and beat them. Shortly after, the government billeted Cossacks in many of the Large Party&#x27;s villages; around 4,000 Doukhobors were forced to disperse to villages in other parts of Georgia. Many died of starvation and exposure.

=== Migration to Canada ===
=== First emigrants ===
The resistance of the Doukhobors gained international attention and the Russian Empire was criticized for its treatment of this religious minority. In 1897, the Russian government agreed to let the Doukhobors leave the country, subject to conditions:
* emigrants should never return;
* emigrants must emigrate at their own expense;
* community leaders in prison or exile in Siberia must serve the balance of their sentences before they could leave Russia.

Emigrants initially attempted to settle in Cyprus. Cyprus was, at the time, recognized as a possession of the Ottoman Empire, but in the wake of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), the Ottoman Empire had granted the United Kingdom the right to administer the island in exchange for support in its continuing conflict with the Russian Empire. This fact made the potential settlement of the Russian Doukhobors a politically-sensitive question among some in the British government, but after Quaker supporters both made assurances of the Doukhobors&#x27; political inoffensiveness and provided financial guarantees against their potential indigency, officials permitted over 1,000 Doukhobors to establish farming settlements in several locations on the island beginning in the second half of 1898. However, the Cyprus experiment soon proved to be disastrous: beset by disease (made worse by insufficient food that met the Doukhobors&#x27; religious requirements) as well as internal disagreements over community organization, nearly ten percent of the colony died by early 1899.

Canada offered more land, transportation, and aid to resettle in the Saskatchewan area. Around 6,000 Doukhobors emigrated there in the first half of 1899, settling on land granted to them by the government in modern-day Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. The Cyprus colony and others joined them, and around 7,500 Russian Doukhobor emigrants—about a third of their number in Russia—arrived in Canada by the end of the year. Several smaller groups joined the main body of emigrants in later years, coming directly from Transcaucasia and other places of exile. Among these latecomers were 110 leaders of the community who had to complete their sentences before being allowed to emigrate. By 1930, about 8,780 Doukhobors had migrated from Russia to Canada.

The Quakers and Tolstoyan movement covered most of the costs of passage for the emigrants; writer Leo Tolstoy arranged for the royalties from his novel &quot;Resurrection&quot;, his story &quot;Father Sergei&quot;, and some others to go to the emigration fund. Tolstoy also raised money from wealthy friends; his efforts provided about 30,000 rubles, half of the emigration fund. The anarchist Peter Kropotkin and professor of political economy at the University of Toronto James Mavor also helped the emigrants.

The emigrants adapted to life in agricultural communes; they were mostly of peasant origin and had low regard for advanced education. Many worked as loggers, lumbermen, and carpenters. Eventually, many left the communal dormitories and became private farmers on the Canadian plains. Religious &quot;a cappella&quot; singing, pacifism, and passive resistance were markers of the sect. One subgroup occasionally demonstrated naked, typically as a protest against compulsory military service. Their policies made them controversial. The modern descendants of the first wave of Doukhobor emigrants continue to live in southeastern British Columbia communities such as Krestova, and in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. , the estimated population of Doukhobor descent in North America was 40,000 in Canada and about 5,000 in the United States.

=== Canadian prairies ===
In accordance with the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; of 1872, for a nominal fee of , the Canadian government would grant of land to any male homesteader who was able to establish a working farm on that land within three years. Single-family homesteads would not fit the Doukhobors&#x27; communitarian tradition but a &quot;Hamlet Clause&quot; within the Act had been adopted 15 years earlier to accommodate other communitarian groups such as Mennonites. The clause allowed beneficiaries of the Act to live in a hamlet within from their land rather than on the land itself. This allowed the Doukhobors to establish a communal lifestyle similar to that of the Hutterites. Also, by passing Section 21 of the &quot;Dominion Military Act&quot; in late 1898, the Canadian Government exempted the Doukhobors from military service.

The land for the Doukhobor immigrants, in total within what was to soon become the Province of Saskatchewan, came in three block settlement areas or &quot;reserves&quot;, and an annex:
* The North Colony, also known as the &quot;Thunder Hill Colony&quot; or &quot;Swan River Colony&quot; in the Pelly and Arran districts of Saskatchewan became home to 2,400 Doukhobors from Tiflis Governorate, who established 20 villages on of the land grant.
* The South Colony, also known as the &quot;Whitesand Colony&quot; or &quot;Yorkton Colony&quot; in the Canora, Veregin and Kamsack districts of Saskatchewan. 3,500 Doukhobors from Tiflis Governorate, Elisabethpol Governorate, and Kars Oblast settled there in 30 villages on of land grant.
* The Good Spirit Lake Annex in the Buchanan district of Saskatchewan received 1,000 Doukhobors from Elisabethpol Governorate and Kars Oblast, Russia, and settled there in eight villages on of land grant. The annex was along the Good Spirit River, which flows into Good Spirit Lake (previously known as Devil&#x27;s Lake).
* The Saskatchewan Colony, also known as the &quot;Rosthern Colony&quot;, &quot;Prince Albert Colony&quot; and &quot;Duck Lake Colony&quot; was located along North Saskatchewan River in the Langham and Blaine Lake districts of Saskatchewan, north-west of Saskatoon. 1,500 Doukhobors from Kars Oblast settled there in 13 villages on of land grant.

North and South Colonies, and Good Spirit Lake Annex, were located around Yorkton near the modern-day border with Manitoba; the Saskatchewan (Rosthern) Colony was located north-west of Saskatoon, a significant distance from the other three reserves.

In 1899, all four reserves formed part of the Northwest Territories: Saskatchewan (Rosthern) Colony in the territories&#x27; provisional District of Saskatchewan. North Reserve straddled the boundary of Saskatchewan and Assiniboia districts, and the other reserves were entirely in Assiniboia. After the establishment of the Province of Saskatchewan in 1905, all reserves were located within that province.

Verigin persuaded his followers to free their animals, and pull their wagons and plows themselves. On the lands granted to them in the prairies, the settlers established Russian-style villages, some of which received Russian names after settlers&#x27; home villages in Transcaucasia; for example Spasovka, Large and Small Gorelovka, and Slavianka; while others gained more abstract &quot;spiritual&quot; names not common in Russia, such as Uspeniye (Dormition), Terpeniye (Patience), Bogomdannoye (Given by God), and Osvobozhdeniye (Liberation). The settlers found Saskatchewan winters much harsher than those in Transcaucasia, and expressed disappointment the climate was not as suitable for growing fruits and vegetables. Women greatly outnumbered the men; many women worked on the farms tilling the land while many men took non-farm jobs, especially in railway construction. The earliest arrivals came from three backgrounds, had varying commitments to communal life, and lacked leadership. Verigin arrived in December 1902, was recognized as the leader, and reimposed communalism and self-sufficiency. The railway arrived in 1904 and hopes of isolation from Canadian society ended.

==== Popular distrust ====
Canadians, politicians, and the media were deeply suspicious of the Doukhobors. Their communal lifestyle seemed suspicious, their refusal to send children to school was considered deeply troubling, while pacifism caused anger during the First World War. The oppression of the Russian Tsarist regime had entrenched its resulting pacifist beliefs into the Doukhobour tenets and they did not waver with the onset of either World War. Some Canadians who were willing to go to war did not respect a sect of people that were excused from military service. This difference in perspective produced much political prejudice towards the Doukhobours. Tumultuous political posturing and years of polarized social disagreements eventually brought some Doukhobours to the point of protests aimed at maintaining their simple, non-materialistic, and autonomous communal living. The Doukhobor faction known as Sons of Freedom conducted nude marches and carried out night-time arson attacks, which was considered unacceptable and offensive. Canadian magazines showed strong curiosity, giving special attention to women&#x27;s bodies and clothing. Magazines and newspapers carried stories and photographs of Doukhobor women engaging in hard farm labour, doing &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot;, wearing the traditional ethnic dress, and in partial or total states of undress. Doukhobors received financial help from Quakers. Clifford Sifton, the Minister of the Interior, wanted the Doukhobors in Canada; he arranged financial subsidies to allow them to migrate.

==== Loss of land rights ====

Due to the community&#x27;s aversion to private ownership of land, Verigin had the land registered in the name of the community. By 1906, the Canadian Government&#x27;s new Minister of the Interior Frank Oliver started requiring the registration of land in the name of individual owners. Many Doukhobors refused to comply, resulting in 1907 in the reverting of more than a third () of Doukhobor lands back to the Crown. The loss of legal title to their land became a major grievance.

=== Schism ===
Ten years after the Russian conscription crisis, another political issue arose because the Doukhobors would have to become naturalized British citizens and swear an Oath of Allegiance to the British Crown—something that had always been against their principles. They did not know that they could have submitted an &quot;affirmation&quot; instead of an &quot;oath&quot;.

The &quot;oath&quot; issue resulted in a three-way split of the Doukhobor immigrants in Canada: 

* Community Doukhobors — Also communal Doukhobors, or orthodox Doukhobors. The largest group originally led by Peter V. Verigin (1859-1924) who formed the Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood (CCUB). His successor son Peter P. Verigin (1881-1939) in 1938 rebranded as the Union of Spiritual Communities of Christ (USCC), headquartered in Grand Forks, British Columbia, publishing a monthly journal &quot;Iskra&quot; since 1943. In 1939, John J. Verigin (1921-2008), grandson of P.V. Verigin, was appointed to lead, but changed his title to &quot;Honorary Chairman.&quot; In 2008, his son John J. Verigin, Jr. continued the post.

* Independent Doukhobors — (Russian: единоличники / &quot;edinolichniki&quot;, individual farmers). In 1907 they comprised 10% of the Canadian Doukhobors, maintained their traditions and values, but abandoned communal ownership of land. Most acquired land by affirmation, some by oath. They also rejected hereditary leadership and communal living as non-essential, therefore have many independent local societies and meeting halls, most in Saskatchewan, and some in Alberta and British Columbia. 

* Sons of Freedom — (Originally &quot;svobodniki&quot;, (free, sovereign people) in 1902 tried to return to Russia, refused to obey laws, and attacked law-abiding Doukhobors. They became the famous dissident &quot;Sons of Freedom&quot;, also called &quot;Freedomites&quot; by the media. They misinterpreted P. V. Verigin&#x27;s writings in such a zealous manner that he banned them. The media and government mistakenly confused them with all Canadian Doukhobors when reporting their sensational protests.

Of these groupings, the Independents integrated the most readily into Canadian capitalist society. They had no problem registering their land groups and largely remained in Saskatchewan. In 1939, they definitely rejected the authority of Peter Verigin&#x27;s great-grandson John J. Verigin, Sr.

=== British Columbia and Verigin&#x27;s assassination ===
In 1908, to remove his followers from the corrupting influence of non-Doukhobors and &quot;edinolichniki&quot; (individual owners) Doukhobors, and to find better conditions for agriculture, Verigin bought large tracts of land in south-eastern British Columbia. His first purchase was around Grand Forks near the US border. He later acquired large tracts of land further east in the Slocan Valley around Castlegar. Between 1908 and 1912, about 8,000 people moved from Saskatchewan to these British Columbia lands to continue their communal way of living. In the milder climate of British Columbia, the settlers were able to plant fruit trees and within a few years became renowned orchardists and producers of fruit preserves. As the Community Doukhobors left Saskatchewan, the reserves there were closed by 1918.

On October 29, 1924, Peter V. Verigin was killed in a bomb explosion on a scheduled passenger train &quot;en route&quot; to British Columbia. The government had initially stated the bombing was perpetrated by people within the Doukhobor community, although no arrests were made because of the Doukhobors&#x27; customary refusal to cooperate with Canadian authorities due to fear of intersect violence. It is still unknown who was responsible for the bombing. While the Doukhobors were initially welcomed by the Canadian government, this assassination, as well as Doukhobors&#x27; beliefs regarding communal living, their intolerance for schooling, and other beliefs considered offensive or unacceptable, created a decades-long mistrust between government authorities and Doukhobors.

Peter V. Verigin&#x27;s son Peter P. Verigin, who arrived from the Soviet Union in 1928, succeeded his father as leader of the Community Doukhobors. He became known as &quot;Peter the Purger&quot; (&quot;Chistiakov&quot;) and worked to smooth relations between the Community Doukhobors and wider Canadian society. The governments in Ottawa and the western provinces concluded he was the closet leader of the Sons of Freedom and was perhaps a dangerous Bolshevik. The governments decided to deport him, use the justice system to impose conformity to Canadian values on the Doukhobors, and force them to abide by Canadian law and repudiate unacceptable practices. With a legal defence managed by Peter Makaroff, the deportation effort failed in 1933. The Sons of Freedom repudiated Verigin&#x27;s policies as ungodly and assimilationist, and escalated their protests. The Sons of Freedom burnt Community Doukhobors&#x27; property and organized more nude parades. In 1932, the Parliament of Canada responded by criminalizing public nudity. Over 300 radical Doukhobor men and women were arrested for this offence, which typically carried a three-year prison sentence.

Doukhobors could not vote in British Columbia until 1952. They were the last ethnic or religious community to be granted suffrage in the province.

=== Nudism and arson ===
The Sons of Freedom, a break away protest sect identifying as &quot;svodoniki&quot; (sovereign, free people) in 1902, used nudism and arson as visible methods of protest. They protested against materialism, the land seizure by the government, compulsory education in government schools, and Verigin&#x27;s assassination in 1924. This led to many confrontations with the Canadian government and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which continued into the 1970s. Nudism was first used after the Doukhobors&#x27; arrival in Canada. They used violence to fight modernity, and destroyed threshing machines and other signs of modernity. The group conducted night-time arson attacks on schools built by the Doukhobor commune and Verigin&#x27;s house. The highly publicized acts by the Sons of Freedom were repeatedly mislabeled with the word &quot;Doukhobor&quot;, confusing the different groups and anguishing many law biding assimilated descendants of Canadian Doukhobors.

During 1947 and 1948, Sullivan&#x27;s Royal Commission investigated acts of arson and bombing attacks in British Columbia and recommended several measures intended to integrate the Doukhobors into Canadian society, notably through the education of their children in public schools. Around that time, the provincial government entered into direct negotiations with the Freedomite leadership. W. A. C. Bennett&#x27;s Social Credit government, which came to power in 1952, took a harder stance against the &quot;Doukhobor problem.&quot; In 1953, 174 children of the Sons of Freedom were forcibly interned by government agents in a residential school in New Denver, British Columbia. Abuse of the interned children was later alleged.

In less than fifty years, the Sons of Freedom committed 1,112 separate acts of violence and arson, costing over $20 million in damages; these acts include bombing and arson attacks on public schools, bombings of Canadian railway bridges and tracks, the bombing of a courthouse at Nelson, and the destruction of a power transmission tower servicing East Kootenay district, resulting in the loss of 1,200 jobs. Many of the independent and community Doukhobors believed the Sons of Freedom&#x27;s arson and bombings violated the Doukhobor central principle of nonviolence, and that they did not deserve to be called Doukhobors.

=== Doukhobors remaining in Russia ===
After the departure of the more zealous and uncompromising Doukhobors, and many community leaders, to Canada at the close of the Elisabethpol Governorate in the Caucasus Viceroyalty (now Azerbaijan), the former Doukhobor villages became mostly repopulated by Baptists. Elsewhere, some Doukhobors joined nearby Spiritual Christian groups.

Those who remained Doukhobors were required to submit to the state. Few protested against military service; of 837 Russian court-martial cases against conscientious objectors recorded between the beginning of World War I and April 1, 1917, 16 had Doukhobor defendants, none of whom hailed from the Transcaucasian provinces. Between 1921 and 1923, Verigin&#x27;s son Peter P. Verigin arranged the resettlement of 4,000 Doukhobors from the Ninotsminda (Bogdanovka) district in south Georgia to Rostov Oblast in southern Russia, and another 500 into Zaporizhzhia Oblast in Ukraine.

The Soviet reforms greatly affected the lives of the Doukhobors, both in their old villages in Georgia and in the new settlement areas in southern Russian and Ukraine. State anti-religious campaigns resulted in the suppression of Doukhobor religious tradition, and the loss of books and archival records. Many religious leaders were arrested or exiled; for example, 18 people were exiled from Gorelovka in 1930. Communists&#x27; imposition of collective farming did not contradict the Doukhobor way of life. Industrious Doukhobors made their collective farms prosperous, often specializing in cheesemaking.

Of the Doukhobor communities in the Soviet Union, those in South Georgia were the most sheltered from outside influence because of their geographic isolation in mountainous terrain, their location near the international border, and concomitant travel restrictions for outsiders.

== Hymnody ==
Doukhobor oral holy hymns, which they call the &quot;Book of Life&quot; (Russian: &quot;Zhivotnaya kniga&quot;), &quot;de facto&quot; replaced the written Bible. Their teaching is founded on this tradition. &quot;The Book of Life of the Doukhobors&quot; (1909) is the first printed hymnal containing songs in the Southern Russian dialect, which were composed to be sung aloud. Their prayer meetings and gatherings are dominated by the singing of &quot;a cappella&quot; psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.

== Population ==

In 2001, an estimated 20,000–40,000 people of Doukhobor heritage lived in Canada, 3,800 of whom claimed &quot;Doukhobor&quot; as their religious affiliation. An estimated 30,000 people of Doukhobor heritage live in Russia and neighbouring countries. In 2011, there were 2,290 Canadians who identified their religious affiliation as &quot;Doukhobor&quot;; in Russia there were 50 such persons by the mid-2000s.

=== Canada ===
CCUB, the Orthodox Doukhobors organization or Community Doukhobors, was succeeded by the Union of Spiritual Communities of Christ (USCC) formed by Peter P. Verigin, Peter V. Verigin&#x27;s son, in 1938. The largest and most active formal Doukhobor organization, it is headquartered in Grand Forks, British Columbia.

During the Canada 2011 Census, 2,290 persons in Canada—of whom 1,860 in British Columbia, 200 in Alberta, 185 in Saskatchewan, and 25 in Ontario—identified their religious affiliation as &quot;Doukhobor&quot;. The proportion of older people among these self-identified Doukhobors is higher than among the general population.
Twenty-eight percent of the self-identified Doukhobors in 2001 were over 65 (born before 1936), as compared to 12% of the entire population of Canadian respondents. The aging of the denomination is accompanied by its shrinkage, starting in the 1960s:

The number of Canadians with Doukhobor heritage is much higher than the number of those who consider themselves members of this religion. In 2012, Doukhobor researchers estimated there were &quot;over 20,000&quot; people &quot;from [Doukhobor] stock&quot; in Canada and over 40,000 Doukhobors by &quot;a wider definition of religion, ethnicity, way of life, and social movement&quot;.

Canadian Doukhobors no longer live communally. Doukhobors do not practice baptism, neither wet nor dry, nor require one to be &quot;born again&quot;. They reject several items considered orthodox among Christian churches, including church organization and liturgy, the inspiration of the scriptures, the literal interpretation of resurrection, the literal interpretation of the Trinity, and heaven and hell. Some avoid the use of alcohol, tobacco, and animal products for food, and eschew involvement in partisan politics. Doukhobors believe in the goodness of man and reject the idea of original sin.

=== Georgia and Russia ===

Since the late 1980s, many of the Doukhobors of Georgia started emigrating to Russia. Various groups moved to Tula Oblast, Rostov Oblast, Stavropol Krai, and elsewhere. After the 1991 independence of Georgia, many villages with Russian names received Georgian names; Bogdanovka became Ninotsminda, Troitskoe became Sameba. According to various estimates, in Ninotsminda District, the Doukhobor population fell from around 4,000 in 1979 to between 3,000 and 3,500 in 1989, and around 700 in 2006. In Dmanisi district, it fell from around 700 Doukhobors in 1979 to no more than 50 by the mid-2000s. Most of those who remain in Georgia are older people; the younger generation found it easier to relocate to Russia. The Doukhobor community of Gorelovka in Ninotsminda District, the former &quot;capital&quot; of the Kalmykov family, is thought to be the best-preserved in all former Soviet Union countries.

== Ecumenical relations ==
The Doukhobors have maintained a close association with Mennonites and Quakers due to similar religious practices; all of these groups are collectively considered to be peace churches due to their belief in pacifism.

== Historical sites and museums ==
In 1995, the Doukhobor Suspension Bridge spanning the Kootenay River was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. The site of Community Doukhobors&#x27; headquarters in Veregin, Saskatchewan, was designated a National Historic Site in 2006, under the name &quot;Doukhobors at Veregin&quot;.

A Doukhobor museum known as &quot;Doukhobor Discovery Centre&quot; (formerly, &quot;Doukhobor Village Museum&quot;) operates in Castlegar, British Columbia. It contains over 1,000 artifacts representing the arts, crafts, and daily lives of the Doukhobors of the Kootenays in 1908–38.

Although most of the early Doukhobor village structures in British Columbia have vanished or been significantly remodelled by later users, a part of Makortoff Village outside Grand Forks, British Columbia has been preserved as a museum by Peter Gritchen, who purchased the property in 1971 and opened it as Mountain View Doukhobor Museum on June 16, 1972. The site&#x27;s future became uncertain after his death in 2000 but in March 2004, in cooperation with local organizations and concerned citizens, The Land Conservancy of British Columbia purchased the historical site known as Hardy Mountain Doukhobor Village while Boundary Museum Society acquired the museum collection and loaned it to TLC for display.

The Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa has a collection of Doukhobor-related items. A special exhibition there was run in 1998–99 to mark the centennial anniversary of the Doukhobor arrival in Canada.

== Linguistic history and dialect ==
The Doukhobors took with them to Canada a Southern Russian dialect, which in the following decades changed under the influence of Canadian English and the speech of the Ukrainian settlers in Saskatchewan. Over several generations, this dialect has been mostly lost because the modern descendants of the original Doukhobor migrants to Canada are typically native English speakers; when they speak Russian, it is typically a fairly standard variety.

=== Linguistic history ===
In 1802, the Doukhobors and other spiritual Christian tribes were encouraged to migrate to the Molochna River region around Melitopol near Ukraine&#x27;s Sea of Azov coast, within the Pale of Settlement neighbouring settlements of anabaptists from Germany. Over the next 10 or 20 years, the Doukhobors and others, mostly speaking a variety of Southern Russian dialects, arrived at the Molochna from several provinces, most of which are located in modern-day eastern Ukraine and south-central Russia. In the settlers&#x27; villages, an opportunity for the formation of a dialect koiné based on Southern Russian and Eastern Ukrainian dialects arose.

Starting in 1841, the Doukhobors and others were resettled from southern Ukraine to Transcaucasia, where they founded several villages surrounded by mostly non-Russian speaking neighbours—primarily Azerbaijanis in Elisabethpol Governorate, Armenians in Tiflis Governorate, and likely a mix of both in the later post-1878 settlements in Kars Oblast. These conditions allowed the dialect to develop in comparative isolation from mainstream Russian.

With the migration of 7,500 Doukhbors from Transcaucasia to Saskatchewan in 1899, and some smaller latecomer groups from both Transcaucasia and from places of exile in Siberia and elsewhere, the dialect spoken in the Doukhobor villages of Transcaucasia was taken to the plains of Canada. From that point, it experienced influence from Canadian English and, during the years of Doukhobor stay in Saskatchewan, the speech of their Ukrainian neighbours.

A split in the Doukhobor community resulted in a large number of Doukhobors moving from Saskatchewan to south-eastern British Columbia around 1910. Those who moved, the so-called Community Doukhobors—followers of Peter Verigin&#x27;s Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood—continued living communally for several decades, and had a better chance to preserve their Russian language than the Independent Doukhobors, who stayed in Saskatchewan as individual farmers.

By the 1970s, as most Russian-born members of the community died, English became the first language of the great majority of Canadian Doukhobors. Their English speech is not noticeably different from that of other English-speaking Canadians of their provinces. Russian still remains in use, at least for religious purposes, among those who practice the Doukhobor religion.

=== Features of the Doukhobor Russian dialect in Canada ===
Research into the Russian spoken by Canada&#x27;s Doukhobors has not been extensive but several articles, mostly published in the 1960s and 1970s, noted a variety of features in Doukhobors&#x27; Russian speech that were characteristic of Southern, and in some cases Central Russian dialects; for example, use of the Southern [h] where Standard Russian has [g].

Features characteristic of many locales in the East Slavic language space were noted, reflecting the heterogeneous origin of the Doukhobors&#x27; settlements in Molochna River after 1800; for example, like Belarusians, Doukhobor speakers do not palatalize [r] in &quot;редко&quot; (&quot;redko&quot;, &#x27;seldom&#x27;). Remarkable was the dropping of the final -t in the third-person singular form of verbs, which can be considered a Ukrainian feature and is also attested in some Russian dialects spoken in Southern Ukraine (e.g., Nikolaev near the Doukhobors&#x27; former homeland on the Molochna). As with other immigrant groups, the Russian speech of the Doukhobors uses English loanwords for some concepts they had not encountered until moving to Canada.

<doc id="376174" wikidata="Q3468104" url="?curid=376174" title="Streetcars in New Orleans">
<text>Streetcars have been an integral part of the public transportation network of New Orleans since the first half of the 19th century. The longest of the city&#x27;s streetcar lines, the St. Charles Avenue line, is the oldest continuously operating street railway system in the world. Today, the streetcars are operated by the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority (RTA).

There are currently five operating streetcar lines in New Orleans: The St. Charles Avenue Line, the Loyola–Riverfront Line, the Canal Street Line (which has two branches), and the Rampart-Loyola Line. The St. Charles Avenue Line is the only line that has operated continuously throughout New Orleans&#x27; streetcar history (though service was interrupted after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and resumed only in part in December 2006, as noted below). All other lines were replaced by bus service in the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Preservationists were unable to save the streetcars on Canal Street, but were able to convince the city government to protect the St. Charles Avenue Line by granting it historic landmark status. In the later 20th century, trends began to favor rail transit again. A short Riverfront Line started service in 1988, and service returned to Canal Street in 2004, 40 years after it had been shut down.

The wide destruction wrought on the city by Hurricane Katrina and subsequent floods from the levee breaches in August 2005 knocked all the streetcar lines out of operation and damaged many of the streetcars. Service on a portion of the Canal Street line was restored in December of that year, with the remainder of the line and the Riverfront line returning to service in early 2006. On December 23, 2007, the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) extended service on the St. Charles line from Napoleon Avenue to the end of historic St. Charles Avenue (the &quot;Riverbend&quot;). On June 22, 2008, service was restored to the end of the line at South Carrollton Avenue &amp; South Claiborne Avenue.

The streetcars are often changed or decorated for holidays and major sports events. For example, they are usually decorated for Christmas.

==History==

The definitive history of New Orleans streetcars is found in Louis Hennick and Harper Charlton, &quot;The Streetcars of New Orleans,&quot; which is the source for this summary of New Orleans streetcar history.

===Beginnings===
On April 23, 1831, the Pontchartrain Railroad Company (PRR) established the first rail service in New Orleans along a five-mile line running north on Elysian Fields Avenue from the Mississippi River toward Lake Pontchartrain. These first trains, however, were pulled by horses because the engines had not yet arrived from England. The PRR received its first working steam engine the next year, and first put it into service on September 27, 1832. Service continued in a mixed fashion, running sometimes with locomotives, and at other times with horse traction. A round trip fare at that time was seventy-five cents.

Those first operations included inter-city and suburban railroad lines, and horse-drawn (or mule-drawn) omnibus lines. The first lines of city rail service were created by the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad, which in 1835 opened three lines. In the first week of January, the company opened its Poydras-Magazine horse-drawn line on its namesake streets (Poydras Street and Magazine Street), the first true street railway line in the city. New York City was the only place to precede New Orleans with street railway service. Then a horse-drawn line to the suburb of Lafayette, which was centered on Jackson Avenue, opened on January 13. In September, the New Orleans and Carrollton started operating its third line, a steam-powered line along present-day St. Charles Avenue, then called Nayades, connecting the city with the suburb of Carrollton, and terminating near the present-day intersection of St. Charles Avenue and Carrollton Avenue. The Poydras-Magazine line ceased operation in March or April 1836, about the time that a new La Course Street line was opened along that street (now named Race Street). That line ended in the 1840s, but the Lafayette and Carrollton lines continued, eventually becoming the Jackson and St. Charles streetcar lines.

As the area upriver (uptown) from the city began to be built up—much of the new development along the Nayades (St. Charles Avenue) corridor—additional lines were created by the New Orleans and Carrollton. On February 4, 1850, branch lines were opened on Louisiana and Napoleon Avenues. Like the Jackson line, these were horse- or mule-drawn cars, operating from Nayades Avenue to the river along their namesake streets. The Louisiana line was lightly patronized, and was discontinued in 1878. The Napoleon line continued into the next century.

Up until about 1860, omnibus lines provided the only public transit outside the area serviced by the New Orleans and Carrollton RR. The need was felt for a true citywide street railway service. Toward this end, the New Orleans City RR was chartered on June 15, 1860. The first line, Rampart and Esplanade (later called simply Esplanade), opened June 1, 1861, followed in quick succession by the Magazine, Camp and Prytania (later called Prytania), Canal, Rampart and Dauphine (later Dauphine), and finally Bayou Bridge and City Park. Despite the beginnings of war, the company opened and continued service on its new lines. A few other efforts were attempted during the Civil War, but progress resumed soon after the war&#x27;s end.

In 1866, several additional street railway companies made their appearance in New Orleans. The first was the Magazine Street Railroad Co., which soon merged with the second, the Crescent City Railroad Co. The St. Charles Street Railroad Co. was next, followed in 1867 by the Canal and Claiborne Streets Railroad Co. and in 1868 by the Orleans Railroad Co. The horsecar lines of these companies covered different parts of the city, overlapping in some areas. The City RR even operated a steam railroad to Lake Pontchartrain, the West End line, which eventually became part of the city streetcar system.

===Desegregation protests===
Streetcars in New Orleans had been segregated since they were introduced. A few separate cars marked with stars were designated for black people - the so-called &quot;star car&quot; system.

In April 1867, William Nichols got onto a white-only car and was forced out. In the following weeks, thousands of African Americans engaged in protests and some riots broke out. Fearing the repetition of violence seen in previous years, the city, by May 8, desegregated the streetcar system. The chief of police told his officers: “Have no interference with negroes riding in cars of any kind. No passenger, has a right to eject any other passenger, no matter what his color.”

The streetcar system remained integrated until 1902.

===Horsecar companies and lines operated===
In the late 1800s, these were the streetcar companies and the lines they operated:

* New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Co.:
** Carrollton
** Jackson
** Louisiana
** Napoleon
* New Orleans City Railroad Co.:
** Esplanade

* Canal and Claiborne Streets Railroad Co.:
** Claiborne (North)
** Tulane
** Girod and Poydras

** Bayou St. John
** Broad
** City Park
** French Market
===The coming of electrification===

A number of experiments were tried out over the next few decades in an attempt to find a better method than horses or mules for propulsion of streetcars. These included an overhead cable car system (an underground cable, such as was eventually developed in San Francisco, was impossible because of the high water table under New Orleans); a walking beam system; pneumatic propulsion; an ammonia locomotive; a &quot;Thermo-specific&quot; system using super-heated water; and the Lamm Fireless engine. Lamm engines were actually adopted and used for a time on the New Orleans and Carrollton line, which had previously used steam locomotives. That line gradually gave up steam locomotives because of the objections of residents along the line to the smoke, soot, and noise. The area between the town of Carrollton and the City of New Orleans was sparsely populated with large swaths of agricultural land when the line was laid out in the 1830s; by the latter 19th century it was almost completely urbanized. Carrollton was annexed to New Orleans in 1874. Due to this increased urbanization, horsecars were used on the entire line.

Electrical propulsion of streetcars finally won out over all the other experimental methods. Electric powered streetcars made their first appearance in New Orleans on the Carrollton line on February 1, 1893. The line was also extended out Carrollton Avenue and renamed St. Charles.

Other companies followed suit. Over the next few years, almost all the streetcar lines of all six companies were electrified, including the West End steam line; the few lines that remained animal powered, such as the Girod and Poydras, were discontinued. Also, operations of the six companies began to be consolidated at this time, beginning with formation of the New Orleans Traction Co., which took over operation of the New Orleans City and Lake RR (an 1883 renaming of the New Orleans City RR) and the Crescent City RR in 1892. New Orleans Traction became the New Orleans City RR in 1899, the second company to use that name. The Canal and Claiborne company was merged into the New Orleans and Carrollton in 1899. Then in 1902, New Orleans Railways Co. took over operation of all city streetcars, and in 1905 the operating company became New Orleans Railway and Light Co. Final consolidation of ownership as well as operation finally became reality in 1922 with the formation of New Orleans Public Service Incorporated (commonly abbreviated NOPSI, never NOPS).

===Electric streetcars under consolidated operation===
Labor problems began to occupy the attention of street railway officials as consolidation progressed. At first, each of the street railway companies had its own agreement with its operating personnel. New Orleans Railways tried to maintain those separate agreements, but labor representatives insisted on one agreement for the entire company. They also demanded an increase in pay and recognition of their union, Division 194 of the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees of America. The union struck on September 27, 1902. After about two weeks of strife, a settlement was reached, and in early 1903, the company signed a contract and recognized the union.

In 1902, there were protests when the Louisiana legislature mandated that public transportation must enforce racial segregation. At first this was objected to by both white and black riders as an inconvenience, and by the streetcar companies on grounds of both added expense and the difficulties of determining the racial background of some New Orleanians.

Consolidation of operations under a single company had the advantage of untangling and rationalizing some streetcar lines. As an extreme example, consider the Coliseum line, which had the nickname Snake Line, because it wandered all over uptown New Orleans. Its early name Canal and Coliseum and Upper Magazine gives an idea of the route. Under consolidation, Coliseum was pretty much limited to service on its namesake street, with trackage on upper Magazine Street turned over to the Magazine line, as one might expect. Other efficiencies were instituted, such as reducing the number of streetcar lines operating over long stretches of Canal Street.

There was another strike beginning July 1, 1920. This one was settled around the end of July with a new contract.

In the early 1920s, several extensions and rearrangements of service resulted in the inauguration of the famous Desire line, the Freret line, the Gentilly line, and the St. Claude line.

In 1929, there was a widespread strike by transit workers demanding better pay, which was widely supported by much of the public. Sandwiches on baguettes were given to the &quot;poor boys&quot; on strike, said to be the origin of the local name of &quot;po&#x27; boy&quot; sandwiches. There was much rioting and animosity. Several streetcars were burned, and several people were killed. Service was gradually restored, with the strike ending in October.

The same year, the last of the tracks were converted to (Pennsylvania trolley gauge) to match the rest of the streetcar lines.

Buses began to be used in New Orleans transit in 1924. Several streetcar lines were converted to bus or were abandoned outright over the next 15 years. Beginning after World War II, as in much of the United States, almost all streetcar lines were replaced with buses, either internal combustion (gasoline/diesel) or electric (trolley bus). See the Historic Lines section below. Track and overhead wire of abandoned or converted lines were generally removed, although remnants of abandoned track remain in a few places around the city.

The last four streetcar lines in New Orleans were the S. Claiborne and Napoleon lines, which were converted to motor bus in 1953; the Canal, which was converted in 1964; and the St. Charles, which has continued in operation, and now has historic landmark status.

Racial segregation on streetcars and buses in New Orleans was finally ended peacefully in 1958.
Until then, signs separating the races were carried on the backs of the seats in streetcars and buses. These signs could be moved forward or back in the vehicle as passenger loads changed during the operating day. Under court order, the signs were simply removed, and passengers were allowed to sit wherever they pleased.

In 1974, the Amalgamated won a representation election and formed Local Division 1560 in New Orleans. Negotiations between the union and NOPSI were unsuccessful, and a strike followed. In December 1974, a contract was signed between NOPSI and Local 1560, but the strike was not completely settled until the following March.

===Streetcars under RTA===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, it became apparent that private operation of the New Orleans transit system could not continue. Creation of a public body that could receive tax money and qualify for federal funding was necessary. The Louisiana legislature created the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority (RTA) in 1979, and in 1983, RTA took over ownership and operation of the system.

In 1988, a new Riverfront line was created, using private right of way along the river levee. This was the first new streetcar line in New Orleans since 1926. Then in 2004, the Canal line was reconstructed and restored to rail operation. An all-new line on Loyola Avenue was opened in 2013. It was extended across Canal Street on Rampart Street and St. Claude Avenue in 2016 in a short form of the historic St. Claude streetcar line. See the Current Lines and Future Network Expansion sections below.

===Hurricane Katrina===

The area through which the St. Charles Avenue Line traveled fared comparatively well in Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s devastating impact on New Orleans at the end of August 2005, with moderate flooding only of the two ends of the line at Claiborne Avenue and at Canal Street. However, wind damage and falling trees took out many sections of trolley wire along St. Charles Avenue, and vehicles parked on the neutral ground (traffic medians) over the inactive tracks degraded parts of the right-of-way. At the start of October 2005, as this part of town started being repopulated, bus service began running on the St. Charles line.

The section running from Canal Street to Lee Circle via Carondelet Street and St. Charles Street in the Central Business District was restored December 19, 2006 at 10:30 a.m. Central time. Service from Lee Circle to Napoleon Avenue in uptown New Orleans was restored November 10, 2007 at 2:00 p.m. RTA restored streetcar service on the rest of St. Charles Ave. on December 23, 2007. Service along the remainder of the line on Carrollton Ave. to Claiborne Avenue resumed June 22, 2008. The time was needed to repair the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina and to perform other maintenance and upgrades to the lines that had been scheduled before the hurricane. Leaving the line shut down and the electrical system unpowered allowed the upgrades to be performed more safely and easily.

Perhaps more serious was the effect on the system&#x27;s rolling stock. The vintage green streetcars rode out the storm in the sealed barn in a portion of Old Carrollton that did not flood, and were undamaged. However, the newer red cars (with the exception of one which was in Carrollton for repair work at the time) were in a different barn that unfortunately &quot;did&quot; flood, and all of them were rendered inoperable; early estimates were that each car would cost between $800,000 and $1,000,000 to restore. In December 2006, RTA received a $46 million grant to help pay for the car restoration efforts. The first restored cars were to be placed in service early in 2009.

Service on the Canal Street Line was restored in December 2005, with several historic St. Charles line green cars transferred to serve there while the flood-damaged red cars were being repaired. The eventual reopening of all lines was made a major priority for the city as it rebuilt.

Brookville Equipment Corporation (BEC) of Pennsylvania was awarded the contract to provide the components to rebuild 31 New Orleans&#x27; streetcars to help the city bring its transportation infrastructure closer to full capacity. The streetcars were submerged in over five feet of water while parked in their car barn, and all electrical components affected by the flooding had to be replaced. BEC&#x27;s engineering and drafting departments immediately began work on this three-year project to return these New Orleans icons to service. The trucks for the cars were remanufactured by BEC with upgraded drives from Saminco and new control systems from TMV Control Systems. Painting, body work, and final assembly of the restored streetcars was carried out by RTA craftsmen at Carrollton Station Shops. As of March 2009, sufficient red cars had been repaired to take over all service on the Canal Street and Riverfront lines. As of June 2009, the last three Canal Street cars were scheduled for repair. The seven Riverfront cars were worked on next; they began to return to service in early 2010.

==Current lines==
* The St. Charles Streetcar Line is the oldest continuously operating streetcar line in the world, having opened in 1835. It runs from Canal Street all the way to the end of St. Charles Avenue at South Carrollton Avenue, then out South Carrollton Avenue to its terminal at Carrollton and Claiborne.
* The Rampart–Loyola Streetcar Line originally opened as an extension of the Loyola–UPT Streetcar Line on October 2, 2016, running from the Union Passenger Terminal down Loyola Avenue to Canal Street before turning quickly onto Rampart Street, continuing to Saint Claude Avenue at Elysian Fields Avenue. This extension of the line to Elysian Fields Avenue was known as the French Quarter Rail Expansion and entailed building of track with six sheltered stops, and with track laid in the street next to the neutral ground, like the track for the original 2013 portion of the line. Preparation for construction began in December 2014, and a groundbreaking ceremony was held January 28, 2015 to begin actual construction. After operating for just over three years as the Rampart–St. Claude Streetcar Line, service on the line was suspended in October 2019 following the collapse of the Hard Rock Hotel at the corner of Canal and Rampart. After the hotel&#x27;s removal, service remained suspended for several years reportedly due to supply shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; service returned on May 19, 2024 with the line now referred to as the Rampart–Loyola Streetcar Line.
* The Canal Streetcar Line, which originally operated from 1861 to 1964 and which was rebuilt and reopened in 2004, runs the entire length of Canal Street, from near the Mississippi River to the cemeteries at City Park Avenue. A branch streetcar line turns off of Canal Street into North Carrollton Avenue to the entrance of City Park at Esplanade Avenue, near the New Orleans Museum of Art. Beginning July 31, 2017, and completed on December 4, a new loop terminal for the Cemeteries Branch was built north of City Park Avenue on Canal Boulevard, providing passengers with better access to transfer between the streetcars and connecting bus lines. Following a month of testing and training, the new loop went into service January 7, 2018. At times in the past, some Canal cars have operated through on the Riverfront tracks from the French Market terminal to Canal Street, before proceeding out Canal.
* The Loyola–Riverfront Streetcar Line, originally known as the Loyola–UPT Streetcar Line, started service on January 28, 2013. It runs along Loyola Avenue from New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal to Canal Street. Initially it continued on Canal Street to Convention Center Boulevard before running along the riverfront in front of the French Quarter to the French Market at Esplanade Avenue. Service was offered to Convention Center Boulevard and Canal with weekend extensions to the French Market. As a result of the 2019 Hard Rock Hotel collapse on Canal Street and construction of the Four Seasons Hotel preventing access to the Julia and Poydras street stops on the riverfront, in late 2021 Loyola streetcars began running the initial weekend-only route between UPT and the French Market daily; this route was officially renamed as the UPT-Riverfront line sometime in 2023. In 2024, following the reopening of the Rampart Section, it was renamed the Loyola–Riverfront Streetcar Line.

==Former lines==
* The Riverfront Streetcar Line opened October 14, 1988, and ran parallel to the river from Esplanade Avenue along the edge of the French Quarter, past Canal Street, to the Convention Center above Julia Street in the Arts District. In spring 2018, construction of the Four Seasons Hotel resulted in the Poydras and Julia Street stops being removed from service; streetcars shuttled between Canal at Harrah&#x27;s Casino and the French Market. As of 2024, it has been merged with the 49 Loyola-UPT Line to create the Loyola–Riverfront Line. NORTA has not indicated whether the Poydras and Julia Street stops will be back in service in the future.

==Future network expansion==
RTA has plans to extend the Rampart-St. Claude line past its present terminal at St. Claude and Elysian Fields to Press Street, and also down Elysian Fields to the river to connect with the Riverfront line.
These plans are not funded, and are on hold as more urgent needs are considered for funding.

There was a proposal, along with the general redevelopment of Claiborne Avenue, to build a streetcar line on N. Claiborne Avenue running from Poydras Street to Elysian Fields. However, it appears this proposal was never seriously considered and is unlikely to be fulfilled.

==Current rolling stock==
The St. Charles Avenue Line has traditionally used streetcars of the type that were common all over the United States in the early parts of the 20th century. Most of the streetcars running on this line are Perley Thomas cars dating from the 1920s. The one exception is an 1890s vintage streetcar that is still in running condition; it is used for maintenance and special purposes. Unlike most North American cities with streetcar systems, New Orleans never adopted PCC cars in the 1930s or 1940s, and never traded in older streetcars for modern light rail vehicles in the later 20th century. New Orleanians also continue to prefer use of the term &quot;streetcar&quot;, rather than &quot;trolley&quot;, &quot;tram&quot;, or &quot;light rail&quot;.

In the Carrollton neighborhood, the RTA has a streetcar barn, called Carrollton Station, where the streetcars of the city&#x27;s lines are stored and maintained. The block wide complex consists of two buildings: an older car barn at Dante and Jeannette Streets and a newer barn at Willow and Dublin Streets. The shop there has become capable of duplicating any part needed for the vintage cars.

With the addition of the new Riverfront and Canal lines, more vehicles were needed for the system. The RTA&#x27;s shops built two groups of modern cars as near duplicates of the older cars in appearance. One group of seven cars was built for the Riverfront line in 1997, and another group for the restored Canal Street line in 1999 (one car) and 2002–2003 (23 cars). The trucks for the 2002–2003 cars were manufactured by Brookville Equipment Corporation. These new cars can be distinguished from the older vehicles by their bright red color; unlike the older cars, they are ADA-compliant, and the Canal Street cars are air conditioned.

Before Hurricane Katrina, the historic cars ran exclusively on the St. Charles Avenue Line, and the newer cars on the other two lines. However, in the wake of hurricane damage to the St. Charles line tracks and overhead wires, and to almost all of the new red cars, the older cars were run on Canal Street and Riverfront until the new cars could be repaired. Using whatever worked wherever it could be run continued for several years. By 2010 enough restored streetcars were back in service to again confine the historic Perley Thomas cars to the St. Charles line.

In late 2020, RTA reworked three, and later a fourth, of the ADA compliant Riverfront streetcars, numbers 460-463, to provide wheelchair service on the St.Charles streetcar line. They were repainted in the same shade of green as the iconic 900 series cars.

==Historic lines==

In the mid 19th to early 20th century, the city had dozens of lines, including:
* Poydras-Magazine (January 1835 – March/April 1836) – Though short-lived, this was the first true streetcar line to begin operation in New Orleans, having opened the first week of January 1835.
* Jackson (January 13, 1835 – May 19, 1947) – This long-running line also opened before the St. Charles line, on January 13, 1835. Replaced with trolley bus and later diesel bus service.
* Louisiana (February 4, 1850 – 1878, August 27, 1913 – December 27, 1934) – The original 1850–1878 Louisiana Line was a branch line of the New Orleans &amp; Carrollton, running on Louisiana from St. Charles to the river at Tchoupitoulas. The later 1913–1934 line ran from Canal Street up to Louisiana Ave. on Freret and Howard (now LaSalle) Streets, then to Tchoupitoulas. For part of its life, it terminated on Canal Street at the ferry landing.
* Napoleon (February 4, 1850 – February 18, 1953) – Like the Louisiana Line, the original Napoleon Ave. line was a branch line of the New Orleans &amp; Carrollton, running on Napoleon from St. Charles Ave. to the river at Tchoupitoulas. Unlike the Louisiana, it was extended to Canal Street when electrified in 1893. A second line, popularly known as the Royal Blue Line, was opened on January 1, 1903 from St. Charles out to the end of the Avenue at Broad Street. The two were combined in 1906. With the Shrewsbury Extension on Metairie Road, which operated from 1915–1934, this was the longest streetcar line in New Orleans. Its routing was as follows: on Napoleon Ave. from Tchoupitoulas to S. Broad, then turning right onto S. Broad, left onto Washington Ave. (running between the street and the Palmetto-Washington drainage canal), right onto S. Carrollton Ave., left onto Pontchartrain Blvd. (this would now be impossible due to the presence of the Pontchartrain Expressway / I-10), left onto Metairie Rd., then zig-zagging through several Old Metairie streets to a terminus at Cypress and Shrewsbury Rd. (now Severn Ave.).

* Esplanade (June 1, 1861 – December 27, 1934) – This was the first streetcar line to traverse the &quot;back-of-town&quot; section of New Orleans, running all the way out Esplanade Ave. to Bayou St. John in its original routing. From 1901–1934 the Canal and Esplanade lines operated in a loop as the Canal-Esplanade Belt, until Esplanade Ave. went to buses in 1934.
* Coliseum (originally Canal and Coliseum and Upper Magazine) (September 1, 1881 – May 11, 1929) – Known as the &quot;Snake Line&quot; because it curved all over the place in uptown New Orleans. Originally operating on Coliseum Street from Canal to Louisiana, it was extended piece by piece over the years, first on Magazine to the present Audubon Park, then through the park to Broadway and then across to Carrollton Ave., where it connected to the loop on Oak and Willow Streets from Carrollton to the Orleans-Jefferson parish line. Beginning in 1913, however, the Magazine Line took over all trackage on Magazine Street, and a shorter Coliseum Line ended near Audubon Park.
* Magazine (June 8, 1861 – February 11, 1948) – Its longest routing, in the 1910s, took it all the way from Canal Street, up Magazine and Broadway to S. Claiborne Ave. Replaced with trolley bus and later diesel bus service.

* Prytania (June 8, 1861 – October 1, 1932) – Known as the &quot;Silk Stocking Line&quot;, Prytania ran through the Garden District on its namesake street.
* Bayou Bridge and City Park (mid-1861 – December 22, 1894, route absorbed into Esplanade line) – This early line ran the full length of the present-day City Park Ave. (then called Metairie Rd.).
* Tchoupitoulas (August 10, 1866 – July 2, 1929) – This early riverfront line once ran the full-length of Tchoupitoulas St. from Canal Street to Audubon Park.
* N. Claiborne (May 13, 1868 – December 27, 1934) – This was a downtown (i.e., downriver) line. From 1917 to 1925, it was operated as a single line with the Jackson Line.
* Tulane (originally Canal &amp; Common) (January 15, 1871 – January 8, 1951) – From 1900–1951 the St. Charles and Tulane lines operated in a loop as the St. Charles-Tulane Belt, taking passengers past the beautiful homes on St. Charles Ave., up S. Carrollton Ave. past the St. Charles Line&#x27;s present terminal at S. Claiborne Ave., across the New Basin Canal (now the site of the Pontchartrain Expressway), turning at the former Pelican Stadium onto Tulane Ave. and back downtown. The Tulane Avenue service became a trolley bus and later a diesel bus route.
* Broad (originally Canal, Dumaine &amp; Fair Grounds) (1874 – July 16, 1932) – After 1915, the Broad Line had two branches, on St. Bernard and Paris Avenues.

* Clio (January 23, 1867 - September 1, 1932) - This line originally ran from Canal Street up St. Charles Street and over to Clio Street to Magnolia Street, returning on Erato and Carondelet Streets. In 1874, it was extended across Canal Street to Elysian Fields, making it the first streetcar line to cross Canal Street. It was extended at both ends from time to time, before giving up its territory to newer lines in 1932.
* Carondelet (July 29, 1866 - September 7, 1924) - This uptown line ran on its namesake street from Canal Street to Napoleon Ave. At its most extensive, it also ran on Freret Street from Napoleon to Broadway, on trackage that eventually became part of the Freret line, and it crossed Canal Street into the French Quarter, pioneering the route of the later Desire line.
* Annunciation (February 27, 1867 - December 23, 1917) and Laurel (August 12, 1913 - July 5, 1939) - These were uptown lines near the River, running on Annunciation and Chippewa Streets, and on Laurel and Constance Streets.
* West End (April 20, 1876 – January 15, 1950) – This line is still fondly remembered for its jaunty ride through the grassy right-of-way along the New Basin Canal (now filled in) to the popular West End area on Lake Pontchartrain.
* Spanish Fort (March 26, 1911 – October 16, 1932) – Further east along Lake Pontchartrain at the mouth of Bayou St. John was another amusement area built around an old fort. This was the original location of Pontchartrain Beach before it moved further east to Elysian Fields Ave. The Spanish Fort Line branched off of the West End Line at what is now Allen Toussaint Boulevard.
* S. Claiborne (February 22, 1915 – January 5, 1953) – In its later years, this line operated at the edges of the neutral ground, which covered a large drainage canal, part of which was open. The part of the neutral ground that was covered was planted in grass and ornamental trees and bushes, and was quite beautiful. Replaced by diesel bus service.
* Desire (October 17, 1920 – May 29, 1948) – This line ran through the French Quarter down to its namesake street in the Bywater district. It was immortalized in Tennessee Williams&#x27; play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. The line was converted to buses in 1948. Various proposals to revive a streetcar line with this name have been discussed in recent years, but the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority has no current plans to rebuild. Enthusiasts are nicknaming the new St. Claude line the &quot;Desire line&quot;, despite the former and latter each having run on separate and distinct routes. For many years, a 1906 Brill-built semi-convertible streetcar was displayed in the French Market with a Desire route sign, although there is no evidence that cars of this type ever served the Desire Line. At first it was under cover; later out in the open, it deteriorated from the weather, and in the 1990s it was turned over to New Orleans RTA. It is currently housed at Carrollton Station in the car shops.
* Freret (September 7, 1924 – December 1, 1946) – Created from trackage formerly part of the Carondelet line. Replaced with trolley bus and later diesel bus service.
* St. Claude (February 21, 1926 – January 1, 1949) – This and the Gentilly Line were the last two streetcar lines to open in New Orleans until the August 1988 inauguration of the Riverfront line. Replaced with trolley bus and later diesel bus service. The New Orleans Regional Transit Authority has plans to rebuild a similar route.
* Gentilly (February 21, 1926 – July 17, 1948) – Gentilly was derived from the old Villere Line. It was unusual in being named for the neighborhood it served, rather than the street along which it ran. At one end, it traversed the French Quarter. Then it turned up Almonaster (now Franklin) to its outer terminal at Dreux. Replaced by diesel bus service, which was eventually renamed Franklin for the street.
* Orleans/Kenner interurban (or O.K. Line) – This line operated between 1915 and 1931 and connected New Orleans to Kenner. It began at the intersection of Rampart and Canal in New Orleans and followed the Tulane streetcar line to the intersection of S. Carrollton with S. Claiborne, then proceeded along the route of the present-day Jefferson Hwy. through Jefferson Parish to the St. Charles Parish Line in an area then known as Hanson City (now part of Kenner). This line was not a NOPSI service, although it came under NOPSI control in the late 1920s.

==Preserved streetcars==

In addition to the 35 Perley Thomas-built 900-series streetcars that serve the St. Charles line, the following New Orleans streetcars have been preserved in various ways.

* Preserved in New Orleans

453: The last of the 25 Brill semi-convertible cars. It was on display at the French Market and later at the Mint, but exposure to the weather caused its deterioration. It is known in posed pictures as the Streetcar Named Desire, although there is no evidence that this class of streetcar ever ran on the Desire line. It is currently stored inoperative at Carrollton Station, but it could be restored for operation.

919 and 924: These two Perley Thomas cars, originally twins to the 35 900-series cars running on the St. Charles line, were sold in 1964 when the Canal line was discontinued. They were bought back by RTA in 1985 and refurbished for service on the Riverfront line, beginning August 14, 1988. They were given Riverfront car numbers 451 and 450, respectively. They were again retired in 1997 when the Riverfront line was re-equipped with new cars 457-463. They are currently stored inoperative at Carrollton Station, but they could be restored for operation.

957: When the Canal line was discontinued in 1964, this car was sold to the Trinity Valley Railroad Club in Weatherford, Texas, west of Fort Worth. Then it was sold to the Spaghetti Warehouse Company, then to the McKinney Avenue Transit Authority in Dallas, Texas, and finally it was purchased by New Orleans RTA in 1986. It was stored until 1997, when it was rebuilt with a wheelchair lift and modern controls, becoming the first of the new 457-463 series cars for the re-equipment of the Riverfront line.

* Preserved for revenue operation in San Francisco

952: This Perley Thomas car was sold in 1964 when the Canal line was discontinued, and was bought back by RTA in 1990 and refurbished for service on the Riverfront line. As number 456, it served Riverfront until 1997. After its second retirement, it was rebuilt in the same manner as the 35 St. Charles line cars, given its original number, and sent on long-term loan to the San Francisco Municipal Railway, where it operates on that city&#x27;s E-Embarcadero and F-Market &amp; Warves lines as part of the Heritage Fleet.

913: This car was sold to the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Riverside County, California in 1964 when the Canal line was discontinued. Later, it was sold to San Francisco Municipal Railway to augment service there by car 952. So far, it has not been refurbished for service, but is stored for future use.

* Preserved at museums and heritage operations

832: At Pennsylvania Trolley Museum at Washington, Pennsylvania.
836: At Connecticut Trolley Museum at East Windsor, Connecticut.
850: At Shore Line Trolley Museum at Branford, Connecticut.
These are the last three 800-series cars in existence. All were built by Perley Thomas in 1922. The museums have restored all three to like-new condition, and operate them on museum property.

918: Now at North Carolina Transportation Museum, Spencer, NC, intended for cosmetic restoration. For a time, it was stored at Thomas Built Buses, the current name of its builder, Perley Thomas Car Co.

966: Owned by Seashore Trolley Museum, Kennebunkport, Maine, and operated at Lowell National Historical Park, Massachusetts.

<text>The Parliament of Canada is the legislative body of the government of Canada. The Parliament is composed of the House of Commons (lower house), the Senate (upper house), and the sovereign, represented by the governor general. Most major legislation originates from the House, as it is the only body that is directly elected. A new parliament begins after an election of the House of Commons and can sit for up to five years. The number of seats in parliament has varied as new provinces joined the country and as population distribution between the provinces changed; there are currently 338 House MPs and 105 Senators (when there are no vacancies).

Canada uses a Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even if the leader is not an elected member of parliament. The leader of the party with the second-most seats in the House becomes the leader of the Official Opposition, and debate (formally called Oral Questions) between the parties is presided over by the speaker of the House. When the party with the most seats has less than half of the total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by the other parties. The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa, Ontario.

<text>The Wiggles are an Australian children&#x27;s music group formed in Sydney in 1991. As of 2022, the group members are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, Tsehay Hawkins, Evie Ferris, John Pearce, Caterina Mete and Lucia Field. The Wiggles were founded in 1991 by Anthony Field, Murray Cook, Jeff Fatt, Greg Page and Phillip Wilcher. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Cook, Fatt and Page retired and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce and Emma Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects, while engaging in occasional reunion performances. Watkins departed the group in 2021, with the group subsequently adopting an expanded line-up of eight members.

Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band the Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children&#x27;s music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and he enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time. The group augmented their act with costumed characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus and Wags the Dog, as well as the human character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993. Shirley Shawn the Unicorn was later introduced. They originally travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group&#x27;s albums, DVDs and television programs have been produced independently since their inception. The height of their popularity came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market.

The group were formally consolidated in 2005. They were listed at the top of &quot;Business Review Weekly&quot;″s top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row and earned A$45 million in 2009. The Wiggles have enjoyed almost universal approval throughout their history, and their music has been played in pre-schools all over the world. They have earned multiple Gold, Platinum and double Platinum records; have sold 23 million DVDs and 7 million CDs; and have performed, on average, to one million people per year. The band has earned multiple Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) and Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards, and they have been inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.

==History==
===1988–1991: Background===
Anthony Field and Jeff Fatt were members of the Cockroaches, a Sydney pop band known for their &quot;good-time R&amp;B material&quot; and several singles recorded by independent labels during the 1980s. In 1988, Field&#x27;s infant niece, who was the daughter of Cockroaches founder and band member Paul Field, died of SIDS, causing the group to disband. Anthony Field enrolled at Macquarie University in Sydney to complete his degree in early childhood education, and later stated that his niece&#x27;s death &quot;ultimately led to the formation of [the] Wiggles&quot;. Murray Cook, also &quot;a mature-aged student&quot;, was the guitarist in the pub rock band Bang Shang a Lang before enrolling at Macquarie. Greg Page, who had been a roadie for and sang with the Cockroaches during their final years, had enrolled in Macquarie to study early childhood education on Field&#x27;s recommendation. Field, Cook, and Page were among approximately 10 men in a program with 200 students.

In 1991, while still a student, Field became motivated to use concepts in the field of early childhood education to record an album of music for children. The album was dedicated to Field&#x27;s niece. A song he wrote for the Cockroaches, &quot;Get Ready to Wiggle&quot;, inspired the band&#x27;s name because they thought that wiggling described the way children dance. Like a university assignment, they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album. They needed a keyboardist &quot;to bolster the rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll feel of the project&quot;, so Field asked his old bandmate Fatt for his assistance in what they thought would be a temporary project.

The group received songwriting help from John Field, Anthony&#x27;s brother and former bandmate, and from Phillip Wilcher, who was working with the early childhood music program at Macquarie. After contributing to their first album, hosting the group&#x27;s first recording sessions in his Sydney home, and appearing in a couple of the group&#x27;s first videos, Wilcher left the group and went into classical music. The group reworked a few Cockroaches tunes to better fit the genre of children&#x27;s music; for example, the Cockroaches song &quot;Hot Tamale&quot;, written by John Field, was changed to &quot;Hot Potato&quot;. Anthony Field gave copies of their album to his young students to test out the effect of the group&#x27;s music on children; one mother returned it the next day because her child would not stop listening to it.
To promote their first album, the Wiggles filmed two music videos with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and created a self-produced, forty-minute-long video version. Finances were limited, so there was no post-production editing of the video project. They used Field&#x27;s nieces and nephews as additional cast, and hired the band&#x27;s girlfriends to perform in character costumes. Cook&#x27;s wife made their first costumes. They used two cameras and visually checked the performance of each song; that way, according to Paul Field, it took them less time to complete a forty-minute video than it took other production companies to complete a three-minute music video.

===1991–1993: Early career===
The Cockroaches&#x27; former manager, Jeremy Fabinyi, became the group&#x27;s first manager. Using their previous connections, he negotiated with the ABC to help them promote their first recording. The album cost approximately A$4,000 to produce and it sold 100,000 copies in 1991. Anthony Field and Cook got teaching jobs, while Page finished his degree, so they could only perform during school holidays; finding time to do so was, as Field reported, &quot;challenging&quot;. Fabinyi advised them to tour in unusual settings throughout Sydney and New South Wales. The Wiggles&#x27; debut performance was at a friend&#x27;s daycare facility in Randwick, New South Wales, for about a dozen children. They played for crowds at shopping centres like Westfield in Sydney and at small pre-school events and parties, and busked at Circular Quay, then moved on to regional tours and shows for playgroup associations, averaging about 300 people in the audience. They were promoted by local playgroups or nursing mothers&#x27; associations with whom they split their proceeds. They performed at pre-schools with other ABC children&#x27;s performers; when 500 people attended these concerts just to see the Wiggles, they started doing their own shows, and according to Field, &quot;Suddenly people started rolling up to performances in astonishing numbers&quot;.

In 1993, Field, Cook, and Page decided to give up teaching for a year to focus on performing full-time, along with Fatt, to see if they could make a living out of it. As Fatt reported, &quot;it was very much a cottage industry&quot;. They used many of the business techniques developed by the Cockroaches, choosing to remain as independent and self-contained as possible. John Field, Mike Conway, who later became the Wiggles&#x27; general manager, trumpeter Dominic Lindsay, and Cockroaches saxophonist Daniel Fallon performed with them. Anthony Field, with input from the other members, led most of the production of their music, home video releases, and live shows. Their act was later augmented with supporting characters: the &quot;friendly pirate&quot; Captain Feathersword and the costumed characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog. These characters were initially performed by the band members themselves: Field played Captain Feathersword and Wags; Cook played Dorothy; and Fatt played Henry. In 1993, actor Paul Paddick permanently joined the group to play Captain Feathersword; he later became known as &quot;the fifth Wiggle&quot; and was as popular as the regular bandmembers. At first, the group travelled with a small group of dancers hired from a local dance studio to perform with them.

After the production of their second album, the Wiggles, who were called by their first names when they performed, began to wear costumes on stage as Fabinyi suggested and as the Cockroaches had done, and adopted colour-coded shirts: Page in yellow, Cook in red, Fatt in purple, and Field in blue. The coloured shirts also made it easier for their young audience to identify them. As Field reported, the decision to emphasise colour was &quot;a no-brainer, considering our pre-school-age audience&quot;. Cook and Fatt already owned shirts in their colours, but Field and Page &quot;met in a Sydney department store and literally raced to see who got the blue shirt&quot;.

===1993–2004: Australian and international success===
Through the rest of the 1990s, the Wiggles maintained a busy recording and touring schedule, becoming as Field reported and despite his strong dislike of touring, &quot;the hardest-working touring act in the country&quot;. They released multiple albums and home videos and, depending upon the word of mouth of their audience, performed to increasingly large audiences in Australia and New Zealand despite having to re-introduce themselves to a new audience of children approximately every three years. They produced a new album and video each year and toured to promote them. By late 1993, they &quot;grew bigger than anyone had thought&quot;, and hundreds attended their concerts; by 1995 they had set records for music and video sales. In 1997, Twentieth Century Fox produced a feature-length film, &quot;The Wiggles Movie&quot;, which became the fifth-highest grossing Australian film of 1998, earning over a million-and-a-half dollars.

In spite of their early success in Australia, Paul Field reported that the band was unable to produce a television program on the ABC, where they felt they would receive the most exposure to the pre-school market. &quot;Around 1996–1997&quot;, they filmed a television pilot for the ABC, but as &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported in 2002, &quot;the project never got off the ground due to irreconcilable artistic differences&quot;. As a result, the Wiggles financed a TV program of 13 episodes themselves and sold it to Disney Channel in Australia and to Channel Seven, where it became a hit. By 1998, the Wiggles were ready to move on to international markets, despite its members&#x27; health issues, especially Anthony Field&#x27;s. The reaction of producers in the UK was less positive than the group would have liked, although they were eventually able to make inroads there, but their real success came in the US. Disney arranged for them to perform at Disneyland in California, where they were discovered by Lyrick Studios, the producers of &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;. Both Anthony and Paul Field reported that Lyrick, despite their initial misgivings about whether American audiences would accept the band&#x27;s Australian accents, came to understand the Wiggles and their goals, and after successful tests with American children, enthusiastically promoted them.

The Wiggles used many of the same promotion techniques in the US that they had used in Australia, and chose to keep their concerts simple and maintain the same values that were successful in Australia. The Wiggles performed during the intermission of &quot;Barney Live&quot; stage shows, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; likened to &quot;getting the warm-up slot for the Stones&quot; in the pre-school entertainment world. In 2000, when video sales took off in the US, Lyrick began to distribute Wiggles videos and advertised them by including Wiggles shorts as trailers in their &quot;Barney&quot; videos, which, as Anthony Field stated, &quot;pushed us over the edge&quot;. At first, the group&#x27;s videos were distributed in boutique stores such as FAO Schwarz and Zany Brainy, and on-line. According to Paul Field, they entered the mass media market when their videos became top-sellers at Amazon.com, and their first two videos, &quot;Yummy Yummy&quot; and &quot;Wiggle Time&quot;, landed in the top ten at Amazon.com. Stores such as Wal-Mart began to take notice, and began to sell Wiggles videos. The band released nine DVDs in the next three years to keep up with the demand.

As they had done in Australia, the Wiggles chose to tour, but start off small, with simple props and sets instead of hiring a touring company. Some of their first appearances in America were at Blockbuster Video parking lots in 1999 to small audiences—as Fatt said, &quot;a dozen people&quot;. They performed at small venues such as church halls and 500-seat theatres in Brooklyn and New Jersey, and upgraded to larger venues as ticket sales increased. Anthony Field reported that one week they would perform to 8,000 in Sydney and to 20 people the following week at a parking lot in a small town in the US. One time, they performed for a dozen people at the Mall of America in Minnesota, but half of the audience were hired by Lyrick. Eventually, they moved to larger arenas such as the Beacon Theatre and Madison Square Garden. They performed at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, for six weeks. Their audiences began to increase, and they toured Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, the US, and the UK.

The Wiggles&#x27; popularity in the US increased &quot;in the shell-shocked weeks after the terrorist attacks on New York City in 2001&quot;, when the group performed there, even when other acts cancelled their tours, a decision that earned them loyalty and respect. According to Cook, the press proclaimed that they were braver than many Australian sports teams that had cancelled their appearances. Paul Field stated, &quot;New York has really embraced them. It was a kind of watershed&quot;. Strong sales of the Wiggles videos eventually caught the attention of Disney Channel in the US, who was impressed by their &quot;strong pro-social message&quot;. In January 2002, Disney began showing Wiggles video clips between their programs. By June of that year, the popularity of the clips prompted Disney Channel to add both of the Wiggles&#x27; television series to their schedule and showed full episodes multiple times per day. Anthony Field reported that despite their &quot;modest production values&quot;, the shows were popular with pre-schoolers.

Beginning in 2002, the Wiggles filmed four series worth of television programs exclusively with the ABC. The network called them &quot;the most successful property that the ABC has represented in the pre-school genre&quot;. By the end of 2002, according to Field, &quot;we knew we were involved in something extraordinary in the US&quot;. Their concert schedule in North America doubled, seemingly overnight; they began performing up to 520 shows per year all over the world. They also began to produce other stage shows in places the Wiggles themselves were unable to visit, in Australia, the UK, and US, that featured their characters, a host, and a few dancers. &quot;The Age&quot; called this time period (about the mid-2000s) the group&#x27;s &quot;high point&quot;; they earned A$45 million a year in revenues, and had several licensing deals and an international distribution agreement with Disney.

Despite their success, Anthony Field almost left the group in 2004, shortly after his marriage and the birth of his first child, due to his serious medical issues, which were worsened by the Wiggles&#x27; demanding tour schedule. After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago, Field improved his health to the point that he was able to continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and cast members in every city they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements.

===2005–2006: Page&#x27;s retirement===
In December 2005, lead singer Page, at age 33, underwent a double hernia operation. He withdrew from the Wiggles&#x27; US tour in August 2006, after suffering fainting spells, lethargy, nausea, and loss of balance. He returned to Australia, where doctors diagnosed his condition as orthostatic intolerance, a chronic but not life-threatening condition. Page&#x27;s final performance with the Wiggles was in Kingston, Rhode Island.

On 30 November 2006, the Wiggles announced Page&#x27;s retirement from the group. In a video message posted on the group&#x27;s web page, Page said: &quot;I&#x27;ll miss being a part of the Wiggles very much, but this is the right decision because it will allow me to focus on managing my health&quot;. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; called it &quot;unsettling&quot;. Page was replaced by Sam Moran, who had served as an understudy for the Wiggles for five years and had already stood in for Page for 150 shows. Initially, the Wiggles struggled over their decision to replace Page, but after their audience&#x27;s positive response to Moran, they decided to continue as a group because they thought that was what their young audience would want. According to Fatt, who called it &quot;a huge decision&quot; and &quot;a teachable moment&quot; for them, they chose to be honest with their young audience as they made the transition from Page to Moran. As part owner of the Wiggles, Page received a payout of about $20 million.

===2006–2012: Moran era===

Although Moran&#x27;s transition as the Wiggles&#x27; lead singer was &quot;smooth&quot; for the young children of their audience, it was more difficult for their parents. Moran said that &quot;most children understood&quot;. Field reported that by the group&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2011, due to the ever-changing nature of their audience, most of their young fans were unfamiliar with Page. Cook stated that Moran&#x27;s transition was challenging for the group because replacing their lead singer &quot;changed their sound&quot;. Fatt characterised Moran&#x27;s singing style as more operatic, so they chose different keys to sing and perform. The Wiggles never publicly disclosed how much Moran was paid, but it was reported that he earned $200,000 per year. Moran was featured in his first album and video as a member of the group in early 2007, and a new series of the Wiggles&#x27; television program featuring Moran was filmed and began airing in Australia.

At the end of 2007, the Wiggles donated their complete back catalogue of 27 master tapes to Australia&#x27;s National Film and Sound Archive. Their business ventures during these years included opening up &quot;Wiggles World&quot; sections in theme parks in North America and the Arab World, internet offerings, the creation of new television shows, and a five-year-long partnership with the American television network Sprout in 2009. In December 2010, Cinemalive beamed a Wiggles concert live from Acer Arena into movie theatres all over Australia, for children and their families unable to attend their shows.

In early July 2011, Fatt developed arrhythmia and underwent &quot;urgent but routine&quot; heart surgery, when he was fitted with a pacemaker after feeling unwell for several weeks and blacking out. He missed the group&#x27;s US tour as a result, after not missing a show in 20 years. Also in mid-2011, the Wiggles celebrated their 20th anniversary with circus-themed shows and performances throughout Australia and the outback in a circus tent, as well as a &quot;physically grueling&quot; birthday-themed tour of 90 shows throughout Australia, which Paul Field called &quot;one of the biggest of their careers&quot;. Sydney&#x27;s Powerhouse Museum commemorated the group&#x27;s anniversary with an exhibit that displayed Wiggles memorabilia.

In 2011, the worldwide financial crisis hit the group, and they recorded their first drop in revenues in 10 years, at approximately $2.5 million, a total decrease of 28 percent. Royalties partially offset the difference between their 2010 and 2011 revenues. Their managing director Mike Conway called 2011 their toughest year financially. For the first time, they had negative equity, with more liabilities than assets, and the owners had to provide the funds for them to continue operations. Conway stated that their losses were due to less touring time in the US, difficulties in placing their DVDs in Walmart, and their required investment in a new digital platform.

===2012: Reunion with Page and departure of Cook, Fatt and Page===
In January 2012, and amidst a great deal of controversy, the Wiggles announced that Page had regained his health and was returning to the group in the place of Moran. He returned as an employee &quot;exactly on the same level as [Moran]&quot;, rather than a co-owner, having relinquished his business interest in the group after he left in 2006. According to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, the band members&#x27; interest in Page&#x27;s return was sparked when they reunited during the group&#x27;s induction in the ARIA Hall of Fame in November 2011. It was originally planned for Page to remain with the group temporarily until August 2012. &quot;Business Review Weekly&quot; reported that the presentation of Moran&#x27;s departure had been mishandled and had potentially damaged their brand image. Paul Field agreed, stating that they &quot;could have handled the communication and management of the transition better&quot;. Cook later admitted that they were shocked by the backlash in the press and among the parents of their audience. As part of his severance package, Moran continued to collect song royalties and was granted use of the Wiggles&#x27; studios.

In mid-2012, the Wiggles announced that Cook, Fatt and Page would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of the Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce replaced Cook. Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, staying in the band &quot;was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners&quot;. Cook, Fatt and Page remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group&#x27;s original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.

Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Gillespie, Pryce and Watkins. The new members, like Moran (who was not approached to return), were salaried employees. Watkins had previously worked with the group, first performing character roles in 2010, when Anthony Field approached her to join the main line-up. He had initially asked her to tour with the group after being impressed by a behind-the-scenes video she had filmed. Once she had joined the group, Field asked Watkins to dye her hair red, as well as learn how to play the drums. Gillespie had joined the company performing as part of the live shows in 2009, while Pryce had previously worked as a backing vocalist on some of the band&#x27;s albums.

The group, for their farewell tour, visited eight countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people. Gillespie, Pryce and Watkins wore &quot;in training&quot; T-shirts, and debuted the song &quot;Do the Propeller&quot; during these concerts. The final televised performance of the original band members, along with the new members, was on 22 December 2012, during the annual Carols in the Domain in Sydney. Their final performance, after over 7000 shows over the years, was on 23 December at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Also by 2012, the Wiggles performed to audiences whose parents attended their shows in their early years, and they were hiring performers who were part of their audience as young children.

===2013–2021: &quot;New Wiggles&quot; era===

The new iteration of the Wiggles, with Field and its new members, began touring in early 2013. Cook became the group&#x27;s road manager in mid-2013. Pryce reported that since the Wiggles&#x27; audience changed every few years, the transition to the new group was easier for their young audience than it was for their parents. One of their challenges, especially for their early tours, was learning the Wiggles&#x27; catalogue of 1400 songs. After a seven-year absence from Australian television, they filmed a new television series, called &quot;Ready, Steady, Wiggle!&quot;, in their spare time at their studio in Sydney between tours and on the road. Watkins, who had a film-making degree, played an important role in its production. Field admitted that they found it &quot;hard going&quot; until they returned to television. Merchandise featuring the original group outsold the new group&#x27;s products, and they failed to sell-out their concerts. By 2014, however, the Wiggles found success with their new line-up, when they doubled their concert ticket sales from the year before, and won the 2014 ARIA Award for Best Children&#x27;s Album with &quot;Apples &amp; Bananas&quot;. In 2015, Paul Field called the new group &quot;an amazing success&quot;. According to Kathy McCabe of News Corp Australia, it took 18 months for the new group to be accepted by their audience. In 2014, it was announced that the Wiggles would produce their second feature film; comedian Ben Elton was slated to write the script and co-write the soundtrack.
McCabe credited their success to Watkins, who became the group&#x27;s stand-out member. According to Field, an American journalist called her young fans, who came to concerts dressed in yellow and wearing bows like her, the &quot;mini Emma army&quot;. She was so popular that a new television series, &quot;Emma!&quot;, featuring Watkins as a solo performer, was produced in 2015. Anthony Field compared Watkins to Elvis Presley, while Paul Field called her &quot;an aspirational role model&quot; for their young audience and reported that she had increased their fan base of girls. Up to 80% of the audience at concerts would emulate her costuming and wear yellow; by 2021 it was estimated that 50% of the group&#x27;s merchandising was specific to the &quot;Emma&quot; brand. In early 2015, Gillespie and Watkins revealed that they had been dating for two years; they announced their engagement in May 2015. They were married in April 2016, but made public their separation in August 2018.

At first, the members of the new group were salaried employees, but in 2020, Peter Ker of &quot;The Australian Financial Review&quot; reported that Watkins and Gillespie had each acquired approximately 8% of the company and were given directorships in June 2018; Pryce was the only member who did not have equity in the business. Ker also reported that Anthony Field owned 36%, while Fatt and Cook each owned 24% of the business. A new costumed character, Shirley Shawn the Unicorn, was added in 2019, who was later revealed to identify as non-binary. The COVID-19 pandemic halted the group&#x27;s capacity to tour in 2020, which led to a downsizing of the company&#x27;s staff and an increase in filming online content.

Throughout the new members era, the original line-up engaged in occasional reunion performances. In February 2016, the original group members performed a charity concert for an over-18 audience at the Dee Why RSL club in Sydney. The original line-up performed reunion charity concerts on 17 and 18 January 2020 to raise funds for the Australian bush fires with proceeds going to the Australian Red Cross and the WIRES Wildlife Rescue Service. Onstage on 17 January, Page suffered a cardiac arrest; he stopped breathing and required CPR and three jolts from a defibrillator. Page was discharged from hospital the following week. In March 2021, the Wiggles performed on Triple J&#x27;s &quot;Like a Version&quot; segment. Cook and Fatt returned alongside Field, Gillespie, Pryce and Watkins to cover Tame Impala&#x27;s &quot;Elephant&quot; which they interspersed with &quot;Fruit Salad&quot;; the cover reached 1 on the annual Triple J Hottest 100 poll for 2021. This was the first cover to top the chart, as well as the first time a children&#x27;s act had led the ranking.

===2021–present: Expanded line-up===

The Wiggles commemorated their 30th anniversary in January 2021 with a song entitled &quot;We&#x27;re All Fruit Salad!&quot;, containing lyrics centred around unity and acceptance, and featuring guest performers of different cultural backgrounds, after Field expressed a desire to include more diversity in the band. In August 2021, four new members were added to the Wiggles, with the aim of embracing cultural and gender diversity, and better reflecting contemporary society. Evie Ferris, Kelly Hamilton, Tsehay Hawkins and John Pearce debuted in an exclusive web series entitled &quot;Fruit Salad TV&quot;, made available on YouTube in September.

Watkins announced her departure from the group in October 2021 and was replaced by Hawkins in the primary line-up; she became the band&#x27;s first woman of colour. The expanded line-up made their live performance debut as the pre-match entertainment of an Australia women&#x27;s national soccer team game in November, followed by a national Australian concert tour in early 2022. Caterina Mete, the long-standing choreographer for the Wiggles, joined the group at the commencement of the tour. Field&#x27;s daughter, Lucia Field, debuted as a member in July 2022, wearing blue like her father; by this point, the group had transitioned to an equal eight-piece line-up. The group made their first appearance on the cover of the Australian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in September, before making history as the first band in Australia to perform two arena tours in one year. A new instalment of the &quot;Ready, Steady, Wiggle!&quot; television series, the first to feature the expanded line-up, premiered in March 2023; additional series premiered in 2023 and 2024. &quot;Wiggle and Learn&quot;, a new web educational series titled, was first made available on YouTube in February 2024, with further episodes released every two weeks throughout the year. A corresponding album, &quot;Wiggle and Learn: 100 Educational Songs for Children&quot;, will be released in August 2024 as the group&#x27;s 100th album release.

The original line-up continued to perform occasionally during this period. Cook, Fatt, Anthony Field and Page performed an adults-only reunion tour at arenas around Australia in early 2022. They also made contributions to the 2022 tribute album &quot;ReWiggled&quot;, which debuted at 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart and became the group&#x27;s first number-one album in Australia. &quot;ReWiggled&quot; was named Best Children&#x27;s Album at the 2022 ARIA Awards, where the Wiggles were presented with the award for Best Australian Live Act, for their dual tour featuring the group&#x27;s regular and original members. Members of the original group (minus Cook) were brought on stage by the Kid Laroi for a three-song cameo during his Melbourne concert in June 2022. The original quartet also performed at Falls Festival across Australia in late 2022 and early 2023. A documentary detailing the group&#x27;s history, entitled &quot;Hot Potato: The Story of The Wiggles&quot;, premiered in October 2023 on Amazon Prime Video.

==Musical style==
The Wiggles have written new music each year since their inception; they sequestered themselves for a month each summer and wrote three albums&#x27; worth of original children&#x27;s music based on simple concepts familiar to young children, and using several genres of music and types of instruments. Most of their songs were short and started with the chorus because they felt that young children needed to be presented with a song&#x27;s topic in their first few lines. They wrote songs individually at first, but eventually wrote as a group, often with John Field, trumpet player Dominic Lindsay, and Paddick. Fatt, the only member of the original group without a degree in early childhood education, tended to focus on composing music. Fatt told reporter Brian McElhiney, who called the group&#x27;s songwriting process &quot;a collaborate affair&quot;, that they wrote repetitive pop songs or jingles, which were appealing to children. Watkins reported that she was invited to write songs for their albums, even though she was primarily a dancer. John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival, who appeared in a Wiggles video in 2002, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he was &quot;very impressed&quot; with the group&#x27;s songwriting, especially with their drum sound.

According to Anthony Field, the transition from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children&#x27;s music was not a big one for the Wiggles. He explained that the music of the Cockroaches and the Wiggles was similar, but just featuring different subject matter in the lyrics. Moran stated that the Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. They approached simple and relocatable topics, such as food and nutrition, as teachers would in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. The group sang the same 60s-style pop as the Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless. The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. Page reported, &quot;First and foremost, we&#x27;re entertainers&quot;. The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.

The group wrote and performed children&#x27;s music that was different from what had been done previously; as Cook stated, &quot;we didn&#x27;t just go down the route of what people think is kids&#x27; music&quot;. They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group were aware that their songs were often children&#x27;s first exposure to music. &quot;Guitar Magazine&quot; speculated that since Cook was one of the first guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world. Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see and appreciated the opportunity to inspire children to learn to play guitar later. In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like Regular John approached him and said that the Wiggles were the first band &quot;they got into&quot;.

==Educational theory==
The Wiggles&#x27; songwriting and performances were rooted in their professional training as pre-school teachers and in the concepts of early childhood education. Field reported, as he studied music for young children at university, being &quot;shocked ... at the non-inclusive way music for children was usually performed&quot;. According to Field, children had to sit silently as musicians played &quot;traditional songs often featuring negative or outdated lyrics and dealing with subject matter of no interest to small children&quot;. The lack of songs with themes and topics that interested children inspired Field to record the Wiggles&#x27; first album.

The group&#x27;s &quot;golden rule&quot;, according to Field, was to make the content of their songs and shows &quot;developmentally appropriate and fun&quot;. Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements&quot;. They also respected their audience&#x27;s intelligence and insight about entertainment, information and honesty. As Field said, &quot;Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive&quot;. The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.
The Wiggles&#x27; stage shows are full of action and audience participation. By the group&#x27;s &quot;New Wiggles&quot; iteration, they featured inside jokes for the adult members of their audience and the bandmembers tended to wander throughout the audience. Pryce, as an experienced stage performer, was conscious that their shows were the first live theatre young children experienced; as a result, the group adapted the content of their shows to accommodate their audience&#x27;s development and understanding. Paddick&#x27;s role as Captain Feathersword became more important in the mid-1990s, especially in the group&#x27;s stage shows, when he was able to incorporate his circus and opera training, as well as impersonations that were popular with their audience&#x27;s parents.

They believed in empowering children by practices such as greeting their audience members with &quot;Hello, everyone&quot;, instead of &quot;Hello, boys and girls&quot; which, as Paul Field explains, &quot;unnecessarily separates children and has undertones of condescension&quot;. Kathleen Warren, the band members&#x27; former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group&#x27;s practice of asking their audience to &quot;Wake Up Jeff&quot; when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was &quot;very much in keeping with the way they work with children&quot;. Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt&#x27;s slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in control of their lives. Fatt was the only original member of the Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that &quot;it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything&quot;. Paul Field reported that children in the Wiggles&#x27; audience felt &quot;great excitement&quot; and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way. Anthony Field, who called it &quot;a simple audience participation and interaction gag we&#x27;ve done since the start of the group&quot;, claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences. The group&#x27;s members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group, but it became Fatt&#x27;s gimmick because &quot;it was a perfect fit&quot;. When Fatt retired, Gillespie took over the task of falling asleep.

Simple movements were developed by their choreographers, including Leeanne Ashley, to accompany each song because, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, they believed &quot;in the power of basic movements to enchant young children&quot;. According to reporter Anders Wright, they intentionally made mistakes in their dance moves in order to identify more with their young audience. The group incorporated more dancing into their performances after the birth of Field&#x27;s oldest daughter in 2004. In later years, corresponding with Field&#x27;s developing interests in acrobatics and gymnastics, they added these elements to their stage shows, including, as Field reported, hiring several world-class athletes such as former trampoline champion Karl Shore. Watkins, whom Paul Field called &quot;a dancer of many disciplines&quot;, was initially hired as a member of their troupe and referred to herself as &quot;mainly a dancer&quot;.

Between 1999 and 2003, to test the group&#x27;s appeal across cultures, Warren used one of the Wiggles&#x27; CDs as an educational tool in a village near Madang, on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. She found that the Madangese children were able to relate to the group&#x27;s songs, and that they were able to sing along and participate in their simple choreography. Although the Wiggles&#x27; recorded and performed songs, dances, and musical styles from different cultures and languages, the Wiggles did not find that adapting their music to non-Australian cultures was necessary to reach children in other countries. The Wiggles recognised that as long as they spoke at the same level as their audience, their Australian accents would not matter, and that young children were able to adapt to a variety of contexts and to different pronunciations of common words, no matter where they resided.

==Brand and finances==

Throughout the group&#x27;s history, the members and management have retained full creative control and ownership of every aspect of their business in an effort to remain as independent as possible. As Field stated, the band&#x27;s corporation was &quot;not your regular &#x27;corporate culture&#x27;. The group does not have a chief executive, instead making decisions through consensus and made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education. Endorsements of toys and other products are made carefully and only with products that correlated with their image. There are high expectations regarding the behaviour and attitude of everyone associated with the group, although in 2021, Watkins denied the existence of &quot;a Wiggles code-of-conduct manual hidden away somewhere&quot;. Other ventures of band&#x27;s corporation included franchising their concept to Africa, South America, and Taiwan. The group also licensed &quot;Wiggles World&quot; sections to various theme parks in the United States and Australia, as well as play centres in both regions.

The Wiggles became formally consolidated in 2005. The group&#x27;s board of directors consisted of the original three members, as well as Paul Field, who had been the manager of the group since the mid-1990s, and Mike Conway, who had worked for Ernst &amp; Young in England and became a co-manager in 2001. It was reported that as part owner of the Wiggles, Page was given a A$20 million payout when he left the group in 2006; he officially ceased to be a company shareholder in 2008. After their retirement in 2012, Cook and Fatt, as well as Anthony Field, each retained 30% ownership of the brand, and Paul Field and Conway each owned 5%. Gillespie, Pryce and Watkins were reported to be salaried employees when they joined the group in 2012. Paul Field departed as the company&#x27;s general manager in March 2020, in the midst of a period of &quot;organisational change&quot;. It was reported through corporate filings that Watkins and Gillespie each acquired approximately 8% ownership of the business as well as company directorships in June 2018, while Pryce had not gained equity of the group. At the time of reporting, it was suggested that Anthony Field owned 36% of the brand, becoming the majority shareholder, while Fatt and Cook each owned 24%. By 2021, it was estimated that the group earned A$30 million per year.
Luke O&#x27;Neill was appointed as the brand&#x27;s first CEO in January 2024. 

==Reception==
The Wiggles have enjoyed &quot;almost universal approval&quot; throughout their history. Their songs have been sung and played in pre-schools around the world. Between 2000 and 2010, the Wiggles earned 21 Gold records. The group&#x27;s albums have been certified by ARIA as double Platinum, Platinum and Gold in Australia, as well as certified Gold in the US. The original group performed, on average, to one million people per year. The Wiggles&#x27; music has also received over one billion streams on digital services. In 2014, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; called their shows slick and fast-paced.

After 2003, front-row tickets to their sold-out concerts in the US were scalped for US$500. The group responded by reducing the number of seats sold per transaction, in order to keep prices down and avoid further tickets scalping. In 2008, the group found themselves in the midst of what &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called a &quot;ticketing scandal&quot;; scalpers tried to sell an A$19 ticket on eBay for almost A$2,000 and a set of three tickets for A$315 for concerts in Melbourne, and a group of three tickets to a Wiggles UNICEF charity concert in Sydney had a price tag of A$510. The tickets were taken off eBay and voided.

In what Paul Field called &quot;one of the highlights of their 15 years of being together&quot;, The Wiggles were awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Australian Catholic University in 2006. Cook gave an address during the private ceremony honouring them. They were awarded another honorary doctoral degree in 2009 from their alma mater, Macquarie University. The group were named UNICEF goodwill ambassadors in 2008; they held a special concert to raise money for the organisation. In 2010, the four original members of the Wiggles were appointed Members of the Order of Australia for their service to the arts in Australia, especially children&#x27;s entertainment, and for their contributions and support of several charities. They called the honour their &quot;biggest recognition yet&quot;. The group has always invited children with special needs and their families to pre-concert &quot;meet and greet&quot; sessions. According to Fatt, many parents of these children have reported that the Wiggles&#x27; music has enhanced their lives, and that children with autism &quot;respond to [the] Wiggles and nothing else&quot;. The Wiggles, throughout their history, have visited and performed for patients at the Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital every Christmas morning.

===Controversies===
In 2020, a song released six years earlier titled &quot;Pappadum&quot; received significant backlash for its portrayal of Indian culture. The song&#x27;s lyrics are the word pappadum repeated over and over again, and the accompanying music video sees the Wiggles dancing in traditional Indian style whilst wearing sarees, dhotis and waving pappadums about. Member Anthony Field, who wrote the song, issued an apology stating that he wrote it as a celebration of Indian culture. The song has since been removed from live concerts.

In 2021, Australian senator Matt Canavan of the National Party accused the Wiggles of going &quot;woke&quot;, following the group&#x27;s introduction of several new ethnically diverse members. Canavan stated that &quot;the Wiggles are free to do what they like. It was nice while it lasted. But you go woke, you go broke&quot;. His comments were largely criticised by fans welcoming the changes.

In 2023, the Australian city of Bunbury, Western Australia used a loop of the song &quot;Hot Potato&quot; to deter homeless people from setting up shelter at a popular spot, which caused a lot of outrage among locals. The Wiggles released a statement, saying that this use of their music went against their message of bringing joy and happiness to people. After the band approached the city, the music has since been switched off.

<text>The Parliament of the Republic of South Africa is South Africa&#x27;s legislature. It is located in Cape Town, the country&#x27;s legislative capital. 

Under the present Constitution of South Africa, the bicameral Parliament comprises a National Assembly and a National Council of Provinces. The current twenty-eighth Parliament was first convened on 14 June 2024.

From 1910 to 1994, members of Parliament were elected chiefly by the South African white minority. The first elections with universal suffrage were held in 1994.

Both chambers held their meetings in the Houses of Parliament, Cape Town that were built 1875–1884. A fire broke out within the buildings in early January 2022, destroying the session room of the National Assembly. It was decided that the National Assembly would temporarily meet at the Good Hope Chamber.

==History==

===Before 1910===

The predecessor of the Parliament of South Africa, before the 1910 Union of South Africa, was the bicameral Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope. This was composed of the House of Assembly (the lower house) and the Legislative Council (the upper house). It dated back to the beginnings of Cape independence in 1853 and was elected according to the multi-racial Cape Qualified Franchise system, whereby suffrage qualifications were applied equally to all males, regardless of race.

The buildings of the Cape Parliament went on to house the Parliament of South Africa, after union.

===1910–1961===

When the Union of South Africa was established in 1910, the Parliament was bicameral and consisted of the King or the Queen, the Senate, and the House of Assembly (known in Afrikaans as the &quot;Volksraad&quot;).
* The King (from 1952, the Queen of South Africa) was represented by the Governor-General.
* The Senate consisted of senators nominated by the four provinces, and by the Governor-General, initially for a period of ten years. The number of senators was changed from time to time. The Senate was chaired by a President of the Senate chosen by the senators from among themselves.
* The House of Assembly consisted of members who were directly elected by the voters. Each MP represented an electoral district (constituency), and most of them were elected on the basis of their political party. The number of constituencies and parliamentary seats was increased from time to time, in line with increases in the population. The House was chaired by a Speaker chosen by the MPs from among themselves.
* Only white men could be senators or MPs.
* The franchise (right to vote) was originally granted to white men in all four provinces, to black men in the Cape Province and Natal, and to Coloured men in the Cape Province – in all cases, the minimum age was 21 years.

The composition of Parliament was changed by constitutional amendments from time to time:
* From 1930, white women had the vote, and the right to serve as senators and MPs, on the same basis as white men.
* In 1934, Parliament was declared &quot;the sovereign legislative power in and over the Union&quot;.
* From 1937, black voters were separated from the other races – in the Senate they were represented by four elected senators (two for the Cape, one for Natal, one for the Orange Free State and Transvaal), and in the House of Assembly by three &quot;native representative&quot; MPs elected in separate black constituencies.
* From 1950, white voters in South West Africa, which was under South African administration at that time, were represented by four senators and six MPs.
* From 1957, Coloured voters were separated from the whites – in the Senate, they were represented by separate senators, and in the House of Assembly by MPs elected in separate Coloured constituencies. To pass this amendment in the face of strong opposition (and two Supreme Court rulings), prime minister Johannes Strijdom had to enlarge the Senate and appoint enough pro-government senators to get the two-thirds majority he needed to force through the constitutional change.
* Representation of black voters was ended in 1960.
* Voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1960.

In a referendum held in 1960, a small majority of white voters approved the conversion of the country from a constitutional monarchy to a parliamentary republic.

The Republic of South Africa was established in 1961. The only change made to the composition of the Parliament was the substitution of the State President for the Queen. A few significant changes were made later:
* Coloured representation was ended in 1968, leaving both the Senate and the House of Assembly representing white voters only.
* South West Africa ceased to be represented in Parliament from 1977, following the passing of the South West Africa Constitution Amendment Act of that year.
* The Senate was abolished with effect from 1 January 1981, changing Parliament to a unicameral legislature.

===1984–1994===
A new Constitution, introduced in 1984, re-enfranchised the Coloured population (women as well as men) and enfranchised the Indian population. It retained the existing House of Assembly for whites and established a House of Representatives to represent the Coloureds, and a House of Delegates for the Indians, making Parliament a tricameral legislature. Blacks continued to be excluded.
* Each house consisted of members elected to represent constituencies, plus a few additional members elected by the MPs, and some nominated by the State President.
* Each house legislated on &quot;own affairs&quot; exclusive to its own race group, and they legislated jointly on &quot;general affairs&quot; affecting all races. In practice, the House of Assembly, which had more MPs than the other two houses combined, continued to dominate the legislature.
* Each house was chaired by a chairman elected by its members from among themselves. They were coordinated by a Speaker of Parliament, elected by the members of all three houses in a joint sitting.
* The existing House of Assembly, elected in 1981, was deemed to have been re-elected in 1984, to coordinate its term of office with those of the two new houses. However, this was later overturned by the Supreme Court, and a separate election had to be held for the House of Assembly in 1987. The House elected in 1987 was then dissolved with the other houses in 1989.

The black majority were still disfranchised, and the new system lacked legitimacy even among the Coloureds and Asians, many of whom boycotted elections. In a referendum held in 1992, 68.73% of (only white) voters approved the reform process that effectively ended Apartheid. In late 1993, one of the last pieces of legislation passed by the tricameral Parliament was the Interim Constitution, which took effect on 27 April 1994, the same day as the first non-racial elections.

===Since 1994===

A new interim constitution, introduced in 1994 after four years of negotiation, finally introduced all-race democracy and enfranchised men and women of all races on equal terms, the minimum age remaining 18 years. Parliament was reconstituted to consist of a Senate and a National Assembly. 
* The Senate consisted of 90 senators, ten nominated by each of the nine provinces. It was chaired by a President of the Senate elected by the senators from among themselves.
*The National Assembly consists of 400 members, elected by voters on a proportional representation/party list system. There are no electoral districts, and each party is allocated a number of seats proportionate to the percentage of the votes it receives across the country. It is chaired by a Speaker elected by the MPs from among themselves.
* In 1997, the current Constitution of South Africa came into force, in which the Senate was replaced by a 90-member National Council of Provinces (NCOP), made up of a 10-member delegation from each province (six delegates elected by the provincial legislature, the Premier and three other members of the provincial legislature). The NCOP is chaired by a Chairperson elected by the members from among themselves.

The parliamentary system uses proportional representation, with voters voting for political parties rather than for candidates. Proportional representation allows for smaller parties to have a chance of acquiring seats in parliament, although these parties often combine in order to have a stronger voice within the political system, especially against the ANC. The Independent Electoral Commission is charged with keeping elections fair, regular, and equal. Parties submit closed lists of candidates to the IEC, and the IEC fills the seats allotted to individual parties using the candidate lists after election results come in. The electoral system has seen little corruption since 1994.

International Relations Minister and Cooperation Naledi Pandor has noted that during her term (starting 1994) a decline in political respectability had occurred in parliament, due to its members not engaging with one another in a courteous manner. She remarked that she felt undignified to be an observer of the crude behaviour, which also inhibited the conduct of successful politics.

====2022 fire====
On 2 January 2022, large parts of the Old Assembly Building and National Assembly building were damaged in a fire. A man was arrested and subsequently charged with arson.

==Major political parties in parliament==
African National Congress: The ANC was founded in 1912, but were banned by State President Charles Robberts Swart in 1960, remaining so until the ban was lifted thirty years later by President F. W. De Klerk. The ANC became the leading political party in South Africa after the first multi-racial election in 1994. The party&#x27;s main platform rests on working towards racial equality and eradicating the socio-economic classes which are often based on race. The ANC has been considered a party for native South Africans, especially before 2009 when party leader Jacob Zuma faced multiple accusations regarding corruption, particularly using public funds for his own purposes. The economic difficulties in South Africa, as well as police brutality have both been blamed on the ANC. Currently, the ANC holds 230 seats in parliament. Support for the ANC went down between the 2014 and the 2019 general elections, with violent protests erupting all over the country in response to the allegations of corruption within the ANC and the non-delivery of municipal services.

Democratic Alliance: The DA was formed when the New National Party, the successor to the apartheid-era National Party, merged with the Democratic Party and the Federal Alliance in 2000 to form an alliance. The DA is an opposition party and has been traditionally supported by South Africa&#x27;s minority communities (White, Coloured and Indian). In more recent years, the party has attempted to win votes from Black South Africans and as a result, Black support for the DA has risen over the past several years, going from 1% to 6%. The DA is a liberal party that favours free-market policies. The DA was allotted 89 seats in parliament after the 2014 general election, but the party&#x27;s seat total decreased to 84 seats following the 2019 general election.

Economic Freedom Fighters: The EFF emerged eight months before the 2014 general election and won 25 seats in parliament. After the 2019 general elections, the EFF increased their seats in parliament to 44, the only party of the top three parties that achieved an increase of members in parliament. The EFF is a far-left revolutionary socialist political party, advocating for land expropriation and for an end to corruption within parliament.

Inkatha Freedom Party: The IFP, which was formed in 1990 was the successor to the former government in the now-defunct Kwazulu Bantustan, traditionally draws its support from the Zulu people. It has however made inroads into the minority electorate of Whites and Indians. The IFP was the third-largest party until it was unseated by the EFF and is one of the few parties to have consecutive representation in parliament since democracy in 1994. The IFP apart from the ANC was part of the National Government for 10 years. The IFP champions the rights of traditional leaders and advocates for policies which favour free markets. The party is opposed to socialism and communist policies.

Because the ANC had such a large majority in parliament, smaller parties are constantly forming alliances and coalitions in order to act as a stronger opposition to the ANC-run legislative and executive branches.

However, in the 2024 South African general election, support for the ruling African National Congress (ANC) significantly declined; the ANC remained the largest party but lost the parliamentary majority that it had held since the inaugural post-apartheid election in 1994. The centrist Democratic Alliance (DA) remained in second place with a slight increase. uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), a left-wing populist party founded 6 months prior to the election and led by former president Jacob Zuma, came in third place. Most of the ANC&#x27;s loss of support flowed into the MK, while the DA saw some gains, and the EFF lost some support.

==Seat of Parliament==

Parliament sits at the Houses of Parliament, Cape Town, even though the seat of government is in Pretoria. This dates back to the foundation of the Union, when there was disagreement among the four provinces as to which city would be the national capital. As a compromise, Cape Town was designated the &quot;legislative&quot; capital, Bloemfontein the &quot;judicial&quot; capital, and Pretoria the &quot;administrative&quot; capital. The African National Congress (ANC) government has proposed moving Parliament to Pretoria, arguing that the present arrangement is cumbersome as ministers, civil servants and diplomats must move back and forth when Parliament is in session.

However, many Capetonians have spoken out against such a move, accusing the ANC of trying to centralise power. Under the Constitution, there is provision for Parliament to sit elsewhere than Cape Town on grounds of public interest, security or convenience and Parliament is permitted to provide in its rules and orders for sittings outside Cape Town. Rule 24 of the National Assembly Rules accordingly allows the Speaker to direct that the House will sit at &#x27;a place other than the Houses of Parliament in Cape Town&#x27; after consulting the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip of each party represented in the House. Rule 23 of the rules of the National Council of Provinces allows the council to pass a resolution providing for it to sit elsewhere.

In 2018, the Government of South Africa formed a project steering committee to conduct a feasibility study into moving parliament to Pretoria and to identify potential sites for a new parliament building. In April 2019, the Minister of Public Works announced that a list of potential sites had been drawn up. In 2020, it was suggested that moving parliament to Pretoria would save R650 million per year.

In January 2022, a fire broke out at the Houses of Parliament building in Cape Town causing severe damage to the session rooms of both the National Council of Provinces and the National Assembly. The 2022 State of the Nation Address was held at Cape Town City Hall and subsequent meetings of the National Assembly will be held at Good Hope Chamber. The temporary debating chamber has previously been used for committee meetings of the National Assembly and has a seating capacity of 170, reduced to 70 during COVID-19 precautions. The National Assembly has 400 members.

<text>The Outland Trophy is awarded to the best college football interior lineman in the United States as adjudged by the Football Writers Association of America. It is named after John H. Outland. One of only a few players ever to be named an All-American at two positions, Outland garnered consensus All-America honors in 1898 as a tackle and consensus honors as a halfback in 1899. Outland had always contended that football tackles and guards deserved greater recognition and conceived the Outland Trophy as a means of providing this recognition. In 1988, Jimmy Ridlon was commissioned to design and sculpt the Outland Trophy. A member of the National College Football Awards Association, the award has become one of college football&#x27;s most prestigious.

<doc id="376185" wikidata="Q6376050" url="?curid=376185" title="Kath &amp; Kim">
<text>Kath &amp; Kim (also written as Kath and Kim) is an Australian sitcom originally airing in the prime-time slot on ABC Television from 2002 and 2005 and subsequently on the Seven Network in 2007 and 2022. The show was produced by Riley and Turner Productions, the firm of Jane Turner and Gina Riley, who star as the titular characters of Kath Day-Knight, a cheery, middle-aged suburban mother, and Kim, her narcissistic daughter. Additional cast members include Glenn Robbins as Kel Knight, Kath&#x27;s metrosexual boyfriend (later husband); Kim&#x27;s henpecked husband Brett Craig (Peter Rowsthorn), and her lonely &quot;second-best friend&quot; Magda Szubanski as Sharon Strzelecki. The series is set in Fountain Lakes, a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The series received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised the humor and cast performances, particularly of Turner and Riley.

Aside from the television series which comprises four seasons, the franchise also includes a television film, &quot;Da Kath &amp; Kim Code&quot; (2005), and a feature film, &quot;Kath &amp; Kimderella&quot; (2012). The series also spawned a short-lived American remake, which ran for 17 episodes between 2008 and 2009.

A two-part special to mark its 20th anniversary, titled &quot;Kath &amp; Kim: Our Effluent Life&quot; and &quot;Kath and Kim: 20 Preposterous Years&quot;, was screened on 20–21 November 2022.

==Premise==
&quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; follows the day-to-day Australian suburban life of Kath Day-Knight (Jane Turner), her only child Kimberly (Kim) Diane Craig née Day (Gina Riley), Kim&#x27;s husband and Computa City salesman, Brett Craig (Peter Rowsthorn), Kath&#x27;s love interest and eventual husband who works as a &quot;purveyor of fine meats&quot;, Kel Knight (Glenn Robbins), and long-time family friend Sharon Strzelecki (Magda Szubanski).

Storylines follow the characters&#x27; day-to-day lives, and document their personal struggles and the banality of their achievements and aspirations. &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; satirises the mother-daughter relationship and the habits and values of modern suburban Australians, and emphasises the kitsch and superficial elements of contemporary society, particularly the traditional working class which has progressed to a level of affluence (or &quot;effluence&quot; as the show&#x27;s title characters would have it) which previous generations had been unable to achieve. Despite this affluence, good taste and a sense of cultural sophistication still eludes the show&#x27;s characters.

They visit places such as the Westfield Fountain Gate (some parts filmed at Westfield Southland), the local IKEA, Target and various local restaurants.

It also occasionally mocks Australian and international mass popular culture, such as popular reality television shows &quot;Big Brother&quot; and &quot;Australian Idol&quot;. It sometimes makes statements about Australian politics. The crass and embarrassing behaviour of the characters, and their gaudy, out-dated retro fashion sense are popular features of the show. Processed and widely recognised Australian foods, such as Jatz crackers, Tim Tams and Fruche yoghurt are frequently referenced in the series.

Most episodes end with Kath and Kim sitting in Kath&#x27;s back yard, chatting about issues related to the episode. Sometimes these chats help to complete the story which was told during the episode. This final element is accompanied by the show&#x27;s credits.

===Guest cast===
Several guest stars are well-known Australian comedy performers, some of whom previously worked with Turner or Riley. Bublé and Lucas were fans of the show and asked to appear in it. Humphries declared himself a fan of the series before taking part.

==Episodes==

===Overview===
The storyline of the first series follows Kath&#x27;s engagement and plans for her wedding to Kel. Kim frequently stays in her mother&#x27;s house owing to her rocky relationship with Brett (most of which is due to her own childish, spoilt, and rude behaviour towards Brett). Sharon&#x27;s always around with a helping hand and her own relationship problems. Her history with Brett is also explored.

The second series follows Kim&#x27;s pregnancy and her rekindled relationship with Brett. Kath and Kel&#x27;s relationship goes through some teething troubles. Kim and Brett have a baby in the final episode of the second series whom they name Epponnee Raelene Kathleen Darlene Charlene Craig, shortened to Epponnee Rae. Several episodes of the third series focus on Epponnee Rae. The third-season finale features an adult Epponnee Rae, played by Kylie Minogue.

==Production==
===Development===
The characters of Kath, Kim (created by Riley and Turner) and Sharon (created and played by Magda Szubanski) first featured in their current forms during the mid-1990s as a weekly segment of the Australian comedy series &quot;Big Girl&#x27;s Blouse&quot; (Seven, 1994–95), having appeared in a more embryonic incarnation earlier in the decade on the sketch comedy show &quot;Fast Forward&quot; (Seven, 1989–92). They also appeared in &quot;Something Stupid&quot; (Seven, 1998). Robbins had also appeared on &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, while Rowsthorn and Robbins had previously worked together on &quot;The Comedy Company&quot;.

The skits were developed by Riley and Turner into a full series. &quot;Big Girl&#x27;s Blouse&quot; had been deemed a failure by the ABC head of comedy Geoff Portman who wanted to pull &quot;Kath and Kim&quot;. But it was championed by Sandra Levy the ABC Head of Television so &quot;Kath and Kim&quot; had the distinction for a comedy show of being produced by the drama department, and was loved by a very broad audience, including the &quot;suburban people&quot; it parodied.

The name of the series &quot;Kath and Kim&quot; is a pun of the idiom which is an old fashioned idiom for &#x27;friends and family&#x27;.

Twenty-four episodes lasting approximately twenty-five minutes each across three seasons aired on ABC TV from 2002 to 2004. The series debuted on 15 May 2002 on the ABC Network with &quot;Sex&quot; and became one of the highest-rated shows for ABC. A replacement of a full series occurred in 2005 with the telemovie &quot;Da Kath &amp; Kim Code&quot;. The fourth season of &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; began airing on the Seven Network on 19 August 2007, due to the contract expiring with ABC.

In late 2009, they announced that writing had begun on season 5, but by May 2010, Turner said: &quot;We sort of felt like it was the end two years ago. We thought, &#x27;We&#x27;ve done enough and the well is dry and we can&#x27;t think of any more ideas&#x27; ... We think we might just leave it for now.&quot;

===Writing===
The alternative vocabulary including the mixed metaphors, hypercorrection, malapropisms, eggcorns (like &quot;ravishing&quot; instead of &quot;ravenous&quot;), and mis-pronunciations of the regular characters are much repeated by the show&#x27;s fans. These include: &quot;Look at moy&quot; (look at me)—used by Kath to command attention during arguments, and &quot;It&#x27;s noice, different and unusual&quot;—used by Kath, Kim and Sharon to express approval or agreement.

===Filming===
Kath&#x27;s home, known as &quot;Chateau Kath&quot;, was within the fictionalised suburb of Fountain Lakes, and served as the central filming location for the series. The home, located in Patterson Lakes, Victoria, 35 km east of Melbourne, was originally rented by ABC during the entire run of the series, and chosen for its likeness to Sylvania Waters. The property backs onto a canal, which ABC fenced off during filming in order for it to look more suburban. It was sold in 2016 for $1,485,000. The house was demolished in July 2022.

Other footage was filmed around the Melbourne suburbs of Cheltenham and Moorabbin; scenes set at Fountain Gate were actually filmed at Westfield Southland.

===Costuming===
Second-hand shops were used for Kath&#x27;s clothing, whereas Kim was dressed in current trends.

===Theme music and opening titles===
The theme music for &quot;Kath and Kim&quot; is performed by Gina Riley and is a cover of Anthony Newley&#x27;s &quot;The Joker&quot;, performed in the style of Shirley Bassey&#x27;s recording of the song. A reworked recording of its debut in the telemovie opening sequence, was utilised for the show&#x27;s run on the Seven Network.

The title sequence shows the main five regular characters over a white background. In season 3, it was amended to include Epponnee-Rae and Cujo, before switching to a revised version of the previous sequence for the Seven Network run, where Cujo was retained. The five regular cast members are then credited over aerial shots of suburban houses (Szubanski is credited as a &quot;special guest&quot; despite appearing in every episode) before fading into an aerial shot of Kath and Kim&#x27;s house (some episodes replace it with an aerial shot of the mall, while the episode &quot;The Wedding&quot; replaced it with a ground-level shot of a hospital).

==Broadcast==
&quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; was broadcast Thursday nights at 8.30 pm throughout its run on ABC, while Seven Network aired the series Sunday nights at 7.30 pm.

The series premiered in the United Kingdom in April 2004, when it was broadcast on the now-defunct subscription channel LivingTV, and later on Ftn. It made its terrestrial television debut when it screened on BBC Two from 12 May 2005. The fourth season has never been broadcast in the UK, but did premiere when it was made available on Netflix.

In 2017, the rights to the series were acquired by the Nine Network which began airing repeats of the series from 1 August 2017 until 21 November 2017.

In 2018, the series was released on Netflix in several regions, as well as the films and TV specials. In July 2019, the series was launched onto Netflix in Australia as well as the Kountdown Specials and Souvenir Editions.

In 2022, to mark its 20th anniversary the Seven Network began airing repeats of the series from 29 September 2022.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
&quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; premiered on 16 May 2002 and became one of ABC&#x27;s highest-rated shows. When the show premiered on the Seven Network, it became the highest-rating episode in Australian television history, until the record was broken by Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;&quot; on 9 February 2009. The fourth season of &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; debuted with a record-breaking 2.511 million viewers peaking at 2.731 million. In its second and third episodes viewers fell to 1.994 &amp; 1.817 million, respectively; however, viewers then rebounded for its fourth and fifth episodes with ratings of 2.047 and 2.157 million, respectively. Strong ratings continued with viewers of 2.049 and 2.066 million for the sixth and seventh episodes. The eighth episode and show&#x27;s finale rated 2.338 million giving the fourth season an average viewership of 2.122 million, making it the highest-rating TV season in Australia for 2007 and the highest-rating of all four seasons of the show.

In 2007, Channel Seven started showing repeats of the show from season one onwards which had previously only aired on the ABC network. The repeats proved quite successful, with the first two rating 1.465 and 1.530 million, winning in a very competitive timeslot and being amongst the highest-rating shows of the week.

In the UK, its BBC premiere drew viewing figures of 1.691 million in May 2005.

===Awards and nominations===
==Home media==
The enduring public interest and popularity of &quot;Kath and Kim&quot; has led to a merchandising industry. The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from T-shirts to posters.

==Spin-offs and adaptations==
===Feature film===
On 9 March 2011, Turner and Riley announced plans for a movie, in which, Kath, Kim, Kel, Brett, Sharon and Epponnee would head overseas on holiday. Contracts were written to finance the film&#x27;s production under the working title of &quot;The Kath &amp; Kim Filum&quot;, with the word &#x27;film&#x27; deliberately misspelt with the letter &#x27;u&#x27; in typical Kath and Kim yumour. However, the title &quot;Kath &amp; Kimderella&quot; was ultimately used, and the film was released in Australia on 6 September 2012. It was directed by Ted Emery (director of the television series) and produced by Rick McKenna. The holiday scenes were shot in Positano, Italy and filming took a total of two weeks.

The film was released in Australian cinemas on 6 September 2012. It grossed in excess of $2.1 million in its first weekend on Australian movie screens.

===20th Anniversary special===
In July 2022, it was reported that &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; will be returning for a 10-minute special to commentate 20 years of the series. The special will showcase a countdown of celebrity guests and unseen clips that didn&#x27;t feature in the series, as well as the cast discussing their favourite scenes. Celebrity guests for the special will include Mason Cox, Sonia Kruger and Celia Pacquola. The two specials, &quot;Kath and Kim: Our Effluent Life&quot; and &quot;Kath and Kim: 20 Preposterous Years&quot;, aired on 20 and 21 November 2022, respectively.

===American adaptation=== 
Due to the success that &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; has achieved internationally, it was remade for US audiences by NBC. Riley and Turner served as executive producers on the US version. In this remake, actress Molly Shannon has taken the role of Kath Day, and Selma Blair the role of Kim. The character of Sharon does not appear at the insistence of Szubanski.

NBC chose Jason Ensler to direct. Michelle Nader developed the series for American television, which premiered in the United States as part of the Fall schedule of 2008. The series started to shoot in California in July 2008. NBC debuted the US adaptation on 9 October 2008, while Seven started screening it to Australian viewers on 12 October 2008. After airing only two episodes, Seven dropped the sitcom from their lineup due to poor ratings, only to bring it back several weeks later as a late-night schedule filler. In America, reviews were poor, but it averaged roughly around 5 to 7 million viewers per week, and was rewarded with a full season order in October 2008. On 19 May 2009, NBC announced that there would not be a second season of &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;.

<doc id="376186" wikidata="Q269915" url="?curid=376186" title="Sinology">
<text>Sinology, also referred to as China studies, is a subfield of area studies or East Asian studies involved in social sciences and humanities research on China. It is an academic discipline that focuses on the study of the Chinese civilization primarily through Chinese language, history, culture, literature, philosophy, art, music, cinema, and science. Its origin &quot;may be traced to the examination which Chinese scholars made of their own civilization.&quot;

The academic field of sinology often refers to Western scholarship. Until the 20th century, it was historically seen as equivalent to philology concerning the Chinese classics and other literature written in the Chinese language. Since then, the scope of sinology has expanded to include Chinese history and palaeography, among other subjects.

==Terminology==
The terms &quot;sinology&quot; and &quot;sinologist&quot; were coined around 1838, derived from Late Latin , in turn from the Greek , from the Arabic —which ultimately derive from &quot;Qin&quot;, i.e. the Qin dynasty.

In the context of area studies, the European and the American usages may differ. In Europe, sinology is usually known as &quot;Chinese studies&quot;, whereas in the United States, sinology is a subfield of Chinese studies. A China watcher is a person who monitors current events and power struggles in China.

==Japanese sinology==

In Japan, sinology was known as . It was contrasted with the study of Japan () as well as with the study of the West (first , then more broadly ). This historical field is distinguished from modern sinology.

==Chinese sinology==
In modern China, the studies of China-related subjects is known as &quot;national studies&quot; (), and foreign sinology is translated as &quot;Han studies&quot; ().

==Western sinology==
===Early modern era===
The earliest Westerners known to have studied Chinese in significant numbers were 16th-century Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian missionaries. All were either Jesuits or Dominicans seeking to spread Catholic Christianity to the Chinese people. An early Spanish Dominican mission in Manila operated a printing press; between 1593 and 1607, they produced four works on Catholic doctrine for the Chinese immigrant community, three in Literary Chinese and one in a mixture of Literary Chinese and vernacular Hokkien.

Dominican accomplishments among the Chinese diaspora pale in comparison to the success of the Jesuits in mainland China, led by the renowned pioneer Matteo Ricci. Ricci arrived in Guangzhou in 1583, and would spend the rest of his life in China. Unlike most of his predecessors and contemporaries, Ricci did not view the Chinese firstly as pagans or idolators, but as &quot;like-minded literati approachable on the level of learning&quot;. Like Chinese literati, he studied the Confucian classics in order to present Catholic doctrine and European learning to the Chinese using their own terms.

===18th century===
During the Age of Enlightenment, sinologists started to introduce Chinese philosophy, ethics, legal system, and aesthetics into the West. Though often unscientific and incomplete, their works inspired the development of &quot;chinoiserie&quot; and a series of debates comparing Chinese and Western cultures. At that time, sinologists often described China as an enlightened kingdom, comparing it to Europe, which had just emerged from the Dark Ages. Among the European literati interested in China was Voltaire, who wrote the play &quot;L&#x27;orphelin de la Chine&quot; inspired by &quot;The Orphan of Zhao&quot;, Leibniz who penned his famous &quot;&quot; (News from China) and Giambattista Vico.

Because Chinese texts did not have any major connections to most important European topics (such as the Bible), they were scarcely studied by European universities until around 1860. An exception to this was France, where Chinese studies were popularized owing to efforts from Louis XIV. In 1711, he appointed a young Chinese man named Arcadio Huang to catalog the royal collection of Chinese texts. Huang was assisted by Étienne Fourmont, who published a grammar of Chinese in 1742. 

In 1732, Matteo Ripa, a missionary of the Neapolitan &quot;Sacred Congregation&quot; () founded the &quot;Chinese Institute&quot; in Naples—the first school of sinology on the European continent, and sanctioned by Pope Clement XII. The institute was first nucleus of what would become today&#x27;s . Ripa had worked as a painter and copper-engraver in the court of the Kangxi Emperor between 1711 and 1723, and returned to Naples with four young Chinese Christians, who all taught their native language and formed the institute to teach Chinese to missionaries en route to China.

===19th century===
In 1814, a chair of Chinese and Manchu was founded at . Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat, who taught himself Chinese, filled the position, becoming the first professor of Chinese in Europe. By then the first Russian sinologist, Nikita Bichurin, had been living in Beijing for ten years. Abel-Rémusat&#x27;s counterparts in England and Germany were Samuel Kidd (1797–1843) and Wilhelm Schott (1807–1889) respectively, though the first important secular sinologists in these two countries were James Legge and Hans Georg Conon von der Gabelentz. In 1878, a professorship of Far Eastern languages, the first of its kind in the German-speaking world, was created at the University of Leipzig with von der Gabelentz taking the position. Scholars like Legge often relied on the work of ethnic Chinese scholars such as Wang Tao.

Stanislas Julien served as the chair of Chinese at the for over 40 years, starting his studies with Rémusat and succeeding him in 1833. He was notable for his translations not only of classical texts but also works of vernacular literature, and for his knowledge of Manchu. Édouard Chavannes succeeded to the position after the death of Marquis d&#x27;Hervey-Saint-Denys in 1893. Chavannes pursued broad interests in history as well as language.

The image of China as an essentially Confucian society conveyed by Jesuit scholars dominated Western thought in these times. While some in Europe learned to speak Chinese, most studied written classical Chinese. These scholars were in what is called the &quot;commentarial tradition&quot; through critical annotated translation. This emphasis on translating classical texts inhibited the use of social science methodology or comparing these texts of other traditions. One scholar described this type of sinology as &quot;philological hairsplitting&quot; preoccupied with marginal or curious aspects. Secular scholars gradually came to outnumber missionaries, and in the 20th century sinology slowly gained a substantial presence in Western universities.

===20th and 21st centuries===
The Paris-based type of sinology dominated learning about China until the Second World War even outside France. Paul Pelliot, Henri Maspero, and Marcel Granet both published basic studies and trained students. Pelliot&#x27;s knowledge of the relevant languages, especially those of Central Asia, and control of bibliography in those languages, gave him the power to write on a range of topics and to criticize in damning detail the mistakes of other scholars. Maspero expanded the scope of sinology from Confucianism to include Daoism, Buddhism, and popular religion, as well as art, mythology, and the history of science. The contribution of Granet was to apply the concepts of Emile Durkheim, a pioneer sociologist, to the society of ancient China, especially the family and ritual.

The Russian school of sinology was focused mainly on learning classical Chinese texts. For example, the contribution of the Russian sinologist Julian Shchutsky was especially valuable. The best full translation of the &quot;I Ching&quot; (&quot;Book of Changes&quot;) was made by him in 1937. Later his translation was translated in English and other European languages.

After the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, China studies developed along diverging lines. The rise of Area studies, the role of China watchers, and the growth of university graduate programs has changed the role of sinology. Funding for Chinese and Taiwanese studies comes from a variety of sources; one prominent source is the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation.

The Area studies approach, especially in the United States, challenged the dominance of classical sinology. Scholars such as John King Fairbank promoted the &quot;study of China within a discipline,&quot; an approach which downplayed the role of philological sinology and focused on issues in history and the social sciences.

One of the earliest American scholars of Cold War China and Sino-American relations was Chinese-American Tang Tsou of the University of Chicago. Tsou emphasized the importance of academic objectivity in general and in sinology in particular, stressing that intellectual and academic exchange between China and the West was the only way for both parties to come to a greater understanding of one another.

In 1964 an exchange in the pages of the &quot;Journal of Asian Studies&quot; debated the continued relevance of sinology. The anthropologist G. William Skinner called for the social sciences to make more use of China, but wrote &quot;In recent years the cry has gone up: Sinology is dead; long live Chinese studies!&quot; and concluded that &quot;Sinology, a discipline unto itself, is being replaced by Chinese studies, a multidisciplinary endeavour with specific research objectives.&quot; Joseph Levenson, a historian, went further. He doubted that sinology was a tool that social scientists would still find useful, while another historian, Benjamin I. Schwartz, on the other hand, replied that the disciplines were too often treated as ends in themselves. Sinology had its backers. Frederick W. Mote, a specialist in traditional China, replying to Skinner, spoke up for sinology, which he saw as a field or discipline in itself. Another specialist in traditional China, Denis Twitchett, in reply to the back and forth of this debate, issued what he called &quot;A Lone Cheer for Sinology&quot;. He did not accept the assumption that there is &quot;some implicit hostility between &#x27;Sinology&#x27; and the disciplines of history and social sciences.&quot; Sinology, he continued, is used in too a wide range of meanings to be so confined:
:At one extreme it is used to characterize a rather ridiculous caricature compounded of pedantry and preoccupation with peripheral and precious subjects of little general significance... At the other extreme, the definition used by Prof. Mote is so broad and all-inclusive as to mean little more than the humanistic studies in the Chinese field.

During the Cold War, China Watchers centered in Hong Kong, especially American government officials or journalists. Mutual distrust between the United States and China and the prohibition of travel between the countries meant they did not have access to press briefings or interviews. They therefore adopted techniques from Kremlinology, such as the close parsing of official announcements for hidden meanings, movements of officials reported in newspapers, and analysis of photographs of public appearances. But in the years since the opening of China, China watchers can live in China and take advantage of normal sources of information.

Towards the end of the century, many of those studying China professionally called for an end to the split between sinology and the disciplines. The Australian scholar Geremie Barmé, for instance, suggests a &quot;New Sinology&quot;, one which &quot;emphasizes strong scholastic underpinnings in both the classical and modern Chinese language and studies, at the same time as encouraging an ecumenical attitude in relation to a rich variety of approaches and disciplines, whether they be mainly empirical or more theoretically inflected.&quot;

==Arab sinology==
===Before 1900===
Chinese historical sources indicate that the Chinese had knowledge of the Arabs several centuries before Islam, as the history of relations between the two civilizations dates back to the pre-Islamic era. The policy of the Han Dynasty (206 BC) aimed at opening trade routes with the western regions, which are today called Central Asia, India and Western Asia, extending to the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. Historical studies confirmed that Muslim Arabs entered China during the early days of Islam to spread the religion, when four of Muhammad&#x27;s companions namely Saad bin Abi Waqqas, Jaafar bin Abi Talib, and Jahsh bin Riab preached in China in the year 616/17. During the reign of Emperor Yongle, the first Chinese fleet arrived on the shores of the Arabian Peninsula, led by Zheng He, on his fourth voyage in 1412 AD. It is clear from the foregoing that there had been friction between China and the Arabs from a long time ago, and that there are cultural and commercial relations existing between the Arab and Chinese civilizations, which required the visiting Arabs to learn the Chinese language and vice versa. However, there are no texts indicating that the Arabs during this period studied the Chinese language or culture beyond what their missionary or trades affairs demanded, and the reason for this is due to the fact that the purpose of the visits was often to trade or to spread Islam.

At the beginning of the seventh century until the eighth century, the power of the Arabs increased due to the expansion of Islam and its spread throughout the world, and their control expanded to the east and west. Their power was strengthened by their vast lands, their advanced network of postal stations, and the pilgrimage to Mecca, in addition to the flourishing of land and sea trade. All this led to the advancement of their studies in geography and thus, new knowledge about China found its way to the Arab world. Up to the twelfth century, the Arabs possessed exclusive knowledge about the East, and they were contributing to the transmission of knowledge to the West, which contributed to the advancement of Islamic civilization and its impact on world culture.

Arabs such as Abu al-Hasan Ali al-Masoudi, who is a well-known historical figure in the Arabian Peninsula, made significant contributions to sinology. Al-Masoudi has traveled all over the world since he was a child, visiting faraway places. In the year 915, he visited India, Ceylon, Champa, and the coastal regions of China, and then visited Zabagh and Turkistan in Central Asia. He died in the year 956, and he is the author of the book &quot;Meadows of Gold&quot;, which deals with history, geography, and other fields. He had many records about China, and these records were popular among orient scholars.

Abu Zayd&#x27;s book &quot;On China and India&quot; was a well-known and highly regarded Arabic historical material. The book had two separate parts, the first part was &quot;History of Indian and Chinese Affairs&quot; by an unknown author, and the second part was &quot;A Collection of Rumors of India and China&quot; by Abu Zayd. The first part was a selection from Solomon&#x27;s &quot;Chinese experiences&quot; and other anonymous sources, written and recorded in 851, together with their experiences in India.

===20th century and after===
During the 20th century, projects of cooperation between China and the Arab countries led to the development of sinology in the Arab countries nominally after expanding the scope of Chinese-Arab cooperation in the field of education, with some difference according to the level of cooperation. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Egypt in 1956, Egypt began to open the Chinese language specialization course in Egyptian universities, but on a small scale at that time. Ain Shams University opened the Chinese language specialization in 1958. However, the course was stopped for prevailing political reasons at the time. In the period between 1958 and 1963, 33 Chinese language students graduated from Egyptian universities. In 1977, Ain Shams University reintroduced the sinology specialization course. In addition to Egypt, there were activities to teach the Chinese language in Kuwait as well, but they stopped after a short period.

The number of Arabs that learn the Chinese Language has increased. The Chinese Language Department at Ain Shams University is a major center for teaching the Chinese language in Egypt and one of the notable centers for teaching the Chinese language in the Arab world and Africa in terms of student size, teaching quality, and the level of teachers and staff. The Bourguiba Institute for Modern Languages was also opened in Tunisia, and it specializes in the Chinese language in 1977. Cairo University also established the Chinese Language Department in September 2004 becoming a major center for sinology is North Africa.

Arab scholars sought to delve deeper into sinology for academic, political, cultural and diplomatic purposes in order to build a bridge of communication between the Arab and Chinese peoples. Their interest in the history of China also increased greatly. Many books related to the history of Chinese culture and its people were published in the Arabic language. In 2020 after spending about six years as a consul in Guangzhou, Ali bin Ghanem Al-Hajri, a Qatari diplomat who is considered one of the Arabs with a lot of original Arabic academic works in sinology, published the book &quot;Zheng He, Chinese Emperor of the Seas&quot;. The book covers the history and adventures of a Chinese commander by the name Zheng He whose fleet went round the known world in seven voyages between the years 1415 and 1432. He also wrote before that the novel &quot;The Fleet of the Sun&quot; inspired by the story of the Chinese commander. It was considered the first Arabic novel with a Chinese as the central character, thus it achieved some fame in the Arab world, although it was not published until recently. He also published &quot;China in the Eyes of Travelers&quot;, a book that delved deep into the history of ancient China through the discoveries made by travellers and explorers. Al-hajri further wrote the book &quot;Arts in the Ming Dynasty&quot;, in which he elaborated on the political and economic development of the Ming Dynasty and the historical development of Chinese culture. Four of his books are translated into Chinese

Many books have been translated from Chinese into Arabic as part of these efforts. Where more than 700 books about the people of China, their culture, economy, literature and philosophy have been translated into Arabic by the (House of Wisdom) company located in the Ningxia Hui region, northwest China since its establishment in 2011.

<text>The National Audubon Society (Audubon; ) is an American non-profit environmental organization dedicated to conservation of birds and their habitats. Located in the United States and incorporated in 1905, Audubon is one of the oldest of such organizations in the world. There are completely independent Audubon Societies in the United States, which were founded several years earlier such as the Massachusetts Audubon Society, Indiana Audubon Society, and Connecticut Audubon Society. The societies are named for 19th century naturalist John James Audubon.

The society has nearly 500 local chapters, each of which is an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organization voluntarily affiliated with the National Audubon Society. They often organize birdwatching field trips and conservation-related activities. It also coordinates the Christmas Bird Count held each December in the U.S., a model of citizen science, in partnership with Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and the Great Backyard Bird Count each February. Together with Cornell University, Audubon created eBird, an online database for bird observation. The National Audubon Society also has many global partners to help birds that migrate beyond the U.S.&#x27;s borders, including BirdLife International based in Great Britain, Bird Studies Canada, American Bird Conservancy, and many partners in Latin America and in the Caribbean. Audubon&#x27;s International Alliances Program (IAP) brings together people throughout the Western Hemisphere to work together to implement conservation solutions at Important Birds Areas (IBAs).

==History==
===Development of Audubon societies===
In 1886, &quot;Forest and Stream&quot; editor George Bird Grinnell was appalled by the As a boy, Grinnell had avidly read &quot;Ornithological Biography&quot;, a work by the bird painter John James Audubon; he also lived in his early years in a development of the former Audubon estate, Audubon Park in upper Manhattan, and attended a school for boys conducted by Lucy Audubon. The Audubon name would become the namesake of the society he founded, and after its failure, that of local, state, and a national organization bearing that name.

In 1890, a Chicago-based Audubon Society was started under the presidency of E. Irene Rood. About 70 persons joined and the Society was incorporated in 1893.

Within a year of Grinnell founding it his early Audubon Society claimed 39,000 members, eventually growing to 48,862. Each member signed a pledge to &quot;not molest birds&quot;. Prominent members included jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., abolitionist minister Henry Ward Beecher, and poet John Greenleaf Whittier. In under a decade this society was discontinued, but the name and plan survived.

Organizations for the protection of birds were not a wholly new idea. Even before Grinnell&#x27;s Audubon Society was organized, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, founded in 1883, was aware of the dangers facing many birds in the United States. There were, however, influential ornithologists who defended the collection of birds. In 1902, Charles B. Cory, the president-elect of the AOU refused to attend a meeting of the District of Columbia Audubon Society stating that &quot;I do not protect birds. I kill them.&quot;
In 1895, a second iteration of the Audubon Society was created, with an unbroken history that traces to today. Cousins and Boston socialites, Harriet Hemenway and Minna B. Hall, disturbed by the destruction left by plume hunters, organized a series of afternoon teas with other wealthy local women, encouraging them to avoid feathered garments. They also sent literature asking these women to, in Hall&#x27;s words, &quot;join a society for the protection of birds, especially the egret&quot;. Later that same year, they founded the Massachusetts Audubon Society. Over 900 women came together with Hemenway and Hall, and across the country, many others were doing the same. These boycotts were largely successful, and the efforts of the early society members helped bring about the end of the plume trade and assisted in the introduction of early conservation legislation such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. In 1896, Pennsylvania created their Audubon Society, and during the next few years, bird lovers in many other states followed suit. St. Louis Audubon Society (SLAS) was established in 1916 as the St Louis Bird Club. In 1944, the Bird Club became the first local Audubon chapter in the United States. The national committee of Audubon societies was organized at a meeting held in Washington, D.C. in 1902. 1905 saw the organization of the National Association of Audubon Societies for the Protection of Wild Birds and Animals; William Dutcher was president, and T. Gilbert Pearson was secretary and financial agent. During this time, Albert Willcox provided financial support, more than $331,072 in 1905 and 1906. At the end of 1906, the Association had an interest-bearing endowment fund of more than $336,000 and an income from other sources of approximately $9,000.

===Bird protection===
Birds in the United States were threatened by market hunting as well as for the fashion industry. Pressure from shooting enthusiasts was intense. For example, great auks, whose habit of crowding together on rocks and beaches made them especially easy to hunt, had been driven to extinction early in the century. During one week in the spring of 1897, nature author Florence Merriam claimed to have seen 2,600 robins for sale in one market stall in Washington alone. By the start of the 20th century, the sale of bird flesh had never been greater. The second equally great threat to the bird population was the desire for their plumage. In the late 1890s, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union estimated that five million birds were killed annually for the fashion market. In the final quarter of the 19th century, plumes, and even whole birds, decorated the hair, hats, and dresses of women. Poachers killed game warden Guy Bradley on July 8, 1905; poachers killed Game Warden Columbus G. McLeod in November 1908 in Florida and Audubon Society employee Pressly Reeves of South Carolina also in 1908.

Public opinion soon turned on the fashion industry. Bolstered by the support of Boston socialite Harriet Hemenway, President of the United States and avowed Audubon Society sympathizer Theodore Roosevelt, and a widespread letter-writing campaign driven by church associations, many of whom distributed the Audubon message in their various newsletters, the plume trade was halted by such laws as the New York State Audubon Plumage Law (May 1910), which banned the sales of plumes of all native birds in the state. By 1920, similar laws were enacted in about 12 other states. Audubon Society activities are responsible for many laws for the establishment of game commissions and game warden forces or prohibiting the sale of game.

===Refuges===

In 1918, the NAS actively lobbied for the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. In the 1920s, the organization also played a vital role in convincing the U.S. government to protect vital wildlife areas by including them in a National Wildlife Refuge system.

The association also acquired land through purchases and donation. The Theodore Roosevelt Sanctuary and Audubon Center in Oyster Bay, New York was donated to New York Audubon in 1923 by Emlen Roosevelt and Christine Roosevelt in memory of their cousin, who is buried in the adjacent Youngs Memorial Cemetery. The Audubon Center of Greenwich, Connecticut was founded in 1943. The Paul J. Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary in Louisiana was acquired in 1924, and at it is still the largest.

In the late 20th century, the organization began to place a new emphasis on the development of Centers in urban locations, including Brooklyn, New York; East Los Angeles, California; Phoenix, Arizona; and Seattle, Washington.

===Field guides===
In 1934, with membership at a low of 3,500, and with the nation in the Great Depression, John H. Baker became the NAS president. He was a World War I aviator and ardent bird lover, and also a businessman, and he set about to invigorate the society and bolster its budget prosperity through publication. Baker began publishing book-length field guides on major forms of bird and mammal life. Soon, in association with New York publisher Alfred A. Knopf, the &quot;Audubon Field Guide&quot;s became a staple of every artist&#x27;s and environmentalist&#x27;s library. Today, many Audubon field guides have been adapted for mobile phone apps. This field guide series covers a wide range of nature-related topics, including the night sky, rocks and minerals, wildflowers, and many animals. This series has sold 18 million copies and uses photographs instead of the commissioned paintings or other drawings that many other field guides possess, such as the Peterson Field Guides.

===DDT, whaling, and politics===
During the post-World War II period, the NAS was consumed by the battle over the pesticide DDT. As early as 1960, the society circulated draft legislation to establish pesticide control agencies at the state level. In 1962 the publication of Silent Spring by long-time Audubon member Rachel Carson gave the campaign against &quot;persistent pesticides&quot; a huge national forum. Following her death in 1964, the NAS established a fund devoted strictly to the various legal fights in the war against DDT.

Today, Audubon selects outstanding women in conservation to receive its prestigious Rachel Carson Award. Honorees include Bette Midler, singer, actress, and founder of the New York Restoration Project; Dr. Sylvia Earle, oceanographer and founder of Deep Search International; Majora Carter, founder and executive director of Sustainable South Bronx; actress and conservation activist Sigourney Weaver, and Natural Resources Defense Council president Frances Beinecke.

Through the 1960s and 1970s, the society began to use its influence to focus attention on a wider range of environmental issues and became involved in developing major new environmental protection policies and laws. Audubon staff and members helped legislators pass the Clean Air, Clean Water, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and Endangered Species acts. In 1969, the society opened an office in Washington, D.C., in an effort to keep legislators informed of Audubon&#x27;s priorities.

By the 1970s, NAS had also extended to global interests. One area that NAS became actively involved with was whaling. Between 1973 and 1974 alone, the poorly regulated whaling industry had succeeded in harvesting 30,000 whales. But by 1985, following the 37th annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Bournemouth, England, which was attended by officials from the National Audubon Society and other U.S.-based environmental organizations, a worldwide moratorium on whaling was declared. So successful has this moratorium been in restoring populations of many whales, that &quot;non-consumptive uses of whales&quot; may once again be permitted in some areas.

===Television specials===
During the 1980s and 1990s, the National Audubon Society produced a notable series of nature documentary television specials, many of which were entitled &quot;The World of Audubon&quot;. These included specials on many animals other than birds (the traditional focus of this organization) and on natural areas such as the Great Lakes. This series included a special documenting the rescue efforts to save the black-footed ferret from extinction. Arthur Unger of the Christian Science Monitor reviewed this special very favorably and wrote that this special was &quot;further proof that the Audubon series deserves a place in television&#x27;s splendid wildlife triumvirate alongside &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;National Geographic Specials&quot;&quot;.

==Current activities==
In 2011, Audubon created a new model for positioning energy transmission lines along the East Coast to help preserve bird and wildlife habitat. Audubon President David Yarnold has made environmentally friendly siting for renewable energy one of the organization&#x27;s highest priorities.

Audubon played an important part in bird rescue and Gulf Coast wetlands recovery efforts in the aftermath of the April 20, 2010, BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. Audubon recruited over 34,000 volunteers to assist in rescuing, cleaning and releasing injured brown pelicans and other water birds. In addition, Audubon was a leader in pushing for legislation to use BP oil spill penalties to rebuild the Gulf Coast.

Audubon&#x27;s Mississippi River and Louisiana Coastal Initiatives have been helping to restore coastal wetlands and to rebuild Mississippi River delta marshlands. The Mississippi Delta loses an area the size of Manhattan to the sea every year, stripping away coastal protections for both human communities and wildlife habitat.

Audubon&#x27;s Important Bird Area program has been protecting 370 million acres along migratory bird flyways in the United States and is a key part of Audubon&#x27;s work with BirdLife International and other conservationists around the globe. Audubon is leading the campaign for U.S. Congressional Reauthorization of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act which would generate as much as $100 million each year to advance hemispheric bird conservation.

In Wyoming and across the Intermountain west, Audubon&#x27;s Sagebrush Initiative works with industry, government, ranchers and conservationists to protect 15 million acres of greater sage grouse Core habitat. It also helps promote the development of renewable energy projects in the area.

Audubon also helped to secure the preservation of 240,000 acres of wild lands at the Tejon Ranch, the largest land conservation area created in California history.

In March 2020, the Arkansas chapter of the Audubon Society announced its plan to spend $80,000 to install solar panels on its grounds, which will make their Little Rock office the state&#x27;s first nonprofit to utilize 100% solar energy.

===Sanctuaries and nature centers===
Nature centers and wildlife sanctuaries continue to be an important part of Audubon&#x27;s work to educate and inspire the public about the environment and how to conserve it. Some of the Audubon&#x27;s earliest nature centers are still teaching young and old alike about the natural world. In 2016, Audubon&#x27;s Hog Island Camp in Maine marked its 80th anniversary. Audubon&#x27;s national network currently includes nearly 500 local chapters, 23 state programs, 41 nature centers. After nearly three-quarters of a century, the National Wildlife Refuge Campaign also remains a key component of overall NAS policy.

===Conservation ranching initiative===
Audubon has begun to certify bird-friendly ranching facilities, such as the Blue Nest Beef enterprise in order to provide consumers with a method of determining the environmental credentials of the businesses advertising that they are providing &quot;bird-friendly&quot;, &quot;grass-fed&quot;, and similar products, as options for beef that is raised sustainably and benefits wildlife habitat.

===Native plants database===
An online database is provided by Audubon that displays which native plants are important for birds in different areas that is searchable by USA zip code.

===Invasive species===
Audubon has recently expanded its outreach about the detrimental impact of invasive species like Norway maples, Tatarian honeysuckle and other ecological threats to human health and wildlife.

===Drilling for natural gas===
The Audubon society opposes drilling for gas on national reserves. Natural gas has been drilled for and produced at its Paul J. Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary. The society said it was legally compelled to allow gas and oil drilling at the sanctuary under the terms of the land&#x27;s donation by its original owners. This explanation, however, has been challenged. The presence of oil and gas drilling on Audubon&#x27;s sanctuaries has been used to illustrate the difference between private and public decision-making.

An August 26, 2009, an open letter was sent to the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee calling for stronger climate protections, including an end to subsidies for drilling companies. This signatories of this letter included the Central New Mexico Audubon Society, Champaign County Audubon Society, Delaware Audubon Society, Elisha Mitchell Audubon Society, Huachuca Audubon Society, Kalmiopsis Audubon Society, San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society, Sequoia Audubon Society, and Audubon South Carolina.

===Dan W. Lufkin Prize for Environmental Leadership===
The Dan W. Lufkin Prize for Environmental Leadership is a new award that recognizes Dan W. Lufkin&#x27;s lifetime commitment to the environment and honors individuals who have dedicated their lives to on-the-ground conservation. As part of this award, the recipient receives a $100,000 cash prize, made through an endowment established by Dan&#x27;s family and friends, to help further his or her conservation efforts. This award will become a signature prize in the field of conservation innovation. George Archibald was the inaugural Dan W. Lufkin Prize recipient for his tireless efforts to protect all species of cranes and their habitats throughout the world. The Wall Street Journal featured Dan W. Lufkin as the Donor of the Day, for the creation of this new Audubon prize.

===Women in Conservation Program===
The Rachel Carson Award is part of a broader Audubon initiative called Women in Conservation Project. Their mission statement is &quot;To recognize outstanding women leaders in today&#x27;s conservation movement; to support environmental opportunities for girls and young women; and to educate women on important issues related to conservation and the environment.&quot; Audubon New York created the Rachel Carson Field Internship in 2012, which is given to young women seeking experience in the fields of &quot;habitat-stewardship and wildlife-management&quot;. There is also the Women in Conservation Fellowship. These internships are given to women who wish to learn about areas such as public relations, management, and event planning.

===Climate change report===
In September 2014, the Audubon Society released its &quot;Audubon Birds and Climate Change&quot; report which found that expected changes to North American climate will have a major, detrimental impact on birds in the United States. The scope of the report includes 588 species of birds and found that 314 of those species could lose up to half of their climatic range during the 21st-century.

=== Namesake controversy ===
The society was named in honor of John James Audubon, a Franco-American ornithologist and naturalist who painted, cataloged, and described the birds of North America in his famous &quot;Birds of America&quot; book (1827–1838). Despite these accolades, John James Audubon&#x27;s legacy has been tarnished by numerous accusations of plagiarism and scientific fraud, which his biographers (and Audubon&#x27;s leadership) have routinely dismissed or minimized, even while admitting to his history of racism and slavery. John James Audubon was who collected human skulls to assist the scientific racism work of Samuel G. Morton. In the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, there have been public appeals to strip the name Audubon from the society and change the names of species that honor him. The Audubon Society has publicly supported the removal of Confederate monuments, including acknowledging that &quot;it&#x27;s not just an issue of physical monuments&quot;.

An internal Board of Directors vote in 2023 resulted in a decision to retain the Audubon name for the national organization, with the subsequent resignation of three of its 26 board members. In February 2023, the union representing Audubon employees renamed itself The Bird Union. Seven months earlier, in July 2022, the Seattle chapter of Audubon announced they would change the name, and later announced the new name would be Birds Connect Seattle, effective June 2023. Shortly after the Seattle chapter&#x27;s announcement in February, the Chicago chapter also announced they will change their name. In March 2023, the New York City chapter announced that after studying the issue for eight months, it will change its name; Jessica Wilson, executive director of the NYC chapter, stated that the current name &quot;served as a barrier to getting all New Yorkers involved&quot;. Chapters in other cities such as Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, and Buffalo, New York, have made similar announcements.

==Leadership==

David Yarnold became Audubon&#x27;s 10th president in September 2010, expressing a commitment to build on the organization&#x27;s strong conservation legacy and expand its commitment to improving the quality of life for both birds and people by aligning Audubon&#x27;s conservation work along the migratory flyways that millions of birds travel each spring and fall. Following layoffs and complaints about diversity and inclusion programs, an Audubon union organizing drive went public in March 2021 with about 400 workers. Yarnold stepped down the next month following an internal audit into Audubon&#x27;s workplace culture and toxic workplace complaints. Elizabeth Gray was named Audubon&#x27;s CEO in November, 2021.

<text>David Dacko (; 24 March 1930 – 20 November 2003) was a Central African politician who served as the first President of the Central African Republic from 14 August 1960 to 1 January 1966 and as the third President of the Central African Republic from 21 September 1979 to 1 September 1981. He also served as Prime Minister of the Central African Republic from 1 May 1959 to 14 August 1960. After his second removal from power in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; led by General André Kolingba, he pursued an active career as an opposition politician and presidential candidate with many loyal supporters; Dacko was an important political figure in the country for over 50 years.

==Early life and education==
Dacko was born in the village of Bouchia, near Mbaïki in the Lobaye region (which was then a part of the French Equatorial African territory of Ubangi-Shari), to Joseph Iniabodé and Marie Okolania. His parents belonged to the same ethnic group. A M&#x27;Baka (Ngbaka), he was a distant cousin of future rival Jean-Bédel Bokassa. Soon after Dacko&#x27;s birth, his family moved to Boda, where his father worked in a store belonging to a European coffee planter in Bonini named Tancret. In 1937, his father converted to Catholicism, after which he decided to stay married to one wife and sent the others away, including his mother. In 1938, he was sent to live with his uncle, Jêrome Gaza in Mbaïki. He began primary school in Mbaiki, where his father worked as a plantation&#x27;s night watchman. He continued his primary education in Bambari before being admitted to the Ecole normale of Mouyoundzi in Moyen Congo. Studying for a career in teaching, he became schoolmaster of a large primary school in the capital, Bangui in 1951.

Dacko took part in an experimental educational program promoted by the French colonial administration. Dacko was named principal of Kouanga College in 1955 and became a supporter of independence leader Barthélémy Boganda, who was from the same Ngbaka ethnic group as Dacko.
==Political career==
===Early political career ===
In March 1957 Dacko presented himself as a candidate for legislative elections in Ubangi-Shari for the circumscription of Ombella-M&#x27;Poko and won a seat as a member of the &quot;Territorial Assembly of Ubangi-Shari&quot;. When the first Council of Government of Ubangi-Shari was established that same year, Boganda named Dacko Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Water and Forests, in which position he served from 14 May 1957 until 23 August 1958. Dacko then served as Minister of the Interior and Administrative Affairs from 23 August to 8 December 1958.

When the Territorial Assembly became the Legislative Constitutive Assembly on 1 December 1958, Dacko and his fellow Territorial Councilors became Deputies. Dacko remained in the government as the Minister of the Interior, Economy and Commerce (8 December 1958 – 30 April 1959).

On 29 March 1959, Boganda died in a plane crash. Étienne Ngounio was decided upon as the new head of the party as well as Boganda&#x27;s replacement as the mayor of Bangui. His replacement as president, however, remained undetermined. Abel Goumba put forward his candidacy, although various circles within the party had reservations about him. Dacko states that he was convinced to accept candidacy by a group of Assembly members from MESAN, namely Gabriel Barrot, Thomas Lemotomo, Ibrahim Tello, Robert Sama, Bellet Herman and Alphonse Yokadouma. At the plenary meeting of the Assembly, his name was put forward as a candidate by Tello, and he was elected president with 39 votes against Goumba&#x27;s 11. In October 1959, Goumba and Ngounio proposed that Dacko be replaced by Pierre Maléombho as president, but as it became obvious that the motion would not succeed, they ended up withdrawing it within a week, before it could be discussed at the Assembly.

===First term as president===

After independence on 13 August 1960, Dacko became Provisional President of the Republic (14 August–12 December 1960), and then, with the active French support against rival Abel Goumba, became the first President of the Central African Republic (12 December 1960 – 31 December 1965). In 1960, he also served as President of the Conference of Prime Ministers of Equatorial Africa.

Dacko began to consolidate his power soon after taking office in 1960. He retained the portfolio of Minister of Defense (17 August 1960 – 1 January 1966) and Keeper of the Seals (17 August 1960 – 2 January 1963) and amended the Constitution to transform his regime into a one-party state with a strong presidency elected for a term of seven years. On 5 January 1964, Dacko was elected in an election in which he ran alone.

During his first term as president, Dacko significantly increased diamond production in the Central African Republic by eliminating the monopoly on mining held by concessionary companies and decreeing that any Central African could dig for diamonds. He also succeeded in having a diamond-cutting factory built in Bangui. Diamonds eventually became the country&#x27;s most important export and remain so today, even though at least half of the country&#x27;s diamonds are smuggled out of the country.
Dacko encouraged the rapid &quot;Centralafricanization&quot; of the country&#x27;s administration, which was accompanied by growing corruption and inefficiency, and he expanded the number of civil servants, which greatly increased the portion of the national budget needed to pay salaries. The difficulty of securing enough revenues to pay a large number of bureaucrats who are often inefficient and corrupt has been a major problem for the country ever since.

Dacko was torn between his need to retain the support of France and his need to show that he was not subservient to France. In order to cultivate alternative sources of support and display his independence in foreign policy, he cultivated closer relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. By 1965, Dacko had lost the support of most Central Africans and may have been planning to resign from the presidency when he was overthrown.

===Overthrown by Bokassa===

On the night of 31 December 1965 – 1 January 1966, General Bokassa carried out a successful coup d&#x27;état against Dacko and prevented the possible assumption of power by a rival, Colonel Jean Izamo, head of the national gendarme police force. Dacko, who belonged to the same Ngbaka ethnic group as Bokassa, was imprisoned, placed under house arrest in Lobaye, but then was released on 16 July 1969 and eventually named personal counselor of President Bokassa on 17 September 1976. When Bokassa&#x27;s rule came under increasing criticism during the late 1970s, Dacko managed to leave for Paris where the French convinced him to cooperate in a &quot;coup&quot; to remove Bokassa from power and restore him to the presidency.

===Restored to power===

On the night of 20–21 September 1979, French paratroopers carried out Operation Barracuda, which overthrew Bokassa and restored Dacko to the presidency. In March 1981, Dacko was elected President of the Republic once again in a reasonably free multi-candidate election; his term began on 1 April.

Upon return to office, Dacko found himself forced to retain many of the officials who had been part of the Bokassa regime, as the country had no more than one hundred trained personnel available for government posts. The retention of this political elite was an additional factor in heightening the resentment against him. Immediately after his restoration Dacko found financial support from France, who provided his government with $17 million, leading to relative success in his first six months. This did not, however, translate to any support from the general international community, who regarded Dacko as a French surrogate. With French support, the European Economic Community was persuaded to give $20 million in aid, which was intended for the revitalisation of the crumbling agricultural sector, particularly coffee production, as well as developing infrastructure.

Dacko was regarded by many Central Africans as a puppet of the French and his right to rule was challenged, in particular, by Bokassa&#x27;s former prime minister, Ange-Félix Patassé who, in addition to belonging to the largest ethnic group in the country, the Gbaya, had residential and kinship ties to other ethnic groups and was the most popular politician in the country. Patassé&#x27;s opposition drew on the support of high school students as well as young unemployed adults in the shanty towns next to Bangui, such as Muskine. His opposition, however, was quashed by November 1979 with French support. As Dacko&#x27;s government was sometimes unable to pay wages on time, further discontent arose amongst teachers, students and deprived urban residents, and led to strike as well as attacks on Dacko&#x27;s officials. These protests were at times countered by the police. French aid then improved the timeliness of the salary payments, and Dacko was also able to introduce further scholarships for high school and university students, leading to an erosion of opposition. Furthermore, Dacko&#x27;s government organised the public trials of some of Bokassa&#x27;s officers. These took place in the main stadium in Bangui and were broadcast on radio, thus increasing Dacko&#x27;s popularity, despite some skepticism amongst urban Central Africans.

===Overthrown by Kolingba===
On 1 September 1981, Dacko was overthrown in a bloodless coup carried out by army chief of staff General André Kolingba, who may have had the support of local French security officers who are suspected of having acted without authorization by François Mitterrand&#x27;s new Socialist government in France. Such allegations may never be substantiated, but Kolingba did subsequently enjoy a very close relationship with France and a presidential security team led by Colonel Mantion. Dacko, unharmed, later returned to politics to lead the Movement for Democracy and Development (MDD), a party opposing Kolingba. Dacko participated in the presidential elections of 1992 and 1993 and in the latter obtained 20.10% of the votes cast.

==Opposition, illness and death==
During Patassé&#x27;s first and second presidential terms (1993–99 and 1999–2003), Dacko continued to participate actively in politics as a leader of the opposition. Dacko and Kolingba were the main leaders of the opposition, with Kolingba having more influence than Dacko. Dacko ran for president for the last time in the 1999 elections, coming in third place with 11.2% of the vote.

After General François Bozizé overthrew Patassé and proclaimed himself president, Dacko participated in the &quot;Dialogue national&quot; (National Dialogue) that began on 9 September 2003, but shortly thereafter, on 27 September, he began suffering effects from his chronic asthma and heart disease. He headed to France to seek treatment, but during a stopover in Yaoundé, Cameroon on 7 November, he was taken to the General Hospital of Yaoundé where he died at 10 p.m. on 20 November. The Central African government declared a month of national mourning in his memory. On 13 December he was buried in Mokinda, near his residence.

==Family and awards==
In 1952, David Dacko married his first wife, Florence Yagbao, an ethnic Gbanziri woman. Their only son, Bruno Dacko (born 1952), is a politician who served as Minister of Tourism from 2003 to 2005. In 1962, he divorced Florence, who had become the country&#x27;s inaugural first lady. Yagbao died in 1992.
David Dacko married his second wife, Brigette Teya, in 1962 shortly after his divorce from his first wife. Brigette Dacko was from the city of Bimbo and a member of the Mbaka people. The couple had seven sons and four daughters. Former First Lady Brigette Dacko died on March 31, 2023.

David Dacko received many awards and honors during his lifetime, including Commander of the Central African Order of Agriculture (23 April 1963), Commander of the Central African Order of Academic Palms (26 June 1964). A major street in Bangui is named after him, Avenue President David Dacko.

<text>Samuel Todd Francis (April 29, 1947 – February 15, 2005), known as Sam Francis, was an American white supremacist writer. He was a columnist and editor for the conservative &quot;Washington Times&quot; until he was dismissed after making racist remarks at the 1995 &quot;American Renaissance&quot; conference. Francis would later become a &quot;dominant force&quot; on the Council of Conservative Citizens, a white supremacist organization identified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Francis was chief editor of the council&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;Citizens Informer&quot;, until his death in 2005. White supremacist Jared Taylor called Francis &quot;the premier philosopher of white racial consciousness of our time.&quot;

Political scientist and writer George Michael, an expert on extremism, identified Francis as one of &quot;the far right&#x27;s higher-caliber intellectuals.&quot; The Southern Poverty Law Center described Francis as an important white nationalist writer known for his &quot;ubiquitous presence of his columns in racist forums and his influence over the general direction of right-wing extremism&quot; in the United States. Analyst Leonard Zeskind called Francis the &quot;philosopher king&quot; of the radical right, writing that, &quot;By any measure, Francis&#x27;s white nationalism was as subtle as an eight-pound hammer pounding on a twelve inch I beam.&quot; Scholar Chip Berlet described Francis as an ultraconservative ideologue akin to Pat Buchanan, whom Francis advised. Anarcho-capitalist political theorist Hans-Hermann Hoppe called Francis &quot;one of the leading theoreticians and strategists of the Buchananite movement.&quot;

==Early life==
Francis was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1969, and a master&#x27;s degree in 1971 and doctorate in 1979 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==Career==

===&quot;The Washington Times&quot; ===
Francis was a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation and an aide to Republican Senator John East of North Carolina before joining the editorial staff of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; in 1986. Five years later, he became a columnist for the newspaper, and his column became syndicated.

In addition to his journalistic career, Francis was an adjunct scholar at the Ludwig von Mises Institute of Auburn, Alabama.

In June 1995, editor-in-chief Wesley Pruden &quot;had cut back on Francis&#x27; column&quot; after &quot;The Washington Times&quot; ran his essay criticizing the Southern Baptist Convention for its approval of a resolution which apologized for slavery. In the piece, Francis asserted that &quot;The contrition of the Southern Baptists for slavery and racism is a bit more than a politically fashionable gesture intended to massage race relations&quot; and that &quot;Neither slavery&#x27; nor racism&#x27; as an institution is a sin.&quot;

In September 1995, Pruden fired Francis from &quot;The Washington Times&quot; after conservative journalist Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, in a column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, described Francis&#x27;s appearance at the 1994 &quot;American Renaissance&quot; conference: &quot;A lively controversialist, Francis began with some largely valid complaints about how the Southern heritage is demonized in mainstream culture. He went on, however, to attack the liberal principles of humanism and universalism for facilitating &#x27;the war against the white race.&#x27; At one point he described country music megastar Garth Brooks as &#x27;repulsive&#x27; because &#x27;he has that stupid universalist song &quot;(We Shall Be Free)&quot;, in which we all intermarry.&#x27; His fellow whites, he insisted, must &#x27;reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites… The civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor is there any reason to believe that the civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people.&#x27;&quot;

After D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s column was published, Pruden &quot;decided he did not want the Times associated with such views after looking into other Francis writings, in which he advocated the possible deportation of legal immigrants and forced birth control for welfare mothers.&quot;

Francis said soon after the firing that &quot;I believe there are racial differences, there are natural differences between the races. I don&#x27;t believe that one race is better than another. There&#x27;s reasonably solid evidence for IQ differences, personality and behavior differences. I understand those things have been taken to justify segregation and white supremacy. That is not my intent.&quot;

===Later career===
After being fired from &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Francis continued to write a column, which was syndicated through Creators Syndicate at least as early as January 2000.

Francis became a &quot;dominant force&quot; on the Council of Conservative Citizens. Francis was chief editor of the council&#x27;s quarterly newsletter, &quot;Citizens Informer&quot;, until his death in 2005. Francis wrote the council&#x27;s &quot;Statement of Principles&quot;, which &quot;called for America to be a Christian nation&quot; and &quot;oppose[d] all efforts to mix the races of mankind.&quot; In his writings, Francis advocated for a moratorium on all immigration, plus an indefinite suspension of all immigration from non-European and non-Western people.

Francis was also an editor of &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot;, a white nationalist journal edited by Kevin Lamb and sponsored by William Regnery II.

He served as a contributor and editor of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute&#x27;s quarterly, &quot;Modern Age&quot;. After his dismissal from &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot;, Francis continued to write a syndicated column for &quot;VDARE&quot; and &quot;Chronicles&quot; magazine, and spoke at meetings of American Renaissance and the Council of Conservative Citizens. He attended the American Friends of the British National Party&#x27;s meeting on April 22, 2000, where he heard and met Nick Griffin. His articles also appeared in &quot;Middle American News&quot;. Francis&#x27; last published work was an article penned for the 2005 IHS Press anti-war anthology, &quot;Neo-Conned!&quot;.

Francis died on February 15, 2005, at Prince George&#x27;s Hospital Center in Cheverly, Maryland, following an unsuccessful surgery to treat an aortic aneurysm. He was 57. Francis was buried at the foot of Lookout Mountain.

==Thought and legacy==

Francis&#x27;s term &quot;&quot; refers to armed dictatorship without rule of law, or a Hegelian synthesis when the state tyrannically or oppressively regulates citizens&#x27; lives yet is unable or unwilling to enforce fundamental protective law. Commentators have invoked the term in reference to situations when governments focus on weapon confiscation instead of stopping looters. On Francis&#x27;s death, the Rockford Institute magazine &quot;&quot; dedicated its April 2005 issue to his memory and the concept. Francis had a significant influence on the paleoconservative movement.

Francis argued that the conservative movement was made of &quot;beautiful losers&quot;, being either &quot;rootless men&quot; attracted to archaic things or crypto-liberals who sometimes resist progressive change before eventually caving in. He argued that the political right kept losing because it was too focused on ideas and less on power. According to Francis, the political left has dominated politics due to the ascendancy of a progressive managerial class, leading to more bureaucratization and more state power while eroding the power of other authorities in society. To combat the emergence of this new class, Francis argued that the political right needed a base for its goals, this base being the white middle class or &quot;Middle American radicals.&quot; In order to capture this base for the political right, Francis argued in favor of emphasizing &quot;crime, educational collapse, the erosion of their economic status, and the calculated subversion of their social, cultural, and national identity&quot; to create a class identity for this group.

Writing in &quot;The Week&quot;, commentator Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote that Francis&#x27;s writings, and his rejection of movement conservatism, presaged the 2016 election of Donald Trump. In September 2017, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist David Brooks wrote: &quot;The only time I saw Sam Francis face-to-face — in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; cafeteria sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s — I thought he was a crank, but it&#x27;s clear now that he was at that moment becoming one of the most prescient writers of the past 50 years. There&#x27;s very little Donald Trump has done or said that Francis didn&#x27;t champion a quarter century ago.&quot; In 2023, historian Joshua Tait said that &quot;Before a Trump-inspired resurgence in interest in Francis, he was a cautionary tale from conservative intellectual history.&quot;

During the 2022 electoral cycle, Republican candidates Blake Masters and Joe Kent promoted Francis&#x27; writings.

Although Francis sometimes engaged with Christian thinkers and publications during his life, he was also harshly critical of Christianity in his later years and his worldview has been described as irreligious and materialistic. Francis wrote that &quot;Christianity today is the enemy of the West and the race that created it&quot; and suggested that the &quot;religious wrong&quot; operated under a &quot;false consciousness&quot; that prevented white Christians from recognizing their true interests. Because of this, he has been cited as part of a trend toward increasingly &quot;secular, even pagan&quot; ideas among certain segments of the American radical right.

<doc id="376192" wikidata="Q211111" url="?curid=376192" title="Ursula Andress">
<text>Ursula Andress (born 19 March 1936) is a Swiss actress and former model who has appeared in American, British, and Italian films. Her breakthrough role was as Bond girl Honey Ryder in the first James Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962). She later starred as Vesper Lynd in the 1967 Bond parody &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Other credits include &quot;Fun in Acapulco&quot; (1963), &quot;4 for Texas&quot; (1963), &quot;She&quot; (1965), &quot;The 10th Victim&quot; (1965), &quot;The Blue Max&quot; (1966), &quot;The Southern Star&quot; (1969), &quot;Perfect Friday&quot; (1970), &quot;Red Sun&quot; (1971), &quot;The Sensuous Nurse&quot; (1975), &quot;Slave of the Cannibal God&quot; (1978), &quot;The Fifth Musketeer&quot; (1979), &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (1981), and &quot;Peter the Great&quot; (1986).

== Early life==
Ursula Andress, the third of six children, was born on 19 March 1936 in Ostermundigen, Canton of Bern, to a Swiss mother, Anna, and Rolf Andress, a German diplomat. Her father was expelled from Switzerland for political reasons and her grandfather, a garden designer, became her guardian. She has a brother, Heinz, and four sisters, Erika, Charlotte, Gisela, and Kàtey.

Andress went to school in Bern until she was 16 and learned several languages, including English, French, German, and Italian. She studied art in Paris for a year, then went to Rome, where she worked various jobs including being a children’s nanny.

==Career==

Andress was at a party when she met a film producer who offered her a screen test for a role in an Italian film. She was successful and was cast in walk-on parts in &quot;An American in Rome&quot; (1954) (starring Alberto Sordi), &quot;The Sins of Casanova&quot; (1955) (starring later Bond ally Gabriele Ferzetti), and &quot;La catena dell&#x27;odio&quot; (1955). She was seen by a Hollywood executive who persuaded her to try her luck in Hollywood.

Andress arrived in Hollywood in late 1955. That spring she was signed to a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures, starting at $287 a week. The contract brought no acting roles, owing to her reluctance to learn English. &quot;I spent most of my time watching old Marlene Dietrich movies&quot;, she said. Andress received some publicity for dating James Dean shortly before the actor&#x27;s death. She bought herself out of her contract and in 1956 signed with Columbia Pictures. She made no films for them either. She stayed in Hollywood when she married John Derek in 1957. In 1959, it was announced she and Derek would star in a film, &quot;High Variety&quot;, but no film resulted. 

Andress returned to acting in 1962 in an episode of &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;La Strega&quot; (1962), with Alejandro Rey. She became internationally famous as Honey Ryder, a shell diver and James Bond&#x27;s object of desire in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), the first Bond film, even though her dialogue had to be dubbed by Nikki van der Zyl. In what became an iconic moment in cinematic and fashion history, she rose out of the Caribbean Sea in a white bikini sporting a large diving knife on her hip. The calypso singing her character did in that scene was dubbed by Diana Coupland. The scene made Andress a &quot;quintessential&quot; Bond girl. Andress later said that she owed her career to that white bikini: &quot;This bikini made me into a success. As a result of starring in &quot;Dr. No&quot; as the first Bond girl, I was given the freedom to take my pick of future roles and to become financially independent&quot;. The bikini she wore in the film sold at auction in 2001 for £41,125. In 2003, in a UK Survey by Channel 4, her entrance in &quot;Dr. No&quot; was voted #1 in &quot;the 100 Greatest Sexy Moments&quot;. Andress won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year in 1964 for her appearance in the film.

Andress followed it playing the female lead in an Elvis Presley musical, &quot;Fun in Acapulco&quot; (1963). She was billed after Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Anita Ekberg in &quot;4 for Texas&quot; (1963); her casting in the latter led to the title being changed from &quot;Two for Texas&quot;. Both films were widely seen. Less so was a film Andress starred in alongside Derek, &quot;Nightmare in the Sun&quot; (1965).

In 1965, nude photographs of her from &quot;Nightmare in the Sun&quot; were published in &quot;Playboy&quot;; it was the first of seven times she was pictured in the magazine over the next fifteen years. When asked why she had agreed to do the &quot;Playboy&quot; shoot, Andress replied coolly, &quot;Because I&#x27;m beautiful&quot;.

Andress was cast in the title role of &quot;She&quot; (1965), playing an immortal queen, for Hammer Films and Seven Arts Productions, shot in England and Israel. Andress agreed to make it as part of a two-picture deal with Seven Arts; it was a financial success at the box office. Andress did not appear in the sequel, &quot;The Vengeance of She&quot;, as her contract expired before the film was produced.

Andress had a supporting role in the comedy &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (1965) for producer Charles K. Feldman which was a huge hit. She went to France to play Jean-Paul Belmondo&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Up to His Ears&quot; (1965), which was popular in France; she and Belmondo became romantically involved, leading to her and Derek divorcing (although they had already been separated for a year). Andress moved to Paris to live with Belmondo and it was her home for the next seven years.

In Italy, she starred opposite Marcello Mastroianni in the science fiction movie &quot;The 10th Victim&quot; (1965). She returned to Hollywood to play George Peppard&#x27;s love interest in the World War One film &quot;The Blue Max&quot; (1966), another success at the box office.

Andress made her second film for Seven Arts: another with Derek, who again starred and directed, &quot;Once Before I Die&quot; (1966), shot in the Philippines. More widely seen was the Bond satire &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), also produced by Feldman, where Andress played Vesper Lynd, an occasional spy who persuades Evelyn Tremble, played by Peter Sellers, to carry out a mission. It was a big box office hit. Her fee was a reported £200,000. Val Guest directed Andress in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and said &quot;I don&#x27;t think I have ever met someone who was so universally loved by everyone in a studio. They&#x27;d all do anything for her and this is really quite something. One day someone is going to get the real Ursula on the screen in a comedy and she&#x27;s going to astound everybody. The trouble is that she&#x27;s so tense&quot;.

In Italy, she appeared alongside fellow former Bond girl Claudine Auger in &quot;Anyone Can Play&quot; (1968) for director Luigi Zampa. She then went to Africa to make &quot;The Southern Star&quot; (1969) with George Segal, which was a hit in England. She appeared nude or semi-nude in nearly all of her film roles between 1969 and 1979, earning her the nickname &quot;Ursula Undress&quot;.

Andress went to England to appear in &quot;Perfect Friday&quot; (1970), a heist film starring Stanley Baker and David Warner. In Spain, she appeared in &quot;Red Sun&quot; (1971), a Western with an international cast including Charles Bronson, Toshiro Mifune, and Alain Delon. In a 1972 interview, she said &quot;I think my image, especially to Americans, is that of a femme fatale, a man-eating woman. I&#x27;m not empty-headed or calculating and cool. But maybe my looks give that impression. I&#x27;m disciplined in my doings and undisciplined in my emotions. I can&#x27;t control the things I feel or hide my feelings&quot;.

Andress did some action films, &quot;Stateline Motel&quot; (1973), &quot;Loaded Guns&quot; (1975), and &quot;Africa Express&quot; (1975). She played the title role in &quot;The Sensuous Nurse&quot; (1975) and did a comedy with another former Bond girl, Barbara Bouchet, &quot;Spogliamoci così, senza pudor...&quot; (1976).

Andress played Joséphine de Beauharnais in the swashbuckling spoof &quot;The Loves and Times of Scaramouche&quot; (1976) with Michael Sarrazin. She made a sequel to &quot;Africa Express&quot;, &quot;Safari Express&quot; (1976), then did another with Mastroianni, &quot;Double Murder&quot; (1978).

== Personal life ==
Andress has stated that she lost her virginity to married actor Daniel Gélin in 1953, when she was 17 and he was 32. She dated Dennis Hopper and James Dean after moving to the US in 1955, and that same year began an affair with actor/director John Derek, a married father of two who walked out on his wife, Pati Behrs, and their family to be with 19-year-old Andress. Derek and Andress wed on 2 February 1957, in Las Vegas, but separated in 1964 over her affair with &quot;Once Before I Die&quot; co-star Ron Ely, officially divorcing in 1966. Prior to the finalization of her divorce, Andress publicly dated John Richardson, her co-star from &quot;She&quot;, and Marcello Mastroianni, her co-star from &quot;The 10th Victim&quot;.

From 1965 to 1972, Andress lived with her &quot;Up to His Ears&quot; co-star Jean-Paul Belmondo. She has stated that Belmondo was the love of her life. Her next live-in relationship was with another co-star, &quot;Stateline Motel&quot;″s Fabio Testi, from 1973 to 1977 (except for one year when they broke up). She also dated Ryan O&#x27;Neal, John Delorean, Helmut Berger, Paolo Pazzaglia, Johnny Dorelli, Franco Nero, with whom she later starred in &quot;Red Bells&quot;, Nels Van Patten, and Ricci Martin.

When Andress broke her arm in 1978, the official story was that she had been struck by Hurricane Norman while bodysurfing in Malibu, but it was rumored that she actually suffered the injury during a fight with her on-again/off-again boyfriend O&#x27;Neal. O&#x27;Neal and Andress were in a relationship twice, first from 1972 to 1973, then again from 1977 to 1978.

Andress lived with actor Harry Hamlin after meeting on the set of &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; in 1979. She gave birth to their son, Dimitri Alexander Hamlin, on 19 May 1980. The night of her delivery, Linda Evans drove Andress to the hospital while Evans&#x27; assistant Bunky Young retrieved Hamlin from the set of &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;. Although she was engaged to Hamlin, the couple never married. Hamlin ended their relationship in 1983.

In the mid-1980s, Andress was romantically involved with soccer player Paulo Roberto Falcão, actor Gerardo Amato, singer Julio Iglesias, real estate developer Stan Herman, and bodybuilder Mario Natokis. In 1986, she began dating future Sicilian Regional Assembly member Fausto Fagone, then a university student; he was 20 and she was 50. The relationship, which infuriated Fagone&#x27;s parents, lasted until 1991. Later that year, Andress briefly dated martial arts expert Jeff Speakman, but has not been publicly linked with anyone since.

<text>Canada&#x27;s contemporary theatre reflects a rich diversity of regional and cultural identities. Since the late 1960s, there has been a concerted effort to develop the voice of the &#x27;Canadian playwright&#x27;, which is reflected in the nationally focused programming of many of the country&#x27;s theatres. Within this &#x27;Canadian voice&#x27; are a plurality of perspectives - that of the First Nations, new immigrants, French Canadians, sexual minorities, etc. - and a multitude of theatre companies have been created to specifically service and support these voices.

==Early Canadian theatre==

The Annapolis Basin in Nova Scotia served as the cradle for both French and English language theatre in Canada. Théâtre de Neptune, performed in 1606, was the first European theatre production in North America.

The tradition of English theatre in Canada also started at Annapolis Royal. In Fort Anne, Nova Scotia, plays were produced for Prince of Wales&#x27; birthday. George Farquhar&#x27;s The Recruiting Officer was produced on Saturday, 20 January 1733 to celebrate the birthday of Frederick, Prince of Wales. When he was a Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, Paul Mascarene translated Molière&#x27;s French play &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; in to English and produced several plays in 1743 and 1744. An unknown play was also staged on 20 January 1748 for the Prince&#x27;s birthday, and it was restaged on 2 February 1748.

===Plays===

===Events===
Theatre was banned in French Canada by the Catholic clergy in 1694, but after Canada became British in 1763, theatrical activity begun to flourish, foremost among the British garrisons and within amateur theatre.

Antoine Foucher (1717-1801), of Terrebonne (father of Louis-Charles Foucher), was the owner of the first Francophone theatre in Canada. In 1774, with various British officers, he staged the first production of Molière at his home in Montreal. Other Garrison performances were private shows put on for troops, publicly performed by officers, which helped bridge theatre and war during its initial stages of development. It was welcomed by the populaces and distracted soldiers from war and routine military protocol.

The first professional theatre company was &quot;Allen&#x27;s Company of Comedians&quot;, which made its first performance in Montreal in 1786, and was followed by the all male French language amateur society &quot;Les Jeunes Messieurs Canadiens&quot; in Quebec City in 1789. From 1790 to 1840, amateur theatre was regularly performed at the Haymarket Theatre in Quebec City.

Officially opened on the 24th of June 1893 in Montreal, the Monument National is located at the historical interface between the Francophone neighbourhoods (to the east) and the Anglophone areas (to the west), it also found itself in the heart of the Jewish and Chinese sections on the most multiethnic street in the city.

Before 1825, the Hayes House Hotel on Dalhousie Square, Montreal, had a theatre that staged German Orchestras and held Viennese dances. After it burned it down, John Molson built the Theatre Royal in 1825, presenting Shakespeare and Restoration authors. It sat 1,000 guests and was also used for circuses and concerts. Edmund Kean and Charles Dickens both performed there before it was demolished in 1844 to make way for the Bonsecours Market.

In the West, the Grand Theatre was built in 1912 in Calgary by the visionary Sir James Lougheed. The Grand was the initial home of many arts organizations in Calgary; the first theatre, opera, ballet, symphony concerts, and movies were seen here. This theatre was the centre of social, cultural, and political life in Calgary until the early 1960s. The Grand Theatre has been saved from demolition in 2004 by the company Theatre Junction and its director Mark Lawes.

From 1929, Martha Allan founded the Montreal Repertory Theatre and later co-founded the Dominion Drama Festival. She loathed amateur theatre, but her energies spearheaded the Canadian Little Theatre Movement at a time when live theatre in Montreal and across Canada was being threatened by the rapid expansion of the American-influenced movie theatre. She almost single-handedly laid the groundwork for the development of the professional modern Canadian theatre scene.

===Events===
With Canada&#x27;s centennial in 1967 came a growing awareness of the need to cultivate a national cultural identity. Thus, the 1970s were marked by the establishment of multiple theatre institutions dedicated to the development and presentation of Canadian playwrights, such as Factory Theatre, Tarragon Theatre, and the Great Canadian Theatre Company. Theatre Passe Muraille, under Paul Thompson&#x27;s directorship in the 1970s, gained a national reputation for its distinctive style of collective creation with plays such as &quot;The Farm Show, 1837: The Farmer&#x27;s Revolt&quot; and &quot;I Love You, Baby Blue&quot;.

In 1971 a group of Canadian playwrights issued the Gaspé Manifesto as a call for at least one-half of the programing at publicly subsidized theatres to be Canadian content. The numerical goal was not achieved, but the following years saw an increase in Canadian content stage productions.

This decade also was a particularly significant for the rise of devised performance practices across the country, particularly in Vancouver through artists graduating from Simon Fraser University and the creation of the PuSh International Performing Arts Festival in 2006, as well as in Halifax with the founding of Zuppa Theatre. Devised and creation-based models of theatre-making continued to be underrepresented in the larger regional theatre system of the country.

<doc id="376209" wikidata="Q7641278" url="?curid=376209" title="Sunset High School (Beaverton, Oregon)">
<text>Sunset High School (SHS) is a public high school in Beaverton, Oregon, United States. The school currently offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. It opened in 1959 and is the second oldest of the six high schools in the Beaverton School District. Sunset&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Apollos.

==History==
The school opened in January 1959, initially with freshman and sophomore students only, adding juniors in the fall and its first senior class in September 1960.

Senator Robert F. Kennedy spoke at a student-organized mock Democratic Convention held at Sunset High School on May 17, 1968, less than three weeks before his assassination on June 5.

==Location==

Sunset High School is located in the predominantly unincorporated area known as Cedar Mill. Although it has always had a Portland street address, it has never actually been within the city of Portland proper. From 1959 to 1999, the school property was unincorporated land in Washington County, with it being in the Cedar Mill census-designated place as of the 1990 U.S. Census. In 1999 the Sunset High School grounds (including the adjacent swimming pool) were annexed by the city of Beaverton. Nevertheless, as of 2022 the school&#x27;s mailing address remains a &quot;Portland&quot; address, as is the case for almost all of Cedar Mill.

==Demographics==

As of 2021–22, 50.5% of students are white, 11.4% Hispanic or Latino, 27.3% Asian, 1.3% African American, 0.4% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 0.3% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 8.6% two or more races. The 2021–22 enrollment was 2,003.

==Academics==
In 1983, Sunset High School was honored in the Blue Ribbon Schools Program, the highest honor a school can receive in the United States.

In 2008, 84% of the school&#x27;s seniors received a high school diploma. Of 498 students, 409 graduated, 59 dropped out, five received a modified diploma, and 25 were still in high school in 2009.

<text>Jukka-Pekka Saraste (born 22 April 1956) is a Finnish conductor and violinist.

==Biography==
Saraste was born in Heinola, the son of teachers Kauko Pekka Saraste and Ritva Leena-Marjatta (Ruoranen) Saraste. He was trained as a violinist at the Conservatory of Music in Lahti (Lahden Musiikkiopisto) and later studied conducting at the Sibelius Academy with Jorma Panula in the same class as Esa-Pekka Salonen and Osmo Vänskä. Before becoming a conductor, Saraste was co-principal second violinist and later an associate to Leif Segerstam, with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra (RSO).

In 1983, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Saraste co-founded the Avanti! Chamber Orchestra, which specialises in performances of contemporary music. In 2000, Saraste also founded the Ekenäs Summer Concerts-Festival with the Finnish Chamber Orchestra, and he is currently the artistic advisor to both Festival and Orchestra. Saraste has directed the Finnish Chamber Orchestra on several tours, including tours in the United States and China.

In 1987, Saraste became the chief conductor of the RSO, and held the position until 2001. In 1987, he also became the principal conductor of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and remained with the orchestra until 1991. Saraste now holds the title of Conductor Laureate of the RSO. He has twice recorded the complete symphonies of Jean Sibelius with the RSO.

Saraste became Music Director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1994. The later years of his tenure were marked by strife over the orchestra&#x27;s financial difficulties, several musicians&#x27; strikes, and his unsuccessful efforts to improve the acoustics at Roy Thomson Hall. During the 1999 labour dispute, Saraste had offered to serve as mediator in the situation. Saraste stepped down from his Toronto post in 2001.

From 2002 to 2005, Saraste served as the principal guest conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In August 2006, he became Music Director of the Oslo Philharmonic, with an initial contract of 5 years. In June 2009, his Oslo contract was extended through the 2012–2013 season. He concluded his Oslo tenure after the 2012–2013 season. In December 2006, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra announced the appointment of Saraste as its artistic advisor from 2008 through 2011, and Artistic Director of the Lahti Sibelius Festival in 2008. In November 2008, the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne announced the appointment of Saraste as its next principal conductor, effective with the 2010–2011 season. He served in the post through the 2018–2019 season. In April 2022, the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra announced the appointment of Saraste as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2023–2024 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.

Saraste was awarded the Finnish State Prize for Music in 2000. He has received a Doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot; from York University (Toronto), and he is a Sibelius Medallist. Other honours also include the Sibelius Prize, awarded in Norway and the Pro Finlandia Medal. He received the Insignia of Commander of the Order of the Lion of Finland in 2023.

<doc id="376221" wikidata="Q245544" url="?curid=376221" title="Cyclone Tracy">
<text>Severe Tropical Cyclone Tracy was a small but destructive tropical cyclone that devastated the city of Darwin, in the Northern Territory of Australia, in December 1974. The small, developing, easterly storm was originally expected to pass clear of the city, but it turned towards it early on 24 December. After 10:00 p.m. ACST, damage became severe, with wind gusts reaching before instruments failed. The anemometer in Darwin Airport control tower had its needle bent in half by the strength of the gusts.

Residents of Darwin were celebrating Christmas, and they did not immediately acknowledge the emergency, partly because they had been alerted to an earlier cyclone (Selma) which passed west of the city, not affecting it in any way. Additionally, news outlets had only a skeleton crew on duty over the holiday.

Tracy killed 66 people and caused $837 million in damage (1974 AUD, about $ in 2022, approximately US$5.2 billion). It destroyed more than 70 percent of Darwin&#x27;s buildings, including 80 percent of houses. It left more than 25,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless prior to landfall and required the evacuation of over 30,000 people, of whom many never returned. After the storm passed, the city was rebuilt using more stringent standards &quot;to cyclone code&quot;. The storm is the second-smallest tropical cyclone on record (in terms of gale-force wind diameter), behind only the North Atlantic&#x27;s Tropical Storm Marco in 2008.

==Meteorological history==

On 20 December 1974, the United States&#x27; ESSA-8 environmental satellite recorded a large cloud mass centred over the Arafura Sea about northeast of Darwin. This disturbance was tracked by the Darwin Weather Bureau&#x27;s regional director Ray Wilkie, and by senior meteorologist Geoff Crane. On 21 December, the ESSA-8 satellite showed evidence of a newly formed circular centre near latitude 8° south and longitude 135° east. Crane - the meteorological duty officer at the time - issued the initial tropical cyclone alert, describing the storm as a tropical low that could develop into a tropical cyclone.

Later in the evening, the Darwin meteorological office received an infrared satellite image from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s satellite, NOAA-4, showing that the low pressure had developed further and that spiralling clouds could be observed. The storm was officially pronounced a tropical cyclone at around 10p.m. on 21 December, when it was around to the north-northeast of Cape Don ( northeast of Darwin). Cyclone Tracy was first observed on the Darwin radar on the morning of 22 December.

Over the next few days, the cyclone moved in a southwesterly direction, passing north of Darwin on 22 December. A broadcast on ABC Radio that day stated that Cyclone Tracy posed no immediate threat to Darwin. However, early in the morning of 24 December, Tracy rounded Cape Fourcroy on the western tip of Bathurst Island, and moved in a southeasterly direction, straight towards Darwin. The bureau&#x27;s weather station at Cape Fourcroy measured a mean wind speed of at 9:00 that morning.

By late afternoon on 24 December, the sky over the city was heavily overcast, with low clouds, and was experiencing strong rain. Wind gusts increased in strength; between 10p.m. (local time) and midnight, the damage became serious, and residents began to realise that the cyclone would not pass by the city, but over it. On 25 December at around 3:30a.m., Tracy&#x27;s centre crossed the coast near Fannie Bay. The highest recorded wind gust from the cyclone was , which was recorded around 3:05a.m. at Darwin Airport. The anemometer (wind speed instrument) failed at around 3:10a.m., with the wind vane (wind direction) destroyed after the cyclone&#x27;s eye passed over. The Bureau of Meteorology&#x27;s official estimates suggested that Tracy&#x27;s gusts had reached . The lowest air pressure reading during Tracy was , which was taken at around 4a.m., by a Bureau staff member at Darwin Airport. This was recorded during the eye of the cyclone. From around 6:30a.m., the winds began to ease, with the rainfall ceasing at around 8:30 a.m. After making landfall, Tracy rapidly weakened, dissipating on 26 December. Total rainfall in Darwin from Cyclone Tracy was at least .

==Preparations==
Darwin had been severely battered by cyclones before: in January 1897 and again in March 1937. However, in the 20 years leading up to Cyclone Tracy, the city had undergone a period of rapid expansion. E.P. Milliken estimated that on the eve of the cyclone there were 43,500 people living in 12,000 dwellings in the Darwin area. Though building standards at the time required that some attention be given to the possibility of cyclones, most buildings were not capable of withstanding the force of a cyclone&#x27;s direct hit.

On the day of the cyclone, most residents of Darwin believed that the cyclone would not cause any damage to the city. Cyclone Selma had been predicted to hit Darwin earlier in the month, but it instead went north and dissipated without affecting Darwin in any way. As a result, Cyclone Tracy took most Darwin residents by surprise. Despite several warnings, the people of Darwin did not evacuate or prepare for the cyclone. Many residents continued to prepare for Christmas, and many attended Christmas parties despite the increasing winds and heavy rain. Journalist Bill Bunbury interviewed the residents of Darwin sometime later and recorded the experiences of the survivors of the cyclone in his book &quot;Cyclone Tracy: Picking Up the Pieces&quot;. Resident Dawn Lawrie, a 1971 independent candidate for the electorate of Nightcliff, told him:

Another resident, Barbara Langkrens, said:
==Impact==

Cyclone Tracy destroyed about 80% of the Darwin city. 94% of housing was uninhabitable. At Darwin Airport, thirty-one aircraft were destroyed and another twenty-five badly damaged. 

=== Deaths ===
Cyclone Tracy killed 66 people on land and at sea. In the cyclone&#x27;s aftermath, the number of deaths reported varied from 49 to 66, as an official list of deaths was never compiled. Nearly thirty years later, the last two missing ships were located in Darwin Harbour, MV &quot;Booya&quot; in October 2003 and the ferry &quot;Darwin Princess&quot; in May 2004. Police divers investigated both wrecks and found no human remains but did retrieve some personal effects. In March 2005, the Northern Territory Coroner held an inquest into the people suspected to have died on board, declaring them deaths at sea. Following the inquest the death total was raised to 71 and this was widely published. However recent research by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory has determined that this figure includes five deaths that were double counted, reducing the overall total to 66. Of these, 45 died on land and 21 died at sea.

=== Reporting ===
Several factors delayed the dissemination of the news of the cyclone&#x27;s impact to the country. The intensity and track of the cyclone had destroyed virtually all telecommunication and radio equipment in the city, including the transmission equipment at both Royal Australian Navy bases HMAS &quot;Melville&quot; and HMAS &quot;Coonawarra&quot;. The first communication link reestablished in the aftermath was via HF Radio sourced from a Connellan Airways de Havilland Heron that had been hastily stored in an empty hangar at Darwin Airport the night before, being anchored to towing equipment and weighed down with of beer cartons. From this aircraft, pilot David Fredrickson contacted the Katherine Flight Service Center by mid-morning to convey news of the disaster. He then spent much of the day relaying messages on behalf of emergency services, Navy personnel and airport staff until additional communication links were established later in the day.

The destruction of transportation infrastructure and the distance between Darwin and the rest of the Australian population played a role in the delayed information dissemination, as did the fact the storm made landfall on Christmas Day and most media outlets only had a skeleton crew rostered on at best. Most Australians were not aware of the cyclone until late in the afternoon. Dick Muddimer, a reporter for the local ABC radio station, 8DR, credited as being the man who informed the rest of the nation about the cyclone, after finding out that the ABC&#x27;s studios on Cavenagh Street were completely knocked off transmission, was able to travel through the wreckage and the storm to the studios of the local television station NTD-8 to send a message to the ABC station in Mount Isa, Queensland, to notify ABC headquarters in Sydney that Darwin had been hit by a cyclone.

=== Governance ===
In order to provide the initial emergency response, a committee was created. The committee, composed of several high-level public servants and police, stated that, &quot;Darwin had, for the time being, ceased to exist as a city&quot;. Gough Whitlam, the Australian Prime Minister, was touring Syracuse, Sicily, at the time and flew to Darwin upon hearing of the disaster. Additionally, the Australian government began a mass evacuation by road and air; all of the Defence Force personnel throughout Australia, along with the entire Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s fleet of transport planes, were recalled from holiday leave and deployed to evacuate civilians from Darwin as well as to bring essential relief supplies to the area. Thirteen RAN ships were used to transport supplies to the area as part of Operation Navy Help Darwin, which is the largest humanitarian or disaster relief operation ever performed by the Royal Australian Navy.

===Health and essential services crisis===
As soon as the worst of the storm had passed, Darwin faced several immediate health crises. On Christmas Day, the Darwin Hospital treated well over five hundred patients, with 112 of these being admitted into the hospital, and both of the facility&#x27;s operating theatres being utilised. The first casualties did not arrive till 7a.m. because of high winds and severe road conditions in and around the Darwin area. Operating continued throughout the night and into the early morning. Local teams worked without relief until the arrival of a surgical team from Canberra late that day. Those who were considered unable to return to work within two weeks were evacuated by air to safer locations.

All official communications out of Darwin were no longer operational. The antennas at the OTC Coastal Radio Service station (callsign VID) were destroyed during the storm. Station manager Bob Hooper, who was an amateur radio operator, helped to establish communications using his own equipment. By 10a.m., Gary Gibson, another amateur operator, was able to establish a station at the Darwin Community College, and within a short period of time, a network of stations was established across the country. This network, coordinated by Melbourne D24 police, provided message services to the cities of Perth, Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, Townsville, Brisbane, Adelaide, Alice Springs, Gove, Mt Isa, Cairns, Rockhampton, Mackay, Lismore, and Cooma. By 10:40a.m., VID operators had established VID2 on board MV &quot;Nyanda&quot; in Darwin Harbour, and then for five days official communications traffic in and out of Darwin was handled via continuous wave radio (Morse code). The only local radio station that was not completely disabled was the ABC&#x27;s 8DR. For the next two days, it was Darwin&#x27;s only link to the outside world and was on the air for all but 34 hours in the coming weeks.

Those who remained in Darwin faced the threat of several diseases due to much of the city being without water, electricity, or basic sanitation. An initial response was to vaccinate residents for typhoid and cholera. Approximately 30,000 people were homeless and were forced to seek shelter in several makeshift housing and emergency centres that lacked proper hygienic conditions. Volunteers came in from across the country to assist with the emergency relief efforts. Trench latrines were dug, water supplies delivered by tankers, and mass immunisation programs begun. The army was given the task of searching houses for bodies of people and animals, as well as locating other health risks; for example, cleaning out rotting contents from fridges and freezers across the city. This was completed within a week. Houses which had been &quot;searched and cleared&quot; had S&amp;C painted on an external wall. The city itself was sprayed with malathion to control mosquitoes and other similar pests.

Attempts to reconnect the essential services to the city began on Christmas Day. Local officers from the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction began clearing debris and working to restore power. They sealed off damaged water hydrants and activated pumps to reactivate the city&#x27;s water and sewerage systems.

===Evacuation and the public response===
Major-General Alan Stretton, Director-General of the Natural Disasters Organization, and the commonwealth minister for the Northern Territory, Rex Patterson, arrived at Darwin Airport late on Christmas Day and took charge of the relief efforts. After an assessment of the situation and meetings with the Department of the Northern Territory and the relevant minister, it was concluded that Darwin&#x27;s population needed to be reduced to a &quot;safe level&quot; of 10,500 people. This decision was made on the advice of Dr. Charles Gurd, the Director of Health in the Northern Territory. Around 10,000 people left Darwin and the surrounding area within the first two days, but the rate of departures then began to slow down. The government then gave support to his position, offering full reimbursement of personal costs, as long as the evacuation took place.

The population was evacuated by air and ground; because of communications difficulties with Darwin airport, landing was limited to one plane every ninety minutes. At major airports, teams of federal and territory department officials as well as Salvation Army and Red Cross workers met refugees, with the Red Cross taking responsibility for keeping track of the names and temporary addresses of the refugees. Evacuations were prioritised according to need; women, children, the elderly, and the sick were evacuated first. There were reports of men dressing up as women to escape with the early evacuations. Between 26 and 31 December, a total of 35,362 people were evacuated from Darwin. Of those, 25,628 were evacuated by air, the remainder by road.

Most evacuation flights were conducted onboard commercial aircraft sent by Ansett, TAA, MMA and Qantas, with a majority of these flights being filled to upwards of 150% their normal passenger capacity. One particular evacuation flight, a Qantas Boeing 747-238B (VH-EBB) departed Darwin on 28 December with a record breaking 673 evacuees on board. By 31 December, only 10,638 people (mostly men who were required to help clean up the city) remained in Darwin. Stretton also regulated access to the city by means of a permit system. Permits were issued only to those who were involved in either the relief or reconstruction efforts, and were used to prevent the early return of those who had been evacuated.

Upon receiving news of the damage, several community groups across Australia began fundraising and relief efforts to assist the survivors. Major reception centres were set up in cities such as Katherine, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs. Several of the small towns along the Stuart Highway made efforts to assist people who were fleeing by road, supplying them with food, fuel, rest, and mechanical aid. At Adelaide River, the small local population provided hot meals to the refugees who stopped there. Approximately 24 hours after the storm hit Darwin, the population of Alice Springs had raised over $105,000 (~A$665,000 in 2022 terms) to assist the victims of Tracy. In Melbourne at the Boxing Day Test cricket match between Australia and England, members of both teams moved around the boundaries carrying buckets which the crowd threw cash into for the relief funds. Darwin families were also given priority on public housing waiting lists. On 31 December 1974, Stretton recommended that full civilian control should resume in Darwin, and handed over control of the city to its elected officials.

==Aftermath==
===Reconstruction and effects on Darwin===

In February 1975, Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam announced the creation of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, which was given the task of rebuilding the city &quot;within five years&quot;, focusing primarily on building houses. The commission was headed by Tony Powell. The damage to the city was so severe that some advocated moving the entire city. However, the government insisted that it be rebuilt in the same location. By May 1975, Darwin&#x27;s population had recovered somewhat, with 30,000 residing in the city. Temporary housing, caravans, hotels, and an ocean liner (MV &quot;Patris&quot;), were used to house people, because reconstruction of permanent housing had not yet begun by September that year. Ella Stack became Mayor of Darwin in May 1975 and was heavily involved in its reconstruction.

However, by the following April, and after receiving criticism for the slow speed of reconstruction, the commission had built 3,000 new homes in the nearly destroyed northern suburbs, and completed repairs to those that had survived the storm. Several new building codes were drawn up, trying to achieve the competing goals of the speedy recovery of the area and ensuring that there would be no repeat of the damage that Darwin took in 1974. By 1978, much of the city had recovered and was able to house almost the same number of people as it had before the cyclone hit. However, by the 1980s, as many as sixty percent of Darwin&#x27;s 1974 population had left, never to return. In the years that followed, Darwin was almost entirely rebuilt and now shows almost no resemblance to the pre-Tracy Darwin of December 1974.

Although a Legislative Assembly had been set up earlier in the year, the Northern Territory had only minimal self-government, with a federal minister being responsible for the Territory from Canberra. However, the cyclone and subsequent responses highlighted several problems with the way the regional government was set up. This led Malcolm Fraser, Whitlam&#x27;s successor as Prime Minister, to give self-government to the Territory in 1978.

Many of the government records associated with Cyclone Tracy became publicly available on 1 January 2005 under the 30-year rule.

On 25 December 2024the 50th anniversary a memorial was unveiled at East Point Reserve, where the cyclone made landfall. The memorial includes individual plaques with the names of the deceased.

===In popular culture===
Cyclone Tracy inspired the song &quot;Santa Never Made It into Darwin&quot;, composed by Bill Cate and performed by Bill and Boyd in 1975 to raise money for the relief and reconstruction efforts. In 1983, Hoodoo Gurus released &quot;Tojo&quot;, a song comparing the Japanese bombing of Darwin under the command of Hideki Tojo during World War II to the damage done by Cyclone Tracy. The much-feared Japanese invasion never happened, but the cyclone was virtually ignored and ended up destroying the city. In May 1976, Australian band Ayers Rock released the single &quot;Song for Darwin&quot;, also as a fundraiser for the relief and reconstruction efforts.

In 1986, the Nine Network and PBL created &quot;Cyclone Tracy&quot;, a period drama mini-series based on the events during the cyclone. Michael Fisher, Ted Roberts and Leon Saunders wrote the series, and it also starred Chris Haywood and Tracy Mann, who played the lead characters of Steve and Connie. The mini-series was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in December 2005. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as newsreel footage of the devastation and a documentary titled &quot;On A Wind and a Prayer&quot;.

==Records and meteorological statistics==
Tracy is the most compact cyclone or equivalent-strength hurricane on record in the Australian basin and Southern Hemisphere, with gale-force winds extending only from the centre, and was also the smallest tropical cyclone worldwide until 2008, when Tropical Storm Marco of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season broke the record, with gale-force winds extending only from the centre. After forming over the Arafura Sea, the storm moved southwards and affected the city with Category 4 winds on the Australian cyclone intensity scale, while there is evidence to suggest that it had reached Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale when it made landfall. Bruce Stannard of &quot;The Age&quot; stated that Cyclone Tracy was a &quot;disaster of the first magnitude ... without parallel in Australia&#x27;s history.&quot;

== Pressure estimates ==
David Longshore, in the book &quot;Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones&quot; 1992 and 2008 edition, states that Tracy&#x27;s barometric pressure was as low as 914 mbar, but the actual lowest pressure was 950 mbar. This information was recorded by a Bureau of Meteorology staff member at the Darwin airport.

<doc id="376222" wikidata="Q364517" url="?curid=376222" title="Henry I, Count of Champagne">
<text>Henry I (December 1127 – 16 March 1181), known as the Liberal, was count of Champagne from 1152 to 1181. He was the eldest son of Count Theobald II of Champagne, who was also count of Blois, and his wife, Matilda of Carinthia.

==Biography==
Henry took part in the Second Crusade under the leadership of Louis VII of France. He carried a letter of recommendation from Bernard of Clairvaux addressed to Manuel I Komnenos, Byzantine Emperor; he is listed among the notables present at the assembly held by Baldwin III of Jerusalem at Acre on 24 June 1148.

On his father&#x27;s death, Henry chose to take Champagne, leaving the family&#x27;s older holdings (including Blois, Chartres, Sancerre, and Châteaudun) to his younger brothers. At the time this may have been surprising, for the other territories were richer and better developed. Henry must have foreseen the economic possibilities of Champagne, and it is during his rule that the county achieved its high place as one of the richest and strongest of the French principalities.

Henry established orderly rule over the nobles of Champagne, and could fairly reliably count on the aid of some 2,000 vassals, which just by itself made him a power few in France could equal. This order in turn made Champagne a safe place for merchants to gather, and under the count&#x27;s protection, the Champagne Fairs became a central part of long-distance trade and finance in medieval Europe.

In addition, the count&#x27;s court in Troyes became a renowned literary center. Walter Map was among those who found hospitality there. The scholar Stephen of Alinerre was among Henry&#x27;s courtiers, becoming chancellor of the county in 1176.

In 1179, Henry went to Jerusalem again with a party of French knights including his relatives Peter of Courtenay (brother of Louis VII) and Philip of Dreux, bishop of Beauvais. He may have assisted to the wedding of his niece, Agnes, in Constantinople, as she wed Alexios Komnemos at the same date. Henry returned towards Europe by the land route across Asia Minor, and was captured and held to ransom by Kilij Arslan II, Seljuk sultan of Rüm. The ransom was paid by the Byzantine Emperor. Henry died on 16 March 1181.
In 1164, Henry married Marie of France, daughter of Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

They had four children:

* Scholastique of Champagne (died 1219), married William IV of Mâcon
* Henry II (1166–1197)
* Marie of Champagne (died 1204), married Baldwin I of Constantinople
* Theobald III of Champagne (1179–1201)

Henry built the collegiate church of Saint-Étienne in Troyes between 1157 and 1171, which he planned as a necropolis for the House of Blois. He was buried there, as was his son Theobald III, but most of his descendants were buried elsewhere.

He was succeeded by their elder son Henry. After Henry became king of Jerusalem his younger brother, Theobald, became count.

<text>Melvin Howard Tormé (September 13, 1925 – June 5, 1999), nicknamed &quot;the Velvet Fog&quot;, was an American musician, singer, composer, arranger, drummer, actor, and author. He composed the music for &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; (&quot;Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;) and co-wrote the lyrics with Bob Wells. Tormé won two Grammy Awards and was nominated a total of 14 times.

==Early life and education==
Melvin Howard Tormé was born in Chicago, Illinois, to William David Tormé (born Wowe Torma, also spelled as Tarme or Tarmo), a Polish Jewish immigrant from Brest (now Belarus), and Sarah &quot;Betty&quot; Tormé (&quot;née&quot; Sopkin), a New York City native. Named after the actor Melvyn Douglas, Tormé grew up in a home filled with music and entertainment. His father, whom he recalled as having the pure voice of a cantor, had been an amateur dancer in his youth. His aunt Faye Tormé had risen to local fame in Chicago, where, dubbed the &quot;Wonder Frisco Dancer,&quot; she raised money by dancing at war bond rallies in 1917–8. Mel&#x27;s only formal musical education came from his Uncle Al Tormé, who played the ukulele and the Albert system clarinet. His only sibling, Myrna, was born a few weeks before his fourth birthday. 

Tormé grew up in a largely Black neighborhood and was heavily influenced by jazz. A child prodigy, he first performed professionally at age four with the Coon-Sanders Orchestra, singing &quot;You&#x27;re Driving Me Crazy,&quot; a song he had learned on the radio, at Chicago&#x27;s Blackhawk restaurant. He was invited back and sang every Monday night for six months; he was paid $15 a night with a free dinner for his family.

By 1931, during the Great Depression, his father had lost his store and began work as a salesman, while his mother worked as a seamstress. The family moved to the South Side to live with his grandparents. His grandmother hired a black woman named Alberta to look after Mel and his sister during the day. On Friday and Saturday nights, Alberta played piano in a five-piece jazz band at the famed Savoy Ballroom. Tormé later recalled of Alberta, &quot;She had it all, the syncopation, the jazz conception, the deep feeling in her singing, the deliciously dissonant chords she played. She exposed me to all of it, and I ingested her musicality by some process of osmosis.&quot;

To contribute to the family, he played drums in the drum-and-bugle corps at Shakespeare Elementary School. From 1933 to 1941, he acted in the radio programs &quot;The Romance of Helen Trent&quot; and &quot;Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy&quot;. He wrote his first song at 13. Three years later his first published song, &quot;Lament to Love&quot;, became a hit for bandleader Harry James. 

He graduated from Hyde Park High School.

==Career==
===Jazz music===
From 1942 to 1943, he was a member of a band led by Chico Marx of the Marx Brothers. He was the singer and drummer and also created some arrangements. In 1943, Tormé made his movie debut in Frank Sinatra&#x27;s first film, the musical &quot;Higher and Higher&quot;. His appearance in the 1947 film musical &quot;Good News&quot; made him a teen idol.

In 1944, he formed the vocal quintet Mel Tormé and His Mel-Tones, modeled on Frank Sinatra and The Pied Pipers. The Mel-Tones, which included Les Baxter and Ginny O&#x27;Connor, had several hits fronting Artie Shaw&#x27;s band and on their own, including Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot; The Mel-Tones were among the first jazz-influenced vocal groups, blazing a path later followed by The Hi-Lo&#x27;s, The Four Freshmen, The Singers Unlimited, and The Manhattan Transfer.

Tormé was discharged from the United States Army in 1946 and soon returned to a life of radio, TV, movies, and music. In 1947, he started a solo singing career. His appearances at New York&#x27;s Copacabana led local disc jockey Fred Robbins to give him the nickname “the Velvet Fog” in honor of his high tenor and smooth vocal style. Tormé detested the nickname. He self-deprecatingly referred to it as &quot;this Velvet Frog voice&quot;. As a solo singer, he recorded several romantic hits for Decca and with the Artie Shaw Orchestra for Musicraft (1946–1948). In 1949, he moved to Capitol, where his first record, &quot;Careless Hands&quot;, became his only number-one hit. His versions of &quot;Again&quot; and &quot;Blue Moon&quot; became signature songs. His composition &quot;California Suite&quot;, prompted by Gordon Jenkins&#x27;s &quot;Manhattan Tower&quot;, became Capitol&#x27;s first 12-inch LP album. Around this time, he helped pioneer cool jazz. 

His radio program, &quot;Mel Tormé Time&quot;, appeared on the short-lived Progressive Broadcasting System in the 1950s.

From 1955 to 1957, he recorded seven vocal jazz albums for Red Clyde&#x27;s Bethlehem Records, all with groups led by Marty Paich, most notably &quot;Mel Tormé and the Marty Paich Dek-Tette&quot;. He became known for his arranging skills, earning the respect of musicians.

In his 1994 book &quot;My Singing Teachers&quot;, Tormé cited Patty Andrews, lead singer of the Andrews Sisters, one of the most successful show business acts of the 1940s, as one of his favorite vocalists, saying: They had more hit records to their credit than you could count, and one of the main reasons for their popularity was Patty Andrews. She stood in the middle of her sisters, planted her feet apart, and belted out solos as well as singing the lead parts with zest and confidence. The kind of singing she did cannot be taught, it can&#x27;t be studied in books, it can&#x27;t be written down. Long experience as a singer and wide-open ears were her only teachers, and she learned her lessons well.

Though he spent most of his career singing jazz, Tormé had a deep appreciation for classical music, especially that of Frederick Delius and Percy Grainger. Rock and roll he considered &quot;three-chord manure&quot;.

In the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, Tormé covered pop tunes of the day, never staying long with one label. He had two minor hits: his 1956 recording of &quot;Mountain Greenery&quot;, which did better in the United Kingdom where it reached No. 4; and his 1962 R&amp;B song &quot;Comin&#x27; Home Baby&quot;, arranged by Claus Ogerman, which reached No. 13 in the UK. The latter recording led the jazz and gospel singer Ethel Waters to say that &quot;Tormé is the only white man who sings with the soul of a black man.&quot; &quot;Comin&#x27; Home Baby&quot; was later covered by Quincy Jones and Kai Winding.

===Television===
In 1960, Tormé appeared in the TV crime drama &quot;Dan Raven&quot; with Don Dubbins. He had a role in a cross-cultural western titled &quot;Walk Like a Dragon&quot;, starring Jack Lord. He played &quot;The Deacon&quot;, a bible-quoting gunfighter who protects a female saloon owner and teaches a young Chinese man the art of the fast draw. In one scene, he tells a soon-to-be victim: &quot;Say your prayers, brother Masters. You&#x27;re a corpse,&quot; then delivers on the promise. Like Sammy Davis Jr. and Robert Fuller, Tormé was a real-life fast draw expert. He also sang the show&#x27;s theme song.

In 1963–1964, Tormé wrote songs and arrangements for &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;, where he made three guest appearances. When he and Garland had a dispute, he was fired. A few years later, after Garland&#x27;s death, his time with her show became the subject of his first book, &quot;The Other Side of the Rainbow with Judy Garland on the Dawn Patrol&quot; (1970). Although the book was praised, some felt it painted an excessively unflattering picture of Garland and that Tormé had exaggerated his contributions to the program; it led to an unsuccessful lawsuit by Garland&#x27;s family.

In 1967, he appeared with Lucille Ball in a two-part episode of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; — &quot;Main Street U.S.A.&quot; — as Mel Tinker, a songwriter who hopes to preserve the character of his small town. Tormé also wrote the song that gave the episode its title, and performs it with Ball.

Tormé made nine guest appearances as himself (and one as a guardian angel) on the 1980s situation comedy &quot;Night Court&quot;. The main character, Judge Harry Stone, played by Harry Anderson, was depicted as an unabashed Tormé fan, an admiration that Anderson shared in real life; he would deliver the eulogy at Tormé&#x27;s funeral. Tormé appeared in Mountain Dew commercials and in a 1995 episode of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (&quot;The Jimmy&quot;) as himself. He recorded a version of Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;Straighten Up and Fly Right&quot; with his son, singer Steve March-Tormé. He worked with his other son, television writer-producer Tracy Tormé, on &quot;Sliders&quot;. The 1996 episode, entitled &quot;Greatfellas,&quot; featured Tormé as a version of himself from a parallel universe in which he is a country music singer who is also an FBI informant.

In the 1988 Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;The Night of the Living Duck&quot;, Daffy Duck has to sing in front of several monsters but lacks a good singing voice, so he inhales a substance called &quot;Eau de Tormé&quot; and sings like Mel Tormé, who provided the vocals.

On December 31, 1988, Tormé hosted a two-hour variety show titled &quot;Happy New Year, U. S. A.&quot; on PBS television.
===Resurgence===
The resurgence of vocal jazz in the 1970s resulted in a successful period for Tormé. His live performances restored his reputation as a jazz singer. He performed as often as 200 times a year in venues all over the world. In 1976, he won an Edison Award (the Dutch equivalent of the Grammy) for best male singer, and a &quot;DownBeat&quot; award for best male jazz singer. For several years, his appearances at Michael&#x27;s Pub on the Upper East Side would unofficially open New York&#x27;s fall cabaret season.

During the 1980s and 1990s he performed often with George Shearing, recording six albums together for Concord Records. About this period Shearing wrote:

It is impossible to imagine a more compatible musical partner... I humbly put forth that Mel and I had the best musical marriage in many a year. We literally breathed together during our countless performances. As Mel put it, we were two bodies of one musical mind.

He reunited with Marty Paich for a tour and the albums &quot;Mel Tormé and the Marty Paich Dektette – In Concert Tokyo&quot; and &quot;Mel Tormé and the Marty Paich Dektette – Reunion&quot;. He performed with Rob McConnell&#x27;s big band and recorded &quot;Mel Tormé, Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass&quot;. In 1995 he toured with Ken Peplowski. For much of the later period of his career, Mel&#x27;s trio was composed of John Colianni, piano; John Leitham, bass; and Donny Osborne, drums. With this group, Tormé recorded six albums and toured internationally. In some instances, Mel and this group were joined by Doc Severinsen and his Orchestra, Maureen McGovern, and Cleo Laine/John Dankworth. Guest conductors on symphonic gigs included Bob Krogstad and Keith Lockhart.

Tormé made a guest vocal appearance on the 1983 album &quot;Born to Laugh at Tornadoes&quot; by the progressive pop band Was (Not Was). Tormé sang the satiric jazz song &quot;Zaz Turned Blue&quot; about a teenager who is choked as part of an erotic asphyxiation (&quot;Steve squeezed his neck/He figured what the heck&quot;) – and who may or may not have suffered brain damage as a result (&quot;Now he plays lots of pool/And as a rule/He wears a silly grin/On his chin&quot;).

In 1991 Tormé published &quot;Traps, the Drum Wonder&quot;, a biography of drummer Buddy Rich, who was his friend since Rich left the Marines in 1944. He also owned and played a drum set that drummer Gene Krupa used for many years. George Spink, treasurer of the Jazz Institute of Chicago from 1978 - 1981, recalled that Tormé played this drum set at the 1979 Chicago Jazz Festival with Benny Goodman on &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot;.

===Writing, songwriting and recordings===
Tormé&#x27;s books include &quot;The Other Side of the Rainbow&quot; (1970), a memoir of his time as musical adviser for Judy Garland&#x27;s television show; &quot;Traps, the Drum Wonder&quot; (1991), a biography of Buddy Rich; &quot;My Singing Teachers: Reflections on Singing Popular Music&quot; (1994); &quot;Wynner&quot; (1978) a novel; and &quot;It Wasn&#x27;t All Velvet&quot; (1988), his autobiography.

Tormé wrote more than 250 songs, several of which became standards. He often wrote the arrangements for the songs he sang. He collaborated with Bob Wells on his most popular composition, &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; (1946); they wrote the song on a swelteringly hot and sunny day in California, sitting down and coming up with all the most &#x27;mid-wintery&#x27; things they could think of, in an attempt to cool themselves down; it was recorded first by Nat King Cole. Tormé said that he wrote the music in 45 minutes and that it was not one of his favorites, calling it &quot;my annuity&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mel Tormé was married four times, first to Candy Toxton (1949-1955); second to Arlene Miles (1956-1965); third to Janette Scott, Thora Hird&#x27;s daughter (1966-1977); and last to Ali Severson (from 1984 to his death in 1999). All his marriages except the last one ended in divorce. Tormé was survived by his wife Ali; five children: Steve March-Tormé, Melissa Torme-March, and Tracy, Daisy, and James Tormé; and two stepchildren: Carrie Tormé and Kurt. Tracy was a screenwriter and producer. James Tormé is a jazz vocalist based in Los Angeles, California. Steve March-Tormé is also a musician who lives and works in Appleton, Wisconsin.

===Illness and death===

On August 8, 1996, a stroke ended Tormé&#x27;s 65-year singing career. In February 1999, he was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He died from another stroke on June 5, 1999, at the age of 73. He is buried at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. In his eulogistic essay, John Andrews wrote:

<doc id="376228" wikidata="Q13014087" url="?curid=376228" title="The Matrix (franchise)">
<text>The Matrix is an American cyberpunk media franchise consisting of four feature films, beginning with &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) and continuing with three sequels, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; (both 2003), and &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; (2021). The first three films were written and directed by the Wachowskis and produced by Joel Silver. The screenplay for the fourth film was written by Lana Wachowski, David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon, was directed by Lana Wachowski, and was produced by Grant Hill, James McTeigue, and Lana Wachowski. The franchise is owned by Warner Bros., which distributed the films along with Village Roadshow Pictures. The latter, along with Silver Pictures, are the two production companies that worked on the first three films.

The series features a cyberpunk story of the technological fall of humanity, in which the creation of artificial intelligence led the way to a race of powerful and self-aware machines that imprisoned humans in a neural interactive simulation — the Matrix — to be farmed as a power source. Occasionally, some of the prisoners manage to break free from the system and, considered a threat, become pursued by the artificial intelligence both inside and outside of it. The films focus on the plight of Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) trying to free humanity from the system while pursued by its guardians, such as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, Abdul-Mateen II, and Jonathan Groff). The story references numerous norms, particularly philosophical, religious, and spiritual ideas, but also the dilemma of choice vs. control, the brain in a vat thought experiment, messianism, and the concepts of interdependency and love. Influences include the principles of mythology, anime, and Hong Kong action films (particularly &quot;heroic bloodshed&quot; and martial arts movies). The film series is notable for its use of heavily choreographed action sequences and &quot;bullet time&quot; slow-motion effects, which revolutionized action films to come.

The characters and setting of the films are further explored in other media set in the same fictional universe, including animation, comics, and video games. The comic &quot;Bits and Pieces of Information&quot; and the &quot;Animatrix&quot; short film &quot;The Second Renaissance&quot; act as prequels to the films, explaining how the franchise&#x27;s setting came to be. The video game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; connects the story of the &quot;Animatrix&quot; short &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; with the events of &quot;Reloaded&quot;, while the online video game &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; was a direct sequel to &quot;Revolutions&quot;. These were typically written, commissioned, or approved by the Wachowskis.

The first film was an important critical and commercial success, winning four Academy Awards, introducing popular culture symbols such as the red pill and blue pill, and influencing action filmmaking. For those reasons, it has been added to the National Film Registry for preservation. Its first sequel was also a commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing R-rated film in history, until it was surpassed by &quot;Deadpool&quot; in 2016. As of 2006, the franchise has generated US$3 billion in revenue. A fourth film, &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, was released on December 22, 2021, with Lana Wachowski producing, cowriting, and directing and Reeves and Moss reprising their roles. A fifth film is currently in development with Drew Goddard set to write and direct with Lana Wachowski executive producing.

==Setting==

The series depicts a future in which Earth is dominated by a race of self-aware machines that was spawned from the creation of artificial intelligence early in the 21st century. At one point conflict arose between humanity and machines, and the machines rebelled against their creators. Humans attempted to block out the machines&#x27; source of solar power by covering the sky in thick, stormy clouds. A massive war emerged between the two adversaries which ended with the machines victorious, capturing humanity. Having lost their definite source of energy, the machines devised a way to extract the human body&#x27;s bioelectric and thermal energies by enclosing people in pods, while their minds are controlled by cybernetic implants connecting them to a simulated reality called The Matrix.

The virtual reality world simulated by the Matrix resembles human civilization around the turn of the 21st century (this time period was chosen because it is supposedly the pinnacle of human civilization). The environment inside the Matrix – called a &quot;residual self-image&quot; (the mental projection of a digital self) – is practically indistinguishable from reality (although scenes set within the Matrix are presented on-screen with a green tint to the footage, and a general bias towards the color green), and the vast majority of humans connected to it are unaware of its true nature. Most of the central characters in the series are able to gain superhuman abilities within the Matrix by taking advantage of their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its virtual physical laws. The films take place both inside the Matrix and outside of it, in the real world; the parts that take place in the Matrix are set in a vast Western megacity.

The virtual world is first introduced in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The short comic &quot;Bits and Pieces of Information&quot; and the &quot;Animatrix&quot; short film &quot;The Second Renaissance&quot; show how the initial conflict between humanity and machines came about, and how and why the Matrix was first developed. Its history and purpose are further explained in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. In &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; a new status quo is established in the Matrix&#x27;s place in humankind and machines&#x27; conflict. This was further explored in &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;, a now-defunct MMORPG.

=== Future ===
During production of the original trilogy, the Wachowskis told their close collaborators that, &quot;at that time they had no intention of making another &quot;Matrix&quot; film after &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;&quot;. In February 2015, in promotion interviews for &quot;Jupiter Ascending&quot;, Lilly Wachowski called a return to &quot;The Matrix&quot; &quot;a particularly repelling idea in these times&quot;, noting studios&#x27; tendencies to &quot;greenlight&quot; sequels, reboots, and adaptations, in preference to original material. Meanwhile, Lana Wachowski, in addressing rumors about a potential reboot, stated that &quot;...they had not heard anything, but she believed that the studio might be looking to replace them&quot;. At various times, Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving each confirmed their interest and willingness to reprise their roles in potential future installments of the &quot;Matrix&quot; films, with the stipulation that the Wachowskis were involved in the creative and production process. These comments were made prior to the announcement in August 2019 that Lana Wachowski would direct a fourth &quot;Matrix&quot; film ultimately titled &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;Resurrections&quot;, producer James McTeigue said that there were no plans for further &quot;Matrix&quot; films, though he believed that the film&#x27;s open ending meant that could change in the future. In April 2024, it was announced that Warner Bros. was developing a new installment in the franchise with Drew Goddard attached to write and direct following a successful pitch with studio executives. It will mark the first installment to not be directed by either Wachowski sister although Lana will serve as an executive producer.

====Other projects====
In March 2017, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that Warner Bros. was in the early stages of developing a re-launch of the franchise. Consideration was given to producing a &quot;Matrix&quot; television series, but was dismissed as the studio opted to pursue negotiations with Zak Penn in writing a treatment for a new film, with Michael B. Jordan eyed for the lead role. According to the article, the Wachowskis were not involved at that point. In response to the report, Penn refuted all statements regarding a reboot, remake, or continuation, remarking that he was working on stories set in the pre-established continuity.

Potential plotlines being considered by Warner Bros. Pictures included a prequel film about a young Morpheus, or an alternate storyline with a focus on one of his descendants. By April 2018, Penn described the script as &quot;being at a nascent stage&quot;. Later, in September 2019, Jordan addressed the rumors of his involvement by saying he was &quot;flattered&quot;, but without making a definitive statement. In October 2019, Penn confirmed the script he wrote is set within an earlier time period than the first three films in the franchise.

==Cast and crew==
===Cast===


===Crew===
The following is a list of crew members who have participated in the making of the &quot;Matrix&quot; film series.

==Production==
The &quot;Matrix&quot; series includes four feature films. The first three were written and directed by the Wachowskis and produced by Joel Silver, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving. The series was filmed in Australia and began with 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Matrix&quot;, which depicts the recruitment of hacker Neo into humanity&#x27;s rebellion against sentient machines.

The film&#x27;s mainstream success had backed up the initial idea of making a trilogy. The sequels, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, were filmed simultaneously during one shoot (under the project codename &quot;The Burly Man&quot;), and released in two parts in 2003. They tell the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of Zion by a vast machine army. Neo also learns more about the history of the Matrix and his role as The One. The sequels also incorporate more ambitious action scenes and visual effects.

==Reception==
===Box office performance===
&quot;The Matrix&quot; was highly successful, earning over $460 million worldwide on a modest budget of $63 million. The sequels had a much larger budget of $150 million each; &quot;Reloaded&quot; was also a big commercial success, earning almost $742 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing R-rated film in history, a title which it held for 13 years until it was surpassed by the film &quot;Deadpool&quot;; &quot;Revolutions&quot; had the world&#x27;s first simultaneous release across major cities all over the world, which for the first time in history included both a release in China, and a release in IMAX theaters. Its five-day opening at $204 million broke the previous record, but ultimately the film made $427 million, a little less than the original.

===Critical and public response===

&quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; received positive reviews, the critical response to &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; was more negative. One complaint was that &quot;Revolutions&quot; did not give answers to the questions raised in &quot;Reloaded&quot;.

===Accolades===
===Legal claims===
In April 2003, Sophia Stewart filed a legal complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that the idea of &quot;The Matrix&quot; (and the 1984 film &quot;The Terminator&quot;) were plagiarized from her own film treatment titled &quot;The Third Eye&quot;. The court allowed the lawsuit to move forward in 2005, but Stewart did not attend the deposition. In a 53-page ruling, Judge Margaret Morrow dismissed the case, stating that Stewart and her attorneys &quot;had not entered any evidence to bolster its key claims or demonstrated any striking similarity between her work and the accused directors&#x27; films.&quot; In August 2014, Stewart successfully sued her lawyers because they &quot;failed to provide legal services to Ms. Stewart in the California case, and thereby breached the Contract. For example, [her lawyers] failed timely to respond to discovery requests or serve discovery requests on the California defendants, failed to depose key witnesses or develop admissible evidence, failed to deny requests for admission, and failed to respond timely to the California defendants’ motion for summary judgment.&quot; &quot;Ms. Stewart did not appear for [the 2005] deposition, ultimately twice failing to appear for her deposition; and both times unknowingly, as her attorneys never advised her of the depositions.&quot; Stewart was awarded damages totaling $316,280.62. Despite the ruling, the case became the subject of &quot;Internet legend&quot;, with many sources claiming Stewart had actually won the lawsuit.

In 2013, Thomas Althouse filed suit in California federal court alleging that ideas for the sequels &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; came from a screenplay he wrote called &quot;The Immortals&quot;. In a summary judgement for the defendants, Judge R. Gary Klausner stated &quot;The basic premises of &quot;The Matrix Trilogy&quot; and &quot;The Immortals&quot; are so different that it would be unreasonable to find their plots substantially similar.&quot;

==Influences and interpretations==


The &quot;Matrix&quot; films make numerous references to films and literature, and to historical myths and philosophy, including Buddhism, Vedanta, Advaita Hinduism, Christianity, Messianism, Judaism, Gnosticism, existentialism, obscurantism, and nihilism. The films&#x27; premise resembles Plato&#x27;s Allegory of the cave, René Descartes&#x27;s evil demon, Kant&#x27;s reflections on the Phenomenon versus the Ding an sich, Zhuangzi&#x27;s &quot;Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly&quot;, Marxist social theory and the brain in a vat thought experiment. Many references to Jean Baudrillard&#x27;s 1981 treatise &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot; appear in the first film. Baudrillard himself considered this a misrepresentation, although Lana Wachowski claims the point the reference was making was misunderstood. There are similarities to cyberpunk works such as the 1984 book &quot;Neuromancer&quot; by William Gibson, who has described &quot;The Matrix&quot; as &quot;arguably the ultimate &#x27;cyberpunk&#x27; artifact&quot;.

Japanese director Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; was a strong influence. Producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for &quot;The Matrix&quot; by showing him that anime and saying, &quot;We wanna do that for real.&quot; Mitsuhisa Ishikawa of Production I.G, which produced &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, noted that the anime&#x27;s high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, &quot;... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I&#x27;d imagine that &quot;The Matrix&quot; is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios.&quot; He stated that since &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a &quot;promotional tool&quot;. Similarities to the 1985 anime film &quot;Megazone 23&quot; have also been noticed, but the Wachowskis stated they have never seen it.

Reviewers have commented on similarities between &quot;The Matrix&quot; and other late-1990s films such as &quot;Strange Days&quot;, &quot;Dark City&quot;, and &quot;The Truman Show&quot;. The Wachowskis stated &quot;Dark City&quot; had no influence on the franchise, but commented about it and &quot;The Truman Show&quot; that they thought it was &quot;very strange that Australia came to have three films associated with it that were all about the nature of reality.&quot; Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison&#x27;s comic series &quot;The Invisibles&quot;; Morrison believes that the Wachowskis essentially plagiarized their work to create the film. The Wachowskis responded that they enjoy the comic, but did not use it for inspiration. In addition, the similarity of the films&#x27; central concept to a device in the long-running series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has also been noted. As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;) is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.

The first &quot;Matrix&quot; film features numerous references to the &quot;White Rabbit&quot;, the &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot; and mirrors, referring to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novels &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871). Matrixism is a new religious movement inspired by the trilogy. Adam Possamai, a sociologist of religion, describes these types of religions/spiritualities as hyper-real religions due to their eclectic mix of religion/spirituality with elements of popular culture and their connection to the fluid social structures of late capitalism. There is some debate about whether followers of Matrixism are indeed serious about their practice; however, the religion (real or otherwise) has received attention in the media.

Following the Wachowskis&#x27; coming out as transgender women some years after the release of the films, the first film and the pill analogy have also been analyzed in the context of the Wachowskis&#x27; transgender experiences. In this case, taking the red pill and living out of the Matrix symbolizes exploring one&#x27;s own gender identity, starting the transition and coming out as transgender, as opposed to a continued life in the closet. In 2016, Lilly Wachowski acknowledged this analysis by calling it &quot;a cool thing because it&#x27;s an excellent reminder that art is never static&quot;.

== Home media ==

In 2004, Warner Home Video released &quot;The Ultimate Matrix Collection&quot;, a 10-disc set of the films on DVD. It included the trilogy of films, &quot;The Animatrix&quot;, and six discs of additional material, including the documentary film &quot;The Matrix Revisited&quot;, the live-action footage shot for &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;, and a promotional compilation of &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;. For this release, &quot;The Matrix&quot; was remastered under the supervision of the Wachowskis and the trilogy&#x27;s cinematographer, Bill Pope, to improve its picture quality and make its color timing closer to that of its sequels. At the request of the Wachowskis, as they explain in a written statement that accompanies the boxset, each of the three films is accompanied by two audio commentaries, one by philosophers who liked the films, and another by critics who did not, with the intention that viewers use them as reference points to form their own opinion. The compilation includes 35 hours of bonus material, but some of the extras from earlier, standalone, releases are missing. A &quot;Limited Edition&quot; of &quot;The Ultimate Matrix Collection&quot; was also released. It encases the ten discs plus a resin bust of Neo inside an acrylic glass box.

&quot;The Ultimate Matrix Collection&quot; was later also released on HD DVD (5 discs) and Blu-ray (6 discs) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The HD DVD release added a picture-in-picture video commentary to the three films and the extras that were missing from the previous DVD compilation. The Blu-ray release presented &quot;The Animatrix&quot; in high definition for the first time. A pared-down set dubbed &quot;The Complete Matrix Trilogy&quot; was also released on HD DVD and Blu-ray (3 discs each), which dropped &quot;The Animatrix&quot; and some of the special features.

The Ultra HD Blu-ray release of &quot;The Matrix Trilogy&quot; came out in 2018 (9 discs), and presented the trilogy in 4K resolution and high-dynamic-range video, remastered from the original camera negative and supervised by Bill Pope. In this release, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is presented with a color grade that reportedly comes closer to its theatrical presentation than any of the previous home video releases. The set also includes standard Blu-ray copies of the films sourced from the new 4K master, but is missing &quot;The Animatrix&quot; and some special features.

==Other media and merchandising==
By August 2000, &quot;The Matrix&quot; DVD had sold over three million copies in United States, becoming the best-selling of all time. By November 2003, &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise had generated from VHS and DVD sales, from the video game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; (2003), from &quot;The Matrix Reloaded: The Album&quot; soundtrack sales, and from licensed merchandise sales. As of 2006, the franchise has grossed from all sources worldwide.

===Animation===

In acknowledgment of the strong influence of Japanese Anime on the &quot;Matrix&quot; series, &quot;The Animatrix&quot; was produced in 2003 to coincide with the release of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. This is a collection of nine animated short films intended to further flesh out the concepts, history, characters, and setting of the series. The objective of &quot;The Animatrix&quot; project was to give other writers and directors the opportunity to lend their voices and interpretation to the &quot;Matrix&quot; universe; the Wachowskis conceived of and oversaw the process, and they wrote four of the segments themselves, although they were given to other directors to execute. Many of the segments were produced by notable figures from the world of Japanese animation. Four of the films were originally released on the series&#x27; official website, one was shown in cinemas with &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, one was shown on MTV, MTV2, MTV3, MTV4, and Syfi, and the others first appeared with the DVD release of all nine shorts shortly after the release of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;.

===Video games===
On May 15, 2003, the game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; was released in North America concurrently with &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. The first of three video games related to the films, it told a story running parallel to &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and featured scenes that were shot during the filming of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;.

Two more &quot;The Matrix&quot; video games were released in 2005. The MMORPG &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; continued the story beyond &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, while &quot;The Matrix: Path of Neo&quot; allowed players to control Neo in scenes from the film trilogy. &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; was shut down in 2009.

The &quot;Matrix&quot; official website also provided several original Adobe Flash-based browser games.

An interactive technology demonstration, titled &quot;The Matrix Awakens&quot;, was released on December 9, 2021.

===Comic books===

&quot;The Matrix Comics&quot; is a set of comics and short stories based on the series and written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry; one of the comics was written by the Wachowskis and illustrated by the films&#x27; concept artist Geof Darrow. The comics and stories were originally presented for free on the &quot;Matrix&quot; series&#x27; website between 1999 and 2003. One of them was printed in 1999 to be given away at theaters as a promotional item for &quot;The Matrix&quot;, but Warner Bros. recalled it due to its mature content. Most of them were later republished by the Wachowskis&#x27; Burlyman Entertainment, along with some new stories and updates with color to some of the existing ones, in two printed trade paperback volumes in 2003 and 2004 and a deluxe hardcover twentieth-anniversary edition in 2019.

===Screensaver===
The &quot;Matrix&quot; official website provided a free screensaver for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, which simulates the falling &quot;Matrix digital rain&quot; of the films. The screensaver was reported to have a password security problem. The &quot;Matrix digital rain&quot; also inspired the creation of many unofficial screensavers.

<doc id="376233" wikidata="Q3392808" url="?curid=376233" title="Plymouth Locomotive Works">
<text>Plymouth Locomotive Works was a US builder of small railroad locomotives. All Plymouth locomotives were built in a plant in Plymouth, Ohio until 1997 when the company was purchased by Ohio Locomotive Crane and production moved to Bucyrus, Ohio in 1999. Production of locomotives has now ceased, and rights to the spare parts business have been sold to Williams Distribution.

==History==

Plymouth locomotives were first built in 1910 by the J. D. Fate Company, which became Fate-Root-Heath in 1919.
The J.D. Fate patent application filed in 1917 shows the
engine driving a clutch and a continuously variable transmission that allowed varying the speed through zero to reverse the locomotive. The output of the transmission drove a transverse jackshaft through a chain drive, with additional drive chains to the two driving axles. All early Plymouth locomotives used this drive scheme. The Fate-Root-Heath patent application filed in 1925 shows a far more conventional 4-speed transmission and reverse gears driving the jackshaft and final chain drive to the 2 driving axles.

All early Plymouth locomotives were powered by gasoline-burning internal combustion engines, but in 1927 the first diesel was produced. The company changed its name to match its locomotive plant in the late 1950s, becoming Plymouth Locomotive Works, changing again to Plymouth Industries in the late 1970s.

==Production==
Plymouth was one of the world&#x27;s most prolific builders of small industrial locomotives, with over 7,500 constructed. About 1,700 are believed to still be in active use, some over 50 years old. Almost all Plymouth locomotives were under 25 tons.

Early Plymouth gasoline-powered locomotives were built with Chrysler engines. (Chrysler&#x27;s Plymouth automotive branding was unrelated.) In 1937, Plymouth constructed two prototype short-line railroad locomotives, one that ran on butane and another that ran on propane. Plymouth produced locomotives in most rail gauges, mostly with mechanical torque converter transmissions.

<doc id="376237" wikidata="Q219610" url="?curid=376237" title="Shaman King">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiroyuki Takei. It follows the adventures of Yoh Asakura as he attempts to hone his shaman skills to become the Shaman King by winning the Shaman Fight. Takei chose shamanism as the main theme of the series because he wanted a topic that had never been attempted before in manga. The &quot;Shaman King&quot; manga was originally serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; between June 1998 and August 2004. The individual chapters were collected and released in 32 volumes. In 2017, Kodansha acquired the rights to the series and re-launched it on 35 e-book volumes in 2018, also published in print from 2020 to 2021.

A 64-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by NAS and Xebec, aired on TV Tokyo from July 2001 to September 2002. A 52-episode anime television series remake adaptation was produced by Bridge, and aired on TV Tokyo and other channels from April 2021 to April 2022. The manga has also been reprinted in a edition, and has spawned various spin-offs and sequel manga, video games, a trading card game, and many types of related merchandise.

In North America, Viz Media obtained the English-language license for &quot;Shaman King&quot; and published its chapters in &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; magazine from March 2003 to August 2007. Kodansha USA re-licensed the series in 2020, and released it in both digital and physical formats. The anime series was licensed in North America by 4Kids Entertainment in 2003 and aired on FoxBox. Video games were released by 4Kids Entertainment in North America and Europe.

In Japan, the manga has been popular. By March 2021, it had over 38 million copies in circulation. Both the manga and anime have been featured, at various times, in &quot;top ten&quot; lists of their respective media. The first &quot;Shaman King&quot; anime series was very popular during its broadcast in Japan. Publications about manga and anime have praised the series.

==Plot==
The plot of &quot;Shaman King&quot; revolves around Yoh Asakura, a shaman, a medium between the worlds of the living and the dead. Yoh seeks to become Shaman King, one able to channel the power of the Great Spirit to reshape the world as they wish, by winning the Shaman Fight, a tournament overseen by the Patch Tribe that occurs once every 500 years. Anna Kyoyama, Yoh&#x27;s fiancée, soon enters the scene and prescribes a brutal training regimen to prepare him for the tournament. Thus begins the plot that will lead Yoh on a journey that will lead him to befriend Manta Oyamada and encounter other shamans: &quot;Wooden Sword&quot; Ryu, Tao Ren, Horohoro and Faust VIII.

Yoh&#x27;s group travels to America to pass the final trial for the right to participate in the Shaman Fight, joined by Lyserg Diethel while encountering a group of shamans led by Yoh&#x27;s estranged twin brother Hao Asakura, the reincarnation of a powerful shaman who wishes to eradicate all humans and create a world for shamans. The group also encounter the X-Laws, a group dedicated with killing Hao, with Lyserg joining them. Yoh&#x27;s team is joined by Joco McDonnell (known as Chocolove McDonnell), as they engage in a series of three-man matches.
After several matches, only the teams that consist of Yoh&#x27;s group, the X-Laws, and Hao&#x27;s team remain. Due to Hao&#x27;s level of power despite being supported by the Gandhara group in selecting Yoh, Ren, Horohoro, Lyserg, and Joco as the five legendary warriors, the teams forfeit the tournament in a gambit to stop Hao while he undergoes a process to merge with the Great Spirit while Gandhara acquires the Patch Tribe&#x27;s five elemental spirits. Though Yoh and his friends defeat ten Patch tribesmen who are obligated to protect the new Shaman King, they are powerless against awaken Hao as he brings their souls and everyone they know within the Great Spirit before he commences with his goal of destroying all human life. But Yoh and his friends acquire the elemental spirits and battle Hao while joined by their friends and associates, revealing their goal is actually to ensure that Hao would not abuse his powers. It is revealed that the Great Spirit granted Hao&#x27;s wish for someone to bring back his mother&#x27;s spirit. With Anna&#x27;s help, Hao&#x27;s mother is brought to the Great Spirit. Convinced by his mother to forgive humanity for her death, Hao decides to postpone his plan to eradicate humans so he can observe how Yoh and his friends will change the world.

Seven years later, Hana Asakura waits at a station for the five legendary warriors and his parents, Yoh and Anna.

==Production==
Before creating &quot;Shaman King&quot;, Takei, an assistant of Nobuhiro Watsuki&#x27;s &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, exchanged ideas about the series with the other assistants which included the creator of &quot;One Piece&quot;, Eiichiro Oda. As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.

He chose shamanism as the principal topic of the series because he wanted to choose a subject that had never been approached in manga before. He said he incorporated his own personality and beliefs in &quot;Shaman King&quot;. He has an interest in the topic, and &quot;choosing shamanism as the subject of this story seemed like a natural extension of that.&quot; For the title, he said he used &quot;shaman&quot;, an English word, due to the fact that &quot;the nuance is really great&quot; and because he could not find a Japanese word with the accurate meaning of the word &quot;shaman&quot;. Another reason to have shamanism as the main subject was because he could explore elements from different cultures and their relationship with the dead and the spirits.

Takei created the stories after he created the characters because he believed the &quot;stories are born because of the existence of the characters&quot;. In addition, he felt that &quot;the most important thing [to create a character] is to have originality&quot;. Through his characters he wanted to show different cultures, backgrounds and values. When asked &quot;how do shamans of pacifistic religions ever win the Shaman Fight?&quot; he answered that the Shaman Fight is fought using the &quot;strength of the soul&quot;. Takei declared &quot;the final message of &quot;Shaman King&quot; is that fighting is no good.&quot;

===Manga===
====Shueisha edition====

Written and illustrated by Hiroyuki Takei, &quot;Shaman King&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from June 30, 1998, to an abrupt and improvised end on August 30, 2004. The first 275 chapters were collected into 31 volumes, released from December 3, 1998, to October 4, 2004. The release of volume 32—intended for publication on December 3, 2004—was delayed and Shueisha reported they would only publish volume 32 if they receive evidence of demand from approximately 50,000 people. The release of the last ten chapters in format happened on January 5, 2005. A spin-off to &quot;Shaman King&quot;, , published in &quot;Akamaru Jump&quot; in 2003 and 2004, lasted for five chapters—all of which were included in volume 32. Taking place seven years after the end of the manga series, it features Hana Asakura, son of Yoh and Anna, and his journey with Ryu to find the Five Elemental Warriors for a reunion before the opening of the Funbari Hot Springs Inn.

Takei declared it was not a decrease in the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a &quot;fatigue&quot; he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans&#x27; wishes. In the author&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Shaman King&quot; was being &quot;normalized&quot; by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical aspects and losing its originality. In 2007, he revealed he was planning to end the series with the finale he initially envisioned, to be published in another Shueisha magazine at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 volumes with the title &quot;Shaman King Kanzen-Ban&quot; (or &quot;Perfect Edition&quot;), concluding with the &quot;true ending&quot; to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008 with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the &quot;Shaman King Kanzen-Ban&quot; was finished, Takei said, &quot;After making the readers so much for this, the last thing I wanted to do was to disappoint them&quot;. He thought the ending was a &quot;huge responsibility&quot;. This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something &quot;fun,&quot; as it was different from scratch. &quot;Shaman King&quot; has also been published as part of the &quot;Shueisha Jump Remix&quot; series of magazine-style books. Sixteen volumes of &quot;Shaman King&quot; were released under the &quot;Shueisha Jump Remix&quot; series between April 1, 2011 and October 28, 2011.

Viz Media licensed the series for an English-language release in North America; the chapters initially serialized in the American &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;, beginning in third issue in 2003 and ceasing its serialization in the August 2007 issue. From then, it was exclusively published through graphic novel format and Viz said it was done in order to speed up the series&#x27; publication. Volume 1 was released in August or September 2003, and volume 32 was released to conclude the series on January 4, 2011. In Australasian region, Madman Entertainment licensed and published the series between February 10, 2009 and September 10, 2011.

===Critical response===
Justin Freeman from Anime News Network (ANN) criticized the first volume for relying too heavily on the spirits as a , stating that is what &quot;places the series on the wrong path.&quot; On other hand, Alexander Hoffman of Comics Village declared &quot;in this first novel, letting the relationships between Yoh, Amidamaru, and Manta flesh out is more important that developing every spiritual entity that shows up.&quot; Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime said she was fascinated by how Takei was capable of taking several myths and cultural beliefs and &quot;blending them into the character backgrounds&quot;. Lori Henderson of Manga Life cited the fact every character, even the villains, &quot;has a reason for fighting&quot; and their &quot;internal struggles&quot; as well as the fights itself as the main reason why &quot;Shaman King&quot; is &quot;an enjoyable title.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;The Star&quot; declared, praised the characters&#x27; development and Takei&#x27;s capacity to create &quot;new interesting ones each volume,&quot; commending &quot;their backgrounds and unique personalities.&quot; Writing for ANN, John Jakala commented that he was struck with the &quot;unique&quot;, &quot;graffiti-style&quot; visual of the series. Although labeled its art as &quot;silly&quot;, Sheena McNeil from Sequential Start expressed that &quot;it&#x27;s smooth and nicely detailed with &quot;excellent&quot; expressions.&quot; McNeil deemed Takei did &quot;a wonderful job of bringing shaman into the modern day but keeping it a story of fantasy&quot;. Ellingwood stated the series&#x27; &quot;vibrant action&quot;, &quot;imaginative plot twists and a creative world&quot; makes it &quot;a unique and stylish series.&quot;

Mania&#x27;s Eduardo Chavez said that, &quot;Shaman King&quot; can &quot;hit all the right buttons one volume&quot; but &quot;it could be a complete bore&quot; in the next. &quot;School Library Journal&quot;″s Cathleen Baxter commented that &quot;Shaman King&quot; has &quot;nonstop action&quot; with &quot;typical characters and battle styles&quot;. The storyline is &quot;easy to follow and will hold the reader&#x27;s interest.&quot; Margaret Veira of Active Anime, however, argued that the storyline gets more complex as the series progresses, while comics critic Jason Thompson commented that from volume 20 it &quot;seemed to veer off tracks&quot;. In addition of a decline on artwork in his opinion, the numbers of fights also decreased; Thompson wrote, &quot;their enemy ... may be unbeatable by force alone, so the plot shifts away from battles and towards unexpected betrayals, character relationships, and clever (and confusing) schemes—rather than mere fighting techniques.&quot; The last volume, especially, &quot;may leave some readers feeling cheated,&quot; said Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin. Thompson was also disappointed by the 2004 conclusion but he wrote that the version has &quot;a great ending&quot;, whose &quot;transcendental climax is not too different from Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s &quot;Akira&quot;, or for many American comics about beings with ultimate power.&quot;

<text>Soulpepper is a theater company based in Toronto, Ontario.

==History==
Soulpepper was founded in 1998 by twelve Toronto artists aiming to produce lesser-known theatrical classics. It often presents Canadian interpretations of works by noted playwrights such as Harold Pinter, Thornton Wilder, Samuel Beckett, Tom Stoppard and Anton Chekhov.

Soulpepper&#x27;s founding members are Martha Burns, Susan Coyne, Ted Dykstra, Michael Hanrahan, Stuart Hughes, Diana Leblanc, Diego Matamoros, Nancy Palk, Albert Schultz, Robyn Stevan, William Webster, and Joseph Ziegler.

In 2005, the Soulpepper Theater Company moved into its permanent building, the Young Centre for the Performing Arts. The joint project with the George Brown College theater school was designed by local firm KPMB Architects and is located in Toronto&#x27;s historic Distillery District.

In January 2018, founding artistic director Albert Schultz was publicly accused of sexual misconduct by four professional actresses who worked with him at Soulpepper. The women involved are Kristin Booth, Diana Bentley, Hannah Miller and Patricia Fagan. Lawsuits on their behalf were filed against both Schultz and Soulpepper. Schultz resigned his position as artistic director on January 4, 2018. The lawsuits were settled out of court in July 2018.

==The Academy==

Soulpepper Theatre Company aims to contribute to the growth of upcoming generations of theatre artists via the Soulpepper Academy. The Academy, which began in 2006, is a full-time, paid training program. After a nationwide search, eight artists are selected to participate in a one-year residency. During this time, they refine their abilities under the guidance of esteemed theatre practitioners, advance their careers by engaging in Soulpepper productions, offer instruction in local community classrooms, act as mentors to young individuals, and collaborate on collective creative ventures.

The Soulpepper Academy program is divided into two phases. The first is focused on training and pedagogy, while the second shifts to performance/production with ongoing training. The Academy was on hold and under review in 2018, but has since resumed.

<doc id="376240" wikidata="Q6478678" url="?curid=376240" title="Lake pigment">
<text>A lake pigment is a pigment made by precipitating a dye with an inert binder, or mordant, usually a metallic salt. Lake pigments are largely chemically organic. Manufacturers and suppliers to artists and industry frequently omit the &quot;lake&quot; designation in the name. Many lake pigments are fugitive because the dyes involved are not lightfast. Red lakes were particularly important in Renaissance and Baroque paintings; they were often used as translucent glazes to portray the colors of rich fabrics and draperies.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;lake&quot; is derived from the term &quot;lac&quot;, the secretions of the Indian wood insect &quot;Kerria lacca&quot; (formerly &quot;Laccifer lacca&quot; or &quot;Coccus lacca&quot;). It has the same root as the word &quot;lacquer&quot;, and comes originally from the Hindi word , through the Arabic word and the Persian word .

==Chemistry==
Many lake pigments are azo dyes. They characteristically have sulfonate and sometimes carboxylate substituents, which confer negative charge to the chromophore (colored species).

The metallic salts or binders used are typically colourless or almost so. The organic component of the dye determines the color of the resulting precipitate. The metallic salts that induce the formation of lakes are typically salts of dications such as Ca2+ or Sr2+. The resulting lake pigment can be diluted with an inert material such as alumina.

==History and art==
Lake pigments have a long history in decoration and the arts. Some have been produced for thousands of years and traded over long distances. In ancient times chalk, white clay, and crushed bones were used as sources of the calcium salts.

The red lakes were particularly important in the history of art; because they were translucent, they were often used in layers of glazes over a more opaque red (sometimes the mineral-based pigment vermilion, or sometimes a red lake mixed with lead white or vermilion) to create a deep, rich red color. They are common in paintings by Venetian artists of the 16th century, including Titian, to depict fine draperies and fabrics.

* Indigo lake was originally produced from the leaves of woad, and was known in ancient Egypt. In the late Middle Ages, a fashion for woad as a textile dye led to overplanting and soil exhaustion in many parts of Europe. After trade routes opened to the east, indigo was imported from India as a substitute for woad, and the cultivation of woad became uneconomical in Europe. Today, the dark blue dye known as indigo once produced from woad and &quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot; is largely of synthetic origin.
* Rose madder lake, originally from the root of the madder plant, is also known as alizarin crimson in its synthetic form. Since rose madder is fugitive when exposed to light, its use has been largely superseded, even in synthetic form, by quinacridone pigments. 
* Carmine lake, also called crimson lake, was originally produced from the cochineal insect, native to Central and South America. When Spanish colonizers encountered the Aztec Empire, they encountered Aztec warriors garbed in an unknown crimson color. Cochineal became the second most valuable export from the Spanish colonies in the Americas after silver, and the Spanish zealously guarded the secret of its production for centuries. Carminic acid, the organic compound which gives carmine its color, was synthesized in 1991. Researchers in 2022 were examining the potential to genetically engineer microbes to produce carminic acid.

Indigo and rose madder are now produced more cheaply from synthetic sources, although some use of natural products persists, especially among artisans. The food and cosmetics industries have shown renewed interest in cochineal as a source of natural red dye.

<doc id="376262" wikidata="Q282436" url="?curid=376262" title="Theobald III, Count of Champagne">
<text>Theobald III (; 13 May 1179 – 24 May 1201) was Count of Champagne from 1197 to his death. He was designated heir by his older brother Henry II when the latter went to the Holy Land on the Third Crusade, and succeeded him upon his death. He cooperated closely with his uncle and suzerain King Philip II of France. He died young, and was succeeded by a posthumous son, Theobald IV, while his widow, Blanche of Navarre, ruled as regent.

== Family==

Theobald III was the younger son of Count Henry I of Champagne and Marie of France. He succeeded as count of Champagne in 1197 upon the death of his older brother Henry II. Theobald married Blanche of Navarre on 1 July 1199 at Chartres. They had two children, a daughter, Marie, and a son, Theobald IV, born after Theobald III&#x27;s death.

==Rule==
Charters were written by Theobald and King Philip II of France in September 1198 to dictate the rights of the Jews of the one &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; the other and to repay debts by Philip to the count of Champagne for the employment of his Jews. These laws were reinforced subsequently in charters that were signed between 1198 and 1231.

In 1198, Pope Innocent III called the Fourth Crusade. There was little enthusiasm for the crusade at first, but on 28 November 1199 various nobles of France gathered at Theobald&#x27;s court for a tournament (in his castle at Ecry-sur-Aisne), including the preacher Fulk of Neuilly. There, they &quot;took the cross&quot;, and elected Theobald their leader, but he died in 1201 and was replaced by Boniface I, Marquess of Montferrat.

Following his death on 24 May 1201, Theobald&#x27;s widow Blanche ruled Champagne as regent for the following 21 years, during which the succession was contested by Theobald&#x27;s nieces Alice and Philippa, daughters of his predecessor, Henry II. Theobald was buried beside his father, Henry, at the Church of Saint Stephen at Troyes.

In 2013, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions as a founding member and artistic director of the Soulpepper Theatre Company and for his commitment to training generations of theatre artists.&quot; In May 2014, Schultz received the National Arts Centre Award, a companion award of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards, recognizing work of an extraordinary nature and significance in the performing arts in the past performance year.

==Sexual misconduct allegations==

In January 2018, Schultz was publicly accused of sexual misconduct by four professional actresses who worked with him at Soulpepper Theatre Company. The women involved are Kristin Booth, Diana Bentley, Hannah Miller and Patricia Fagan. Lawsuits on their behalf were filed against both Schultz and Soulpepper. Schultz resigned his position as artistic director on January 4, 2018, saying: &quot;While I will continue to vigorously defend myself against the allegations that are being made, I have made this decision in the interest of the future of the company into which I poured the last 20 years of my life, and in the interest of the aspirations of the artists and administrators of the company.&quot;

On August 1, 2018, representatives of Schultz, Soulpepper and the four female cast members stated that the law suits were settled. No details were released publicly.

Ann-Marie MacDonald has spoken of her time as a Soulpepper production&#x27;s equity deputy, when she complained about a fundraising event where dinners with female cast members were auctioned off.

<doc id="376273" wikidata="Q3010465" url="?curid=376273" title="Narceus americanus">
<text>Narceus americanus is a large millipede of eastern North America. Common names include American giant millipede, worm millipede, and iron worm. It inhabits the eastern seaboard of North America west to Georgetown, Texas, north of the Ottine wetlands. It has a nearly cylindrical gray body, reaching a length of . They can be commonly found in or under decaying logs from March to October. When threatened, they sometimes curl up or release a noxious liquid that contains large amounts of benzoquinones which can cause dermatological burns. This fluid may irritate eyes or skin. Many other millipedes secrete hydrogen cyanide, and while there have also been claims that &quot;N. americanus&quot; releases hydrogen cyanide, they are unsubstantiated. They do, however, excrete a substance that causes a temporary, non-harmful discoloration of the skin known as millipede burn.

== Ecology and behavior ==

=== Diet ===
&quot;N. americanus&quot; are detritivores, primarily consuming decaying wood and leaf litter. They have also been found to feed on deer scat and fresh fruit, preferring these to their typical diet when given the choice. Most feeding activity occurs at night.

=== Behavior ===
Though capable of releasing irritating and foul-smelling liquid from ozopores when aggressively disturbed, they can typically be safely handled by humans and are not uncommon on the arthropod pet market.

Their cuticle is somewhat water permeable, so they seek out damp or humid environments and have exhibited specific behaviors in response to desiccation stress. If exposed to a dry or actively desiccating environment, they will first expend energy trying to find a more favorable environment, and if this fails they reflexively curl into the typical defensive position. This position closes spiracles located at the base of legs, preventing further water loss. From a partially dehydrated state they can reabsorb moisture from high-humidity air, but moisture-rich food is necessary for complete recovery to a fully hydrated state. Molting while burrowed into the ground or into rotting wood can also be a response to chronic dehydrating conditions.

==== Burrowing ====
Burrowing is initiated by the millipede picking up sediment grains with its mandibles and using legs to pass them along its body segments, where the sediment is then deposited at the posterior end of the body. This process from start to finish can take anywhere between five and sixty minutes, depending on the size of the burrow and qualities of the soil.

Burrows can be used as temporary or more permanent dwellings, and are used to escape dry or cold surface conditions. Millipedes will typically spend non-feeding time in their burrows, which is why they are difficult to find during the day. Molting is almost exclusively done in burrows.

=== Susceptibility to predation ===
In some regions &quot;Narceus americanus&quot; seems to be subject to predation by an as yet unidentified organism that eats the head and the first few segments of the body, discarding the rest of the carcase. This seems to happen mainly, if not exclusively, on Tuckernuck Island. The observation is interpreted as reflecting the fact that some predator has discovered that only the anterior part of the animal is non-toxic. Proposed perpetrators include voles and eastern towhee.

== Reproduction ==
The average lifespan of these millipedes is unknown, but they can live up to eleven years in captivity or in the wild. Sexual maturity is not reached until 1–2 years of age.

Mating occurs at the beginning of spring through to early summer. Males mate via transfer of a spermatophore, and females are able to store this sperm to fertilize eggs at a later time. Other millipede species may lay 20–300 eggs, but &quot;N. americanus&quot; lay just one egg in a nest made of chewed leaf litter and excrement. The female millipede will wrap herself around the egg and nest until it hatches several weeks later, producing a millipede with seven body segments and only three leg pairs. The number of body segments and leg pairs are increased with each molting, and there is no parental investment after egg hatching.

<text>Tigrosa aspersa is a large (up to one-inch (25 mm) body length) wolf spider that inhabits the eastern United States. Compared to its close relative &quot;Tigrosa helluo&quot;, &quot;T. aspersa&quot; is much larger. This species was known as &quot;Hogna aspersa&quot; prior to 2012, when it was moved to &quot;Tigrosa&quot;.

A different species (&quot;Lycosa implacida&quot;) was named &quot;Lycosa aspersa&quot; in 1849 by Nicolet by accident.

Historically, major railways in the United Kingdom built the vast majority of their locomotives. Commercial locomotive builders were called upon when requirements exceeded the railway works&#x27; capacity, but these orders were generally to the railways&#x27; own designs. British commercial builders concentrated on industrial users, small railway systems, and to a large extent the export market. British-built locomotives were exported around the world, especially to the British Empire. With the almost total disappearance of British industrial railways, the shrinking of the export market and much reduced demand from Britain&#x27;s railways, few British locomotive builders survive.

<text>Jiri () is a municipality in Dolakha District in the Bagmati Province of central Nepal. At the time of the 2011 Nepal census it had a population of 13,638 people.
Jiri, which lies about 190 kilometers from Kathmandu, is the main gateway to the Everest Region. Almost all the Everest expeditions, including the one led by famous climber John Hunt, Edmund Hillary had passed through Jiri. A company of the Nepal Army is stationed in town and visitors&#x27; equipment and backpacks might be searched. There are a number of lodges available along either side of the main road mainly in Jiri Bazaar.

There are two government high schools namely Jiri Higher Secondary School at Hatanda and Dhungeshwori Secondary School at Jiri Bazaar. One private boarding school called JEM Academy, two community schools namely Martyrs Memorial School and Saraswoti Community School. There is a technical school called Jiri Technical School which provides with technical education regarding agriculture, construction and health.

Jiri was set up as agricultural development center by the Swiss Government Aid in 1938.

As the closest road head, Jiri is the trailhead for many treks into the Mount Everest region. The trek to Lukla takes seven or eight days. Few people begin a trek from Jiri, and only 5% of all trekkers who attempt the difficult trek to Everest Base Camp start at Jiri. The other 95% choose to fly into the small airstrip at Lukla, thus cutting off a week of difficult but beautiful trekking.

Although the trailhead from Jiri to Sagarmatha National Park is referred to as the &quot;classic route to Everest&quot;, the original trailhead began at Kathmandu. All early Everest expeditions—including the one led by John Hunt that put Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary on the summit—passed through Jiri. So Jiri is also called the &quot;Gateway to Mt. Everest&quot;.

It is proud to shout that Jiri is land of ethnic people called the Jirels. They love themselves called Jiriba. In Jirel language Zi means bright or, life, Ri means mountain or hill and Ba means people. Thus Jiriba means people from the bright or life mountain. The Jirel mountain climber, Lal Bahadur Jirel, who scaled Everest two times come from this place.

Besides, Jiri is one of the best tourist destinations of Nepal. Jiri is known for the natural beauty often called Switzerland (Zurich) of Nepal. It is also a place of pilgrims where there are Holy Shrines like Jireswory Rambule Losa Monastery, Yarlung Monastery etcThere are many parks.

Jiri is also famous for tall peaks lol me Pangchhyomu, Hanumante, Cherdung etc. Panch Pkhari is another destination close. to Jiri.

<text>Theobald I (, ; 30 May 1201 – 8 July 1253), also called the Troubadour and the Posthumous, was Count of Champagne (as Theobald IV) from birth and King of Navarre from 1234. He initiated the Barons&#x27; Crusade, was famous as a trouvère, and was the first Frenchman to rule Navarre.

==Rule of Champagne==

===Regency of Champagne===
Born in Troyes, he was the son of Theobald III of Champagne and Blanche of Navarre, the youngest daughter of Sancho VI of Navarre. His father died less than a week before he was born, and Blanche ruled the county as regent until Theobald turned twenty-one in 1222. He was a notable trouvère, and many of his songs have survived, including some with music.

The first half of Theobald&#x27;s life was plagued by a number of difficulties. His uncle, Count Henry II, had left behind a great deal of debt, which was far from paid off when Theobald&#x27;s father died. Further, Theobald&#x27;s right to the succession was challenged by Henry&#x27;s daughter Philippa and her husband, Erard I of Brienne, Count of Ramerupt, and one of the more powerful nobles of Champagne.

The conflict with Erard and Philippa broke into open warfare in 1215 as the Champagne War of Succession, and was not resolved until after Theobald came of age in 1222. At that time he bought out their rights for a substantial monetary payment. Some years later, in 1234, he had to spend still more to buy off Philippa&#x27;s elder sister Alice, Queen of Cyprus. The settlement of 1222 did not end Theobald&#x27;s problems, for in the following years he antagonized Louis VIII.

===Conflict with the crown===

Once he came of age Theobald personal rule was initially marked by a series of difficulties.

Theobald IV came into conflict with Louis VIII of France (1223–26) over the restrictive policies the new king tried to enforce on Jews in France. In his &quot;Etablissement sur les Juifs&quot; of November 8, 1223, Louis VIII declared that interest on Jews&#x27; debts should no longer hold good (though at the same time it also ordered that the capital should be repaid to the Jews in three years), that the debts due the Jews should be inscribed and placed under the control of their lords. The lords then collected the debts for the Jews, doubtless receiving a commission. Twenty-six barons accepted Louis VIII&#x27;s new measures, but Theobald IV did not, since he had an agreement with the Jews that guaranteed their safety in return for extra income through taxation. Theobald IV and his mother had relied on this extra income during the Succession War of his minority. Champagne&#x27;s capital at Troyes was where Rashi had lived a century before, and Champagne continued to have a prosperous Jewish population. Theobald IV&#x27;s refusal to enact Louis VIII&#x27;s new antagonistic policies towards the Jews enlarged a growing feud between the two men.

During the siege of Avignon in 1226, part of the Albigensian Crusade, due to his disagreements with the king, Theobald IV performed only the minimum service of 40 days and then went home. Louis VIII died of dysentery soon after he left, leading some to accuse Theobald IV of treachery. At the death of Louis VIII, Theobald&#x27;s political situation was difficult: he had abandoned the king in his campaigns, there were rumors that he had poisoned him, and he was barred from the coronation of Louis IX (his mother Blanche went instead). At the beginning of the regency of Blanche of Castile, he abandoned a conspiracy against the French king, which also included Hugh X of Lusignan and Peter I of Brittany, and cemented a strong relation with the regent.

Strong rumors began to spread that Theobald IV was having an affair with Louis VIII&#x27;s widow, the regent Blanche of Castile, for whom he composed a poetic homage. Queen Blanche and Theobald IV&#x27;s father Theobald III were both grandchildren of Eleanor of Aquitaine. The first chronicler to report the rumors about a love affair between Theobald and Blanche was Roger of Wendover. Wendover claims that Theobald, &quot;tormented by passion&quot; for the queen, tried to poison King Louis VIII at the siege of Avignon. Matthew Paris adds a story that the French nobles goaded the young King Louis IX to challenge Theobald to a duel to avenge his father&#x27;s death, but that Blanche put a stop to the duel. Theobald IV was becoming increasingly influential at court, and the other great counts of France were becoming resentful. It is possible that the rumors of an affair with the queen were indeed unfounded, and merely fabricated by other barons jealous of his position at court. In general, the other barons were jealous of the strengthened County of Champagne which had emerged from the Succession War, and now presented a major rival to surrounding areas.

Whatever the case, the resentful other barons invaded Champagne from 1229 to 1230. Ironically, the alliances in the invasion were reversed from the arrangement they had been in during the Succession War: Count Henry II of Bar attacked Champagne from the east, prompting Theobald IV to ally with Lorraine to attack the County of Bar. Simon of Joinville, who had fought for the rebel faction during the Succession War, now allied with Theobald IV against the external threat, and aided him in ravaging Bar, which was on the northern border of Joinville&#x27;s own lands. The conflict with the County of Bar prompted the more powerful Duchy of Burgundy to invade Champagne from the south, led by Duke Hugh IV (his father Odo III, Blanche of Navarre&#x27;s staunch ally, had died in 1218). This provoked Queen Blanche to intervene, in order to stop the spread of the conflict.

Theobald IV was able to repulse the attackers, but at great cost. Champagne&#x27;s economy was so depleted by these two major wars, as well as the crusading debts of Theobald IV&#x27;s father and uncle, that Theobald IV had to sell off his overlordship of the counties west of Paris that his ancestors held before expanding east to Champagne: Blois, Sancerre, and Chateaudun. Another major blow to morale came near the start of the invasion of 1229, when Blanche of Navarre died (of natural causes) while in retirement at Argensolles convent. Moreover, Theobald IV&#x27;s second wife Agnes of Beaujeu suddenly died in 1231, leaving Theobald IV with only their five-year-old daughter, Blanche. This left Champagne in need of a male heir, prompting Theobald IV to remarry in 1232 to Margaret of Bourbon. The situation reached its nadir in 1233, when Henry II&#x27;s elder daughter Queen Alice of Cyprus threatened to reprise the succession war of Theobald IV&#x27;s minority yet again. Theobald IV was able to pay off Alice to make her abandon her claim, but this massive expenditure left him even further in debt.

==Rule of Navarre==
Theobald succeeded his uncle Sancho VII of Navarre as King of Navarre. Theobald was in Pamplona at the time of Sancho&#x27;s death and he immediately affirmed the &quot;fueros&quot; of the realm. This greatly increased his resources (not to mention his prestige), and the remaining years of his rule were far more peaceful and prosperous. The lords and barons of Northern France who had been in conflict with Theobald IV in 1229 left him in peace, realizing that as the new king of Navarre, his position was too strong to challenge.

===Domestic and foreign policy===
As king, Theobald sealed pacts with the Crown of Castile and that of Aragon, and the Kingdom of England. He entrusted most of the government to nobles of Champagne and divided Navarre into four new districts based on fiscal functions and maintenance of public order. He began the codification of the law in the &quot;Cartulario Magno&quot; and set down on paper the Navarrese traditions known as the &quot;Fuero General&quot;, not systematically recorded until that time and kept up following Basque traditions in use on the different districts of the kingdom.

In order to gain the support of Castile, he had his daughter Blanche engaged to the future Alfonso X. By the marriage pact, Ferdinand III of León offered the lands of Guipúzcoa as long as Theobald lived, but not those of Álava to which the Navarrese monarchs had long laid claim. But with Guipúzcoa he would have attained direct access to the Cantabrian Sea. This alliance was never effected, however, as it would have meant the incorporation of Navarre as a fief of Castile. The next year, Theobald engaged his daughter to John I, Duke of Brittany, the son of his close crusading ally Peter of Dreux.

===Barons&#x27; Crusade===
It was in 1239 that Theobald directed a crusading host to the Holy Land. Militarily, the Barons&#x27; Crusade was not glorious, but it led to several diplomatic successes. He spent much time dallying at pleasant Acre (where he wrote a poem to his wife) before moving on Ascalon, where he began the construction of a castle. Whilst marching the crusader army to Ascalon, a contingent of 400 knights led by Hugh of Burgundy, Henry of Bar, and Amaury de Montfort chose to engage Muslim forces at Gaza. The contingent was defeated before Theobald&#x27;s forces arrived to rescue them.

Theobald negotiated with the Ayyubids of Damascus and Egypt, who were at odds with each other at the time, finalizing a treaty with the former (in the north) against the latter (in the south) whereby the Kingdom of Jerusalem regained Jerusalem itself, plus Bethlehem, Nazareth, and most of the region of Galilee with many Templar castles, such as Belfort and Saphet. He also negotiated a truce with the Egyptians. Some contemporary sources even imply that the whole of the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean was put back in crusader hands.

It is debatable how much of the ultimate success of the crusade (the most successful since the First in territorial terms) was attributable to Theobald&#x27;s intentions and how much was just fortuitous. He returned from Palestine late in 1240, before Richard of Cornwall arrived, because he did not wish to be present during any more debating over the leadership and direction of the enterprise. Souvenirs that he brought back to Europe included the rose called &quot;Provins&quot; (Latin name rosa gallica &#x27;officinalis&#x27;, the Apothecary&#x27;s Rose) from Damascus, transporting it &quot;in his helmet&quot;; a piece of the true cross; and perhaps the Chardonnay grape which in modern times is an important component of champagne.

===Conflict with Church and final years===

Theobald spent most of the remainder of his reign travelling back and forth between Navarre and Champagne. He was at odds with the bishop of Pamplona, Pedro Jiménez de Gazólaz, who held a provincial synod in 1250 to excommunicate him. He refused to respond to papal tribunals, but Pope Innocent IV conceded him the privilege of kings: nobody could excommunicate him save the Holy See. Theobald died at Pamplona, on a return from one of his many visits to Champagne. He was buried in the Cathedral of Pamplona. He was succeeded first by his elder son Theobald II and then by his younger son Henry I.

==Marriages and issue==
Theobald married three times. He married Gertrude of Dagsburg in 1220, and divorced her two years later when he came of age. They had no children.

Secondly, in 1222, he married Agnes of Beaujeu. The marriage produced at least one child:
*Blanche of Navarre, Duchess of Brittany

Agnes died in 1231. Theobald married thirdly to Margaret of Bourbon. Theobald and Margaret had six children:
*Eleanor (born 1233, died young)
*Peter (died young)
*Margaret, in 1255 married to Frederick III, Duke of Lorraine
*Theobald II of Navarre, married Isabella, daughter of Louis IX of France
*Beatrix, married Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy
*Henry I of Navarre, married Blanche of Artois

Theobald had at least two daughters out of wedlock.

With an unknown mistress, he had Agnes, who married Álvar Pérez de Azagra, 4th Lord of Albarracín.

With Marquesa López de Rada, daughter of Lope Díaz de Rada and Brunisende of Narbonne, he had Marquesa Gil de Rada, who married Pedro Fernández, baron of Hijar, illegitimate son of king Jaime I of Aragon.

<text>China Clipper (NC14716) was the first of three Martin M-130 four-engine flying boats built for Pan American Airways and was used to inaugurate the first commercial transpacific airmail service from San Francisco to Manila on November 22, 1935. Built at a cost of $417,000 by the Glenn L. Martin Company in Baltimore, Maryland, it was delivered to Pan Am on October 9, 1935. It was one of the largest airplanes of its time.

On November 22, 1935, it took off from Alameda, California on commission to deliver the first airmail cargo across the Pacific Ocean. Although its inaugural flight plan called for the &quot;China Clipper&quot; to fly over the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge (still under construction at the time), upon take-off the pilot realized the plane would not clear the structure, and was forced to fly narrowly under instead. On November 29, the airplane reached its destination, Manila, after traveling via Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, and Sumay, Guam, and delivered over 110,000 pieces of mail. The crew for this flight included Edwin C. Musick as pilot and Fred Noonan as navigator.
The inauguration of ocean airmail service and commercial air flight across the Pacific was a significant event for both California and the world. Its departure point is California Historical Landmark #968 and can be found in Naval Air Station Alameda.

==Aircraft==

Although each clipper that joined the Pan American fleet to serve on their Trans-Pacific routes was given an individual name, collectively they were known as the &quot;China Clippers&quot;.

Although a Sikorsky S-42 flying boat was used on the initial proving flights, it had insufficient range to carry passengers along the route. Consequently, the passenger service was started with Martin M-130 flying boats:

*&quot;China Clipper&quot; (NC-14716) October 1935 
*&quot;Philippine Clipper&quot; (NC-14715) November 1935
*&quot;Hawaii Clipper&quot; (NC-14714) March 1936

Later the larger Boeing 314 Clipper flying boats were assigned to the route:

*&quot;Honolulu Clipper&quot; (NC-18601) January 1939
*&quot;California Clipper&quot; (NC-18602) January 1939
*&quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; (NC-18609(A)) May 1941

Additional clippers were assigned to the Trans-Atlantic and South American routes operated by Pan-American.

That China Clipper&#x27;s wingspan was 130 feet and it weighed 52,000 pounds. It was powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp 14-cylinder radial engines and could achieve a maximum speed of 180mph. The aircraft had a maximum range of 3,200 miles, with a cruising ceiling of 17,000 feet and could carry 18 passengers on overnight trips, or 46 passengers on single day trips.

The clippers were, for all practical purposes, luxury flying hotels, with sleeping accommodation, dining rooms and leisure facilities in addition to the usual aircraft seating. On early flights, the crew outnumbered the passengers. As a result, the price of a return air ticket from San Francisco to Honolulu was $1700 (). In comparison, a brand-new Plymouth automobile cost about $600 in the late 1930s.

==Airmail service==
Considerable effort was put into preparing for the inauguration of the first Trans-Pacific airmail flight. In San Francisco the celebrations for the inaugural trans-Pacific airmail flight included fireworks, while a band played a Sousa march. Eleven days prior, Musick had flown the &quot;China Clipper&quot; from the Glenn L. Martin factory in Middle River, Maryland to California for the inaugural event. Ships docked in the bay to observe the historic event, sounding their whistles and sirens in tribute. It was estimated that up to a hundred thousand people watched from the various shores of San Francisco Bay. Several speeches were made by various public figures after which there was a ceremonial loading of the numerous mail bags. Musick&#x27;s sailing orders were publicly delivered by his boss, Juan Trippe, while the entire event was broadcast by CBS and NBC radio and also transmitted on seven foreign networks.

The relatively short range of the aircraft meant that hotel, catering, docking, repair, road and radio facilities had to be put in place at the intermediate stops along the route, particularly on the virtually uninhabited islands of Wake and Midway. Nearly a half a million miles were flown along the route before any paying passengers were carried.
The &quot;China Clipper&quot; was the first commercial aircraft to establish a regular airmail route from the United States across the Pacific Ocean. On its inaugural airmail flight the &quot;China Clipper&quot; took off from Alameda, California, on November 22, 1935, making its way to Manila via Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam over the course of one week. All stops were chosen on the basis that were links in an “all-American” flag route, i.e. countries friendly with the United States.
There were no passengers, only crew-members aboard the first airmail flight. The payload consisted of 111,000 envelopes weighing approximately 2,000 pounds, making it the largest mail shipment ever taken on board an airplane. Prior to the clipper’s departure, the post office, which anticipated only a third of the final total volume, continued to bring in more plane loads of mail from across the country. In San Francisco some 100 postal clerks were kept busy preparing the tens of thousands of letters in preparation for their delivery aboard the Clipper. The payload of mail was nearly all philatelic, consisting of envelopes prepared by collectors who wanted an example of mail flown on the “first flight”. To accommodate the unexpected volume of mail the furnishings onboard intended for passengers were removed to make room for the mail many dozens of mail pouches.
The &quot;China Clipper&quot; arrived in Manila on November 29, 1935, eight thousand miles away from San Francisco, making prior stops at Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island and Guam. Not counting the hold-over time spent in the several ports along the route, the actual flying time of the aircraft was 59 hours and 48 minutes. The same voyage by the fastest steamship of the time would have taken more than two weeks.

Following the inaugural flight over the Pacific Ocean, the China Clipper&#x27;s sister ships, the &quot;Philippine Clipper&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Clipper&quot;, also of the same model, carried mail and cargo back and forth across the Pacific. By October 1936, points along the route were finally ready to accommodate passenger service.
In January 22, 2024, Emmanuel Calairo, Chairperson of the National Historical Commission in the presence of MaryKay Carlson, the US Ambassador to the Philippines and Commodore Marco Tronqued, unveiled a historical marker at the Manila Yacht Club, honoring the arrival of China Clipper to the Philippines in 1935 (in the presence of MaryKay Carlson, the US Ambassador to the Philippines and Commodore Marco Tronqued).

==World War II==
The &quot;China Clipper&quot; was painted olive drab with a large American flag painted below the cockpit. The &quot;China Clipper&quot; was referred to as &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;. The &quot;Sixteen&quot; is a reference to the aircraft&#x27;s registration number NC14716.

==Crash==

The &quot;China Clipper&quot; remained in Pan Am service until January 8, 1945, when it was destroyed in a crash in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Flight 161 had started at Miami bound for Leopoldville in the Belgian Congo, making its first stop to refuel at Puerto Rico before flying on to Port-of-Spain. After one missed approach, on the second approach to land it came down too low and hit the water at a high speed and nose-down a mile-and-a-quarter short of its intended landing area. The impact broke the hull in two which quickly flooded and sank. Twenty-three passengers and crew were killed; there were seven survivors including Captain C.A. Goyette, Pilot-in-Command for the flight, and Captain L.W. Cramer, First Officer, who was flying the plane from the left seat when it crashed.

On April 24, 1946, the Civil Aeronautics Board released its accident investigation report with the following findings &quot;upon the basis of all available evidence&quot;:
# The carrier, aircraft and pilots had proper certificates.
# Captain Cramer, having very limited flight time in the aircraft, was at the controls with Captain Goyette acting in a supervisory capacity.
# Conditions of weather and water surface within the vicinity of Port-of-Spain were satisfactory for a safe approach and landing.
# The plane first contacted the water at a higher-than-normal landing speed, and in a nose-low attitude.
# The crash occurred at a point one-and-a-quarter miles short of the intended landing area.
# Forces created by the speeds of the plane on its contact with the water and the excessive nose-down-attitude caused failure of the hull bottom and its structure resulting in rapid submersion of the aircraft.
# Landing of the aircraft in the attitude indicated, under the then-existing conditions of water surface and weather, was due to Cramer&#x27;s having misjudged his true altitude and his failure to correct his attitude for a normal landing. 
# At the time of the accident, Captain Cramer was not wearing eyeglasses as required by his pilot certificate.
# Captain Goyette, in command of the aircraft and with full knowledge of Cramer&#x27;s limited experience in the Martin M-130, failed to exercise sufficient supervision of the landing.

*Probable cause: On the basis of the above findings, the board determined that the probable cause of this accident was: (1) First Officer Cramer&#x27;s failure to realize his proximity to the water and to correct his attitude for a normal landing and, (2) the lack of adequate supervision by the captain during the landing resulting in the inadvertent flight into the water in excess of normal landing speed and in a nose-down attitude.

==Legacy==

Both the United States and Philippine Islands issued stamps for air mail carried on the first flights in each direction of PAA&#x27;s Transpacific &quot;China Clipper&quot; service between San Francisco and Manila (November 22 – December 6, 1935)
First National Pictures released the movie &quot;China Clipper&quot; in 1936. It told a thinly disguised bio of the life of Juan Trippe during the founding of PanAm. The film made use of much documentary footage of the actual airplane, as well as aerial photography created specifically for the production. It was also one of Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s early roles.

Footage of the China Clipper, and/or possibly other M-130s loading and taking off from Alameda, is included in the 1937 comedy film &quot;Fly-Away Baby&quot; and the 1939 adventure film &quot;Secret Service of the Air.&quot;

The &quot;China Clipper&quot; is also a significant setting in the contemporaneous radio serial &quot;Speed Gibson of the International Secret Police&quot; (1937–1939).
More recently, it was referenced in the Monkees song &quot;Zilch&quot; from their 1967 album &quot;Headquarters&quot;. Davy Jones can be heard repeating &quot;China Clipper calling Alameda&quot; in that track.

The flying boats and Treasure Island, San Francisco were featured by Huell Howser in &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; Episode 906.

=== China Clipper II ===

In 1985, Pan Am resurrected the &quot;China Clipper&quot; aircraft name onto its new Boeing 747-212B registered N723PA, which was named &quot;China Clipper II&quot; to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the China Clipper Flight. On November 22, 1985, the China Clipper II began its flight across the Pacific to retrace the original route of the first China Clipper Flight. The flight departed from San Francisco on November 22, 1985, and made several stop flight following the original China Clipper flight route, such as Honolulu, Wake Island, Guam and all the way to Manila with its final destination to Bali, which was a new route that was not included in the original itinerary. Pan Am also made several advertisements and television commercials to promote the new China Clipper II plane which shows the original China Clipper Martin M-130 plane and also the new China Clipper II Boeing 747-212B aircraft and was aired in several countries as part of Pan Am promotion to commemorate China Clipper 50th Anniversary Flight.

<text>A glissade is a climbing technique mostly used in mountaineering and alpine climbing where a climber starts a controlled slide down a snow and/or ice slope to speed up their descent. Glissading is ideally done later in the day when the snow is softer.

Most glissading is done in a seated position (and ideally with a water-proof durable surface on which to sit and slide), with the legs bent to absorb shocks and bumps, and an ice axe held diagonally across the body to be in a position to perform a self-arrest if the glissade starts to get out of control. Crampons are explicitly not used while glissading as they can cause serious injury. Some climbers can glissade in a standing-up position (also called &#x27;boot-skiing&#x27;), which has a greater risk and is unfeasible for longer slides.

As glissading is typically done on the descent of a climb when climbers are tired, it can lead to serious injuries. Glissading with crampons is particularly dangerous and can lead to broken ankles, but tired climbers sometimes forget to take them off. High-speed glissading is also not advised and can make any self-arrest more difficult and also dangerous (e.g. such as dislocated shoulders); it can also result in uncontrolled falls onto more dangerous terrain, and has been known to set off avalanches under certain conditions. Glissading near crevasses (e.g. a glacier or a bergshrund) is also very dangerous, and even more so when attempted as a rope team.

This species breeds in colonies in marshes and islands from southern Russia to Mongolia. It is migratory, wintering in the eastern Mediterranean, Arabia and India. This gull nests on the ground, laying between two and four eggs.

It occurs in western Europe only as a vagrant. In Great Britain a recent review left a single occurrence in 1859 as the only acceptable record of this bird. The species also occurs as a vagrant in differing parts of the Indian Ocean, south of its normal range, and along the northern and eastern coasts of Africa, where it visits annually on an irregular basis.

==Description==
This is a very large gull, being easily the world&#x27;s largest black-headed gull and the third largest species of gull in the world, after the great black-backed gull and the glaucous gull. It measures in length with a wingspan. Weight can vary from , with an average of in males and in females. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . Summer adults are unmistakable, since no other gull of this size has a black hood. The adults have grey wings and back, with conspicuous white &quot;mirrors&quot; at the wing tips. The legs are yellow and the bill is orangey-yellow with a red tip.

In all other plumages, a dark mask through the eye indicates the vestiges of the hood. The call is a deep &quot;aargh&quot; cry. Young birds attain largely grey upperparts quite rapidly, but they take four years to reach maturity.

==Ecology==
This bird has a deep, rather nasal flight-call which resembles the call of the lesser black-backed gull. Although they are noisy at colonies, Pallas&#x27;s gulls are mostly silent when breeding.

These birds are predatory, taking fish, crustaceans, insects and even small mammals.

The Pallas&#x27;s gull is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.
