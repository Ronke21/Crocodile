<text>Black Beauty: His Grooms and Companions, the Autobiography of a Horse is an 1877 novel by English author Anna Sewell. It was written from a horse as main character&#x27;s perspective. She wrote it in the last years of her life, during which she was bedridden and seriously ill. The novel became an immediate best-seller, with Sewell dying just five months after its publication, but having lived long enough to see her only novel become a success. With fifty million copies sold, &quot;Black Beauty&quot; is one of the best-selling books of all time.

While forthrightly teaching animal welfare, it also teaches how to treat people with kindness, sympathy, and respect. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 58 on the BBC&#x27;s survey &quot;The Big Read&quot;. It is seen as a forerunner of the pony book.

==Background==
Anna Sewell was born in Great Yarmouth, England, and had a brother named Philip, who was an engineer in Europe. At the age of 14, Anna fell while walking home from school in the rain and injured both ankles. Through the mistreatment of the injury, she became unable to walk or stand for any length of time for the rest of her life. Disabled and unable to walk, she began learning about horses, spending many hours driving her father to and from the station from which he commuted to work. Her dependence on horse-drawn transportation fostered her respect for horses. Sewell&#x27;s introduction to writing began in her youth when she helped edit the works of her mother, Mary Wright Sewell (1797–1884), a deeply religious, popular author of juvenile best-sellers.

Anna Sewell never married or had children. In visits to European spas, she met many writers, artists, and philanthropists. Her only book was &quot;Black Beauty&quot;, written between 1871 and 1877 in her house at Old Catton. During this time, her health was declining, and she could barely get out of bed. Her dearly loved mother often had to help her with her illness. She sold the book to the local publishers, Jarrold &amp; Sons. The book broke records for sales and is the &quot;sixth best seller in the English language.&quot; By telling the story of a horse&#x27;s life in the form of an autobiography and describing the world through the eyes of the horse, Anna Sewell broke new literary ground.

Sewell died of hepatitis or tuberculosis on 25 April 1878, only five months after the novel was published, but she lived long enough to see its initial success. She was buried on 30 April 1878 in the Quaker burial-ground at Lammas near Buxton, Norfolk, where a wall plaque marks her resting place. Her birthplace in Church Plain, Great Yarmouth, is now a museum.

Although &quot;Black Beauty&quot; is looked at as a children&#x27;s novel, Sewell did not write the novel for children. She said that her purpose in writing the novel was &quot;to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses&quot;—an influence she attributed to an essay on animals she read earlier by Horace Bushnell (1802–1876) entitled &quot;Essay on Animals&quot;. Her sympathetic portrayal of the plight of working animals led to a vast outpouring of concern for animal welfare and is said to have been instrumental in the abolition of the cruel practice of using the checkrein (or &quot;bearing rein&quot;, a strap used to keep horses&#x27; heads high, fashionable in Victorian England but painful and damaging to a horse&#x27;s neck). &quot;Black Beauty&quot; also mentions the use of blinkers on horses, concluding that this use is likely to cause accidents at night due to interference with &quot;the full use of&quot; a horse&#x27;s ability to &quot;see much better in the dark than men can.&quot;

==Plot summary==
The story is narrated in the first person as an autobiographical memoir told by the titular horse named Black Beauty—beginning with his carefree days as a foal on an English farm with his mother, to his difficult life pulling cabs in London, to his happy retirement in the country. Along the way, he meets with many hardships and recounts many tales of cruelty and kindness. Each short chapter recounts an incident in Black Beauty&#x27;s life containing a lesson or moral typically related to the kindness, sympathy, and understanding treatment of horses, with Sewell&#x27;s detailed observations and extensive descriptions of horse behaviour lending the novel a good deal of verisimilitude.

The book describes conditions among London horse-drawn cab drivers, including the financial hardship caused to them by high licence fees and low, legally fixed fares. A page footnote in some editions says that soon after the book was published, the difference between 6-day cab licences (not allowed to trade on Sundays) and 7-day cab licences (allowed to trade on Sundays) was abolished and the cab licence fee was much reduced.

==Genre==
&quot;Black Beauty&quot; is considered to be one of the first fictional animal autobiographies. Originally meant to be informative literature read by adults on the norms of horse cruelty and preventions of these unjust acts, &quot;Black Beauty&quot; is now seen as a children&#x27;s book. Narrated by the main character, Black Beauty, the novel is read by thousands of children worldwide.

==Analysis==
Sewell uses anthropomorphism in &quot;Black Beauty&quot;. The text advocates the fairer treatment of horses in Victorian England. The story is narrated from Black Beauty&#x27;s perspective and resultantly readers arguably gained insight into how horses suffered through their use by human beings with restrictive technical objects like the &quot;bearing rein&quot; and &quot;blinkers&quot; as well as procedures like cutting off the tails of the horses. For instance, Ginger describes the physical effects of the &quot;bearing rein&quot; to Black Beauty, by stating, &quot;it is dreadful... your neck aching until you don&#x27;t know how to bear it... its hurt my tongue and my jaw and the blood from my tongue covered the froth that kept flying from my lips&quot;. Tess Coslett highlights that Black Beauty&#x27;s story is structured in a way that makes him similar to those he serves. The horses in the text have reactions as well as emotions and characteristics, like love and loyalty, which are similar to those of human beings. Coslett emphasizes that, while &quot;Black Beauty&quot; is not the first book written in the style of an animal autobiography, it is a novel that &quot;allows the reader to slide in and out of horse-consciousness, blurring the human/animal divide&quot;. Dwyer suggests that  &quot;by the end of the nineteenth century the concern for animal welfare was often mediated by considerations of utility&quot;, implying that these animals (horses) were seen to get the job done by any means rather than the approach that they could be demonizing the animal.

==Publications==
Published in 1877, in the last years of Anna Sewell&#x27;s life, &quot;Black Beauty&quot; sold over 50 million copies worldwide in 50 different languages. This different viewpoint sparked people&#x27;s interest to speak for horses&#x27; well-being and implement legislation. According to Sewell, providing information was her original goal of horse injustice. Although the shift of perspectives was seen as good for some, it was also an issue to others including horse owners and people who sold such equipment for horses (equipment like blinders). It has been alleged that &quot;Black Beauty&quot; was banned in some countries, e.g. South Africa, for containing the words &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Beauty&quot; during its apartheid restrictions on African natives. However, Claire Datnow, in her memoir &quot;Behind the Walled Garden of Apartheid: Growing up White in Segregated South Africa&quot;, writes that this &quot;fact&quot; was a standing joke among her circle of friends, invented to make fun of the &quot;ignorance of the censors&quot;—the idea being that &quot;Black Beauty&quot; had been banned &quot;because the censors thought it referred to a black woman.&quot;

==Reception==
Upon publication of the book, many readers related to the pain of the victimized horses, sympathized and ultimately wanted to see the introduction of reforms that would improve the well-being of horses. Two years after the release of the novel, one million copies of &quot;Black Beauty&quot; were in circulation in the United States. In addition, animal rights activists would habitually distribute copies of the novel to horse drivers and to people in stables. The depiction of the &quot;bearing rein&quot; in &quot;Black Beauty&quot; spurred so much outrage and empathy from readers that its use was not only abolished in Victorian England, but public interest in anti-cruelty legislation in the United States also grew significantly. The arguably detrimental social practices concerning the use of horses in &quot;Black Beauty&quot; inspired the development of legislation in various states that would condemn such abusive behaviours towards animals. The impact of the novel is still very much recognized today. Writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare&quot;, Bernard Unti calls &quot;Black Beauty&quot; &quot;the most influential anti-cruelty novel of all time&quot;. Comparisons have also been made between &quot;Black Beauty&quot; and the most important social protest novel in the United States, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, on account of the strong degree of outrage and protest action that both novels triggered in society.

==Characters==
===Horses===
* Darkie (Black Beauty)/Black Auster/Jack/Blackie/Old Crony: The narrator of the story, a handsome black horse. He begins his career as a carriage horse for wealthy people but when he &quot;breaks his knees&quot; (i.e. develops scars on the fronts of his wrist (carpal) joints after a bad fall) he is no longer considered presentable enough and is put to much harder work. He passes through the hands of a series of owners, some cruel, some kind. He always tries his best to serve humans despite the circumstances.
* Duchess (nicknamed &quot;Pet&quot;): Beauty&#x27;s and Rob Roy&#x27;s mother, who encourages Beauty to be good from a young age.
* Rob Roy: A fellow black horse from Beauty&#x27;s original farm, who is killed in a hunting incident (along with his rider, Squire Gordon&#x27;s only son). It is later learned that he was Beauty&#x27;s half-brother, an older son of Duchess.
* Lizzie: A high-strung, nervous mare whom Lady Anne rides one day and is spooked until Black Beauty comes to her aid with his rider.
* Ginger: A companion of Beauty&#x27;s at Birtwick Park, she is named for her chestnut colour and her habit of biting, which is often how the spice, ginger, is described. Ginger is a more aggressive horse due to her traumatic upbringing. After being ridden by Lord George in a steeplechase her back is strained. Beauty and Ginger meet for the last time as broken-down cab horses in London, and later a cart carrying a dead horse (whom Beauty believes is Ginger), passes by Beauty.
* Merrylegs: A short, dappled grey, handsome pony who is polite to humans and horses alike. He is ridden by the young daughters at Birtwick Park, then sent to live with a vicar who promises never to sell him.
* Sir Oliver: An older horse whose tail was docked, to his great annoyance and discomfort.
* Rory: A job horse usually paired with Black Beauty. Became a coal carting horse after getting hit in the chest by a cart driven on the wrong side of the road.
* Peggy: A hired horse who cannot run very fast due to her short legs. She runs at an odd hopping pace between a trot and a canter when expected to keep pace with other horses at a fast trot. When paired with a faster horse to pull a carriage she often gets whipped for not keeping up. Sold to two ladies who wanted a safe horse.
* Unnamed young horse: paired with Beauty after Peggy leaves. Often frightened by things he cannot see as he does not know whether they are dangerous or not.
* Captain: A former army horse who witnessed horrific incidents in the Crimean War, although he was well treated and received no serious wounds. He lost his beloved master in the Charge of the Light Brigade. He became a cab-horse for Jerry, where he works with Black Beauty. After a penetrating shoulder injury from a carriage pole due to a collision with a carriage whose driver was drunk, Jerry has him shot rather than send him to work as a cart-horse.
* Hotspur: A five-year-old horse bought to replace Captain. Jerry sells him to Grant when he leaves London.
* Justice: A calm peaceful horse that Beauty meets at Birtwick Park.

===Beauty&#x27;s owners===
====Part 1====
* Farmer Grey: Beauty&#x27;s first owner, a good kind man who trains him well.
* Mr. Douglas Gordon (Squire Gordon): A very kind and loving master who was also the squire. Lives in Birtwick Park. Has to sell Beauty and Ginger when he leaves the country because of his wife&#x27;s illness.
* Mr. John Manly: Black Beauty&#x27;s groom at Squire Gordon&#x27;s.
* Mr. James Howard: John Manly&#x27;s assistant at Squire Gordon&#x27;s. He leaves to work as a coachman for Sir Clifford Williams.
* Mr. Joseph Green (Joe): A kind boy who replaces James at Squire Gordon&#x27;s hall. Beauty becomes seriously ill after little Joe gives Beauty a pail of cold water to drink and then assumes Beauty does not need a blanket, all after a long, exhausting gallop.
* Bill: A boy who keeps thrashing and whipping a pony to attempt to make him jump a fence.
* Mrs. Bushby: Bill&#x27;s mother who is worried when she hears that he fell into a bush.

====Part 2====
* Earl of W: Purchases Beauty and Ginger from Squire Gordon. Lives in Earlshall Park.
* Lady W: Wife of Lord W. Demands that Beauty and Ginger wear bearing reins to hold their heads up high. When York tries to comply with Lady W&#x27;s order Ginger lashes out, kicking everything around her.
* Mr. York: Earl of W&#x27;s coachman. He treats the horses kindly but is scared to speak for the horses.
* Reuben Smith: A first-rate driver who can treat a horse as well as a farrier, due to spending two years with a veterinary surgeon, and being an ostler at an inn. Unfortunately he occasionally drinks heavily. Though York tries to hide this problem, the Earl finds out and fires Reuben. York later convinces the Earl to rehire him. After taking Colonel Blantyre to town Reuben gets drunk in the White Lion, then rides Beauty back to Earlshall Park. Due to a loose nail in Beauty&#x27;s shoe, which Reuben was too drunk to care about, Beauty&#x27;s shoe comes off. Reuben then makes Beauty gallop over sharp stones injuring Beauty&#x27;s hoof and causing him to stumble. Beauty falls and scrapes his knees, while Reuben is flung off Beauty and dies from a cervical spine fracture.
* Master of the livery stables: Buys Beauty and hires him out to people in Bath who wish to rent a horse. Some of the people who rent Beauty are good drivers, most are not.
* Mr. Barry: Buys Beauty from the livery stables after his friend rents Beauty several times, as his doctor advised him to get more horse exercise. He tries to treat horses well but hires two bad grooms (a thief and a humbug) due to his lack of knowledge on horse care. Decides to sell Beauty at a horse fair.

====Part 3====
* Mr. Jeremiah (Jerry) Barker: A kind owner and religious man who uses Beauty and Captain as cab horses. After Captain is injured he buys Hotspur to replace him. Refuses to work on Sunday or force his horses to go beyond a &#x27;jog-trot&#x27; through London for customers with poor timekeeping, although he will break these rules for a good cause. One New Year&#x27;s Eve, Jerry is kept waiting in blizzard conditions by inconsiderate young men who stayed too long playing cards, contracts bronchitis, and nearly dies. Jerry&#x27;s doctor tells him he must not return to cab work. Jerry takes a job with Mrs. Fowler as her coachman.
* Mrs. Polly Barker: Wife of Jerry. Always waits up for her husband.
* Mr. Harry Barker: Son of Jerry. Helps his father look after the horses.
* Miss Dorothy (Dolly) Barker: Daughter of Jerry. Often brings food to her father.
* Mr. (Grey / Governor) Grant: a respected and long-serving cab driver. When Jerry is ill he takes out Hotspur and gives Jerry half the money he makes.

====Part 4====
* Corn dealer/baker  Steven: Uses Beauty as a workhorse. Works him fairly but due to the poor lighting in Beauty&#x27;s stable Beauty nearly goes blind.
* Foreman: Has Beauty overloaded so that fewer journeys are required to deliver goods.
* Mr. Jakes: A carter who works for the baker. Dislikes overloading Beauty but cannot go against the foreman. Makes Beauty work with the bearing rein up until a lady shows him that Beauty would find it easier to pull the cart without the bearing rein.
* Mr. Nicholas Skinner: A ruthless cab-horse owner who charges a high fee for renting cab horses. As a result, the only way the drivers who rent his horse can make money is by overworking the horse, usually by whipping the horse to make it move even when tired. When Beauty collapses from overwork, Skinner plans to send Beauty to a knacker but a farrier convinces him to rest Beauty and sell him at a horse fair. Seedy Sam used to rent horses from him.
* Willie: Grandson of Farmer Thoroughgood who wants to help Black Beauty when he comes to the market with his grandfather.
* Farmer Thoroughgood: A kind owner who cares for Black Beauty when he is at his weakest.
* The three ladies: Beauty&#x27;s final home, where he spends the rest of his days very well treated. The ladies are Miss Blomefield, Miss Ellen, and Miss Lavinia and are most likely sisters.
* Joseph (Joe) Green: Coachman for the three ladies. Recognizes Beauty as the horse that used to belong to Squire Gordon.

==Influence upon other works==

* &quot;Beautiful Joe&quot; was a best-selling 1893 novel about a dog that was directly influenced by &quot;Black Beauty&quot; and followed a similar path to fame through awareness of cruelty to animals.
* &quot;The Strike at Shane&#x27;s: A Prize Story of Indiana&quot; is an anonymous American novel that won a monetary award and national publication in 1893 in a contest sponsored by the American Humane Society, and was reprinted several times commercially thereafter. Described in the introduction as a &quot;Sequel to &quot;Black Beauty&quot;&quot;&#x27;, it tells the story of good and bad treatment of farm animals and local wildlife, especially songbirds, in the America Midwest. The novel is generally attributed as the first published work of the novelist Gene Stratton Porter, and bears a remarkable textual similarity to her other books.
* One of the most popular of the interwar pony stories for children, &quot;Moorland Mousie&quot; (1929), by &#x27;Golden Gorse&#x27; (Muriel Wace), is heavily influenced by &quot;Black Beauty&quot;.
* Phyllis Briggs wrote a sequel called &quot;Son of Black Beauty&quot;, published in 1950.
* The Pullein-Thompson sisters wrote several stories concerning relatives of Black Beauty. They are &quot;Black Ebony&quot; (1975; by Josephine), &quot;Black Velvet&quot; (1975; by Christine), &quot;Black Princess&quot; (1975; by Diana), &quot;Black Nightshade&quot; (1978; by Josephine), &quot;Black Romany&quot; (1978; by Diana), &quot;Blossom&quot; (1978; by Christine), &quot;Black Piper&quot; (1982; by Diana), &quot;Black Raven&quot; (1982; by Josephine) and &quot;Black Pioneer&quot; (1982; by Christine). The book &quot;Black Swift&quot; (1991) by Josephine is not about a Black Beauty relative. These were published in several compilations as well as some of them being available separately. Each compilation was subsequently republished, sometimes with a change of name.
* Spike Milligan wrote a parody of the novel called &quot;Black Beauty According to Spike Milligan&quot; (1996).

<text>The Berezina or Byarezina (, ; ) is a river in Belarus and a right tributary of the Dnieper. The river starts in the Berezinsky Biosphere Reserve. The length of the Berezina is . The width of the river is 15–20 m, the maximum is 60 m. The banks are low (up to 0.5 m), steep in some areas (up to 1.5 m high), sandy, and the floodplain is swampy. The Berezina usually freezes over in the first half of December.

Its main tributaries are Bobr, Klyava, Ol&#x27;sa and from the left and Hayna and Svislach from the right. The Berezinsky Biosphere Reserve by the river is on the UNESCO list of biosphere reserves. Peat bogs cover 430 km2 and thus occupy a large part of the reserve. These open peat zones have remained virtually untouched and are among Europe&#x27;s largest bogs.

==Settlements==
Cities and towns on the Berezina from north to south include:
* Dokshytsy 
* Svislach
* Barysaw
* Babruysk
* Svyetlahorsk

==Historical significance==
*Charles XII of Sweden&#x27;s army crossed the Berezina on 25 June 1708, during his campaign against Peter the Great of Russia in the Great Northern War. (see for details)
*Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s army suffered heavy losses (about 50,000) when they were crossing the Berezina in November 1812, during the retreat from Russia (see Battle of Berezina). Since then &quot;Berezina&quot; is used in French as a synonym for catastrophe. See Charles Joseph Minard § The map of Napoleon&#x27;s Russian campaign for a visual graphic of the army&#x27;s fate
*Several armies in German Wehrmacht Army Group Centre were entrapped and prevented from crossing the Berezina in June 1944, during the envelopment phases of the Bobruysk and Minsk Offensives, within the closing phases of Operation Bagration in World War II. 
*There were military actions between Germany and Russia at the Berezina River in 1917–1918.
*Several battles are named after the river.

<text>Jackson&#x27;s Valley campaign, also known as the Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1862, was Confederate Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#x27;s spring 1862 campaign through the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia during the American Civil War. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson&#x27;s 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040 km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond.

Jackson suffered an initial tactical defeat (his second defeat of the war) at the First Battle of Kernstown (March 23, 1862) against Col. Nathan Kimball (part of Union Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks&#x27;s army), but it proved to be a strategic Confederate victory because President Abraham Lincoln reinforced the Union&#x27;s Valley forces with troops that had originally been designated for the Peninsula campaign against Richmond. Following Kernstown, Jackson retreated to form a line at Stony Creek south of Woodstock, making his headquarters at Narrow Passage on Stony Creek. It was there he summoned a local cartographer, Jedediah Hotchkiss, who recommended he withdraw from the indefensible Stony Creek to Rude&#x27;s Hill, a strategic small promontory but a commanding defensive position astride the Valley Turnpike south of Mt. Jackson. It was at Rude&#x27;s Hill, which was Jackson&#x27;s headquarters from April 2–17, that Jackson reorganized his command. Jackson had instructed Hotchkiss to &quot;make me a map of the Valley, from Harper&#x27;s Ferry to Lexington, showing all the points of offence and defence [sic] in those places.&quot; The Shenandoah Valley had never been comprehensively mapped before, and Hotchkiss&#x27; maps and knowledge of the terrain proved to be a decisive tactical advantage for Jackson throughout the rest of the campaign.

On May 8, after more than a month of skirmishing with Banks, Jackson moved deceptively to the west of the Valley and drove back elements of Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont&#x27;s army in the Battle of McDowell, preventing a potential combination of the two Union armies against him. Jackson then headed down the Valley once again to confront Banks. Concealing his movement in the Luray Valley, Jackson joined forces with Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell and captured the Federal garrison at Front Royal on May 23, causing Banks to retreat to the north. On May 25, in the First Battle of Winchester, Jackson defeated Banks and pursued him until the Union Army crossed the Potomac River into Maryland.

Bringing in Union reinforcements from eastern Virginia, Brig. Gen. James Shields recaptured Front Royal and planned to link up with Frémont in Strasburg. Jackson was now threatened by three small Union armies. Withdrawing up the Valley from Winchester, Jackson was pursued by Frémont and Shields. On June 8, Ewell defeated Frémont in the Battle of Cross Keys and on the following day, crossed the North River to join forces with Jackson to defeat Shields in the Battle of Port Republic, bringing the campaign to a close.

Jackson followed up his successful campaign by forced marches to join Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond. His audacious campaign elevated him to the position of the most famous general in the Confederacy (until this reputation was later supplanted by Lee) and has been studied ever since by military organizations around the world.

==Background==

In the spring of 1862 &quot;Southern morale... was at its nadir&quot; and &quot;prospects for the Confederacy&#x27;s survival seemed bleak.&quot; Following the successful summer of 1861, particularly the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas), its prospects declined quickly. Union armies in the Western Theater, under Ulysses S. Grant and others, captured Southern territory and won significant battles at Fort Donelson and Shiloh. And in the East, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s massive Army of the Potomac was approaching Richmond from the southeast in the Peninsula campaign, Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell&#x27;s large corps was poised to hit Richmond from the north, and Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks&#x27;s army was threatening the Shenandoah Valley. However, Jackson&#x27;s Confederate troops were in &quot;excellent spirits,&quot; laying the foundation for his performance in the Valley that spring, which helped derail the Union plans and re-energize Confederate morale elsewhere.

During the Civil War, the Shenandoah Valley was one of the most strategic geographic features of Virginia. The watershed of the Shenandoah River passed between the Blue Ridge Mountains on the east and the Allegheny Mountains to the west, extending 140 miles southwest from the Potomac River at Shepherdstown and Harpers Ferry, at an average width of 25 miles. By the conventions of local residents, the &quot;upper Valley&quot; referred to the southwestern end, which had a generally higher elevation than the lower Valley to the northeast. Moving &quot;up the Valley&quot; meant traveling southwest, for instance. Between the North and South Forks of the Shenandoah River, Massanutten Mountain soared 2,900 feet and separated the Valley into two halves for about 50 miles, from Strasburg to Harrisonburg. During the 19th century, there was but a single road that crossed over the mountain, from New Market to Luray. The Valley offered two strategic advantages to the Confederates. First, a Northern army entering Virginia could be subjected to Confederate flanking attacks pouring through the many wind gaps across the Blue Ridge. Second, the Valley offered a protected avenue that allowed Confederate armies to head north into Pennsylvania unimpeded; this was the route taken by Gen. Robert E. Lee to invade the North in the Gettysburg campaign of 1863 and by Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early in the Valley campaigns of 1864. In contrast, the orientation of the Valley offered little advantage to a Northern army headed toward Richmond. But denying the Valley to the Confederacy would be a significant blow. It was an agriculturally rich area—the 2.5 million bushels of wheat produced in 1860, for example, accounted for about 19% of the crop in the entire state and the Valley was also rich in livestock—that was used to provision Virginia&#x27;s armies and the Confederate capital of Richmond. If the Federals could reach Staunton in the upper Valley, they would threaten the vital Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, which ran from Richmond to the Mississippi River. Stonewall Jackson wrote to a staff member, &quot;If this Valley is lost, Virginia is lost.&quot; In addition to Jackson&#x27;s campaign in 1862, the Valley was subjected to conflict for virtually the entire war, most notably in the Valley campaigns of 1864.

==Opposing forces==
===Confederate===


Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s command, the Valley District of the Department of Northern Virginia, expanded significantly during the campaign as reinforcements were added, starting with a force of a mere 5,000 effectives and reaching an eventual peak of 17,000 men. It remained, however, greatly outnumbered by the various Union armies opposing it, which together numbered 52,000 men in June 1862.

In March 1862, at the time of the Battle of Kernstown, Jackson commanded the brigades of Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett, Col. Jesse S. Burks, Col. Samuel V. Fulkerson, and cavalry under Col. Turner Ashby. In early May, at the Battle of McDowell, Jackson commanded two units that were putatively armies, although they were smaller than normal divisions: his own &quot;Army of the Valley&quot;, consisting of the brigades of Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder, Col. John A. Campbell, and Brig. Gen. William B. Taliaferro; the Army of the Northwest, commanded by Brig. Gen. Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson, consisted of the brigades of Cols. Zephaniah T. Conner and W.C. Scott.

In late May and June, for the battles starting at Front Royal, Jackson commanded two infantry divisions and a cavalry command. &quot;Jackson&#x27;s Division&quot; consisted of the brigades of Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder, Col. John A. Campbell (wounded and replaced by Col. John M. Patton Jr.), and Col. Samuel V. Fulkerson (replaced by Brig. Gen. William B. Taliaferro). The Second Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, consisted of the brigades commanded by Col. W.C. Scott (replaced by Brig. Gen. George H. Steuart), Brig. Gen. Arnold Elzey (replaced by Col. James A. Walker), Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble, Brig. Gen. Richard Taylor, and Brig. Gen. George H. Steuart (an all-Maryland brigade known as the &quot;Maryland Line&quot;). The cavalry was commanded during the period by Col. Thomas S. Flournoy, Brig. Gen. George H. Steuart, Brig. Gen. Turner Ashby, and Col. Thomas T. Munford.

===Union===


Union forces varied considerably during the campaign as armies arrived and withdrew from the Valley. The forces were generally from three independent commands, an arrangement which reduced the effectiveness of the Union response to Jackson.

Initially, the Valley was the responsibility of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks. In March 1862, at the time of the Battle of Kernstown, he commanded the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac; and on April 4, he assumed command of the Department of the Shenandoah. His force initially consisted of two divisions under Brig. Gens. James Shields and Alpheus S. Williams, with an independent brigade under Brig. Gen. John W. Geary. At Kernstown, Shields&#x27; division was led by Col. Nathan Kimball with brigades under Kimball, Col. Jeremiah C. Sullivan, Col. Erastus B. Tyler, and cavalry under Col. Thornton F. Brodhead. At the end of April, Shields&#x27; division would be transferred from Banks to McDowell&#x27;s command, leaving Banks with just one division, under Williams, consisting of the brigades of Cols. Dudley Donnelly and George H. Gordon, and a cavalry brigade under Brig. Gen. John P. Hatch.

Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont commanded the Mountain Department, west of the Valley. In early May, part of Frémont&#x27;s command consisting of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck&#x27;s brigade and Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy&#x27;s brigade faced Jackson at the Battle of McDowell. At the end of May, Fremont entered the Valley with a division under Brig. Gen. Louis Blenker, consisting of brigades of Brig. Gen. Julius H. Stahel, Col. John A. Koltes, and Brig. Gen. Henry Bohlen, as well as brigades under Col. Gustave P. Cluseret, Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy, Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck, and Brig. Gen. George D. Bayard.

Also at the end of May, McDowell was ordered to send troops to the Valley. Thus Shields returned to the Valley with his division consisting of the brigades of Brig. Gen. Nathan Kimball, Brig. Gen. Orris S. Ferry, Brig. Gen. Erastus B. Tyler, and Col. Samuel S. Carroll.

==Initial movements==

On November 4, 1861, Jackson accepted command of the Valley District, with his headquarters at Winchester. Jackson, recently a professor at Virginia Military Institute and suddenly a hero at First Manassas, was familiar with the valley terrain, having lived there for many years. His command included the Stonewall Brigade and a variety of militia units. In December, Jackson was reinforced by Brig. Gen. William W. Loring and 6,000 troops, but his combined force was insufficient for offensive operations. While Banks remained north of the Potomac River, Jackson&#x27;s cavalry commander, Col. Turner Ashby, raided the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. In the Romney Expedition of early January 1862, Jackson fought inconclusively with two small Union posts at Hancock, Maryland, and Bath.

In late February, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan ordered Banks, reinforced by Brig. Gen. John Sedgwick, across the Potomac to protect the canal and railroad from Ashby. Banks moved south against Winchester in conjunction with Shields&#x27;s division approaching from the direction of Romney. Jackson&#x27;s command was operating as the left wing of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s army, and when Johnston withdrew from Manassas to Culpeper in March, Jackson&#x27;s position at Winchester was isolated. He began withdrawing &quot;up&quot; the Valley (to the higher elevations at the southwest end of the Valley) to cover the flank of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s army, withdrawing from the Centreville–Manassas area to protect Richmond. Without this protective movement, the Federal army under Banks might strike at Johnston through passes in the Blue Ridge Mountains. By March 12, 1862, Banks occupied Winchester just after Jackson had withdrawn from the town, marching at a leisurely pace 42 miles up the Valley Pike to Mount Jackson. On March 21, Jackson received word that Banks was splitting his force, with two divisions (under Brig. Gens. John Sedgwick and Alpheus S. Williams) returning to the immediate vicinity of Washington, D.C., freeing up other Union troops to participate in Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula campaign against Richmond. The remaining division, under Brig. Gen. James Shields, was stationed at Strasburg to guard the lower (northeastern) Valley, and intelligence indicated that it was withdrawing toward Winchester. Banks made preparations to leave the Valley personally on March 23.

==Valley campaign==

===Kernstown (March 23, 1862)===
Jackson&#x27;s orders from Johnston were to prevent Banks&#x27;s force from leaving the Valley, which it appeared they were now doing. Jackson turned his men around and, in one of the more grueling forced marches of the war, moved northeast 25 miles on March 22 and another 15 to Kernstown on the morning of March 23. Ashby&#x27;s cavalry skirmished with the Federals on March 22, during which engagement Shields was wounded with a broken arm from an artillery shell fragment. Despite his injury, Shields sent part of his division south of Winchester and one brigade marching to the north, seemingly abandoning the area, but in fact halting nearby to remain in reserve. He then turned over tactical command of his division to Col. Nathan Kimball, although throughout the battle to come, he sent numerous messages and orders to Kimball. Confederate loyalists in Winchester mistakenly informed Turner Ashby that Shields had left only four regiments and a few guns (about 3,000 men) and that these remaining troops had orders to march for Harpers Ferry in the morning. Jackson marched aggressively north with his 3,000-man division, reduced from its peak as stragglers fell out of the column, unaware that he was soon to be attacking almost 9,000 men.

Jackson moved north from Woodstock and arrived before the Union position at Kernstown around 11 a.m., Sunday, March 23. He sent Turner Ashby on a feint against Kimball&#x27;s position on the Valley Turnpike while his main force—the brigades of Col. Samuel Fulkerson and Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett (the Stonewall Brigade)—attacked the Union artillery position on Pritchard Hill. The lead brigade under Fulkerson was repulsed, so Jackson decided to move around the Union right flank, about 2 miles west on Sandy Ridge, which appeared to be unoccupied. Kimball countered the maneuver by moving his brigade under Col. Erastus B. Tyler to the west, but Fulkerson&#x27;s men reached a stone wall facing a clearing on the ridge before the Union men could.

Around 4 p.m, Tyler attacked Fulkerson and Garnett on a narrow front. The Confederates were temporarily able to counter this attack with their inferior numbers by firing fierce volleys from behind the stone wall. Jackson, finally realizing the strength of the force opposing him, rushed reinforcements to his left, but by the time they arrived around 6 p.m., Garnett&#x27;s Stonewall Brigade had run out of ammunition and he pulled them back, leaving Fulkerson&#x27;s right flank exposed. Jackson tried in vain to rally his troops to hold, but the entire Confederate force was forced into a general retreat. Kimball organized no effective pursuit.

Union casualties were 590 (118 killed, 450 wounded, 22 captured or missing), Confederate 718 (80 killed, 375 wounded, 263 captured or missing). Despite the Union victory, President Lincoln was disturbed by Jackson&#x27;s audacity and his potential threat to Washington. He sent Banks back to the Valley along with Alpheus Williams&#x27;s division. He also was concerned that Jackson might move into western Virginia against Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont, so he ordered that the division of Brig. Gen. Louis Blenker be detached from McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac and sent to reinforce Frémont. Lincoln also took this opportunity to re-examine Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s plans for the defenses of Washington while the Peninsula campaign was underway and decided that the forces were insufficient. He eventually ordered that the corps of Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell, which was moving south against Richmond in support of McClellan, remain in the vicinity of the capital. McClellan claimed that the loss of these forces prevented him from taking Richmond during his campaign. The strategic realignment of Union forces caused by Jackson&#x27;s battle at Kernstown—the only battle he lost in his military career—turned out to be a strategic victory for the Confederacy.

After the battle, Jackson arrested Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett for retreating from the battlefield before permission was received. He was replaced by Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder. Garnett suffered from the humiliation of his court-martial for over a year, until he was finally killed in Pickett&#x27;s Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg.

===Retreating from the Valley (March 24 – May 7)===
At first light the day after Kernstown, Union forces pursued Jackson and drove Ashby&#x27;s cavalry in a panic. However, Banks called off the pursuit while supply problems were addressed. For the next three days the Union forces advanced slowly while Jackson retreated to Mount Jackson. It was there that he directed Capt. Jedediah Hotchkiss, &quot;I want you to make me a map of the Valley, from Harpers Ferry to Lexington, showing all the points of offense and defense.&quot; Given Hotchkiss&#x27;s mapmaking skills, Jackson would have a significant advantage over his Federal opponents in the campaign to come. On April 1, Banks lunged forward, advancing to Woodstock along Stony Creek, where he once again was delayed by supply problems. Jackson took up a new position at Rude&#x27;s Hill near Mount Jackson and New Market.

Banks advanced again on April 16, surprising Ashby&#x27;s cavalry by fording Stony Creek at a place they had neglected to picket, capturing 60 of the horsemen, while the remainder of Ashby&#x27;s command fought their way back to Jackson&#x27;s position on Rude&#x27;s Hill. Jackson assumed that Banks had been reinforced, so he abandoned his position and marched quickly up the Valley to Harrisonburg on April 18. On April 19, his men marched 20 miles east out of the Shenandoah valley to Swift Run Gap. Banks occupied New Market and crossed Massanutten Mountain to seize the bridges across the South Fork in the Luray Valley, once again besting Ashby&#x27;s cavalry, who failed to destroy the bridges in time. Banks now controlled the valley as far south as Harrisonburg.

Though Banks was aware of Jackson&#x27;s location, he misinterpreted Jackson&#x27;s intent, thinking that Jackson was heading east of the Blue Ridge to aid Richmond. Without clear direction from Washington as to his next objective, Banks proposed his force also be sent east of the Blue Ridge, telling his superiors that &quot;such [an] order would electrify our force.&quot; Instead, Lincoln decided to detach Shield&#x27;s division and transfer it to Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell at Fredericksburg, leaving Banks in the Valley with only a single division. Banks was then instructed to retreat down the valley and assume a defensive position at Strasburg.

By this time, McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula campaign was well underway and Joseph E. Johnston had relocated most of his army for the direct protection of Richmond, leaving Jackson&#x27;s force isolated. Johnston sent new orders to Jackson, instructing him to prevent Banks from seizing Staunton and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, reinforcing him with the 8,500-man division under Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, left behind at Brandy Station. Jackson, at a strong defensive position on Rude&#x27;s Hill, corresponded with Ewell to develop a strategy for the campaign.

During this period, Jackson also faced difficulty within his own command. He arrested Garnett and had a nasty confrontation with Turner Ashby in which Jackson displayed his displeasure at Ashby&#x27;s performance by stripping him of 10 of his 21 cavalry companies and reassigning them to Charles S. Winder, Garnett&#x27;s replacement in command of the Stonewall Brigade. Winder mediated between the two officers and the stubborn Jackson uncharacteristically backed down, restoring Ashby&#x27;s command. More importantly, Jackson received an April 21 letter from Gen. Robert E. Lee, military adviser to President Jefferson Davis, requesting that he and Ewell attack Banks to reduce the threat against Richmond that was being posed by McDowell at Fredericksburg.

Jackson&#x27;s plan was to have Ewell&#x27;s division move into position at Swift Run Gap to threaten Banks&#x27;s flank, while Jackson&#x27;s force marched toward the Allegheny Mountains to assist the detached 2,800 men under Brig. Gen. Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson, who were resisting the advance toward Staunton of Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy, the leading element of Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont&#x27;s army. If Frémont and Banks were allowed to combine, Jackson&#x27;s forces could be overwhelmed, so Jackson planned to defeat them in detail. Without waiting for Lee&#x27;s reply, Jackson executed his plan and on April 30, Ewell&#x27;s division replaced Jackson&#x27;s men at Swift Run Gap. Jackson marched south to the town of Port Republic in heavy rains and on May 2, turned his men east in the direction of Charlottesville and began marching over the Blue Ridge. To the surprise of his men and officers, whom Jackson habitually left in the dark as to his intentions, on May 4 they boarded trains that were heading west, not east toward Richmond, as they had anticipated. The movement to the east had been a clever deception. On May 5, Jackson&#x27;s army camped around Staunton, about 6 miles from Johnson&#x27;s command. On May 7, Milroy, whose troops were based at McDowell, with pickets east of the mountain (elements of the 32nd Ohio) as an advance picket, and more troops posted around North Mountain, received intelligence that Jackson and Johnson were combining against him and, and skirmishing intensified across the valley between Union and Confederate pickets. Despite wishing for battle, he began to fall back across the Alleghenies due to knowledge of the enemy&#x27;s numerical superiority, and he dispatched requests to Franklin for reinforcements, which general Schenck obliged and prepared his troops to move southwards to reinforce Milroy at 11:00 AM on May 7. Milroy attempted to stifle the rebel advance over Shenandoah Mountain by posting two artillery pieces along the road, which slowed down Jackson&#x27;s column. As more Confederate columns continued to cross the mountains, Milroy decided to retreat northwards for McDowell and await arrival of reinforcements. On the morning of May 8, Milroy&#x27;s command was surprised to see the Confederate troops moving to occupy strong positions atop Bull Pasture Mountain. Milroy immediately decided that a swift attack must be done while the rebel forces had still not consolidated their position, so he ordered his artillery to bombard the rebel positions atop Bull Pasture Mountain. Soon afterwards, at 10:00 AM, Schenck&#x27;s column arrived and reinforced Milroy.

===McDowell (May 8)===

As Milroy withdrew north of McDowell On May 8, Jackson arrived at McDowell, a village in Highland County, to find that Allegheny Johnson was deploying his infantry. The Union force of about 6,000 under Milroy and Schenck was camped in the village to the west side of the Bullpasture River. Overlooking the scene was a spur of Bullpasture Mountain known as Sitlington Hill, a mile-long plateau that could potentially dominate the Union position. However, there were two disadvantages: the single trail that reached the summit was so difficult that artillery could not be deployed there, and the rugged terrain—densely forested, steep slopes and ravines—offered opportunities for Union attackers to climb the 500 feet to the summit without being subjected to constant Confederate fire.

The Union generals realized that they were outnumbered by the 10,000 men that Jackson and Johnson commanded and that their men would be particularly vulnerable to artillery fire from Sitlington Hill. They did not realize that Jackson could not bring up his artillery. Therefore, in order to buy time for their troops to withdraw at night, Milroy recommended a preemptive assault on the hill and Schenck, his superior officer, approved. At about 4:30 p.m., 2,300 Federal troops crossed the river and assaulted Sitlington Hill. Their initial assault almost broke Johnson&#x27;s right, but Jackson sent up Taliaferro&#x27;s infantry and repulsed the Federals. The next attack was at the vulnerable center of the Confederate line, where the 12th Georgia Infantry occupied a salient that was subjected to fire from both sides. The Georgians, the only non-Virginians on the Confederate side, proudly and defiantly refused to withdraw to a more defensible position and took heavy casualties as they stood and fired, silhouetted against the bright sky as easy targets at the crest of the hill. One Georgia private exclaimed, &quot;We did not come all this way to Virginia to run before Yankees.&quot; By the end of the day the 540 Georgians suffered 180 casualties, losses three times greater than any other regiment on the field. Johnson was wounded and Taliaferro assumed command of the battle while Jackson brought up additional reinforcements. The fighting continued until about 10 p.m., when the Union troops withdrew.

Milroy and Schenck marched their men north from McDowell beginning at 12:30 a.m. on May 9. Jackson attempted to pursue, but by the time his men started the Federals were already 13 miles away. On a high ridge overlooking the road to Franklin, Schenck took up a defensive position and Jackson did not attempt to attack him. Union casualties were 259 (34 killed, 220 wounded, 5 missing), Confederate 420 (116 killed, 300 wounded, 4 missing), one of the rare cases in the Civil War where the attacker lost fewer men than the defender.

===Conflicting orders (May 10–22)===
While Jackson was at McDowell, Ewell was fidgeting at Swift Run Gap, trying to sort out numerous orders he was receiving from Jackson and Johnston. On May 13 Jackson ordered Ewell to pursue Banks if he withdrew down the Valley from Strasburg, whereas Johnston had ordered Ewell to leave the Valley and return to the army protecting Richmond if Banks moved eastward to join McDowell at Fredericksburg. Since Shields&#x27;s division was reported to have left the Valley, Ewell was in a quandary about which orders to follow. He met in person with Jackson on May 18 at Mount Solon and the two generals decided that while in the Valley, Ewell reported operationally to Jackson, and that a prime opportunity existed to attack Banks&#x27;s army, now depleted to fewer than 10,000 men, with their combined forces. When subsequent peremptory orders came to Ewell from Johnston to abandon this idea and march to Richmond, Jackson was forced to telegraph for help from Robert E. Lee, who convinced President Davis that a potential victory in the Valley had more immediate importance than countering Shields. Johnston modified his orders to Ewell: &quot;The object you have to accomplish is the prevention of the junction of General Banks&#x27;s troops and those of General McDowell&#x27;s.&quot;

On May 21, Jackson marched his command east from New Market over Massanutten Mountain, combining with Ewell on May 22, and proceeded down the Luray Valley. Their speed of forced marching was typical of the campaign and earned his infantrymen the nickname of &quot;Jackson&#x27;s foot cavalry&quot;. He sent Ashby&#x27;s cavalry directly north to make Banks think that he was going to attack Strasburg, where Banks began to be concerned that his 4,476 infantry, 1,600 cavalry, and 16 artillery pieces might be insufficient to withstand Jackson&#x27;s 16,000 men. However, Jackson&#x27;s plan was first to defeat the small Federal outpost at Front Royal (about 1,000 men of the 1st Maryland Infantry under Col. John R. Kenly), a turning movement that would make the Strasburg position untenable.

===Front Royal (May 23)===


Early on May 23, Turner Ashby and a detachment of cavalry forded the South Fork of the Shenandoah River and rode northwest to capture a Union depot and railroad trestle at Buckton Station. Two companies of Union infantry defended the structures briefly, but the Confederates prevailed and burned the building, tore up railroad track, and cut the telegraph wires, isolating Front Royal from Banks at Strasburg. Meanwhile, Jackson led his infantry on a detour over a path named Gooney Manor Road to skirt the reach of Federal guns on his approach to Front Royal. From a ridge south of town, Jackson observed that the Federals were camped near the confluence of the South and North Forks and that they would have to cross two bridges in order to escape from his pending attack.

The center of Jackson&#x27;s line of battle were the ferocious Louisiana Tigers battalion (150 men, part of Brig. Gen. Richard Taylor&#x27;s brigade in Ewell&#x27;s division), commanded by Col. Roberdeau Wheat, and the 1st Maryland Infantry, the latter bitter enemies of Kenly&#x27;s Union 1st Maryland Infantry. The first shots were fired around 2 p.m. and the Confederates quickly pushed the small Federal detachment out of town. Kenly and his men made a stand on a hill just north of town and Jackson prepared to charge them with the Marylanders in the center and the Louisianians against their left flank. Before the attack could commence, Kenly saw Confederate cavalry approaching the bridges that he needed for his escape route and he immediately ordered his men to abandon their position. They first crossed the South Fork bridges and then the wooden Pike Bridge over the North Fork, which they set afire behind them. Taylor&#x27;s Brigade raced in pursuit and Jackson ordered them to cross the burning bridge. As he saw the Federals escaping, Jackson was frustrated that he had no artillery to fire at them. His guns were delayed on the Gooney Manor Road detour route the infantry had taken and Ashby&#x27;s cavalry had failed to deliver Jackson&#x27;s orders for them to take the direct route after the battle started.

A detachment of 250 Confederate cavalry under Col. Thomas S. Flournoy of the 6th Virginia Cavalry arrived at that moment and Jackson set them off in pursuit of Kenly. The retreating Union troops were forced to halt and make a stand at Cedarville. Although the cavalrymen were outnumbered three to one, they charged the Union line, which broke but reformed. A second charge routed the Union detachment. The results of the battle were lopsided. Union casualties were 773, of which 691 were captured. Confederate losses were 36 killed and wounded. Jackson&#x27;s men captured about $300,000 of Federal supplies; Banks soon became known as &quot;Commissary Banks&quot; to the Confederates because of the many provisions they won from him during the campaign. Banks initially resisted the advice of his staff to withdraw, assuming the events at Front Royal were merely a diversion. As he came to realize that his position had been turned, at about 3 a.m. he ordered his sick and wounded to be sent from Strasburg to Winchester and his infantry began to march midmorning on May 24.

The most significant after effect of Banks&#x27;s minor loss at Front Royal was a decision by Abraham Lincoln to redirect 20,000 men from the corps of Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell to the Valley from their intended mission to reinforce George B. McClellan on the Peninsula. At 4 p.m. on May 24, he telegraphed to McClellan, &quot;In consequence of General Banks&#x27;s critical position I have been compelled to suspend General McDowell&#x27;s movements to you. The enemy are making a desperate push upon Harper&#x27;s Ferry, and we are trying to throw Frémont&#x27;s force and part of McDowell&#x27;s in their rear.&quot;

===Winchester (May 25)===
On May 24, Jackson planned to intercept Banks&#x27;s retreating army, but it was not clear what route Banks would take. He could either march straight for Winchester or, if the Confederates abandoned Front Royal and raced to Winchester ahead of him, he could slip behind them and escape to the east over the Blue Ridge. Jackson decided to watch the road from Cedarville to Middletown. If Banks moved directly to Winchester, Jackson could hit him in his flank by using that road, but he deemed it unwise to commit his entire force from the Front Royal area until he could rule out the Blue Ridge escape possibility. He sent scouts from Turner Ashby&#x27;s cavalry on the Strasburg–Front Royal Road and two regiments of cavalry from Ewell&#x27;s division, commanded by Brig. Gen. George H. Steuart, to Newtown, hoping to intercept the vanguard of Banks&#x27;s column. At the same time, he ordered Ewell to take the bulk of his division on the road to Winchester, but not to get too far away in case he had to be recalled. The remainder of Jackson&#x27;s army moved north to Cedarville.

Receiving word from Steuart that the Federals had indeed begun a retreat down the Valley Pike, Jackson began directing forces to Middletown. Although they had to contend with Union cavalry (five companies of the 1st Maine and two companies of the 1st Vermont) and were thus delayed en route, they reached a rise outside of Middletown at about 3 p.m. and began artillery bombardments of the Union column. The chaos that this produced was exacerbated by a charge by the Louisiana Tigers, who began looting and pillaging in the wagon train. When Union artillery and infantry arrived to challenge Jackson at around 4 p.m, Richard Taylor&#x27;s infantry turned to meet the threat while Jackson sent his artillery and cavalry north to harass the Union column ahead. By the time Taylor&#x27;s attack started the Union troops had withdrawn and Jackson realized that it was merely the rearguard of Banks&#x27;s column. He sent word to Ewell to move quickly to Winchester and deploy for an attack south of the town. Jackson&#x27;s men began a pursuit down the Valley Pike, but they were dismayed to see that Ashby&#x27;s cavalrymen had paused to loot the wagon train and many of them had become drunk from Federal whiskey. The pursuit continued long after dark and after 1 a.m., Jackson reluctantly agreed to allow his exhausted men to rest for two hours.

Jackson&#x27;s troops were awakened at 4 a.m. on May 25 to fight the second Sunday battle of the campaign. Jackson was pleased to find during a personal reconnaissance that Banks had not properly secured a key ridge south of the town. He ordered Charles Winder&#x27;s Stonewall Brigade to occupy the hill, which they did with little opposition, but they were soon subjected to punishing artillery and small arms fire from a second ridge to the southwest—Bower&#x27;s Hill, the extreme right flank of the Federal line—and their attack stalled. Jackson ordered Taylor&#x27;s Brigade to deploy to the west and the Louisianians conducted a strong charge against Bower&#x27;s Hill, moving up the steep slope and over a stone wall. At the same time, Ewell&#x27;s men were outflanking the extreme left of the Union line. The Union lines broke and the soldiers retreated through the streets of town. Jackson later wrote that Banks&#x27;s troops &quot;preserved their organization remarkably well&quot; through the town. They did so under unusual pressure, as numerous civilians—primarily women—fired at the men and hurled objects from doorways and windows. Jackson was overcome with enthusiasm and rode cheering after the retreating enemy. When a staff officer protested that he was in an exposed position, Jackson shouted &quot;Go back and tell the whole army to press forward to the Potomac!&quot;

The Confederate pursuit was ineffective because Ashby had ordered his cavalry away from the mainstream to chase a Federal detachment. Jackson lamented, &quot;Never was there such a chance for cavalry. Oh that my cavalry was in place!&quot; The Federals fled relatively unimpeded for 35 miles in 14 hours, crossing the Potomac River into Williamsport, Maryland. Union casualties were 2,019 (62 killed, 243 wounded, and 1,714 missing or captured), Confederate losses were 400 (68 killed, 329 wounded, and 3 missing).

===Union armies pursue Jackson===

Word of Banks&#x27;s ejection from the Valley caused consternation in Washington because of the possibility that the audacious Jackson might continue marching north and threaten the capital. President Lincoln, who in the absence of a general in chief was exerting day to day strategic control over his armies in the field, took aggressive action in response. Not yielding to panic and drawing troops in for the immediate defense of the capital, he planned an elaborate offensive. He ordered Frémont to march from Franklin to Harrisonburg to engage Jackson and Ewell, to &quot;operate against the enemy in such a way as to relieve Banks.&quot; He also sent orders to McDowell at Fredericksburg:

Lincoln&#x27;s plan was to spring a trap on Jackson using three armies. Frémont&#x27;s movement to Harrisonburg would place him on Jackson&#x27;s supply line. Banks would recross the Potomac and pursue Jackson if he moved up the Valley. The detachment from McDowell&#x27;s corps would move to Front Royal and be positioned to attack and pursue Jackson&#x27;s column as it passed by, and then to crush Jackson&#x27;s army against Frémont&#x27;s position at Harrisonburg. Unfortunately for Lincoln, his plan was complex and required synchronized movements by separate commands. McDowell was unenthusiastic about his role, wishing to retain his original mission of marching against Richmond to support McClellan, but he sent the division of Brig. Gen. James Shields, recently arrived from Banks&#x27;s army, marching back to the Valley, to be followed by a second division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Edward O. C. Ord. But Frémont was the real problem for Lincoln&#x27;s plan. Rather than marching east to Harrisonburg as ordered, he took note of the exceptionally difficult road conditions on Lincoln&#x27;s route and marched north to Moorefield. (He also was cognizant of the enormous area his department was required to defend and he was concerned about dividing his force and abandoning his subordinate, Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox, who had been attacked in southwestern Virginia on May 23.) But as a result, instead of a figurative hammer (Shields) striking at Jackson on an anvil (Frémont), all Lincoln could hope for would be a pincer movement catching Jackson at Strasburg, which would require intricate timing to succeed.

Jackson received word of Shields&#x27;s return march on May 26, but he had been urged by Robert E. Lee to threaten the line of the Potomac. So while the bulk of his army camped near Charles Town, he ordered the Stonewall Brigade to demonstrate against Harpers Ferry on May 29–30. On May 30, Shields recaptured Front Royal and Jackson began moving his army back to Winchester. Lincoln&#x27;s plan continued to unravel as Banks declared his army was too shaken to move in pursuit (and would remain north of the Potomac until June 10), Frémont moved slowly on poor roads (in contrast to Jackson, whose men had the advantage of the macadamized Valley Pike), and Shields would not leave Front Royal until Ord&#x27;s division arrived. Jackson reached Strasburg before either of the Union armies and the only source of concern was that the Stonewall Brigade had been delayed at Harpers Ferry, but it caught up with the rest of Jackson&#x27;s army after noon on June 1.

On June 2, Union forces pursued Jackson—McDowell up the Luray Valley and Frémont up the main Valley (west of Massanutten Mountain). Jackson&#x27;s men made good time on the Valley Pike, marching more than 40 miles in one 36-hour period, but heavy rains and deep mud delayed their pursuers. For the next five days, frequent clashes occurred between Turner Ashby&#x27;s cavalry (screening the rear of Jackson&#x27;s march) and lead Union cavalry. Ashby also burned some bridges across the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, delaying the Union pursuit and keeping Shields&#x27;s and Frémont&#x27;s forces separated. When contact was reestablished on June 6, Ashby was killed on Chestnut Ridge near Harrisonburg in a skirmish with Frémont&#x27;s cavalry, commanded by Brig. Gen. George D. Bayard. This was a significant loss for the Confederacy since Ashby (the &quot;Black Knight&quot;) was one of its most promising cavalry generals (Ashby having been promoted to brigadier general on June 3). Jackson later wrote, &quot;As a partisan officer, I never knew his superior.&quot;

As the two Union armies converged at the southwestern end of Massanutten Mountain, Jackson had the option of escaping through Brown&#x27;s Gap towards Charlottesville and marching to Richmond, which was closely threatened by McClellan&#x27;s army. However, he was determined to finish his work in the Valley by defeating the two opposing armies in detail. To accomplish this, he recognized that the small town of Port Republic would be crucial. If he could hold or destroy the bridges in this area at the confluence of the South River and North River with the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, he could prevent the two Union armies from combining against him. He positioned most of his army on the high ground overlooking the town from the south bank of the North River, from where his artillery could command the town and fords across the South River, preventing Shields from crossing. He deployed Ewell&#x27;s division on a ridge about 7 miles north near the village of Cross Keys, ready to receive Frémont.

On June 7, Ewell maneuvered in an invitation for Frémont to attack him, but despite receiving a message from his colleague Shields, urging him to &quot;thunder down on [Jackson&#x27;s] rear,&quot; Frémont demurred in the face of Ewell&#x27;s strong position. On Sunday, June 8, Jackson hoped to avoid a fight on the Sabbath, but a raid by Shields&#x27;s cavalry, commanded by Col. Samuel S. Carroll, almost captured the Confederate trains in Port Republic and Jackson himself narrowly escaped by galloping over a bridge across the North River.

===Cross Keys (June 8)===
Frémont moved cautiously to approach Ewell&#x27;s position on the morning of June 8, assuming that he was outnumbered, although he actually outnumbered the Confederates 11,500 to 5,800. (Richard Taylor&#x27;s brigade was detached from Ewell&#x27;s division for service with Jackson.) His men were held up by the determined skirmishers of the 15th Alabama Infantry for over an hour and he was unable to bring up his guns until 10 a.m. His opening artillery barrage was ineffective and did little more than alert Jackson at Port Republic that the battle had started. Frémont&#x27;s men were arranged in a line running southwest to northeast on the Keezletown Road, facing Ewell&#x27;s strong position about a mile south on a ridge behind Mill Creek, with both flanks anchored by dense woods. As they advanced, they wheeled left to become roughly parallel with the Confederate line. At about noon the Federal brigade on the left, commanded by Brig. Gen. Julius Stahel, chased a group of North Carolina skirmishers from Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble&#x27;s brigade across a clearing and up a hill, only to be surprised by a wave of musket fire. The 500 men of the 8th New York Infantry suffered nearly 50% casualties in the engagement.
By mid-afternoon, Frémont had sent only five of his 24 regiments into battle and Ewell expected another attack. The impatient Trimble launched his own offensive against a Union battery, which took his brigade a mile in advance of the rest of Ewell&#x27;s division. He and his men sat there for the rest of the afternoon, inviting an attack that never came. As Frémont withdrew his men back to the Keezletown Road, Ewell decided against a counterattack, knowing that his force was seriously outnumbered. Trimble proposed the idea of a night attack to both Ewell and Jackson, but neither general agreed. The Confederates merely advanced to the previous Union position, ending a battle that, considering the percentage of troops engaged, was little more than a skirmish. Union casualties were 684, Confederate only 288, although two of Ewell&#x27;s brigade commanders, Brig. Gens. Arnold Elzey and George H. Steuart, were badly wounded.

Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s plan for June 9 was to concentrate his forces and overwhelm the outnumbered Shields at Port Republic. He rightly assumed that Frémont would be too shaken to launch a major attack and that he could be held at bay with a mere token force, so he ordered the majority of Ewell&#x27;s division to withdraw under the cover of darkness. They slipped away from Frémont and crossed the North River bridge. A hastily constructed bridge across the South River allowed the Confederates to move into the foggy, flat bottomland below the south bank of the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. The Stonewall Brigade led the advance on the road to Conrad&#x27;s Store, the direction from which Shields would be approaching. Also that morning, Jackson ordered his trains to begin a march into Brown&#x27;s Gap.

===Port Republic (June 9)===
Jackson learned at 7 a.m. that the Federals were approaching his column. Without proper reconnaissance or waiting for the bulk of his force to come up, he ordered Winder&#x27;s Stonewall Brigade to charge through the thinning fog. The brigade was caught between artillery on its flank and rifle volleys to its front and fell back in disarray. They had run into two brigades at the vanguard of Shields&#x27;s army, 3,000 men under Brig. Gen. Erastus B. Tyler. Attempting to extricate himself from a potential disaster, Jackson realized that the Union artillery fire was coming from a spur of the Blue Ridge that was known locally as the Coaling, where charcoal was made by a local family for their blacksmith shop. Jackson and Winder sent the 2nd and 4th Virginia Infantry regiments through the thick underbrush up the hill, where they encountered three Union infantry regiments supporting the artillery and were repulsed.

After his assault on the Coaling failed, Jackson ordered the rest of Ewell&#x27;s division, primarily Trimble&#x27;s brigade, to cross over the North River bridge and burn it behind them, keeping Frémont&#x27;s men isolated to the north of the River. While he waited for these troops to arrive, Jackson reinforced his line with the 7th Louisiana Infantry of Taylor&#x27;s brigade and ordered Taylor to make another attempt against the Union batteries. Winder perceived that the Federals were about to attack, so he ordered a preemptive charge, but in the face of point-blank volleys and running low on ammunition, the Stonewall Brigade was routed. At this point, Ewell arrived on the battlefield and ordered the 44th and 58th Virginia Infantry regiments to strike the left flank of the advancing Union battle line. Tyler&#x27;s men fell back, but reorganized and drove Ewell&#x27;s men into the forest south of the Coaling.

Taylor attacked the infantry and artillery on the Coaling three times before prevailing, but having achieved their objective, were faced by a new charge from three Ohio regiments. It was only the surprise appearance by Ewell&#x27;s troops that convinced Tyler to withdraw his men. The Confederates began bombarding the Union troops on the flat lands, with Ewell himself gleefully manning one of the cannons. More Confederate reinforcements began to arrive, including the brigade of Brig. Gen. William B. Taliaferro, and the Union army reluctantly began to withdraw. Jackson remarked to Ewell, &quot;General, he who does not see the hand of God in this is blind, sir, blind.&quot;
The Battle of Port Republic had been poorly managed by Jackson and was the most damaging to the Confederates in terms of casualties—816 against a force one half his size (about 6,000 to 3,500). Union casualties were 1,002, with a high percentage representing prisoners. Historian Peter Cozzens blames Jackson&#x27;s piecemeal deployment of troops for his heavy losses and argues that it was a battle that did not need to have been fought—the Confederates could have easily burned the North River bridge and slipped into the Blue Ridge via Brown&#x27;s Gap Turnpike without losses. Union soldiers were particularly upset with the performance of their commanders, Shields and Frémont, and both of their military careers faded. Frémont resigned his command just weeks later, rather than be subordinated to his rival Maj. Gen. John Pope. He resigned his commission in June 1864. Shields received no more combat assignments and resigned from the Army in March 1863.

==Aftermath==
After Jackson&#x27;s victories at Cross Keys and Port Republic, the Union forces withdrew. Frémont marched back to Harrisonburg, where he was frustrated to find orders from Lincoln he had not received in time, telling him not to advance beyond that town against Jackson. As the weather became clear, Jackson&#x27;s cavalry under Col. Thomas T. Munford harassed Frémont&#x27;s withdrawal, which reached Mount Jackson on June 11, and then unencumbered to Middletown on June 14 where he joined with Banks and Brig. Gen. Franz Sigel. Shields, who complained bitterly about the exhaustion of his division, marched slowly to Front Royal and on June 21 marched across the Blue Ridge to join Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell.

Jackson sent messages to Richmond requesting that his force be augmented to 40,000 men so that he could assume the offensive down the Valley and across the Potomac. Lee sent him about 14,000 reinforcements, but then revealed his plan to call Jackson to Richmond to counterattack McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac and drive it away from Richmond. He needed all of the combat power he could muster and he wanted Jackson to attack the relatively unprotected right flank of McClellan&#x27;s army, north of the Chickahominy River. Shortly after midnight on June 18, Jackson&#x27;s men began to march toward the Virginia Peninsula. They fought with Lee in the Seven Days Battles, from June 25 to July 1. Jackson delivered an uncharacteristically lethargic performance in many of those battles, perhaps because of the physical strains of the Valley campaign and the exhausting march to Richmond.

With the success of his Valley campaign, Stonewall Jackson became the most celebrated soldier in the Confederacy (until his reputation was eventually eclipsed by Lee&#x27;s), and his victories lifted the morale of the public. In a classic military campaign of surprise and maneuver, he pressed his army to travel 646 miles (1,040 km) in 48 days of marching and won five significant victories with a force of about 17,000 against a combined force of over 50,000. Jackson had accomplished his difficult mission, causing Washington to withhold over 40,000 troops from McClellan&#x27;s offensive. Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones summarized a successful campaign:

On the Union side, a command shakeup resulted from the embarrassing defeat by a smaller force. McDowell&#x27;s corps remained in the defense of Washington, with only one division (under Brig. Gen. George A. McCall) able to join McClellan on the Peninsula. Lincoln was disillusioned by the command difficulties of controlling multiple forces in this campaign and created a single new army, the Army of Virginia, under Maj. Gen. John Pope, incorporating the units of Banks, Frémont, McDowell, and several smaller ones from around Washington and western Virginia. This army was soundly defeated by Lee and Jackson in August at the Second Battle of Bull Run during the northern Virginia campaign.

<text>Babruysk (, ) or Bobruysk (, ; , ) is a city in Mogilev Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Babruysk District, though it is administratively separated from the district. It is situated on the Berezina River. Babruysk occupies an area of , and comprises over 450 streets whose combined length stretches for over . , it has a population of 207,351.Babruysk is located at the intersection of railroads to Asipovichy, Zhlobin, Aktsyabrski and roads to Minsk, Gomel, Mogilev, Kalinkavichy, Slutsk, and Rahachow. It has the biggest timber mill in Belarus, and is also known for its chemical, machine building and metal-working industries.

In 2021, there were 38 public schools in Babruysk, with over 24,000 students. There are three schools specializing in music, dance and visual arts. Additionally, there is a medical school and numerous professional technical schools.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Babruysk&quot; (as well as that of the Babruyka River) probably originates from the Belarusian word (, ), many of which used to inhabit the Berezina. However, beavers in the area had been almost eliminated by the end of the 19th century due to hunting and pollution.

==History==
Babruysk is one of the oldest cities in Belarus. It was first mentioned in writing in the middle of the 14th century. Investigations by archaeologists revealed that in the 5th and 6th centuries there existed Slavic settlements up the river Biarezina from where Babruysk is currently located; findings of stone tools and weapons suggest that people have lived in the area since the Stone Age.

During the reign of Vladimir I, Prince of Kiev, in place of modern-day Babruysk there was a village whose inhabitants were occupied with fishing and beaver trapping. This is where the name Babruysk originated. For many centuries Babruysk was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and was an important militarily fortified border post. In the 14th century a castle was built on one of the hills near the Berezina River.

Babruysk was not only a major military base, but also a prominent trade center. There is evidence of a market containing nearly one hundred stalls, which implies significant financial activity. In the first half of the 17th century Babruysk became a big trade outpost thanks to its strategic position at the intersection of major trade routes and the Berezina river. There was a flowering of skilled tradesmen, including carpenters, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, and bakers. The population in the first half of the 17th century was between 2,000 and 5,000 people.

The town was surrounded by fortifications made from wood and earth, whose length stretched for over . These included a protective earth barrier, wooden walls, and almost a dozen two-story watchtowers. In the walls there were openings designed for the placement of firearms. After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 it came into the hands of Imperial Russia. In 1810, the construction of a fortress began to mark the border between Russia and Austria and Prussia; in 1812 it was almost completed and was successful in repelling Napoleon&#x27;s attack for four months. After the war the building was renewed on a large scale, and it was completed in 1820. That was one of the western Russian fortresses. The Babruysk fortress has served its purpose for many decades and today it is a major tourist attraction.

The 1861 census showed a population of 15,766. The ethnic groups living in Babruysk included Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles, and Jews. As in other cities of Belarus, most of the buildings were constructed from wood. In 1866 there were 1498 houses, only 29 of which were made from brick.

There was a steady increase in the Jewish population of Babruysk following the Napoleonic wars. By 1897, in the population of 34,336 citizens, 60%, or 20,760 were Jews. Most of them were employed in crafts, industry, and trade.

During the 1890s, the citizens of Babruysk witnessed pogroms after the assassination of the Russian emperor Alexander II. Many of the attacks were repelled by armed Jewish self-defense.

In 1902, the Great Fire of Babruysk left 2,500 families homeless and destroyed over 250 business, 15 schools and the market. There were more than 7 million rubles in property damage, however the city was quickly rebuilt, this time with brick and stone.

In 1904 the 40th Infantry Division of the Imperial Russian Army had its headquarters here.

Between February 2 and March 11, 1918, was a Battle of Bobrujsk, between units of the Polish I Corps in Russia, commanded by General Jozef Dowbor-Musnicki, fought with the Red Army over the control of the city and region of Babruysk. 
In 1918–1920, town was captured by Polish forces.



===World War II===
On 28 June 1941, troops of the German Army Group Centre captured Babruysk. General Gotthard Heinrici considered the largely-evacuated city &quot;a dump consisting mainly of wooden houses&quot; and was appalled by the &quot;extremely primitive&quot; surrounding area. 
Dulag 131, one of the largest camps for Soviet prisoners of war, was located in the &quot;citadel&quot;. An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Red Army soldiers died there.

Believing that German troops would not target civilians, many Jews stayed behind. Consequently, 20,000 Babruysk Jews were shot and buried in mass graves. Ghetto and labor camps were established in the southwest part of town. The conditions inside the camps were horrible and involved lack of food, lack of sanitation and perpetual abuse by the Nazi guards. Soon the Nazis began executing the Jews in the ghetto in groups of about 30. By 1943 all labor camps had been liquidated and the remaining Jews killed. The few Jews who escaped joined partisan forces in the surrounding forest and went about attacking enemy railroad lines. There is a small memorial dedicated to the memory of Babruysk Jews killed in the Holocaust, located in the Nahalat Yitzhak cemetery, Giv&#x27;atayim, Israel, as part of the Babi Yar memorial.

On June 29, 1944, the Red Army liberated Babruysk. The city lay in ruins; while the population had been 84,107 in 1939, it was down to 28,352 following the war. The difficult process of rebuilding was conducted by thousands of workers and war prisoners who labored to clear factories and streets of rubble and filled in craters made by the bombardment. The machine building plant had been almost completely destroyed, but was restored to working order by the end of 1944. Many other factories and facilities were also rebuilt.
===Postwar era===
Between 1944 and 1954, Babruysk served as an administrative center of Babruysk Voblast.

The population recovered swiftly as well. In 1959 it was 96,000, in 1965 – 116,000, in 1968 – 122,500, in 1970 – 136,000 and by 1989, 232,000 people were living in Babruysk. This was mostly due to urbanization, where people moved into the city from the surrounding rural areas.

==Climate==
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Babruysk has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Turner Ashby Jr. (October 23, 1828 – June 6, 1862) was a Confederate cavalry commander in the American Civil War. 

In his youth, he organized an informal cavalry company known as the Mountain Rangers, which became part of the 7th Virginia Cavalry (&quot;Ashby&#x27;s Cavalry&quot;). On the outbreak of the Civil War, Ashby and his troopers were assigned to the Virginia Militia command of Colonel Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. Although Jackson&#x27;s Valley campaign owed much to Ashby&#x27;s reconnaissance and screening, Ashby was criticized by Jackson for the lax training and discipline of his men. By the time Ashby was killed, leading his men at the Battle of Good&#x27;s Farm near Harrisonburg, he had received his general’s star. However, Ashby&#x27;s official rank is contested as the promotion was not confirmed until after his death.

==Early years==
Turner Ashby Jr. was born at Rose Bank Plantation near Markham in Fauquier County, Virginia, to Turner Ashby Sr. and Dorothea Green Ashby. As a child he often played in the waters of nearby Goose Creek, and had a pet wolf named &quot;Lupus&quot; that neighbors demanded he get rid of. His father died when he was young, so his mother hired Mr. Underwood as a tutor for Turner and his brother, then sent him to Major Ambler&#x27;s school nearby, but Ashby preferred wandering the countryside rather than classes. In later years, he bought a residence near his childhood home and named it Wolfe&#x27;s Crag. An accomplished horseman at an early age, Ashby often participated in tournaments, and won many, including once dressed as an Indian chief and riding with neither bridle nor saddle.

With Mr. Sommerville as partner, Ashby ran a mill on his father&#x27;s property until his mother sold it to neighbor Edward Carrington Marshall of the Manassas Gap Railroad. Ashby enjoyed modest success at both business and farming.

==Virginia militiaman==
Knowing that his father had fought as a colonel in the War of 1812, and his grandfather Jack Ashby served as a captain during the American Revolutionary War, Ashby while in his 20s organized a cavalry company of his friends that became known as the &quot;Mountain Rangers,&quot; initially to keep order among laborers on the Manassas Gap Railroad, some of whom tended to get into drunken brawls. Among the Rangers were E.C. Marshall&#x27;s nephews Thomas Marshall, James Jones Marshall and Lewis Fielding Marshall (all grandsons of Chief Justice John Marshall, who mostly resided in Richmond, Virginia or Washington, D.C., but spent the summers at his Oak Hill plantation in Fauquier County run by his son and later this grandson Thomas Marshall, also a member of the Rangers and who would die in battle in late 1864). Upon learning of John Brown&#x27;s raid at Harpers Ferry, the Mountain Rangers met at Harper&#x27;s Ferry, where some performed guard duty at Charles Town during Brown&#x27;s trial and execution and the unit was formally absorbed into the Virginia Militia. Ashby later told his friend Major Lewis A. Armistead that the Civil War really began with John Brown&#x27;s insurrection, and that those behind Brown would keep on until they forced the South to secede.

Ashby avidly followed politics and ran for the state legislature, but as a Whig (the minority party in Fauquier County) and follower of Henry Clay, he failed to win election. After the start of the Civil War, though he&#x27;d disapproved of secession, when it became obvious that Virginia would secede, Ashby told his Mountain Rangers to again meet at Harper&#x27;s Ferry. This time they became Company A of the 7th Virginia Cavalry, also known as &quot;Ashby&#x27;s Brigade&quot; or the &quot;Laurel Brigade&quot; after a common plant in Virginia&#x27;s Mountains. Ashby soon persuaded Governor John Letcher to order the militia to capture the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. When secession was approved, Ashby made his move, but U.S. forces burned most of the arsenal buildings and 15,000 small arms before he could arrive.

==Civil War==
At Harpers Ferry, Ashby was assigned to the Virginia Militia command of Colonel Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, whom he had met at Harpers Ferry and Charles Town in 1859. Ashby was initially assigned to guard fords across the Potomac River and bridges from Harpers Ferry to Point of Rocks, Maryland. He became known for visiting his pickets on long horseback rides (50-miles while guarding the Potomac, later 70 miles when guarding Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s rear during the Valley Campaign), as well as for interfering with scouting operations of various Union forces. Ashby&#x27;s men assisted Maryland men with Confederate sympathies to pass into Virginia, and they disrupted railroad traffic on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as well as interfered with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (including blowing up Dam No. 5 upon Jackson&#x27;s orders when others had failed). Ashby&#x27;s brother Richard was killed skirmishing with a Union patrol along the Potomac in June 1861. Hearing rumors that his brother had been bayoneted while trying to surrender, Ashby examined the corpse, came to hate Northerners and became obsessed with revenge.

On July 23, 1861, Brigadier General Joseph E. Johnston appointed Ashby lieutenant colonel of the 7th Virginia Cavalry. Due to the illness of the regimental commander, Col. Angus McDonald, Ashby had effective control of half of the regiment, which he operated separately. When the commander retired in February 1862, Ashby assumed command of the entire regiment on March 12. Ashby organized the first Confederate horse artillery, named Chew&#x27;s Battery, as part of this regiment. The 7th did not participate directly in the First Battle of Manassas, arriving on July 22, but Ashby aided the Confederate cause by screening the movement of Johnston&#x27;s army to the Manassas area. The Union had hoped that Johnston&#x27;s forces would be pinned down by Major General Robert Patterson, but Ashby&#x27;s screen allowed Johnston to move freely without Patterson&#x27;s interference. In October 1861, Ashby led an attack on Harpers Ferry, the armory having returned to Union control, but lost to Union forces led by Colonel John W. Geary in what became known as the &quot;Battle of Bolivar Heights&quot;.

By the spring of 1862, the 7th Virginia Cavalry had reached the enormous size of 27 infantry and cavalry companies, much larger than a typical Civil War regiment, plus Ashby lacked staff officers and had lax discipline despite his tireless patrols of the long picket lines. Stonewall Jackson, in overall command of the Shenandoah Valley, tried to strip Ashby of his cavalry forces, ordering them to be assigned to two infantry brigades. When Ashby threatened to resign in protest, Jackson backed down. Jackson continued to resist Ashby&#x27;s promotion to brigadier general, due to his informal military training and lax discipline. Nevertheless, Ashby&#x27;s promotion came through on May 23, 1862, and he received his promotion and general&#x27;s star in a ceremony at the Taylor Hotel in Winchester, Virginia.
Ashby&#x27;s vigorous reconnaissance and screening were factors in the success of Jackson&#x27;s Valley campaign in the Shenandoah Valley in 1862. However, Ashby failed Jackson in some instances. At the First Battle of Kernstown, Jackson attacked a retreating Union column that Ashby had estimated to be four regiments of infantry, about the size of Jackson&#x27;s force. It turned out to be an entire division of 9,000 men, and Jackson was forced to retreat. At the First Battle of Winchester, as Union forces under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks were retreating, Ashby failed to cut off their retreat because his troopers were plundering captured wagons.

As Jackson&#x27;s army withdrew from the pressure of Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont&#x27;s superior forces, moving from Harrisonburg toward Port Republic, Ashby commanded the rear guard. On June 6, 1862, near Harrisonburg, the 1st New Jersey Cavalry attacked Ashby&#x27;s position at Good&#x27;s Farm. Although Ashby defeated the cavalry attack, the following infantry engagement resulted in his horse being shot, so Ashby charged ahead on foot. After only a few steps, he was shot through the heart, killing him instantly. (The origin of the fatal shot remains unclear. Soldiers of the 13th Pennsylvania Reserve Infantry, the &quot;Bucktails&quot;, claimed credit, but some accounts blame it on friendly fire.) His last words were &quot;Charge, men! For God&#x27;s sake. Charge!&quot; waving his sword, when a bullet pierced him in the breast and he fell dead.&quot;
He had been appointed brigadier general just two weeks before his death. Although he is sometimes referred to as a general and his name often appears in lists of Confederate generals, his appointment as brigadier general was never confirmed by the Confederate Senate. He died two weeks after his appointment and the Confederate Senate did not act to confirm the appointment during that time.

==Legacy==

Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s report of the engagement sums up the man (although considering Jackson&#x27;s resistance to Ashby&#x27;s promotion, the eulogy might be an exaggeration in favor of the young man):

Ashby was buried at the University of Virginia Cemetery, but in October 1866, his body was reinterred at the Stonewall Cemetery in Winchester, Virginia, next to the body of his younger brother Richard Ashby, who was killed in Hampshire County in a skirmish with Union soldiers in 1861. The Turner Ashby Monument can be found in Harrisonburg, Virginia, at the spot where Ashby was fatally shot in the Battle of Harrisonburg at Chestnut Ridge.

In 1914 the Neale Publishing Company published &quot;Life of Turner Ashby&quot;, a biography of Ashby by his kinsman Thomas Ashby.

Turner Ashby High School, in Bridgewater, Virginia, is named after the general.

<text>The Achilles tendon or heel cord, also known as the calcaneal tendon, is a tendon at the back of the lower leg, and is the thickest in the human body. It serves to attach the plantaris, gastrocnemius (calf) and soleus muscles to the calcaneus (heel) bone. These muscles, acting via the tendon, cause plantar flexion of the foot at the ankle joint, and (except the soleus) flexion at the knee.

Abnormalities of the Achilles tendon include inflammation (Achilles tendinitis), degeneration, rupture, and becoming embedded with cholesterol deposits (xanthomas).

The Achilles tendon was named in 1693 after the Greek hero Achilles.

== History ==

The oldest-known written record of the tendon being named after Achilles is in 1693 by the Flemish/Dutch anatomist Philip Verheyen. In his widely used text he described the tendon&#x27;s location and said that it was commonly called &quot;the cord of Achilles.&quot; The tendon has been described as early as the time of Hippocrates, who described it as the &quot;&quot; (Latin for &quot;great tendon&quot;) and by subsequent anatomists prior to Verheyen as &quot;&quot; (Latin for &quot;Hippocrates&#x27; string&quot;).

Verheyen referred to the mythological account of Achilles being held by the heel by his mother Thetis when she dipped him in the River Styx as a baby to render his body invulnerable. As the heel by which she held him was not touched by the water, it was his one vulnerable spot (hence the expression &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot;) and he was eventually killed by a poison dart to the heel. The name thus also refers to the particularly disabling and painful effect of an injury to this tendon. The first closed rupture was described by Ambroise Pare in the sixteenth century.

The Achilles tendon is also known as the &quot;&quot; (Latin for &quot;calcaneal tendon&quot;). Because eponyms (names relating to people) have no relationship to the subject matter, most anatomical eponyms also have scientifically descriptive terms. The term calcaneal comes from the Latin , meaning heel.

== Structure ==

The Achilles tendon connects muscle to bone, like other tendons, and is located at the back of the lower leg. The Achilles tendon connects the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to the calcaneal tuberosity on the calcaneus (heel bone). The tendon begins near the middle of the calf, and receives muscle fibers on its inner surface, particularly from the soleus muscle, almost to its lower end. Gradually thinning below, it inserts into the middle part of the back of the calcaneus bone. The tendon spreads out somewhat at its lower end so that its narrowest part is about above its insertion.

The tendon is covered by the fascia and skin, and stands out prominently behind the bone; the gap is filled up with areolar and adipose tissue. A bursa lies between the tendon and the upper part of the calcaneus. It is about long.

Along the side of the muscle, and superficial to it, is the small saphenous vein. The sural nerve accompanies the small saphenous vein as it descends in the posterior leg, traveling inferolateral to it as it crosses the lateral border of the Achilles tendon. The tendon is the thickest tendon in the human body. It can receive a load stress 3.9 times body weight during walking and 7.7 times body weight when running.

The blood supply to the Achilles tendon is poor, and mostly via a recurrent branch of the posterior tibial artery, and some through arterial branches passing through surrounding muscles.

== Function ==

Acting via the Achilles tendon, the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles cause plantar flexion of the foot at the ankle. This action brings the sole of the foot closer to the back of the leg. The gastrocnemius also flexes the leg at the knee. Both muscles are innervated by the tibial nerve. Because the fibres of the tendon spiral about 90 degrees, fibres from the gastrocnemius tend to attach to the outer part of the bone, whereas fibres from the soleus tend to attach closer to the midline.

Vibration of the tendon without vision has a major impact on postural orientation. Vibration of the tendon causes movement backwards and the illusion of a forward body tilt in standing subjects. This is because vibrations stimulate muscle spindles in the calf muscles. The muscle spindles alert the brain that the body is moving forward, so the central nervous system compensates by moving the body backwards.

== Clinical significance ==
=== Inflammation ===
Inflammation of the Achilles tendon is called Achilles tendinitis. Achilles tendinosis is the soreness or stiffness of the tendon, particularly worse when exercising, and generally due to overuse. The most common symptoms are sharp achy pain and swelling around the affected tendon. The pain is typically worse at the start of exercise and decreases thereafter. Stiffness of the ankle may also be present. Onset is generally gradual.

It commonly occurs as a result of overuse such as running. Other risk factors include trauma, a lifestyle that includes little exercise, high-heel shoes, rheumatoid arthritis, and medications of the fluoroquinolone or steroid class. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and examination.

While stretching and exercises to strengthen the back are often recommended for prevention, evidence to support these measures is poor. Treatment typically involves rest, ice, non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. A heel lift or orthotics may also be helpful. In those in whose symptoms last more than six months despite other treatments, surgery may be considered. Achilles tendinitis is relatively common.

=== Degeneration ===

Achilles tendon degeneration (tendinosis) is typically investigated with either MRI or ultrasound. In both cases, the tendon is thickened, may demonstrate surrounding inflammation by virtue of the presence of paratenonitis, retrocalcaneal or retro-achilles bursitis. Within the tendon, increased blood flow, tendon fibril disorganisation, and partial thickness tears may be identified. Achilles tendinosis frequently involves the mid portion of the tendon but may involve the insertion, which is then known as enthesopathy. Though enthesopathy may be seen in the context of advancing age, it is also associated with arthritis such as gout and the seronegative spondyloarthritides. Achilles tendinosis is a known risk factor for calf muscle tears.

=== Rupture ===
Achilles tendon rupture is when the Achilles tendon breaks. Symptoms include the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel. A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking becomes difficult.

Rupture typically occurs as a result of a sudden bending up of the foot when the calf muscle is engaged, direct trauma, or long-standing tendonitis. Other risk factors include the use of fluoroquinolones, a significant change in exercise, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or corticosteroid use. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and examination and supported by medical imaging. Achilles tendon rupture occurs in about 1 per 10,000 people per year. Males are more commonly affected than females. People in their 30s to 50s are most commonly affected.

Prevention may include stretching before activity. Treatment may be by surgery or casting with the toes somewhat pointed down. Relatively rapid return to weight bearing (within 4 weeks) appears acceptable. The risk of re-rupture is about 25% with casting. If appropriate treatment does not occur within 4 weeks of the injury outcomes suffer.

=== Xanthomas ===

Tendon xanthomas are cholesterol deposits that commonly develop in the Achilles tendon of people with lipid metabolism disorders such as familial hypercholesterolemia.

=== Neurological exam ===

The Achilles tendon is often tested as part of a neurological examination. In this examination, the tendon is hit with a tendon hammer. This tests the S1 and S2 spinal nerves: a normal response is plantar flexion (downward movement) of the foot.

Level or portion of tendon affected:

* Paratendinopathy: The inflammation of a connective tissue sleeve which surrounds the tendon and protects it from friction, irritation, and repeated trauma
* Insertional: Eminently overuse-injury which frequently occurs in running and jumping athletes. Patients affected by insertional Achilles tendinopathy complain of pain on the posterior aspect of the heel and may have morning stiffness, swelling with activity and tenderness at the tendon insertion level. If this condition becomes chronic, calcific deposits at the Achilles insertional level may be developed (due to microfractures and healing of the osteotendinous union) which can degenerate, if it persists over time, in the abnormal bony prominence on the posterior aspect of heel, condition known as Haglund deformity, which can be painful and difficult close-shoes fitting due to friction and irritation.
* Mid-portion: Occurs approximately 2–7 cm proximal from the Achilles insertion into the calcaneus. Characterized by a combination of pain and swelling at this level. It has associated a remarkable impaired performance.

== Other animals ==

The Achilles tendon is short or absent in great apes, but long in arboreal gibbons and humans. It provides elastic energy storage in hopping, walking, and running. Computer models suggest this energy storage Achilles tendon increases top running speed by &gt;80% and reduces running costs by more than 75%. It has been suggested that the &quot;absence of a well-developed Achilles tendon in the nonhuman African apes would preclude them from effective running, both at high speeds and over extended distances.&quot;

<doc id="380170" wikidata="Q3042901" url="?curid=380170" title="Johan Bernhard Hjort">
<text>Johan Bernhard Hjort (25 February 1895 – 24 February 1969) was a Norwegian supreme court lawyer. He is known for co-founding Nasjonal Samling in 1933, his later resistance work against Nazi Germany, including his work to help Scandinavian prisoners, as well as for his role as one of the country&#x27;s leading defense attorneys after the war. 

Hjort joined Harald Nørregaard&#x27;s law firm in 1932 and after 1945 continued the firm as Advokatfirmaet Hjort. He was deputy leader of Nasjonal Samling from 1933, and from 1935 he served as the leader of Hirden, the party&#x27;s paramilitary wing. However, he broke with the party in 1937 and was arrested by the Gestapo in 1941. He was then sent to Germany, where he was interned at the Gross Kreutz estate together with Didrik Arup Seip, and carried out resistance work that saved the lives of many Scandinavian prisoners. Among other things, the group at Gross Kreutz collected lists of names of Scandinavian prisoners, and these formed the basis for the rescue operation with the white buses.

After the war, he was notable as a defender of homosexual rights and as a defender of controversial artists&#x27; freedom of expression, as in the so-called Red Ruby controversy. From 1961 until his death, he was chairman of Riksmålsforbundet. As a public figure, he stood for a liberal worldview, sharply criticizing the Labor Party governments of the 1950s and 1960s.

==Family and background==

He was the son of marine biologist, oceanographer, and director of fisheries, Johan Hjort and his wife Wanda Maria von der Marwitz. His mother was of Prussian nobility. During Johan&#x27;s childhood, the family lived in Bergen, and his parents divorced when he was in his teens. The children moved with their mother to Bestum in Oslo.

In 1920, he married Anna Cathrine Holst. His two sisters Astrid and Wanda soon after married German men: the two brothers Rüdiger and Georg Conrad Graf von der Goltz, and moved to Germany. Astrid&#x27;s husband, Rüdiger von der Goltz, was from 1936 a member of the Reichstag for the NSDAP. The sisters&#x27; father-in-law was the prominent General Rüdiger von der Goltz, who led the Freikorps in the Baltic States and the German intervention in the Finnish Civil War.

Hjort had six children with his wife: social worker and resistance member Wanda Hjort Heger, Supreme Court lawyer Johan Hjort, doctor, professor and politician Peter F. Hjort, engineer Helge Hjort, pianist Kirsti Hjort and psychologist Haldis Hjort. He is the grandfather of publisher Anders Heger and district court judge Kim Heger.

== Early life and career ==
Hjort began studying law and graduated in 1919 with a cand.jur., equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree. Shortly after graduating, Hjort was employed by the law firm Bredal, Fougner and Schjødt, which at the time was one of Oslo&#x27;s leading firms. After a year, he was asked to leave in order to gain more experience as a temporary judge. Hjort then worked for a year in Aker before joining the Union of Norwegian Cities (, now KS) as a legal consultant. 

Following the First World War, Norway experienced significant economic troubles. Through his position at the Union of Norwegian Cities, Hjort gained in-depth knowledge of the poor finances of the municipalities and the state. Together with his friend Trygve Hoff (later editor of Farmand), Hjort prepared an alternative state budget in 1923 to improve the budget overview. As a result, he was eventually tasked with an investigation assignment for Johan Egeberg Mellbye in the Farmers&#x27; Party and a position as an advisor for the Lykke government under Finance Minister Fredrik Ludvig Konow. 

As Hjort prepared his economic reports, focused on the state&#x27;s poor finances and the politicians&#x27; inability to balance the budget deficit, his confidence in the existing non-socialist parties weakened. In 1927, Hjort joined the Fatherland League and was elected to the Aker county council for the Conservative Party. In the 1930 parliamentary elections, Hjort campaigned for a non-socialist victory, and attacking revolutionary aspects of the Labour Party. Responding to an article by Edvard Bull Sr. (Labor Party politician and later Foreign Minister) in the journal Vor Verden, Hjort argued that one could not give power to an admitted revolutionary party even if it won the election, as this would be tantamount to &quot;bolshevism by parliamentary means&quot; ().

Though the non-socialists won the election in 1930, the economic crisis (now global in the form of the Great Depression) was becoming increasingly serious and unemployment was rising. In the spring of 1931, this led to a major lockout by employers. The crisis and what Hjort perceived as a weak response from the establishment parties lead him towards the more radical right-wing.

In 1932, Hjort was admitted as a partner in Harald Nørregaard&#x27;s law firm, which was subsequently renamed Nørregaard &amp; Hjort. Nørregaard was regarded as one of Norway&#x27;s leading supreme court lawyers of his time. Hjort&#x27;s biographer, Ivo de Figueiredo, writes: &quot;In Nørregaard he found a role model. The elderly lawyer was known for his eloquence in court. It was said of him that he dominated the courtroom with his presence, and that his warm voice wrapped itself around the Court of Appeal like velvet.&quot; Nørregaard died after six years of partnership in 1938. Nørregaard and Hjort had a somewhat distant family relationship - Nørregaard&#x27;s grandmother was married to Hjort&#x27;s great-grandfather.

==Involvement with Nasjonal Samling==
=== Beginning ===
Hjort was in contact with a circle of concerned establishment figures, to which Vidkun Quisling had also been invited. From the spring of 1930, they met for dinner at Frederik Prytz&#x27;s house at Hafrsfjordsgaten 7. In May 1931, Quisling was appointed Minister of Defense in Peder L. Kolstad&#x27;s government, formed by the Farmers&#x27; Party. During the throne speech in April 1932, Quisling gave a speech in the Storting in which he accused the two socialist parties (the Labor Party, DNA, and the Communist Party of Norway, NKP) of treasonous connections with the Soviet Union. The circle around Prytz attempted to use the speech to promote Quisling&#x27;s political position and weaken the socialist parties.

In May 1932, the circle from Hafrsfjordsgate formed an informal group called &quot;Polkom&quot;; from Hjort&#x27;s office, this group worked to exploit Quisling&#x27;s accusations and information against the two socialist parties. This marked the start of Hjort&#x27;s period of close collaboration with Quisling. Polkom&#x27;s work was aimed at getting the non-socialist parties to declare DNA and NKP illegal, as they aimed to overthrow the system. During the summer and fall, Hjort developed a plan, based on constitutional theory, for a coup d&#x27;état carried out by the government against the Storting. Under this plan, parliamentarism was to be abolished and the threat from the socialists neutralized.

Hjort&#x27;s basis for taking such drastic action was his sense of crisis. As Hjort saw it, the plan was constitutionally legitimate, and he saw a unifying anti-socialist leader in Vidkun Quisling. To showcase the constitutional legality of the coup d&#x27;état plan, Hjort referred to 1814, 1884 and 1905; three major years in Norwegian political history. However, the success of the plan depended on broad support, and to ensure this, a meeting was held on 26 October 1932 at the home of landowner Carl Otto Løvenskiold at Bærums Verk.

Present at this meeting were the leaders of various non-socialist parties and organizations. The meeting later became known as the &quot;Wednesday meeting&quot;. Hjort introduced and presented the plan, but it was negatively received by the old Conservative prime minister Jens Bratlie, and it also led to prominent supporter Johan Throne Holst (noteworthy industrialist and CEO of Freia) withdrawing. Over the course of the fall and winter, the plan collapsed as Quisling and new Prime Minister Jens Hundseid clashed over the pacifist Captain Kullmann in what became known as the &quot;Kullmann case&quot;. This was the first blow to Hjort&#x27;s faith in Quisling.

=== Founding of Nasjonal Samling ===
Jens Hundseid&#x27;s government fell in March 1933, and Polkom - in which Hjort played a central role - explored the possibility of a broad non-socialist coalition that would include the Farmers&#x27; Party, the Fatherland League, and others. However, a lack of interest in this front meant that on 17 May, in the newspaper Tidens Tegn, Quisling presented a program for a separate party, Nasjonal Samling. As de facto deputy leader of the new party, Hjort threw himself into the election campaign for the 1933 general election, in which his wife Anna Cathrine also participated.

The newly founded party did not get any MPs. Hjort lamented about Quisling&#x27;s leadership style, which he felt was unclear and amateurish. In the spring of 1934, NS made a new attempt at non-socialist cooperation, led by Hjort. However, these negotiations were unsuccessful, and in March 1935 the Labor Party formed a government with the support of the Farmers&#x27; Party.

In addition to his legal practice, Hjort continued to work organizationally for NS. He also investigated how laws and the Constitution must be amended to meet &quot;the demands of the new era&quot;. He also put forward a proposal in the spring of 1935 to reintroduce the &quot;Jew clause&quot; (a historical ban excluding Jews from Norway) in the Constitution. Despite the fact that Hjort was a co-founder and de facto deputy leader of NS, his ideas about the organization of the state were in theory within the limits of democracy. Hjort was also not a supporter of a planned economy, and he distanced himself from German National Socialism.

In March 1935, Hjort took over the leadership of Hirden, who partly acted as security guards at NS meetings, but whose primary task was to discipline and educate its members. Hirden was modeled after the German  (SA). With his Prussian background, sergeant training from the Armed Forces and natural authority, Hjort was made for the role. Hirden was the activist core of NS, with a couple hundred members. At a meeting in Gjøvik on Ascension Day 1936, Hjort addressed several thousand attendees and opened with &quot;Countrymen, traitors, monkeys and others&quot;. The meeting ended in chaos and street fighting, the so-called Torgslaget.

=== Internal struggle and break with NS ===
Johan Bernhard Hjort had little patience with people he regarded as &quot;fools&quot; or amateurish, and he believed there were many of them in NS. In addition, Hjort was an able organizer, and a good speaker. Quisling&#x27;s lack of these qualities was very problematic for the party. A battle for the leadership of NS was therefore inevitable.

In the summer of 1936, Hjort traveled to Germany to seek support for NS. Probably with the help of his German brothers-in-law, he met Heinrich Himmler, among others. He was well received, but received no financial support. However, Himmler offered to link NS to the German SS, which Hjort is said to have rejected.

Back in Norway, he became involved in the NS action against Trotsky. Hirden broke into Konrad Knudsen&#x27;s house in Hønefoss, where Trotsky lived, and took a number of documents that Hjort handed over to the police. The case attracted enormous attention and was for NS a successful provocation. NS&#x27;s fight against communism and Judaism took center stage, and Trotsky was eventually expelled.

In the election campaign before the 1936 general election, Hjort gave everything. At the same time, he was under pressure from internal intrigues in NS and the knowledge that he was neglecting his family in favor of politics. However, NS had a poor showing in the election and was once again left without MPs. In the internal dispute that followed, Hjort proposed far-reaching organizational changes. Hjort&#x27;s proposals were rejected, and in the fall of 1936 the conflict between him and NS intensified. In February 1937, he left the party, and several other key figures left NS at this time as well.

== Prelude to war ==
On 14 June 1937, Himmler visited the lawyer Rüdiger von der Goltz (Hjort&#x27;s brother-in-law) to meet Hjort and be briefed on the National Socialist movement in Norway. 

The years of hectic political activity had a negative effect on Hjort&#x27;s law practice; his finances had been supported by his wife&#x27;s uncle Johan Throne Holst, a debt he now had to work to pay off. Hjort kept in contact with other NS breakaways, and he wrote for the right-wing, nationalist and NS-critical journal Ragnarok.

The Kristallnacht of 9 November 1938 shocked Hjort; &quot;Germany&#x27;s friends are looking for an honorable defense and a reasonable motive for all this. They refuse to believe that German order and discipline have come to an end and that the German state must give the people this kind of circus performance for the sake of domestic peace.&quot; At the same time, Hjort had accepted the Nuremberg Laws and argued in the autumn of 1938 that a race war was looming, with the &quot;Nordic tribe in the world decreasing in numbers, while other races multiply like rats&quot;.

In September 1939, World War II broke out, and in November the Winter War began with the Soviet Union&#x27;s attack on Finland. Germany had signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviets and therefore remained passive, which was a hard blow for Hjort. Several of Hjort&#x27;s friends, including his father, traveled to Finland as volunteers. He considered going himself, but decided against it for the sake of his family. Up until 1940, Hjort was engaged in strengthening the armed forces, and he and his two sons received voluntary military training themselves.

== German invasion ==
On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Norway. Hjort was a conscripted sergeant and reported for duty, but like so many others, he was told to wait. In the evening, he heard his former colleague Vidkun Quisling declare on the radio that a new national government had taken over. Greatly provoked, Hjort contacted other pro-German Norwegians: Victor Mogens, Per Imerslund, Albert Wiesener, Otto Sverdrup Engelschiøn and Hans S. Jacobsen. Hjort&#x27;s plan was to contact the Germans to stop Quisling&#x27;s coup attempt.

On 14 April, the Administrative Council was established, and Quisling&#x27;s coup attempt had failed. During the spring, Hjort began working to help and release the Norwegian prisoners of war. By the end of May 1940, 11,000 Norwegian prisoners of war had been released. However, the work came at a price, as the officers had to swear an oath not to take up arms against the occupying forces. Hjort was later criticized for this, and a number of officers, led by Otto Ruge, chose captivity instead. Hjort was also an active writer in &quot;Tidens Tegn&quot;. He was most outspoken in &quot;Ragnarok&quot;, where he wrote that one had to be optimistic and build the country; as &quot;then both Norway&#x27;s independence and a friendly relationship with our kindred people in the south will come as a matter of course.&quot;

In the unclear situation after the invasion, Hjort was well suited as a middleman as he was both a respected Supreme Court lawyer and fluent in German. Hjort also dealt with finding work for the released prisoners and with insurance settlements after the fighting through the War Injury Insurance Fund. During the summer of 1940, Hjort was constantly involved in the various negotiations between the German and Norwegian sides. These culminated in Terboven&#x27;s proposal for a . Hjort was open to a position on this council, but withdrew when Terboven demanded that NS be represented.

As late as August 1940, Hjort attempted to bring the major parties together, and he had meetings with representatives of the Conservative Party, the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the Farmers&#x27; Party. He was not alone in his desire to make the best of the situation. Einar Gerhardsen had similar ideas, but they were quickly torpedoed by the Germans when Terboven declared on 25 September that Nasjonal Samling was Norway&#x27;s only legal political party.

=== Imprisonment ===
With clear lines drawn after Terboven&#x27;s speech, Hjort withdrew from party politics for the last time and devoted all his time to law. With his knowledge of German affairs, he was a resource for other Norwegian lawyers. There were many cases when Norwegian resistance fighters needed defence counsel. It was a legal voyage through increasingly troubled waters; the Supreme Court was dismissed, and the occupation forces were constantly pushing for lawyers to adapt to the new conditions. He also held lectures in the German-controlled Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, alongside individuals like Albert Wiesener, Jonas Lie, and Ranik Halle.

In January 1941, the Norwegian Bar Association was pressured to include an article in the Norwegian Legal Gazette on &quot;The development of constitutional law in Norway&quot; by Rudolf Schiedermair, Terboven&#x27;s legal adviser. Hjort took it upon himself to write a response with the assistance of other Norwegian lawyers and Frede Castberg. Hjort&#x27;s response was diplomatic in form, but nevertheless ruthless when Hjort concluded that the Germans had violated international law by their conduct during the occupation, and that Quisling had committed a coup d&#x27;état.

Hjort must have known what such public criticism of the occupying forces would lead to, and he was arrested on 21 October 1941. Hjort was first detained at Møllergata 19 (Oslo&#x27;s main police station at the time) and then transferred to the Grini prison camp in December 1941. The time in solitary confinement at Møllergata 19 was a difficult period for Hjort, but the community at Grini with many acquaintances made his imprisonment easier. In fact, many of the most important of the Norwegian social elite were at Grini. After the liberation, it was seen as a badge of honor to have been imprisoned there. From then on, Johan Bernhard Hjort was definitely considered to have been on &quot;the right side&quot; of the war.

In Germany, his brothers-in-law tried to get him released, and Rüdiger was allowed to meet Terboven in November 1941. But the German Reichskommissar was outraged and stated: &quot;The pig sits down and writes an article&quot; (.) Hjort&#x27;s attempts to speak out against the occupation forces were not taken kindly. At the same time, his arrest was also linked to his brother-in-law Johan Holst&#x27;s escape to Sweden.

On 6 February 1942, Hjort was sent to Germany on the prison ship &quot;Donau&quot; and placed in the prison at Alexanderplatz in Berlin. Hjort&#x27;s brother-in-law Rüdiger approached Himmler, and the SS commander was open to an agreement that resulted in Hjort being released, but having to stay in Germany with his family until the end of the war.

In May, Rüdiger was allowed to meet Hjort to explain the conditions, but Hjort&#x27;s family in Norway, Anna Cathrine and the six children were reluctant to settle in Germany.

Anna Cathrine Hjort was allowed to meet her husband in Berlin, but she and the children were equally dismissive. There were rumors and many people believed that Hjort was now willing to cooperate with the occupiers. Hjort was released, but in so-called civilian internment. Rüdiger got him a job as a legal consultant in the oil company Continentale Oehl Gesellschaft in Berlin. By October, after strong German pressure, the family had given in and settled on the Gross Kreutz estate in the village of the same name 20 km west of Potsdam. The estate was owned by Hjort&#x27;s cousin Bodo von der Marwitz.

== Resistance work ==
While they were in their &quot;open captivity&quot; as civilian internees in Germany, the Hjort family tried to make the best of the situation. In consultation with the Norwegian seaman priests in Hamburg, Arne Berge and Conrad Vogt-Svendsen, their daughter Wanda took the initiative to visit Norwegian prisoners. She began with a visit to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Prison camps were visited, and the prisoners were given parcels, and messages and names were smuggled out.

The first prisoner Wanda visited was Didrik Arup Seip, who was eventually released and interned on the same terms as Hjort. He moved with his family to the Gross Kreutz estate near Potsdam, where Hjort and his family also lived and joined in the work for the prisoners.

From January 1944, the family established contact with the Norwegian diplomat Niels Christian Ditleff in Stockholm. Through Swedish diplomatic channels, they sent him around 50 reports with lists of names. Seip and his children were the leaders in this prisoner work, but Hjort himself also became involved as a defender of Norwegian prisoners in Germany. Among the prisoners he assisted were members of the Wollweber group.

On 26 October 1944, Ditleff received a memo from Hjort requesting that the Norwegian prisoners be taken to Sweden, and shortly afterwards Ditleff sent a memo reporting German plans to liquidate all prisoners before the end of the war. These notes were crucial to the Swedish rescue operation known as the White Buses. It is estimated that this operation saved 15,345 prisoners from death in concentration and prisoner camps; of these, 7,795 were Scandinavian. In particular, 423 Danish Jews were saved from the Theresienstadt concentration camp inside German-occupied territory of Czechoslovakia, contributing significantly to the fact that the casualties among Danish Jews during the Holocaust were among the lowest of the occupied countries of Europe.

In February 1945, Folke Bernadotte came to Berlin to meet German leaders, including Himmler. This initiative was intended to rescue the Scandinavian prisoners, and Bernadotte also met with the circle from Gross Kreutz. Hjort and Vogt-Svendsen had made sketches of the camps and a note on how the collection of the prisoners in Neuengamme could be done in practical terms, and Bernadotte used this as a basis for his action.

By the end of April, most of the Norwegian prisoners had been transported home, but Johan Bernhard Hjort and his son Helge remained at Gross Kreutz. They would not leave Germany until the last Norwegian prisoners were out. There were still 1,100 Norwegian officers left; Hjort had already met them in February and promised General Ruge to act as liaison until the prisoners could be sent home. The Hjort family&#x27;s overview of the Norwegian prisoners was the basis for the repatriation office in Hamburg (under the leadership of Bulukin) to pick up General Ruge and other Norwegian officers from Luckenwalde around 12 May 1945. The Norwegian officers were transferred from Schildberg to Luckenwalde in February 1945. Luckenwalde was captured by Soviet forces in April 1945 and General Ruge was sent to Moscow.

== Liberation and purge ==
Soviet forces reached Gross Kreutz at the end of April or beginning of May. The German farm manager was beaten to death by the Eastern European forced laborers on the estate. After Germany&#x27;s capitulation, the Soviet forces decided that the Norwegian officers should be sent home via Murmansk, but Hjort and other Norwegians found the prisoners and ensured that they were sent directly home to Norway. In early June, Hjort himself was back in Norway after almost three years in Germany.

The return home was hardly exactly what Johan Bernhard Hjort had imagined. The period after liberation proved to be difficult for him. Despite his great efforts on behalf of Norwegian prisoners, his own imprisonment and his defiant article in the Norwegian Legal Gazette, many people were still skeptical about other aspects of his past. Hjort&#x27;s actions up until 25 September 1940 could be interpreted as an attempt to find a third way, between Quisling&#x27;s treason and the London government&#x27;s resistance to the German occupiers. The mood after the liberation was not sympathetic, and several of his supporters from 1940 were convicted in the treason trial. Hjort vigorously defended himself against accusations of a lack of &quot;national attitude&quot;. He wrote about the articles from 1940 that they had to be seen in the light of the special situation.

Because of his past in the NS and his connection to the administrative council, he had to withdraw from a proposed position in the bar association. Hjort&#x27;s friend Gustav Heiberg was appointed chairman of the &quot;Commission of Inquiry of 1945&quot; (), and Hjort asked Heiberg for a statement in his favor. Heiberg first acknowledged Hjort&#x27;s work for the resistance, but then wrote about the election in the lawyers&#x27; association:

&quot;As far as you are concerned, it would be enough for me not to vote for you that you had been a member of NS as late as 1937 and that you had still been so German-oriented (by which I do not mean odious) in the early days of the war as your statements in Tidens Tegn indicated.&quot; ()

Johan Bernhard Hjort was not convicted, but on the contrary was given full redress by the Lawyers&#x27; Association. But something remained: His actions before the war and in 1940. As late as 1954, he spoke out in Verdens Gang, where he wrote about his past in NS: &quot;Is it not written somewhere that there should be greater joy over one sinner who repents than over many who never had the need for repentance?&quot;. In his view of the settlement, Hjort was in line with Johannes Andenæs and the newspaper Morgenbladet in what became known as the &quot;silk front&quot;. 

==Post-war career==

After the war, Hjort fought as a supreme court lawyer for the artistic freedom of controversial artists and for the natural legal rights of homosexuals. In 1957, in one of the most famous and widely debated court cases in Norwegian post-war history, Hjort was the defense lawyer for novelist Agnar Mykle, who was accused of immoral and obscene writing in his books. Hjort was a long-term leader of Riksmålsforbundet, an association that fought for the free evolution of the Norwegian language, in the direction of Riksmål. He was a prolific writer and lecturer and a frequent contributor to public debate. Among his books are &quot;Justismord&quot; (1952), &quot;Dømt med rette?&quot; (1958), and &quot;Demokrati og statsmakt&quot; (1963). He also translated Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot; into Norwegian.

<doc id="380175" wikidata="Q33785" url="?curid=380175" title="Achilles' heel">
<text>An Achilles&#x27; heel (or Achilles heel) is a weakness despite overall strength, which can lead to downfall. While the mythological origin refers to a physical vulnerability, idiomatic references to other attributes or qualities that can lead to downfall are common.

== The classical myth ==
Although the death of Achilles was predicted by Hector in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, it does not actually occur in the &quot;Iliad,&quot; but was described in later Greek and Roman poetry and drama concerning events after the &quot;Iliad&quot;, later in the Trojan War. In the myths surrounding the war, Achilles was said to have died from a wound to his heel, ankle, or torso, which was the result of an arrow—possibly poisoned—shot by Paris. The &quot;Iliad&quot; may purposefully suppress the myth to emphasise Achilles&#x27; human mortality and the stark chasm between gods and heroes.

Some later Hellenistic-era myths record Thetis trying to make her son immortal by anointing him with ambrosia and burning away his mortality in the hearth fire, but Peleus, his father, discovered the treatment and was alarmed to see Thetis holding the baby in the flames, which disrupted the ritual and thus made Thetis leave the treatment incomplete. According to a myth arising later, his mother had dipped the infant Achilles in the river Styx, holding onto him by his heel, and he became invulnerable where the waters touched him—that is, everywhere except the areas of his heel that were covered by her thumb and forefinger.

==As expression==
As an expression meaning &quot;area of weakness, vulnerable spot&quot;, the use of &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot; dates only to 1840, with implied use in Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Ireland, that vulnerable heel of the British Achilles!&quot; from 1810 (&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;).

==Anatomy==
The large and prominent tendon of the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles of the calf is called the &quot;tendo achilleus&quot; or Achilles tendon. This is commonly associated with the site of Achilles&#x27;s death wound. The oldest-known written record of the name is in 1693 by the Flemish/Dutch anatomist Philip Verheyen. In his widely used text &quot;Corporis Humani Anatomia&quot; he described the tendon&#x27;s location and said that it was commonly called &quot;the cord of Achilles&quot;. Tendons are avascular, so such an injury would be unlikely to be fatal if the arrow were not poisoned.

<text>Load testing is the process of putting demand on a structure or system and measuring its response.

== Software load testing ==
==Physical load testing==

Many types of machinery, engines, structures, and motors are load tested. The load may be at a designated safe working load (SWL), full load, or at an aggravated level of load. The governing contract, technical specification or test method contains the details of conducting the test. The purpose of a mechanical load test is to verify that all the component parts of a structure including materials, base-fixings are fit for task and loading it is designed for.

Several types of load testing are employed 
* Static testing is when a designated constant load is applied for a specified time. 
* Dynamic testing is when a variable or moving load is applied. 
* Cyclical testing consists of repeated loading and unloading for specified cycles, durations and conditions.

The &quot;Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulation 1992 UK&quot; state that load testing is undertaken before the equipment is put into service for the first time. Performance testing applies a safe working load (SWL), or other specified load, for a designated time in a governing test method, specification, or contract. Under the &quot;Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 UK&quot; load testing after the initial test is required if a major component is replaced, if the item is moved from one location to another or as dictated by the competent person.

==Car charging system==

A load test can be used to evaluate the health of a car&#x27;s battery. The tester consists of a large resistor that has a resistance similar to a car&#x27;s starter motor and a meter to read the battery&#x27;s output voltage both in the unloaded and loaded state. When the tester is used, the battery&#x27;s open circuit voltage is checked first. If the open circuit voltage is below spec (12.6 volts for a fully charged battery), the battery is charged first. After reading the battery&#x27;s open circuit voltage, the load is applied. When applied, it draws approximately the same current the car&#x27;s starter motor would draw during cranking. Based on the specified cold cranking amperes of the battery, if the voltage under load falls below a certain point, the battery is bad. Load tests are also used on running cars to check the output of the car&#x27;s alternator.

<text>Student Pugwash USA is the U.S. affiliate of International Student/Young Pugwash, and the US student affiliate of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, recipients of the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize.

As an educational nonprofit organization, SPUSA does not adopt advocacy positions on policy or political issues or candidates, but seeks to foment student leadership and incubate groups of committed activists who go on to take action separate from SPUSA activities. The organization posits that, in order to create effective social change, students must first understand the issues at stake, then contemplate their ethical and moral responsibility to themselves and to society as a whole. Its stated purpose is not to advance a particular ethical viewpoint regarding scientific and technological issues, but rather to encourage students to consider ethics when thinking about the role of science and technology in society. SPUSA is open to all viewpoints and approaches to these discussions, but with a firm commitment to accurate science and factual information. For example, early SPUSA panel debates were held regarding the causes of climate change, before there was consensus in the scientific community; afterwards, that debate was considered resolved and no longer appropriate, but events continue discussing which approaches to take in response to current information.

==Activities==
Activities have included regional, national and international conferences, speaker events at campuses through a national chapter network, and compilation of issue briefs on scientific and technical issues of social importance.

<doc id="380191" wikidata="Q1099545" url="?curid=380191" title="Janko group">
<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Janko groups are the four sporadic simple groups &quot;J1&quot;, &quot;J2&quot;, &quot;J3&quot; and &quot;J4&quot; introduced by Zvonimir Janko. Unlike the Mathieu groups, Conway groups, or Fischer groups, the Janko groups do not form a series, and the relation among the four groups is mainly historical rather than mathematical.

== History ==
Janko constructed the first of these groups, &quot;J&quot;1, in 1965 and predicted the existence of &quot;J&quot;2 and &quot;J&quot;3. In 1976, he suggested the existence of &quot;J&quot;4. Later, &quot;J&quot;2, &quot;J&quot;3 and &quot;J&quot;4 were all shown to exist.

&quot;J&quot;1 was the first sporadic simple group discovered in nearly a century: until then only the Mathieu groups were known, &quot;M&quot;11 and &quot;M&quot;12 having been found in 1861, and &quot;M&quot;22, &quot;M&quot;23 and &quot;M&quot;24 in 1873. The discovery of &quot;J&quot;1 caused a great &quot;sensation&quot; and &quot;surprise&quot; among group theory specialists. This began the modern theory of sporadic groups.

And in a sense, &quot;J&quot;4 ended it. It would be the last sporadic group (and, since the non-sporadic families had already been found, the last finite simple group) predicted and discovered, though this could only be said in hindsight when the Classification theorem was completed.

<text>Ivo of Chartres, Can.Reg. (also Ives, Yves, or Yvo; ; 1040 – 23 December 1115), was a French canon regular and abbot who then served as the Bishop of Chartres from 1090 until his death. He was an important authority in Catholic canon law during the Investiture Crisis of that era. He is honored as a saint in the Catholic Church.

Three extensive canonical works, namely &quot;Tripartita&quot;, &quot;Decretum&quot;, and &quot;Panormia&quot;, are attributed to him. He corresponded extensively. His liturgical feast is observed on 23 December.

==Life==
===Early life===
Ivo was born in or near Chartres circa 1040 to a family of relatively low social status. He is claimed to have studied first in Paris, then at the Abbey of Bec in Normandy, where, according to Robert of Torigni, he studied under Lanfranc along with Anselm of Canterbury.

Not much is known of Ivo until some time after he was admitted to the clergy. His first benefice was at Nesle in Picardy. In 1067 his bishop, Gui of Beauvais, asked him to become the provost (termed abbot) of the Collegiate Church of Saint-Quentin. Under his leadership and program of reform, the community of secular canons established there accepted religious life under the Rule of St. Augustine, thereby becoming canons regular. As superior, he was skeptical of religious excess and always stressed moderation in practice.

Ivo remained at the abbey for twenty years and established himself as one of the best teachers in France. His abbey came to be known as a great school of theology. Lambert of Guines and John of Warneton both studied canon law under Ivo.

===Bishop===
In 1090 Ivo&#x27;s knowledge of canon law, both as a lawyer and cleric, most probably earned him the office of Bishop of Chartres. His predecessor, Geoffrey, had been removed from office by Pope Urban II. Geoffrey&#x27;s relatives and supporters initially opposed Ivo&#x27;s appointment, but with the backing of Pope Urban II, King Philip, and the influential Countess Adela of Blois, Ivo was eventually grudgingly accepted. In light of the events preceding his appointment to the office, his strong opposition to the practice of simony may have been the impetus to his episcopal elevation.

During his twenty-five year episcopacy at Chartres, Ivo was involved in conflicts with many magnates including King Philip I of France, Archbishop Richer of Sens, the papal legate Hugh of Die, and several local nobles. The most famous case concerned the marriage of King Philip, who in the early 1090s tried to repudiate his wife Bertha of Holland in order to marry Bertrade of Anjou. Local baron Hugh Le Puiset took advantage of the situation to seize episcopal lands and imprison the bishop for a short time.

Ivo was an acquaintance of Countess Adele of Normandy, who helped him reform the Abbey of St. Jean-en-Vallée. In addition, on several occasions he defended her decisions, most notably during the events regarding Rotrou III of Perche, when he refused to assert ecclesiastical sanctions against him.

Around 1114, Ivo granted to Bernard of Abbeville land in Thiron-Gardais, where Bernard established the monastery that would become the Abbey of the Holy Trinity of Tiron.

During his episcopacy Ivo wrote the majority of his extant works, for which he later became famous and considered among the greatest scholars of the mediaeval era.

==Works==

Ivo was a prolific writer but is most known for his canonical works: the &quot;Decretum&quot; of seventeen books; the &quot;Tripartita&quot;, of very substantial material, divided in three parts, and attributed to him; and the &quot;Panormia&quot; of eight books attributed to him. All three are primarily works of canon law. The Prologue to the &quot;Decretum&quot; deals with the interpretation of canon law, and specifically argues that &quot;caritas&quot; was the solution for sin, and not harsh punishment without contrition. &quot;He was called to teach. His lesson was love. It was all that mattered.&quot;

Ivo is also famous for his 288 letters of correspondence. These letters often dealt with liturgical, canonical, and dogmatic questions and, much like his major works, are from the perspective of &quot;caritas&quot;. Several of his extant sermons, totaling 25, treat of the same topics as his other writings and letters.

It has also been suggested that his doctrines influenced the final agreement of the Concordat of Worms in 1122.

==Subsequent influence and veneration==

Ivo&#x27;s writings had considerable influence in the twelfth century and beyond. Many of his letters and sermons circulated already in his lifetime, and were copied widely especially in the mid-twelfth century. The same is true for the canonical collections attributed to him; they were copied frequently and used in the making of other collections. For example, Gratian’s &quot;Concordia Discordantium Canonum&quot; (commonly denominated &quot;Decretum Gratiani&quot;) draws on both the Tripartita and the Panormia. Alger of Liège was strongly influenced by Ivo&#x27;s Prologus and quoted from his Decretum. Peter Abelard in his &quot;Sic et Non&quot; used the Prologue, too, and apparently quoted both from Ivo&#x27;s Decretum and from the Panormia.

Although it is not known when he was canonized, 23 December is his present liturgical memorial. Before 1570 it was observed on 20 May.

The parish of Maintenon is under his patronage as the .

<text>The 1987 Rugby World Cup was the first Rugby World Cup. It was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia – New Zealand hosted 21 matches (17 pool stage matches, two semi-finals, the third-place play-off and the final) while Australia hosted 11 matches (seven pool matches, two quarter-finals and both semi-finals). The tournament was won by New Zealand, who were the strong favourites and won all their matches comfortably. New Zealand defeated France 29–9 in the final at Eden Park in Auckland. The New Zealand team was captained by David Kirk and included such rugby greats as Sean Fitzpatrick, John Kirwan, Grant Fox and Michael Jones. Wales finished third, and Australia fourth, after conceding crucial tries in the dying seconds of both their semi-final against France and the third-place play-off against Wales.

Seven of the sixteen participating teams were the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) members – New Zealand, Australia, England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and France. South Africa was unable to compete because of the international sporting boycott due to apartheid. Invitations were given to Argentina, Fiji, Italy, Canada, Romania, Tonga, Japan, Zimbabwe and the United States. This left Western Samoa controversially excluded, despite their better playing standard than some of the teams invited. The USSR were to be invited but they declined the invitation on political grounds, allegedly due to the continued IRFB membership of South Africa. There was no qualification process for the tournament.

The tournament witnessed a number of one-sided matches, with the seven IRFB members proving too strong for the other teams. Half of the 24 matches across the four pools saw one team score 40 or more points. The tournament was seen as a major success and proved that the event was viable in the long term.

==Participating nations==
The tournament comprised the seven members of the IRFB, and nine teams invited by the IRFB; there was no qualification process for teams.
*South Africa was excluded due to its pro-apartheid policies.

==Pools and format==

*Pool 1 was played in Australia
*Pool 2 was played with five matches held in New Zealand and one in Australia
*Pool 3 was played in New Zealand
*Pool 4 was played in New Zealand

The inaugural World Cup was contested by 16 nations. There was no qualifying tournament to determine the participants; instead, the 16 nations were invited by the International Rugby Football Board to compete. The simple 16-team pool/knock-out format was used with the teams divided into four pools of four, with each team playing the others in their pool once, for a total of three matches per team in the pool stage. Nations were awarded two points for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss: teams finishing level on points were separated by tries scored, rather than total points difference (had it been otherwise, Argentina would have taken second place in Group C ahead of Fiji, although France would still have won Group D.) The top two nations of every pool advanced to the quarter-finals. The runners-up of each pool faced the winners of a different pool in the quarter-finals. A standard single-elimination tournament followed, with the losers of the semi-finals contesting an additional play-off match to determine third place.

A total of 32 matches (24 in the pool stage and eight in the knock-out stage) were played in the tournament over 29 days from 22 May to 20 June 1987.

<text>In group theory, a topic in abstract algebra, the Mathieu groups are the five sporadic simple groups &quot;M&quot;11, &quot;M&quot;12, &quot;M&quot;22, &quot;M&quot;23 and &quot;M&quot;24 introduced by . They are multiply transitive permutation groups on 11, 12, 22, 23 or 24 objects. They are the first sporadic groups to be discovered.

Sometimes the notation &quot;M&quot;8, &quot;M&quot;9, &quot;M&quot;10, &quot;M&quot;20, and &quot;M&quot;21 is used for related groups (which act on sets of 8, 9, 10, 20, and 21 points, respectively), namely the stabilizers of points in the larger groups. While these are not sporadic simple groups, they are subgroups of the larger groups and can be used to construct the larger ones. John Conway has shown that one can also extend this sequence up, obtaining the Mathieu groupoid &quot;M&quot;13 acting on 13 points. &quot;M&quot;21 is simple, but is not a sporadic group, being isomorphic to PSL(3,4).

== History ==

 introduced the group &quot;M&quot;12 as part of an investigation of multiply transitive permutation groups, and briefly mentioned (on page 274) the group &quot;M&quot;24, giving its order. In he gave further details, including explicit generating sets for his groups, but it was not easy to see from his arguments that the groups generated are not just alternating groups, and for several years the existence of his groups was controversial. even published a paper mistakenly claiming to prove that &quot;M&quot;24 does not exist, though shortly afterwards in he pointed out that his proof was wrong, and gave a proof that the Mathieu groups are simple. finally removed the doubts about the existence of these groups, by constructing them as successive transitive extensions of permutation groups, as well as automorphism groups of Steiner systems.

After the Mathieu groups, no new sporadic groups were found until 1965, when the group J1 was discovered.

== Multiply transitive groups ==

Mathieu was interested in finding multiply transitive permutation groups, which will now be defined. For a natural number &quot;k&quot;, a permutation group &quot;G&quot; acting on &quot;n&quot; points is &quot;k&quot;-transitive if, given two sets of points &quot;a&quot;1, ... &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; and &quot;b&quot;1, ... &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; with the property that all the &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; are distinct and all the &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; are distinct, there is a group element &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; which maps &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; to &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; for each &quot;i&quot; between 1 and &quot;k&quot;. Such a group is called sharply &quot;k&quot;-transitive if the element &quot;g&quot; is unique (i.e. the action on &quot;k&quot;-tuples is regular, rather than just transitive).

&quot;M&quot;24 is 5-transitive, and &quot;M&quot;12 is sharply 5-transitive, with the other Mathieu groups (simple or not) being the subgroups corresponding to stabilizers of &quot;m&quot; points, and accordingly of lower transitivity (&quot;M&quot;23 is 4-transitive, etc.). These are the only two 5-transitive groups that are neither symmetric groups nor alternating groups .

The only 4-transitive groups are the symmetric groups &quot;S&quot;&quot;k&quot; for &quot;k&quot; at least 4, the alternating groups &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot; for &quot;k&quot; at least 6, and the Mathieu groups &quot;M&quot;24, &quot;M&quot;23, &quot;M&quot;12, and &quot;M&quot;11. The full proof requires the classification of finite simple groups, but some special cases have been known for much longer.

It is a classical result of Jordan that the symmetric and alternating groups (of degree &quot;k&quot; and &quot;k&quot; + 2 respectively), and &quot;M&quot;12 and &quot;M&quot;11 are the only &quot;sharply&quot; &quot;k&quot;-transitive permutation groups for &quot;k&quot; at least 4.

Important examples of multiply transitive groups are the 2-transitive groups and the Zassenhaus groups. The Zassenhaus groups notably include the projective general linear group of a projective line over a finite field, PGL(2,F&quot;q&quot;), which is sharply 3-transitive (see cross ratio) on formula_1 elements.

=== Order and transitivity table ===
== Constructions of the Mathieu groups ==

The Mathieu groups can be constructed in various ways.

===Permutation groups===

&quot;M&quot;12 has a simple subgroup of order 660, a maximal subgroup. That subgroup is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL2(F11) over the field of 11 elements. With −1 written as a and infinity as b, two standard generators are (0123456789a) and (0b)(1a)(25)(37)(48)(69). A third generator giving &quot;M&quot;12 sends an element &quot;x&quot; of F11 to 4&quot;x&quot;2 − 3&quot;x&quot;7; as a permutation that is (26a7)(3945).

This group turns out not to be isomorphic to any member of the infinite families of finite simple groups and is called sporadic. &quot;M&quot;11 is the stabilizer of a point in &quot;M&quot;12, and turns out also to be a sporadic simple group. &quot;M&quot;10, the stabilizer of two points, is not sporadic, but is an almost simple group whose commutator subgroup is the alternating group A6. It is thus related to the exceptional outer automorphism of A6. The stabilizer of 3 points is the projective special unitary group PSU(3,22), which is solvable. The stabilizer of 4 points is the quaternion group.

Likewise, &quot;M&quot;24 has a maximal simple subgroup of order 6072 isomorphic to PSL2(F23). One generator adds 1 to each element of the field (leaving the point &quot;N&quot; at infinity fixed), i.e. (0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLM)(&quot;N&quot;), and the other sends &quot;x&quot; to −1/&quot;x&quot;, i.e. (0N)(1M)(2B)(3F)(4H)(59)(6J)(7D)(8K)(AG)(CL)(EI). A third generator giving &quot;M&quot;24 sends an element &quot;x&quot; of F23 to 4&quot;x&quot;4 − 3&quot;x&quot;15 (which sends perfect squares via &quot;x&quot;4 and non-perfect squares via 7&quot;x&quot;4); computation shows that as a permutation this is (2G968)(3CDI4)(7HABM)(EJLKF).

The stabilizers of 1 and 2 points, &quot;M&quot;23 and &quot;M&quot;22, also turn out to be sporadic simple groups. The stabilizer of 3 points is simple and isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL3(4).

These constructions were cited by . ascribe the permutations to Mathieu.

=== Automorphism groups of Steiner systems ===

There exists up to equivalence a unique &quot;S&quot;(5,8,24) Steiner system W24 (the Witt design). The group &quot;M&quot;24 is the automorphism group of this Steiner system; that is, the set of permutations which map every block to some other block. The subgroups &quot;M&quot;23 and &quot;M&quot;22 are defined to be the stabilizers of a single point and two points respectively.

Similarly, there exists up to equivalence a unique &quot;S&quot;(5,6,12) Steiner system W12, and the group &quot;M&quot;12 is its automorphism group. The subgroup &quot;M&quot;11 is the stabilizer of a point.

&quot;W&quot;12 can be constructed from the affine geometry on the vector space , an &quot;S&quot;(2,3,9) system.

An alternative construction of &quot;W&quot;12 is the &quot;Kitten&quot; of .

An introduction to a construction of &quot;W&quot;24 via the Miracle Octad Generator of R. T. Curtis and Conway&#x27;s analog for &quot;W&quot;12, the miniMOG, can be found in the book by Conway and Sloane.

=== Automorphism groups on the Golay code ===
The group &quot;M&quot;24 is the permutation automorphism group of the extended binary Golay code &quot;W&quot;, i.e., the group of permutations on the 24 coordinates that map &quot;W&quot; to itself. All the Mathieu groups can be constructed as groups of permutations on the binary Golay code.

&quot;M&quot;12 has index 2 in its automorphism group, and &quot;M&quot;12:2 happens to be isomorphic to a subgroup of &quot;M&quot;24. &quot;M&quot;12 is the stabilizer of a dodecad, a codeword of 12 1&#x27;s; &quot;M&quot;12:2 stabilizes a partition into 2 complementary dodecads.

There is a natural connection between the Mathieu groups and the larger Conway groups, because the Leech lattice was constructed on the binary Golay code and in fact both lie in spaces of dimension 24. The Conway groups in turn are found in the Monster group. Robert Griess refers to the 20 sporadic groups found in the Monster as the Happy Family, and to the Mathieu groups as the first generation.

===Dessins d&#x27;enfants===

The Mathieu groups can be constructed via dessins d&#x27;enfants, with the dessin associated to &quot;M&quot;12 suggestively called &quot;Monsieur Mathieu&quot; by .

<doc id="380210" wikidata="Q963185" url="?curid=380210" title="Donovan McNabb">
<text>Donovan Jamal McNabb (born November 25, 1976) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons, primarily with the Philadelphia Eagles. He played college football for the Syracuse Orange and was selected with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft by the Eagles, where he spent 11 seasons. McNabb also spent a year each with the Washington Redskins and Minnesota Vikings. The Eagles retired McNabb&#x27;s no. 5 jersey when he was inducted to the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame in 2013.

As the Eagles&#x27; starting quarterback from 1999 to 2009, McNabb led the team to eight playoff appearances (including five consecutive from 2000 to 2004), five division titles and appearances in the NFC Championship Game (including four consecutive from 2001 to 2004), nine postseason wins, and one Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXIX.

McNabb is widely regarded as one of the most successful quarterbacks in Philadelphia Eagles history, despite not having won a Super Bowl. McNabb&#x27;s awards and honors include being named to six Pro Bowls, being named twice as CBS Radio&#x27;s NFC Player of Year (2000, 2004), and named as the 101 Awards NFC Offensive Player of the Year (2004). He is known for his dual-threat skills as a quarterback, being only the fourth quarterback to amass over 30,000 passing yards, 200 touchdown passes, 3,000 rushing yards, and 20 rushing touchdowns in the regular season, and only the third quarterback with over 3,000 passing yards, 400 rushing yards, and 25 total touchdowns in the postseason. McNabb led the NFL twice in total offense per game (2005, 2006), led the NFL in total touchdowns per game (2002), and in 2008 held the NFL record for lowest career interception percentage (2.09%, now surpassed). He is the Eagles&#x27; franchise leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns, attempts, and completions.

==Early life==
McNabb was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. He attended Mount Carmel High School, where as a sophomore, he was a teammate of future NFL players Simeon Rice and Matt Cushing. Together, they helped Mount Carmel win the 1991 State Championship over Wheaton Central High School. In 1993, as a senior, he led the team to a Chicago Prep Bowl championship. He also excelled at track and field, and played basketball with Antoine Walker.

==College career==
Though McNabb was approached by recruiters from numerous colleges, only two schools, Syracuse University and the University of Nebraska, offered him scholarships to play college football as a quarterback. He initially leaned toward attending Nebraska, as he relished the idea of being coached by Tom Osborne. Eventually, however, he decided to attend Syracuse and play for the Syracuse Orange football team, principally because he wanted to prove he was a competent &quot;pocket passer&quot;, but also for their broadcast journalism program.

After redshirting in 1994, his first year at Syracuse, McNabb went on to start every game during his college career, compiling a 35–14 record. As a freshman, he completed the longest touchdown pass in Syracuse&#x27;s history—a 96-yard throw against West Virginia University—in a game where he accounted for 354 total yards of offense; he was named the Big East Conference&#x27;s rookie of the year at the end of the season. McNabb amassed 2,892 yards of total offense in his junior season to set a school record. As a senior, he led Syracuse to a berth in the Orange Bowl against Florida, as he completed 157 of 251 passes (62.5%) for 2,134 yards; he also pushed the eventual champions, the Tennessee Volunteers, to the limit in a very close game. His 22 touchdown passes tied the school&#x27;s single-season record, set by former Eagle Don McPherson in 1987. McNabb also rushed 135 times for 438 yards and eight touchdowns. He ranked sixth in the nation with a 158.9 passing efficiency rating and 22nd in total offense, with 233.8 yards per game. He tied a school record with four touchdown passes against Cincinnati, and scored five touchdowns against Miami (three rushing and two passing). McNabb was also teammates with future NFL star Marvin Harrison for one season at Syracuse.

McNabb was named the Big East&#x27;s offensive player of the decade for the 1990s, and Big East Offensive Player of the Year three times from 1996 to 1998, as well as the first-team all-conference vote earner in each of his four seasons. He was a finalist for the 1998 Heisman Trophy. Later, he was named to the Syracuse All-Century football team.

McNabb was also a walk-on for two seasons for the Syracuse basketball team under head coach Jim Boeheim. He spent two years as a reserve on the school&#x27;s nationally ranked basketball team, including the 1996 squad that lost to Kentucky (a team led by his former high-school teammate Antoine Walker) in the National Championship game.

During his junior year, McNabb hosted Michael Vick when Vick visited Syracuse during a recruiting visit, and the two remained friends afterward.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Eagles===
====1999====
McNabb was drafted in the first round as the second overall pick by the Eagles, behind first pick Tim Couch, in the 1999 NFL draft. A group of Eagles fans known as the &quot;Dirty 30&quot; were sent to the draft by sports radio host Angelo Cataldi and Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell. The two believed the Eagles would select running back Ricky Williams and they wanted the fans to cheer the selection. However, when the Eagles selected McNabb the &quot;Dirty 30&quot; ended up loudly booing McNabb when he appeared on stage. McNabb was the second of five quarterbacks selected in the first 12 picks of a quarterback-rich class that was at that point considered the best quarterback draft since the famous class of 1983. However, only McNabb and Daunte Culpepper went on to have successful careers in the NFL; Tim Couch struggled with the Cleveland Browns and officially retired in 2007 after being cut by the Jacksonville Jaguars in a failed comeback bid, while Akili Smith and Cade McNown were out of the NFL by 2002. By 2006, only McNabb was still with the team that originally drafted him.

McNabb saw his first NFL regular-season action in the second half against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a 19–5 home loss on September 19. He made his first career start at home against Washington on November 14, completing eight of 21 passes for 60 yards in a 35–28 win. He also had nine carries for 49 rushing yards and led the team to a pair of successful two-point conversions (one rush and one pass). He was the first Eagles rookie to start at quarterback since Brad Goebel, and the first Eagles rookie draft pick to start since John Reaves in 1972. With the win, McNabb became the first Eagles rookie quarterback to win his first NFL start since Mike Boryla (December 1, 1974, against Green Bay) and the first Eagle quarterback to win his first start since Ty Detmer (October 13, 1996, against the New York Giants).

McNabb threw the first touchdown pass of his career (six yards to tight end Chad Lewis) against the Indianapolis Colts in a 44–17 home loss on November 21, 1999. McNabb went on to start six of the Eagles&#x27; final seven contests (missing the December 19 home game against the New England Patriots, a 24–9 victory, due to injury).

====2000–2003: NFC East championship runs====
In his first full season as an NFL starter in 2000, McNabb finished second in the Associated Press MVP voting (24–11) to St. Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk, who set the NFL record for most touchdowns scored in a season. McNabb made his primetime debut on ESPN against the Atlanta Falcons at home on October 1, with his first 300-yard passing game in a 38–10 victory and the Eagles&#x27; first 300-yard passer since Bobby Hoying against the Cincinnati Bengals at home on November 30, 1997. McNabb&#x27;s 55 pass attempts at Pittsburgh in a come-from-behind 26–23 overtime victory on November 12 were then a career high and tied for the fourth-highest total in team history. He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week after accounting for 90.7% of the offense in a 23–20 victory at Washington on November 26. His 125 rushing yards were the most by an NFL quarterback since the Chicago Bears&#x27; Bobby Douglass rushed for 127 on December 17, 1972, and was the eighth-best rushing effort by a quarterback since 1940 when the T formation was introduced. He threw a career-high 390 passing yards and four touchdowns in a 35–24 victory at the Cleveland Browns on December 10 en route to his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week award. McNabb led the Eagles to their first playoff appearance since 1996, where they defeated the favored Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21–3 in the Wild Card Round before losing to the New York Giants 20–10 in the Divisional Round.

McNabb was selected as a first alternate to the NFC Pro Bowl squad in 2000 (behind Daunte Culpepper, Jeff Garcia, and Kurt Warner). When Warner was unable to participate due to injury, McNabb took his spot. He accounted for 74.6% of the team&#x27;s total net yards in 2000, third highest in the NFL. Only Carolina&#x27;s Steve Beuerlein (75.3%) and San Francisco&#x27;s Garcia (75.1%) had a higher percentage. His 629 rushing yards in 2000 led the Eagles, made McNabb only the third quarterback since 1970 to lead his team in rushing, and at the time was the fourth-highest season rushing total by a quarterback (968 by Bobby Douglass in 1972, 942 by Randall Cunningham in 1990, and 674 by Steve McNair in 1997). His six rushing touchdowns in 2000 were the most by an Eagles quarterback since Randall Cunningham, who also had six in 1988. McNabb broke the club&#x27;s single-season record for most attempts (569) and completions (330) in 2000, marks previously set by Cunningham (560 and 301, respectively) in 1988. He was named 2000 NFC Player of the Year by CBS Radio and the Terry Bradshaw Awards on Fox Sports and was named to the All-Madden team.

In 2001, McNabb led the Eagles to an 11–5 season and fourth-quarter comebacks in two wins against the defending NFC champion New York Giants. At the Meadowlands on October 22, his 18-yard pass to James Thrash with 1:52 remaining gave the Eagles a 10–9 victory, and their first win over the Giants in ten games. He also wiped out a 21–14 deficit on December 30, engineering two fourth-quarter scores as the Eagles clinched their first NFC East title in thirteen years with a 24–21 win. In NFC Divisional Round against the Chicago Bears on January 19, 2002, he was 26-of-40 for 262 yards and two touchdowns passing and adding 37 yards and a touchdown on the ground, which was also the final touchdown at the old Soldier Field. He became only the fourth quarterback in Eagles history to pass for 3,000 yards in consecutive seasons – Sonny Jurgensen (1961–62), Ron Jaworski (1980–81), and Randall Cunningham (1988–90) were the others. McNabb&#x27;s Eagles advanced to the NFC Championship for the first time since 1980, losing to the heavily favored St. Louis Rams.

McNabb earned his second trip to the Pro Bowl (was originally elected as an alternate) following the 2001 season after combining for 3,715 yards of total offense and establishing career highs in touchdown passes (25) and quarterback rating (84.3). Including the playoffs, he threw touchdown passes in 15 of 18 games and two-or-more in 12 of those games. He was named by his teammates as the club&#x27;s offensive MVP in 2000 and 2001. During the off-season, McNabb signed a new contract with the Eagles worth $115 million over 12 years, with a $20.5 million signing bonus.

In 2002, McNabb was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for September, his first time receiving that award. During that month, McNabb led the Eagles to a franchise-record 140 points through four games. In that span, he accounted for 71.5 percent of the club&#x27;s offensive production, and completed 92 of 150 passes for 1,050 yards and nine touchdowns with three interceptions for a 92.2 passer rating. He also rushed for 141 yards and two touchdowns. In week 11 of the 2002 season, McNabb suffered a broken fibula. On the third play of the game against the Arizona Cardinals, he was sacked by the Cardinals&#x27; Adrian Wilson and LeVar Woods. He fumbled the ball, fell to the ground, and held his right leg. He went to the locker room to have his ankle taped, but returned for the Eagles&#x27; second drive. McNabb ended the game 20-of-25 passing with 255 yards and four touchdowns, putting him as the NFL&#x27;s leader in total touchdowns per game where he remained for the rest of the season. McNabb&#x27;s injury was initially reported to be a sprained ankle, however X-rays after the game revealed that McNabb&#x27;s fibula was broken, and he was out for the remainder of the regular season. A dominant defense helped A. J. Feeley and Koy Detmer go a combined 5–1 to finish the season. McNabb returned to face the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, but he recovered slowly. The Eagles defeated the Falcons 20–6, but were upset at home 27–10 by the eventual champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers and their top-ranked defense in the NFC Championship. The Buccaneers&#x27; pass defense was so dominant that McNabb&#x27;s passer rating in the game was poor (58.5), and other opposing quarterbacks fared even worse than McNabb (the respective passer ratings managed against the Buccaneers in the 2002 playoffs by Jeff Garcia and AP NFL MVP Rich Gannon were 35.9 and 48.9).

In late September 2003, McNabb was the subject of very controversial comments made by Rush Limbaugh, who worked as a commentator for ESPN at the time, stating that McNabb was overrated, and that, &quot;I think what we&#x27;ve had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well&quot;. The comments came after the Eagles began the season 0–2, losing to defending Super Bowl champion Buccaneers and eventual champion New England, both losses coming in their newly opened stadium, Lincoln Financial Field. Many responses from commentators, football players, coaches, and other public figures were sharply critical of Limbaugh. Within days ESPN issued a statement that the network communicated to Limbaugh his comments were insensitive and inappropriate, and Limbaugh resigned soon after. In 2005 the so-called &quot;Rush Limbaugh Hypothesis&quot; was tested by a review of more than 10,000 articles published in the 2002 NFL season, and offered no support to Limbaugh&#x27;s position. The long-term negative social implications of the remarks were revisited in 2021 after Limbaugh&#x27;s death from lung cancer.

Despite the slow beginning in the 2003 season, McNabb had the highest quarterback rating (97.5) in the NFL for the second half of the season and also completed over 62% of his passes for over eight yards per attempt. McNabb again led his team to the NFC Championship, highlighted by the Eagles&#x27; comeback overtime win against the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round. The NFL placed this game at #69 on its list of 100 greatest games in the first 100 years of NFL history. McNabb became the first quarterback to rush for more than 100 yards in a postseason game, surpassing the previous NFL record which Otto Graham held for over 50 years. He also completed the critical 4th and 26 pass to Freddie Mitchell during the game-tying drive at the end of regulation. Later analysis published in 2012 by Advanced Football Analytics and the &quot;Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports&quot; determined that the Eagles&#x27; odds of tying the score under those conditions was &quot;a whopping 1 out of 175.&quot; The 2003 NFC Championship ended in disappointment with Philadelphia&#x27;s 14–3 home loss to the underdog Carolina Panthers in the NFC Championship. McNabb was injured with separated rib cartilage in the second quarter, when a sack by Panthers&#x27; defensive end Mike Rucker was worsened by linebacker Greg Favors tackling McNabb on the ground, because Favors was unsure if the play was over. McNabb sat out for one play before returning to the game. McNabb attempted to play through the injury but was much less effective afterward, completing only four of his next 12 passes including three interceptions, leaving the game for Koy Detmer to play the fourth quarter.

With this defeat, McNabb joined Ken Stabler of the Oakland Raiders (1973–1975) and Danny White of the Dallas Cowboys (1980–1982) as the third quarterback to lead a team to defeats in conference title games for three consecutive seasons (including, in McNabb&#x27;s case, upset losses on the Eagles&#x27; home field in 2002 and 2003). The New York Post noted that McNabb&#x27;s cumulative passer rating in the three championship games was 50.5, which was a figure lower than the NFL&#x27;s lowest passer ratings during those seasons, and not an acceptable rating for a franchise quarterback drafted with the goal of leading the Eagles to their first championship in over 40 years. This prompted some observers to conclude that McNabb simply &quot;choked&quot; in big games, while other information suggested the reality was more complicated: in 2001, McNabb was in his second full season as a starter, the Eagles were not expected to appear in the NFC Championship game, and his performance in the Eagles’ loss to the heavily favored Rams was not considered choking; in 2002, the Buccaneers&#x27; Tampa 2 pass defense included four eventual Hall of Famers and McNabb&#x27;s 58.5 passer rating – though poor – was the highest against the Buccaneers in the 2002 playoffs including Super Bowl XXXVII (also worth noting: in the 1999 NFC Championship, league MVP Kurt Warner’s 56.2 passer rating against the Buccaneers was lower than McNabb&#x27;s in 2002, and the Rams’ top-ranked offense scored less points than the Eagles&#x27; offense did in 2002 - possibly avoiding the choking status because the Rams won, sustained by strong defense that held the Buccaneers to six points); in 2003, a second-quarter separated rib cartilage injury affected McNabb&#x27;s ability to throw until he was pulled from the game, and the team&#x27;s second-leading receiver and rusher Brian Westbrook missed the game due to a triceps injury; in all three NFC championship games, the Eagles’ only Pro Bowl-level receiving target was tight end Chad Lewis, and their starting wide receiver corps was arguably among the league&#x27;s least productive over that period.

====2004: Super Bowl XXXIX====
McNabb finally amassed the kind of numbers that placed him firmly as one of the elite NFL quarterbacks statistically. He averaged 8.26 yards per attempt, completed 64.0% of his passes, threw 31 touchdown passes (he also ran for three more), and had only eight interceptions. These numbers translated to a season passer rating of 104.7, which not only set an Eagles franchise record, but was also 2nd in the NFC for 2004, surpassed the season-leading passer ratings of the NFL&#x27;s most recent seasons at that time (2000–2003, and also 2005–2006), and tied Steve Young for the fifteenth-highest single season passer rating up to that point in NFL history. Further, he became the first quarterback in league history to throw over 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single season, and set a new NFL single season record with 20 completions over 40 yards. This dramatic improvement coincided with a massive upgrading of the Eagles&#x27; receiving corps, namely the arrival of Terrell Owens, who caught 77 passes for 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in only 14 games. Owens was the team&#x27;s first Pro Bowl-caliber wide receiver since before Coach Reid was hired (Irving Fryar, 1997) and the team&#x27;s first All-Pro wide receiver in almost 20 years (Mike Quick, 1985). As a result, the Eagles won their first seven games of the season for the first time in franchise history, clinched first place in their division with five weeks still to play in the regular season, and won the NFC East by a record-tying seven-game margin in posting a 13–3 record, the franchise&#x27;s best 16-game season ever. McNabb ended the season 1 TD short of tying the Eagles&#x27; single season records for passing TDs and total TDs, in large part because he only played sparingly in the team&#x27;s fifteenth game (attempting and completing three passes, with 1 TD), and the team rested McNabb for the season finale.

McNabb had arguably his most productive game of the season in a week-13 game against the Super Bowl-contending Green Bay Packers. After starting the game completing his first 14 passes (setting an NFL record with 24 consecutive passes completed over a two-game span), he led the Eagles to a 47–17 blowout victory. McNabb passed for an Eagles&#x27; then-record 464 yards and five touchdowns (all five in the first half), a 74.4% completion percentage, and a 147.8 passer rating. McNabb&#x27;s performance was only the second game in NFL history with a quarterback passing for more than 450 yards, 5 TDs, and no interceptions, the first being Y.A. Tittle in 1962.

In the playoffs, McNabb led the Eagles to their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, with victories over the Minnesota Vikings 27–14 in the Divisional Round and Atlanta Falcons 27–10 in the NFC Championship. McNabb completed 65.4% of his passes in the NFC championship for 180 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions, 32 yards rushing, and a passer rating of 111.1. Owens did not play during the two playoff victories as he was recovering from a severely sprained ankle and injured ligament that occurred during a game against the Cowboys in week 15. McNabb became only the third African-American quarterback to start in a Super Bowl after Doug Williams in 1987 and Steve McNair in 1999.

McNabb led the Eagles against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX. McNabb struggled at times as the Patriots&#x27; defense implemented a plan to stifle the Eagles&#x27; running attack and contain McNabb&#x27;s mobility. The Patriots&#x27; plan mostly succeeded, limiting the Eagles to only 45 yards rushing for the game and zero rushing yards for McNabb. Almost half of those yards were gained on a 22-yard run by Brian Westbrook as time expired at the end of the first half, and the Eagles ballcarriers averaged less than 1.5 yards per rush (23 yards on 16 carries) during the rest of the game. The Eagles&#x27; receiving corps was also depleted, as tight end Chad Lewis missed the game due to injury, and wide receiver Todd Pinkston was forced to leave the game due to dehydration after leading the Eagles&#x27; receivers in the first half with four receptions for 82 yards. The Patriots sacked McNabb four times, and McNabb threw three crucial interceptions (two of which were in New England territory, and one of those was inside the 20-yard line). The last was intercepted off a deflected pass thrown by McNabb from the Eagles’ own end zone with just 12 seconds remaining in the game. Some controversy followed the game, with rumors circulating that McNabb became ill and threw up in the huddle during the Eagles&#x27; last touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter. McNabb denied the rumor and accepted blame for the defeat. The rumor persisted even though no Eagles player could confirm seeing McNabb become ill, and even though none of the extensive television coverage recorded such an incident. Philadelphia Inquirer and Bleacher Report later described the rumor as only a &quot;myth&quot; and an &quot;NFL urban legend.&quot; McNabb accounted for almost 90% of the Eagles&#x27; yards from scrimmage with 30 completions for 357 yards, the third-highest total for both categories in Super Bowl history, and three touchdowns, the only points in the game for Philadelphia. Despite McNabb&#x27;s efforts, the Eagles lost by a score of 24–21.

For his 2004 efforts, McNabb was selected to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl, was named the NFC Player of the Year by CBS Radio and also by the DC Touchdown Club, and was named as the 101 Awards NFC Offensive Player of the Year.

====2005–2007: Injuries====
McNabb&#x27;s 2005 season began in turmoil and ended on the injured reserve list. While not speaking to his main target, Terrell Owens (who was temporarily barred from the Eagles&#x27; training camp for insubordination, and would be suspended by the Eagles before season&#x27;s end), and all the distractions that came with Owens&#x27; ongoing conflicts with the team, McNabb performed well in September despite a painful sports hernia and was named the NFC&#x27;s Offensive Player of the Month for the fourth time. McNabb threw 964 yards, eight touchdowns, and only two interceptions in three games, leading the Eagles to a 2–1 record. McNabb carried that momentum into October as he went 33-for-48 (68.8% completions), and threw 369 yards and three touchdowns en route to leading the Eagles to a memorable come-from-behind victory at an unfriendly Arrowhead Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs 37–31. McNabb also nearly set an NFL record as he completed 25 consecutive passes in a single game against the San Diego Chargers on October 23, 2005, but this record is not counted by the NFL as the completions were interrupted by a spiking of the ball to stop the clock at the end of the first half. The 2005 game was also noteworthy for Coach Reid calling for McNabb to have 25 pass attempts in a row, without interruption by a running play.

McNabb and Owens, to their credit, did not appear to allow the off-the-field controversies to affect their play on the field: through week 7 McNabb led the NFL in passing yards, was tied for most passing touchdowns, and targeted Owens an average of 13.14 times per game (most in the NFL since 1999 when receiver &quot;targets&quot; were first tracked, and a still-current record as of 2023), with Owens second only to Panthers WR Steve Smith Sr. in receiving touchdowns, receptions, and receiving yards at that point in 2005.

McNabb could not keep the team&#x27;s momentum rolling, as the Eagles lost four straight games. Over that span, McNabb posted a passer rating higher than 72 only once, on November 6, at the Washington Redskins. After playing the season with a sports hernia and sore thumb, McNabb&#x27;s season ended with an injury on November 14 on Monday night during a 21–20 loss to the rival Dallas Cowboys. McNabb was intercepted by Roy Williams towards the end of the game, and tried to tackle the defender when Scott Shanle came in and tackled McNabb to the ground. McNabb&#x27;s groin was injured on the play and he was placed on the injured-reserve list later that week. Mike McMahon replaced him at quarterback, and went 2–5 as a starter, with the Eagles finishing the season with a 6–10 record overall. Though low for his standards, McNabb put up respectable numbers in 2005. In nine games, he threw 2,507 yards, 16 touchdowns, and nine interceptions. To go along with that, he completed 59.1% (211–357) of his passes and was the NFL&#x27;s leader in total offense per game at the season&#x27;s end.
McNabb and the Eagles began the 2006 season with a fast start to 4–1, at that time leading the NFL in six offensive categories with McNabb becoming the first NFL quarterback to start a season with at least 1,500 yards passing, 10-plus TDs, and no more than one interception through his first five games. The Eagles began to lose momentum, stumbling to 5–4 heading into a week-11 game against the Tennessee Titans on November 19. At that time McNabb led the NFL in total offense per game, touchdown percentage, and yards per completion (also finishing the season as the NFL&#x27;s leader in those three categories), and was among the NFL&#x27;s top 3 quarterbacks for lowest interception percentage and highest TD-INT ratio. However, during the game, McNabb tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus in his right knee while jumping out of bounds, ending his season, the third time in five years McNabb had gone down with six or more games remaining in the regular season. Eagles officials stated that his rehabilitation would likely last 8–12 months, which completely ended his 2006 season and even raised questions as to whether he would be ready to begin playing by the beginning of the 2007 season. In the meantime, veteran backup quarterback Jeff Garcia took McNabb&#x27;s place as the Eagles&#x27; starting quarterback. Garcia had success, leading the Eagles from 5–5 after the Tennessee game to 10–6 and winners of the NFC East Division. The Eagles went on to win their home playoff game in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs against the New York Giants, 23–20, with Garcia under center. However, in the following Divisional Round, they were defeated by the New Orleans Saints in the Superdome, 27–24.

Having played nearly up to full speed in the preseason games, it was decided that McNabb would return to the field several months short of the full year-long recovery expected of an ACL injury. In the season opener against the Green Bay Packers, the Eagles and McNabb suffered a 16–13 loss. McNabb had his share of problems, completing less than half of his passes for 184 yards and one touchdown. The Eagles lost their first home game of the season to the rival Washington Redskins, 20–12, though his numbers improved. As week 3 approached, skeptics had already wondered whether McNabb still had the skill that propelled him to success in the past. The Eagles defeated the Detroit Lions in a 56–21 win in week 3. McNabb completed 21 of his 26 attempted passes for 381 yards. Four of those passes went for touchdowns (three of them went to Kevin Curtis), all in the first half. He was 14 of 15 for 332 yards in the first half. His performance against the Lions was highlighted by his first perfect (158.3) quarterback rating game. However, week 4 did not prove to be as good as the Eagles thought it would be. The Eagles endured yet another loss, this time to the New York Giants. The Giants&#x27; defense, led by defensive end Osi Umenyiora, sacked McNabb a record-tying 12 times. McNabb completed 15 of 31 attempted passes for 138 yards and no touchdowns. The Eagles split their next four games. In Week 10, in the Eagles&#x27; second divisional game against Washington, McNabb passed for four touchdowns in the 33–25 victory. In the following game, against the Miami Dolphins, McNabb injured his right ankle and missed the next two games. He finished the 2007 season with 3,324 passing yards, 19 passing touchdowns, and seven interceptions in 14 games.

During a win against the Cowboys, sideline reporter Pam Oliver reported during the game that McNabb indicated that he did not expect to be back in Philadelphia for the 2008 season. McNabb later indicated that this was not true, and stated that although he believed rookie Kevin Kolb&#x27;s time would come, he would be an Eagle the next season.

====2008====

At the conclusion of the 2007 season, McNabb faced criticism for asking for &quot;playmakers&quot; on his yardbarker blog. He did, however, deny he was taking a shot at anyone in particular, saying &quot;We were 8–8. There is room for improvement.&quot;

McNabb caused another mild stir in camp when he suggested that the Eagles should not have lost a game to any of their NFC East opponents the previous season. He felt that they were just a few plays away from being a playoff team. He even went on to say, &quot;I still put us at the top of the NFC.&quot; In week 1 of the 2008 NFL season, McNabb threw for 361 yards (the most of any quarterback that week) and three touchdowns, which included a 90-yard toss to Hank Baskett at the end of the second quarter. This performance led to him receiving the FedEx Air Player of the Week award. In week 3 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, McNabb threw his 176th career touchdown, passing Ron Jaworski and becoming the Eagles&#x27; all-time touchdown-pass leader.

McNabb set a career high with 58 passing attempts (completing 28), and tied a career high with three interceptions in the NFL&#x27;s first tie game in six years, when the Eagles faced the Cincinnati Bengals and ended up with a 13–13 tie. McNabb later admitted that he was not aware that an NFL regular-season game could end in a tie, leading to controversy because this could have affected game strategy. After the game, he stated &quot;I never even knew that was in the rulebook. It&#x27;s part of the rules, and we have to go with it. I was looking forward to the next opportunity to get out there and try to win the game. I hate to see what happens in the Super Bowl, and I hate to see what happens in the playoffs, to settle with a tie.&quot;

After the tie, McNabb struggled in a game against the Baltimore Ravens, going 8-of-18 for 54 yards with two interceptions and a fumble, and being sacked twice. In the second half, Andy Reid decided to go with Kevin Kolb, who was in his second year in the league. This was McNabb&#x27;s first time being benched for something other than injury or a meaningless game. In the game, Kolb threw an interception that was returned 108 yards for a touchdown by safety Ed Reed, breaking Reed&#x27;s own previous record.

Despite his up-and-down season, McNabb helped the Eagles reach the playoffs for the seventh time in his nine seasons as a starter. He also set a career high with 3,916 yards passing, led the Eagles to a franchise-record 416 points, and set a new NFL record for lowest career interception percentage, 2.09%, breaking the previous record of 2.11% set by Neil O&#x27;Donnell in 1995. At that time, McNabb&#x27;s career touchdown-to-interception ratio was third-best in league history (2.16), behind only Tom Brady (2.29) and Steve Young (2.17).

In the Wild Card Round, McNabb threw 300 yards, including a 71-yard touchdown to Brian Westbrook, to lead Philadelphia to a 26–14 upset win on the road over the Minnesota Vikings.

On January 11, 2009, McNabb and the Eagles upset the defending champions, the New York Giants, on the road in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. The Eagles won 23–11 and advanced to the NFC Championship against the Arizona Cardinals. The Eagles defeated the Cardinals earlier in the season but recognized them as a dangerous opponent, in part because the Cardinals were only the third team in NFL history with a trio of 1,000-yard wide receivers from the regular season. The Eagles traveled to Arizona for their third straight road game, hoping to become only the fourth wild card team since 1970 to win three consecutive road games to play in the Super Bowl. The Eagles trailed 24–6 at halftime, but stormed back in the second half to take a 25–24 lead in the fourth quarter. However, the Cardinals retook the lead with a late touchdown and prevailed 32–25 in McNabb&#x27;s last appearance in a conference championship game. McNabb was 28 for 47 for 375 yards passing (388 yards of total offense), three touchdowns, an interception, and a passer rating of 97.4. McNabb&#x27;s 388 yards of total offense were the third-most by a quarterback in any conference championship game up to that point in time (NFC or AFC), and the most up to that point in the history of the NFC championship game.

====2009====
In the 2009 NFL draft, the Eagles picked Missouri Tigers star wide receiver Jeremy Maclin to add to McNabb&#x27;s receiving corps, with Kevin Curtis and DeSean Jackson. While Curtis only caught 77 yards, Maclin had 773 yards and four touchdowns in a respectable rookie season, and Jackson was selected to the Pro Bowl after his first 1,000-yard season. Jackson&#x27;s selection was only the second time that an Eagles wide receiver was named to the Pro Bowl during McNabb&#x27;s years with the team. Another reliable target for McNabb was the new starting tight end Brent Celek, with whom he connected 76 times for 971 yards and eight touchdowns.

McNabb also encouraged the Eagles to sign quarterback Michael Vick to the team as a backup upon his release from prison for his part in a criminal dog fighting operation. McNabb had hosted and befriended Vick years before during Vick&#x27;s recruiting visit to Syracuse University, stated that he was excited that the Eagles gave Vick an opportunity to get his life back on track, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; described McNabb&#x27;s role in Vick&#x27;s signing as &quot;an act of selflessness not often seen among professional athletes.&quot;
In the season opener, McNabb led the Eagles to a 38–10 win over the Carolina Panthers. He completed 10 of his 18 passes for a total of 79 yards and two touchdowns. However, Andy Reid said the following Monday that McNabb broke a rib while rushing for a touchdown in the third quarter. The Eagles were hopeful McNabb would start in the week-2 game against the New Orleans Saints, but he was kept on the sidelines in both weeks 2 and 3. Kevin Kolb replaced him, and the Eagles lost to the Saints, but beat the Kansas City Chiefs the next week. Following the Eagles bye week in week 4, McNabb returned in the week-5 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, completing 16 of his 21 attempts for 264 yards and three touchdowns and being responsible for 210 of the 219 yards that the Eagles offense managed in total in the first half.

McNabb reached 200 career touchdowns and 30,000 career yards passed in a win against the Washington Redskins on October 26, 2009, with a 45-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson.

Philadelphia met the Dallas Cowboys in week 17 with the winner becoming the NFC East champions. The Eagles previously lost to the Cowboys in week 9, and then lost the season finale in a 24–0 shutout, setting up a rematch the following week in Dallas in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs.

The Wild Card Round rematch with Dallas proved to be just as disastrous for the Eagles as the season finale. McNabb struggled early and was unable to get the offense into a rhythm, and after a scoreless first period the Cowboys outscored the Eagles 27–7 in the second quarter. Philadelphia fell 34–14 to Dallas, marking the first time McNabb and the Eagles were winless in a playoff appearance.

McNabb faced speculation about his future with the Eagles, with some considering his possible trade value if the team began a transition at quarterback from McNabb to backup and former second round draft pick Kevin Kolb. McNabb earned Pro Bowl honors for the sixth and last time in his career, with the 2009 season being statistically one of his most productive seasons. &quot;NFL.com&quot; noted in the offseason that McNabb finished the 2000s as one of the decade&#x27;s top quarterbacks in several offensive categories even though the Eagles&#x27; most productive receiving target - by a “stunning” margin - was a running back (Brian Westbrook), followed next by two tight ends (L.J. Smith and Chad Lewis), and credited McNabb for having done much “with so little.” In 2023, others reached similar conclusions, crediting McNabb for much “heavy lifting” during his years with the Eagles, noting that none of the team&#x27;s three most productive wide receivers of the McNabb years - Todd Pinkston, James Thrash, and Reggie Brown - had any 1,000-yard receiving seasons among them.

===Washington Redskins===

In the press conference following the Eagles&#x27; loss to Dallas, and even up to April 1, Andy Reid stated that McNabb would remain the starting quarterback in Philadelphia for the 2010 season. However, on April 4, the Eagles traded McNabb to the Washington Redskins in return for a second-round (37th overall) pick in the 2010 NFL draft and a conditional third- or fourth-round pick in the 2011 NFL draft. The conditional pick became a fourth-round pick in 2011, which was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for a lower fourth-round pick in 2011 and a fourth-round pick in 2012. The fourth-round pick in 2012 was then traded, along with a 2012 third-round pick, to the Houston Texans for a lower 2012 third-round pick, which would be used to select quarterback Nick Foles and linebacker DeMeco Ryans.

In the first week of the 2010 season, McNabb and head coach Mike Shanahan led the Redskins to a 13–7 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. In week 2, McNabb nearly engineered a victory over the Houston Texans, passing for 426 yards (third-most of his career), but came up just short of a victory when the Texans prevailed 30–27 in overtime. In week 4, on October 3, McNabb played against the Eagles for the first time, returning with the Redskins to Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. Although McNabb posted only pedestrian statistics, the Redskins won 17–12. During pregame introductions, McNabb received a standing ovation from Eagles fans, then hugged former coach Andy Reid at their postgame handshake.

In week 5, McNabb struggled for the first three quarters, but rallied the Redskins to a 16–13 overtime victory against the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers at FedExField. He was 26–49 for 357 yards with one touchdown and one interception. In week 6, McNabb was 29 of 45 for 246 yards. He threw one touchdown and was intercepted twice, with the second interception coming on fourth down in the last minute of the fourth quarter against the visiting Indianapolis Colts. The Redskins fell to the Colts 27–24. McNabb&#x27;s passer rating was 67.5.

In week 8, Shanahan stated in a press conference that McNabb would remain the Redskins&#x27; starting quarterback. On November 15, 2010, McNabb signed a five-year extension worth $78 million ($3.5 million guaranteed) with a chance to make it $88 million by completing incentives. The deal stated that if McNabb was not cut or traded at the conclusion of the 2010 season, he would receive a $10 million bonus. The same day, the Redskins suffered a 59–28 loss to his former team, the Eagles, at home on&quot; Monday Night Football&quot;. McNabb finished the game going 17 of 31 for 295 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions.

On December 17, 2010, head coach Mike Shanahan relegated McNabb to the third quarterback position for the rest of this season, stating that he wanted to evaluate backup Rex Grossman in game play.

McNabb had perhaps one of the worst years of his career since 1999, posting career lows in season passer rating (77.1) and TD-INT ratio (0.9). However, at the time McNabb was demoted to third string, he was on pace to total 4,156 passing yards for the season, which would have broken the Redskins&#x27; all-time franchise record, and been the first time he had exceeded the 4,000-yard mark in his career. McNabb was ranked 100th in the first ranking of NFL players by their peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011, placing 7th among the NFC&#x27;s quarterbacks and 12th overall.

===Minnesota Vikings===
On July 27, 2011, the Washington Redskins and Minnesota Vikings came to an agreement on terms for a trade. After restructuring his contract, Washington traded McNabb to Minnesota in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in 2012 and a conditional sixth-round draft pick in 2013. McNabb was rumored to be a possible addition to the Vikings for the past three years, in part due to his relationship with then-coach Brad Childress, the former Eagles offensive coordinator. Vikings punter Chris Kluwe agreed to give McNabb his number 5 jersey, in exchange for a $5,000 donation to Kick for a Cure, McNabb to promote Kluwe&#x27;s band &quot;Tripping Icarus&quot; during a press conference, and an ice cream cone.

After starting the 2011 season with a 1–5 record, on October 18, it was announced that McNabb would no longer be the starting quarterback for the Vikings, as the job was given to rookie Christian Ponder for the remainder of the season.

McNabb requested and was granted his release from the team on December 1, 2011. Potential destinations for McNabb included the Houston Texans, Kansas City Chiefs, and his hometown Chicago Bears, all three of which lost their starting quarterbacks for the season to injury, but were still making playoff pushes. The Texans had signed Jake Delhomme and expressed no interest in McNabb, while the Bears and Chiefs put in waiver claims for Kyle Orton, who ended up with the Chiefs. The Bears subsequently signed Josh McCown, who had been unsigned since September but had familiarity with the Mike Martz offensive system run in Chicago. They decided that it was too late to add McNabb for the playoff hunt, as it would be tough to grasp the complicated offense in the short period of time.

On July 29, 2013, McNabb officially retired from professional football as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles.

==Broadcasting career==
In September 2012, McNabb joined the NFL Network as an analyst. In 2013, McNabb became an analyst on &quot;Fox Sports Live&quot;, Fox Sports 1&#x27;s flagship program, and in August 2014, it was announced that McNabb would provide color commentary alongside Dick Stockton for a few games during the 2014 NFL season for Fox. He resigned from Fox in late 2015. In August 2016, McNabb became the lead analyst for beIN Sports college football coverage, and he also joined ESPN Radio as an analyst.

On December 12, 2017, McNabb was suspended by ESPN as the organization investigated allegations of sexual harassment when he worked at NFL Network. In January 2018, McNabb and fellow football analyst Eric Davis were officially fired from the network.

On September 18, 2023, McNabb joined Outkick for a new show &quot;The Five Spot With Donovan McNabb.&quot;

==Personal life==
McNabb married his college sweetheart, Raquel Ann Sarah &quot;Roxie&quot; Nurse, in June 2003. They have four children: daughter Alexis, who was born on September 23, 2004, twins Sariah and Donovan Jr., who were born in 2008, and Devin James, who was born in 2009. The family splits their time between homes in Moorestown, New Jersey and Chandler, Arizona.

In 2002, McNabb, who holds a Bachelor of Science degree in speech communication from Syracuse University, was named to the institution&#x27;s board of trustees; he is one of the youngest trustees to have served there. McNabb currently is an athlete partner and serves on the advisory board for MODe Sports Nutrition.

McNabb is the brother-in-law of former Canadian Football League (CFL) player Richard Nurse. Through this marriage, McNabb is the uncle of Canadian ice hockey defenceman Darnell Nurse, who was the seventh overall pick by the Edmonton Oilers in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, Kia Nurse, a professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Sparks and the Canada women&#x27;s national basketball team, and Sarah Nurse, who competed on Team Canada&#x27;s national women&#x27;s hockey team at the 2018 Winter Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics.

In April 2014, McNabb served a one-day jail sentence in Maricopa County, Arizona for a 2013 driving under the influence (DUI) conviction.

On June 28, 2015, McNabb was arrested for DUI following a traffic accident in Gilbert, Arizona. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 90 days, 18 to be served in jail and the remainder under house arrest. He was also assessed a $6,000 fine and required to do 30 hours of community service. He paid his fine and began serving his time on November 30, 2015. On December 18, McNabb was released from jail after having served an 18-day sentence, and then completed a 72-day house arrest sentence.

==Charity, nonprofit, and volunteer activities==
In 2000, McNabb started his own charity called the Donovan McNabb Fund to raise awareness about diabetes. The charity has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for diabetes awareness.

In 2009, McNabb donated $2.5 million to help fund the construction of a new neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the Virtua Vorhees Hospital in Vorhersage, NJ where the family&#x27;s four children were born. The McNabb Family NICU has served patients at the hospital since 2011.

In 2019, McNabb&#x27;s wife Raquel Nurse McNabb co-founded the Caris Sports Foundation, a nonprofit organization to help provide financial aid for disadvantaged youth to participate in athletics. McNabb serves as a spokesperson for the foundation.

In 2021, McNabb co-founded The QB Legacy (QBL), a nonprofit group to provide mentoring and coaching to young quarterbacks (middle school through college) in underserved communities. In addition to quarterback skills, QBL camps educate young athletes about leadership, emotional and spiritual resilience, collegiate eligibility and recruiting, and financial literacy. Instructors include McNabb, former NFL quarterbacks Jeff Blake, Quincy Carter, Akili Smith, and other players and coaches from the NFL, CFL, and collegiate levels.

<text>The Canada Company was a private British land development company that was established to aid in the colonization of a large part of Upper Canada. It was incorporated by royal charter on August 19, 1826, under the (6 Geo. 4. c. 75) of the British parliament, which was given royal assent on June 27, 1825. It was originally formed to acquire and develop Upper Canada&#x27;s undeveloped clergy reserves and Crown reserves, which the company bought in 1827 for £341,000 ($693,000) from the Province of Upper Canada.

Founded by John Galt, who became its first Superintendent, the company was successful in populating an area called the Huron Tract – an achievement later called &quot;the most important single attempt at settlement in Canadian history&quot;.

The company is unrelated to the modern-day Canadian charity of the same name (Canada Company: Many Ways to Serve), founded in 2006 by Blake Goldring, which assists former Canadian military members and their spouses in regaining civilian employment after service in the Canadian Armed Forces.

==Acquisition of lands==
==Mission==
The Canada Company assisted emigrants by providing good ships, low fares, implements and tools, and inexpensive land. Scottish novelist John Galt was the company&#x27;s first Canadian superintendent. He first settled in York (Toronto, Ontario) but selected Guelph as the company&#x27;s headquarters, and his home. The area was previously part of the Halton Block, 42,000 acres of former Crown land. Galt would later be considered as the founder of Guelph.

The company surveyed and subdivided the massive Huron Tract, built roads, mills, and schools and advertised lots for sale to buyers in Europe. The town of Goderich was laid out on the shores of Lake Huron to be the centre of the settlement of the Huron Tract. The company then assisted in the migration of new settlers, bringing them to the area by means of a steamboat, which the company also owned, on Lake Ontario.

John Galt was dismissed and recalled to Great Britain in 1829, for mismanagement, particularly incompetent bookkeeping. General mismanagement and corruption within the company, and its close alliance with the Tory elites, known as the Family Compact, were important contributing factors to the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837.

In 1833, his colleague William &quot;Tiger&quot; Dunlop took over as Superintendent of the Company and continued Galt&#x27;s work for a short time before resigning.

==Company structure==
Appointed Secretary of the Canada Company in 1824 John Galt helped to obtain a charter for the company on 19 August 1826. On that date, the formal structure of the Canada Company was put into place by the company&#x27;s Court of Directors. John Galt, as secretary, had the first order of business. Tabling an abstract of the charter, Galt declared the name to be &quot;The Canada Company&quot; with directors and secretary as served on the Provisional Committee and listed in the charter.

At the first meeting of the board, it was declared that four directors would rotate off the Company beginning in 1829.



==Dissolution==
The company retained the mineral rights of the land it sold. In 1919, it quitclaimed and transferred those rights to the Crown. In 1922 and 1923, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario authorized the granting of those rights to landholders at a set price.

In 1928, a plaque was erected in Huron county, &quot;Pioneers of the Huron Tract 1828-1928&quot;, commemorating the work of the men who developed the Huron Tract and the families who lived there, starting in 1828.

By 1938, the Canada Company held just over of unsold land, while the company shares were valued at 10 shillings. It had become a land company in the process of liquidation. By 1950, only remained in its possession, distributed amongst Lambton County, the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville and Lanark County.

In 1951, the remaining land was disposed of, and land that was unsold became Pinery Provincial Park.

The company voted to wind up its affairs on August 12, 1953, and was dissolved on December 18, 1953.

<doc id="380213" wikidata="Q671958" url="?curid=380213" title="Thomas Fitzsimons">
<text>Thomas Fitzsimons (October 1741August 26, 1811) was an Irish-born American Founding Father, merchant, banker, and politician. A resident of Philadelphia, Fitzsimons represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress, was a delegate to Constitutional Convention, and served in U.S. Congress. He was a signatory of the Constitution of the United States. A slave owner, Fitzsimons was an early proponent of abolishing the slave trade in the newly formed nation.

==Biography==
Fitzsimons was born in the Kingdom of Ireland in 1741. In 1760 his family immigrated to Philadelphia. Fitzsimons had enough education that he could begin work as a clerk in a mercantile house. He married Catherine Meade on November 23, 1761, and formed a business partnership with her brother George. Their firm, which specialized in the West Indies trade, successfully operated for over 41 years.

===Revolutionary bent===
The firm was soon hit by the new revenue measures created to help support the finances of the Kingdom of Great Britain, including the much-reviled Stamp Act of 1765. Concerned with these ideas, Fitzsimons became active in the Irish merchant community in Philadelphia. He was a founding member of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in 1771 and later, in 1774, a steering committee organized to protest the Coercive Acts.

When Pennsylvania began mobilizing and organizing a militia to fight the British, Fitzsimons became involved. He served as captain of a company of home guards, which he raised under the command of Colonel John Cadwalader. Initially, his company served as part of the soldiers who manned posts along the New Jersey coast to defend against invasion. His unit later served as part of the reserve at the 1776 Battle of Trenton. Later in the war, he served on the Pennsylvania Council of Safety and headed a board to oversee the newly formed Pennsylvania Navy. Under this role, he helped organize the strategic resources of Pennsylvania and later provided supplies, ships, and money in support of Pennsylvanian and French forces.

===Politics===
Thomas Fitzsimons entered politics as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1783. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1789 until 1795. He was also a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention in 1787. Although not a leading member of that convention, he supported a strong national government, the end of slavery, the United States Congress&#x27;s powers to impose a tariff on imports and exports, the granting of the House of Representatives, and power in equal to the United States Senate in making treaties. Based on debates had during the convention, he was not a supporter of universal suffrage. He was one of two Catholic signers of the United States Constitution, the other being Daniel Carroll of Maryland.

Fitzsimons was a supporter of the military, and he was not shy about sharing his opinion. He is known to have been open about his agreement on not dissolving the army until absolutely necessary.

After the Constitution was established, he served in the first three sessions of the House of Representatives as a Federalist, where he favored protective tariffs and a strong navy, co-drafting the 1794 law authorizing the original six frigates of the United States Navy. He was one of nine representatives to vote against the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fitzsimons failed to win re-election in 1794, being defeated by John Swanwick, who carried seven of Philadelphia&#x27;s twelve districts with 57% of the vote. This was partially attributed to public opinion turning against the Federalist Party over the forceful suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Although he never held elective office again, Fitzsimons served in 1798 as head of the committee of merchants overseeing the subscription loan to build a warship at private expense for use in the Quasi-War.

In 1796, FitzSimons, along with James Innes of Virginia, was appointed by President John Adams to serve as one of two American members on the five-man debt commission charged under Article VI of the Jay Treaty with examining the claims of British subjects unable to collect debts incurred by Americans prior to the American Revolution. FitzSimons, Innes, and, Samuel Sitgreaves, who replaced Innes upon the latter&#x27;s death, became annoyed with the arguments used by their three British counterparts, Thomas Macdonald, Henry Pye Rich, and John Guillemard, to inflate the claims total, and FitzSimons and Sitgreaves angrily and permanently seceded from the board in July 1799. The claims were eventually disposed of by a lump-sum payment, agreed upon by United States Minister to Britain Rufus King with British Foreign Secretary Robert Banks Jenkinson and approved by President Thomas Jefferson and the Senate in 1802.

After withdrawing from politics, Fitzsimons remained active in civic and business affairs. He served as president of Philadelphia&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce, as a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, director of the Delaware Insurance Company, and a director of the Bank of North America from 1781 to 1803. He was a founder of the bank and supported efforts to found the College of Georgetown. Fitzsimons had also helped found the Insurance Company of North America.

Fitzsimons died on August 26, 1811, in Philadelphia, where he was buried in the cemetery of St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church.

<text>In topology and related areas of mathematics, a Stone space, also known as a profinite space or profinite set, is a compact Hausdorff totally disconnected space. Stone spaces are named after Marshall Harvey Stone who introduced and studied them in the 1930s in the course of his investigation of Boolean algebras, which culminated in his representation theorem for Boolean algebras.

== Equivalent conditions ==
The following conditions on the topological space formula_1 are equivalent:

* formula_1 is a Stone space;
* formula_1 is homeomorphic to the projective limit (in the category of topological spaces) of an inverse system of finite discrete spaces;
* formula_1 is compact and totally separated;
* formula_1 is compact, T0, and zero-dimensional (in the sense of the small inductive dimension);
* formula_1 is coherent and Hausdorff.

== Examples ==
Important examples of Stone spaces include finite discrete spaces, the Cantor set and the space formula_7 of formula_8-adic integers, where formula_8 is any prime number. Generalizing these examples, any product of arbitrarily many finite discrete spaces is a Stone space, and the topological space underlying any profinite group is a Stone space. The Stone–Čech compactification of the natural numbers with the discrete topology, or indeed of any discrete space, is a Stone space.

== Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras ==
To every Boolean algebra formula_10 we can associate a Stone space formula_11 as follows: the elements of formula_11 are the ultrafilters on formula_13 and the topology on formula_14 called , is generated by the sets of the form formula_15 where formula_16

Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras states that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of clopen sets of the Stone space formula_11; and furthermore, every Stone space formula_1 is homeomorphic to the Stone space belonging to the Boolean algebra of clopen sets of formula_19 These assignments are functorial, and we obtain a category-theoretic duality between the category of Boolean algebras (with homomorphisms as morphisms) and the category of Stone spaces (with continuous maps as morphisms).

Stone&#x27;s theorem gave rise to a number of similar dualities, now collectively known as Stone dualities.

== Condensed mathematics ==
The category of Stone spaces with continuous maps is equivalent to the pro-category of the category of finite sets, which explains the term &quot;profinite sets&quot;. The profinite sets are at the heart of the project of condensed mathematics, which aims to replace topological spaces with &quot;condensed sets&quot;, where a topological space &quot;X&quot; is replaced by the functor that takes a profinite set &quot;S&quot; to the set of continuous maps from &quot;S&quot; to &quot;X&quot;.

<text>The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) is a Chinese state research institute and think tank. It is a ministry-level institution under the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. 

==History==
The predecessor of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences was the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, established in 1955.

The CASS was established in May 1977 based on splitting the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with the aim of promoting the development of philosophy and social sciences, under the instruction of Deng Xiaoping. The first president was Hu Qiaomu.

In 1979, CASS Vice President Huan Xiang led the first Chinese delegation of social scientists to travel to the United States.

In 2022, Gao Xiang was appointed Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary and president of CASS. In 2024, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that a deputy director of CASS&#x27; Institute of Economics, , was detained and removed from his position after criticizing Xi Jinping&#x27;s management of the national economy in a private WeChat group.

==Structure==
The CASS is a ministry-level institution under the State Council. , CASS has over 3,200 resident scholars. As of November 2020, the CASS has 6 university departments, 42 research institutes, 6 functional departments, 5 directly affiliated institutions, and 3 directly affiliated companies. Of its functional departments, five are focused on research.

CASS houses the Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, which later became the University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

The Institute of Taiwan Studies at CASS is under the control of the Fifteenth Bureau of the Ministry of State Security. The ITS has been headed by Zhu Weidong since 2023 after its previous head, Yang Mingjie, left to lead the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations.

The Dictionary Editing Office of the Institute of Linguistics edits &quot;Xiandai Hanyu Cidian&quot; and the &quot;Xinhua Dictionary&quot;. The China Social Sciences Press was established in June 1978 under the auspices of the CASS, and has published over 8,000 books since its inception.

== Activities ==
Every quarter, CASS hosts a high-level seminar to which it invites officials from other developing countries to discuss topics including governance in China, poverty alleviation, and socio-economic development.

According to Chen Daoyin, a former professor at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, CASS &quot;is not so much an academic institution but a body to formulate party ideology to support the leadership.&quot; CASS employees periodically submit observations of colleagues&#x27; behavior to inspection teams, especially of colleagues who criticize the Chinese Communist Party in private.

<text>Osmo Antero Vänskä (born 28 February 1953) is a Finnish conductor, clarinetist, and composer.

==Biography==
Vänskä started his musical career as an orchestral clarinetist with the Turku Philharmonic (1971–76). He then became the principal clarinet of the Helsinki Philharmonic from 1977 to 1982. During this time, he started to study conducting with Jorma Panula at the Sibelius Academy, where his classmates included Esa-Pekka Salonen and Jukka-Pekka Saraste. In 1982, he won the International Besançon Competition for Young Conductors.

Vänskä became principal guest conductor of the Lahti Symphony Orchestra in 1985, and chief conductor in 1988. He concluded his tenure with the Lahti Symphony Orchestra in 2008 and is now the orchestra&#x27;s Conductor Laureate. His complete set of Sibelius symphonies with the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, also on the BIS label, has garnered widespread acclaim. He has recorded extensively with the Lahti orchestra for the BIS label, including music by Kalevi Aho, Einojuhani Rautavaara, Bernhard Crusell, Uuno Klami, Tauno Marttinen, Robert Kajanus, Sofia Gubaidulina, Joonas Kokkonen, Jan Sandström, Jean Sibelius, and Fredrik Pacius.

Vänskä was chief conductor of the Iceland Symphony Orchestra from 1993 to 1996. In 1996, he was appointed chief conductor of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (BBCSSO), and served in that capacity until 2002. With the BBCSSO, he made recordings of the complete Carl Nielsen symphonies for the BIS label. In June 2014, the Iceland Symphony Orchestra announced the return of Vänskä to the orchestra as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2014–2015 season.

In 2003, Vänskä became the music director of the Minnesota Orchestra. He and the orchestra have received critical praise, and he is regarded as having enhanced the quality of the orchestra. In 2004, Vänskä and the Minnesota Orchestra began a five-year project to record the complete Beethoven symphonies on the BIS label. In 2005, Vänskä signed a contract extension with the Minnesota Orchestra through at least 2011. In September 2009, the orchestra announced the extension of Vänskä&#x27;s contract through the 2014–2015 season. He announced his resignation on 1 October 2013, one year after management locked out the musicians in a longstanding labor dispute. In January 2014 Vänskä and the Minnesota Orchestra won a Grammy for best orchestral performance for the album of Sibelius&#x27; Symphonies Nos. 1 and 4. He was re-appointed music director of the Minnesota Orchestra in April 2014 with a two-year contract, which was extended in May 2015 to last until August 2019. In July 2017, the orchestra announced a further extension of Vänskä&#x27;s contract through the 2021–2022 season. In December 2018, the orchestra announced that Vänskä is to conclude his music directorship of the Minnesota Orchestra at the close of the 2021-2022 season. Vänskä is subsequently scheduled to take the title of conductor laureate with the Minnesota Orchestra.

In May 2008, an orchestral piece composed by Vänskä titled &quot;The Bridge&quot; was premiered by the Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, led by William Schrickel, assistant-principal bassist of the Minnesota Orchestra, with Vänskä in attendance.

In April 2019, the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra announced the appointment of Vänskä as its next music director, effective January 2020, with an initial contract of 3 years. Vänskä stood down as music director of the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra at the end of 2022.

==Personal life==
Vänskä has been married twice. He and his first wife Pirkko, a freelance drama critic, have three grown children, one of whom, Olli, plays violin in the Finnish folk metal band Turisas. The couple separated in 2009. In April 2015, Vänskä married Erin Keefe, concertmaster of the Minnesota Orchestra. The couple reside in Minneapolis. In private life, one of his hobbies is riding motorcycles.

<text>Robert Gould Shaw (October 10, 1837 – July 18, 1863) was an American officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Born into an abolitionist family from the Boston upper class, he accepted command of the first all-black regiment (the 54th Massachusetts) in the Northeast. Supporting the promised equal treatment for his troops, he encouraged the men to refuse their pay until it was equal to that of white troops&#x27; wage. 

He led his regiment at the Second Battle of Fort Wagner in July 1863. They attacked a beachhead near Charleston, South Carolina, and Shaw was shot and killed while leading his men to the parapet of the Confederate-held fort. Although the regiment was overwhelmed by firing from the defenses and driven back, suffering many casualties, Shaw&#x27;s leadership and the regiment became legendary. They inspired hundreds of thousands more African Americans to enlist for the Union, helping to turn the tide of the war to its ultimate victory. Shaw&#x27;s efforts and that of the 54th Massachusetts regiment were dramatized in the 1989 Oscar-winning film &quot;Glory&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Shaw was born in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, to abolitionists Francis George and Sarah Blake (Sturgis) Shaw, well-known Unitarian philanthropists and intellectuals. The Shaws had the benefit of a large inheritance left by Shaw&#x27;s merchant grandfather and namesake Robert Gould Shaw (1775–1853). Shaw had four sisters: Anna, Josephine (Effie), Susanna, and Ellen (Nellie).

When Shaw was five years old, the family moved to a large estate in West Roxbury, adjacent to Brook Farm, which he visited with his father. During his teens he traveled and studied for some years in Europe. In 1847, the family moved to Staten Island, New York, and settled among a community of literati and abolitionists while Shaw attended preparatory school at the Second Division of St. John&#x27;s College (now Fordham Preparatory School at Fordham University). These studies were at the behest of his uncle Joseph Coolidge Shaw, who had been ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1847. He converted to Catholicism during a trip to Rome, in which he befriended several members of the Oxford Movement, which had begun in the Anglican Church. Robert began his high school-level education at St. John&#x27;s in 1850, the same year that Joseph Shaw began studying there for entrance into the Jesuits.

In 1851, while Shaw was still at St. John&#x27;s, his uncle died from tuberculosis. Aged 13, Shaw had a difficult time adjusting to his surroundings and wrote several despondent letters home to his mother. In one of his letters, he claimed to be so homesick that he often cried in front of his classmates. While at St. John&#x27;s, he studied Latin, Greek, French, and Spanish, and practiced playing the violin, which he had begun as a young boy.

He left St. John&#x27;s in late 1851 before graduation, as the Shaw family departed for an extended tour of Europe. Shaw entered a boarding school in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, where he stayed for two years. Afterward, his father transferred him to a school with a less strict system of discipline in Hanover, Germany, hoping that it would better suit his restless temperament. While in Hanover, Shaw enjoyed the greater degree of personal freedom at his new school, on one occasion writing home to his mother, &quot;It&#x27;s almost impossible not to drink a good deal, because there is so much good wine here.&quot;

While Shaw was studying in Europe, Harriet Beecher Stowe, an abolitionist friend of his parents, published her novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852). Shaw read the book multiple times and was moved by its plot and anti-slavery attitude. Around the same time, Shaw wrote that his patriotism was bolstered after encountering several instances of anti-Americanism among some Europeans. He expressed interest to his parents in attending West Point or joining the Navy. Because Shaw had a longstanding difficulty with taking orders and obeying authority figures, his parents did not view this ambition seriously.

Shaw returned to the United States in 1856. From 1856 until 1859 he attended Harvard University, joining the Porcellian Club, and the Hasty Pudding Club, but he withdrew before graduating. He had been a member of the class of 1860. Shaw found Harvard no easier to adjust to than any of his previous schools and wrote to his parents about his discontent.

After leaving Harvard in 1859, Shaw returned to Staten Island to work with one of his uncles at the mercantile firm Henry P. Sturgis and Company. He found work life at the company office as disagreeable as some of his other experiences.

==American Civil War==

With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Shaw volunteered to serve with the 7th New York Militia. On April 19, 1861, Private Shaw marched down Broadway in Lower Manhattan as his unit traveled south to man the defense of Washington, D.C. Lincoln&#x27;s initial call-up asked volunteers to make a 90-day commitment, and after three months Shaw&#x27;s new regiment was dissolved. Following this, Shaw joined a newly forming regiment from his home state, the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry.

On May 28, 1861, Shaw was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the regiment&#x27;s Company H. Over the next year and a half, he fought with his fellow Massachusetts soldiers in the first Battle of Winchester, the Battle of Cedar Mountain, and at the bloody Battle of Antietam. Shaw served both as a line officer in the field and as a staff officer for General George H Gordon. Twice wounded, by the fall of 1862 he was promoted to the rank of captain.

Since the start of the war, abolitionists such as Massachusetts governor John A. Andrew urged enlistment of African Americans as soldiers to fight the Confederacy. This proposal was broadly opposed. Many men believed that African American troops would lack discipline, be difficult to train, and would break and run in battle. The general attitude in the North was that African American troops would prove to be an embarrassment and hindrance to regular army units.

Andrew traveled to Washington, D.C., in early January 1863 to meet with Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and repeat his argument for the use of African American troops in the Union army. Stanton was won to his side; on January 26, 1863, Stanton issued an order to Andrew to raise further volunteer regiments to fight for the Union, adding the new recruits &quot;may include persons of African descent, organized into special corps.&quot; Andrew immediately set about doing so, and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry began to be formed.

For the unit&#x27;s officers, Andrew sought a certain type of white gentleman, Most importantly, he wanted men who understood the stakes, that the success or failure of the endeavor would elevate or depress the manner in which the character of African Americans were viewed throughout the world for many years to come. Andrew wrote to many individuals prominent in the abolitionist movement, including Morris Hallowell of Philadelphia and Francis Shaw of Boston.

To command the unit, Andrew already had Shaw&#x27;s son in mind. Andrew wrote to Francis Shaw about the need to find a leader who would accept the responsibility of the command &quot;with a full sense of its importance, with an earnest determination for its success.&quot; Included in Andrew&#x27;s letter was a commission for Robert Shaw to take command of the new regiment.

Carrying the commission, Francis Shaw traveled to Virginia to speak with his son. Robert Shaw was hesitant to take the post, as he did not believe that authorities would send the unit to the front lines, and he did not want to leave his fellow soldiers. Finally he agreed to take the command. On February 6 he telegraphed his father with his decision. He was 25 years old. The command came with a colonelcy, the rank commensurate with the position of regimental commander.

Andrew had some difficulty finding enough African American volunteers in Massachusetts to form the regiment. Andrew assured recruits that they would receive the standard pay of 13 dollars a month, and that if they were captured, the government of the United States would insist they be treated as any other soldier. The Boston area provided enough recruits to form the regiment&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; Company. The remainder of the regiment was formed with black recruits from all across the North. Few were former slaves from the South. Two sons of the prominent African-American abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass volunteered to serve with the 54th.

Captain Shaw arrived in Boston on February 15, 1863, and immediately assumed his position. He was a strict disciplinarian, determined to train the men to high standards. On March 25, 1863, Shaw wrote to his father of his fledgling regiment: 


Shaw was promoted to major on March 31, 1863, and two weeks later on April 17 was made full colonel. On April 30 the regiment drew 950 Enfield rifled muskets and swords for non-commissioned officers (NCOs). By May 11 more troops had arrived in Boston than were required to man the regiment. The 55th Massachusetts was begun with the next round of new recruits.

On May 28 Shaw led the men of the 54th through the streets of Boston to the docks, where the regiment boarded a transport steamer and sailed south. The regiment was to be used in a Union campaign against Charleston, South Carolina, a major port. The 54th arrived at Port Royal Island on June 4, and was placed under the overall command of Major General David Hunter. Initially the regiment was used to provide manual labor at the loading docks, but Colonel Shaw applied for action. Four days later his regiment boarded onto transport and was sent to Hilton Head, South Carolina. From there they moved further south to St. Simons Island, Georgia, which served as their base of operations.

On June 11, 1863, the 54th was sent with the 2nd South Carolina Volunteers (who were also of African-American descent) for a raid against the town of Darien, Georgia. Overall command of the force was with the senior officer, colonel James Montgomery of the 2nd South Carolina. Upon reaching the town, Montgomery set his troops to looting it. Shaw was outraged by this behavior by Union troops.

He ordered his troops to limit their seizures to those items that would be useful for the camp, and committed only one company to the task. After the town had been emptied of all valuables and livestock, Montgomery told Shaw, &quot;I shall burn this town.&quot; To Shaw the burning of the town appeared to serve no military purpose, and he knew it would create a great hardship to its residents. In a letter to his family he recalled, &quot;I told him I did not want to take the responsibility of it, and he was only too happy to take all of it on his own shoulders.&quot; Montgomery had the town burned to the ground.

After the regiment&#x27;s return to camp, Shaw wrote to X Corps Assistant Adjutant General Lieutenant-Colonel Charles G. Halpine, seeking clarification of what was required of him. He asked if Montgomery was acting under orders from General Hunter, stating in part &quot;I am perfectly willing to burn any place which resists, or gives some reason for such a proceeding; but it seems to me barbarous to turn women and children adrift in that way; and if I am only assisting Colonel Montgomery in a private enterprise of his own, it is very distasteful to me.&quot; It is not clear if Shaw ever received an answer from Halpine, but Montgomery was in fact carrying out a policy supported by Hunter.

===Second Battle of Fort Wagner===
Colonel Shaw and the 54th Regiment were placed under the command of General Quincy Adams Gillmore and sent to Charleston, South Carolina to take part in the second attempt to take Charleston. To do so, they would have to capture Fort Wagner, which defended the southern approach to the harbor. A significant Confederate garrison had been stationed there. The fort was well armed with an assortment of heavy guns. The overall strength of the defenders was underestimated by the Union command. The Union effort was supported by two other brigades, but the approach was narrow and only one regiment could attack at a time. At the battle on July 18, 1863, the 54th approached the fort in the late afternoon and then waited out of range for a night assault. After a heavy bombardment from the sea the 54th charged forward to take the Confederate batteries. Shaw led his men into battle, shouting &quot;Forward, Fifty-Fourth, forward!&quot; The 54th crossed the moat and scaled the muddy hill of the outer wall. With the cessation of the naval bombardment the largely intact Confederate garrison left their bomb-proofs and resumed their positions on the walls. In the face of heavy fire the 54th hesitated. Shaw mounted a parapet and urged his men forward, but was shot through the chest three times. By witness testimony of the unit&#x27;s Color Sergeant, his death occurred early in the battle, and he fell on the outside of the fort. Some Confederate reports claim his body was hit as many as seven times. The fighting continued until 10 p.m. when the Union forces withdrew, having suffered heavy losses. Among the fatalities were Gen. George Crockett Strong, mortally wounded; Col. Haldimand S. Putnam shot and killed instantly; and Col. John Lyman Chatfield, mortally wounded. Shaw&#x27;s 54th Regiment suffered the heaviest losses.

Two sons of Frederick Douglass, Lewis and Charles Douglass, were with the 54th regiment at the time of the attack. Lewis was wounded shortly after Shaw fell, and retreated with the rest when the force withdrew. Another casualty was Captain Garth Wilkinson James, younger brother of philosopher William James and novelist Henry James. “Wilkie” had volunteered to serve in the 54th and was wounded in the assault on Fort Wagner.

Following the battle, commanding Confederate General Johnson Hagood returned the bodies of the other Union officers who had died, but left Shaw&#x27;s where it was, for burial in a mass grave with the black soldiers. Hagood told a captured Union surgeon that &quot;Had he [Shaw] been in command of white troops ...&quot; he would have returned Shaw&#x27;s body, as was customary for officers, instead of burying it with the fallen black soldiers.

Although the gesture was intended as an insult by Hagood, Shaw&#x27;s friends and family believed it was an honor for him to be buried with his soldiers. Efforts had been made to recover Shaw&#x27;s body (which had been stripped and robbed prior to burial). His father publicly proclaimed that he was proud to know that his son had been buried with his troops, befitting his role as a soldier and a crusader for emancipation.

In a letter to the regimental surgeon, Lincoln Stone, Frank Shaw wrote:
After the war, the Union Army disinterred and reburied all the remains—including, presumably, those of Col. Shaw—at the Beaufort National Cemetery in Beaufort, South Carolina. Their gravestones were marked as &quot;unknown.&quot;

Shaw&#x27;s sword had been stolen from the first gravesite but was recovered in 1865 from a house in Virginia and returned to his parents. It disappeared after being passed down within the family. In June 2017, it was discovered in a family attic of Mary Minturn Wood and brother Robert Shaw Wood, descendants of Shaw&#x27;s sister Susanna. They donated it to the Massachusetts Historical Society. (See .)
His silk sash was also recovered and returned to his family many years later.

==Personal life==
Shaw met Annie Kneeland Haggerty in New York at an opera party given in 1861 by his sister Susanna before the war began. The two became engaged just after Christmas in 1862. Despite misgivings by both sets of parents because of the war, they were married May 2, 1863, less than a month before Shaw&#x27;s regiment moved out. The ceremony was in New York City. The pair spent a brief honeymoon at the Haggertys&#x27; home of Vent Fort, in Lenox, Massachusetts.

Two and half years older than Shaw, &quot;Annie&quot; Shaw was widowed at the age of 28. She spent many years after the war living abroad in Europe, returning in later years when her health failed. The Haggerty property had been sold to George and Sarah Morgan, who built a large mansion there. They also kept the Haggerty home, and allowed Anna to live there when she returned from Europe. She spent the last two years of her life living at her former family house, and died in 1907, never having remarried. She is buried at the cemetery of Church-on-the Hill in Lenox.

==Memorials==

* A cenotaph at the Mount Auburn Cemetery
* In 1864, American sculptor Edmonia Lewis created a bust of Shaw.
* The Robert Gould Shaw Memorial was unveiled on May 31, 1897, at its site on the Boston Common. The large sculptural monument by Augustus Saint-Gaudens has a frieze of Shaw on horseback, accompanied by members of the 54th Regiment, as they marched through Boston to depart for the war. It was featured in the ending credits of the film &quot;Glory&quot; (1989).

* A patinated plaster cast of a slightly different design for the Shaw Memorial is now on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which also holds some drawings and plaster mock-ups of the sculpture.
* A monument to Shaw&#x27;s memory was erected by his family in the plot at Moravian Cemetery in Staten Island, New York. An annual commemoration is held there on his birthday.
* Although Shaw did not graduate from Harvard College, his name is listed on the tablets of honor in the university&#x27;s Memorial Transept.
* Fordham University likewise celebrates Shaw as an alumnus by honoring him in the University Hall of Honor, and separately in the Fordham University Military Hall of Fame.
The Robert Gould Shaw School, West Roxbury, Massachusetts, a Boston Public School, opened in 1936 but is now closed.

==Legacy and honors==
* Augustus Saint-Gaudens was commissioned to create the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial, erected on the Boston Common in May 1897. He created a large sculptural frieze of Shaw leading the troops of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, with the individuality of each man&#x27;s face and figure expressed. 
* The neighborhood of Shaw, Washington, D.C., which developed from encampments of freedmen, was named for him. 
* G.A.R. Post #146, established on December 4, 1871, was named The R. G. Shaw Post in New Bedford, Massachusetts. It was one of the first all African-American Grand Army of the Republic posts, made up of comrades from the 54th Massachusetts. The Shaw Post dissolved in 1881.
* In 2017, the sword that Shaw was carrying at his death was discovered in the attic of a family home in Hamilton, Massachusetts. The owners, siblings Robert Shaw Wood and Mary Minturn Wood, donated it to the Massachusetts Historical Society. It went on public display on July 18 that year, the anniversary of Shaw&#x27;s death.
*Shaw wrote more than 200 letters to his family and friends during the Civil War. These are held in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Digital facsimiles of this collection are publicly available. His mother edited an early selection of his letters, and worked to preserve a positive image of him as a martyr to the abolitionist cause.

The first scholarly collection of the letters, &quot;Blue-Eyed Child of Fortune: The Civil War Letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw&quot; (1992), was edited by Russell Duncan. The book includes most of Shaw&#x27;s letters and Duncan&#x27;s brief biography of the officer, described as the best of those then current about him. Reid Mitchell notes Duncan &quot;returns the historic Shaw&quot; to readers, complete with his bias against the Irish and African Americans, both typical of his time. He wrote more frequently about his fellow officers than either the white or black soldiers who served with him, but expressed pride in the 54th.

*There is an ongoing effort to recognize Shaw&#x27;s valorous actions at Fort Wagner with the Medal of Honor, which was not awarded at the time due to racial discrimination. The Fordham University Department of Military Science is actively supporting this venture.

* New England poet Robert Lowell referred to both Shaw and the Shaw Memorial in the poem &quot;For the Union Dead&quot;, which Lowell published in his 1964 collection of the same name.
* The film &quot;Glory&quot; (1989), directed by Edward Zwick, is about Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, and their battles. Written by Kevin Jarre, it stars Matthew Broderick as Shaw, and Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes, and Morgan Freeman as soldiers of the regiment.
*Colm Toibin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Master&quot; (2004), principally about writer Henry James, recounts the participation of his younger brother Wilkie James as an officer in the 54th Regiment.

*Shaw appeared in the third season of American historical documentary series Legends &amp; Lies. He is portrayed by Andrew James Bleidner.

<doc id="380235" wikidata="Q2022155" url="?curid=380235" title="Flying Cloud (clipper)">
<text>Flying Cloud was a clipper ship that set the world&#x27;s sailing record for the fastest passage between New York and San Francisco, 89 days 8 hours. The ship held this record for over 130 years, from 1854 to 1989.

&quot;Flying Cloud&quot; was the most famous of the clippers built by Donald McKay. She was known for her extremely close race with &quot;Hornet&quot; in 1853; for having a woman navigator, Eleanor Creesy, wife of Josiah Perkins Creesy who skippered &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; on two record-setting voyages from New York to San Francisco; and for sailing in the Australia and timber trades.

==Construction==

&quot;Flying Cloud&quot; was built in East Boston, Massachusetts, and intended for Enoch Train of Boston, who paid $50,000 for her construction. While still under construction, she was purchased by Grinnell, Minturn &amp; Co., of New York, for $90,000, (~$ in ) which represented a huge profit for Train &amp; Co.

A reporter for the Boston &quot;Daily Atlas&quot; of 25 April 1851 wrote, &quot;If great length [235 ft.], sharpness of ends, with proportionate breadth [41 ft.] and depth, conduce to speed, the &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; must be uncommonly swift, for in all these she is great. Her length on the keel is 208 feet, on deck 225, and over all, from the knightheads to the taffrail, 235— extreme breadth of beam 41 feet, depth of hold 21½, including 7 feet 8 inches height of between-decks, sea-rise at half-floor 20 inches, rounding of sides 6 inches, and sheer about 3 feet.&quot; &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; is often called an extreme clipper, as are many of Donald McKay&#x27;s ships, even though her deadrise was only 30 inches.

==Record voyage to San Francisco during Gold Rush==
Within six weeks of her 1851 launch &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; sailed from New York, rounded Cape Horn and made San Francisco in 89 days, 21 hours under the command of Captain Josiah Perkins Creesy. In July, during the trip, she ran 284, 374 and 334 nautical miles, a total of 992 nautical miles over the three consecutive days. In 1854 she beat her own fastest by 13 hours, setting a record that stood until 1989 when a contemporary 60 ft racing sloop, &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Child&quot;, completed the passage in 80 days, 20 hours.

In the early days of the California Gold Rush, it took more than 200 days for a ship to travel from New York to San Francisco, a voyage of more than 16,000 miles, but clipper ships quickly cut that time in half. &quot;Surprise&quot; had set a record of 91 days, 21 hours on 19 March 1851, but &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; caused a sensation later that year, cutting a week off the record, and beating the three month barrier. Three years later, in 1854, she sailed the passage faster yet, setting a record that lasted for 135 years.

===&quot;Flying Cloud&quot; vs. &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot;===
In newspaper accounts of the day, the clipper &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; was acclaimed as holding the record passage to San Francisco. After careful scrutiny of the logbooks, Cutler concludes that a case can be made for either &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; or &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; holding the record.

&quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; holds the record for fastest passage pilot-to-pilot, arriving at the San Francisco pilot grounds in 89 days and 4 hours. Because &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; spent all night between the Farallon Islands and the Golden Gate awaiting a harbor pilot, some will consider this figure as the appropriate indicator of fastest sailing performance around Cape Horn.

However, &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; holds the record time for a completed voyage from New York to San Francisco, 89 days 8 hours anchor-to-anchor.

==Woman navigator==
&quot;Flying Cloud&quot;&#x27;s achievement was remarkable under any terms. But, writes David W. Shaw, it was all the more unusual because her navigator was a woman, Eleanor Creesy, who had been studying oceanic currents, weather phenomena, and astronomy since her girlhood in Marblehead, Massachusetts. She was one of the first navigators to exploit the insights of Matthew Fontaine Maury, most notably the course recommended in his &quot;Sailing Directions&quot;. With her husband, ship captain Josiah Perkins Creesy, she logged many thousands of miles on the ocean, traveling around the world carrying passengers and goods. In the wake of their record-setting transit from New York to California, Eleanor and Josiah became instant celebrities. But their fame was short-lived and their story quickly forgotten. Josiah died in 1871 and Eleanor lived far from the sea until her death in 1900.

==Race with clipper &quot;Hornet&quot; in 1853==
&quot;Hornet&quot; had a two-day head start on &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; in their famous 1853 race. She left New York for San Francisco, 26 April 1853, with &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; departing two days later.

After the roughly 15,000-mile voyage around Cape Horn, both ships arrived in San Francisco harbor 106 days later at almost the same time, with &quot;Hornet&quot; sailing in just 45 minutes ahead of the &quot;Flying Cloud&quot;.

==British clipper to Australia and New Zealand, New Brunswick timber trade==

In 1862, &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; was sold to the Black Ball Line, Liverpool, sailing under British colors without change of name, and was soon traveling between the mother country and Australia and New Zealand. Her latter years were spent in the log trade between Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada.

==Loss of the ship==
On 19 June 1874, &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; went ashore on the Beacon Island bar, Saint John, New Brunswick. After she was refloated, it was discovered that her back was broken. The following June she was burned for the scrap metal value of her copper and iron fastenings.
==Ballad==
A well-known ballad about a ship named &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; tells the story of an Irishman who was pressed into sailing on the ship on a slaving voyage from Baltimore via Bermuda to West Africa, which led to another voyage as a pirate ship that resulted in the execution of the crew at Newgate. However, these events are nothing to do with the actual history of the clipper ship.

<doc id="380239" wikidata="Q683498" url="?curid=380239" title="Arthralgia">
<text>Arthralgia () literally means &#x27;joint pain&#x27;. Specifically, arthralgia is a symptom of injury, infection, illness (in particular arthritis), or an allergic reaction to medication.

According to MeSH, the term &quot;arthralgia&quot; should only be used when the condition is non-inflammatory, and the term &quot;arthritis&quot; should be used when the condition is inflammatory.

==Causes==
The causes of &quot;arthralgia&quot; are varied and range, from a joints perspective, from degenerative and destructive processes such as osteoarthritis and sports injuries to inflammation of tissues surrounding the joints, such as bursitis. These might be triggered by other things, such as infections or vaccinations.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis involves interviewing the patient and performing physical exams. When attempting to establish the cause of the arthralgia, the emphasis is on the interview. The patient is asked questions intended to narrow the number of potential causes. Given the varied nature of these possible causes, some questions may seem irrelevant. For example, the patient may be asked about dry mouth, light sensitivity, rashes or a history of seizures. Answering yes or no to any of these questions limits the number of possible causes and guides the physician toward the appropriate exams and lab tests.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on a specific underlying cause. The underlying cause will be treated first and foremost. The treatments may include joint replacement surgery for severely damaged joints, immunosuppressants for immune system dysfunction, antibiotics when an infection is the cause, and discontinuing medication when an allergic reaction is the cause. When treating the primary cause, pain management may still play a role in treatment.

<text>The Hamburg State Opera (in German: ) is a German opera company based in Hamburg. Its theatre is near the square of Gänsemarkt. Since 2015, the current &quot;Intendant&quot; of the company is Georges Delnon, and the current &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; of the company is Kent Nagano.

== History ==

Opera in Hamburg dates to 2 January 1678 when the Oper am Gänsemarkt was inaugurated with a performance of a biblical Singspiel by Johann Theile. It was not a court theatre but the first public opera house in Germany established by the art-loving citizens of Hamburg, a prosperous member of the Hanseatic League.

The Hamburg &quot;Bürgeroper&quot; resisted the dominance of the Italianate style and rapidly became the leading musical center of the German Baroque. In 1703, George Friedrich Handel was engaged as violinist and harpsichordist and performances of his operas were not long in appearing. In 1705, Hamburg gave the world première of his opera &quot;Nero&quot;.

In 1721, Georg Philipp Telemann, a central figure of the German Baroque, joined the Hamburg Opera, and in subsequent years Christoph Willibald Gluck, Johann Adolph Hasse and various Italian companies were among the guests.

To replace the aging wooden structure, the first stone was laid on 18 May 1826 for the &quot;Stadt-Theater&quot; on the present-day site of the Hamburg State Opera. The new theater, with seating for 2,800 guest, was inaugurated less than a year later with Beethoven&#x27;s incidental music to &quot;Egmont&quot;.

In 1873, both the exterior and interior of the structure were renovated in the reigning &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; style of the time, and again in 1891, when electric lighting was introduced.

Under the direction of Bernhard Pollini, the house mounted its first complete &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; in 1879. In 1883, the year of Wagner&#x27;s death, a cycle comprising nine of his operas commenced. The musical directors Hans von Bülow (from 1887 to 1890) and Gustav Mahler (from 1891 to 1897) also contributed to the fame of the opera house.

In the beginning of the 20th century, opera was an important part of the theatre&#x27;s repertoire; among the 321 performances during the 1907–08 season, 282 were performances of opera. The Stadt-Theater performed not only established repertoire but also new works, such as Paul Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Sancta Susanna&quot;, Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Ernst Krenek&#x27;s &quot;Jonny spielt auf&quot;, and Leoš Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Jenůfa&quot;. Ferruccio Busoni&#x27;s &quot;Die Brautwahl&quot; (1912) and Erich Wolfgang Korngold&#x27;s &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot; (1920) both had their world premieres in Hamburg. In the 1930s, after Hitler came to power, the opera house was renamed &quot;Hamburgische Staatsoper&quot;.

On the night of 2 August 1943, both the auditorium and its neighbouring buildings were destroyed during air raids by fire-bombing; a low-flying airplane dropped several petrol and phosphorus containers onto the middle of the roof of the auditorium, causing it to erupt into a conflagration.
The current Staatsoper opened on 15 October 1955 with Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;. Hamburg continued to devote itself to new works, such as Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s &quot;The Prince of Homburg&quot; (1960), Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Flood&quot; (1963), Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s &quot;Help, Help, the Globolinks!&quot; (1968), and Mauricio Kagel&#x27;s &quot;Staatstheater&quot; (1971).

In 1967, under the direction of , the Hamburg State Opera became the first company to broadcasts its operas in color on television, beginning with &quot;Die Hochzeit des Figaro&quot; (a German translation of &quot;Le Nozze di Figaro&quot;). Ten of these television productions have been released on DVD by ArtHaus Musik as &quot;Cult Opera of the 1970s&quot;, as well as separately. All of these were performed in German regardless of the original language (six were written in German, one in French, two in English, and one in Italian).

More recently, Hamburg gave the world premières of Wolfgang Rihm&#x27;s &quot;Die Eroberung von Mexico&quot; (1992) and Helmut Lachenmann&#x27;s &quot;Das Mädchen mit den Schwefelhölzern&quot; (1997), for which it received much international acclaim. The company has won the &quot;Opera House of the Year&quot; award by the German magazine Opernwelt in 1997 and in 2005.

Recent General Music Directors (GMD) have included Ingo Metzmacher and Simone Young. Young was the first female GMD in the company&#x27;s history, serving from 2005 to 2015. Kent Nagano became GMD as of the 2015–2016 season, with an initial contract of 5 seasons. In October 2017, the company announced the extension of Nagano&#x27;s Hamburg contract through 2025. Nagano is scheduled to conclude his tenure as GMD at the close of the 2024–2025 season. In February 2023, the company announced the appointment of Omer Meir Wellber as its new GMD, effective with the 2025–2026 season.

The current &quot;Intendant&quot; of the company is Georges Delnon. Delnon is scheduled to stand down as the company&#x27;s &quot;Intendant&quot; in 2025. In December 2022, the company announced the appointment of Tobias Kratzer as its next &quot;Intendant&quot;, effective in the summer of 2025.

<doc id="380252" wikidata="Q49683" url="?curid=380252" title="Grand Duchy of Lithuania">
<text>The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was a sovereign state in northeastern Europe that existed from the 13th century, succeeding the Kingdom of Lithuania, to the late 18th century, when the territory was suppressed during the 1795 partitions of Poland–Lithuania. The state was founded by Lithuanians, who were at the time a polytheistic nation of several united Baltic tribes from Aukštaitija. By 1440 the grand duchy had become the largest European state, controlling an area from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.

The grand duchy expanded to include large portions of the former Kievan Rus&#x27; and other neighbouring states, including what is now Belarus, Lithuania, most of Ukraine as well as parts of Latvia, Moldova, Poland and Russia. At its greatest extent, in the 15th century, it was the largest state in Europe. It was a multi-ethnic and multiconfessional state, with great diversity in languages, religion, and cultural heritage.

The consolidation of the Lithuanian lands began in the late 13th century. Mindaugas, the first ruler of the grand duchy, was crowned as the Catholic King of Lithuania in 1253. The pagan state was targeted in a religious crusade by the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order, but survived. Its rapid territorial expansion started late in the reign of Gediminas, and continued under the co-leadership of his sons, Algirdas and Kęstutis. Algirdas&#x27;s son Jogaila signed the Union of Krewo in 1386, bringing two major changes in the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: the conversion to Christianity of Europe&#x27;s last pagan state, and the establishment of a dynastic union between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. This marked the beginning of the rule of other countries by the patrilineal members of the Lithuanian ruling Gediminid dynasty, who since the 14th–15th centuries ruled not only Lithuania, but also Poland, Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, and Moldavia.

The reign of Vytautas the Great, son of Kęstutis, marked both the greatest territorial expansion of the grand duchy (it became one of the largest countries territorially in Europe) and the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. It also marked the rise of the Lithuanian nobility. After Vytautas&#x27;s death, Lithuania&#x27;s relationship with the Kingdom of Poland greatly deteriorated. Lithuanian noblemen, including the Radvila family, attempted to break the personal union with Poland. However, unsuccessful wars with the Grand Duchy of Moscow forced the union to remain intact.

Eventually, the Union of Lublin of 1569 created a new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In this federation, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania maintained its political distinctiveness and had separate ministries, laws, army, and treasury. The federation was terminated by the passing of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, when it was supposed to become a single country, the Commonwealth, under one monarch, one parliament and with no Lithuanian autonomy. Shortly afterward, the unitary character of the state was confirmed by adopting the Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations. However, the newly reformed Commonwealth was invaded by Russia in 1792 and partitioned between neighbouring states. A truncated state (whose principal cities were Kraków, Warsaw and Vilnius) remained that was nominally independent. After the Kościuszko Uprising, the territory was completely partitioned among the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and Austria in 1795.

==Etymology==

The name of Lithuania (&quot;Litua&quot;) was first mentioned in 1009 in Annals of Quedlinburg. Some older etymological theories relate the name to a small river not far from Kernavė, the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the would-be Grand Duchy of Lithuania, is usually credited as the source of the name. This river&#x27;s original name is Lietava. As time passed, the suffix -&quot;ava&quot; could have changed into -&quot;uva&quot;, as the two are from the same suffix branch. The river flows in the lowlands and easily spills over its banks, therefore the traditional Lithuanian form &quot;liet&quot;- could be directly translated as &quot;lietis&quot; (to spill), of the root derived from the Proto-Indo-European &quot;leyǝ-&quot;. However, the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation. On the other hand, such a fact is not unprecedented in world history. A credible modern theory of etymology of the name of Lithuania (Lithuanian: &quot;Lietuva&quot;) is Artūras Dubonis&#x27;s hypothesis that Lietuva relates to the word &quot;leičiai&quot; (plural of &quot;leitis&quot;, a social group of warriors-knights in the early Grand Duchy of Lithuania). The title of the &quot;Grand Duchy&quot; was consistently applied to Lithuania from the 14th century onward.

Naming convention of both title of ruler (&quot;hospodar&quot;) and the state changed as it expanded its territory. Following the decline of the Kingdom of Ruthenia and incorporation of its lands into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Gediminas started to title himself as &quot;King of Lithuanians and many Ruthenians&quot;, while the name of the state became the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Ruthenia. Similarly the title changed to &quot;King of Lithuanians and Ruthenians, ruler and duke of Semigallia&quot; when Semigallia became part of the state. The 1529 edition of the Statute of Lithuania described the titles of Sigismund I the Old as &quot;King of Poland, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Ruthenia, Prussia, Samogitia, Mazovia, and other [lands]&quot;.

The country was also called the Republic of Lithuania () since at least the mid-16th century, already before the Union of Lublin in 1569.

==History==

===Establishment of the state===


The first mention of the name Lithuania is found in the &quot;Annals of Quedlinburg&quot;, which describes the missionary expedition of Bruno of Querfurt to Yotvingians. In the 12th century, Slavic chronicles refer to Lithuania as one of the areas attacked by the Rus&#x27;. Pagan Lithuanians initially paid tribute to Polotsk, but they soon grew in strength and organized their own small-scale raids. At some point between 1180 and 1183 the situation began to change, and the Lithuanians started to organize sustainable military raids on the Slavic provinces, raiding the Principality of Polotsk as well as Pskov, and even threatening Novgorod. The sudden spark of military raids marked consolidation of the Lithuanian lands in Aukštaitija. The Lithuanians are the only branch within the Baltic group that managed to create a state entity in premodern times.

The Lithuanian Crusade began after the Livonian Order and Teutonic Knights, crusading military orders, were established in Riga and in Prussia in 1202 and 1226 respectively. The Christian orders posed a significant threat to pagan Baltic tribes, and further galvanized the formation of the Lithuanian state. The peace treaty with Galicia–Volhynia of 1219 provides evidence of cooperation between Lithuanians and Samogitians. This treaty lists 21 Lithuanian dukes, including five senior Lithuanian dukes from Aukštaitija (Živinbudas, Daujotas, Vilikaila, Dausprungas and Mindaugas) and several dukes from Žemaitija. Although they had battled in the past, the Lithuanians and the Žemaičiai now faced a common enemy. Likely Živinbudas had the most authority and at least several dukes were from the same families. The formal acknowledgement of common interests and the establishment of a hierarchy among the signatories of the treaty foreshadowed the emergence of the state.

===Kingdom of Lithuania===

Mindaugas, the duke of southern Lithuania, was among the five senior dukes mentioned in the treaty with Galicia–Volhynia. The Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, reports that by the mid-1230s, Mindaugas had acquired supreme power in the whole of Lithuania. In 1236, the Samogitians, led by Vykintas, defeated the Livonian Order in the Battle of Saule. The Order was forced to become a branch of the Teutonic Knights in Prussia, making Samogitia, a strip of land that separated Livonia from Prussia, the main target of both orders. The battle provided a break in the wars with the Knights, and Lithuania exploited this situation, arranging attacks on the Ruthenian provinces and annexing Navahrudak and Hrodna.

In 1248, a civil war broke out between Mindaugas and his nephews Tautvilas and Edivydas. The powerful coalition against Mindaugas included Vykintas, the Livonian Order, Daniel of Galicia and Vasilko of Volhynia. Taking advantage of internal conflicts, Mindaugas allied with the Livonian Order. He promised to convert to Christianity and exchange some lands in western Lithuania in return for military assistance against his nephews and the royal crown. In 1251, Mindaugas was baptized and Pope Innocent IV issued a papal bull proclaiming the creation of the Kingdom of Lithuania. After the civil war ended, Mindaugas was crowned as King of Lithuania on 6 July 1253, starting a decade of relative peace. Mindaugas later renounced Christianity and converted back to paganism. Mindaugas tried to expand his influence in Polatsk, a major centre of commerce in the Daugava River basin, and Pinsk. The Teutonic Knights used this period to strengthen their position in parts of Samogitia and Livonia, but they lost the Battle of Skuodas in 1259 and the Battle of Durbe in 1260. This encouraged the conquered Semigallians and Old Prussians to rebel against the Knights.

Encouraged by Treniota, Mindaugas broke the peace with the Order, possibly reverted to pagan beliefs. He hoped to unite all Baltic tribes under the Lithuanian leadership. As military campaigns were not successful, the relationships between Mindaugas and Treniota deteriorated. Treniota, together with Daumantas of Pskov, assassinated Mindaugas and his two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, in 1263. The state lapsed into years of internal fighting.

===Rise of the Gediminids===


From 1263 to 1269, Lithuania had three grand dukes – Treniota, Vaišvilkas, and Švarnas. The state did not disintegrate, however, and Traidenis came to power in 1269. Traidenis strengthened Lithuanian control in Black Ruthenia, fought with the Livonian Order, winning the Battle of Karuse in 1270 and the Battle of Aizkraukle in 1279, and assisted the Yotvingians/Sudovians to defend from the Teutonic Order. For his military assistance, Nameisis recognized Traidenis as his suzerain. There is considerable uncertainty about the identities of the grand dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis&#x27; death in 1282 and the assumption of power by Vytenis in 1295. The country&#x27;s capital was located in Kernavė until 1316 or 1321 where Traidenis and Vytenis mainly resided and led to its prosperity.

During this time, the Orders finalized their conquests. In 1274, the Great Prussian Rebellion ended, and the Teutonic Knights proceeded to conquer other Baltic tribes: the Nadruvians and Skalvians in 1274–1277, and the Yotvingians in 1283; the Livonian Order completed its conquest of Semigalia, the last Baltic ally of Lithuania, in 1291. The Orders could now turn their full attention to Lithuania. The &quot;buffer zone&quot; composed of other Baltic tribes had disappeared, and Grand Duchy of Lithuania was left to battle the Orders on its own.

The Gediminid dynasty ruled the grand duchy for over a century, and Vytenis was the first ruler of the dynasty. During his reign Lithuania was in constant war with the Order, the Kingdom of Poland, and Ruthenia. Vytenis was involved in succession disputes in Poland, supporting Boleslaus II of Masovia, who was married to a Lithuanian duchess, Gaudemunda. In Ruthenia, Vytenis managed to recapture lands lost after the assassination of Mindaugas and to capture the principalities of and Turov. In the struggle against the Order, Vytenis allied with Riga&#x27;s citizens; securing positions in Riga strengthened trade routes and provided a base for further military campaigns. Around 1307, Polotsk, an important trading centre, was annexed by military force. Vytenis also began constructing a defensive castle network along Nemunas. Gradually this network developed into the main defensive line against the Teutonic Order.

===Territorial expansion===
The expansion of the state reached its height under Grand Duke Gediminas, also titled by some contemporaneous German sources as &quot;Rex de Owsteiten&quot; (), who created a strong central government and established an empire that later spread from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. In 1320, most of the principalities of western Rus&#x27; were either vassalized or annexed by Lithuania. In 1321, Gediminas captured Kiev, sending Stanislav, the last Rurikid to rule Kiev, into exile. Gediminas also re-established the permanent capital of the Grand Duchy in Vilnius, presumably moving it from Old Trakai in 1323, which previously served as the country&#x27;s capital since 1316 or 1321. The state continued to expand its territory under the reign of Grand Duke Algirdas and his brother Kęstutis, who both ruled the state harmonically. During the inaugurations of Lithuanian monarchs until 1569, the Gediminas&#x27; Cap was placed on the monarch&#x27;s heads by the Bishop of Vilnius in Vilnius Cathedral.
Lithuania was in a good position to conquer the western and the southern parts of the former Kievan Rus&#x27;. While almost every other state around it had been plundered or defeated by the Mongols, the hordes stopped at the modern borders of Belarus, and the core territory of the Grand Duchy was left mostly untouched. The weak control of the Mongols over the areas they had conquered allowed the expansion of Lithuania to accelerate. Rus&#x27; principalities were never incorporated directly into the Golden Horde, maintaining vassal relationships with a fair degree of independence. Lithuania annexed some of these areas as vassals through diplomacy, as they exchanged rule by the Mongols or the Grand Prince of Moscow with rule by the Grand Duchy. An example is Novgorod, which was often in the Lithuanian sphere of influence and became an occasional dependency of the Grand Duchy. Lithuanian control resulted from internal frictions within the city, which attempted to escape submission to Moscow. Such relationships could be tenuous, however, as changes in a city&#x27;s internal politics could disrupt Lithuanian control, as happened on a number of occasions with Novgorod and other East-Slavic cities.

The Grand Duchy of Lithuania managed to hold off Mongol incursions and eventually secured gains. In 1333 and 1339, Lithuanians defeated large Mongol forces attempting to regain Smolensk from the Lithuanian sphere of influence. By about 1355, the State of Moldavia had formed, and the Golden Horde did little to re-vassalize the area. In 1362, regiments of the Grand Duchy army defeated the Golden Horde at the Battle at Blue Waters.

In 1380, a Lithuanian army allied with Russian forces to defeat the Golden Horde in the Battle of Kulikovo, and though the rule of the Mongols did not end, their influence in the region waned thereafter. In 1387, Moldavia became a vassal of Poland and, in a broader sense, of Lithuania. By this time, Lithuania had conquered the territory of the Golden Horde all the way to the Dnieper River. In a crusade against the Golden Horde in 1398 (in an alliance with Tokhtamysh), Lithuania invaded northern Crimea and won a decisive victory. In an attempt to place Tokhtamish on the Golden Horde throne in 1399, Lithuania moved against the Horde but was defeated in the Battle of the Vorskla River, losing the steppe region.

===One of the largest European countries, ruled by Gediminids–Jagiellonians===

Lithuania was Christianized in 1387, led by Jogaila, who personally translated Christian prayers into the Lithuanian language and his cousin Vytautas the Great who founded many Catholic churches and allocated lands for parishes in Lithuania. The state reached a peak (becoming one of the largest countries territorially in Europe) under Vytautas the Great, who reigned from 1392 to 1430. Vytautas was one of the most famous rulers of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, serving as the Grand Duke from 1401 to 1430, and as the Prince of Hrodna (1370–1382) and the Prince of Lutsk (1387–1389). Vytautas was the son of Kęstutis, uncle of Jogaila, who became King of Poland in 1386, and he was the grandfather of Vasili II of Moscow.

In 1410, Vytautas commanded the forces of the Grand Duchy in the Battle of Grunwald. The battle ended in a decisive Polish-Lithuanian victory against the Teutonic Order. The war of Lithuania against military Orders, which lasted for more than 200 years, and was one of the longest wars in the history of Europe, was finally ended. Vytautas backed the economic development of the state and introduced many reforms. Under his rule, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania slowly became more centralized, as the governours loyal to Vytautas replaced local princes with dynastic ties to the throne. The governours were rich landowners who formed the basis for the nobility of the Grand Duchy. During Vytautas&#x27; rule, the Radziwiłł and Goštautas families started to gain influence.
In 1440, Casimir IV Jagiellon was sent by his older brother Władysław III to Lithuania to rule in his name, however instead a manifestation of the sovereignty of Lithuania occurred when Casimir was elected as the Grand Duke of Lithuania upon his arrival to Vilnius on 29 June 1440 and subsequently titled himself as a &quot;free lord&quot; (&quot;pan – dominus&quot;), this way breaching the agreements of the Union of Grodno (1432) and terminating the Polish–Lithuanian union; Casimir also became the King of Poland in 1447. Following Casimir&#x27;s death in 1492, the factual termination of the Polish–Lithuanian union also occurred during the reign of Casimir&#x27;s sons Alexander Jagiellon and John I Albert who had respectively ruled Lithuania and Poland separately in 1492–1501.

The rapid expansion of the influence of Moscow soon put it into a comparable position to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and after the annexation of Novgorod Republic in 1478, Muscovy was among the preeminent states in northeastern Europe. Between 1492 and 1508, Ivan III further consolidated Muscovy, winning the key Battle of Vedrosha and capturing such ancient lands of Kievan Rus&#x27; as Chernihiv and Bryansk.

On 8 September 1514, the allied forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, under the command of Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski, fought the Battle of Orsha against the army of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, under Konyushy Ivan Chelyadnin and Kniaz Mikhail Golitsin. The battle was part of a long series of Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars conducted by Russian rulers striving to gather all the former lands of Kievan Rus&#x27; under their rule. According to &quot;Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii&quot; by Sigismund von Herberstein, the primary source for the information on the battle, the much smaller army of Poland–Lithuania (under 30,000 men) defeated the 80,000 Muscovite soldiers, capturing their camp and commander. The Muscovites lost about 30,000 men, while the losses of the Poland–Lithuania army totalled only 500. While the battle is remembered as one of the greatest Lithuanian victories, Muscovy ultimately prevailed in the war. Under the 1522 peace treaty, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania made large territorial concessions.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===

The wars with the Teutonic Order, the loss of land to Moscow, and the continued pressure threatened the survival of the state of Lithuania, so it was forced to ally more closely with Poland, forming a real union with the Kingdom of Poland in the Union of Lublin of 1569. The union was formally called the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, however now commonly known as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. During the period of the Union, many of the territories formerly controlled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were transferred to the Crown of the Polish Kingdom, while the gradual process of Polonization slowly drew Lithuania itself under Polish domination.

Following the death of Grand Duke Sigismund II Augustus in 1572, a joint Polish–Lithuanian monarch was to be elected as in the Union of Lublin it was agreed that the title &quot;Grand Duke of Lithuania&quot; will be received by a jointly elected monarch in the Election sejm on his accession to the throne, thus losing its former institutional significance, however the Union of Lublin guaranteed that the institution and the title &quot;Grand Duke of Lithuania&quot; will be preserved. 

In 1573, Henry Valua was elected as the first joint Polish–Lithuanian monarch, however his rule was short and he never personally visited the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, despite being announced as the Grand Duke of Lithuania.

The double election of 1575 was held in the presence of a small number of Lithuanian lords, who additionally supported the Habsburg candidate Emperor Maximilian II, however, the race for the crown was won by Stephen Báthory, crowned on May 1, 1576. The Lithuanian lords, at a convention in Grodno (on 8-20 April 1576), protested this choice, threatening to break the union and giving themselves the right to choose a separate ruler. However, the king managed to rally the Lithuanian delegation by promising to preserve their rights and freedoms. On May 29, 1580, in Vilnius Cathedral, King and Grand Duke Stephen Báthory received from the hand of the bishop of Samogitia Merkelis Giedraitis a blessed sword and hat, given by Pope Gregory XIII through the envoy Paweł Uchański. This was a recognition by the Pope of the ruler&#x27;s successes in the struggle against the infidels. In Lithuania, this ceremony was treated as the celebration of the elevation of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, during which Lithuania&#x27;s sovereignty was manifested. Báthory&#x27;s reign was marked with successful Livonian campaign against tsar Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s military forces, which resulted in the reintegration of Polotsk to Lithuania and the restoration of control of the Duchy of Livonia.
The rule of Lithuania by the Gediminid–Jagiellonian family representatives resumed through matrilineal line following the death of Báthory (1586) when Sigismund III Vasa (son of Catherine Jagiellon) was elected in 1587. On 28 January 1588, Sigismund III confirmed the Third Statute of Lithuania which stated that the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth is a federation of two countries – Poland and Lithuania where both countries have equal rights within it and separated the powers of the ruler, the Seimas, the executive and the courts (this for the first time in European history ensured the rule of law in the state, but Lithuania&#x27;s citizens, who were subjects to the Statute, were only nobles). During the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611) Polish and Lithuanian forces achieved victory and restored &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, notably winning the decisive Battle of Kircholm in 1605, while during the Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618) Polish and Lithuanian armies achieved territorial gains (e.g. restored the control of Smolensk, the capital of the Smolensk Voivodeship, in 1611) and for the first time fully captured Russia&#x27;s capital Moscow in 1610. Sigismund III&#x27;s son, Władysław IV Vasa, began ruling Lithuania in 1632 and achieved military success and popularity during the Smolensk War, but he renounced his claims to the Russian throne per the Treaty of Polyanovka in 1634 and failed at reclaiming the Swedish throne.

John II Casimir Vasa&#x27;s reign was initially marked with disastrous military loses as during the Deluge in the mid-17th century most of the territory of Lithuania was annexed by the Tsardom of Russia and even the Lithuania&#x27;s capital Vilnius was captured for the first time by a foreign army and ravaged. In 1655, Lithuania unilaterally seceded from Poland, declared the Swedish King Charles X Gustav as the Grand Duke of Lithuania and fell under the protection of the Swedish Empire. However, by 1657 Lithuania was once again a part of the Commonwealth following the Lithuanian revolt against the Swedes. The Lithuania&#x27;s capital Vilnius was liberated in 1661.

Throughout this Polish–Lithuanian Union period, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania remained a separate state and retained many rights in the federation (including separate name, territory, coat of arms, ministries, ruling system, laws, army, courts, treasury, and seal) until the Constitution of 3 May and Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations were passed in 1791.

===Partitions and the Napoleonic period===
Following the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, most of the lands of the former Grand Duchy were directly annexed by the Russian Empire, the rest by Prussia. In 1812, just prior to the French invasion of Russia, the former Grand Duchy revolted against the Russians. Soon after his arrival in Vilnius, Napoleon proclaimed the creation of a Commissary Provisional Government of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania which, in turn, renewed the Polish-Lithuanian Union. The union was never formalized, however, as only half a year later Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was pushed out of Russia and forced to retreat further westwards. In December 1812, Vilnius was recaptured by Russian forces, bringing all plans for the recreation of the Grand Duchy to an end. Most of the lands of the former Grand Duchy were re-annexed by Russia. The Augustów Voivodeship (later Augustów Governorate), including the counties of Marijampolė and Kalvarija, was attached to the Kingdom of Poland, a rump state in personal union with Russia.

==Religion and culture==
===Christianity and paganism===


After the baptism in 1252 and coronation of King Mindaugas in 1253, Lithuania was recognized as a Christian state until 1260, when Mindaugas supported an uprising in Courland and (according to the German order) renounced Christianity. Up until 1387, Lithuanian nobles professed their own religion, which was polytheistic. Ethnic Lithuanians were very dedicated to their faith. The pagan beliefs needed to be deeply entrenched to survive strong pressure from missionaries and foreign powers. Until the 17th century, there were relics of old faith reported by counter-reformation active Jesuit priests, like feeding žaltys with milk or bringing food to graves of ancestors. The lands of modern-day Belarus and Ukraine, as well as local dukes (princes) in these regions, were firmly Orthodox Christian (Greek Catholic after the Union of Brest), though. While pagan beliefs in Lithuania were strong enough to survive centuries of pressure from military orders and missionaries, they did eventually succumb. A separate Eastern Orthodox metropolitan eparchy was created sometime between 1315 and 1317 by the Constantinople Patriarch John XIII. Following the Galicia–Volhynia Wars which divided the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, in 1355 the Halych metropoly was liquidated and its eparchies transferred to the metropoles of Lithuania and Volhynia.

In 1387, Lithuania converted to Catholicism, while most of the Ruthenian lands stayed Orthodox, however, on 22 February 1387, Supreme Duke Jogaila banned Catholics marriages with Orthodox, and demanded those Orthodox who previously married with the Catholics to convert to Catholicism. At one point, though, Pope Alexander VI reprimanded the Grand Duke for keeping non-Catholics as advisers. Consequently, only in 1563 did Grand Duke Sigismund II Augustus issue a privilege that equalized the rights of Orthodox and Catholics in Lithuania and abolished all previous restrictions on Orthodox. There was an effort to polarise Orthodox Christians after the Union of Brest in 1596, by which some Orthodox Christians acknowledged papal authority and Catholic catechism, but preserved their liturgy. The country also became one of the major centres of the Reformation.
In the second half of the 16th century, Calvinism spread in Lithuania, supported by the families of Radziwiłł, Chodkiewicz, Sapieha, Dorohostajski and others. By the 1580s the majority of the senators from Lithuania were Calvinist or Socinian Unitarians (Jan Kiszka).

In 1579, Stephen Báthory, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, founded Vilnius University, one of the oldest universities in Northern Europe. Due to the work of the Jesuits during the Counter-Reformation the university soon developed into one of the most important scientific and cultural centres of the region and the most notable scientific centre of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The work of the Jesuits as well as conversions from among the Lithuanian senatorial families turned the tide and by the 1670s Calvinism lost its former importance though it still retained some influence among the ethnically Lithuanian peasants and some middle nobility.

===Islam===
Islam in Lithuania, unlike many other northern and western European countries, has a long history starting from 14th century. Small groups of Muslim Lipka Tatars migrated to ethnically Lithuanian lands, mainly under the rule of Grand Duke Vytautas (early 15th century). In Lithuania, unlike many other European societies at the time, there was religious freedom. Lithuanian Tatars were allowed to settle in certain places, such as Trakai and Kaunas. Keturiasdešimt Totorių is one of the oldest Tatar settlements in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After a successful military campaign of the Crimean Peninsula in 1397, Vytautas brought the first Crimean Tatar prisoners of war to Trakai and various places in the Duchy of Trakai, including localities near Vokė river just south of Vilnius. The first mosque in this village was mentioned for the first time in 1558. There were 42 Tatar families in the village in 1630.

===Judaism===

==Languages==

===Linguistic groups===

The majority of inhabitants of Lithuania proper, which included the voivodeships of Vilnius, Trakai and Samogitia, spoke Lithuanian. These areas remained almost wholly Lithuanian-speaking, both colloquially and by ruling nobility. Despite its frequent oral use, Lithuanian did not begin to be used in writing until the 16th century.

Ruthenians, ancestors of modern Belarusians and Ukrainians, living in the eastern and southern lands of the Grand Duchy spoke Ruthenian language. The Ruthenian language had an old writing tradition. The language of the Orthodox Church was Old Church Slavonic, while official documents used the so-called Chancery Ruthenian, close to but not identical to the spoken language, which over time absorbed many Lithuanian and Polish words.

Some Poles (mainly burghers, clergy, merchants, and szlachta) moved to Lithuania, although this migration was small-scale. After the Union of Lublin, this movement significantly increased. Polish was adopted also gradually by the local inhabitants. Already in early 16th century, Polish became the Lithuanian magnates&#x27; first language. The following century it was adopted by the Lithuanian nobility in general. The Polish language also penetrated other social strata: the clergy, the townspeople, and even the peasants. Since the 16th century, Polish was used much more often than other languages for writing. Polish finally became the Commonwealth&#x27;s official chancellery language in 1697.

Other important ethnic groups throughout the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were Jews and Tatars. Jews spoke mainly in the eastern dialect of Yiddish. The Lithuanian Tatars used a language of Kipchak origin that was full of borrowings from Turkish and Arabic. It ceased to be used in the 16th century, and was replaced by Ruthenian and Polish, written in the Arabic alphabet. Brought in 1397 from Crimea, Karaites used a dialect of West Karaite language, while Hebrew was used for religious purposes.

In addition, Livonia, which had been politically connected to the Grand Duchy since the mid-16th century, was inhabited by Latgalians who spoke a dialect of the Latvian language. Inhabiting the towns, mainly in Livonia, the mostly Protestant Germans used a local variety of German called &quot;Baltendeutsch&quot;. Prussian and Yotvingians refugees, pushed out by the Teutonic Knights, also found their footing in the Grand Duchy. Similarly, Russian Old Believers emigrated to Lithuanian lands in the 17th century.

=== Languages of administration ===

The Grand Duchy&#x27;s linguistic and ethnic situation, as well as the fusion of Lithuanian and Ruthenian elements in its culture, became the trigger for a long-running debate among historians from Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine over whether the state was essentially Lithuanian or Ruthenian-Lithuanian, in which the more advanced Ruthenian culture played a central role.

Before the Lithuanian expansion into the Ruthenian lands, Lithuanian was the only language of public life. However, the conquests, already initiated by Mindaugas in 13th century, began the process of fusing Ruthenian and Lithuanian culture and, in the absence of its own writing tradition, adopting Ruthenian as the language of administration and written communication. From at least the time of Vytautas, but probably much earlier, the language of internal administration was Chancery Ruthenian, a language similar to, but not the same as, the spoken language used by Ruthenians living in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. As for the correspondences with foreign courts the grand ducal chancellery prepared it in the language appropriate to the recipient: Latin for the correspondence with the West, German with the Teutonic Order and Chancery Ruthenian with the East Slavic and Tatar rulers.
The language used at court continued to be Lithuanian until the mid-16th century, the other being Ruthenian; later, both languages began to be replaced by Polish. Ruthenian culture dominated the courts of the Gediminid princes since the 14th century, especially those ruling directly over Ruthenian subjects. Grand Duke Jogaila was most likely bilingual, knowing and speaking Lithuanian and Ruthenian, and was able to communicate in the Samogitian dialect of the Lithuanian language. The Lithuanian language was still strongly present at the Vilnius court of Casimir Jagiellon, who had to learn it when he assumed power in the Grand Duchy in 1444. Casimir&#x27;s assumption of power in Poland in 1447 marked the end of the existence of a separate court in Vilnius (it later existed only in years 1492–1496 and 1544–1548). Many Lithuanians and Ruthenian nobles joined the court in Kraków, they learned Polish language over time. Casimir was the last Grand Duke to know the Lithuanian language. From 1500, the elite of the Lithuanian state rapidly adopted the Polish language.

The process of moving away from Ruthenian to Polish in administration was soon apparent. The first were the nobles of Podlachia, who adopted Polish laws as early as the 1440s, and repeatedly demanded that official documents be written in Polish, since they no longer knew Ruthenian. The political reforms of 1564–1566 established sejmiks, local land courts, appellate courts modelled on Polish system, through which the Polish language flowed into Lithuania. The first codification of Lithuanian laws, the Statute of Lithuania, was issued in Chancery Ruthenian (1529), but was quickly translated into Latin (1530) and Polish (1532). Court Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Lew Sapieha noted in the preface of the Third Statute of Lithuania (1588) that all state documents to be written exclusively in Ruthenian. Despite this, after the Polish translation of the statute was published in 1614, it was not reissued in Ruthenian ever again. Polish was increasingly used in official documents, especially after the Union of Lublin. Finally, in 1697, the Sejm, as part of the equalization of law between Lithuania and Poland, confirmed that only the Polish language was to be used in administration in Lithuania, although Ruthenian continued to be used on a few official documents until the second half of the 18th century.
After the baptism, the use of Latin, still the main language of learning and writing in Western Europe, also spread in Lithuania as a language of document. Latin was the second language of the grand ducal chancellery in the 14th–16th centuries, although it was used less frequently than Ruthenian in internal administration. This was accompanied by the spread since mid-15th century of the legend of the Roman origin of the Lithuanian nobility (from the Palemon lineage), and the closeness of the Lithuanian language and Latin. This let some intellectuals in the mid-16th century to advocate for replacement of Ruthenian with Latin, as they considered Latin as the native language of Lithuanians.

Despite the appearance of literature in Lithuanian in the 16th century, the language did not gain the status of a chancellery language in the Grand Duchy until the late 18th century. Unlike neighboring Prussia, where the custom of issuing official documents in Lithuanian, especially those addressed to Lithuanian subjects, appeared as early as the 16th century. The Prussian chancellery translated two universals of 1639 and 1641 prepared by the royal chancellery of Władysław IV in Latin forbidding the passage of his subjects from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to Prussia, which was then a Polish fief. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the first document in Lithuanian was a translation from the Polish text of the May 3 Constitution, which was issued in 1791. Subsequently, several documents were published in Lithuanian during the Kościuszko Uprising. Of course, Lithuanian was used in speech, in administrative offices and by government officials when dealing with residents who were unable to communicate in another language. Vilnius city charter of November 18, 1551 declared that summons to court and verdicts had to be announced in Lithuanian, Polish, and Ruthenian. A similar charter was issued in Kaunas in 1540.

==Demographics==

In 1260, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the land of Lithuania, and ethnic Lithuanians formed the majority (68%) of its 400,000 people. With the acquisition of new Ruthenian territories, in 1340 this portion decreased to 30%. By the time of the largest expansion towards Rus&#x27; lands, which came at the end of the 13th and during the 14th century, the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was 800 to 930 thousand km2, just 10% to 14% of which was ethnically Lithuanian.

On 6 May 1434, Grand Duke Sigismund Kęstutaitis released his privilege which tied the Orthodox and Catholic Lithuanian nobles rights in order to attract the Slavic nobles of the eastern regions of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania who supported the former Grand Duke Švitrigaila.

An estimate of the population in the territory of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania together gives a population at 7.5 million for 1493, breaking them down by ethnicity at 3.75 million Ruthenians (ethnic Ukrainians, Belarusians), 3.25 million Poles and 0.5 million Lithuanians. With the Union of Lublin, 1569, Lithuanian Grand Duchy lost large part of lands to the Polish Crown.

According to an analysis of the tax registers in 1572, Lithuania proper had 850,000 residents of which 680,000 were Lithuanians.

In the mid and late 17th century, due to Russian and Swedish invasions, there was much devastation and population loss on throughout the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, including ethnic Lithuanian population in Vilnius surroundings. Besides devastation, the Ruthenian population declined proportionally after the territorial losses to Russian Empire. By 1770 there were about 4.84 million inhabitants in the territory of 320 thousand km2, the biggest part of whom were inhabitants of Ruthenia and about 1.39 million or 29% – of ethnic Lithuania. During the following decades, the population decreased in a result of partitions.

==Legacy==

Prussian tribes (of Baltic origin) were the subject of Polish expansion, which was largely unsuccessful, so Duke Konrad of Masovia invited the Teutonic Knights to settle near the Prussian area of settlement. The fighting between Prussians and the Teutonic Knights gave the more distant Lithuanian tribes time to unite. Because of strong enemies in the south and north, the newly formed Lithuanian state concentrated most of its military and diplomatic efforts on expansion eastward.

The rest of the former Ruthenian lands were conquered by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Some other lands in Ukraine were vassalized by Lithuania later. The subjugation of Eastern Slavs by two powers created substantial differences between them that persist to this day. While there were certainly substantial regional differences in Kievan Rus&#x27;, it was the Lithuanian annexation of much of southern and western Ruthenia that led to the permanent division between Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians, and even four Grand Dukes of Lithuania are appeared on the Millennium of Russia monument.

In the 19th century, the romantic references to the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were an inspiration and a substantial part of both the Lithuanian and Belarusian national revival movements and Romanticism in Poland.

Notwithstanding the above, Lithuania was a kingdom under Mindaugas, who was crowned by the authority of Pope Innocent IV in 1253. Vytenis, Gediminas and Vytautas the Great also assumed the title of King, although uncrowned by the Pope. A failed attempt was made in 1918 to revive the Kingdom under a German Prince, Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, who would have reigned as Mindaugas II of Lithuania.

In the first half of the 20th century, the memory of the multiethnic history of the Grand Duchy was revived by the people connected with the Krajowcy movement, such as Ludwik Abramowicz, Konstancja Skirmuntt, Michał Pius Römer, Juozapas Albinas Herbačiauskas, Józef Mackiewicz and Stanisław Mackiewicz. This feeling was expressed in poetry by Czesław Miłosz.
The Act of Independence of Lithuania, signed by the Council of Lithuania on February 16, 1918, proclaimed that &quot;the Council of Lithuania, as the sole representative of the Lithuanian nation, based on the recognized right to national self-determination, and on the Vilnius Conference&#x27;s resolution of September 18–23, 1917, proclaims the restoration of the independent state of Lithuania, founded on democratic principles, with Vilnius as its capital, and declares the termination of all state ties which formerly bound this State to other nations&quot;. In the preamble of the most recent Constitution of Lithuania, adopted during the 1992 Lithuanian constitutional referendum, the continuity of Lithuanian statehood is also stressed.

Pseudoscientific theory of litvinism was developed since the 1990s.

Famous Lithuanian sports clubs BC Žalgiris and FK Žalgiris as well the largest indoor arena in Lithuania are named after the Battle of Grunwald ().

According to the 10th article of the &quot;Law on the State Flag and Other Flags of the Republic of Lithuania&quot; (), adopted by the Seimas, the historical Lithuanian state flag (with horseback knight on a red field, which initial design dates back to the reign of Grand Duke Vytautas the Great) must be constantly raised over the most important governmental buildings (e.g. Seimas Palace, Government of Lithuania and its ministries, Lithuanian courts, municipal council buildings) and significant historical buildings (e.g. Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, Trakai Island Castle), also in Kernavė and in the site of the Senieji Trakai Castle.

<text>A football chant or terrace chant is a form of vocalisation performed by supporters of association football, typically during football matches. Football chanting is an expression of collective identity, most often used by fans to express their pride in the team they support, or to encourage them, and to celebrate a particular player or manager. Fans may also use football chants to slight the opposition, and many fans sing songs about their club rivals, even when they are not playing them. Sometimes the chants are spontaneous reactions to events on the pitch.

Football chants can be simple, consisting of a few loud shouts or spoken words, but more often they are short lines of lyrics and sometimes longer songs. They are typically performed repetitively, sometimes accompanied by handclapping, but occasionally they may be more elaborate involving musical instruments, props or choreographed routines. They are often adaptations of popular songs, using their tunes as the basis of the chants, but some are original.

Football chants are known to have been used by fans from the late 19th century onwards, but developed into the current popular forms in the 1960s. Football chants can be historic, dating back as early as the formation of the club popularly sung down the years and considered the anthems for these clubs. They may also be popular for only a relatively short time, with new chants being constantly created and discarded. The tradition of football chants vary from country to country and team to team, but some chants are common to many clubs and popular internationally. Football chants may be considered one of the last remaining sources of an oral folk song tradition.

==History==
Football chants may be considered modern examples of traditional storytelling and folk songs. According to folk singer Martin Carthy, football chants are &quot;the one surviving embodiment of an organic living folk tradition.&quot; It is also a unique public expression of collective identity, and football chants may be seen as modern examples of the folk tradition &quot;blason populaire&quot; where a group vocalise their identity as well as their rivalry against another group.

===Early chants===
Football fans&#x27; vocalisations came in the forms of cries, chants and songs in the 19th century. War cries were known to have been used by football fans from the 1880s onwards, with the earliest recorded in Scotland after the Scottish Cup final of 1887. The first known song that references football, &quot;The Dooley Fitba&#x27; Club&quot; later known as &quot;&#x27;Fitba&#x27; Crazy&quot;, was also written in the 1880s by James Curran, although it was intended for the music hall rather than the terrace. It was also recorded in the 1890s that Sheffield United fans had adopted a music hall song, the &quot;Rowdy Dowdy Boys&quot;, while Southampton fans sang a &quot;Yi! Yi! Yi!&quot; chant based on a war cry. Blackburn Rovers fans were reported to have chanted &quot;We&#x27;ve won the cup before – many a time&quot; before their 1891 FA Cup Final match against Notts County. Composer Sir Edward Elgar wrote a football song in honour of the Wolverhampton Wanderers striker, Billy Malpass, after watching a match in February 1898 between Wolves and Stoke City. However, the anthem he wrote, &quot;He Banged The Leather For Goal&quot;, never caught on among fans on the terrace.

The oldest football song in the world that is still in use today may be &quot;On the Ball, City&quot;, a song believed to have been composed in the 1890s by Albert T Smith, who became a director of Norwich City in 1905. The song was adopted by fans of the club and it is still sung by Norwich&#x27;s fans. Such club song may have its origin in the public school system, while others have links with working-class music hall. Other early football chants still sung today include &quot;Pompey Chimes&quot; or &quot;Play up, Pompey&quot; sung by Portsmouth fans since the 1920s (a form of the chant is believed to have been sung at Fratton Park in 1899, therefore it is arguably older than &quot;On the Ball, City&quot;), and &quot;Blaydon Races&quot;, a Geordie folk song from 1862, which was adopted by Newcastle United fans in the 1930s. Some of the songs sung at football ground by the 1920s were modified from popular music hall songs, for example &quot;Kick, Kick, Kick, Kick, Kick it&quot; from &quot;Chick, Chick, Chick, Chick, Chicken&quot; and &quot;Keep the Forwards Scoring&quot; from &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot;. Chants that referenced players were also heard on the terrace; for example, &quot;Give it to Ballie&quot; chanted by Swansea fans in reference to a player name Billy Ball who played for the club in 1912-1920.

Football chants in the early years were club-specific and they were generally friendly or jocular in tone. Songs with sectarian overtones, however, had been sung at matches between Rangers and Celtic in the 1920s, which became more overtly confrontational in later decades, raising the possibility that sectarianism may have been the origin of oppositional chanting and singing at football matches. Fans of the early period also had a limited repertoire of chants, which become more varied as singing was encouraged by the use of brass bands before games and the community singing movement that arose in the 1920s (the tradition of singing &quot;Abide with Me&quot; at FA Cup finals started in this period).

===1960s developments===
While various elements of football chants were already present in the early period, it was in the 1960s that the nature of football chants started to change and modern football chants emerged to become an integral part of fan culture and experience. The catalyst for the change may be due to a number of factors; one suggestion is the growth and evolution of youth culture in this period which, together with popular music started being played over the public announcement system at matches instead of brass bands, encouraged fans to start their own singing based on popular tunes. Another suggestion is the mixing of fan cultures from different countries through international football matches that started to be broadcast, such as the 1959 England&#x27;s tour of South America and the 1962 World Cup. The exposure to intense chanting by South American and Italian fans during the 1962 and 1966 World Cups may have encouraged British fans who were previously more reserved to do the same. They also picked up different type of chants from other countries; Liverpool fans for example, may have used a Brazilian chant &quot;Brazil, cha-cha-cha&quot; and turned it into the &quot;Li-ver-pool, [clap, clap, clap]&quot; chant.

Chants became more extensive in the 1960s, and popular songs became increasingly common as the basis of chants as fans adapted these songs to reflect situations and events relevant to them. Chanting the name of the team, chants for players and managers started to become prevalent. Liverpool supporters, particularly those on the Kop, were known for modifying songs in the early 1960s to suit their own purposes, and this practice quickly spread to fans of other clubs who created their own versions after hearing these chants. Repertoire of chants credited to Liverpool fans included the rhythmic clapping based on &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; by The Routers, the chorus from &quot;We Shall Not Be Moved&quot;, and &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot; used to honour Ian St John, chants which were then also adopted by fans of other clubs. Fans of many clubs now have a large and constantly evolving repertoire of chants in addition to a smaller number of songs closely associated with their club.

A more controversial aspect of this period of change was that abusive chants targeted at rival team or fans also became widespread. These may be taunts and insults aimed at the opposition teams or players to unnerve them, or obscene or slanderous chants targeted at individuals. A sampling of English football chants in the late 1970s found these types of chants to be the most numerous. Threats of violence may also be made to their rivals in chants; although such threats were rarely carried out, fights did occur which, together with increasing level of hooliganism in that period, gave these threats a real edge. Some abuses are racial in nature; for example, anti-Semitic chants directed at Tottenham Hotspur began in the 1960s, also against the Argentine club Atlanta (commonly heard in the 1960s but may have begun as early as the 1940s), and against the Dutch club Ajax in the 1970s. Racist insults directed at black players began to be heard in the 1970s and 1980s in England and Spain when black players started appearing in their leagues in increasing numbers. Concerns over the abusive nature of some of these chants later led to measures in various countries to control them, for example, the British government made racist and indecent chants an offence in the UK in 1991. In Italy, the Mancino law was used to prosecute fans for inciting racism. Despite efforts to stop them, some chants remain an issue around the world, such as the &quot;Eh puto&quot; chant used by Mexican fans, and racist chants in many countries.

===International spread===
As the sport of football spread to other countries, so did its associated fan culture of football chants. Many countries, however, have developed their own tradition of football songs and chants; for example, most Italian clubs have their own official hymns, often written specially for the club by a prominent singer or composer who is a fan of the club. Many countries also have football chants dating from the early part of the 20th century, and clubs such as Real Madrid may have an official club song as early as 1903. Football chants created in different countries may be specific to the local culture. Hand-clapping chants were popular in South American countries such as Brazil before it spread to other countries. Some chants originated from other sports; for example, the &quot;two, four, six, eight!&quot; chant that was used for sports in the United States from the early 20th century was adopted by football fans in the UK in the 1950s. The &quot;Olé&quot; chant from bullfighting is believed to be first used in Brazil for Garrincha in 1958, and one version of the &quot;Olé, Olé, Olé&quot; chant was first heard at a league game in Spain in 1982, while another version quickly spread around Europe in 1986 and became widely popular around the world.

As football fans travel to other countries on away international matches, and international broadcasts of football matches are common, fans from around the world often picked up chants from other clubs and countries, and some chants spread in an organic manner and become popular internationally. An example is the chant based on &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; by The White Stripes – it was first adopted by fans of Belgian Club Brugge KV in 2003, their chant was then picked by Italian fans, and it was made an unofficial anthem for the Italy national football team in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, following which it spread to other football clubs around the world as well as beyond football into other sports and events.

==Common types of chants==
A wide variety of football chants exist, some of the more popular ones may be grouped into the following types:

===Tragedy chanting===
Tragedy chanting involves chanting about an opposition club&#x27;s tragedies or tragic events that happen in their home cities. Instances in English football include exchanges between Manchester United and Leeds United fans, and between Manchester United and Liverpool fans.

==Spoken chants==
Some chants are spoken, sometimes accompanied by percussion. These chants may simply consist of the name of the team and/or words of encouragement. The chants may also be in a call-and-response format. For example, Chile national football team fans will do a routine whereby one group of fans will chant &quot;Chi-Chi-Chi&quot;, and another group will respond &quot;Le-Le-Le&quot;. For the Indonesia national football team one group of fans will chant &quot;In-Do-Ne-Sia&quot; with an air horn and hand clap in response. &quot;Garuda Di Dadaku&quot; is sung by fans when Indonesia plays at home.

Popularised at the Sydney Olympics and used by Australian football supporters everywhere is the &quot;Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi&quot; chant between two groups of supporters. It is a derivation of Welsh rugby chant &quot;Oggy Oggy Oggy&quot;, which was also adapted by Chelsea supporters in tribute to Peter Osgood. A version &quot;Zigger Zagger Oi Oi Oi&quot; has been suggested to be based on a German toast &quot;Zicke zacke zicke zacke hoi hoi hoi&quot;.

In the United States, despite a lower popularity of association football, &quot;I believe that we will win!&quot; and &quot;U-S-A!&quot; are generally chanted during matches US national teams are playing on the world stage. The chant &quot;U-S-A!&quot; has also been used outside of sports, such as in the halls of Congress during rallies of American support.

Some chants consist simply of a loud shout or whoop with a hand clap, sometimes led by a drum beat that gets increasingly faster, such as the Viking Thunder Clap made popular by fans of Iceland. Similar chants have been performed by fans of teams such as Motherwell and Lens, and a version called &quot;Boom Boom Clap&quot; has been used by fans of North American clubs such as Seattle Sounders FC and Toronto FC since 2008 as well as the American national teams.

===Fighting chants===

&quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Get Your Fucking Head Kicked In&quot;, sometimes pluralised to &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Get Your Fucking Heads Kicked In&quot;, is a football chant originating in England. It is also used as a case study in psychology and sociology. The chant is often used as an intimidatory chant towards the opposing fans rather than as an actual threat of violence, but there have been a number of occasions when it has led to a fight between fans. The chant is sometimes used after the opposition have scored. It is now considered to be a dated chant with little current usage in English football culture despite being in common use in the 1970s and 80s.

==Chants based on hymns and classical music==
Several football chants are based on hymns, with &quot;Cwm Rhondda&quot; (also known as &quot;Guide me, O thou great redeemer&quot;) being one of the most popular tunes to copy. Amongst others, it has spawned the song &quot;You&#x27;re not singing anymore!&quot;, &quot;We support our local team!&quot;, and &quot;I will never be a Blue!&quot;.

Various teams have used the &quot;Glory Glory&quot; chant (used by &quot;Tottenham Hotspur&quot;, &quot;Leeds United&quot;, &quot;Manchester United&quot;, etc.), to the tune of the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. Hibernian were the first team to use the song with the release of a record by Hector Nicol in the 1950s (&quot;Glory Glory to the Hibees&quot;).

The Stars and Stripes Forever is often sung with the words &quot;Here we go, here we go, here we go!&quot;.

There have been various adaptations of &quot;When The Saints Go Marching In&quot; (e.g. by fans of Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur), and the tune of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot; chorus.

Many football crowd chants/songs are to the tune of &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; from Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, for example the chant by Derby County fans in honour of Fabrizio Ravanelli of &quot;We&#x27;ve got Fabrizio, you&#x27;ve got fuck allio&quot;.

Italian tifosi employ various operatic arie, especially those by Giuseppe Verdi, for chants. For Parma&#x27;s home matches at the Stadio Ennio Tardini, during the entry of the teams in the field, Aida&#x27;s triumphal march resounds as Verdi is a symbol of the city.

Italian Torino fans sing their signature chant &quot;Toro alè&quot; to the tune of French anthem &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;.
The anthem theme was first popularized as a chant by A.S. Roma&#x27;s curva sud after a 3-1 match win against Juventus on 30 January 1977. The anthem has also been modified by the RC Lens fans.

French PSG fans sing a rendition of &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;.

Arsenal fans have been singing &quot;Good old Arsenal&quot; to the tune of Rule Britannia since the 1970-71 season when they won the double.

Most Turkish teams have been using the theme of To Brazil by Vengaboys with their own team&#x27;s lyrics.

==Chants based on spirituals and folk songs==
Some chants are based on spirituals. &quot;We shall not be moved&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot; are both used by fans. An example of the latter&#x27;s use was &quot;He&#x27;s got a pineapple on his head&quot; aimed at Jason Lee due to his distinctive hairstyle. The song was later popularised by the television show &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;.

Christmas carols have also been used as chants like with the theme of &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot; by the likes of Manchester United or Chelsea fans.

The tune to the Shaker song &quot;Simple Gifts&quot; has spawned many terrace chants including &quot;Carefree&quot;, a chant associated with Chelsea. It was also used for a Tottenham song abusing Sol Campbell after his move to Arsenal in 2001 and was sung by Manchester United fans, in honour of Park Ji-Sung. Chelsea fans also adapted the song &quot;One Man Went To Mow&quot; as an anthem.

&quot;Sloop John B&quot; has been popular amongst English football fans since the mid-2000s. It was adopted by the supporters of English non-league team F.C. United of Manchester as a club anthem in 2007.

The Geordie folk song &quot;Blaydon Races&quot; is associated with Newcastle United. Other folk songs to have their lyrics altered include &quot;The John B. Sails&quot; to &quot;We Won it 5 Times&quot; by Liverpool fans, &quot;She&#x27;ll Be Coming &#x27;Round the Mountain&quot; to &quot;We&#x27;ll Be Coming Down the Road&quot; by the Scotland national team and Liverpool fans, &quot;My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean&quot;, &quot;The Wild Rover&quot; and &quot;Camptown Races&quot;, which is used for &quot;Two World Wars, One World Cup&quot;, whilst Birmingham City fans sing &quot;Keep Right on to the End of the Road&quot;.

The melody of &quot;Bella ciao&quot; is often used as a chant by Italian ultras groups of Salernitana, Cosenza Calcio, A.S. Livorno and also outside of Italy like with Aris Thessaloniki, AEK Athens F.C. or Paris Saint-Germain F.C. fans, as well as the Timbers Army of MLS&#x27; Portland Timbers. The song was also adapted by Brazilian fans during World Cup 2018 to tease and taunt Argentina about their possible exit in the first round, which eventually did not occur, with references to Argentinian players Di María, Mascherano, and Messi (Brazil and Argentina have a well-known football rivalry).

Italian tifosi are strongly used to sing mocks based on national, and internationally famous folk tunes, like &quot;L&#x27;uva fogarina&quot;, &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot; and &quot;Alouette&quot;.

&quot;The Fields of Athenry&quot; is a widely used anthem by Irish sports fans, sang particularly at rugby and football matches. The song was adopted and reworked by Liverpool fans as &quot;The Fields of Anfield Road&quot;.

==Chants based on popular music==
Popular music is the most common source of football chants. In the United Kingdom, music hall songs such as &quot;My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)&quot;, &quot;Knees Up Mother Brown&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot;, &quot;I Came, I Saw, I Conga&#x27;d&quot; and &quot;Two Little Boys&quot; have long been used as the basis of terrace chants. Popular standards such as &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;, Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, and the 1958 Eurovision entry &quot;Volare&quot; are also widely adapted to suit players and managers. The Cuban song &quot;Guantanamera&quot; became popularly used as a chant in the UK as a version by The Sandpipers charted soon after the 1966 World Cup; it is commonly sung in a large variety of chants, for example in the form of &quot;There&#x27;s only one [player&#x27;s name]&quot;, or &quot;You only sing when you&#x27;re winning&quot;. The tune &quot;Tom Hark&quot; is often played at many stadiums following a goal by the home team and for chants such as &quot;Thursday Nights, Channel 5&quot;, whilst &quot;Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)&quot; by Doris Day is generally reserved for matches where the venue of the final is Wembley Stadium.

The rhythm, rather than the melody, of &quot;Let&#x27;s Go (Pony)&quot; by The Routers is widely used for clapping, drumming or banging by fans worldwide.

Music of the 1960s influenced terrace chants. &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; by Johnny Cash and &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot; by Dean Martin have been used by several sets of fans. &quot;Lola&quot; by The Kinks, and &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot; by Jeff Beck have been adapted by several clubs – most prolific of these include Aston Villa, Sheffield Wednesday and Wolverhampton Wanderers. &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; by The Beatles are often used. Songs from musicals have become very popular as football chants, such as &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot; from the 1964 musical &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. Some early songs became popular as football chants later, for example the Venezuelan song &quot;Moliendo Café&quot; popular in early 1960s first became used as a chant in Argentina in the late 1970s, which spread to Italy as &quot;Dale Cavese&quot; chants in 2006 and then later to clubs around the world.

The emergence of funk and disco in the 1970s also made its mark on the terraces with songs such as &quot;Go West&quot; by the Village People and &quot;Oops Up Side Your Head&quot; by The Gap Band remaining popular amongst fans. &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&quot; by Rufus and Chaka Khan has been used by Arsenal fans and others. Music popular in the 1980s and 1990s is also used widely. Chants have been based on &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; by Depeche Mode, &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; by Joy Division, &quot;Pop Goes the World&quot; by Men Without Hats, the Band Aid song &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Pigbag&quot; by Pigbag and &quot;This Is How It Feels&quot; by Inspiral Carpets. Other chants have used tunes from on pop songs include &quot;Three Lions&quot;, the official England anthem for Euro &#x27;96 and Manic Street Preachers song &quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next&quot;.

Fans of a number of different clubs in the United Kingdom have adopted &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot; by Status Quo as a chant. Liverpool fans sing &quot;Scousers all over the world&quot;. Arsenal fans sing &quot;Saka and Emile Smith Rowe&quot;. Rangers fans sing &quot;Gerrard stopped ten in a row&quot;, in reference to the club winning the 2020-21 Scottish Premiership under manager Steven Gerrard and breaking bitter rivals Celtic&#x27;s nine-year monopoly on the title.

Fans in England sing &quot;Leeds are falling apart again&quot; to the tune of &quot;Love will tear us apart&quot; by Joy Division to mock fans of Leeds United.

More recent releases to have their music appropriated include &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; by The White Stripes, which became highly popular across nations. A number of songs became popular in the 2010s, an example being &quot;Freed from Desire&quot;, which is used to celebrate particular players – it was first popularised as &quot;Will Grigg&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, then used for others such as &quot;Vardy&#x27;s on Fire&quot; and &quot;Grizi&#x27;s on Fire&quot;. An Italian disco song &quot;L&#x27;estate sta finendo&quot; became popular among European clubs such as Napoli, Juventus, Porto, Atlético Madrid and others as &quot;Un giorno all&#x27;improvviso&quot;, later picked up Liverpool fans, who created their own version as &quot;Allez Allez Allez&quot; for their 2017–18 UEFA Champions League campaign, and it then spread to other British clubs in the 2018–2019 season. In late 2017, &quot;September&quot; by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire had a big impact in English stadia. In 2022, fans of Tottenham Hotspur crafted a chant for Dejan Kulusevski to the tune of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot;.

==Chants based on nursery rhymes and theme tunes==
Football crowds also adapt tunes such as nursery rhymes and theme tunes. &quot;The Farmer in the Dell&quot; known in some regions as &#x27;The Farmer Wants A Wife&#x27;, provides the famous chant of &quot;Ee Aye Addio&quot;, a tune which also provides the first bars of the 1946 be-bop jazz classic &quot;Now&#x27;s The Time&quot;, by alto saxophonist Charlie Parker. The marching tune &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; is also used a basis for songs, such as &quot;His Armband Said He Was a Red&quot;, sung by Liverpool fans in honour of Fernando Torres while he was still at the club. Chelsea fans then adapted the chant to match their own colours when Torres was transferred to the London club in 2011, with &quot;He&#x27;s now a Blue, he was a Red.&quot; Manchester United used the song to describe Torres and his looks too after he missed an open goal. United also used the song about John O&#x27;Shea after he scored a goal against Derby in the Carling Cup in 2009.
The children&#x27;s song &quot;Ten Green Bottles&quot; became &quot;Ten German Bombers&quot;, to the tune of &quot;She&#x27;ll Be Coming &#x27;Round the Mountain,&quot; both songs used by English fans to their main rivals, Germany. The nursery rhyme &quot;This Old Man&quot; is sung by both supporters of Manchester United and Manchester City. The &quot;Theme from Z-Cars&quot; has been used in Everton&#x27;s Goodison Park ground since 1962.

Theme tunes which have been used as chants include &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;The Banana Splits&quot;.

==Club-specific songs==
Some football teams also have songs which are traditionally sung by their fans. The song &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; from &quot;Carousel&quot; is associated heavily with Liverpool. In 1963, the song was covered by Liverpool group Gerry and the Pacemakers, which prompted the song&#x27;s adoption by the Kop. At this time, supporters standing on the Spion Kop terrace at Anfield began singing popular chart songs of the day. The mood was captured on camera by a BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; camera crew in 1964. One year later, when Liverpool faced Leeds in the FA Cup final, the travelling Kop sang the same song and match commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme commended the &quot;Liverpool signature tune&quot;. Other songs sung by Liverpool fans include &quot;Poor Scouser Tommy&quot; based on &quot;Red River Valley&quot;.

Fans of West Ham United were said to have adopted the song &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot; at Upton Park in the mid-1920s, although no record of West Ham fans singing the song existed until 1940.

Manchester City has been strongly associated with the classic popular song &quot;Blue Moon&quot; since the late 1980s. The song is now an established and official part of the club&#x27;s brand and culture: &#x27;Blue Moon&#x27; is also the name of the club&#x27;s leading fansite, images of a blue moon (a moon that&#x27;s blue in colour, not the astronomical phenomenon) appear on licensed and fan-made clothing and merchandise, and the team&#x27;s mascots are a pair of blue aliens from the Moon named &#x27;Moonchester&#x27; and &#x27;Moonbeam&#x27;.

&quot;Blue Is the Colour&quot; is the song for Chelsea. The song was released in 1972 when the club reached the 1972 League Cup Final. Chelsea fans also sing the &quot;celery&quot; song, waving and hurling sticks of celery while singing, starting in the early 1980s.

&quot;Go West&quot; by the Village People has been co-opted by fans of Arsenal F.C., using the words &quot;1-0 to the Arsenal&quot; as a reference to the club&#x27;s defensive style of football under former manager George Graham. The same &quot;1-0 to the Arsenal&quot; was also often sung, in ironic spirit, by fans of opposition by way of mocking their perceived boring style of play during this time.. The tune is also used by supporters of Leyton Orient with the words &quot;Stand Up for The Orient&quot;

&quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot; is sung by fans of Bristol Rovers, while &quot;Drink Up Thy Zider&quot; by The Wurzels is sung by Bristol City fans.

Tottenham fans sang the song as &quot;We are Tottenham, from the Lane&quot;, and variations of the same chant are sung by fans of other clubs.

==Chant Laureate==
On 11 May 2004, Jonny Hurst was chosen as England&#x27;s first &quot;Chant Laureate&quot;. Barclaycard set up the competition to choose a Chant Laureate, to be paid £10,000 to tour Premier League stadia and compose chants for the 2004–05 football season. The judging panel was chaired by the Poet Laureate Andrew Motion, who said &quot;What we felt we were tapping into was a huge reservoir of folk poetry.&quot;

== Argentine fútbol chanting ==
Following the work of Pablo Alabarces and others, Eduardo Herrera suggests that soccer chanting in Argentina allows participants to create value around and give meaning to the idea of &quot;aguante,&quot; which is &quot;central in the construction of an ideal masculinity.&quot; &quot;Aguante&quot; translates to &quot;endurance&quot; or &quot;stamina&quot; in English. In practice, aguante is part of a masculine discourse that &quot;divides the world between &#x27;real men&#x27; and &#x27;not men.&#x27; Garriga Zucal and Daniel Salerno have identified three main signs of &quot;aguante&quot;. The first is &quot;alentar siempre,&quot; which means to show support for the team throughout the entire match by jumping or chanting, even through bad weather or poor performance by the team. Secondly, to show &quot;aguante&quot;, a man must show up to all the matches, including away games that require long, uncomfortable trips. Thirdly, a fan must withstand confrontation to demonstrate &quot;aguante&quot;, either through chanting at opposing fans or through physical fights.

Participating in chanting or &quot;cantitos&quot; is a major way the &quot;barras bravas&quot;, or the most important militant groups of fans, can demonstrate &quot;aguante&quot;. The &quot;barras bravas&quot;, who are also known as the &quot;hinchada militante&quot;, stand throughout the game behind the goal and chant the entire time. These groups bring instruments to the matches in order to synchronize the chanting. The most prominent instrument is the &quot;bombo con platillo&quot;, which is a large bass drum with a diameter of 22-24 inches. The &quot;bombos con platillo&quot; are often decorated with the team&#x27;s colors and name and the name of the &quot;barra&quot; group, which is distinct from the team name. Along with these drums, other types of drums include Brazilian &quot;surdo&quot; drums, &quot;redoblantes&quot; (snare drums), and &quot;repiques&quot;. The &quot;barras&quot; often have other percussion instruments, including scrappers, tambourines, cowbells, and agogo bells. In addition to percussion, most &quot;barras&quot; have at least three trumpet players, and many teams might add trombones or euphoniums. While the &quot;bombo&quot; players are always from the &quot;barras bravas&quot; itself, because of the advanced skill it takes to play the brass instruments, the &quot;barras&quot; sometimes hire outside brass players to play during a match.

In the ensemble, one &quot;bombo&quot; player serves as the leader of the group, where he leads with exaggerated arm movements that are easy for the players to follow, but the leader of the chanting is often falls to another leader of the &quot;barras&quot;. They might lead by giving verbal or visual cues to the head &quot;bombo&quot; player, or they might just independently start a chant and expect the ensemble to follow.

<text>JMC Airlines Limited (also known as JMC Air, JMC Airlines or simply JMC and stylised as jmc) was a charter airline in the United Kingdom formed by the merger of Caledonian Airways and Flying Colours Airlines, following the purchase of Thomas Cook &amp; Son by the Carlson Leisure Group. JMC Air primarily served the Thomas Cook holidays brand and was rebranded in March 2003 to Thomas Cook Airlines UK. 

== History ==
JMC Air was initially announced in 1999, with a five year, £200m rebranding plan to join three of Thomas Cook&#x27;s holiday brands Sunworld, Sunset, Inspirations and Flying Colours and Caledonian airlines. JMC Air was named after the initials of the son of Thomas Cook, John Mason Cook. JMC Air&#x27;s managing director was Terry Soult who had previously served the same role with Flying Colours. It started operating under the JMC Air name from March 2000. The main operating bases were London Gatwick Airport and Manchester Airport. Aircraft were also stationed at London Stansted Airport, Birmingham International Airport, Bristol Airport, Glasgow International Airport, Cardiff Airport and Newcastle Airport. JMC Air also operated flights from Leeds Bradford Airport. At the start of operations the fleet consisted of Boeing 757-200, Airbus A320, Airbus A330-200 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft. 

In 2000, Thomas Cook was sold to C&amp;N Touristic, a German based group backed by Lufthansa and rebranded as Thomas Cook AG. JMC Air became closely linked to Condor as a result of the acquisition, and was estimated to control 16% of all European charter airline seats. During the same year, JMC faced legal action from 20 tourists who fell ill on a package holiday in Majorca. JMC Air were also part of an eight airline consortium that attempted to buy the British National Air Traffic Services. 

Prior to launch in 1999, JMC Air sought to acquire Boeing&#x27;s latest 757-300 aircraft which led to them becoming the first UK operator of the -300 in 2001. By late 2001, Thomas Cook made over 550 staff redundant of which 100 were with JMC Air. JMC Air also closed three bases in the UK, as a result of lower passenger numbers in the wake of the September 11 attacks. In November of the same year, a JMC Air flight from Newcastle to Tenerife was diverted due to a drunk passenger incident, which led to the passenger being arrested and jailed for four months. In the same month, JMC Air took delivery of two leased Airbus A330-200 aircraft via CIT Aerospace and Tyco Capital. The aircraft were configured in a two class layout and powered by Rolls-Royce Trent engines. The aircraft were primarily used for long-haul operations to the Caribbean and United States.

In early 2002, a JMC Air passenger successfully won damages for suspected deep vein thrombosis as a result of a long-haul flight from Calgary to Manchester. In May, it was announced JMC Air would be rebranded as Thomas Cook for summer 2003. Around this time, JMC were considering a move to offer flight only bookings to compete with no-frills carriers such as Easyjet. The first Thomas Cook liveried aircraft took to the skies in late 2002.

In 2003, JMC Air was noted as the best UK charter airline for shortest delays by Holiday Which, having taken an average 33 minute delay in 2001 down to an average of 13 minutes in 2002. In the same year, Sufyan Sadiq, a 16 year old travelling with Stamford College was denied boarding of a JMC Air flight from Gatwick Airport after joking with staff that he had a gun in his luggage. JMC Air concluded operations in March 2003, becoming Thomas Cook Airlines whilst JMC was retained as a family holiday brand under the Cook&#x27;s package holiday umbrella.

<doc id="380264" wikidata="Q3299675" url="?curid=380264" title="Matthew Brady">
<text>Matthew Brady (1799 – 4 May 1826) was an English-born convict who became a bushranger in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (modern-day Tasmania). He was sometimes known as &quot;Gentleman Brady&quot; due to his good treatment and fine manners when robbing his victims.

==Early life==
Brady, whose proper name was Bready, was born in Manchester at just about the close of 18th century. His occupation in England was that of a gentleman&#x27;s servant, probably a groom, as he was an excellent and even a graceful rider, and perfect in his horsemanship.

==Convict years==
Brady was convicted of stealing a basket, some butter, bacon, sugar, and rice, and tried at Lancaster on 17 April 1820. He received a seven-year sentence of transportation, arriving in Australia in the convict ship &quot;Juliana&quot; on 29 December 1820.

He rebelled against the conditions in Sydney and received, over time, a total of 350 lashes in punishment for misdemeanours and attempts to escape. In 1823, he was sent to the new penal settlement at Sarah Island in Macquarie Harbor, which had been established &#x27;for secondary offenders and desperate prisoners&#x27;.

On 7 June 1824, Brady was part of a group of fifteen escapees from Sarah Island who sailed a whaleboat around the south coast to the River Derwent and spent the next two years as bushrangers.

==Bushranging==
Brady was considered a gentleman who rarely robbed or insulted women. The military considered him a dangerous bushranger after Brady&#x27;s gang held up the township of Sorell and captured the local garrison (in which the garrison commander, Lieut. William Gunn was shot in the arm, which was subsequently amputated). On 14 April 1825 Lieut. Governor George Arthur posted rewards for the capture of Brady and his gang of 25 pounds sterling and a conditional pardon.

In return, Brady posted his own reward stating:

In November 1825, a description of the Brady&#x27;s gang of bushrangers was published, provided by Mr. R. Denne, overseer for Silas Gatehouse near Grindstone Bay ( north-east of Hobart). Denne had spent six days in the custody of the gang. He described his captors as having no fixed leader, &quot;though the opinions of Brady or Dunne are generally listened to&quot;, adding that &quot;they frequently debate and quarrel for hours together, about their future proceedings&quot;. Denne provided the following descriptions of the gang members:
* Brady, called &#x27;Mat&#x27; by his comrades, was described as being &quot;stout, square-built&quot;, and slightly marked with smallpox. 
* Dunne was taller, &quot;with red whiskers, and pock-pitted&quot;.
* Bird was dark, tall and athletic, with &quot;the appearance of a gipsy&quot;; he had lost part of one of his fingers.
* McKenney was shorter, stouter, and &quot;fresh complexioned&quot;.
* Brown was described as being deaf.
* Murphy was a &quot;little man&quot;, with &quot;a piece of gold lace, with a precious stone, round his cap&quot;.
* Cody was &quot;subject, at times, to dreadful stings of conscience&quot;.
* Bryan (no description beyond his name).

On 4 March 1826, Brady and his gang of fourteen attacked Mr. Dry&#x27;s homestead at night. It was a new moon so the night was particularly dark. A servant managed to run to town and call alarm. A posse of troopers responded and a gunfight ensued. No one was killed and the bushrangers slipped away into the night. Three days later, Brady rode to Tom Kenton&#x27;s farm and shot him dead. It was a payback for Kenton setting a trap on Brady. Brady was briefly captured but managed to escape and swore revenge. Days later Brady and his gang captured a boat, intending to sail it to the Australian mainland. Due to bad weather crossing Bass Strait, they were forced to turn back.

===Capture===
After the sailing fiasco, one of Brady&#x27;s gang members, an ex-convict name Cowan, betrayed him for a pardon. On 28 March 1826, in consequence of private information, Lieutenant Williams of the 57th Regiment with 14 soldiers and four armed prisoners made contact with Brady&#x27;s gang south of Launceston. Both parties fired, and during the ensuing gun battle Brady was wounded in the leg. The bushrangers separated as they fled. Two stragglers were caught by local farmers.

Brady and four others made it as far as Watery Plains ( south-east of Launceston). On 1 April, a campfire was spotted and John Batman and party went to investigate. The outlaws all fled into the bush, abandoning their fire. Batman and his crew stayed near the campfire. During the night Batman heard a noise and went out to investigate. He saw a man limping in the bush near a shallow creek and hastened towards him; it was Brady. Batman induced Brady to surrender and return with him. The outlaw was ill and suffering much pain and did as he was asked. 

In the morning of 2 April, Batman delivered Brady to the Launceston gaol. News quickly spread that Brady was caught and the townsfolk turned out to see the captured felon pass by on horseback.

===Sentencing===

On 27 April 1826, Brady and Patrick Bryant pleaded guilty to the murder with malice of Thomas Kenton. The same two also pleaded guilty of stealing four horses from Mr. Lawrence.

Brady was duly sentenced to death.

==Death==
Brady was hanged on 4 May 1826, at the old Hobart gaol. Four other bushrangers were hanged with him: Patrick Bryant, John Perry, John Thompson, and Thomas Jeffrey. Brady complained bitterly at being hanged alongside Jeffrey, who, as Brady pointed out, was an informer as well as a cannibal and mass murderer. There were multiple unsuccessful petitions to halt his execution, and his cell was filled with wine, fruit, cakes, confectionary, and flowers from the ladies of Hobart Town.

The &quot;Herald&quot; wrote of his death:
==Legacy==
One of his hideouts is now known as Brady&#x27;s Lookout and is a popular picnic area with views over the Tamar River.
There is also another of his hide outs at Notley Hills Gorge, with a lovely bush walk, and an information board about Brady.

His life was dramatised on radio in &quot;The Capture of Sorrell Gaol&quot;, an episode of &quot;Thereby Hangs a Tale&quot; in 1950.

In 1955, he was the subject of a radio feature &quot;Matt Brady, Bushranger: The Adventures of a Gay Rogue.&quot;

<doc id="380266" wikidata="Q1592865" url="?curid=380266" title="Rossini Opera Festival">
<text>The Rossini Opera Festival (ROF) is an international music festival held in August of each year in Pesaro, Italy, the birthplace of the opera composer Gioachino Rossini. Its aim, in addition to studying the musical heritage of the composer, is to revive and perform his works in a unique setting that allows collaboration of scholars, artists, and audience. It is often simply referred to as the Pesaro Festival.

Performances are given in the 850-seat theatre built in 1818, the Teatro Rossini and, since 1988, the modified sports arena (Palasport) which holds 1,500, as well as, since 2006, Vitrifrigo Arena, with over 10,000. Since 2000 another venue, the Teatro Sperimentale (Experimental Theatre), has offered the opportunity to present smaller-scale or minor works by contemporaries of Rossini such as Mosca, Generali, and Coccia. The main square of Pesaro, the Piazza del Popolo, also hosts outdoor performances. It will be extensively used during the Festival&#x27;s 2020 season, which was modified due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Rossini&#x27;s music in Pesaro==
Prior to the establishment of the Festival, it was not uncommon to see productions of Rossini&#x27;s music taking place to mark occasions in his life and death. Thus, in 1868 when the composer died in Paris, his Stabat Mater was performed along with &quot;Semiramide&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot;. The first centennial of Rossini&#x27;s birth in 1892 saw &quot;L&#x27;occasione fa il ladro&quot; and the twentieth-century seasons saw many Rossini operas including many quite obscure ones.

==The Festival established in 1980==
The Festival was established in 1980 with the aim of making the world more aware of Rossini&#x27;s neglected operas and presenting all of them in collaboration with the Casa Ricordi music publishing house, which published their critical editions. Of the approximately three dozen operas written, only a handful are regularly presented.
On 13 August 1993, the Italian parliament unanimously approved the Special Law N. 319 &quot;Regulations in support of the Rossini Opera Festival&quot;, which recognizes the Pesaro Festival&#x27;s achievements in the reviving of Rossini&#x27;s operas as entitled to be included among the state-supervised works of restoration of the national artistic heritage. The ensuing grant (of which parliament has recently approved the continuation) is financed from the funds of the &quot;Beni Culturali&quot;.

The Rossini Festival has seen many of Rossini&#x27;s lesser-known works revived, some of which have since entered the standard operatic repertoire.

From the beginning, the Festival attracted some major singers including Marilyn Horne, Montserrat Caballé, Ruggero Raimondi, Samuel Ramey and Juan Diego Flórez. Based on press reports, some productions have been extremely controversial.

<text>James Phillip Fleming (born March 12, 1943) is a former United States Air Force pilot who served in the Vietnam War. Born in Sedalia, Missouri, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing a six-man MACV-SOG reconnaissance team, stranded between heavily defended enemy positions, near Đức Cơ, Vietnam in 1968.

==Early life==
Born in March 12, 1943 in Sedalia, Missouri, Fleming entered military service at Pullman, Washington.

==Military career==
In 1968, Fleming was an aircraft commander of a UH-1F transport helicopter assigned to the 20th Special Operations Squadron at Ban Me Thuot East Airfield in the Republic of Vietnam. On November 26, a six-man reconnaissance team of Army Special Forces Green Berets had been lifted into Vietnam&#x27;s western highlands, near the Cambodian border and about west of Pleiku. Hours later, they found themselves penned up next to a river, with enemy forces on the three remaining sides. The team leader&#x27;s call for immediate evacuation was received by an Air Force forward air controller (FAC), Major Charles E. Anonsen, as well as Fleming&#x27;s nearby flight of five UH-1s. All five helicopters, despite being low on fuel, headed toward the coordinates while the FAC briefed them on the situation.

The Green Berets were taking heavy fire from six heavy machine guns and an undetermined number of enemy troops. As soon as the helicopters sighted the team&#x27;s smoke, the gunships opened fire, knocking out two machine gun positions. One gunship was hit and crash-landed across the river, its crew picked up by another of the transports. A second transport, low on fuel, had to pull out of formation and return to base. There were only two helicopters left, Fleming&#x27;s and one other that was almost out of ammunition.

Hovering just above the jungle treetops, Fleming inspected the only clearing near enough for the troops to reach and found it impossible to land there. He instead flew over the river and hovered just above the water, with his landing skids against the bank, hoping that the special forces troops would be able to run the few yards to his helicopter safely. In addition to exposing his aircraft to ground fire, this maneuver was a balancing act that required great piloting skill. After waiting for several minutes, the reconnaissance team radioed that they could not survive a dash to the helicopter. Fleming lifted his UH-1 out of range of the hostile fire.

The FAC directed the Green Berets to detonate their mines as Fleming made a last attempt to rescue them. As the mines exploded, he again lowered his helicopter to the river bank, balancing against it, giving the Green Berets an open cargo door through which to leap to safety. The enemy soldiers concentrated their fire on the UH-1. The Green Berets ran for the chopper, firing as they ran and killing three Viet Cong barely from the aircraft. As they leaped through the cargo door, Fleming once more backed the helicopter away from the bank and flew down the river to safety.

In a ceremony at the White House on May 14, 1970, President Richard Nixon presented the Medal of Honor to Fleming for his actions during the rescue. Fleming&#x27;s other decorations include the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross and eight Air Medals.

Fleming remained in the air force, becoming a colonel and a member of the Officer Training School staff at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, before his retirement in 1996.

<text>Wit is a form of intelligent humour—the ability to say or write things that are clever and typically funny. Someone witty is a person who is skilled at making clever and funny remarks. Forms of wit include the quip, repartee, and wisecrack.

==Forms==
As in the wit of Dorothy Parker&#x27;s set, the Algonquin Round Table, witty remarks may be intentionally cruel (as also in many &quot;epigrams&quot;), and perhaps more ingenious than funny.

A &quot;quip&quot; is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into sarcasm, or otherwise is short of a point. A &quot;witticism&quot; also suggests the diminutive.

&quot;Repartee&quot; is the wit of the quick answer and capping comment: the snappy comeback and neat retort.

Metaphysical poetry as a style was prevalent in the time of English playwright William Shakespeare, who admonished pretension with the phrase &quot;Better a witty fool than a foolish wit&quot;. It may combine word play with conceptual thinking, as a kind of verbal display requiring attention, without intending to be laugh-out-loud funny. Indeed wit in verse can be a thin disguise for more poignant feelings. English poet John Donne is a representative of this style.

==Other uses==

More generally, one&#x27;s &quot;wits&quot; are one&#x27;s intellectual powers of all types. &quot;Native wit&quot;—meaning the wits with which one is born—is closely synonymous with common sense. To &quot;live by one&#x27;s wits&quot; is to be an opportunist, but not always of the scrupulous kind. &quot;To have one&#x27;s wits about one&quot; is to be alert and capable of quick reasoning. To be at the end of one&#x27;s wits (&quot;I&#x27;m at wits&#x27; end&quot;) is to be immensely frustrated.

<doc id="380296" wikidata="Q1526" url="?curid=380296" title="Ramesses I">
<text>Menpehtyre Ramesses I (or Ramses) was the founding pharaoh of ancient Egypt&#x27;s 19th Dynasty. The dates for his short reign are not completely known but the timeline of late 1292–1290 BC is frequently cited as well as 1295–1294 BC. While Ramesses I was the founder of the 19th Dynasty, his brief reign mainly serves to mark the transition between the reign of Horemheb, who had stabilized Egypt in the late 18th Dynasty, and the rule of the powerful pharaohs of his own dynasty, in particular his son Seti I, and grandson Ramesses II.

==Origins==
Originally called Pa-ra-mes-su, Ramesses I was of non-royal birth, being born into a noble military family from the Nile Delta region, perhaps near the former Hyksos capital of Avaris. He was a son of a troop commander called Seti. His uncle Khaemwaset, an army officer, married Tamwadjesy, the matron of Tutankhamun&#x27;s Harem of Amun, who was a relative of Huy, the viceroy of Kush, an important state post. This shows the high status of Ramesses&#x27; family. Ramesses I found favor with Horemheb, the last pharaoh of the tumultuous Eighteenth Dynasty, who appointed the former as his vizier. Ramesses also served as the High Priest of Set—as such, he would have played an important role in the restoration of the old religion following the Amarna heresy of a generation earlier, under Akhenaten.

Horemheb himself had been a nobleman from outside the immediate royal family, who rose through the ranks of the Egyptian army to serve as the royal advisor to Tutankhamun and Ay and, ultimately, pharaoh. Since Horemheb had no surviving children, he ultimately chose Ramesses to be his heir in the final years of his reign presumably because Ramesses I was both an able administrator and had a son (Seti I) and a grandson (the future Ramesses II) to succeed him and thus avoid any succession difficulties.

==Reign==

Upon his accession, Ramesses assumed a prenomen, or royal name. When transliterated, the name is &quot;mn-pḥty-rʿ&quot;, which is usually interpreted as Menpehtyre, meaning &quot;Established by the strength of Ra&quot;. However, he is better known by his nomen, or personal name. This is transliterated as &quot;rʿ-ms-sw&quot;, and is usually realised as Ramessu or Ramesses, meaning &#x27;Ra bore him&#x27;. Already an old man when he was crowned, Ramesses appointed his son, the later pharaoh Seti I, to serve as the Crown Prince and chosen successor. Seti was charged with undertaking several military operations during this time—in particular, an attempt to recoup some of Egypt&#x27;s lost possessions in Syria. Ramesses appears to have taken charge of domestic matters: most memorably, he completed the second pylon at Karnak Temple, begun under Horemheb.

Ramesses I reigned briefly, as evidenced by the lack of contemporary monuments mentioning him: the king had little time to build any major buildings in his reign and was hurriedly buried in a small and hastily finished tomb. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, in his book Contra Apionem which translated Manetho&#x27;s Aegyptiaca, Manetho assigns this king a reign of 16 months, but this pharaoh certainly ruled Egypt for a minimum of 17 months based on his highest-known date which is a Year 2 II Peret day 20 (Louvre C57) stela which ordered the provision of new endowments of food and priests for the temple of Ptah within the Egyptian fortress of Buhen. In contrast, Ramesses I&#x27;s son and successor, Seti I, assumed the throne five months later after the erection of this stela on III Shemu day 24 which means that Ramesses I had a minimum reign of 17 months (or one year and five months). However, based on a papyrus document published by Robert J. Demarée in a 2023 publication, Demarée argues that Ramesses I&#x27;s predecessor, Horemheb, died on III Shemu 22 based on evidence in Papyrus Turin Cat. 1898 + Cat. 1937 + Cat. 2094/244, which is a journal diary. If confirmed, this would mean that Ramesses I actually had a reign of approximately two full years since he would have ascended to the throne around III Shemu 23 soon after Horemheb&#x27;s death on III Shemu 22 and died about two years later around the very same day since Ramesses I&#x27;s son, Seti I, succeeded his father on III Shemu 24.

Ramesses I&#x27;s only known action was to order the provision of endowments for the aforementioned Nubian temple at Buhen and &quot;the construction of a chapel and a temple (which was to be finished by his son) at Abydos.&quot;

==Death==
Ramesses was buried in the Valley of the Kings. His tomb, discovered by Giovanni Belzoni in 1817 and designated KV16, is small in size and gives the impression of having been completed with haste. Joyce Tyldesley states that Ramesses I&#x27;s tomb consisted of a single corridor and one unfinished room whose walls, after a hurried coat of plaster, were painted to show the king with his gods, with Osiris allowed a prominent position. The red granite sarcophagus too was painted rather than carved with inscriptions which, due to their hasty preparation, included a number of unfortunate errors.

Seti I, his son and successor, later built a small chapel with fine reliefs in memory of his deceased father Ramesses I at Abydos. In 1911, John Pierpont Morgan donated several exquisite reliefs from this chapel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

===Rediscovery and repatriation===

A mummy currently believed to be that of Ramesses I was displayed in a private Canadian museum for many years before being repatriated. The mummy&#x27;s identity cannot be conclusively determined, but is most likely to be that of Ramesses I based on CT scans, X-rays, skull measurements and radio-carbon dating tests by researchers at Emory University, as well as aesthetic interpretations of family resemblance. Moreover, the mummy&#x27;s arms were found crossed high across his chest which was a position reserved solely for Egyptian royalty until 600 BC.

The mummy had been stolen from the Royal Cache in Deir el-Bahari by the Abd el-Rassul family of grave robbers and sold by Turkish vice-consular agent Mustapha Aga Ayat at Luxor to Dr. James Douglas who brought it to North America around 1860. Douglas used to purchase Egyptian antiquities for his friend Sydney Barnett who then placed it in the Niagara Falls Museum. At the time, the identity of the mummified man was unknown. The mummy remained in the museum through moves to Niagara Falls, New York and Niagara Falls, Ontario next to other curiosities for more than 130 years. The mummy was displayed as a &quot;A Prince of Egypt&quot; but despite occasional speculation from visitors that he might be exactly that nothing further was done.

When the owner of the museum decided to sell his property, Canadian businessman William Jamieson purchased the contents of the museum and, with the help of Canadian egyptologist Gayle Gibson, identified their great value. In 1999, Jamieson sold the Egyptian artifacts in the collection, including the various mummies, to the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia for US$2 million. The mummy was returned to Egypt on October 24, 2003, with full official honors and is on display at the Luxor Museum.

<doc id="380299" wikidata="Q340307" url="?curid=380299" title="Ankle jerk reflex">
<text>The ankle jerk reflex, also known as the Achilles reflex, occurs when the Achilles tendon is tapped while the foot is dorsiflexed. 
It is a type of stretch reflex that tests the function of the gastrocnemius muscle and the nerve that supplies it.
A positive result would be the jerking of the foot towards its plantar surface. Being a deep tendon reflex, it is monosynaptic. It is also a stretch reflex. 
These are monosynaptic spinal segmental reflexes. When they are intact, integrity of the following is confirmed: cutaneous innervation, motor supply, and cortical input to the corresponding spinal segment.

==Root value==
This reflex is mediated by the S1 spinal segment of the spinal cord.

==Procedure and components==
Ankle of the patient is relaxed. It is helpful to support the ball of the foot at least somewhat to put some tension in the Achilles tendon, but don’t completely dorsiflex the ankle. A small strike is given on the Achilles tendon using a rubber hammer to elicit the response. If the practitioner is not able to elicit a response, a Jendrassik maneuver can be tried by having the patient cup their fingers on each hand and try to pull the hands apart. A positive response is marked by a brisk plantarflexion of the foot. The response is also graded into Grade 0-4 according to the reflex grading system.

==Absent ankle jerk==

The Achilles reflex checks if the S1 and S2 nerve roots are intact and could be indicative of sciatic nerve pathology. It is classically delayed in hypothyroidism. This reflex is usually absent in disk herniations at the L5—S1 level. A reduction in the ankle jerk reflex may also be indicative of peripheral neuropathy.

===Common causes===
*Lumbar herniated disk syndrome
*Lumbar spinal stenosis
*Endocrine disorders
**Hypothyroidism
*Sciatic neuropathy
*Lumbosacral plexus disorder
*Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
*Cauda equina syndrome
*Lumbar radiculopathy
*Holmes-Adie syndrome
*Idiopathic
*Trauma
**Concussion, spinal cord
*Hypothermia
*Infectious diseases
**Tabes dorsalis
**Poliomyelitis, acute
**Lumbar disk infection/pyogenic
**Arachnoiditis lumbosacral
*Neoplastic disorders
**Primary
**Secondary
*Allergic, collagen, autoimmune diseases
*Diabetic neuropathy

===Rarer causes===
*Abetalipoproteinemia
*Electrolyte abnormalities
**Hypokalemia
*Deficiency disorders
**Vitamin E deficiency
*Congenital developmental disorders
**Spina bifida
*Genetic disorders
**Hypokalemic periodic paralysis
**Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease
**Spinal muscular atrophy
**Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia
*Drugs
**Tubocurarine
**Pyridoxine excess/megadose
**Chronic alcoholism

==Ankle clonus==
Grade 4 ankle hyperreflexia is called ankle clonus. There is repetitive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion on passive dorsiflexion of the foot by the examiner till the force applied by the examiner is withdrawn.

===Causes===
Any spinal cord lesions, be it traumatic, neoplastic, pyogenic, vascular above the level of S1 can cause clonus. This is because of the spasticity caused by the UMN type of injury causing hyperreflexia and clonus. Some other causes of clonus are
*Meningitis
*Tetanus
*CJD
*Cerebral palsy
*Multiple sclerosis
*Syringomyelia
*Pre-eclampsia

<doc id="380304" wikidata="Q282301" url="?curid=380304" title="Demonstrative">
<text>Demonstratives (abbreviated ) are words, such as &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot;, used to indicate which entities are being referred to and to distinguish those entities from others. They are typically deictic, their meaning depending on a particular frame of reference, and cannot be understood without context. Demonstratives are often used in spatial deixis (where the speaker or sometimes the listener is to provide context), but also in intra-discourse reference (including abstract concepts) or anaphora, where the meaning is dependent on something other than the relative physical location of the speaker. An example is whether something is currently being said or was said earlier.

Demonstrative constructions include demonstrative adjectives or demonstrative determiners, which qualify nouns (as in &quot;Put that coat on&quot;) and demonstrative pronouns, which stand independently (as in &quot;Put that on&quot;). The demonstratives in English are &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, &quot;these&quot;, &quot;those&quot;, and the archaic &quot;yon&quot;, &quot;yons&quot;, and &quot;yonder&quot;, along with &quot;this one&quot; or &quot;that one&quot; as substitutes for the pronoun use of &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;.

==Contrasts in demonstrative systems==
===Distal and proximal demonstratives===

Many languages, such as English and Standard Chinese, make a two-way distinction between demonstratives. Typically, one set of demonstratives is proximal, indicating objects close to the speaker (English &quot;this&quot;), and the other series is distal, indicating objects further removed from the speaker (English &quot;that&quot;).

Other languages, like Finnish, Nandi, Hawaiian, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian (in some formal writing), Armenian, Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, Georgian, Basque, Korean, Japanese, Ukrainian, Bengali, and Sri Lankan Tamil make a three-way distinction. Typically there is a distinction between proximal or first person (objects near to the speaker), medial or second person (objects near to the addressee), and distal or third person (objects far from both). So for example, in Portuguese:
:* &quot;Esta maçã&quot;
: &quot;this apple&quot;
:* &quot;Essa maçã&quot;
: &quot;that apple (near you)&quot;
:* &quot;Aquela maçã&quot;
: &quot;that apple (over there, away from both of us)&quot;

Further oppositions are created with place adverbs.
:* &quot;Essa maçã aqui&quot;
: &quot;this apple (next to me or next to you-and-me)&quot;
:* &quot;Essa maçã aí&quot;
: &quot;that apple (next to you)&quot;
:* &quot;Aquela maçã ali&quot;
: &quot;that apple (close to you-and-me)&quot;
:* &quot;Aquela maçã lá&quot;
: &quot;that apple (which is far from you-and-me or is in another distant place from you-and-me)&quot;

in Italian (medial pronouns, in most of Italy, only survive in historical texts and bureaucratic texts. However, they&#x27;re of wide and very common usage in some Regions, like Tuscany):
:* &quot;Questa mela&quot;
: &quot;this apple&quot;
:* &quot;Codesta mela&quot;
: &quot;that apple (near you)&quot;
:* &quot;Quella mela&quot;
: &quot;yon apple (over there, away from both of us)&quot;

in Hawaiian:
:* &quot;Kēia ʻukulele&quot;
: &quot;this ukulele&quot;
:* &quot;kēnā ʻukulele&quot;
: &quot;that ukulele (near you)&quot;
:* &quot;kēlā ʻukulele&quot;
: &quot;yon ukulele (over there, away from both of us)&quot;

in Armenian (based on the proximal &quot;s&quot;, medial &quot;d/t&quot;, and distal &quot;n&quot;):


and, in Georgian:


and, in Ukrainian (note that Ukrainian has not only number, but also three grammatical genders in singular):
:* цей чоловік, ця жінка, це яблуко, ці яблука
: &quot;this man&quot;, &quot;this woman&quot;, &quot;this apple&quot;, &quot;these apples&quot;
:* той чоловік, та жінка, те яблуко, ті яблука
: &quot;that man&quot;, &quot;that woman&quot;, &quot;that apple&quot;, &quot;those apples&quot;
:* он той чоловік, он та жінка, он те яблуко, он ті яблука
: &quot;yon man (over there, away from both of us)&quot;, &quot;that woman (over there, away from both of us)&quot;, &quot;yon apple (over there, away from both of us)&quot;, &quot;yons apples (over there, away from both of us)&quot;

and, in Japanese:


In Nandi (Kalenjin of Kenya, Uganda and Eastern Congo):

&quot;Chego chu, Chego choo, Chego chuun&quot;

&quot;this milk&quot;, &quot;that milk&quot; (near the second person) and &quot;that milk&quot; (away from the first and second person, near a third person or even further away).

Ancient Greek has a three-way distinction between (&quot;hóde&quot; &quot;this here&quot;), (&quot;hoûtos&quot; &quot;this&quot;), and (&quot;ekeînos&quot; &quot;that&quot;).

Spanish, Tamil and Seri also make this distinction. French has a two-way distinction, with the use of postpositions &quot;-ci&quot; (proximal) and &quot;-là&quot; (distal) as in &quot;cet homme-ci&quot; and &quot;cet homme-là&quot;, as well as the pronouns &quot;ce&quot; and &quot;cela&quot;/&quot;ça&quot;. English has an archaic but occasionally used three-way distinction of &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, and &quot;yonder&quot;.

Arabic has also a three-way distinction in its formal Classical and Modern Standard varieties. Very rich, with more than 70 variants, the demonstrative pronouns in Arabic principally change depending on the gender and the number. They mark a distinction in number for singular, dual, and plural. For example:
:* (&quot;haːðaː arrajul&quot;) &#x27;this man&#x27;.
:* (&quot;ðaːka arrajul&quot;) &#x27;that man&#x27;.
:* (&quot;ðaːlika arrajul&quot;) &#x27;that man&#x27; (over there).

In Modern German (and the Scandinavian languages), the non-selective deictic das Kind&quot;, der Kleine&quot;, die Kleine&quot; and the selective one das Kind&quot;, der Kleine&quot;, die Kleine&quot; are homographs, but they are spoken differently. The non-selective deictics are unstressed whereas the selective ones (demonstratives) are stressed. There is a second selective deictic, namely dieses Kind&quot;, dieser Kleine&quot;, &quot;diese Kleine&quot;. Distance either from the speaker or from the addressee is either marked by the opposition between these two deictics or by the addition of a place deictic.

Distance-marking Thing Demonstrative
: &quot;dieses Mädchen&quot; ~ &quot;das Mädchen&quot;
: &quot;this girl&quot; ~ &quot;that girl&quot;

Thing Demonstrative plus Distance-marking Place Demonstrative
: &quot;das Mädchen hier&quot; ~ &quot;das Mädchen da&quot;
: &quot;dieses Mädchen hier&quot; ~ &quot;dieses Mädchen da&quot;
: &quot;this girl here&quot; ~ &quot;that girl over there&quot;

A distal demonstrative exists in German, cognate to the English &quot;yonder&quot;, but it is used only in formal registers.
: &quot;jenes Mädchen&quot;
: &quot;yonder girl&quot;

Cognates of &quot;yonder&quot; still exist in some Northern English and Scots dialects;

:&quot;This shop here&quot;

:&quot;That shop across the street&quot;

:&quot;Yon shop down the street&quot;
:(that shop that is/used to be down the street)

There are languages which make a four-way distinction, such as Northern Sami:
:* &quot;Dát biila&quot;
: &quot;this car&quot;
:* &quot;Diet biila&quot;
: &quot;that car (near you)&quot;
:* &quot;Duot biila&quot;
: &quot;that car (over there, away from both of us but rather near)&quot;
:* &quot;Dot biila&quot;
: &quot;that car (over there, far away)&quot;
These four-way distinctions are often termed proximal, mesioproximal, mesiodistal, and distal.

=== Non-distal contrasts ===
Many non-European languages make further distinctions; for example, whether the object referred to is uphill or downhill from the speaker, whether the object is visible or not (as in Malagasy), and whether the object can be pointed to as a whole or only in part. The Eskimo–Aleut languages, and the Kiranti branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family are particularly well known for their many contrasts.

The demonstratives in Seri are compound forms based on the definite articles (themselves derived from verbs) and therefore incorporate the positional information of the articles (standing, sitting, lying, coming, going) in addition to the three-way spatial distinction. This results in a quite elaborated set of demonstratives.

==Demonstrative series in other languages==
Latin had several sets of demonstratives, including &quot;hic&quot;, &quot;haec&quot;, &quot;hoc&quot; (&quot;this near me&quot;); &quot;iste&quot;, &quot;ista&quot;, &quot;istud&quot; (&quot;that near you&quot;); and &quot;ille&quot;, &quot;illa&quot;, &quot;illud&quot; (&quot;that over there&quot;) – note that Latin has not only number, but also three grammatical genders. The third set of Latin demonstratives (&quot;ille&quot;, etc.), developed into the definite articles in most Romance languages, such as &quot;el&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;los&quot;, &quot;las&quot; in Spanish, and &quot;le&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;les&quot; in French.

With the exception of Romanian, and some varieties of Spanish and Portuguese, the neuter gender has been lost in the Romance languages. Spanish and Portuguese have kept neuter demonstratives:

Some forms of Spanish (Caribbean Spanish, Andalusian Spanish, etc.) also occasionally employ &quot;ello&quot;, which is an archaic survival of the neuter pronoun from Latin &quot;illud&quot;.

Neuter demonstratives refer to ideas of indeterminate gender, such as abstractions and groups of heterogeneous objects, and has a limited agreement in Portuguese, for example, &quot;all of that&quot; can be translated as &quot;todo aquele&quot; (m), &quot;toda aquela&quot; (f) or &quot;tudo aquilo&quot; (n) in Portuguese, although the neuter forms require a masculine adjective agreement: &quot;Tudo (n) aquilo (n) está quebrado (m)&quot; (&quot;All of that is broken&quot;).

Classical Chinese had three main demonstrative pronouns: proximal (this), distal (that), and distance-neutral (this or that). The frequent use of as a resumptive demonstrative pronoun that reasserted the subject before a noun predicate caused it to develop into its colloquial use as a copula by the Han period and subsequently its standard use as a copula in Modern Standard Chinese. Modern Mandarin has two main demonstratives, proximal / and distal ; its use of the three Classical demonstratives has become mostly idiomatic, although continues to be used with some frequency in modern written Chinese. Cantonese uses proximal and distal instead of and , respectively.

Similarly, Northern Wu languages tend to also have a distance-neutral demonstrative , which is etymologically a checked-tone derivation of . In lects such as Shanghainese, distance-based demonstratives exist, but are only used constrastively. Suzhounese, on the other hand, has several demonstratives that form a two-way contrast, but also have , which is neutral.

Hungarian has two spatial demonstratives: &quot;ez&quot; (this) and &quot;az&quot; (that). These inflect for number and case even in attributive position (attributes usually remain uninflected in Hungarian) with possible orthographic changes; e.g., &quot;ezzel&quot; (with this), &quot;abban&quot; (in that). A third degree of deixis is also possible in Hungarian, with the help of the &quot;am-&quot; prefix: &quot;amaz&quot; (that there). The use of this, however, is emphatic (when the speaker wishes to emphasize the distance) and not mandatory.

The Cree language has a special demonstrative for &quot;things just gone out of sight,&quot; and Ilocano, a language of the Philippines, has three words for &quot;this&quot; referring to a visible object, a fourth for things not in view and a fifth for things that no longer exist.&quot; The Tiriyó language has a demonstrative for &quot;things audible but non-visible&quot;

While most languages and language families have demonstrative systems, some have systems highly divergent from or more complex than the relatively simple systems employed in Indo-European languages. In Yupik languages, notably in the Chevak Cup’ik language, there exists a 29-way distinction in demonstratives, with demonstrative indicators distinguished according to placement in a three-dimensional field around the interlocutor(s), as well as by visibility and whether or not the object is in motion.

==Demonstrative determiners and pronouns==
It is relatively common for a language to distinguish between demonstrative determiners or demonstrative adjectives (sometimes also called &quot;determinative demonstratives&quot;, &quot;adjectival demonstratives&quot; or &quot;adjectival demonstrative pronouns&quot;) and demonstrative pronouns (sometimes called &quot;independent demonstratives&quot;, &quot;substantival demonstratives&quot;, &quot;independent demonstrative pronouns&quot; or &quot;substantival demonstrative pronouns&quot;).

A demonstrative determiner modifies a noun:

:&quot;This apple is good.&quot;
:&quot;I like those houses.&quot;

A demonstrative pronoun stands on its own, replacing rather than modifying a noun:

:&quot;This is good.&quot;
:&quot;I like those.&quot;

There are six common demonstrative pronouns in English: &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, &quot;these&quot;, &quot;those&quot;, &quot;none&quot;, and &quot;neither.&quot; Some dialects, such as Southern American English, also use &quot;yon&quot; and &quot;yonder&quot;, where the latter is usually employed as a demonstrative determiner. Author Bill Bryson laments the &quot;losses along the way&quot; of &quot;yon&quot; and &quot;yonder&quot;:

==Demonstrative adverbs==
Many languages have sets of demonstrative adverbs that are closely related to the demonstrative pronouns in a language. For example, corresponding to the demonstrative pronoun &quot;that&quot; are the adverbs such as &quot;then&quot; (= &quot;at that time&quot;), &quot;there&quot; (= &quot;at that place&quot;), &quot;thither&quot; (= &quot;to that place&quot;), &quot;thence&quot; (= &quot;from that place&quot;); equivalent adverbs corresponding to the demonstrative pronoun &quot;this&quot; are &quot;now&quot;, &quot;here&quot;, &quot;hither&quot;, &quot;hence&quot;. A similar relationship exists between the interrogative pronoun &quot;what&quot; and the interrogative adverbs &quot;when&quot;, &quot;where&quot;, &quot;whither&quot;, &quot;whence&quot;. See pro-form for a full table.

==Discourse deixis==

As mentioned above, while the primary function of demonstratives is to provide spatial references of concrete objects (&quot;that (building)&quot;, &quot;this (table)&quot;), there is a secondary function: referring to items of discourse. For example:

:&quot;This sentence is short.&quot;
:&quot;This is what I mean: I am happy with him.&quot;
:&quot;That way of looking at it is wrong.&quot;
:&quot;I said her dress looked hideous. She didn&#x27;t like that.&quot;

In the above, &quot;this sentence&quot; refers to the sentence being spoken, and the pronoun &quot;this&quot; refers to what is about to be spoken; &quot;that way&quot; refers to &quot;the previously mentioned way&quot;, and the pronoun &quot;that&quot; refers to the content of the previous statement. These are abstract entities of discourse, not concrete objects. Each language may have subtly different rules on how to use demonstratives to refer to things previously spoken, currently being spoken, or about to be spoken. In English, &quot;that&quot; (or occasionally &quot;those&quot;) refers to something previously spoken, while &quot;this&quot; (or occasionally &quot;these&quot;) refers to something about to be spoken (or, occasionally, something being simultaneously spoken).

<doc id="380308" wikidata="Q734547" url="?curid=380308" title="North London">
<text>North London is the northern part of London, England, north of the River Thames. It extends from Clerkenwell and Finsbury, on the edge of the City of London financial district, to Greater London&#x27;s boundary with Hertfordshire.

The term is used to differentiate the area from South London, East London and West London. Some parts of north London are also part of Central London. There is a Northern postal area, but this includes some areas not normally described as part of north London, while excluding many others that are.

==Development==
The first northern suburb developed in the Soke of Cripplegate in the early part of the twelfth century, but London&#x27;s growth beyond its Roman northern gates was slower than in other directions, partly because of the marshy ground north of the wall and also because the roads through those gates were less well-connected than elsewhere. The parishes that would become north London were almost entirely rural until the Victorian period. Many of these parishes were grouped into an area called the Finsbury division of Middlesex.

In the early part of the 19th century, the arrival of Regent&#x27;s Canal in Islington and St Pancras stimulated London&#x27;s northerly expansion, continuing when the development of the railway network accelerated urbanisation, promoting economic growth in the capital and allowing for the establishment of commuter suburbs.

This trend continued in the twentieth century and was reinforced by motorcar-based commuting until the establishment—shortly after the Second World War—of the Metropolitan Green Belt, which prevented urban London from expanding any further.

The 2011 London Plan included a North sub-region, to be used for planning, engagement, resource allocation and progress reporting purposes. It consisted of the London Boroughs of Barnet, Haringey and Enfield. 
The 2004-2008 and 2008-2011 London Plan sub-regions varied in their composition.

===North Thames: Boundary Commission report===
In 2017, the government asked the Boundary Commission for England to reconsider the boundaries of parliamentary constituencies. The Commission&#x27;s approach was to start with existing regions of England (in this case London) and then group the local authorities within that area into sub-regions for further sub-division.

The North Thames sub-region includes all parts of London lying north of the river; the 19 boroughs which lie wholly north of the river, plus parts of cross-river Richmond upon Thames.

An earlier 2013 study, whose recommendations were not adopted, took a different approach by assigning all of Richmond to the south.
This list includes all boroughs included in the North Thames area:

===Football: North London Derby===

Football in the region is dominated by Premier League teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. The two clubs contest the North London derby, which has been described as &quot;one of the fiercest derbies in English football and one that separates families in north London.&quot;

The games in the Premier League (and formerly the Football League) are known formally as &quot;the&quot; North London derby. To date, 167 matches have been played with 66 wins for Arsenal, 54 wins for Spurs and 47 draws. In other matches, simply referred to generically as North London derbies, the 6 FA Cup contests resulted in 4 Arsenal victories to Spurs&#x27; 2 with no draws, while the 14 League Cup matches have ended with 7 wins for Arsenal against 4 for Spurs with 3 draws.

In the sole Charity Shield between the two clubs, then exclusively between the previous season&#x27;s league champions and the FA Cup winners, the contest in 1991 was drawn with the Shield shared. Spurs had won the FA cup final in 1991 after beating Arsenal 3–1 in the semi-final, the first FA cup semi-final and the first of five North London derbies to be held at Wembley Stadium. The 1991 Charity Shield is the sole occasion so far in which a trophy has been at stake, though in 1971 (0–1) and 2004 (2–2) Arsenal were crowned league champions at the final whistle of the North London derby in Tottenham.

==Climate==

North London has, like other parts of London and the UK in general, a temperate maritime climate according to the Köppen climate classification system. Long term climate observations dating back to 1910 are available for Hampstead, which is also the most elevated Weather Station in the London area, at 137m. This both hilltop and urban position means severe frosts are rare.

Temperatures increase towards the Thames, firstly because of the urban warming effect of the surrounding area, but secondly due to altitude decreasing towards the river, meaning some of the hillier northern margins of North London are often a degree or so cooler than those areas adjacent to the Thames. Occasionally snow can be seen to lie towards the Chilterns while central London is snow-free.

Typically the warmest day of the year at Hampstead will average with around 14 days in total achieving a value of or higher.

The average coldest night should fall to . On average 35.8 nights will report an air frost, some 119 days of the year will register at least 1mm of precipitation, and on 7.4 days a cover of snow will be observed. All annual averages refer to the observation period 1971–2000.

<doc id="380312" wikidata="Q45636" url="?curid=380312" title="Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic">
<text>The State Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was the national anthem of Armenia when it was a republic of the Soviet Union and known as the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was used between 1944 and 1991. Its music was composed by Armenian composer Aram Khachaturian, and the lyrics were written by Sarmen. Along with the Anthem of the Estonian SSR, it is one of the only two SSR anthems without an intro.

Upon independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the newly independent Armenia adopted its previous anthem &quot;Mer Hayreniq&quot; in its place, though there has been occasional debate about restoring the music of the anthem of the Armenian SSR with different lyrics as the national anthem.
==Lyrics==
=== Post-Stalinist version ===

=== Original version ===

==Restoration attempts==
The anthem has always maintained simultaneous public support and displeasure in Armenia. There have been attempts to restore the anthem&#x27;s melody with new lyrics as the new national anthem of Armenia, similar to the case with the national anthem of Russia in 2000 during the early years of the presidency of Vladimir Putin. Some Armenian composers and artists have long disliked the uncomplicated theme of the current national anthem &quot;Mer Hayreniq&quot;, and have expressed a desire for a more solemn tune, while others have stated that singing &quot;Mer Hayrenik&quot; itself has carried too much sorrow throughout the 20th and 21st centuries and that a more joyous alternative should be chosen. In 2019, National Assembly vice-speaker Alen Simonyan claimed that most Armenians do not like the current anthem. Eurasianet reported in 2019 that the current anthem remains unpopular with many Armenians, mainly for aesthetic reasons.

In 2005, the issue of changing the national anthem was discussed in government, which culminated in a constitutional referendum on adopting new state symbols within one year (by 6 December 2006). In early 2006, a competition for a new anthem was held by Minister of Culture Hasmik Poghosyan. The competition received 85 entries, and in August the commission shortlisted five, which did not include &quot;Mer Hayrenik&quot; but included a proposal with the music of the anthem of the Armenian SSR and lyrics by Armen Soghomonyan. This proposal won the competition, but the commission members rejected the submitted lyrics, urging local authors to submit better ones. While several Armenian music and arts figures were indifferent to or supportive of the change to the music, the results of the competition were eventually scrapped in October, after strong opposition from the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (or &quot;Dashnaks&quot;), then a member of the ruling coalition, throughout over the selection of a Soviet-era song. The government instead adopted a draft law that would keep &quot;Mer Hayreniq&quot; as the anthem for at least one more year. The adoption of the law was after the 6 December 2006 date set late the year prior as the constitutional deadline for reaffirming the existing state symbol.

In 2012, actor Sos Sargsyan, writer Levon Ananyan and publicist Zori Balayan sent an open letter with 2,208 signatures to the president petitioning to restore the Soviet-era coat of arms designed by painter Martiros Saryan and the anthem composed by Aram Khachaturyan. Ananyan stated, &quot;... this is an issue that’s always important and has to always be raised, it’s the face of our country, our symbols that have to be representative and impressive.&quot; Political historian Shushan Khatlamajyan, the widow of the painter who restored Armenia&#x27;s current coat of arms, opposed the restoration of the anthem, stating that people were trying to return &quot;symbols of a period when they had a good life&quot; and attributed Russia&#x27;s Soviet-era anthem restoration to &quot;pro-empire aspirations&quot;, stating, &quot;... what do we want to achieve by trying to bring back fragments from our past?&quot; while director of the Martin Saryan House-Museum Ruzan Saryan, Martin&#x27;s granddaughter, supported it, stating, &quot;... viewing the masterpieces by Saryan and Khachaturyan through the prism of ‘totalitarian past’ is medieval prejudice.”

In 2015, Chairman of the Composers&#x27; Union of Armenia Aram Satyan criticised the current Armenian anthem&#x27;s sad impression and stated that the tone of the music should rise and become upbeat in the process. He stated, &quot;In the case of other nations’ anthems we see some grandeur as it rises to the space, and ours on the contrary is directed to the earth… We can restore Aram Khachaturian’s music or use the Hayastan song composed by Gabriel Yeranyan in 2012.&quot;

In 2018, the House-Museum of Aram Khachaturian proposed for the national anthem to be changed to one based on the music of that of the Armenian SSR, composed by Khachaturian. This petition was not supported at the time in Armenia, which was dealing with the 2018 Armenian protests and revolution.

In 2019, another suggestion to adopt a national anthem based on the music of the anthem of the Armenian SSR was put forward by vice-speaker of the National Assembly Alen Simonyan. In a Facebook post, he stated that it is &quot;a powerful anthem that meets all the requirements.&quot; His comment received support from composer Ara Gevorgyan, who replied, &quot;It is a great hymn and we look forward to the decision to restore it.&quot; Simonyan subsequently created a Facebook poll, in which two-thirds of more than 6,500 respondents voted in favour of the change. Minister of Diaspora Babken Ter-Grigoryan responded by stating that he would survey the Armenian diaspora on the potential change. With Armenia&#x27;s new parliament under Nikol Pashinyan seated just three weeks prior, many among the Armenian public responded by saying it was not a pressing issue at the time. A member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation again expressed strong opposition to the idea.

<doc id="380313" wikidata="Q501405" url="?curid=380313" title="Future tense">
<text>In grammar, a future tense (abbreviated ) is a verb form that generally marks the event described by the verb as not having happened yet, but expected to happen in the future. An example of a future tense form is the French &quot;achètera&quot;, meaning &quot;will buy&quot;, derived from the verb &quot;acheter&quot; (&quot;to buy&quot;). The &quot;future&quot; expressed by the future tense usually means the future relative to the moment of speaking, although in contexts where relative tense is used it may mean the future relative to some other point in time under consideration.

English does not have an inflectional future tense, though it has a variety of grammatical and lexical means for expressing future-related meanings. These include modal auxiliaries such as &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; as well as the futurate present tense.

==Expressions==
The nature of the future, necessarily uncertain and at varying distances ahead, means that the speaker may refer to future events with the modality either of probability (what the speaker expects to happen) or intent (what the speaker plans to make happen). Whether future expression is realis or irrealis depends not so much on an objective ontological notion of future reality, but rather on the degree of the speaker&#x27;s conviction that the event will in fact come about.

In many languages there is no grammatical (morphological or syntactic) indication of future tense. Future meaning is supplied by the context, with the use of temporal adverbs such as &quot;later&quot;, &quot;next year&quot;, etc. Such adverbs (in particular words meaning &quot;tomorrow&quot; and &quot;then&quot;) sometimes develop into grammaticalized future tense markers. (A tense used to refer specifically to occurrences taking place on the following day is called a crastinal tense.)

In other languages, mostly of European origin, specific markers indicate futurity. These structures constitute a &quot;future tense&quot;. In many cases, an auxiliary verb is used, as in English, where futurity is often indicated by the modal auxiliary &quot;will&quot; (or &quot;shall&quot;). However, some languages combine such an auxiliary with the main verb to produce a simple (one-word, morphological) future tense. This is the origin of the future tense in Western Romance languages such as French and Italian (see below).

A given language may have more than one way to express futurity. English, for example, often refers to future events using present tense forms or other structures such as the &quot;going-to&quot; future, besides the canonical form with &quot;will/shall&quot;. In addition, the verb forms used for the future tense can also be used to express other types of meaning; English again provides examples of this (see English modal verbs for the various meanings that both &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; can have besides simply expressing futurity).

== Germanic languages ==
In Germanic languages, including English, a common expression of the future is using the present tense, with the futurity expressed using words that imply future action (&quot;I go to Berlin &quot;tomorrow&quot; or &quot;I am going to Berlin &quot;tomorrow&quot;). There is no simple (morphological) future tense as such. However, the future can also be expressed by employing an auxiliary construction that combines certain present tense auxiliary verbs with the simple infinitive (stem) of the main verb. These auxiliary forms vary between the languages. Other, generally more informal, expressions of futurity use an auxiliary with the compound infinitive of the main verb (as with the English &quot;is going to ...&quot;).

===English===
English grammar provides a number of ways to indicate the future nature of an occurrence. Some argue that English, like most Germanic languages, does not have a future tense—that is, a grammatical form that always indicates futurity—nor does it have a mandatory form for the expression of futurity. However, through gradual development from its Germanic roots, English became what is now considered a strongly future-tense-marking language. Currently, there are several generally accepted ways to indicate futurity in English, and some of them—particularly those that use &quot;will&quot; or &quot;shall&quot; as the most universal and widely used—are frequently described as future tense while some may argue these verbs serve both as present modal verbs and future tense markers.

The &quot;will/shall&quot; future consists of the modal verb &quot;will&quot; or &quot;shall&quot; together with the bare infinitive of the main verb, as in &quot;He will win&quot; or &quot;I shall win&quot;. (Prescriptive grammarians prefer &quot;will&quot; in the second and third persons and &quot;shall&quot; in the first person, reversing the forms to express obligation or determination, but in practice &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; are generally used interchangeably, with &quot;will&quot; being more common. For details see &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot;.) The meaning of this construction is close to that expressed by the future tense in other languages. However the same construction with &quot;will&quot; or &quot;shall&quot; can have other meanings that do not indicate futurity, or else indicate some modality in addition to futurity (as in &quot;He will make rude remarks,&quot; in the sense of &quot;He is wont to make rude remarks,&quot; meaning he has a habit of doing so; or, &quot;You shall stop making rude remarks,&quot; which is giving an order). For details of these meanings, see the sections on &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; in the article on English modal verbs.

The form of the &quot;will/shall&quot; future described above is frequently called the &quot;simple future&quot; (or &quot;future simple&quot;). Other constructions provide additional auxiliaries that express particular aspects: the &quot;future progressive&quot; (or &quot;future continuous&quot;) as in &quot;He will be working&quot;; the &quot;future perfect&quot; as in &quot;They will have finished&quot;; and the &quot;future perfect progressive&quot; as in &quot;You will have been practising.&quot; For detail on these, see the relevant sections of Uses of English verb forms. (For more on expressions of relative tense, such as the future perfect, see also the section above.)

Several other English constructions commonly refer to the future:
* Futurate present tense forms, as in &quot;The trains leave at five&quot; (meaning &quot;The trains &quot;will&quot; leave at five&quot;), or &quot;My cousins arrive tomorrow&quot; (meaning &quot;My cousins &quot;will&quot; arrive tomorrow&quot;). Since these grammatical forms are used more canonically to refer to present situations, they are not generally described as future tense; in sentences like those just given they may be described as &quot;present tense with future meaning&quot;. Use of the present tense (rather than forms with &quot;will&quot;) is mandatory in some subordinate clauses referring to the future, such as &quot;If I feel better next week, ...&quot; and &quot;As soon as they arrive, ...&quot;. For more details see the sections on the simple present, present progressive and dependent clauses in the article on English verb forms.
* The &quot;going-to&quot; future, e.g., &quot;John is going to leave tonight.&quot;
* The construction with a finite form of the copula verb &quot;be&quot; together with the &quot;to&quot;-infinitive, e.g., &quot;John &quot;is to leave&quot; tonight&quot;. (With the zero copula of newspaper headline style, this becomes simply &quot;John to leave tonight&quot;.) For details see &quot;am to&quot;.
* The construction with &quot;to be about to&quot;, e.g., &quot;John is about to leave&quot;, referring to the expected immediate future. (A number of lexical expressions with similar meaning also exist, such as &quot;to be on the point of (doing something)&quot;.)
* Use of modal verbs with future meaning, to combine the expression of future time with certain modality: &quot;I &quot;must&quot; do this&quot; (also &quot;mun&quot; in Northern English dialect); &quot;We &quot;should&quot; help him&quot;; &quot;I &quot;can&quot; get out of here&quot;; &quot;We &quot;may&quot; win&quot;; &quot;You &quot;might&quot; succeed&quot;. The same modal verbs are also often used with present rather than future reference. For details of their meanings and usage, see English modal verbs.

Questions and negatives are formed from all of the above constructions in the regular manner: see Questions and Negation in the English grammar article. The auxiliaries &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; form the contracted negations &quot;won&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;shan&#x27;t&quot; (they can also sometimes be contracted when not negated, to &quot; &#x27;ll&quot;, such as in &quot;I&#x27;ll find it&quot;).

The various ways of expressing the future carry different meanings, implying not just futurity but also aspect (the way an action or state takes place in time) and/or modality (the attitude of the speaker toward the action or state). The precise interpretation must be based on the context. In particular there is sometimes a distinction in usage between the &quot;will/shall&quot; future and the &quot;going-to&quot; future (although in some contexts they are interchangeable). For more information see the &quot;going-to&quot; future article.

===Dutch===
Dutch can express the future in three ways:
*&quot;gaan&quot; + infinitive: Ik ga het boek lezen (I&#x27;m going to read the book). &quot;Gaan&quot; is a cognate of &quot;to go&quot;.
*&quot;zullen&quot; + infinitive: Ik zal het boek lezen (I will/shall read the book). &quot;Zullen&quot; is a cognate of &quot;shall&quot;.
* &quot;present tense&quot; + context or a temporal adverb or clause: &quot;Hoe lang blijft hij in Nederland&quot;? (How long is he staying in the Netherlands?) Its English-language equivalent uses the continuous or imperfective aspect.
&quot;Zullen&quot; + infinitive is more similar to &quot;shall&quot; than to &quot;will&quot;. It is used to:
*express a promise or a proposal
*emphasize that something will certainly happen
*express that an event is likely going to take place (by explicitly mentioning the probability)
English &quot;will&quot; and Dutch &quot;wil&quot;, although cognates, have over the centuries shifted in meaning, such that &quot;will&quot; is almost identical to &quot;shall&quot;, whereas Dutch &quot;wil&quot; means &quot;want&quot;, as in &quot;Ik wil het doen&quot; (I want to do it).

&quot;Gaan&quot; + infinitive can be compared with the English &quot;going to&quot; . It is used:
*to express an intended action (but not a promise, proposal, or solemn plan)
*to say that an event is going to take place (without emphasizing the certainty or mentioning the probability)

===Swedish===

Swedish &quot;skall&quot; strongly implies intention, but with an adverb such as &quot;nog&quot; &quot;probably&quot; it can avoid the implication of intentionality: &quot;Det här skall nog gå bra&quot; &quot;This will probably go well&quot;. However, the past tense of &quot;skall&quot;, &quot;skulle&quot;, can be used without such an adverb to express predictions in the past: &quot;Pelle sa, att det skulle bli varmt på eftermiddagen&quot; &quot;Pelle said that it would be warm in the afternoon.&quot;

Pure future, regardless of intention, is usually expressed with &quot;kommer att&quot; (literally: &quot;comes to&quot;): &quot;Det här kommer att gå bra&quot; &quot;This will go well&quot;, &quot;Du kommer att överleva det här&quot; &quot;You will survive this&quot;.

Generally, future tense is sparsely used in spoken Swedish, with the verb instead being put in present tense and accompanied by a distinct time specification: &quot;Jag åker till Spanien på fredag&quot; &quot;I travel to Spain on Friday&quot; &quot;Då ses vi imorgon.&quot; &quot;Then we meet tomorrow&quot;

== Latin and Romance ==
The future tense forms in Latin varied by conjugation. Here is a sample of the future tense for the first conjugation verb &quot;amare&quot;, &quot;to love&quot;.
See Latin conjugation for further details. Sound changes in Vulgar Latin made future forms difficult to distinguish from other verb forms (e.g., &quot;amabit&quot; &quot;he will love&quot; vs. &quot;amavit&quot; &quot;he loved&quot;), and the Latin simple future forms were gradually replaced by periphrastic structures involving the infinitive and an auxiliary verb, such as &quot;debere&quot;, &quot;venire&quot;, &quot;velle&quot;, or especially &quot;habere&quot;. All of the modern Romance languages have grammaticalized one of these periphrastic constructions for expressing the future tense; none of them has preserved the original Latin future, with the exception of Old French preserving the original Latin future forms of &quot;estre&quot; &quot;to be&quot;: &quot;jo (i)er&quot;, &quot;tu (i)ers&quot;, &quot;il (i)ert&quot;, &quot;nos (i)ermes&quot;, &quot;vos *(i)ertes&quot;, and &quot;il (i)erent&quot;, all of them were derived from &quot;erō&quot;, irregular future form of &quot;esse&quot; &quot;to be&quot;, in addition to future forms in &quot;ser-&quot; (&lt; &quot;sedēre&quot; &quot;to sit&quot;) or &quot;estr-&quot;.

===Future tense with &quot;habere&quot;===

While Classical Latin used a set of suffixes to the main verb for the future tense, later Vulgar Latin adopted the use of &quot;habere&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;) with the infinitive, as for example:

&quot;petant aut non petant venire habet&quot; (&quot;whether they ask or do not ask, it will come&quot;)

From this construction, the major Western Romance languages have simple future tense forms that derive from the infinitive followed by a conjugated form of the verb &quot;to have&quot; (Latin &quot;habere&quot;). As the auxiliary verb lost its modal force (from a verb expressing obligation, desire, or intention, to a simple marker of tense), it also lost syntactic autonomy (becoming an enclitic) and phonological substance (e.g., Latin first singular &quot;habeo&quot; &gt; &quot;ayyo&quot; &gt; Old French &quot;ai&quot;, Modern French ).

Thus the sequence of Latin verbs &quot;amare habeo&quot; (&quot;I have to love&quot;) gave rise to French &quot;aimerai&quot;, Spanish &quot;amaré&quot;, etc. &quot;I will love&quot;.



Phonetic changes also affected the infinitive in the evolution of this form, so that in the modern languages the future stem is not always identical to the infinitive. Consider the following Spanish examples:
* &quot;go out&quot;: infinitive &quot;salir&quot; → 1st. sing. future &quot;saldré&quot; in lieu of *&quot;saliré&quot;
* &quot;know&quot;: infinitive &quot;saber&quot; → 2nd. sing future &quot;sabrás&quot; in lieu of *&quot;saberás&quot;
* &quot;do&quot;: infinitive &quot;hacer&quot; → 3rd sing. future &quot;hará&quot; in lieu of *&quot;hacerá&quot;
* &quot;want&quot;: infinitive &quot;querer&quot; → 3rd pl. future &quot;querrán&quot; in lieu of *&quot;quererán&quot;

== Indo-Aryan languages ==

=== Hindi ===
In Hindi, verbs can be conjugated for three grammatical aspects (habitual, perfective, and progressive) and five grammatical moods (indicative, presumptive, subjunctive, contrafactual, and imperative). Out of the three aspects, the habitual mood of Hindi cannot be conjugated into the future tense. The indicative future is constructed from the subjunctive future forms. Imperatives in Hindi can also be put into future tense.

====Indicative and Subjunctive future====

There are two future subjunctive moods in modern Hindi, first the regular subjunctive and the second, the perfective subjunctive which superficially has the same form as the perfective aspect forms of verbs but still expresses future events, it is used with if clauses and relative clauses. In a semantic analysis, this use of the perfective aspect marker would not be considered perfective, since it is more closely related to subjunctive usage. Only the superficial form is identical to that of the perfective. This perfective subjunctive cannot be used as a coupla for aspectual participles.

The future indicative forms are constructed using the future subjunctive forms of verbs by adding the future suffix गा (-gā) which declines for number and gender of the grammatical person. The table below shows the future subjunctive and indicative forms of the verb करना karnā (to do).


====Prospective future====
The prospective future is constructed using the prospective future participle which is constructed from the oblique infinitive by adding the suffix वाला (-vālā) which also declines for the number and the gender of the pronoun. The participle is always followed by the auxiliary verb होना (honā)&quot; in its conjugated forms. The copula होना (honā)&quot; can be put into four grammatical moods: indicative, presumptive, subjunctive, and contrafactual. The table below shows the indicative mood forms of the prospective future for the verb करना karnā (to do).

====Imperative future====
Imperatives in Hindi can be conjugated into two tenses, present and future tense. The conjugations are mentioned in the table below for the verb करना karnā (to do). Hindi also has imperatives forms which are constructed form the subjunctive form of the verbs for the formal 2nd person pronoun आप (āp), and also third person pronouns to give indirect commands.

==Semitic languages==
===Hebrew===
Biblical Hebrew has a distinction between past and future tenses which is similar in form to those used in other Semitic languages such as Arabic and Aramaic. Gesenius refers to the past and future verb forms as Perfect and Imperfect, respectively, separating completed action from uncompleted action. However, the usage of verbs in these forms does not always have the same temporal meaning as in Indo-European languages, mainly due to the common use of a construct of inverting the time reference with a prefix &quot;Waw consecutive&quot; (ו&#x27; ההיפוך). With this construct, the Perfect-consecutive refers to the future and the Imperfect-consecutive refers to the past.

Usage of the imperfect to discuss future events is somewhat uncommon in Biblical Hebrew, as the Bible mainly discusses past events. It can be found in quoted speech, such as in the words of Moses (imperfect verbs stressed):


The Perfect-consecutive is commonly found in prophetic text, describing an unspecified future, as in the Book of Isaiah:

Modern Hebrew always employs the imperfect as the future tense (and the perfect as the past tense). The usage of &quot;Waw consecutive&quot; has practically disappeared, except for quotes from the Bible and Poetic language.

===Arabic===

To form future tense in Arabic the prefix (سـ) &quot;sa&quot; is added to the present tense verb, or (سوف) &quot;sawfa&quot;.

For example, consider the sentence:
To express the future we have two ways:


written as part of the verb
written as a Clitic to indicate the future but preceding the verb


In Classical Arabic the latter indicates an individual future action that usually takes place further in the future than the first mentioned form, which is usually used with verbs that relate to other actions, and mostly referring to rather near future actions.
However, in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) the distinction is minimal.

Moreover, the indication of the future tense in dialectal Arabic is quite varied from one dialect to the next.
Generally speaking, the words meaning &quot;want to&quot; (بدي / أريد أن), &quot;go to&quot; (أروح), &quot;intend to&quot;(ناوي /نويت), and many others are used daily to indicate future actions.
In Moroccan Arabic, the word &quot;Ghad&quot; (غاد) is used to indicate future, which literally means &quot;there&quot; (or there is to happen), that is in some way similar to the English formation &quot;there I go..&quot;

==Mandarin Chinese==
Mandarin Chinese has no grammatical tense, instead indicating time of action from the context or using adverbs. However, the auxiliary verb 會 / - &quot;huì&quot; / ㄏㄨㄟˋ, a modal meaning &quot;can&quot;, &quot;know how&quot;, can alternatively indicate futurity. For lexical futurity, the word &quot;yào&quot;, which can serve as a verb meaning &quot;to want&quot;, can also serve as an adverb meaning &quot;immediately&quot;: For example, &quot;wǒ yào xǐzǎo&quot; can mean either &quot;I want to bathe&quot; or &quot;I am about to bathe&quot;. 即 &quot;jí&quot;、將 &quot;jiāng&quot; serve a similar function as tense-marking adverbs.

==Creoles==
Creoles are languages with a vocabulary heavily based on a superstrate language but a grammar based on substrate languages and/or universal language tendencies. Some Creoles model a future tense/irrealis mood marker on &quot;go&quot; from the superstrate (analogous to English &quot;am going to&quot;). In many creoles the future can be indicated with the progressive aspect, analogous to the English &quot;I&#x27;m seeing him tomorrow.&quot; In general creoles tend to put less emphasis on marking tense than on marking aspect. When any of tense, aspect, and modality are specified, they are typically indicated with invariant pre-verbal markers in the sequence anterior relative tense (prior to the time focused on), irrealis mode (conditional or future), imperfective aspect.

===Jamaican English Creole===

The future marker in Jamaican Creole is /de go/ or /a go/: /de go hapm/ &quot;is going to happen&quot;, /mi a go ɹon/ &quot;I am going to run&quot;.

===Belizean Creole English===

In Belizean Creole, the future tense is indicated by a mandatory invariant pre-verbal particle /(w)a(n)/, /gwein/, or /gouɲ/.

===Gullah===

In Gullah the future is indicated by the pre-verbal marker &quot;gwine&quot;: &quot;Uh gwine he&#x27;p dem&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m going to help them&quot;.

===Hawaiian Creole English===

In Hawaiian Creole, the pre-verbal future marker is &quot;gon&quot;: &quot;Ai gon bai wan pikap&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m going to buy a pickup&quot;.

===Haitian Creole===

Haitian Creole, based on a French superstrate, interchangeably uses &quot;pral&quot; or &quot;va&quot; (from French 3rd person singular &quot;va&quot; &quot;goes&quot;) pre-verbally to indicate the future: &quot;Mwen va fini&quot; lit. &quot;I go finish&quot;; &quot;Li pral vini jodi a&quot; &quot;He will come today&quot;.

<text>Orchestra Hall is a concert hall at 3711 Woodward Avenue in Midtown Detroit, Michigan, United States. The hall is renowned for its superior acoustic properties and serves as the home of the internationally known Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO), the fourth oldest orchestra in the United States. With the creation of an adjoining auditorium for jazz and chamber music in 2003, Orchestra Hall became part of the Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Music Center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

==History==
The Detroit Symphony Orchestra had previously played at the old Detroit Opera House. However, Ossip Gabrilowitsch demanded that the DSO build a suitable auditorium before he assumed his position as music director. Construction on Orchestra Hall began on June 6, 1919, and was completed in barely six months.

The 2,014-seat hall was designed by the noted theater architect, C. Howard Crane. The first concert took place on October 23, 1919 and the hall remained the home of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra until 1939. In 1924 Mr. and Mrs. William H. Murphy gifted a large 4-manual, 72-rank, 4,355-pipe Casavant Frères organ to the DSO and Orchestra Hall &quot;so long as the society remained integrally what it was&quot;. The organ&#x27;s dedicatory concert was given March 17, 1924 by Marcel Dupré.

Due to the financial difficulties of the Great Depression, the orchestra was compelled to leave Orchestra Hall and enter into a more economical arrangement to share the Masonic Temple Theatre. Orchestra Hall was vacant for two years until it was purchased by new owners. For ten years Orchestra Hall presented jazz artists under the name Paradise Theater, opening on Christmas Eve 1941. The Paradise hosted the most renowned jazz musicians, including Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Count Basie, and Duke Ellington. The entertainment at Paradise Theater often included a live act and a movie from a B movie studio like Republic Pictures, Monogram Pictures, or Producers Releasing Corporation. A typical show on October 27, 1944 featured Cab Calloway and his Cotton Club Orchestra on stage and the movie &quot;That&#x27;s My Baby!&quot; (Monogram, 1944, Richard Arlen, Ellen Drew).

The terms of the Murphy organ&#x27;s donation to Orchestra Hall were such that the title of the organ reverted back to the Murphys when the DSO vacated Orchestra Hall in 1929. The Murphys arranged for the organ to be donated to Detroit&#x27;s Calvary Presbyterian Church. A lawsuit was filed to compel Paradise Theater management to allow the organ&#x27;s removal; the move was eventually carried out by the Toledo Pipe Organ Company and church members in the middle of the night.
The Paradise closed in 1951 and now Orchestra Hall sat vacant for nearly twenty years until the late 1960s when it was slated for demolition and the land used to construct a restaurant. Paul Ganson, the assistant principal bassoonist of the DSO, spearheaded a movement to rediscover the hall and raise funds to restore it. Renovation work started in 1970 and continued for about two decades, costing roughly $6.8 million. The original building required extensive renovations including: a new stage, all new seating, plaster and lath work, and restoration of historical decorations. All of the restoration work was completed with the goal of maintaining the fine acoustic properties that the hall was historically known for. The hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The DSO moved back into Orchestra Hall in 1989.

Additional work on the hall was done in the summer months of 2002 and 2003 as part of the creation of the new Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Music Center, or &quot;the MAX&quot;, as it is known. The work included renovations to the original facility as well as an expansion which houses additional lobbies and reception areas, dressing rooms and storage facilities, rehearsal space and a 450-seat venue for more intimate performances.

<text>Samuel Ramey (born March 28, 1942) is an American operatic bass. At the height of his career, he was greatly admired for his range and versatility, having possessed a sufficiently accomplished bel canto technique which enabled him to sing the music of Handel, Mozart and Rossini but with enough vocal power to handle the more overtly dramatic roles in Verdi, Puccini, and Meyerbeer operas.

==Early life==

Ramey graduated from Colby High School in Colby, Kansas in 1960. He studied music in high school and in college at Kansas State University, as well as at Wichita State with Arthur Newman. At Kansas State, he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.

Ramey was in the chorus of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in 1963, with Norman Treigle in the title role, while studying with the Central City Opera in Central City, Colorado. After being an apprentice with the Santa Fe Opera in Santa Fe, New Mexico, he worked for an academic publisher in New York City before he had his first breakthrough while at the New York City Opera debuting on March 11, 1973, as Zuniga in the 1875 Bizet opera &quot;Carmen.&quot; He took over that role as well as the Faustian devils in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Boito&#x27;s &quot;Mefistofele,&quot; which was vacated by the early death of Treigle.

As his repertoire expanded he worked extensively in European theaters notably in Berlin, Hamburg, London, Paris, Milan, and Vienna in addition to summer festivals in Aix-en-Provence, Glyndebourne, Pesaro, and Salzburg.

==Later career==
In January 1984, Ramey made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Rinaldo&quot;. He became a fixture at the Teatro alla Scala, Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, Vienna State Opera, the Paris Opera, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the New York City Opera, the San Francisco Opera and the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires (&quot;Attila&quot;, &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;Mefistofele&quot;) since then. In July 1985 he was cast as Bertram in the historic revival in Paris of Giacomo Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Robert le diable&quot;.

Ramey has sung in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and, in the bel canto repertoire, in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Semiramide&quot;, &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, &quot;Il Turco in Italia&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;, and &quot;La Gazza Ladra&quot;; in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; and &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; and Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot;. In the dramatic repertoire, Ramey has been acclaimed for his &quot;Three Devils&quot;: Boito&#x27;s &quot;Mefistofele&quot;, Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Berlioz&#x27;s dramatic legend &quot;Damnation of Faust&quot;. Other dramatic roles of his have included Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot;, &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, &quot;I masnadieri&quot;, &quot;I Lombardi&quot; and &quot;Jérusalem&quot;, as well as Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (he portrayed all four villains).

In 1990, he sang the role of Joe in Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;Show Boat&quot; in a concert performance at Avery Fisher Hall with Jerry Hadley and Frederica von Stade. A number of previously obscure operas with strong bass/bass-baritone roles have been revived solely for Ramey, such as Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Attila&quot;, Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Maometto II&quot; and Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Don Quichotte&quot;. He provided the voice for The Beast, the main antagonist of the 2014 animated miniseries &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;. In 1996, he gave a concert at New York&#x27;s Avery Fisher Hall titled &quot;A Date with the Devil&quot; in which he sang 14 arias representing the core of this repertory. He continued to tour with the program throughout the world. In 2000, he presented the concert at Munich&#x27;s Gasteig Concert Hall. The performance was recorded live and was released on compact disc in summer 2002.

He formerly served as a member of the faculty at Roosevelt University&#x27;s Chicago College of Performing Arts and is currently a distinguished professor of Opera at Wichita State University&#x27;s School of Music. He was named an inaugural member of the WSU College of Fine Arts Hall of Fame in 2015. He is a national patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity. He reprised the title role of &quot;Duke Bluebeard&quot; in Opera Omaha&#x27;s production of Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; in April 2013 in Omaha, Nebraska.

===Recordings===
Ramey has made an exceptionally high number of recordings documenting many of his main operatic roles as well as collections of miscellaneous arias, other classical pieces, and crossover discs of popular American music. He has appeared on television and video productions of the Met&#x27;s productions of &quot;Carmen&quot; and &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot;, San Francisco&#x27;s production of &quot;Mefistofele&quot;, Glyndebourne&#x27;s production of &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress,&quot; and Salzburg&#x27;s production of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

==Family==
He married his third wife, soprano Lindsey Larsen, on June 29, 2002. They have one son.

<text>Bobby Stanley Pons (born August 23, 1943) is an American electrochemist known for his work with Martin Fleischmann on cold fusion in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Early life==
Pons was born in Valdese, North Carolina. He attended Valdese High School, then Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he studied chemistry. He began his PhD studies in chemistry at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, but left before completing his PhD. His thesis resulted in a paper, co-authored in 1967 with Harry B. Mark, his adviser. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that it pioneered a way to measure the spectra of chemical reactions on the surface of an electrode.

He decided to finish his PhD in England at the University of Southampton, where in 1975 he met Martin Fleischmann. Pons was a student in Alan Bewick&#x27;s group; he earned his PhD in 1978.

==Career==
On March 23, 1989, while Pons was the chairman of the chemistry department at the University of Utah, he and Martin Fleischmann announced the experimental production of &quot;N-Fusion&quot;, which was quickly labeled by the press cold fusion. After a short period of public acclaim, hundreds of scientists attempted to reproduce the effects but generally failed. After the claims were found to be unreproducible, the scientific community determined the claims were incomplete and inaccurate.

Pons moved to France in 1992, along with Fleischmann, to work at a Toyota-sponsored laboratory. The laboratory closed in 1998 after a £12 million research investment without conclusive results. He gave up his US citizenship and became a French citizen.

<doc id="380325" wikidata="Q2154167" url="?curid=380325" title="Symphony Center">
<text>Symphony Center is a music complex located at 220 South Michigan Avenue in the Loop area of Chicago, Illinois. Home to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO); Chicago Symphony Chorus; Civic Orchestra of Chicago; and the Institute for Learning, Access, and Training; Symphony Center includes the 2,522-seat Orchestra Hall, which dates from 1904; Buntrock Hall, a rehearsal and performance space named for the CSO trustee and benefactor Dean L. Buntrock; Grainger Ballroom, an event space overlooking Michigan Avenue and the Art Institute of Chicago; a public multi-story rotunda; Forte, a restaurant and café; and administrative offices. In June 1993, plans to significantly renovate and expand Orchestra Hall were approved and the $110 million project resulting in Symphony Center, completed in 1997.

Designed by architect Daniel Burnham, Orchestra Hall was designated a National Historic Landmark on April 19, 1994. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978.

==History==
Built in 1904, Orchestra Hall was designed by renowned Chicago architect Daniel Burnham. The new hall was specifically designed as a home for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which had previously performed in the larger Auditorium Theater. Construction began on May 1, 1904, and the first concert was given on December 14, 1904. The building has &quot;Theodore Thomas Orchestra Hall&quot; inscribed in its façade, after the orchestra&#x27;s first music director who died less than a month after his conducting debut there. The names Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Wagner are inscribed above the ballroom windows on the façade.

From 1907 through 1996 the ninth-floor penthouse of the building served as the home of the Cliff Dwellers Club, with interior architecture by Howard Van Doren Shaw and the first significant mural of John Warner Norton.

The administrative offices are located within the historic Chapin and Gore Building, which was built in 1904. The building was designed by architectural partners Richard E. Schmidt and Hugh M. G. Garden. The building was attached to the Symphony Center campus as part of the 1997 renovation. 

Orchestra Hall was also used as a movie theater during the 1910s, to maintain income during the summer months, when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was playing at the Ravinia Festival. Lectures and other programs were held at Orchestra Hall in with speakers including Harry Houdini, Richard E. Byrd, Amelia Earhart, Bertrand Russell and Orson Welles.

In 2008 the venue hosted the 2008 Green National Convention alongside the Palmer House Hilton.

In 2012 the venue hosted the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates alongside the UIC Pavilion. This was held in Chicago simultaneous to the 2012 Chicago Summit.

==Acoustical history==
Sub-optimal acoustics within Orchestra Hall have been an ongoing concern throughout its history, and have been adjusted in major overhauls of the main hall in both the late 1960s and as part of the Symphony Center transformation between 1995 and 1997.

Critical reaction is that the 1995–1997 acoustical revamp was largely successful, though with room for further improvement, particularly in the upper registers. Reviews at the time noted &quot;[the hall] sounded altogether new, with a depth and spaciousness never before heard here. ... The low strings, especially, had a new warmth and solidity, and the whole bass and baritonal range of the orchestra provided a firmer basis and a mellower foil for the sound above it, which has always been brash and brilliant. ... Not that everything is perfect. High frequencies can still sound glassy, and the high strings have not yet benefited as much as their brethren. [Supervising acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard] had already begun to work on the problem after a private concert on Tuesday evening and continues to do so.&quot;, &quot;The orchestra now has a mellow bass sound that simply didn&#x27;t exist before. Bass drums, previously the source of loud, dry thwacks, have a new resonance and texture. Violins have a richer color,&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s fair to say that Orchestra Hall is, overall, vastly improved. The reverberation time, almost nonexistent before, is much lengthened. The strings, particularly in the lower ranges, are far more audible than was once the case, and all of the instruments resound with far more bloom, warmth, and brilliance. The sound is a good deal better in the other traditional trouble spot, the main floor beneath the balcony overhang, superb in the lower balcony and altogether glorious in the gallery.&quot;

In a review of a piano recital, not an orchestral concert, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; music critic John von Rhein wrote &quot;...everything registered with the impact of the old hall, only better. There was more warmth, more space, around the keyboard. Similar reports came from listeners in the gallery.&quot;. However, the same critic also noted shortly after the renovation &quot;As of now, the low end has been dramatically enhanced, perhaps too much so. The lower strings and lower brass are going to have to modify their sound output to the new sensitivities of the acoustics. In many ways, then, Orchestra Hall is a work in progress. The coming weeks and months will require adjustments from players and audience members alike. Lawrence Kirkegaard ... said he and his associates were &#x27;intensively involved&#x27; in minor adjustments last week and will continue to tinker with the sound sporadically throughout the season,&quot; and some years after the transformation, critics at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper expressed dissatisfaction with the Orchestra Hall acoustics.

<doc id="380334" wikidata="Q316880" url="?curid=380334" title="Monumenta Germaniae Historica">
<text>The  (Latin for &quot;Historical Monuments of Germany&quot;), frequently abbreviated MGH, is a comprehensive series of carefully edited and published primary sources, both chronicle and archival, for the study of parts of Northwestern, Central and Southern European history from the end of the Roman Empire to 1500. 

Despite the name, the series covers important sources for the history of many countries besides Germany, since the Society for the Publication of Sources on Germanic Affairs of the Middle Ages has included documents from many other areas subjected to the influence of Germanic tribes or rulers (Britain, Czech lands, Poland, Austria, France, Low Countries, Italy, Spain, etc.).

==History==
The MGH was founded in Hanover as a private text publication society by the Prussian reformer Heinrich Friedrich Karl Freiherr vom Stein in 1819. The first volume appeared in 1826. The editor from 1826 until 1874 was Georg Heinrich Pertz (1795–1876), who was succeeded by Georg Waitz (1813–1886). 

Many eminent medievalists from Germany and, eventually, other countries, joined in the project of searching out and comparing manuscripts and producing scholarly editions. The motto chosen, (&quot;Sacred love for the fatherland gives the spirit&quot;), is explained as linking Romantic nationalism with professional scholarship. 

In 1875, the MGH was established as a more formal institution with headquarters in Berlin. 

In 1935, the organization was taken over by the state and renamed the (&quot;National Institute for Older German History&quot;). This was abolished in 1945, at the end of World War II. 

The institute was later revived under its original name with the support of German institutions and the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The Monumenta Germaniae Historica Institute has been located in Munich since 1949 and possesses a large specialized library on the medieval history of Germany and Europe, including Church history, along with 130,000 monographs and approximately 150,000 dependent writings. 

During the late 1940s, Margarete Kühn used her work on the MGH as cover for taking the Wiesbaden Codex from Soviet control in Dresden and having it returned to Eibingen and then to the State Library of Wiesbaden. 

The MGH moved into its current premises in the building of the Bavarian State Library in 1967. 

The project, a major effort of historical scholarship, continues in the 21st century. In 2004 the MGH, with the support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, made all of its publications in print for more than five years available online, in photo-digital reproduction, via a link on the MGH homepage.

==Divisions==
The series falls into five main divisions, (&quot;Antiquities&quot;), (&quot;Documents&quot;), (&quot;Letters&quot;), (&quot;Laws&quot;), and (&quot;Authors&quot;), with an additional smaller division of (&quot;Necrology&quot;). Many subsidiary series have also been established, including a series of more compact volumes for school use () and special studies ().

<text>Yancy Victoria Butler (born July 2, 1970) is an American actress. She is known for her roles as Natasha Binder in the 1993 film &quot;Hard Target&quot;, Jess Crossman in &quot;Drop Zone&quot; (1994), and Detective Sara Pezzini on the TNT supernatural drama series &quot;Witchblade&quot;. For her performance in &quot;Witchblade&quot;, she won a Saturn Award for Best Actress in a Television Series.

==Early life==
Yancy Victoria Butler was born in Greenwich Village in Manhattan, the daughter of Leslie Vega, a theatre company manager, and Joe Butler, the drummer and vocalist for the 1960s rock group the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful.

Butler attended Sarah Lawrence College, graduating in 1991.

==Career==
According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, a fan site dedicated to Butler described her as having an &quot;unmistakable husky voice and big, intense eyes&quot;; flattered, she told the newspaper: &quot;That makes me sound like Peter Lorre.&quot; Butler&#x27;s first major role was in the television series &quot;Mann &amp; Machine&quot; in 1992, in which she played an android police officer partnered with a human detective. The series was set in Los Angeles in the near future. The series was co-created by Dick Wolf. A year later, she starred in her second series, &quot;South Beach&quot;, in which she played a con artist and thief who made a deal with the federal government; in exchange for their wiping of her criminal record, she performs certain tasks for them.

Butler&#x27;s first film appearance was a small supporting role in the 1979 slasher film &quot;Savage Weekend&quot;. Her next film appearance was a starring role in John Woo&#x27;s 1993 film, &quot;Hard Target&quot;. She then starred in the 1994 film &quot;Drop Zone&quot;. In 1995, she starred as Corinne the dancer in the film &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;. Butler was cast as a series regular in the CBS television series &quot;Brooklyn South&quot; playing Anne-Marie Kersey, a Brooklyn policewoman, which ran for one season from 1997 to 1998.

Butler starred in the television film &quot;Witchblade&quot; (2000) and the subsequent television series, adapted from the ongoing comic book of the same title; the series ran for two seasons on the Turner Network Television network for a total of 23 episodes. The series has a cult following, and was ranked seventh in the Top 10 Basic Cable Dramas for 2002. The show&#x27;s cancellation was announced after the second season in September 2002.

In 2005, Butler starred in the film &quot;Bloodlines&quot;. For distribution purposes, it was retitled in 2006 as &quot;Striking Range&quot;. In 2007, she appeared in 13 episodes of the television soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, as Ava Jenkins. She was confirmed to appear in &quot;Tales of an Ancient Empire&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;The Sword and the Sorcerer&quot;. On January 24, 2012, &quot;Tales of an Ancient Empire&quot; was released on DVD. Butler, however, did not appear in the film. She appeared in a small role in another comic-book adaptation, the film version of &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;.

==Legal issues==
In November 2003, Butler was taken into custody in Delray Beach, Florida, for disorderly intoxication and sentenced to a substance-abuse treatment program. In 2007, she was charged with driving under the influence after she crashed her car. 

On April 3, 2017, Butler was arrested in Sag Harbor, New York, and charged with aggravated drunken driving and possession of drugs after she was found passed out behind the wheel of her car after it had hopped a curb onto the sidewalk.

==Personal life==
As of 2025, Butler lives in Winnetka, Los Angeles.

==Filmography==
===Film===
===Television===
==Awards==
On June 10, 2002, Butler won a Saturn Award for Best Actress in a Television Series, at the 29th Annual Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films Awards ceremony, for her performances in &quot;Witchblade&quot;.

<doc id="380338" wikidata="Q970614" url="?curid=380338" title="Polysome">
<text>A polyribosome (or polysome or ergosome) is a group of ribosomes bound to an mRNA molecule like “beads” on a “thread”. It consists of a complex of an mRNA molecule and two or more ribosomes that act to translate mRNA instructions into polypeptides. Originally coined &quot;ergosomes&quot; in 1963, they were further characterized by Jonathan Warner, Paul M. Knopf, and Alex Rich.

Polysomes are formed during the elongation phase when ribosomes and elongation factors synthesize the encoded polypeptide. Multiple ribosomes move along the coding region of mRNA, creating a polysome. The ability of multiple ribosomes to function on an mRNA molecule explains the limited abundance of mRNA in the cell. Polyribosome structure differs between prokaryotic polysomes, eukaryotic polysomes, and membrane bound polysomes. Polysome activity can be used to measure the level of gene expression through a technique called polysomal profiling.

== Structure ==

Electron microscopy technologies such as staining, metal shadowing, and ultra-thin cell sections were the original methods to determine polysome structure. The development of cryo-electron microscopy techniques has allowed for increased resolution of the image, leading to a more precise method to determine structure. Different structural configurations of polyribosomes could reflect a variety in translation of mRNAs. An investigation of the ratio of polyribosomal shape elucidated that a high number of circular and zigzag polysomes were found after several rounds of translation. A longer period of translation caused the formation of densely packed 3-D helical polysomes. Different cells produce different structures of polysomes.

=== Prokaryotic ===
Bacterial polysomes have been found to form double-row structures. In this conformation, the ribosomes are contacting each other through smaller subunits. These double row structures generally have a “sinusoidal” (zigzag) or 3-D helical path. In the “sinusoidal” path, there are two types of contact between the small subunits- “top-to-top” or “top-to-bottom”. In the 3-D helical path, only “top-to-top” contact is observed.

Polysomes are present in archaea, but not much is known about the structure.

=== Eukaryotic ===

==== In cells ====
&quot;in situ&quot; (in cell) studies have shown that eukaryotic polysomes exhibit linear configurations. Densely packed 3-D helices and planar double-row polysomes were found with variable packing including “top-to-top” contacts similar to prokaryotic polysomes. Eukaryotic 3-D polyribosomes are similar to prokaryotic 3-D polyribosomes in that they are “densely packed left-handed helices with four ribosomes per turn”. This dense packing can determine their function as regulators of translation, with 3-D polyribosomes being found in sarcoma cells using fluorescence microscopy.

==== Cell free ====
Atomic force microscopy used in &quot;in vitro&quot; studies have shown that circular eukaryotic polysomes can be formed by free polyadenylated mRNA in the presence of initiation factor eIF4E bound to the 5’ cap and PABP bound to the 3’-poly(A) tail. However, this interaction between cap and the poly(A)-tail mediated by a protein complex is not a unique way of circularizing polysomal mRNA. It has been found that topologically circular polyribosomes can be successfully formed in the translational system with mRNA with no cap and no poly(A) tail as well as a capped mRNA without a 3’-poly(A) tail.

=== Membrane-bound ===
Polyribosomes bound to membranes are restricted by a 2 dimensional space given by the membrane surface. The restriction of inter-ribosomal contacts causes a round-shape configuration that arranges ribosomes along the mRNA so that the entry and exit sites form a smooth pathway. Each ribosome is turned relative to the previous one, resembling a planar spiral.

== Profiling ==
Polysomal profiling is a technique that uses cycloheximide to arrest translation and a sucrose gradient to separate the resulting cell extract by centrifugation. Ribosome-associated mRNAs migrate faster than free mRNAs and polysome associated mRNAs migrate faster than ribosome associated mRNAs. Several peaks corresponding to mRNA are revealed by the measurement of total protein across the gradient. The corresponding mRNA is associated with increasing numbers of ribosomes as polysomes. The presence of mRNA across the gradient reveals the translation of the mRNA. Polysomal profiling is optimally applied to cultured cells and tissues to track the translational status of an identified mRNA as well as measure ribosome density. This technique has been used to compare the translational status of mRNAs in different cell types.

For example, polysomal profiling was used in a study to investigate the effect of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in mammalian cells. The data from polysomal profiling showed that host mRNAs are outcompeted by viral mRNAs for polysomes, therefore decreasing the translation of host mRNA and increasing the translation of viral mRNA.

<doc id="380343" wikidata="Q785918" url="?curid=380343" title="Kegworth">
<text>Kegworth () is a large village and civil parish in the North West Leicestershire district of Leicestershire, in the East Midlands region, England. It forms part of the border with Nottinghamshire and is situated 6 miles north of Loughborough, 12 miles southwest of Nottingham, 12.5 miles southeast of Derby and 17 miles north of Leicester. The population of Kegworth census was 3,601.

Lying on the River Soar, it is situated on the A6 near junction 24 of the M1 motorway and is also close to East Midlands Airport, the East Midlands Gateway freight terminal and East Midlands Parkway railway station. The village is served by a primary school that was rated good at its last Ofsted inspection, and which takes children from ages 4 to 10 years. Beyond the primary school age, most children attend schools in Castle Donington and Shepshed. The village has both Anglican and Baptist churches. Shops in the village include a supermarket, butcher, pharmacy and optician. There are a number of cafes, restaurants and takeaway food outlets including Fish &amp; Chips, Indian and Chinese cuisine. Kegworth has several public houses, a doctor&#x27;s surgery and a village hall that hosts village events and the local playgroup. Kegworth has thriving sports clubs, which include the Kegworth Imperial football club, Kegworth Town Cricket Club and Kegworth Bowls Club. There are five parks with play areas for younger children and a skate park. The village has a library and a museum of local history. One Kegworth community group also organise many village events throughout the year such as the Easter Charter market, Sideley Park family fun day and food festival, and the Christmas market. The village is a short distance away from one of the Campuses of the University of Nottingham at Sutton Bonington, and the population is boosted by students living in the village.

Nearby places include Long Eaton, Castle Donington, Sutton Bonington, Ratcliffe on Soar, Zouch, Kingston on Soar and Hathern. The post town is Derby, with the Derby postcode prefix of DE74.

Kegworth is twinned with Bois-Guillaume, a suburban town located on the plateau immediately to the north of Rouen in Normandy, north-western France.

==History==
The site of Kegworth was situated well within the territory of the Coritani (or Corieltauvi), one of the most powerful Ancient British tribes. A date cannot be put on the foundations of the first settlement, although Anglo-Saxon burials have been found in Kingston-on-Soar and at Hathern, a pin from the 7th century was also found near the hermitage, which may indicate the date and location of the earliest settlers. The name of Kegworth comes from two languages, Old English and Danish, so it must date from some time between 874 and 1086. It means &quot;worth&quot; or &quot;enclosure&quot; of a man named Kaggi, the Danish name for redbeard.
However, some sources claim it may mean locked enclosure, from caega &quot;key&quot;, an Old English word. It was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as being held by Earl Harold Godwin, who became the last of the Saxon kings. After Harold&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 the Earl Hugh of Chester was given the land by William the Conqueror. It was known in those days as Cachworde, Caggworth and Cogga.
After the royalists defeated Simon de Montfort in 1265, estates gained by the Earl of Gloucester included land in Kegworth. The privilege to hold a weekly market was granted in 1290. During the Middle Ages the parish was responsible for maintaining the condition of the roads. To try to improve the rough roads in the village, an Act of Parliament was passed in 1555 ordering every man in the parish to work for four (later six) days a year on the roads; each farmer had to provide horses and carts according to his land holding. This continued until the early 18th century when, with the increase in traffic, it became necessary to change this to paid labour.

Although farming was a large factor in Kegworth life and still remains on the fringes, industry started in the late 18th century/early 19th century with the introduction of stockingers shops. Some still exist (e.g. behind the former Britannia public house) and can be recognised by the long rows of windows on the first floor. As the industry grew, small courtyards of cottages were built in the old farm yards. Women and children also worked when they could, and the hosiery and lace trade were ranked as two of the most important industries in the village from 1841 onwards. The Kegworth hand frame stockingers were highly skilled in the art of making silk stockings and they received many orders from royalty and people of high rank. Queen Victoria, the Prince of Wales, the Danish royal family and the King of Spain were all customers of the stockingers of Kegworth. Meeting House Yard lay behind the present &#x27;Friends&#x27; Cottage&#x27;, and included a Quaker graveyard. The last trace of these &#x27;yards&#x27; was demolished when the entrance to Australia Yard was removed to make way for the library in High Street.
A depression in the 1890s coincided with the introduction of the internal combustion engine, a motorbike factory was started that developed into the present Slack and Parrs. Domestic service was also important. In 1851 as many as 121 people were described as servants, housekeepers or charwomen. In 1899 their work was arduous with long hours, and the restricted personal freedom and the lack of privacy was poor by the standards of today but at the time they counted themselves lucky to be fed, clothed and housed. Industrialisation was the beginning of the end of this era in Kegworth&#x27;s history, but there were still socks and stockings being made in the village as late as the 1940s. Despite the growth in trade and manufacturing, there was only a very slight increase in population during the 19th century. The number of inhabitants rose from 1,416 people in 1801 to 2,078 a century later, but with actual decline in some decades, today there are approximately 3,500 people living in the village with 1,500 houses.
47 people died in a plane crash on 8 January 1989, when it came down just short of the runway on the eastern side of the nearby East Midlands Airport. Although this was outside the village, it has subsequently been referred to as the Kegworth air disaster. A memorial to those who died in the crash stands in the village cemetery on Whatton Road. There is also a plaque sited on the Ashby Road bridge over the M1, close to where the plane came down. Since 1989, the Parish Council and those who remember that fateful night have marked each anniversary by laying wreaths at both memorial sites. A special commemorative service was held in 2019 at St Andrew&#x27;s Church in the village, to mark the 30th anniversary of the disaster. Survivors, relatives and emergency services first-responders attended.

Kegworth has always prospered from its advantages of trade and routes. Originally these were farming, road and river, later textiles, railway and canal, and now light industry, motorway and airport. It has been lucky in having relative prosperity and slow but steady growth, which has given it the character of a friendly, active community. The nearby University of Nottingham Sutton Bonington Campus has grown markedly since 2006 and many students now live in the village. A number of modern housing developments to the south of the village expanded Kegworth in the 2010s and further developments are making use of brown field sites. Kegworth was part of the rural district of Castle Donington until 1974 when it became part of the district of North West Leicestershire, whose administrative centre is located at Coalville.

==Structures==

The earliest surviving building is St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church. The tower base dates from 1250 and the rest was built in 1370 when the two manors of Kegworth were united under a single Lord of the Manor. The next oldest building visible is the Cruck Cottage forming the street front of the Cottage Restaurant. This is from the 15th century, but the stucco covering conceals its age. Many other buildings similarly hide their oldest parts under stucco or modern fronts, as at the top of Packington Hill, where early 18th-century timber frames show at the rear.

Many buildings in High Street and London Road date from the 18th century, when the main London to Manchester road went up High Street and down Packington Hill. Some were town houses, others farmhouses with yards. Most of the latter have had their yards subsequently built on. The barn of number 55 High Street was demolished in 1979 to make room for another house, but the farmyard of number 48 remains, although the farmhouse was rebuilt in Victorian times. The internal road system of the village gradually developed as time went on as it became necessary to obtain access to neighbouring villages. The Romans used a ford across the River Trent nearby and a Romano-British farm lies at the end of Long Lane. A Saxon cemetery was found two hundred years ago and the bumps and hollows between the A6 and the River Soar may be the remains of a Saxon village.

==Notable people==
Thomas Parkinson was Rector of Kegworth from 1789 until his death in 1830.

Cartoonist Bill Tidy was a long-term resident of Kegworth in the 1980s and 1990s.

Biologist Keith Campbell was resident in the village. He is well known as one of the team to clone the sheep Dolly and produced further clones, sisters to Dolly, during his time in Kegworth.

Irish poet Thomas Moore lived at The Cedars, London Road, Kegworth, for almost a year.

<doc id="380350" wikidata="Q192180" url="?curid=380350" title="Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic">
<text>The Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic (Also known as the Latvian SSR, or Latvia) was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union from 1940 to 1941, and then from 1944 until 1990.

The Soviet occupation and annexation of Latvia began between June and August 1939, according to the agreed terms of the secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. In 1939, Latvia was forced to give military bases on its soil to the Soviet Union, and in 1940 the Red Army moved into Latvia, effectively annexing it into the Soviet Union.

The territory changed sides during World War II, with Nazi Germany occupying a large portion of Latvian territory from 1941 until the Red Army entered Latvia in 1944 with the final territory occupied by the Germans liberated in 1945. The Soviet occupation of the Baltic states from 1939 to 1940 and then from 1944 to 1991 was widely considered illegal by the international community and human rights organizations.

Soviet instability during the 1980s and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 provided an opportunity for Latvia to restore its independence.

==Creation in 1940==
On 24 September 1939, USSR bombers entered the airspace of Estonia, flying numerous intelligence-gathering operations. On 25 September, Moscow demanded that Estonia sign a Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty to allow the USSR to establish military bases and station troops on its soil. Latvia was next in line, as the USSR demanded the signing of a similar treaty. The authoritarian government of Kārlis Ulmanis accepted the ultimatum, signing the Soviet–Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty on 5 October 1939. On 16 June 1940, after the USSR had already invaded Lithuania, it issued an ultimatum to Latvia, followed by the Soviet occupation of Latvia on 17 June.

Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov had accused Latvia and the Baltic states of forming a military conspiracy against the Soviet Union. Moscow presented ultimatums, demanding new concessions, including the replacement of governments with new ones, &quot;determined to fulfill the treaties of friendship sincerely&quot; and allowing an unlimited number of troops to enter the three countries. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops entered Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. These additional Soviet military forces far outnumbered their individual armies.

The Ulmanis government decided that, given the conditions of international isolation and the overwhelming Soviet force both on the borders and inside the country, it was better to avoid bloodshed and an unwinnable war. The Latvian Army did not fire a shot and was quickly decimated by purges, then incorporated into the Soviet Army.

Ulmanis&#x27; government resigned and was replaced by a left-wing government created under instructions from the USSR embassy. Until the election of the People&#x27;s Parliament on the 14/15th of July 1940, there were no public statements about governmental plans to introduce a Soviet political order or to join the Soviet Union. Soon after the occupation, the Communist Party of Latvia became the only legal party and presented the &quot;Latvian Working People&#x27;s Bloc&quot; for the elections. It was the only permitted participant in the election after an attempt by other politicians to include the Democratic Bloc (an alliance of all banned Latvian parties, except the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party) on the ballot was prevented by the government. Its office was closed, election leaflets confiscated, and its leaders arrested.

The election results were fabricated; the Soviet press released them so early that they appeared in a London newspaper 24 hours before the polls closed. All Soviet army personnel present in the country were allowed to vote.

The newly elected People&#x27;s Parliament convened on 21 July and announced both the creation of the Latvian SSR and the request of admission into the Soviet Union. A change in the constitutional order of the state was illegal under the Constitution of Latvia because a change was only possible after a plebiscite with two-thirds of the electorate&#x27;s approval. On 5 August, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union completed the annexation process and accepted the Latvian petition, formally incorporating Latvia into the Soviet Union. 

Following the annexation, power in the republic was held by the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Latvia, while the titular head of the republic (Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet), and the head of the executive (the Chairman of the Soviet of the Ministers), were in subordinate positions. Therefore, the history of Soviet Latvia can broadly be divided into the periods of rule by the First Secretaries: Jānis Kalnbērziņš, Arvīds Pelše, Augusts Voss, and Boris Pugo. 

==Era of Kalnbērziņš, 1940–1959==
===The Horrible Year, 1940–41===

In the following months of 1940, the Soviet Constitution and criminal code (copied from Russian) were introduced. The elections of July 1940 were followed by elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in January 1941. The remaining Baltic Germans and anyone that could claim to be one emigrated to Nazi Germany.

On 7 August 1940, all print media and printing houses were nationalized. Most existing magazines and newspapers were discontinued or appeared under new Soviet names. In November 1940, banning books began; in total, 4,000 titles were banned and removed from circulation. Arrests of authors like Aleksandrs Grīns occurred during this time. 

As Latvia implemented a sweeping land reform after the independence, most farms were too small for nationalization. While rumors of impending collectivization were officially denied in 1940 and 52,000 landless peasants were given small plots of up to 10 ha, in early 1941, preparations for collectivization began. The small size of land plots and imposition of the production quotas and high taxes meant that independent farmers would likely go bankrupt and had to establish collective farms.

Arrests and deportations to the Soviet Union began before Latvia was annexed. Initially, they were limited to the most prominent political and military leaders like President Kārlis Ulmanis, War Minister Jānis Balodis, and Army Chief Krišjānis Berķis, who were arrested in July 1940. The Soviet NKVD arrested most of the White Russian émigrés, who had found refuge in Latvia. Very soon, purges reached the upper echelons of the puppet government when Minister of Welfare Jūlijs Lācis was arrested.

====14 June deportations====

In early 1941, the Soviet central government planned the mass deportation of &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot; from the occupied Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. In preparation, General Ivan Serov, Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar of Public Security of the Soviet Union, signed the Serov Instructions, &quot;Regarding the Procedure for Carrying out the Deportation of Anti-Soviet Elements from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.&quot; During the night of 13 to 14 June 1941, 15,424 inhabitants of Latvia — including 1,771 Jews and 742 ethnic Russians — were deported to camps and special settlements, most of which were in Siberia. 

Among the deported were such obvious candidates as former politicians, wealthy bourgeois and farmers, police, members of Aizsargi, and NGO leaders, even philatelists and enthusiasts of Esperanto were included in the June deportation as unreliable elements. 600 Latvian officers were arrested in the Litene army camp, and many were executed on the spot. Many political prisoners were summarily executed in prisons across Latvia during the hasty Soviet retreat after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Latvia lost 35,000 people during the first year of Soviet rule.

===World War II, 1941–1945===

The start of Operation Barbarossa cut short immediate plans to deport several hundred thousand more people. German troops occupied Riga on 1 July 1941. A few days later, Reichskommissariat Ostland, was established incorporating the territories of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, and parts of Byelorussia.

During the short interregnum period, Latvians created two political bodies that sought to restore independent Latvia: the Central Organizing Committee for Liberated Latvia and the Provisional State Council. 

Immediately after the installment of Nazi German authority, the process of eliminating the Jewish and Gypsy populations began, with many killings taking place in Rumbula. 

Massacres were mainly committed by the Einsatzgruppe A, the Wehrmacht, and Marines (in Liepāja), as well as Latvian collaborators, which included the 500 to 1,500 members of the Arajs Kommando (which alone killed around 26,000 Jews) and the 2,000 or more Latvian members of the SD. By the end of 1941, almost the entire Jewish population had been killed or placed in the death camps. In addition, some 25,000 Jews were brought from Germany, Austria, and present-day Czechia, of whom around 20,000 were killed. The Holocaust claimed approximately 85,000 lives in Latvia, of whom the vast majority were Jews.

A large number of Latvians resisted the German occupation. The resistance movement was divided between the pro-independence politicians of the Latvian Central Council and the armed Soviet partisan units under the Latvian Partisan Movement Headquarters (латвийский штаб партизанского движения) in Moscow. The commander was of the communists was Arturs Sproģis. 

The Nazis planned to Germanize the Baltic&#x27;s by settling some 520,000 German settlers there 20–25 years after the war. In 1943 and 1944, two divisions of Latvian Legion were created through a forced mobilization and made a part of the Waffen SS to help Germany fight the Red Army. 

===Stalinism re-imposed, 1945–1953===


In the middle of 1944, when the Soviet Operation Bagration reached Latvia, heavy fighting took place between German and Soviet troops, which ended with a stalemate and the creation of the Courland Pocket, which allowed some 130,000 Latvians to escape to Sweden and Germany. 

During the war, both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies, which increased the loss of the nation&#x27;s &quot;live resources.&quot; In Courland, Latvian Legion units fought battles against Latvians of the Red Army. 

Latvia lost some 20% of its population during World War II. In 1944 part of Abrene District, about 2% of Latvia&#x27;s territory, was illegally ceded to the RSFSR. 

In 1944, the Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system. After re-establishing military control over the country, in February 1946, elections of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Supreme Soviet were held, followed, in February 1947, by Latvian Supreme Soviet elections and only in January 1948 elections to the local Soviets. 

====Guerrilla movement====
After the German surrender, it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay and Latvian national partisans began their fight against the Soviet Union. At their peak, some 10,000–15,000 partisans in disorganized units fought local battles against Soviets, NKVD troops and Soviet government representatives. Forest brothers consisted not only of the former Legionnaires or German supporters but also of men who were trying to avoid Soviet conscription, dispossessed farmers, and even priests and school pupils who wrote and distributed patriotic leaflets and provided shelter to partisans. Many believed that a new war between the Western powers and the Soviet Union was imminent and expected Latvia to be liberated soon. After the 1949 deportations and collectivization, the resistance movement decreased sharply, with the last few individuals surrendering in 1956 when amnesty was offered. The last holdout was Jānis Pīnups, who hid from authorities until 1995. 

====Deportations of 1949====
120,000 Latvian inhabitants deemed disloyal by the Soviets were imprisoned or deported to Soviet labor camps (the Gulag). Some escaped arrest and joined the Forest Brothers.

On 25 March 1949, 43,000 primarily rural residents (&quot;kulaks&quot;) were deported to Siberia and northern Kazakhstan in Operation Priboi, which was implemented in all three Baltic States and was approved in Moscow on 29 January 1949. Almost 30% of those deported were children under 16.

==== Collectivization ====
In the post-war period, Latvia was forced to adopt Soviet farming methods, and the economic infrastructure developed in the 1920s and 1930s was eradicated. Farms belonging to refugees were confiscated, German supporters had their farm sizes sharply reduced, and much of the farmland became state-owned. The remaining farmers&#x27; taxes and obligatory produce delivery quotas were increased until individual farming became impossible. Many farmers killed their cattle and moved to cities. In 1948 collectivization began in earnest and was intensified after the March 1949 deportations, and by the end of the year, 93% of farms were collectivized.

Collective farming was extremely unprofitable as farmers had to plant and harvest according to the state plan and not the actual harvest conditions, and farmers were paid close to nothing for their produce. Grain production in Latvia collapsed from 1.37 million tons in 1940 to 0.73 million tons in 1950 and to 0.43 million tons in 1956. Only in 1965 did Latvia reach the meat and dairy output levels of 1940.

====Russian dominance====
During the first post-war years, Moscow&#x27;s control was enforced by the Special Bureau of CPSU Central Committee, led by Mikhail Suslov. To ensure total control over the local Communist party, Ivan Lebedev, a Russian, was elected the Second Secretary. This tradition continued until the end of the Soviet system. The lack of politically reliable local cadres meant the Soviets increasingly placed Russians in Party and government leadership positions. Many &quot;Russian Latvian&quot; Communists who had survived the so-called 1937–38 &quot;Latvian Operation&quot; during the Great Purge were sent back to the homeland of their parents. Most of these Soviets did not speak Latvian, and this only enforced the wall of distrust against the local population. By 1953 Latvia&#x27;s Communist Party had 42,000 members, half of whom were Latvians.

Hundreds of thousands of Russians were moved to Latvia to replace the lost population (due to war casualties, refugees to the West, and deportees to the East) and to implement a heavy industrialization program. An extensive program of Russification was initiated, limiting the use of Latvian and minority languages. In addition, the Russian people&#x27;s leading and progressive role throughout Latvian history was heavily emphasized in school books, arts, and literature. The remaining poets, writers, and painters had to follow the strict canons of socialist realism and live in constant fear of being accused of some ideological mistake that could lead to banning from publication or even arrest.

===National Communists, 1953–1959===

During the short rule of Lavrentiy Beria in 1953, the policy of giving more power to local communists and respecting local languages was introduced. More freedoms came after the 1956 de-Stalinization. Some 30,000 survivors of Soviet deportations began returning to Latvia. Many were barred from working in certain professions or returning to their homes.

Soon after the death of Stalin, a number of Latvians in the Communist Party began to increase. By this time many locally-born communists had achieved positions of power and began advocating a program that centered on ending the inflow of Russian-speaking immigrants, ending the growth of heavy industry, and creating light industries better suited for local needs, increasing the role and power of the locally born communists, enforcing the Latvian language as the &quot;state language&quot;. This group was led by Eduards Berklavs, who in 1957 became the vice-chairman of the Council of Ministers. Orders were issued that non-Latvian Communists should learn some Latvian or lose their jobs within two years.

They were opposed by the &quot;Russian Latvian&quot; communists who had been born to Latvian parents in Russia or the Soviet Union, had returned to Latvia only after World War II, and usually did not speak or avoided speaking Latvian in public. They were supported by the politically influential officer corps of the Baltic Military District. In 1958 Soviet education made learning national languages optional.

In April 1959, a fact-finding delegation from Soviet Central Committee visited Riga. During Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s visit to Riga in June 1959, hard-line elements complained about the nationalist tendencies in the Party and, with the blessing from Moscow, started purges of national communists and local communists, who had been in power since 1940. In November 1959, the long-serving First Secretary of the Party Kalnbērziņš and Prime Minister Vilis Lācis resigned from their posts and were replaced by hardliners. During the next three years, some 2,000 national communists were dismissed from their positions and moved to insignificant posts in the countryside or Russia.

The first post-war census in 1959 showed that the number of Latvians since 1935 had declined by 170,000, while Russians had increased by 388,000, Belarusians by 35,000, and Ukrainians by 28,000.

Because Latvia had still maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists, it was decided in Moscow that some of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most advanced manufacturing factories were to be based in Latvia. New industries were created in Latvia, including a major machinery factory RAF, and electrotechnical factories, along with some food and oil processing plants. TV broadcasts from Riga started in 1954, the first in the Baltics.

==Era of Pelše, 1959–1966==
From 1959 to 1962, leading Latvian national communists were purged as Arvīds Pelše enforced his power.

In 1961, Pelše officially banned the Latvian midsummer Jāņi celebrations along with other Latvian traditions and folk customs. In November 1959 Pelše also instigated the purge of &quot;nascent nationalists&quot; from the Latvian government. Almost 2,000 members of the government were removed.

Between 1959 and 1968, nearly 130,000 Russian speakers immigrated to Latvia and began working in the large industrial factories that were rapidly built. The newly arrived immigrants were the first to receive apartments in the newly built micro-districts. Large factories, employing tens of thousands of recently arrived immigrants, and entirely dependent on resources from faraway Soviet regions, produced products – most of which were sent back to other Soviet republics. Many of the new factories were under the All-Union ministry and military jurisdiction, thus operating outside the planned economy of Soviet Latvia. Latvia&#x27;s VEF and Radiotehnika factories specialized in producing radios, telephones and sound systems. Most of the Soviet railway carriages were made by Rīgas Vagonbūves Rūpnīca and minibuses by Riga Autobus Factory.

In 1962, Riga began receiving Russian gas for industrial needs and domestic heating. This allowed large-scale construction of new micro-districts and high-rises to begin. In 1965, the Pļaviņas Hydroelectric Power Station began producing electricity.

==Era of Voss, 1966–1984==

Since there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories and expand industrial production, workers outside the Latvian SSR (mainly Russians) were transferred into the country, noticeably decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians. The speed of Russification was also influenced by the fact that Riga was the HQ of the Baltic Military District, with active and retired Soviet officers moving there.

Increased investments and subsidies for collective farms greatly increased the living standards of the rural population without much increase in production output. Much of the farm produce was still grown on small private plots. To improve rural living standards, a mass campaign was started to liquidate individual family farms and to move people into smaller agricultural towns where they were given apartments. Farmers became paid workers in collective farms.

While the early Voss era continued with the modernizing impulse of the 1960s, a visible stagnation began by the mid-1970s. Prestige high-rise projects in Riga, such as the Hotel Latvija and the Ministry of Agriculture building, took many years to complete. A new international airport and the Vanšu Bridge over Daugava were built.

An ideological model of &quot;live and let live&quot; came into place. The black market, absenteeism, and alcoholism became widespread. Consumer goods shortages became normal.

==Era of Pugo, 1984–1988==
===National reawakening, 1985–1990===

In the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev began the introduction of the political and economic reforms of glasnost and Perestroika. In the summer of 1987, large demonstrations were held in Riga at the Freedom Monument. In the summer of 1988, a national movement coalesced in the Popular Front of Latvia. The Latvian SSR, along with the other Baltic Republics, was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988 the old national flag of Latvia was legalized, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990. Pro-independence Latvian Popular Front candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the Supreme Council in the March 1990 democratic elections.

==Collapse of the Soviet rule==

On 4 May 1990, the Council passed the declaration &quot;On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia,&quot; which declared the Soviet annexation void and announced the start of a transitional period to independence. It argued that the 1940 occupation violated international law. It also argued that the 1940 resolution acceding to the Soviet Union was illegal since the 1922 Latvian constitution stipulated that any major change in the state order had to be submitted to a referendum. In any case, the declaration argued that the 1940 elections were conducted based on an illegal and unconstitutional election law, which rendered all actions of the &quot;People&#x27;s Saeima&quot; &quot;ipso facto&quot; void. On these bases, the Supreme Council argued that the Republic of Latvia, as proclaimed in 1918, still legally existed even though its sovereignty had been &quot;de facto&quot; lost in 1940.

Latvia took the position that it did not need to follow the process of secession delineated in the Soviet constitution, arguing that since the annexation was illegal and unconstitutional, it was merely reasserting independence that still existed under international law. However, the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic from 1990 to 1991. In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces unsuccessfully tried to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions. During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia. Despite this, seventy-three percent of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 March 1991 in a non-binding advisory referendum. A large number of ethnic Russians also voted for the proposition. The Republic of Latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored complete independence on 21 August 1991 in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt. Latvia, as well as Lithuania and Estonia de facto ceased to be parts of the USSR four months before the Soviet Union itself ceased to exist (26 December 1991). Soon, on 6 September, the USSR recognized the independence of the three Baltic states. Today, the Republic of Latvia and other Baltic states consider themselves to be the legal continuation of the sovereign states whose first independent existence dates back to 1918–1940 and does not accept any legal connection with the former Latvian SSR, which had been occupied and annexed into USSR 1940–1941 and 1944–1991. Since independence, the Communist Party of the Latvian SSR was discontinued, and several high-ranking Latvian SSR officials faced prosecution for their role in various human rights abuses during the Latvian SSR regime. Latvia later joined NATO and the European Union in 2004.

== Economy ==
The Soviet period saw rebuilding and increase of the industrial capacity, including the automobile (RAF) and electrotechnic (VEF) factories, food processing industry, oil pipelines, and the bulk-oil port Ventspils.

Part of the incorporation of the Latvian SSR into the Soviet Union was the introduction of the Russian language into all spheres of public life. Russian became a prerequisite for admission to higher education and better job occupations. It was also made a compulsory subject in all Latvian schools. Vast numbers of people were needed for the new factories, and they were purposefully sent there from different parts of Russia, thus creating a situation wherein bigger towns became increasingly Russified until the 1980s.

National income per capita was higher in Latvia than elsewhere in the USSR (42% above the Soviet average in 1968); however, Latvia was at the same time a relative contributor to the Federation&#x27;s center with an estimated 0.5% of the Latvian GDP going to Moscow.
After the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse, all economic branches associated with it also collapsed. While a significant Russian presence in Latgale predated the Soviet Union (~30%), the intense industrialization and the heavy importation of labor from the Soviet Union to support it led to significant increases in the Russian minority in Riga, even forming a majority in Latvian urban centers such as Daugavpils, Rēzekne, and Ogre. Those areas were also hardest hit economically when the Soviet Union collapsed, leading to massive unemployment. Sharp disagreement with Russia over the legacy of the Soviet era has led to punitive economic measures by Russia, including the demise of transit trade as Russia cut off petroleum exports through Ventspils in 2003 (eliminating 99% of its shipments) after the government of Latvia refused to sell the oil port to the Russian state oil company, Transneft. The result is that only a fraction of Latvia&#x27;s economy is connected with Russia, especially after it joined the European Union.

In 2016, a committee of historians and economists published a report, &quot;Latvian Industry Before and After Restoration of Independence,&quot; estimating the overall cost of Soviet occupation in the years 1940–1990 at €185 billion, not counting the intangible costs of &quot;deportations and imprisonment policy&quot; of the Soviet authorities.

== Soviet army presence ==

The Red Army had been stationed in Latvia since October 1939, when it demanded and received military bases in Courland where it stationed at least 25,000 soldiers with plane, tank and artillery support. The Soviet Navy received rights to use ports in Ventspils and Liepāja. In addition to soldiers, uncontrolled numbers of officers&#x27; family members and construction workers arrived.

During the first year of Soviet power, construction of the new military aerodromes was begun, often involving the local population as unpaid construction workers. The Soviet Navy took over seaports and shipping yards. Many hundreds of Soviet officers were moved into newly nationalized apartments and houses. Larger apartments were subdivided, creating communal ones.

After 1944, Latvia and Riga became heavily militarized. demobilized soldiers and officers chose to move to Riga, creating severe housing shortages. Much of the new apartment building in the first post-war years was done only for the benefit of Soviet officers stationed in Riga.

Courland&#x27;s entire Baltic Sea coast became a Soviet border area with limited freedom of movement for the local inhabitants and closed to outsiders. Beaches were illuminated by searchlights and plowed to show any footprints. The old fishing villages became closed military zones, and fishermen were moved to larger townships: Roja, Kolka. The small coastal nation of Livonians virtually ceased to exist. Secretive objects were built like the Irbene radio telescope. Liepāja port was littered with rusting submarines and beaches with unexploded phosphorus.

By the mid-1980s, in addition to 350,000 soldiers of the Baltic Military District, an unknown number of border and interior ministry troops were stationed in the Baltics. In 1994 the departing Russian troops presented a list of over 3000 military units stationed in 700 sites taking over 120,000 ha, or about 2% of Latvian land.

In addition to active military personnel, Riga was popular as a retirement town for Soviet officers, who could not retire to larger cities like Moscow or Kyiv. Many thousands of them received preferential treatment in receiving new housing. To speed up the withdrawal of the Russian army, Latvia officially agreed to allow 20,000 retired Soviet officers and their families (up to 50,000 people) to remain in Latvia without granting them citizenship and Russia continues to pay them pensions.

Military training was provided by the Riga Higher Military Political School and the Riga Higher Military Aviation Engineering School.

== International status ==
The governments of the Baltic countries, the European Court of Human Rights, the United Nations Human Rights Council, the United States, and the European Union (EU), regard Latvia as being occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 under the provisions of the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The European Parliament in recognizing the occupation of the Baltic states from 1940 until the fall of the Soviet Union as illegal, led to the early acceptance of the Baltic states into the NATO alliance.

===Soviet sources before Perestroika===

Up to the reassessment of Soviet history in the USSR that began during Perestroika, before the USSR had condemned the 1939 secret protocol between Nazi Germany and itself that had led to the invasion and occupation of the three Baltic countries, the events in 1939 were as follows: The Government of the Soviet Union suggested that the Governments of the Baltic countries conclude mutual assistance treaties between the countries. Pressure from working people forced the governments of the Baltic countries to accept this suggestion. The Pacts of Mutual Assistance were then signed which allowed the USSR to station a limited number of Red Army units in the Baltic countries. Economic difficulties and dissatisfaction of the populace with the Baltic governments&#x27; policies that had sabotaged the fulfillment of the Pact and the Baltic countries&#x27; governments&#x27; political orientation toward Nazi Germany led to a revolutionary situation in June 1940. To guarantee the Pact&#x27;s fulfillment, additional military units entered Baltic countries, welcomed by the workers who demanded the resignations of the Baltic governments. In June, under the leadership of the Communist Parties, political demonstrations by workers were held. The fascist governments were overthrown, and workers&#x27; governments were formed. In July 1940, elections for the Baltic Parliaments were held. The &quot;Working People&#x27;s Unions,&quot; created by an initiative of the Communist Parties, received the majority of the votes. The Parliaments adopted the declarations of the restoration of Soviet powers in Baltic countries and proclaimed the Soviet Socialist Republics. Declaration of Estonia&#x27;s, Latvia&#x27;s and Lithuania&#x27;s wishes to join the USSR were adopted, and the Supreme Soviet of the USSR petitioned accordingly. The Supreme Soviet of the USSR approved the requests.

===Current position of the Russian government===
The Russian government and officials maintain that the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states was legitimate and that the Soviet Union liberated the countries from the Nazis.

<doc id="380351" wikidata="Q689645" url="?curid=380351" title="Culture of Switzerland">
<text>Switzerland lies at the crossroads of several major European cultures. Three of the continent&#x27;s major languages, German, French and Italian, are national languages of Switzerland, along with Romansh, spoken by a small minority. Therefore, Swiss culture is characterized by diversity, which is reflected in a wide range of traditional customs. The 26 cantons also account for the large cultural diversity.

Not withstanding the regional disparities, the Alps have played an essential role in shaping the history and culture of Switzerland. The region of the Gotthard Pass became the nucleus of the Swiss Confederacy in the early 14th century. Nowadays, all mountain areas of Switzerland have a strong skiing and mountaineering culture and are associated with folk arts such as the alphorn and yodeling. Other Swiss cultural icons include Swiss chocolate, Swiss cheese, watches, cowbells, banking, and the Swiss Army knives.
==Folk arts==

Folk art is kept alive in organizations all over the country. In Switzerland, it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. There are also many regional and local rites demarcating times of the year. Yodeling, despite being stereotypical for Switzerland, is not widespread and is limited to only some mountain areas. The same is true for the accordion, which is sometimes called by the name &quot;Schwiizerörgeli&quot;, implying that it was a Swiss musical instrument, rather than the German &quot;Handorgel&quot;.

The alphorn, or the alpenhorn, is a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood. The use of the alphorn is seen mainly in mountainous regions, can be very popular in some areas, and like yodeling or the accordion, it has become an emblem of traditional Swiss music.

The melodies of folk music vary between regions. Generally those in pastoral areas are floating and wide-ranging. In the inner and southern Alps, however, the melodies are more songlike, and of more limited range. Common and popular themes are about love and the homeland, but patriotic and pastoral themes, as well as hunting themes, are also commonplace.
The Alpine folk culture is characterized by very expressive dances. Small musical ensembles can be found in the more mountainous areas, particularly in the French-speaking part of Switzerland.

The most common form of woodcarving is chip carving. Such carving is normally for the decoration of everyday objects, such as milk stools, neckbands for bells, wooden spoons, or walking sticks. Figure carving is also common, particularly of Nativity figures. In some areas, the façades of houses are richly decorated using woodcarving. This is widespread in the Bernese Oberland region where Protestant Christianity predominates. In Roman Catholic regions, this is far less common.

Embroidery is common on traditional clothing, particularly women&#x27;s clothing. Embroidery is often limited to prominent points, such as cuffs, hats and scarves. Embroidery is also used for the decoration of fabric. In the past, embroidery was a home industry in the northeast and the east of Switzerland. Nowadays, embroidery is confined to tourism, as traditional clothes are no longer in use.

On certain autumn nights, children&#x27;s processions with lanterns are common in Alemannic Switzerland. Lanterns (called &quot;&quot; &quot;turnip light&quot;) are hand-carved from root vegetables, generally turnips, by removing the interior and putting a candle inside. The &quot;Räbeliechtli&quot; is carved with designs such as the traditional sun, moon and stars. The lantern is then suspended by three chains. The children walk through the streets of their town with the lanterns and sing traditional songs. The custom originates with thanksgiving traditions at the end of harvest in November. This tradition is very similar to the tradition of carving turnip lanterns for halloween in Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man (where they call halloween Hop-tu-Naa, and have traditional songs), and parts of England and Wales. There the celebration is on 31 October to celebrate the eve of the Celtic New Year.

==Architecture==

There is a strong architectural tradition in Switzerland. The Romanesque style of the 12th century can be found in the cathedrals of Basel, Sion, Chur, Geneva, Zürich and Schaffhausen. This style, which is rich in expression, can also be found on many castles and fortresses around the country, many of which preserved in a good condition. The cathedrals of Lausanne and Bern are in the Gothic style, and the churches of Einsiedeln and St. Gallen are in the Baroque style.

During the Renaissance, a large number of architectural masters gave their talents to Italy. Most of these came from the southern canton of Ticino. The Prisons near the &quot;Doge&#x27;s Palace&quot; in Venice and the Rialto Bridge in Venice were built by Antonio da Ponte. The &quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot; in Venice was built by Antonio Contino, and Domenico Fontana (1543–1607) designed the entire &quot;Lateran Palace&quot; in Naples as well as the façade of the &quot;St. John Lateran Church&quot; and the &quot;Royal Palace&quot; in the same city. Fontana&#x27;s nephew Carlo Maderno was an architect to Pope Paul V. &quot;San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane&quot;, the gallery of the &quot;Palazzo Spada&quot; and the &quot;Filippini monastery&quot; were built by Francesco Borromini, and Carlo Fontana was responsible for the façade of &quot;San Marcello al Corso&quot; and the &quot;Montecitorio Palace&quot;; Baldassare Longhena, from Maroggia, built the church of &quot;Santa Maria della Salute&quot;, the &quot;Rezzonico&quot; and the &quot;Widmann&quot; palaces; all in Venice.
Gilardi and Oldelli families from Ticino set up architecture practices in Russia. Giovanni Giliardi built The Orphanage in Moscow, and his son Domenico Giliardi was in charge of the rebuilding Moscow public buildings, including the University, after the Great Fire of 1812. Domenico Trezzini built many places in St. Petersburg by the orders of Peter the Great; Pietro Trezzini (not related to Domenico) continued the tradition in the 1740s. 

Early in the 20th century, a new movement, called the Style Sapin, was created by the architect and painter Charles l&#x27;Eplattenier in the city of La Chaux-de-Fonds. It was a variation of Art Nouveau, and it became popularly known as the &quot;Style Sapin&quot;, or pine tree style, since l&#x27;Eplatennier insisted that the best model for art and architecture in the region was the pine tree, along with the other native plants and trees of the Jura mountains. Le Corbusier (Charles-Edouard Jeanneret), was a student of l&#x27;Eplattenier, and at the age of eighteen built his first house, a chalet with a pine tree decorative design, in La Chaux-de-Fonds. He became a major force in western modern architecture in the 20th century.

Distinctive architecture of high quality can be found around Switzerland. It is often considered as particularly innovative modern architecture. Mario Botta is a famous architect who influenced modern architecture. The architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron from Basel received the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2001, in 2009 the prize was awarded to Swiss architect Peter Zumthor, and in 2021, Anne Lacaton a Professor at ETH Zurich, won the prize with her partner Jean-Philippe Vassal.

==Visual arts==

In the 16th century Protestantism had a strong influence on visual arts in Switzerland. Samuel Hieronymus Grimm was a well-known 18th-century watercolourist and ink wash artist, although he created much of his notable work while in England. There was almost no influence from Italian or French Renaissance. Chiefly in modern times did Swiss artists begin to emerge internationally. Alberto Giacometti is said to have derived much of his inspiration from the Etruscans, but became internationally known. Jean Tinguely fascinated people from all over the world with complex moving sculptures constructed entirely from scrap materials. Paul Klee is sometimes regarded as Switzerland&#x27;s most original and impressive painter.

The Dada movement originated in the Cabaret Voltaire in Zürich in 1916.

Despite the relatively small number of internationally famous artists such as Alberto Giacometti and HR Giger, there are considerable art collections in renowned museums around Switzerland. These are not only found in the cities of Zürich, Basel and Geneva but also in smaller towns such as Schaffhausen, Martigny and Winterthur. The museums in the smaller towns pride themselves for their contribution to the arts, which exceed what is commonly found in provincial areas.

Graphic arts flourish in Switzerland, as does creative photography. Examples of this can be found on calendars, magazines and outdoor billboard advertisements.

==Literature==

In the field of literature Switzerland produced a number of very well known writers. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was from Geneva. The critic and historian Jacob Burckhardt was from Basel. The house of Germaine de Staël in Coppet was a centre of European literary life during the 18th century. Other writers include Gottfried Keller, Conrad Ferdinand Meyer, Jeremias Gotthelf and Charles Ferdinand Ramuz. Hermann Hesse and Carl Spitteler both won a Nobel Prize for their works.

In the 20th century the plays of Friedrich Dürrenmatt and Max Frisch impressed readers beyond the borders of Switzerland. There are a great number of regional dialects, especially in the German language. Even though standard German is commonly used for writing, there is a living dialect literature in many areas.

For children&#x27;s culture there is the cartoon character Globi.

==Music==
Switzerland is not commonly considered a leading musical nation. However, in the 20th century it produced a number of notable composers, such as Arthur Honegger, Othmar Schoeck and Frank Martin, who have all gained international renown. Lucerne and Verbier both feature prestigious international classical music festivals in the summer: the Lucerne Festival and the Verbier Festival. Other places have similar festivals, ranging from country and western to pop and jazz. The Montreux Jazz Festival is particularly well known.

Swiss composer and musician Andreas Vollenweider gained worldwide recognition with his harp music and has received a Grammy Award, followed by two Grammy nominations, one as recent as 2007. His 17 instrumental albums have sold over 15 million copies.

==Media==
Newspapers have a strong regional character, but some are renowned for their thorough coverage of international issues, such as the of Zürich and &quot;Le Temps&quot; of Geneva. As elsewhere, television plays a great role in modern cultural life in Switzerland. The national public broadcaster, SRG SSR idée suisse, offers three networks, one each for the German, French and Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland. In the German-speaking part, television from Germany is popular, as is television from France in the French-speaking part and television from Italy in the Italian-speaking part. American movies and television series are influential in all areas.

In film, American productions constitute most of the programme, although several Swiss movies have enjoyed commercial successes in recent years. Maybe due to the multilingual culture, almost all movie theatres play movies in their original language with subtitles, and films on television are often broadcast in original and synchronized versions.

== Banking ==
Switzerland has been associated with banking and other related banking services. Since the early 18th century, Switzerland has a long, kindred history of banking secrecy and client confidentiality. Started as a way to protect wealthy European banking interests, Swiss banking secrecy was codified with the 1934 Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks. Considered the &quot;grandfather of bank secrecy&quot;, has been one of the largest offshore financial centers and tax havens in the world since the mid-20th century. Following an international push to roll back banking secrecy laws, Switzerland has seen fluctuating levels of banking regulation. 

Releasing client information has been considered a serious social and criminal offence since the early 1900s. Employees working in Switzerland and abroad at Swiss banks &quot;have long adhered to an unwritten code similar to that observed by doctors or priests&quot;. Banking in Switzerland has historically played, and still continues to play, a dominant role in the Swiss economy and society. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in 2015, total banking assets amount to 467% of total gross domestic product. Banking in Switzerland has been portrayed, to varying degrees of accuracy, in overall popular culture, books, movies, and television shows.

==Science==

There has been a long tradition of Swiss scientists ever since Paracelsus (real name &quot;Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim&quot;) in the 16th century. Paracelsus introduced the field of chemistry into medicine in the 16th century. The Bernoulli family from Basel is known for their significant contributions to mathematics over a time span of three generations. Leonhard Euler is another innovative mathematician. Horace-Bénédict de Saussure was a naturalist and pioneer in Alpine studies. The Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich has produced a great number of Nobel Prize winners, while the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Ferdinand de Saussure was an important contributor to the field of linguistics. Physicist Albert Einstein, born in Germany, moved to Switzerland in 1895 at the age of 16 and became a Swiss citizen in 1901.

==Leisure==

The close proximity to the mountains in all areas in Switzerland has greatly influenced the leisure of Swiss people. The growth of ski and mountaineering resorts in the Swiss mountains have caused the Swiss to become very sports conscious. Apart from skiing and mountaineering, Swiss-style wrestling (&quot;Schwingen&quot;) is still popular in rural areas. Sunday-morning shooting sessions and Hornussen (a kind of Alpine baseball) are two other traditional Swiss sports. Shooting, tennis, golf, ice hockey, football (soccer), basketball, handball, gliding, paragliding, sailing, swimming, volleyball, floorball, mountain biking, and hiking in the forests and mountains are all popular pastimes. Fishing is commonplace in the many lakes and rivers, but often a licence is necessary. Many mountain lakes freeze over during winter and are used for curling, horse and dog racing, particularly around St. Moritz. 

Lausanne is headquarters for many international sport organisations, notably the International Olympic Committee, the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. FIFA is headquartered in Zürich.
