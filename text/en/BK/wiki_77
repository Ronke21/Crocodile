<doc id="387937" wikidata="Q271521" url="?curid=387937" title="Tsugaru Strait">
<text>The is a strait between Honshu and Hokkaido in northern Japan connecting the Sea of Japan with the Pacific Ocean. It was named after the western part of Aomori Prefecture. The Seikan Tunnel passes under it at its narrowest point 12.1 miles (19.5 km) between Tappi Misaki on the Tsugaru Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture, Honshu, and Shirakami Misaki on the Matsumae Peninsula in Hokkaido.

Western maps made prior to the 20th century also referred to this waterway as the Strait of Sangar.

Japan&#x27;s territorial waters extend to three nautical miles (5.6 km) into the strait instead of the usual twelve, reportedly to allow nuclear-armed United States Navy warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan&#x27;s prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory. Despite this, the part of the Tsugaru Strait considered to be in international waters is still within Japan&#x27;s exclusive economic zone, and the Seikan Tunnel remains entirely under Japanese jurisdiction even though part of it is technically outside Japan&#x27;s territorial waters.

The Tsugaru Strait has eastern and western necks, both approximately 20 km across with maximum depths of 200 m and 140 m respectively.

There are also ferry services that operate across the strait, including the Tsugaru Kaikyō Ferry and the Seikan ferry.

On September 26, 1954, 1,172 people died when the ferry &quot;Tōya Maru&quot; sank in the strait.

Thomas Blakiston, an English explorer and naturalist, noticed that animals in Hokkaido were related to northern Asian species, whereas those on Honshu to the south were related to those from southern Asia. The Tsugaru Strait was therefore established as a major zoogeographical boundary, and became known as &quot;Blakiston&#x27;s Line&quot; or the &quot;Blakiston Line&quot;.

<doc id="387941" wikidata="Q1033874" url="?curid=387941" title="Cantor distribution">
<text>The Cantor distribution is the probability distribution whose cumulative distribution function is the Cantor function.

This distribution has neither a probability density function nor a probability mass function, since although its cumulative distribution function is a continuous function, the distribution is not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure, nor does it have any point-masses. It is thus neither a discrete nor an absolutely continuous probability distribution, nor is it a mixture of these. Rather it is an example of a singular distribution.

Its cumulative distribution function is continuous everywhere but horizontal almost everywhere, so is sometimes referred to as the Devil&#x27;s staircase, although that term has a more general meaning.

== Characterization ==

The support of the Cantor distribution is the Cantor set, itself the intersection of the (countably infinitely many) sets:
: formula_1

The Cantor distribution is the unique probability distribution for which for any &quot;C&quot;&quot;t&quot; (&quot;t&quot; ∈ { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }), the probability of a particular interval in &quot;C&quot;&quot;t&quot; containing the Cantor-distributed random variable is identically 2−&quot;t&quot; on each one of the 2&quot;t&quot; intervals.

== Moments ==
It is easy to see by symmetry and being bounded that for a random variable &quot;X&quot; having this distribution, its expected value E(&quot;X&quot;) = 1/2, and that all odd central moments of &quot;X&quot; are 0.

The law of total variance can be used to find the variance var(&quot;X&quot;), as follows. For the above set &quot;C&quot;1, let &quot;Y&quot; = 0 if &quot;X&quot; ∈ [0,1/3], and 1 if &quot;X&quot; ∈ [2/3,1]. Then:

: formula_2

From this we get:

:formula_3

A closed-form expression for any even central moment can be found by first obtaining the even cumulants

:formula_4

where &quot;B&quot;2&quot;n&quot; is the 2&quot;n&quot;th Bernoulli number, and then expressing the moments as functions of the cumulants.

<doc id="387943" wikidata="Q2341224" url="?curid=387943" title="2001 bomb plot in Europe">
<text>In 2001, a network of interconnected terrorist cells in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands was uncovered by law enforcement. The network had connections to al-Qaeda and was planning to commit one or more bombings.

== Plot ==
Three cells were involved: one in Rotterdam, one in Brussels, and one in a suburb of Paris. According to Djamel Beghal, Nizar Trabelsi planned to strap a bomb onto himself, cover it up with a business suit, and then detonate the bomb along with himself in the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Concurrently, a van packed with explosives would be detonated outside a U.S. cultural centre at the nearby Place de la Madeleine. Trabelsi denied this, but admitted that he had planned to commit a suicide bombing by detonating a car bomb next to the canteen at Kleine Brogel Air Base in Belgium. Trabelsi also said that he had met Osama bin Laden and personally requested to become a suicide bomber.

==Investigation==

Beghal was arrested on 28 July 2001 in Dubai as he was attempting to travel back to Europe on a false French passport after visiting an al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan. During interrogation, Beghal said that there was a plan to attack the U.S. Embassy in Paris and told investigators of terrorist cells in Rotterdam and Paris. He also said that Abu Zubaydah, a close associate of Osama bin Laden, had ordered the attack. After being extradited from the United Arab Emirates to France on 1 October 2001, Beghal retracted his confession, saying that it had been extracted using torture.
Surveillance of a suspected terrorist cell led by Kamel Daoudi in Corbeil-Essonnes near Paris started on 10 September. Following surveillance officers overhearing discussion of destroying evidence, French police moved in and arrested seven men on 21 September. Daoudi was not among the arrested, but he was shortly thereafter arrested in Leicester and extradited from the United Kingdom to France on 29 September 2001.
Dutch police started surveilling the Rotterdam cell in August. The four members of the cell were arrested on 13 September.
Police became aware of a connection between the Rotterdam cell and one led by Trabelsi in Brussels. Trabelsi and a Belgian Moroccan were arrested in two different areas of the Brussels metropolitan area on 13 September in an operation coordinated with the arrests in the Netherlands on the same day. At Trabelsi&#x27;s apartment, police found machine pistols, chemical formulas for bomb-making, detailed maps of the U.S. embassy in Paris, and a business suit. In a restaurant run by one of Trabelsi&#x27;s associates, police found materials that could have been used to make a bomb capable of blowing up a building.

==Legal proceedings==
In December 2002, four men were found not guilty of charges relating to the plot by a Dutch court, citing insufficient and improperly obtained evidence. Two of them, Jérôme Courtailler and Abdelghani Rabia, were convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; of belonging to a terrorist organization by an appellate court on 21 June 2004, and Courtailler turned himself in on 24 June.

Nizar Trabelsi was sentenced to ten years in prison by a Belgian court on 30 September 2003 for the attempted destruction of public property, illegal arms possession, and membership in a private militia, reflecting Belgium&#x27;s lack of specific anti-terrorism laws at the time. It was the largest terrorism trial the country had held up to that point; seventeen others were convicted of lesser offences and another five were acquitted. Trabelsi was extradited to the United States in 2013.

Six men were convicted of criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise by a French court on 15 March 2005; Djamel Beghal and Kamel Daoudi were sentenced to ten and nine years in prison, respectively, and the other four received sentences ranging from one to six years in prison. Beghal was released in 2010. Daoudi was released from prison in 2008, whereupon he was to be deported to Algeria. However, the European Court of Human Rights blocked the order, and he was instead placed under house arrest.

<doc id="387948" wikidata="Q1047128" url="?curid=387948" title="Iga Province">
<text>was a province of Japan located in what is today part of western Mie Prefecture. Its abbreviated name was . Iga is classified as one of the provinces of the Tōkaidō. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Iga was ranked as an &quot;inferior country&quot; ( &quot;gekoku&quot;) and a &quot;near country&quot; ( &quot;kingoku&quot;). 

Iga was bordered by Ise to the east and south, Ōmi to the north, Yamato to the west and south, and Yamashiro Province to the northwest. It roughly coincides with the modern municipalities of Iga and Nabari in Mie Prefecture as well as Yagyu in Nara Prefecture. Surrounded by mountains, historically, Iga Province was rather inaccessible due to extremely poor road conditions. However, the area is now relatively easy to access from nearby Nara and Kyoto, as well as the larger cities of Osaka and Nagoya.

==History==
===Asuka period===
Iga was separated from Ise Province during the Asuka period, around 680 AD. The provincial capital was located in what is now part of the city of Iga, along with the ruins of the Iga Kokubun-ji. The &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Aekuni Shrine, which is also located in what is now part of the city of Iga.

===Heian, Kamakura and Muromachi periods===

Little is known of the subsequent history of the province during the Heian and Kamakura periods. However, by the middle of the Muromachi period, Iga became effectively independent from its nominal feudal rulers and established a confederacy, &quot;Iga Sokoku Ikki&quot;. During this period, Iga came to be known as a center for ninja activity. This serves that basis of its claim, along with Kōka in what is now Shiga Prefecture, to be one of the birthplaces of the ninja clans and &quot;ninjutsu&quot;.

In 1581, two years after a failed invasion led by his son, the warlord Oda Nobunaga launched a massive invasion of Iga, attacking from six directions with a force of 40,000 to 60,000 men which effectively destroyed the political power of the ninja (see the Tenshō Iga War).

===Tokugawa shogunate===
With the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Iga was briefly (1600–1608) under the control of Iga-Ueno Domain, a 200,000-&quot;koku&quot; &quot;han&quot; during the rule of Tsutsui Sadatsugu, a former retainer of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, the Tsutsui clan was dispossessed in 1608, and the territory of the domain was given to Tōdō Takatora, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Tsu Domain. It remained a part of Tsu Domain until the Meiji Restoration.

===Edo period===
Notable Edo-period people from Iga included the famous samurai Hattori Hanzō and the haiku poet Matsuo Bashō. Iga Ueno Castle was retained by Tsu Domain as a secondary administrative center for the western portion of the domain.

===Mie Prefecture===
After the abolition of the han system in July 1871, Tsu Domain became &quot;Tsu Prefecture&quot;, which later became part of Mie Prefecture.

==Historical districts==
Iga was divided into 4 Districts (郡), which were further subdivided into 197 villages. The total assessed value of the province in terms of &quot;kokudaka&quot; was 110,843 &quot;koku&quot;.
* Ahai District () – merged with Yamada District to become Ayama District (阿山郡) on March 29, 1896
* Iga District () – merged with Nabari District to become Naga District (名賀郡) on March 29, 1896

<doc id="387960" wikidata="Q1156791" url="?curid=387960" title="Copying">
<text>Copying is the duplication of information or an based on an instance of that information or artifact, and not using the process that originally generated it. With analog forms of information, copying is only possible to a limited degree of accuracy, which depends on the quality of the equipment used and the skill of the operator. There is some inevitable generation loss, deterioration and accumulation of &quot;noise&quot; (random small changes) from original to copy when copies are made. This deterioration accumulates with each generation. With digital forms of information, copying is perfect. Copy and paste is frequently used by a computer user when they select and copy an area of text or content.

==In art==

In visual art, copying the works of the masters is a standard way that students learn to paint and sculpt. Often, artists will use the term &quot;after&quot; to credit the original artist in the title of the copy (regardless of how similar the two works appear) such as in Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;First Steps (after Millet)&quot; and Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Luncheon on the Grass, after Manet&quot; (based on Manet&#x27;s well-known work). In sculpture, copies have often been made using devices such as the pointing machine, the pantograph or, more recently, computer guided router systems that scan a model and can produce it in a variety of materials and in any desired size. Another way of copying three-dimensional works is by lost-wax casting and other forms of molding and casting.

==In literature==

Prior to the invention of the printing press, the only way to obtain a copy of a book was to copy it out by hand (see scrivener). Throughout the Middle Ages, monks copied entire texts as a way of disseminating and preserving literary, philosophical and religious texts.

==In office work==

Offices need more than one copy of a document in a number of situations. They usually need a copy of outgoing correspondence for their records. Sometimes they want to circulate copies of documents they create to several interested parties.

Until the late 18th century, if an office wanted to keep a copy of an outgoing letter, a clerk had to write out the copy by hand. This technology continued to be prevalent through most of the 19th century. For these purposes, offices employed copy clerks, also known as copyists, scribes, and scriveners.

A few alternatives to hand copying were invented between the mid-17th century and the late 18th century, but none had a significant impact on offices. In 1780 James Watt obtained a patent for letter copying presses, which James Watt &amp; Co. produced beginning in that year. Letter copying presses were used by the early 1780s by people like Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson. In 1785, Jefferson was using both stationary and portable presses made by James Watt &amp; Co.

During the 19th century, a host of competing technologies were introduced to meet office copying needs.
The technologies that were most commonly used in 1895 are identified in an 1895 description of the New York Business College&#x27;s course program: &quot;All important letters or documents are copied in a letter-book or carbon copies [are] made, and instruction is also given in the use of the mimeograph and other labor-saving office devices.&quot;

==Biological copying==

Organically, copying of genetic information can take place using DNA replication, which is able to copy and replicate the data with a high degree of accuracy, but mistakes are common, and occur in the form of mutations. However, in the process of DNA repair, many of the mistakes are corrected by checking the copied data against the original data.

==Digital copying==

The same principle is applied digitally, in devices such as in hard disks, but in a different form. The magnetised data on the disk consists of 1s and 0s. Unlike DNA, it only has two types of information, rather than four types, however, it still has a polar concept of transfer. In this case, the read-write head acts as an intermediary. A data section reading &quot;1&quot;, can only trigger one type of response, and &quot;0&quot; for the other. These responses from reading are converted into an electrical form that gets carried through the circuits. Although this can be later converted and processed for other ways of using the data, which can be modified, if a file was being copied from one hard disk to another, the principle ensures that the data is transferred with high fidelity, because only each type of signal can only trigger one type of data write, in this case, a 1 or a 0. This excludes exceptions where the data was written incorrectly or the existing data has been corrupted while on the disk such that no distinction can be made, but usually the hard disk returns the area as unreadable. The other concept that using digital copying is website copy, digital copying has more interpretation than just the basic concept of disk read and write itself. Digital Copy is a sample of interpretation of digital copying.

==Copying rights==
The concept of copying has a particular significance in certain areas of law. In each of the primary areas of intellectual property law, a number of cases have refined the question of what exactly constitutes the kind of copying prohibited by law, especially in areas such as copyright law.

A related concept is plagiarism, copying others&#x27; work and passing it off as one&#x27;s own.
Many schools will take plagiarism to academic suspension, or even the failure of a course.

<text>Cutting is the separation or opening of a physical object, into two or more portions, through the application of an acutely directed force.

Implements commonly used for are the knife and saw, or in medicine and science the scalpel and microtome. However, any sufficiently sharp object is capable of cutting if it has a hardness sufficiently larger than the object being cut, and if it is applied with sufficient force. Even liquids can be used to cut things when applied with sufficient force (see water jet cutter).

Cutting is a compressive and shearing phenomenon, and occurs only when the total stress generated by the cutting implement exceeds the ultimate strength of the material of the object being cut. The simplest applicable equation is:

:formula_1 or formula_2

The stress generated by a cutting implement is directly proportional to the force with which it is applied, and inversely proportional to the area of contact. Hence, the smaller the area (i.e., the sharper the cutting implement), the less force is needed to cut something. It is generally seen that cutting edges are thinner for cutting soft materials and thicker for harder materials. This progression is seen from kitchen knife, to cleaver, to axe, and is a balance between the easy cutting action of a thin blade vs strength and edge durability of a thicker blade.

==Metal cutting==

Cutting has been at the core of manufacturing throughout history. For metals many methods are used and can be grouped by the physical phenomenon used. It is the process of producing a work piece by removing unwanted material from a block of metal, in the form of chips.
* Chip forming (material removal processes) – sawing, drilling, milling, turning etc.
* Shearing – punching, stamping, scissoring, blanking
* Abrasive material removal – grinding, lapping, polishing, water-jet
* Heat – flame cutting, plasma cutting, laser cutting
* Electrochemical – etching, electrical discharge machining (EDM), electrochemical machining (ECM)

Every method has its limitations in accuracy, cost, and effect on the material. For example, heat may damage the quality of heat treated alloys, and laser cutting is less suitable for highly reflective materials such as aluminum. Laser cutting sheet metal produces flat parts and etches and engraves parts from complex or simple designs. It is used over other cutting options for its quick process and customizable abilities.

<doc id="387969" wikidata="Q1434251" url="?curid=387969" title="Legio VI Victrix">
<text>Legio VI Victrix (&quot;Victorious Sixth Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army founded in 41 BC by the general Octavian (who, as Augustus, later became Rome&#x27;s first emperor). It was the twin legion of VI &quot;Ferrata&quot; and perhaps held veterans of that legion, and some soldiers kept to the traditions of the Caesarian legion.

==In Republican service==
The legion saw its first action in Perusia in 41 BC. It also served against Sextus Pompeius, who occupied Sicily and made threats to discontinue sending grain to Rome. In 31 BC the legion fought in the Battle of Actium against Mark Antony.

==In Imperial service==
===VI &quot;Victrix&quot; in Spain===
The legion took part in the final stage of the Roman conquest of Hispania, participating in Augustus&#x27; major war against the Cantabrians, from 29 BC to 19 BC, that brought all of the Iberian Peninsula under Roman rule.

The legion stayed in Spain for nearly a century and received the surname &quot;Hispaniensis&quot;, founding the city of &quot;Legio&quot; (modern-day León). Soldiers of this unit and X &quot;Gemina&quot; numbered among the first settlers of Caesaraugusta, what became modern-day Zaragoza. The cognomen &quot;Victrix&quot; (Victorious) dates back to the reign of Nero. But Nero was unpopular in the area, and when the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, Galba, said he wished to overthrow Nero, the legion supported him and he was proclaimed Emperor in the VI &quot;Victrix&quot; legionary camp. Galba created VII &quot;Gemina&quot; and marched on Rome, where Nero killed himself.

===VI &quot;Victrix&quot; in Germany===
For a brief period (approximately 110 AD to 119), the legion was stationed along the Rhine river in the province of Germania Inferior.

===VI &quot;Victrix&quot; in Britain===


In 119, Hadrian relocated the legion to northern Britannia, to assist those legions already present in quelling the resistance there. &quot;Victrix&quot; was key in securing victory, and would eventually replace the diminished IX &quot;Hispana&quot; at Eboracum. In 122 the legion started work on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall which would sustain the peace for two decades.

Twenty years later, they helped construct the Antonine Wall and its forts such as Castlecary and Croy Hill but it was largely abandoned by 164. In 2020 a replica of the Eastermains stone was installed in Twechar. The original was found on Eastermains Farm (which adjoins Whitehill), west of Inchbelly Bridge, east of Kirkintilloch and is often associated with Auchendavy. It has been scanned and a video produced. It is similar to two other distance slabs of the Sixth Legion on the Antonine Wall.

In 175, the Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, defeated the Iazyges tribe of Sarmatians. He took them into Roman service and settled 5,500 of them in Britain; it has been claimed without evidence and contrary to legionary recruitment practices that some were assigned to Legio VI Victrix based in York. The only detachment attested in Britain is a unit at Ribchester, south of Lancaster. Less certain is evidence from Bainesse, near Catterick, where lost tiles apparently stamped BSAR may be evidence for the presence of a Sarmatian unit there.

Legio VI was awarded the honorary title &quot;Britannica&quot; by Commodus in AD 184 following his own adoption of the title. 

In 185, the British legions mutinied and put forward one legate Priscus, a commander of their own (about whom little other information is known, but possibly Caerellius Priscus), to replace the unpopular Emperor Commodus, but the former declined. The mutiny was suppressed by Pertinax, who would later become emperor himself after Commodus was murdered.

The large fort at Carpow in Scotland was occupied from about 184 by Legio VI who completed the fort with the principia and praetorium which they roofed with tiles bearing their new cognomen.

The Legate of the legion in the late second century, Claudius Hieronymianus, dedicated a temple to Serapis in Eboracum in advance of the arrival of Septimius Severus in AD208.

An altar to Hercules was dedicated by Gaius Vitellius Atticianus, Centurion of the Legio VI Victrix, at Whitley Castle (Epiacum), illustrated above left.

<text>Saturn-Apollo 3 (SA-3) was the third flight of the Saturn I launch vehicle, the second flight of Project Highwater, and part of the American Apollo program. The rocket was launched on November 16, 1962, from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

== History ==

The Saturn I launch vehicle components were delivered to Cape Canaveral by the barge &quot;Promise&quot; on September 19, 1962, but erection of the first-stage booster onto its launch pedestal was delayed until September 21 due to a tropical depression that moved over the Florida peninsula. The dummy second and third stages (S-IV and S-V) and payload were assembled on the booster on September 24. Ballast water was loaded into the dummy stages on October 31, and the RP-1 fuel was loaded on November 14.

For this launch, Cape Canaveral director Kurt Debus asked Marshall Space Flight Center director Wernher von Braun, who was overseeing the Saturn project, that no outside visitors be allowed on NASA grounds due to the ongoing tensions of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

== Flight ==

Saturn-Apollo 3 was launched at 17:45:02 on November 16, 1962, from Launch Complex 34. The only hold in the countdown sequence was for 45 minutes due to a power failure in ground support equipment. This mission was the first time the Saturn I rocket was launched with a full load of propellant, carrying approximately of fuel.

The vehicle&#x27;s four inner H-1 engines shut down at 2 minutes 21.66 seconds after launch and an altitude of , and its four outer engines shut down at 2 minutes 29.09 seconds and ; both sets burned slightly longer than was initially estimated, reaching a maximum velocity of . The vehicle continued to coast to an altitude of and range of , at which point, 4 minutes 52 seconds after launch, officials sent a terminate command to the rocket, setting off several charges which caused the dummy stages of the vehicle to destruct. The first stage remained intact, though uncontrolled, until it impacted the Atlantic Ocean around from its launch site.

== Objectives ==

=== Primary ===

The main objectives of SA-3 were much the same as the previous two Saturn I flights in that it was primarily a test of the first-stage booster (S-I) and its H-1 engines. According to the NASA report &quot;Results of the Third Saturn 1 Launch Vehicle Test Flight&quot;, SA-3 aimed to test four areas: the booster, the ground support equipment, the vehicle in flight, and Project Highwater.

The test of the booster involved the propulsion system, structural design, and control systems. The ground support test involved the facilities and equipment used in the launch, including propellant systems, automatic checkout equipment, launch platform, and support towers. The vehicle in flight test measured aeroballistics, which confirmed values of aerodynamic characteristics such as stability and performance; propulsion, which ensured the engines could provide enough thrust to propel the vehicle at the correct velocity and trajectory, as well as provide data on the performance of all eight engines during flight; structural and mechanical, which provided measurements of the vehicle&#x27;s stress and vibration levels through all phases of flight; and guidance and control, which demonstrated that spacecraft systems could accurately provide orientation and velocity information.

The fourth objective, Project Highwater, was an experiment previously flown on SA-2. This involved the intentional release of ballast water from the second and third stages which allowed scientists to investigate the nature of Earth&#x27;s ionosphere, as well as noctilucent clouds and the behavior of ice in space.

For Project Highwater, tanks in SA-3&#x27;s dummy upper stages were filled with of water, approximately , which was used to simulate the mass of future Saturn payloads. The water was divided roughly in half between the two dummy stages. When the terminate command was sent to the rocket, primacord charges split both stages longitudinally, instantly releasing its load of water. The experiment was tracked by cameras and other equipment on the ground and in aircraft. Observers at Cape Canaveral reported that the ice cloud was visible for about three seconds and was &quot;several miles across&quot;.

NASA declared all engineering goals of the flight as achieved, despite occasional issues with telemetry during flight and some measurement data being unusable or only partially usable. Project Highwater on SA-3 was also declared successful, though again, telemetry issues produced questionable results.

=== Special ===

The NASA &quot;Results&quot; report states that ten special tests were included in the SA-3 flight, all focused on technologies and procedures intended for use on future Apollo missions.

;Propulsion
As mentioned earlier, SA-3 was the first Apollo flight to carry a full load of propellant, compared to earlier flights that carried approximately 83% of maximum capacity. This had the effect of testing the rocket&#x27;s reaction to slower acceleration and extended first stage flight time. Also on this mission, the outboard engines were allowed to fire until depletion of the rocket&#x27;s liquid oxygen (LOX), rather than the timed cut-offs of previous flights.

SA-3 also featured the first use of retrorockets on Apollo hardware. These were the only functional part on SA-3 of what would become the S-I/S-IV stage separation system, which would separate the two stages in later missions. These four small solid rockets were located 90 degrees apart around the top of the S-I stage, with their nozzles aimed up. At 2 minutes 33.66 seconds after launch, the rockets fired for about 2.1 seconds. A minor misalignment of the rockets caused a 4.3 degree per second roll of the vehicle, which caused the spacecraft&#x27;s ST-90 and ST-124P inertial platforms to fail after 15 degrees of rotation. This was considered incidental to the flight and did not impact mission success.

;Instrumentation
The ST-124P inertial platform (&#x27;P&#x27; for prototype) was a component of the guidance and control system, and contained gyroscopes and accelerometers that fed information to control computers. Once out of the atmosphere, this information provided steering signals to the gimbaled engines. During SA-3, this platform was an inactive component; while functioning and monitored during the flight, it had no control over the vehicle, and was used only to compare performance with the then-standard ST-90 platform, which was also an inactive component for the flight. For this mission, both platforms were located on the interstage between S-I and S-IV; Saturn IB and Saturn V vehicles would have one on the Instrument Unit atop the S-IVB stage.

Two new transmitters were included on SA-3. The pulse code modulated (PCM) data link transmitted digital data, which would be vital to providing automated spacecraft checkout and launch procedures on future flights. The unit operated with high signal strength, indicating that it would provide very accurate data. An ultra high frequency (UHF) radio link was also tested on SA-3. It would be used to transmit sensor measurements which could not be effectively transmitted at lower frequencies. The system performed satisfactorily, and post-flight documentation indicated engineers may expand its role for future telemetry transmission.

A Block II antenna panel was tested during flight. Located between propellant tanks, it provided stronger and more consistent signal strength than the Block I panel.

Temperature measurements of the S-IV dummy stage and interstage fairing were carried out with eighteen temperature probes, called thermocouples. These were used to detect temperature changes around protuberances on the stage&#x27;s skin and in the area of the retrorockets during operation. For the S-IV stage, temperatures were within expected levels, though a heating rate around twice that predicted was encountered. On the interstage, during retrorocket firing, a maximum temperature of was seen, indicating something unknown may have caused an abnormally high reading.

;Engineering and ground equipment
A single panel of Block II M-31 heat shield insulation, along with one of the spacecraft&#x27;s calorimeters, was mounted on the base of the first stage by the engines. This test measured heat flux through the new insulation compared to the material normally used on Saturn I Block I flights.

A dynamic pressure study was conducted for the Centaur program, in which two aluminum panels were mounted to the payload adapter atop the S-V stage and equipped with 11 pressure sensors. This study was performed due to the failure of the first Centaur vehicle flown, suspected to result from an adverse pressure environment around the shoulder of the vehicle. The test found that a very low pressure region formed just behind the shoulder while the vehicle was at Mach 0.7.

Finally, a new umbilical tower and Block II swing arm were used for the first time in preparation for future Block II Saturn I flights.

<doc id="387981" wikidata="Q596458" url="?curid=387981" title="President of the Church">
<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, the President of the Church is generally considered to be the highest office of the church. It was the office held by Joseph Smith, founder of the movement, and the office assumed by many of Smith&#x27;s claimed successors, such as Brigham Young, Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Several other titles have been associated with this office, including First Elder of the church, Presiding High Priest, President of the High Priesthood, Trustee-in-Trust for the church, Prophet, Seer, Revelator, and Translator. Joseph Smith was known by all of these titles in his lifetime (although not necessarily with consistency).

Smith died in 1844 without having indisputably established who was to be his successor. Therefore, his death was followed by a succession crisis in which various groups followed leaders with succession claims. Years later, the office of President was reorganized in many of the resulting Latter Day Saint denominations, the largest of which are the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), and The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite). Some smaller denominations, such as the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), reject the office as an unscriptural creation.

==Joseph Smith: the first president==

The concept that the Church of Christ would have a single presiding officer arose in late 1831. Initially, after the church&#x27;s formation on April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith referred to himself as merely &quot;an apostle of Jesus Christ, and elder of the church.&quot; However, there was one other apostle—Oliver Cowdery—and several other elders of the church, making the formal hierarchy of the church unclear.

In September 1830, after Hiram Page claimed to have received revelations for the church, a revelation to Smith stated that &quot;no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations in this church excepting my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses.&quot; This established Smith&#x27;s exclusive right to lead the church.

In early June 1831, Smith was ordained to the &quot;high priesthood&quot;, along with twenty-two other men, including prominent figures in the Latter Day Saint movement such as Hyrum Smith, Parley P. Pratt, and Martin Harris. As &quot;high priests&quot;, these men were higher in the priesthood hierarchy than the elders of the church. However, it was still unclear whether Smith and Cowdery&#x27;s calling as apostles gave them superior authority than that of other high priests.

On November 11, 1831, a revelation to Smith stated that &quot;it must needs be that one be appointed of the high priesthood to preside over the Priesthood and he shall be called President of the high priesthood of the Church ... and again the duty of the President of the high priesthood is to preside over the whole church.&quot; Smith was ordained to this position and sustained by the church on January 25, 1832, at a conference in Amherst, Ohio.

In 1835, the &quot;Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ&quot; were revised, changing the phrase &quot;an ... elder of the church&quot; to &quot;the first elder of this Church.&quot; Thus, subsequent to 1835, Smith was sometimes referred to as the &quot;First Elder&quot; of the church. The 1835 revision also added a verse referring to the office of &quot;president of the high priesthood (or presiding elder)&quot;, which had since been added to the church hierarchy.

==Removal==

Though there has never been a popular movement in the church to have a president removed or punished, he could theoretically be removed from his position or otherwise disciplined by the Common Council of the Church. The only president of the church brought before the Common Council was Joseph Smith, who was tried for charges made against him by Sylvester Smith after the return of Zion&#x27;s Camp in 1834. The Council determined that Joseph Smith had &quot;acted in every respect in an honorable and proper manner with all monies and properties entrusted to his charge.&quot;

==Prophet, seer, and revelator==
Prophet, seer, and revelator is an ecclesiastical title used in the Latter Day Saint movement. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is the largest denomination of the movement, and it currently applies these terms to the members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In the past, it has also been applied to the Presiding Patriarch of the church and the Assistant President of the Church. Other denominations of the movement also use these terms.

===Origin of the phrase===
The phrase &quot;prophet, seer, and revelator&quot; is derived from a number of revelations Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, said he received. The first revelation Smith said he received after the organization of the Church of Christ on April 6, 1830, declared that &quot;there shall be a record kept among you; and in it [Smith] shalt be called a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. In 1835, Smith further clarified the role of the President of the Church, &quot;to preside over the whole church, and ... to be a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet&quot;. In 1841, Smith recorded a revelation that again restated these roles: &quot;I give unto you my servant Joseph to be a presiding elder over all my church, to be a translator, a revelator, a seer, and prophet.&quot; In 1836, at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, approximately one year after Smith organized the church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he instructed that the members of the First Presidency and the apostles should also be accepted by the church as prophets, seers, and revelators:

I made a short address, and called upon the several quorums, and all the congregation of Saints, to acknowledge the Presidency as Prophets and Seers and uphold them by their prayers. ... I then called upon the quorums and congregation of Saints, to acknowledge the Twelve, who were present, as Prophets, Seers, Revelators, and special witnesses to all the nations of the earth holding the keys of the kingdom, to unlock it, or cause it to be done among them, and uphold them by their prayers.

Later, Smith further confirmed that people other than the President of the Church may hold these titles. For example, in 1841, a revelation described the role of Smith&#x27;s brother Hyrum Smith as Assistant President of the Church: &quot;And from this time forth I appoint unto him that he may be a prophet, and a seer, and a revelator unto my church, as well as my servant Joseph&quot;.

===Current usage within the LDS Church===
At the semiannual general conference of the LDS Church, the name of the President of the Church is presented to the members as &quot;prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;. Members are invited to sustain the president in these roles, and the signalling for any in opposition is also allowed. Additionally, the counselors in the First Presidency and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are sustained by the membership as &quot;prophets, seers, and revelators&quot;. Until October 1979, the Presiding Patriarch of the church was also sustained as a &quot;prophet, seer, and revelator&quot;. Apostles who are not members of the Quorum of the Twelve or the First Presidency and other general authorities, (e.g., members of the Quorums of the Seventy and Presiding Bishopric) are not sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators.

The procedure of sustaining is repeated in local congregations of the LDS Church several times per year at stake, district, ward, or branch conferences. These procedures are mandated by the theology of the LDS Church, which dictates governance by the &quot;common consent&quot; of the membership, wherein no one serves on the local or general level unless he or she has been formally sustained by individual congregations or the church as a whole.

==President of the LDS Church==

The President of the LDS Church is the church&#x27;s leader and the head of the First Presidency, the church&#x27;s highest governing body. Latter-day Saints consider the president of the church to be a &quot;prophet, seer, and revelator&quot;, and refer to him as &quot;the Prophet&quot;, a title originally given to Joseph Smith. When the name of the president is used by adherents, it is usually prefaced by the title &quot;President&quot;. Latter-day Saints consider the president of the church to be God&#x27;s spokesman to the entire world and the highest priesthood authority on earth, with the exclusive right to receive revelations from God on behalf of the entire church or the entire world. The President of the Church serves as the head of the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes and of the Council of the Church. The President of the Church also serves as the ex officio chairman of the Church Boards of Trustees/Education.

==Prophet-Presidents of the Community of Christ ==

In the Community of Christ, formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), the president of the church&#x27;s formal title is the &quot;Prophet-President&quot;. The Prophet-President is the highest priesthood leader of the church. The position is composed of several roles: (1) &quot;President of the Church&quot;, (2) &quot;President of the High Priesthood&quot; and (3) &quot;Prophet, Seer, and Revelator&quot; to the church.

As &quot;President of the Church&quot;, the Prophet-President is the church&#x27;s chief executive and is the leader of the First Presidency, the church&#x27;s chief executive council. As &quot;President of the High Priesthood&quot;, the Prophet-President is the church&#x27;s leading priesthood official. (Since the initiation of the ordination of women in 1985, it is now possible for this position to be filled by a woman, though all Prophet-Presidents to date have been men.) As &quot;Prophet, Seer, and Revelator&quot;, the Prophet-President is Community of Christ&#x27;s spiritual leader and can present revelations to the church to be added to the Doctrine and Covenants—an open canon of scripture, which stands with the Bible and the Book of Mormon as sacred text. In the church, only the Prophet-President is considered to be a prophet, seer, and revelator, and so far, each person to hold this position has presented additional revelations or spiritual writings to the church, which have been added to the Doctrine and Covenants.

===Succession to the Presidency===
Generally, the Prophet-President will name or ordain a successor prior to his death or retirement. The office was traditionally referred to as President of the High Priesthood. Prior to 1995, these successors had been chosen consistent with lineal succession, even though it was not a church rule. Accordingly, the first six Prophet-Presidents following movement founder Joseph Smith were his direct descendants.

In 1995, Wallace B. Smith broke with the precedent of lineal succession by naming W. Grant McMurray as his successor. In November 2004, McMurray resigned from the office of Prophet-President without naming a successor, citing medical and personal issues. The First Presidency, composed of McMurray&#x27;s two counselors, continued to function as the church&#x27;s chief executive council. A Joint Council of church leaders led by the Council of Twelve Apostles announced in March 2005 that Stephen M. Veazey would be Prophet-President designate. Veazey had been serving as president of the Council of Twelve. Delegates elected to a special World Conference of the church approved Veazey and he was ordained as the Prophet–President on June 3, 2005.

==Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints==
The Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints continued to believe in the lineal succession through the Jewish Laws of Inheritance. As such, the president of the Remnant Church following its formation, Frederick Niels Larsen, was a direct descendant (maternal 2nd great-grandson) of Joseph Smith, Jr. Following Larsen&#x27;s death in 2019, Terry W. Patience became President of the Remnant Church.

==President of The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)==
Similar to other denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement, in The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), the &quot;President of the General Church&quot; is also a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles.

==President of the Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)==
The tiny Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite), headquartered in Independence, Missouri, has a First Presidency with a President and two Counselors. Succession generally goes to the First Counselor at the time of the previous President&#x27;s death or resignation (no Cutlerite president has ever resigned), subject to approval of the church membership.

==President of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints==
In the earliest years of its existence, the Mormon fundamentalist Short Creek Community regarded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) as &quot;the only true and living church,&quot; viewing itself merely as a &quot;body of Priesthood&quot; set apart to perpetuate plural marriage and other &quot;crowning ordinances&quot; of the Gospel, such as the United Order. Hence, they tended to express a degree of admiration for contemporary LDS Church Presidents, while simultaneously insisting that they had compromised on serious matters and did not truly hold the &quot;keys of the Presidency of the Church,&quot; which had allegedly been returned to the spirit world at the death of Joseph F. Smith in 1918. Thus, they generally valued Church direction less than direct pronouncements from their own Priesthood Council. This &quot;Council of Friends&quot; consisted of seven &quot;High Priest Apostles&quot; or &quot;Presiding High Priests,&quot; the seniormost of whom was considered &quot;President of the Priesthood&quot; or Prophet.

Following LDS Church President Spencer W. Kimball&#x27;s 1978 Revelation on Priesthood, extending the right of ordination to black African males in perceived contradiction to the teachings of Brigham Young and other early LDS leaders, the fundamentalists in Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, began to regard their parent organization as a &quot;complete Gentile sectarian church.&quot; In 1991, Rulon Jeffs, by that time sole surviving member of the Priesthood Council and thus Prophet of the group, incorporated his followers into &quot;the Corporation of the President of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints&quot; or FLDS Church, with himself as president. Upon his death in 2002, Jeffs was succeeded by his First Counselor and son, Warren Jeffs. Despite the younger Jeffs&#x27; resignation from the Presidency in 2011 following his imprisonment for child sexual assault, and a brief tenure by Wendell Loy Nielsen as President of the Church&#x27;s corporate assets, most FLDS members continue to regard Jeffs as a prophet.

==Latter Day Saint sects without a President of the Church==
Some sects in the Latter Day Saint movement do not accept the office of President of the Church as a valid office in the priesthood; these groups often maintain that because Jesus&#x27; original church was led by twelve apostles, not by a president or a three-man presidency, the latter-day church should be similarly organized. For instance, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) is governed by a Quorum of the Twelve; the members of the quorum are generally regarded as co-equal holders of the highest office in the church.

<doc id="387985" wikidata="Q7083595" url="?curid=387985" title="Old Brick Capitol">
<text>The Old Brick Capitol in Washington, D.C., served as the temporary meeting place of the Congress of the United States from 1815 to 1819, while the Capitol Building was rebuilt after the burning of Washington. 

&quot;Old Brick&quot; served as a private school, a boarding house, and, during the American Civil War, a prison known as the Old Capitol Prison. It was demolished in 1929, and its site is now occupied by the U.S. Supreme Court building.

==Site history==
The site was located on Capitol Hill and was acquired from the Carroll family to accommodate the U.S. Capitol. Located at 1st and A streets NE in Washington, D.C., on the eastern slope of Capitol Hill, the site&#x27;s first building was a red brick tavern and hostel called Stelle&#x27;s Hotel, built around 1800. It was part of a neighborhood of rooming houses catering to the U.S. Congress.

===Temporary U.S. Capitol, 1815–1819===

In August 1814, during the War of 1812, the British burned the nearby United States Capitol building. The Congress, forced to meet in temporary quarters, pulled down the hostel at 1st and A streets, and built a temporary brick capitol building in the Federal style, laying the cornerstone on July 4, 1815. Congress then occupied the brick capitol from December 8, 1815, until 1819, while the original U.S. Capitol Building was rebuilt. The first inauguration of President James Monroe took place at the brick capitol on March 4, 1817.

The building was actually financed by Washington real-estate investors, who had heard rumors that some members of Congress were considering relocation of the national capital in the aftermath of the burning. The investors wanted to prevent their land values from decreasing by keeping the government in Washington.

===Old Brick Capitol, 1819–1861===
The building acquired the title &quot;Old Brick Capitol&quot; in 1819 when Congress and the Supreme Court returned to the restored U.S. Capitol Building. Until the time of the Civil War, the building was used as a private school, then as a boarding house. South Carolina Senator and former Vice President of the United States John C. Calhoun, who had been a leading member of the Fourteenth Congress when it met in the Old Brick Capitol, died in the boarding house in 1850.

===Old Capitol Prison, 1861–1867===
With the start of the Civil War in 1861, the Union repurchased the building to use as a prison for captured Confederates, as well as political prisoners, spies, Union officers convicted of insubordination, and local prostitutes. Famous inmates of the prison included Rose Greenhow, Belle Boyd, John Mosby, and Henry Wirz, who was hanged in the yard of the prison.

Many people arrested following the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln were also held here. These included Dr. Samuel Mudd, Mary Surratt, Louis Weichmann, and John T. Ford, owner of Ford&#x27;s Theater, where Lincoln was shot. The adjoining row of houses, Duff Green&#x27;s Row, was also used as part of the prison.

===Post-War use and demolition===
The government sold the Old Capitol Prison in 1867 to George T. Brown, then sergeant-at-arms of the U.S. Senate, who modified the building into three rowhouses collectively known as &quot;Trumbull&#x27;s Row.&quot; In the 20th century, they were used as the headquarters of the National Woman&#x27;s Party. In 1929, the site was acquired by eminent domain and the brick building was razed to clear the site for the U.S. Supreme Court Building.

<doc id="387987" wikidata="Q209601" url="?curid=387987" title="Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867">
<text>The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (, ) established the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary, which was a military and diplomatic alliance of two sovereign states. The Compromise only partially re-established the former pre-1848 sovereignty and status of the Kingdom of Hungary, being separate from, and no longer subject to, the Austrian Empire. The compromise put an end to the 18-year-long military dictatorship and absolutist rule over Hungary which Emperor Franz Joseph had instituted after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Hungary was restored. The agreement also restored the old historic constitution of the Kingdom of Hungary.

Hungarian political leaders had two main goals during the negotiations. One was to regain the traditional status (both legal and political) of the Hungarian state, which had been lost after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The other was to restore the series of reform laws (the so-called April Laws) of the revolutionary parliament of 1848, which were based on the 12 points that established modern civil and political rights and economic and societal reforms in Hungary. The April Laws of the Hungarian revolutionary parliament (with the exception of the laws based on the 9th and 10th points) were restored by Franz Joseph.

Under the Compromise, the lands of the House of Habsburg were reorganized as a real union between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary, headed by a single monarch who reigned as Emperor of Austria in the Austrian half of the empire, and as King of Hungary in the Kingdom of Hungary. The Cisleithanian (Austrian) and Transleithanian (Hungarian) states were governed by separate parliaments and prime ministers. The two countries conducted unified diplomatic and defence policies. For these purposes, &quot;common&quot; ministries of foreign affairs and defence were maintained under the monarch&#x27;s direct authority, as was a third finance ministry responsible only for financing the two &quot;common&quot; portfolios.

The relationship of Hungary to Austria before the 1848 revolution had been personal union, whereas after the compromise of 1867 its status was reduced to partnership in a real union. Thus Hungarian society widely considered the compromise as a betrayal of the vital Hungarian interests and the achievements of the reforms of 1848. The compromise remained bitterly unpopular among ethnic Hungarian voters: ethnic Hungarians did not generally support the ruling Liberal party in Hungarian parliamentary elections. Therefore, the political maintenance of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, and thus Austria-Hungary itself, was mostly a result of the popularity of the pro-compromise ruling Liberal Party among ethnic minority voters in the Kingdom of Hungary.

According to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, &quot;There were three of us who made the agreement: Deák, Andrássy and myself.&quot;

==Historical background==
===1526–1848===

In the Middle Ages, the Duchy of Austria was an autonomous state within the Holy Roman Empire, ruled by the House of Habsburg, and the Kingdom of Hungary was a sovereign state outside the empire. In 1526, Hungary was defeated and partially conquered by the Ottoman Empire. King Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia had no legitimate heir and died young in the Battle of Mohács. Louis II&#x27;s brother-in-law, Ferdinand I of Habsburg, was elected King of Hungary by a rump Parliament in Pozsony (now Bratislava) in December 1526. The Ottomans were subsequently driven out of Hungary by the cooperation of international Western Christian forces led by Prince Eugene of Savoy between 1686 and 1699. From 1526 to 1804, Hungary was ruled by the Habsburg dynasty as kings of Hungary, but remained nominally and legally separate from the other lands of the Habsburg monarchy.
Unlike other Habsburg-ruled areas, the Kingdom of Hungary had an old historic constitution, which limited the power of the Crown and had greatly increased the authority of the parliament since the 13th century. The Golden Bull of 1222 was one of the earliest examples of constitutional limits being placed on the powers of a European monarch, which was forced on the Hungarian king in much the same way King John of England was made to sign Magna Carta.

The Hungarian parliament was the most important political assembly since the 12th century, which emerged to the position of the supreme legislative institution in the Kingdom of Hungary from the 1290s.

In 1804, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was also ruler of the lands of the Habsburg monarchy, founded the Empire of Austria in which most his so-called &quot;Erblande&quot; lands were included. However the new Erblande term was not applied to Kingdom of Hungary In doing so he created a formal overarching structure for the Habsburg Monarchy, which had functioned as a composite monarchy for about 300 years. (Composite states/monarchies were the most common / dominant form of states in early modern era Europe.) The Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806. The Kingdom of Hungary had always been considered a separate realm, the country&#x27;s status was affirmed by Article X, which was added to Hungary&#x27;s constitution in 1790 during the phase of the composite monarchy; it described the state as a &quot;Regnum Independens&quot;. From the perspective of the Court since 1723, &quot;regnum Hungariae&quot; had been a hereditary province of the dynasty&#x27;s three main branches on both lines. From the perspective of the &quot;ország&quot; (the country), Hungary was &quot;regnum independens&quot;, a separate Land as the above mentioned Article X of 1790 stipulated. The Court reassured the diet, however, that the assumption of the monarch&#x27;s newly adopted title (Emperor of Austria) did not in any sense affect the laws and the constitution on the territory of Kingdom of Hungary. Hungary&#x27;s affairs continued to be administered by its own institutions (King and Diet and the local governments of its counties) as they had been previously. Thus, under the new arrangements, no Austrian imperial institutions were involved in its internal government. The Hungarian legal system and judicial system remained separated and independent from the unified legal and judicial systems of the other Habsburg ruled areas.

Accordingly, the administration and the structures of central government of Kingdom of Hungary also remained separate from the Austrian administration and Austrian government until the 1848 revolution. Hungary was governed to a greater degree by the Council of Lieutenancy of Hungary (the Gubernium) in Pressburg (Pozsony) and, to a lesser extent, by the Hungarian Royal Court Chancellery in Vienna, independent of the Imperial Chancellery of Austria.

From 1526 to 1851, the Kingdom of Hungary maintained its own customs borders, which separated Hungary from the united customs system of other Habsburg-ruled territories.

The involvement and integration of Kingdom of Hungary into a different state was legally impossible, due to the provisions of the old Hungarian constitution and Hungarian public law.

&quot;At any time in the past, Hungary might have made peace with a power with which Austria was at war, if the kings had not falsified their oath by not assembling the Hungarian Parliament: for the Diet always had the lawful right of [declaring] War and Peace.&quot;

The other serious problem for the Habsburgs was the traditionally highly autonomous counties of Hungary, which proved to be a solid and major obstacle in the construction of absolutism in Hungary. The counties were the centers of local public administration and local politics in Hungary, and they possessed a recognized right to refuse to carry out any &quot;unlawful&quot; (unconstitutional) royal orders. Thus, it was possible to question the legality of a surprisingly high proportion of the royal orders which emanated from Vienna.

While in most Western European countries (like France and the United Kingdom) the king&#x27;s reign began immediately upon the death of his predecessor, in Hungary the coronation was absolutely indispensable as if it were not properly executed, the Kingdom stayed &quot;orphaned&quot;. Even during the long personal union between the Kingdom of Hungary and other Habsburg-ruled areas, no Habsburg monarch could promulgate laws or exercise his royal prerogatives in the territory of Hungary until he had been crowned as King of Hungary. Since the Golden Bull of 1222, all Hungarian monarchs had to take a coronation oath during the coronation procedure, where the new monarchs had to agree to uphold the constitutional arrangement of the country, to preserve the liberties of his subjects and the territorial integrity of the realm.

===Revolution and military dictatorship===

====April laws and fundamental reforms in Hungary====

The April Laws, also known as &#x27;March Laws, were a set of statutes enacted by Lajos Kossuth aimed at transforming the Kingdom of Hungary into a modern parliamentary democracy and nation-state. These laws were approved by the Hungarian Diet in March 1848 in Pozsony (Pressburg, now Bratislava, Slovakia) and were signed by king Ferdinand V at the Primate&#x27;s Palace in the same city on 11 April 1848.
&lt;br&gt;

The April Laws completely abolished all privileges of the Hungarian nobility. In April 1848, Hungary became the third country in Continental Europe—following France (1791) and Belgium (1831)—to establish legislation for democratic parliamentary elections. The new suffrage law (Act V of 1848) replaced the feudal estates-based parliament (Estates General) with a democratic representative parliament, offering the broadest suffrage rights in Europe at that time. The imperative program included Hungarian control over its popular national guard, the national budget, and foreign policy, as well as the abolition of serfdom.

In 1848, the young Austrian monarch, Francis Joseph, arbitrarily &quot;revoked&quot; these laws without any legal authority. This act was unconstitutional, as the laws remained in force due to having been signed by his uncle, King Ferdinand I, and he had no right to &quot;revoke&quot; them.

=====The unconstitutional nature of Franz Joseph&#x27;s rule=====

From a legal perspective, the coronation oath stipulated that a crowned king of Hungary could not abdicate the throne during his lifetime. Should a reigning king be alive yet unable to fulfill his royal duties, a governor (or regent, as the term is known in English) was required to assume those royal responsibilities. Constitutionally, Franz Joseph&#x27;s uncle, Ferdinand, remained the legitimate king of Hungary. There was no mechanism for automatic inheritance of the throne due to the fact, that King Ferdinand was alive. However, if the monarch sought to abdicate and appoint a successor before his death, the only lawful course of action was for the parliament to dethrone the old king and elect a new one. Amidst the prevailing legal and military tensions, the Hungarian parliament declined to grant Franz Joseph this privilege. This circumstance provided a semblance of legal justification for the ensuing revolt. Thus, from that point until the revolution&#x27;s conclusion, Lajos Kossuth, as the elected regent-president, emerged as both the de facto and de jure ruler of Hungary. Until the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867, the Hungarian Parliament did not approve the coronation of Franz Joseph as King of Hungary.

====The newly created Habsburg constitution====
On 7 March 1849, an imperial proclamation was issued in the name of Emperor Franz Joseph, establishing a unified constitution for the entire empire. Under this new decree, the traditional territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Hungary would be dismantled and divided into five distinct military districts, while the Principality of Transylvania would be reestablished. Austrian Prime Minister Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg and his government, which took office in November 1848, embarked on a radically new imperial policy. Their aim was to cultivate a cohesive empire in accordance with the imperial constitution proclaimed by Franz Joseph I in Olomouc on 4 March 1849. Consequently, this initiative entailed the abolition of Hungary&#x27;s constitution and its territorial integrity. The centralizing March Constitution of Austria introduced neo-absolutism within Habsburg-ruled territories, granting the monarch absolute power. The Austrian constitution was ratified by the Imperial Diet of Austria, in which Hungary had no representation and had historically lacked legislative authority over the Kingdom of Hungary. Nevertheless, the constitution also sought to dismantle the Diet of Hungary, which had served as the supreme legislative body in Hungary since the late 12th century. The new Austrian constitution also contravened Hungary&#x27;s historical constitution and sought to invalidate it.

====Military dictatorship====

During the unsuccessful Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Magyars came close to severing ties with the Habsburg Dynasty, but their efforts were thwarted by the Austrian Empire with military intervention from the Russian Empire. 
In the hope of Russian military support, the young Emperor Franz Joseph kissed the hands of the Ruler of all the Russians in Warsaw on 21 May 1849. Nicholas I of Russia agreed with Franz Joseph and sent a 200,000 strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. The joint Russo-Austrian army finally defeated the Hungarian forces.

Following the restoration of Habsburg authority, Hungary was placed under martial law. A military dictatorship was created in Hungary.

Every facet of Hungarian life was subjected to rigorous scrutiny and Austrian governmental control.

German was declared the official language of public administration. An edict issued on 9 October 1849 placed education under state oversight, with the curriculum dictated by the government. The teaching of national history was restricted, and history was presented from a Habsburg perspective. Even the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, a stronghold of Hungarian culture, was kept under strict control, being staffed predominantly by foreigners, mostly Germans, and effectively became defunct until the end of 1858. In response, Hungarians engaged in passive resistance, and anti-Habsburg and anti-German sentiments ran high. In the following years, the empire introduced several reforms but failed to address the underlying issues.
After the Hungarian Revolution of 1848–49, Hungary&#x27;s independent customs system was abolished, and on 1 October 1851, it became part of the unified imperial customs system.
==Austrian military and economic crisis and adoption==
The suppression of the 1848 Revolutions and the Russian intervention had a very high price.
In 1858 already 40 percent of the Austrian Imperial government&#x27;s expenditures went to service the state debt. An expensive mobilization during the Crimean War (1853–1856) and a disastrous campaign against Piedmont-Sardinia in 1859 brought the state to the verge of bankruptcy. The threat of fiscal insolvency and the demands of his creditors for an open and credible budgetary process forced the unwilling Franz Joseph to authorize political reform.

In 1866, Austria was completely defeated in the Austro-Prussian War. Its position as the leading state of Germany ended, and the remaining German minor states were soon absorbed into the German Empire, created by Prussia&#x27;s Bismarck. Austria also lost much of its remaining claims and influence in Italy, which had been its chief foreign policy interest.

After a period of Greater German ambitions, when Austria tried to establish itself as the leading German power, Austria again needed to redefine itself to maintain unity in the face of nationalism.

As a consequence of the Second Italian War of Independence and the Austro-Prussian War, the Habsburg Empire was on the verge of collapse in 1866, as these wars caused monumental state debt and a financial crisis. The Habsburgs were forced to reconcile with Hungary, to save their empire and dynasty. The Habsburgs and part of the Hungarian political elite arranged the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. The Compromise was arranged and legitimated by a very small part of the Hungarian society (suffrage was very limited: less than 8% of the population had voting rights), and was seen by a very large part of the population as betrayal of the Hungarian cause and the heritage of the 1848–49 War of Independence. This caused deep and lasting cracks in Hungarian society.

Hungarian statesman Ferenc Deák is considered the intellectual force behind the Compromise. Deák initially wanted independence for Hungary and supported the 1848 Revolution, but he broke with hardline nationalists and advocated a modified union under the Habsburgs. Deák believed that while Hungary had the right to full internal independence, the terms of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1723 made questions of defence and foreign affairs &quot;common&quot; to both Austria and Hungary. The Pragmatic Sanction of 1723 had great impact on the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. As the Hungarian statesman Ferenc Deák argued, according to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1723, constitutional governing of Hungary was a fundamental prerequisite of the Habsburg rule over Hungary. The foreign policy and defense, as well as financing them, were the most important joint affairs of Austria-Hungary, the resulting dual monarchy, to be based on the Pragmatic Sanction of 1723. He also felt that Hungary benefited from continued union with wealthier, more industrialized Austria and that the Compromise would end the continual pressures on Austria to choose between the Magyars and the Slavs of the Kingdom of Hungary. Imperial Chancellor Beust quickly negotiated the Compromise with the Hungarian leaders. Beust was particularly eager to renew the conflict with Prussia and thought a quick settlement with Hungary would make that possible. Franz Joseph and Deák signed the Compromise, and it was ratified by the restored Diet of Hungary on 29 May 1867.

Beust&#x27;s revenge against Prussia did not materialize. When, in 1870, Beust wanted Austria–Hungary to support France against Prussia, Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Andrássy was &quot;vigorously opposed&quot; and effectively vetoed Austrian intervention.

The settlement with Hungary consisted then of three parts: the political settlement, which was to be permanent and would remain part of the fundamental constitution of the monarchy; the periodical financial settlement, determining the partition of the common expenses as arranged by the Quota-Deputations and ratified by the parliaments; and the Customs Union and the agreement on currency, a voluntary, reversible arrangement between the two governments and parliaments.

== Terms ==

Under the Compromise:
* The old historic constitution of Hungary was restored.
* The Hungarian parliament was re-established (which had been the supreme legislative power in Hungary since the 12th century), as it was before 1849. Each part of the Monarchy had its own government, headed by its own prime minister. The &quot;dual monarchy&quot; consisted of the Emperor-King, and the common ministers of foreign affairs, defence, and a finance ministry only for expenditures of the Common Army, navy and diplomatic service.
* The Hungarian legal system and Hungarian laws were restored in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary. During the negotiations of the compromise, even the April Laws of the Hungarian revolutionary parliament (with the exception of the laws based on the 9th and 10th points) were also accepted by the monarch.
* The traditionally independent and separate judicial system of Hungary was restored.
* Austria–Hungary, as a common entity, had no jurisdiction and legislative power, which was shaped by the fact that there was no common parliament. The common diplomatic and military affairs were managed by delegations from the Imperial Council and the Hungarian parliament. The delegations had 60 members from the Imperial Council, and 60 members from the Hungarian parliament, and the ratios of various political fractions exactly and proportionally mirrored their own political parties of their parliaments. The members of the delegations from the two parliaments had no right to give speeches, to debate, or introduce new ideas during the meetings; thus they were nothing more than the extended arms of their own parliaments. The only function of the delegates was to cast their votes according to the previously made decisions of their political factions in the Austrian and the Hungarian parliaments. All common decisions had to be ratified by the Austrian parliament to be valid on Austrian territory, and by the Hungarian parliament to be valid on the territory of Kingdom of Hungary. The Austrian and Hungarian delegations hold their joint meeting in Vienna in every odd year, and in Pest in every even year.
* With the exception of the territory of Bosnian Condominium, Austria and Hungary did not form a common sovereign territory in international law (i.e. Kingdom of Hungary and Empire of Austria were different countries). Thus regarding to territorial changes during peace treaties, the Empire of Austria and Kingdom of Hungary had to act independently as independent countries: a delegate from the Austrian parliament had right to sign peace treaties related to territorial changes of the Austrian Empire, and respectively, a delegate from the Hungarian parliament had right to sign peace treaties regarding to territorial changes of the Kingdom of Hungary. 
* A common Ministry of Foreign Affairs was created, responsible for diplomacy and foreign policy. Further information: Foreign Ministry of Austria-Hungary
* There was no common citizenship in Austria–Hungary: one was either an Austrian citizen or a Hungarian citizen, never both. Austria–Hungary used two separate passports: the Austrian passport and the Hungarian one. There was no common passport.
* A common finance ministry was founded, only for the expenditures of the Common Army, the navy and the diplomatic service and for the issue of banknotes. It was headed by the Common Finance Minister. All other expenditures belonged to the Austrian Finance Ministry in the Austrian Empire and the Hungarian Finance Ministry in the Kingdom of Hungary. The Austrian finance minister was subordinated only to the Minister-President of Austria in the Austrian Empire, and the Hungarian Finance Minister was subordinated only to the Prime Minister of Hungary. 
* The monetary and economic terms of the Compromise and the customs union had to be renegotiated every ten years.
* Despite Austria and Hungary sharing a common currency, they were fiscally sovereign and independent entities.
* The international commercial treaties and trade agreements were conducted independently by Austria and Hungary, as independent nations. The Common Finance Ministry had no competence in the international commercial treaties and trade agreements of the Austrian state or the Hungarian state.
* The Royal Hungarian Honvéd was restored, and the Imperial-Royal Landwehr was created, but both states had to continue to finance the Austro-Hungarian Common Army, much larger than both. A common Austro-Hungarian War Ministry was formed immediately for the large Common Army, but it had no right to command directly the smaller Austrian Landwehr and the Hungarian Honvéd armies, which were respectively placed under the direct control of the separate Austrian and Hungarian Ministries of Defence. The Austrian and Hungarian Ministers of Defence were not placed under the command and jurisdiction of the Common War Ministry; they were subordinated only to their own prime ministers and the respective parliaments in Vienna and Budapest. The Hungarian Honvéd army could join the imperial army only with the explicit authorization of the Hungarian government. Further information: Imperial and Royal Ministry of War
* Hungary took on a large part of the towering Austrian state debt.
* The Emperor-King held all authority over the structure, organization, and administration of the three armies. He appointed the senior officials, had the right to declare war, and was the commander-in-chief of the army.
* The Emperor-King had the right to declare a state of emergency.
* The Emperor-King had the right of preliminary royal assent to every bill the Cabinet Council wanted to report to the National Assembly. He had the right to veto any law passed by the National Assemblies.
* The Emperor-King had the right to dissolve the National Assemblies and of the declaration of new parliamentary elections.
* The Emperor-King had the right to appoint and dismiss the members of the Cabinet Councils.

The power of the monarch significantly increased in a comparison with the pre-1848 status of Hungary. This meant a great reduction in Hungarian sovereignty and autonomy, even in comparison with the pre-1848 status quo.

== Continuing pressures ==

===The dominance of ethnic minority elected Liberal Party in the Hungarian Parliament===

The Austro-Hungarian compromise and its supporting liberal parliamentary parties remained bitterly unpopular among the ethnic Hungarian voters, and the continuous successes of these pro-compromise Liberal Party in the Hungarian parliamentary elections caused long lasting frustration for Hungarians. The ethnic minorities had the key role in the political maintenance of the compromise in Hungary, because they were able to vote the pro-compromise liberal parties into the position of the majority/ruling parties of the Hungarian parliament. The pro-compromise Liberal Party of Hungary was the most popular among ethnic minority voters, however i.e. the Slovak, Serb and Romanian minority parties remained unpopular among their own ethnic minority voters. The coalitions of Hungarian nationalist parties – which were supported by the overwhelming majority of ethnic Hungarian voters – always remained in the opposition, with the exception of the 1906–1910 period, where the Hungarian-supported nationalist parties were able to form a government.

===Ethnic minorities===
Before the World War I, only three European countries declared ethnic minority rights, and enacted minority-protecting laws: the first was Hungary (1849 and 1868), the second was Austria (1867), and the third was Belgium (1898). In contrast, the legal systems of other pre-WW1 era European countries did not allow the use of European minority languages in primary schools, in cultural institutions, in offices of public administration and at the legal courts.

The resulting system was maintained until the dissolution of the dual monarchy after World War I. The favoritism shown to the Magyars, the second largest ethnic group in the dual monarchy after the Germans, caused discontent on the part of other ethnic groups like the Slovaks and Romanians. Although a &quot;Nationalities Law&quot; was enacted to preserve the rights of ethnic minorities, the two parliaments took very different approaches to this issue.

The basic problem in the later years was that the Compromise with Hungary only encouraged the appetites of non-Hungarian minorities in Hungary that were historically within the boundaries of the Hungarian Kingdom. The majority of Hungarians felt they had accepted the Compromise only under coercion. The Hungarian monarchs were always crowned as King of Hungary, due to the Hungarian coronation oath they had to agree to uphold the old constitutional arrangements of the country and preserve the territorial integrity of the Hungarian realm. This coronation oath was obligatory for the Hungarian monarchs during the coronation process since the Golden Bull of 1222. The Hungarians, who were regarded as equal after the Compromise, only partially acquiesced to granting &quot;their&quot; minorities recognition and local autonomy.

In the Kingdom of Hungary, several ethnic minorities faced increased pressures of Magyarization. Further, the renegotiation that occurred every ten years often led to constitutional crises. Ultimately, although the Compromise hoped to fix the problems faced by a multi-national state while maintaining the benefits of a large state, the new system still faced the same internal pressures as the old. To what extent the dual monarchy stabilized the country in the face of national awakenings and to what extent it alleviated or aggravated the situation is still debated today.

In a letter on 1 February 1913, to Foreign Minister Berchtold, Archduke Franz Ferdinand said that &quot;irredentism in our country ... will cease immediately if our Slavs are given a comfortable, fair and good life&quot; instead of being trampled on (as they were being trampled on by the Hungarians).

==Influence in Ireland==

As early as the mid-1880s, Lord Salisbury, leader of the British Conservative Party, had contemplated using the 1867 Austro-Hungarian example as a model for a reformed relationship between Britain and Ireland. In 1904, Arthur Griffith published the highly influential book &quot;The Resurrection of Hungary: A Parallel for Ireland&quot;, setting out a detailed proposal for an Anglo-Irish dual monarchy similar to the Austro-Hungarian one. This dual monarchy model was advocated by Griffith&#x27;s party in its early years of existence and had a considerable influence on the development of Irish Nationalism – though after the Easter Rising and subsequent October 1917 , it was dropped in favour of Irish Republicanism.

The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which established the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary, is occasionally cited in speculative and folkloric accounts as having an influence on Ireland during its struggle for autonomy within the British Empire. While there is no historical evidence to support these claims, some narratives suggest that Irish nationalist leaders viewed the Compromise as a model for negotiating Home Rule.

According to these accounts, the structure of the Dual Monarchy, which granted Hungary significant autonomy while preserving its union with Austria, was admired by Irish political thinkers. This theoretical influence is said to have shaped discussions within the Home Rule movement, fostering ideas of an &quot;Irish-British dual governance&quot; arrangement.

As a young student, he studied (never finishing an undergraduate degree) composition, performance, and electronic music at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with Salvatore Martirano, Lejaren Hiller, Kenneth Gaburo, Gordon Binkerd, Bernard Goodman, Paul Rolland, Jack McKenzie, Soulima Stravinsky, John Garvey, and others. Working with Don Buchla, he was one of the first composers to use a digital synthesizer. He has performed at CalArts with Trichy Sankaran.

Rosenboom was married to performance artist and vocalist Jacqueline Humbert until 2012. He has three children from the union — Daniel, Dorothea, and Lindsay.

<doc id="387995" wikidata="Q1727463" url="?curid=387995" title="Tryon County, North Carolina">
<text>Tryon County is a former county which was located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It was formed in 1768 from the part of Mecklenburg County west of the Catawba River, although the legislative act that created it did not become effective until April 10, 1769. Due to inaccurate and delayed surveying, Tryon County encompassed a large area of northwestern South Carolina. It was named for William Tryon, governor of the North Carolina Colony from 1765 to 1771.

The county seat, finally designated in 1774, was located eight miles southwest of the present-day community of Lincolnton, in Lincoln County.

==History==
The act establishing the county named commissioners to select a place &quot;whereon to erect court house, prison and stocks.&quot; The initial court records beginning with the April 1769 sessions were recorded by Ezekiel Polk, clerk, and the grandfather of James K. Polk, 11th president of the United States.

In 1771 Governor Tryon called out five militiamen of Tryon County to help put down the Regulator Movement, a protest against corrupt county officials and excessive taxes, centered in counties to the northeast of Tryon. Although the colony was officially at peace with the Indians from 1763 to 1776, the Tryon County frontier was the target of occasional raids, usually by Cherokee, but sometimes by Shawnee and other faraway tribes. Settlers constructed several stockade forts to protect themselves and their neighbors: Fort McGaughey was near Brittain Church; Fort McFadden was on Mountain Creek near Rutherfordton; and Potts&#x27; Fort in Montfords Cove.

It was not until 1774 that any county buildings were planned or even constructed, using appointed residents&#x27; houses for county activities in the interim. The commissioners (appointed by an Act of Assembly to select the place whereon to erect and build the court-house, prison and stocks of Tryon County, on 26 July 1774) reported their selection of the place: &quot;..called &quot; &#x27;the crossroads&#x27; &quot;, on Christian Mauney&#x27;s land, between the heads of Long Creek, Muddy Creek, and Beaver Dam Creek in the county aforesaid as most central and convenient for the purpose aforesaid.&quot; The county court then adjourned to immediately re-meet at Mauney&#x27;s. The site of the old Tryon courthouse is eight miles southwest of Lincolnton, Lincoln County, North Carolina colony. The October Sessions of 1774, were also held at the house of Mauney, and a room in his dwelling was designated as county jail.

When the British-allied Cherokee attacked several settlements in the county early in the American War for Independence (1776), most Tories joined with their Whig neighbors in fighting off the raiders. General Griffith Rutherford then led a punitive expedition to devastate the Overhill Cherokee towns across the Blue Ridge Mountains, .
Following the Battle of Lexington in Massachusetts, 49 county residents gathered at the courthouse and issued the Tryon Resolves, a declaration of resistance to coercive actions by the British Empire against its North American colonies. Although not a statement of independence, the Tryon Resolves were among the earliest of many local colonial declarations which called for the redress of perceived wrongs inflicted on the colonies from the British Parliament and The Crown. The document was signed on August 14, 1775, predating the United States Declaration of Independence by almost 11 months.

Earlier in the decade, Tryon residents had formed a Committee of Safety to provide security for the settlers in the area. Now, the committee had to prepare for a potential war. As tensions between the North American colonies and the British government further increased, the committeemen, all signers of &quot;The Resolves,&quot; gathered the following month (on September 14, 1775). At that time they formed the Tryon County, North Carolina militia in preparation for British retaliation against American resistance.

In 1779, Tryon County was divided into Lincoln and Rutherford Counties in North Carolina, and ceased to exist.

==Geography==
In December 1768, Governor Tryon described the area in a letter as: 
&quot;&quot;...forty-five miles in breadth due north and south and eighty miles due east and west—it having been found to be that distance from the Catawba River to the western frontier line which was run last year between the Cherokee hunting grounds and this Province&quot;.&quot;

The original area of Tryon County encompassed the following modern day areas:
The entire areas of:

* Cleveland County, North Carolina, including Kings Mountain
* Gaston County, North Carolina
* Lincoln County, including Ramsour&#x27;s Mill
* Rutherford County, North Carolina
* Cherokee County, South Carolina
* Chester County, South Carolina
* Laurens County, South Carolina
* Spartanburg County, South Carolina
* Union County, South Carolina
* York County, South Carolina

...and parts of:

* Burke County, North Carolina
* McDowell County, North Carolina
* Greenville County, South Carolina
* Newberry County, South Carolina
* The Catawba Indian Reservation
==Notable people==
*William Graham, militia and political leader during the War for Independence.
*Frederick Hambright, &quot;Resolves&quot; signer and militia leader wounded during the War for Independence.
*Joseph Hardin, &quot;Resolves&quot; signer, militia leader during the War for Independence, and later a legislative representative for the State of Franklin and the Southwest Territory.

<doc id="387996" wikidata="Q1969196" url="?curid=387996" title="Pick-up sticks">
<text>Pick-up sticks, pick-a-stick, jackstraws, jack straws, spillikins, spellicans, or fiddlesticks is a game of physical and mental skill in which a bundle of sticks, between 8 and 20 centimeters long, is dropped as a loose bunch onto a table top into a random pile. Each player, in turn, tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others. The object of the game is to pick up the most sticks or to score the most points based on the color of the sticks.

==History==
The origin of the game of pick-up sticks is disputed, but it is believed to have developed from the yarrow stalks used for divination with the Chinese &quot;I Ching&quot;. The game became popular in the 1800s in Germany, the United Kingdom (where it was played at least as early as 1945 at Windsor Castle), and the United States. A particularly popular version of the game during the 1930s-50s, 456 Pickup Sticks, was manufactured by O. Schoenhut Inc, an offshoot of the US-based Schoenhut Piano Company.

In the 1800s, pick-up sticks were generally made from ivory or bone; modern sticks may be made of almost any material, such as wood, bamboo, straw, reed, rush, yarrow, or plastics. 

A game similar to pick-up sticks is also played by the Haida First Nation, with sticks made of plain maple wood decorated with abalone shell and copper.

== Play ==

In a game of pick-up sticks, there are typically 30 or more sticks and at least two players. At the beginning of game play, the bundle of sticks is randomly distributed or dropped so the sticks end up in a tangled pile. The more tangled the pile, the more challenging the game. In some versions of the game any sticks not touching at least one other stick are removed. The first player (sometimes the youngest) attempts to remove a single stick at a time, without moving any other stick. If the player succeeds, that player&#x27;s turn continues. If a player moves another stick, the turn immediately passes clockwise to the next player.

The object of the game is for a player to pick up more sticks than picked up by any other players. In more complex games, different-colored sticks are worth different numbers of points, and the winner is the person with the highest score.

In some versions of the game, the next player can opt to begin a turn by asking the player after that to pick up all the sticks and randomly remake the pile.

In some versions of the game, players may use only their fingers to move the desired stick. In other versions, players may use a tool to move one stick away from the pile; this tool may be one of the sticks, held aside before the game begins, or a particular colored stick, typically black, that may be won by a player who successfully moves it.

== Variants ==
=== Mikado ===

Mikado is a pick-up-sticks game originating in Europe, played with a set of longer sticks which can measure between , all having the same length. The game is named for the highest-scoring (blue) stick, the &quot;Mikado&quot; (Emperor of Japan).

====Mikado Scoring====
=== Farm Tools ===
The pieces in a Farm tools set are related to farmyard tools, such as ladders, rakes, shovels, and hoes. Typically, around 45 pieces are in a set, made of wood, plastic, bone, or ivory. In addition to the tools, typically a helper piece with a hooked end is included for use in snagging and manipulating pieces. Each piece has a point value, with more challenging pieces being worth more points.

<text>Vitaly Mikhaylovich Zholobov (; ; born 18 June 1937) is a retired Soviet cosmonaut who flew on Soyuz 21 space flight as the flight engineer, and a former head of Kherson Regional Council in Ukraine.

==Career==
Zholobov joined the space programme from the Soviet Air Force where he held the rank of Colonel-engineer.

His only trip to space involved a two-month stay on the Salyut 5 space station (Soyuz 21 mission). The flight was scheduled to last for 60 days but lasted for only 49. The reason for the cancellation was the detection of a noxious odor on board. Zholobov reported to the Mission Control Center that the smell was similar to that of a propellant which was known to be toxic. The Control Center decided to abort the mission to avoid exposing the crew to further risk and because the research and technology programs were already successfully finished. He was in orbit from 6 June 1976 to 24 August 1976.

Although he never flew again, Zholobov stayed in the space programme until 1981 when he resigned to become director of a geological science research group.

== Political career ==
In 1994, he was elected in the Kherson region as the Chairman of the Kherson Regional Council — the head of the Kherson Regional Administration. He held this position until 1996. At this time, his deputy was killed by a hired killer.

From 12 June 1996 to 4 February 1997, he held the position of Deputy General Director of the National Space Agency of Ukraine. 

Since 1999, he has been the chairman of the board of the Kyiv organization &quot;Slava&quot;, since 2001 he has been the president of the All-Ukrainian association &quot;Slava&quot;. 

From 11 April 2002 to 2015, he was the president of the Aerospace Society of Ukraine. 

==Awards==
*Hero of the Soviet Union

<text>Colin Carhart McPhee (March 15, 1900 – January 7, 1964) was a Canadian-American composer and ethnomusicologist. He is best known for being the first Western composer to make a musicological study of Bali, and to develop American gamelan along with fellow composer Lou Harrison. He wrote original music influenced by that of Bali and Java, decades before compositions based on world music became widespread.

==Early life and career==
===Childhood===
McPhee was born on March 15, 1900, in Montréal, Québec, Canada, to a family of mostly Scottish and German ancestry. His father, Alexander McPhee, was an advertising executive for Bell Telephone Company. His mother, Lavinia McPhee (&quot;née&quot; Carhart) was originally from New Jersey and settled in Montréal after marrying Alexander.

===First musical education===
In 1918 he enrolled in the Peabody Institute at the Johns Hopkins University, studying composition with Gustav Strube and piano with Harold Randolph; subsequently he studied with the avant-garde composer Edgard Varèse before marrying Jane Belo, a disciple of Margaret Mead, in 1931.

==Career==
McPhee joined the circle of experimental composers known as the &quot;ultra-modernists&quot; and was among those—along with the group&#x27;s leader, Henry Cowell, John J. Becker, and Cowell protégé Lou Harrison—particularly interested in what would later become known as &quot;world music&quot;. McPhee and his wife moved to Bali together for Belo&#x27;s anthropological work. Once there McPhee studied, filmed and wrote extensively about the culture and music of the gamelans, and in 1936 wrote an original musical score, &quot;Tabuh Tabuhan&quot;, in the Balinese style.

McPhee, who was gay, divorced Belo in 1939. In the early 1940s he lived in a large brownstone in Brooklyn, which he shared with W. H. Auden and Benjamin Britten, among others.

In 1942, he arranged Britten&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge&quot;, a work for string orchestra, for two pianos, to be used for Lew Christensen&#x27;s ballet &quot;Jinx&quot;. McPhee was responsible for introducing Britten to the Balinese music that influenced such works by the British composer as &quot;The Prince of the Pagodas&quot;, &quot;Curlew River&quot;, and &quot;Death in Venice&quot;.

In 1947, McPhee published a book &quot;A House in Bali&quot;, about Balinese culture and music during the 1930s. Later in the decade, McPhee fell into an alcohol-fueled depression, but began to write music again during the 1950s. He became professor of ethnomusicology at UCLA in 1958 and was also a respected jazz critic. He died in Los Angeles.

In the 1990s, Alex Pauk&#x27;s Esprit Orchestra recorded and released renditions of several never previously recorded compositions by McPhee. This resulted in McPhee receiving posthumous Juno Award nominations for Best Classical Composition for &quot;Symphony No. 2&quot; at the Juno Awards of 1998 and &quot;Concerto for Wind Orchestra&quot; at the Juno Awards of 1999. He won the award in 1999.

American composer Evan Ziporyn wrote an opera about McPhee&#x27;s life, titled &quot;A House in Bali&quot;. The opera premiered at Puri Saraswati in Ubud, Bali, on June 26 and 27, 2009.

In 2017, an album &quot;Peter Pears: Balinese Ceremonial Music&quot;, performed Thomas Bartlett &amp; Nico Muhly and partly based on McPhee&#x27;s transcriptions, was released on the Nonesuch/Warners label.

==Published works==
McPhee&#x27;s &quot;A House in Bali&quot;, the chronicle of his life there, is still considered a valuable introduction to Balinese culture. His posthumously published &quot;Music in Bali&quot; was the first comprehensive analysis of Balinese music published in English.

His best-known musical work is &quot;Tabuh-Tabuhan: Toccata for Orchestra,&quot; composed and premiered in Mexico in 1936. Its title translates as &quot;collection of percussion instruments&quot;, and it combines Balinese and traditional Western musical elements. It is scored for Western orchestra but, in McPhee&#x27;s description, the core of the ensemble is a &quot;&#x27;nuclear gamelan&#x27; composed of two pianos, celesta, xylophone, marimba, and glockenspiel,&quot; giving it a percussive balance of sound. The orchestra is augmented by two Balinese gongs and cymbals. The work is in three movements: &quot;Ostinatos,&quot; a flute-related &quot;Nocturne,&quot; and a syncopated &quot;Finale.&quot; Some of the themes in it derive from Balinese folk sources. In 2013, the piece was choreographed and performed by the American Ballet Theater Company.

<text>Crédit Foncier de France (, CFF) was a major French bank, active from 1852 to 2019 when its activities were entirely subsumed into Groupe BPCE, although the brand name appears to remain active. 

==History==
The Crédit Foncier (English: landed credit) initially made loans to communes. The movement was initiated by Louis Wolowski and Count Xavier Branicki, and sanctioned by Emperor Napoléon III in 1852 in an attempt to modernize the medieval French banking system and expand French investment outside Europe. Its name became the &quot;Banque Foncière of Paris&quot;. Similar institutions at Nevers and Marseilles were amalgamated into one under the title of &quot;Crédit Foncier de France&quot;. The amount of the loan could not exceed half of the value of the property pledged or hypothecated, and that the repayment of the loan was by an annuity, which included the interest and part of the principal, terminable at a certain date. The Crédit Foncier had a monopoly on mortgages.

In French banking terminology, a &quot;credit foncier loan&quot; typically refers to a loan for a fixed period with regular repayments where each repayment includes components of both principal and interest, such that at the end of the period the principal will have been entirely repaid. This is to be contrasted with an “interest only” loan where the repayments are of interest only.

On 26 June 2018 it was announced that the organisation was to be closed, and its activities integrated into BPCE. The brand appears to remain active.

==Former headquarters==

The Crédit Foncier used to be headquartered in a prestigious building complex that included the former on Place Vendôme, and the on rue des Capucines as well as a number of adjacent constructions. Crédit Foncier moved into the Hôtel Castanier as early as 1854, had it remodeled by architect Antoine-Nicolas Bailly, and expanded into the Hotel d&#x27;Evreux in 1896. 

The property was sold by Crédit Foncier to the Thani family of Qatar in 2003 for 250 million euro, and was comprehensively renovated from 2009.

<text>White&#x27;s Ford was an important ford over the Potomac River during the American Civil War. It was used in many major actions, including the crossing into Maryland of the Confederate army prior to the Maryland Campaign and Confederate Major General J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s ride around Union Major General George B. McClellan on October 10, 1862, when he used the ford to cross into Loudoun County, Virginia. It is located a few miles above present-day White&#x27;s Ferry.

The ford was named after Captain Elijah V. White, a Confederate cavalry officer and leader of the cavalry battalion known as the Comanches. His farm was on the Virginia side of the ford.

<text>The Amanda Show is an American sketch comedy and variety show television series created by Dan Schneider and starring Amanda Bynes that aired on Nickelodeon from October 16, 1999, to September 21, 2002. A spin-off of &quot;All That&quot;, another Nickelodeon variety show featuring Bynes, &quot;The Amanda Show&quot;&#x27;s cast members include Drake Bell, Nancy Sullivan, John Kassir, Raquel Lee, and Josh Peck. Writers for the show include Christy Stratton, Jenny Kilgen, Dan Schneider, John Hoberg, Steven Molaro, and Andrew Hill Newman. 

&quot;The Amanda Show&quot; was abruptly canceled after the third season, which left an unresolved plot line in the recurring sketch &quot;Moody&#x27;s Point&quot;. Bynes pursued roles in Schneider&#x27;s feature film &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; and the Schneider-created television series &quot;What I Like About You&quot; for The WB. Schneider would later cast series regulars Bell, Peck, and Sullivan in his follow-up Nickelodeon series, &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;.

Decades after the series&#x27; end, allegations by cast and crew members have detailed salary discrimination, sexism, inappropriate behavior, and sexual abuse at Nickelodeon during the show&#x27;s run that were not previously revealed publicly. &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; is one of several series highlighted in these accusations, which are summarized in the 2024 documentary &quot;Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV&quot;.

==Format==
&quot;The Amanda Show&quot; is a sketch comedy television program set in a universe in which it is broadcast as a popular television comedy (a show-within-a-show). Recurring sketches include &quot;Judge Trudy&quot;, a spoof of the courtroom reality &quot;Judge Judy&quot;; &quot;So You Want to Win Five Dollars?&quot;, a spoof of the ABC game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;; &quot;Moody&#x27;s Point&quot;, a spoof of the teen drama &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;; and &quot;Blockblister&quot;, a spoof of the now-defunct video rental store Blockbuster.

==Background and production==
At age 10, Amanda Bynes was performing stand-up comedy in Hollywood when Nickelodeon&#x27;s talent scouts took notice and offered her a role on the network&#x27;s live-action variety series &quot;All That&quot;. Finding success on the series, Bynes appeared in an array of guest roles in film and television as well as a recurring panelist role on Nickelodeon game show &quot;Figure It Out&quot;. Nickelodeon president Albie Hecht noted Bynes&#x27; &quot;amazing star quality&quot; and called her &quot;a little Carol Burnett.&quot;

On October 16, 1999, &quot;The Amanda Show&quot;, an &quot;All That&quot; spin-off created by series producer Dan Schneider, premiered in the Saturday evening prime time slot on Nickelodeon, which released AmandaPlease.com, a tie-in website, around the same time. The series was filmed in front of a live studio audience at Nickelodeon on Sunset in Hollywood, California. Beginning with the second season, John Kassir and Raquel Lee left the series, and Josh Peck was added as a series regular.

After three seasons, the series run concluded on September 21, 2002. Regarding her departure from Nickelodeon in 2002, Bynes stated, &quot;I knew I didn&#x27;t want to be a Nickelodeon kid when I was 30. I was having fun but at 15, you don&#x27;t want to be doing what you did when you were 12.&quot; Bynes would go on to star in Schneider&#x27;s &quot;What I Like About You&quot; for The WB, and Bell and Peck would co-star in Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;, also created by Schneider.

===Controversy and &quot;Quiet on Set&quot; documentary===

In 2024, Drake Bell revealed publicly that he had been sexually abused by dialogue coach Brian Peck in 2001, during the production of &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; when Bell was 15 years old. Peck had been arrested in 2003 and sentenced to 16 months in prison and being required to register as a sex offender in 2004, but the identity of the minor victim had not previously been made public. Bell&#x27;s testimony coincided with the lead-up to &quot;Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV&quot;, an Investigation Discovery documentary detailing allegations of abuse from people who worked on Nickelodeon&#x27;s television productions from the 1990s to the 2000s, specifically series involving Dan Schneider.

Christy Stratton and Jenny Kilgen, two writers who primarily worked during the series&#x27; first season, presented further allegations that Schneider&#x27;s writers&#x27; room was rife with inappropriate language and behavior to the point that &quot;Dan was showing pornography on his computer screen,&quot; according to Kilgen. The two were allegedly required to split a single salary during their time at Nickelodeon. A gender discrimination and hostile workplace lawsuit filed in 2000 alleged that Schneider inappropriately requested massages from the crew, but it was settled out of court. These allegations were reported publicly as early as 2022, following the release of &quot;iCarly&quot; star Jennette McCurdy&#x27;s book &quot;I&#x27;m Glad My Mom Died&quot;.

In an interview video uploaded on March 19, 2024, one day after the conclusion of &quot;Quiet on Set&quot;, Schneider responded to these claims, stating, &quot;It was wrong. It was wrong that I ever put anyone in that position. It was wrong to do. I&#x27;d never do it today. I&#x27;m embarrassed that I did it then. I apologize to anybody that I ever put in that situation&quot;. Regarding Bell&#x27;s experience, Schneider, who denied involvement in the network&#x27;s decision to hire Peck, stated, &quot;When Drake and I talked and he told me about what happened, I was more devastated by that than anything that ever happened to me in my career thus far&quot;, and provided support for Bell.

Following the &quot;Quiet on Set&quot; revelations, Bell reported on social media that his &quot;Amanda Show&quot; and &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; co-star Josh Peck had &quot;reached out to talk with me and help me work through this. And has been really, really great.&quot;

==Release==
===Broadcast===
&quot;The Amanda Show&quot; premiered on Nickelodeon&#x27;s 8:30 PM segment of SNICK on October 16, 1999, and new episodes aired until September 21, 2002. Nickelodeon carried reruns of &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; during its TEENick block until September 5, 2007. On October 13, 2007, reruns started airing as part of the &quot;TEENick on The N&quot; block on The N. Reruns were pulled in March 2008 before airing again from April 4, 2009, to August 3, 2009. The series&#x27; original TV rating was TV-Y7, but was changed to TV-G, like all of the other shows that aired on the former TEENick block on Nickelodeon.

On July 11, 2011, the British Nicktoons channel began airing the series; it showed weekdays at 9:00 p.m. Some episodes missing from broadcast included three episodes (episodes 3, 8, 11 and 12) from Season 1, three Season 2 episodes (episodes 3, 7 and 14), and four episodes from Season 3 (episodes 1, 2, 6 and 10). Reasons for these episodes not being shown are unknown.

Nickelodeon Canada began airing the series on September 5, 2011, with the exception of Season 1 episodes 8 and 12 (which featured musical guests), and Season 3 episode 11. The series was removed from the schedule on June 3, 2013.

Reruns of &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; started airing on TeenNick on October 11, 2011. Although it was originally announced as part of TeenNick&#x27;s 1990s block &quot;The &#x27;90s Are All That&quot;, the series instead aired as a standalone series during the daytime. The show would later return on September 17, 2012, and aired in two-hour blocks, until being removed again on March 17, 2013. The series later premiered on The Splat (later NickSplat and NickRewind) on June 10, 2016, and on August 27, 2017, as part of a SNICK 25th anniversary marathon, before briefly returning again in 2020.

===Home media and streaming services===
Three volumes of &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; were released on VHS and DVD beginning on October 5, 2004. Four &quot;Best Of&quot; volumes released exclusively on iTunes from 2008 to 2013. Later manufacture-on-demand releases were made available through Amazon beginning on March 12, 2012. Two releases, &quot;Volume 4: Penelope&#x27;s Picks&quot; and &quot;Volume 5: Trudy&#x27;s Duties&quot;, were canceled after initially being scheduled to release on July 12, 2005, and September 20, 2005, respectively.

As of March 2021, the show is available to stream on Paramount+, without the four episodes excluded on DVD (1, 5, 8, and 12).

==Reception==
&quot;The Amanda Show&quot; has been met with mostly positive reviews since its premiere. Within weeks of its debut, AmandaPlease.com, the series&#x27; official website, had attracted 150,000 hits and received 16,000 emails. The series became the highest-rated live-action program on Nickelodeon during its run, and its primetime slot in Nickelodeon&#x27;s SNICK block, which was shared with &quot;100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd&quot;, further boosted its popularity. Bynes commented on her stardom in a 2000 interview, stating, &quot;It feels like it&#x27;s unreal. &quot;[...]&quot; I love doing what I&#x27;m doing. And for kids to watch me and come up to me and say they want to be like me, it&#x27;s a really big honor.&quot;

Dan Schneider, creator and producer of the series, spoke highly of Bynes&#x27; talent on &quot;All That&quot; as it progressed to the star&#x27;s spin-off series, stating, &quot;You have to feed kids the material; you do have to invent it for them. A lot of kids can regurgitate lines -- the Olsen twins when they first started on &quot;Full House&quot;. Schneider further stated, &quot;To find a kid who can play the daughter or son on a sitcom is tough, but to find a kid who can do what Dana Carvey and Eddie Murphy do, you (have to) look at 2,000 before you find her. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like Amanda.&quot;

In a review from the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;, the series was described as &quot;constant beating-up, peeing, zits, flatulenct, etc. Much of the time, it didn&#x27;t even make sense.&quot;

Bynes was a breakout star from working on &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; and experienced high commercial success since, starring in a variety of projects such as &quot;She&#x27;s the Man&quot; (2006), &quot;Hairspray&quot; (2007), and &quot;Easy A&quot; (2010), before taking a hiatus from entertainment to focus on her mental health amid struggles with drugs and alcohol.

<doc id="388022" wikidata="Q5866431" url="?curid=388022" title="History of Seattle">
<text>This is the main article of a series that covers the history of [[Seattle]], Washington, a city in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States of America.

Seattle is a major port city that has a history of boom and bust. Seattle has on several occasions been sent into severe decline, but has typically used those periods to successfully rebuild infrastructure. There have been at least five such cycles:
* The lumber-industry boom, followed by the construction of an Olmsted-designed park system.
* The Klondike gold rush started in 1896, but reached Seattle in July 1897. This constituted the largest boom for Seattle proportional to the city&#x27;s size at the time, and ended the economic woes Seattle (and the nation) had been suffering since the Panic of 1893.
* The shipbuilding boom, which peaked during World War I and crashed immediately thereafter, followed by the unused city development plan of Virgil Bogue.
* The Boeing boom, followed by general infrastructure building.
* Most recently, the boom based on Microsoft and other software, web, and telecommunications companies, such as Amazon, AT&amp;T Wireless, and RealNetworks.
==Early history of Seattle==


What is now Seattle has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 B.C.—10,000 years ago), for at least 4,000 years. In the mid-1850s the Coast Salish people of what is now called the Duwamish Tribe and Suquamish, as well as other associated groups and tribes, were living in some 13 villages within the present-day city limits of Seattle. Evidence of continuous human habitation of a village site within the current city limits of the city of Seattle dating back to the 6th century C.E. exists on the Port of Seattle Terminal 107 site, located on the Western bank of the Duwamish River. The site was abandoned in approximately 1800, for unknown reasons. Other notable village sites include the birthplace of Chief Seattle, which was located near the current footprint of the King Street Station.

George Vancouver was the first European to visit the Seattle area in May 1792 during his 1791-95 expedition to chart the Pacific Northwest.

The founding of Seattle is usually dated from the arrival of the Denny Party scouts on September 25, 1851. However, Luther Collins, Henry Van Asselt, and the Maple family founded a farming settlement on what is currently the Seattle neighborhood of Georgetown on September 27, 1851. The Denny party&#x27;s original site was an unfinished cabin, without roof, and a camp site, located at Alki Point, in West Seattle. The Collins party settlement was improved with permanent structures, and was soon producing produce and meat for sale and barter. In April, 1852, Arthur A. Denny abandoned the original site at Alki in favor of a better protected site on Elliott Bay that is now part of downtown Seattle. Arthur A. Denny and Luther Collins were the first commissioners of King County after its creation in 1852. Around the same time, David Swinson &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard began settling the land immediately south of Denny&#x27;s.

Seattle in its early decades relied on the timber industry, shipping logs (and later, milled timber) to San Francisco. A climax forest of trees up to 1,000–2,000 years old and towering as high as nearly 400 ft (122 m) covered much of what is now Seattle. Today, none of that size remain anywhere in the world.

When Henry Yesler brought the first steam sawmill to the region, he chose a location on the waterfront where Maynard and Denny&#x27;s plats met. Thereafter Seattle would dominate the lumber industry.

Charlie Terry sold out Alki (which, after his departure barely held on as a settlement), moved to Seattle and began acquiring land. He either owned or partially owned Seattle&#x27;s first timber ships. He eventually gave a land grant to the University of the Territory of Washington (later University of Washington), and was instrumental in the politics to establish an urban infrastructure.

The logging town developed rapidly over decades into a small city. Despite being officially founded by the Methodists of the Denny Party, Seattle quickly developed a reputation as a wide-open town, a haven for prostitution, liquor, and gambling. Some attribute this, at least in part, to Maynard who realized that something was needed to bring the loggers and sailors, who formed the majority of the surrounding population, to town.

Real estate records show that nearly all of the city&#x27;s first 60 businesses were on, or immediately adjacent to, Maynard&#x27;s plat.

All of this occurred against a background of sometimes rocky relations with the local Native American population, including a nominally pitched battle, the Battle of Seattle, January 25, 1856.

Seattle was incorporated as a town January 14, 1865. That charter was voided January 18, 1867, in response to questionable activities of the town&#x27;s elected leaders. Seattle was re-incorporated December 2, 1869. At the times of incorporations, the population was approximately 350 and 1,000, respectively.

In 1867, a young French Canadian Catholic priest named Francis X. Prefontaine arrived in Seattle and decided to establish a parish there. At that time, Seattle had no Catholic church and few parishioners. Fr. Prefontaine counted only ten Catholics in the town and only three attended the first mass that he conducted. His bishop, Augustin-Magloire Blanchet, whose cathedra was in Vancouver, Washington, gave Fr. Prefontaine permission to build a church there, as long as the priest could raise the funds himself and it would cost the diocese nothing. Prefontaine raised the money by holding fairs around the Puget Sound area. During 1868–69 he built the church, doing much of the work himself, and in 1869 he opened Seattle&#x27;s first Catholic church at Third Avenue and Washington Street, on the site where the present-day Prefontaine Building stands.
===Railroad rivalry and encroaching civilization===
On July 14, 1873, the Northern Pacific Railway announced that they had chosen the then-village of Tacoma over Seattle as the Western terminus of their transcontinental railroad. The railroad barons appear to have been gambling on the advantage they could gain from being able to buy up the land around their terminus cheaply instead of bringing the railroad into a more established Pacific port town.

Seattle made several attempts to build a railroad of its own or to leverage one to come. The Great Northern Railway finally came to Seattle in 1884, winning Seattle a place in competition for freight, though it would be 1906 before Seattle finally acquired a major rail passenger terminal.

Seattle in this era was a freebooting and often relatively lawless town. Although it boasted newspapers and telephones, lynch law often prevailed (there were at least four deaths by lynching in 1882), schools barely operated, and indoor plumbing was a rare novelty. In the low mudflats where much of the city was built, sewage was almost as likely to come in on the tide as to flow away. 

Union organizing first arrived in the form of a skilled craft union. In 1882, Seattle printers formed the Seattle Typographical Union Local 202. Dockworkers followed in 1886, cigarmakers in 1887, tailors in 1889, and both brewers and musicians in 1890. Even the newsboys unionized in 1892, followed by more organizing, mostly of craft unions.

The history of labor in the American West in this period is inseparable from the issue of anti-Chinese vigilantism. In 1883 Chinese laborers played a key role in the first effort at digging the Montlake Cut to connect Lake Union&#x27;s Portage Bay to Lake Washington&#x27;s Union Bay. In 1885–1886, whites—sometimes in combination with Indians—complaining of overly cheap labor competition, drove the Chinese settlers from Seattle, Tacoma, and other Northwest cities.

In an era during which the Washington Territory was one of the first parts of the U.S. to (briefly) allow women&#x27;s suffrage, women played a significant part in &quot;civilizing&quot; Seattle.

The first bathtub with plumbing was in 1870. In the 1880s, Seattle got its first streetcar and cable car, ferry service, a YMCA gymnasium, and the exclusive Rainier Club, and passed an ordinance requiring attached sewer lines for all new residences. It also began to develop a road system.

The relative fortunes of Seattle and Tacoma clearly show the nature of Seattle&#x27;s growth. Though both Seattle and Tacoma grew at a rapid rate from 1880 to 1890, based on the strength of their timber industries, Seattle&#x27;s growth as an exporter of services and manufactured goods continued for another two decades, while Tacoma&#x27;s growth dropped almost to zero. The reason for this lies in Tacoma&#x27;s nature as a company town and Seattle&#x27;s successful avoidance of that condition.

===The Great Fire===
The early Seattle era came to a stunning halt with the Great Seattle Fire of June 6, 1889. Started by a glue pot, the fire burned 29 city blocks (almost entirely wooden buildings; about 10 brick buildings also burned). It destroyed nearly the entire business district, all of the railroad terminals, and all but four of the wharves. Major fires like this were common in Washington that summer: the center of Ellensburg was destroyed by fire on July 4 and downtown Spokane burned on August 4.

Thanks in part to credit arranged by Jacob Furth, Seattle rebuilt from the ashes with astounding rapidity. A new zoning code resulted in a downtown of brick and stone buildings, rather than wood. In the single year after the fire, the city grew from 25,000 to 40,000 inhabitants, largely because of the enormous number of construction jobs suddenly created.

Still, south of Yesler Way, the open city atmosphere remained.

===The Klondike Gold Rush===

The greatest boom period for Seattle occurred during the Klondike gold rush. Seattle, as well as the rest of the nation, was suffering from the economic panic of 1893, and to a lesser extent, the panic of 1896. Gold was discovered in August 1896 in the Klondike region of Canada. Almost one year later, on July 17, 1897, the steamer &quot;Portland&quot; arrived at Schwabacher&#x27;s Wharf in Seattle. A publicity campaign engineered largely by Erastus Brainerd told the world of the &quot;Portland&#x27;s&quot; &quot;ton of gold,&quot; started the Klondike gold rush, and established Seattle as its supply center and the jumping-off point for transportation to and from Alaska and the gold fields of the Yukon. The rush ended the depression overnight for Seattle.

==Beginning of the 20th century==
===Leader of the Northwest: 1900–1915===

The gold rush led to massive immigration. Many of Seattle&#x27;s neighborhoods got their start around this time. Downtown Seattle was bustling with activity; as quickly as previous inhabitants moved out to newly created neighborhoods, new immigrants came in to take their place in the city core.

Once the obvious extensions of downtown had been made along the flatlands to the north and south, streetcars began providing transportation to new outlying neighborhoods.

Following the vision of city engineer R.H. Thomson, who had already played a key role in the development of municipal utilities, a massive effort was made to level the steep hills that rose south and north of the bustling city. A seawall containing spoils (dirt) sluiced from the Denny Regrade created the current waterfront. More spoils from the Denny Regrade went to build the industrial Harbor Island at the mouth of the Duwamish River, south of Downtown.

The Denny Regrade wasn&#x27;t the only radical reshaping of Seattle&#x27;s topography in this period. The slightly earlier Jackson Regrade had already reshaped Pioneer Square and the International District. The 1911–1917 construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal included two major &quot;cuts&quot; (the Montlake Cut and the Fremont Cut), four bascule bridges, and the Government Locks (now Hiram M. Chittenden Locks). The level of Lake Washington dropped; the Black River, which formerly ran out of the south end of the lake, dried up completely, and Seward Island became the Seward Peninsula, now the site of Seward Park.

All of the expansion was happening without zoning, leading to &quot;different land uses and economic classes everywhere [being] mixed.&quot;

At the same time as the city was expanding dramatically, the city planners began to put in parks and boulevards under a plan designed by the Olmsted Firm, providing numerous parks and about twenty miles of boulevard which link most of the parks and greenbelts within the city limits. Much of the ambiance of Seattle today derives from this project.

Where there had so recently been wilderness, increasingly there was the reality of a major city. The Seattle Symphony was founded in 1903, and while few, if any, other comparably important arts institutions were established, the story was different in more popular entertainments. Vaudeville impresarios Alexander Pantages, John Considine, and John Cort (the last also involved in legitimate theater) were all based in Seattle in this era.

The progressive school board hired a new superintendent in 1901, Frank B. Cooper, who oversaw a program of building many new schools in Seattle&#x27;s neighborhoods. The schools expanded their curriculum from the basic core to include music and art, physical education, vocational training, and programs for immigrants and special needs students.

As a major port Seattle depended heavily on its waterfront. Before 1911 it was a confused jumble of private rail lines and docks. The progressive reformers rationalized the system by building a port owned and operated by local government. The efficient new system allowed Seattle to expand after 1945 with the Sea-Tac airport, and enabled Seattle to become one of the first Pacific Coast ports to move to containerized shipping and thus expand business with Asia.

Seattle trumpeted and celebrated its rise with the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909, but the city&#x27;s rapid growth had led to much questioning of the social order. Not only the labor left, but also progressives calling for &quot;good government&quot; challenged the hegemony of the captains of industry. Rail baron James J. Hill, addressing Seattle business leaders in 1909, noted and regretted the change. &quot;Where,&quot; he asked, &quot;are the man who used to match your mountains...?&quot;

Religion was less of a force in Seattle than in eastern cities, but the Protestant Social Gospel movement had a national leader in the Rev. Mark A. Matthews (1867-1940) of Seattle&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church. He was a tireless reformer who investigated red light districts and crime scenes, denouncing corrupt politicians, businessmen and saloon keepers. With 10,000 members, his was the largest Presbyterian Church in the country, and he was selected the denomination&#x27;s national moderator in 1912. He built a model church, with night schools, unemployment bureaus, a kindergarten, Anti-tuberculosis clinics, and America&#x27;s first church-owned radio station. Matthews was the most influential clergymen in the Pacific Northwest.

===World War I and after===
In 1910, Seattle voters approved a referendum to create a development plan for the whole city. However, the result, known as the Bogue plan, was never to be implemented. The unused plan had at its heart a grand civic center in Belltown and the Denny Triangle connected to the rest of the city by a rapid transit rail system, with a huge expansion of the park system, crowned by a total conversion of Mercer Island into parkland. However, the plan was defeated by an alliance of fiscal conservatives who opposed such a purportedly grandiose plan on general principles and populists who argued that the plan would mainly benefit the rich.

Growth during this 1910s was almost all in lumber and maritime industries. With the Atlantic a scene of belligerency, World War I increased Pacific maritime trade and caused a boom in shipbuilding, there was very little growth in new industries. When the war ended, economic output crashed as the government stopped buying boats, and there were no new industries to pick up the slack. Seattle stopped being the place of explosive growth and opportunity it had been for two consecutive decades.

After the war, Western Washington was a center of radical labor agitation. Most dramatically, in 1919, a dispute over post-war lowering of waterfront wages spread to become the Seattle General Strike. The Industrial Workers of the World played a prominent role in the strike. Seattle mayor Ole Hanson became a prominent figure in the First Red Scare, and made an unsuccessful attempt to ride that backlash to the White House in an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for the presidential election of 1920.

Although no longer the economic powerhouse it had been at the turn of the century, Seattle first began seriously to be an arts center in the 1920s. The Frye and Henry families put on public display the collections that would become the core of the Frye Art Museum and Henry Art Gallery, respectively. Australian painter Ambrose Patterson arrived in 1919; over the next few decades Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Kenneth Callahan, Guy Irving Anderson, and Paul Horiuchi would establish themselves as nationally and internationally known artists. Bandleader Vic Meyers and others kept the speakeasies jumping through the Prohibition era, and by mid-century the thriving jazz scene in the city&#x27;s Skid Road district would launch the careers of musicians including Ray Charles and Quincy Jones.

In 1924, Seattle&#x27;s Sand Point Airfield was the endpoint of the first aerial circumnavigation of the world. The historic flight helped convince Congress to develop Sand Point as a Naval Air Station.

The Great Depression hit Seattle hard. For example, Seattle issued 2,538 permits for housing construction in 1930, but only 361 in 1932. During the Maritime Strike of 1934, Smith Cove was nearly a battle zone; shippers were scared, to the point where Seattle lost most of its Asian trade to Los Angeles.

==World War II==

Following Japan&#x27;s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. entered World War II and the whole Puget Sound region was full on rolling in the nation&#x27;s war effort. Among the chief priority was the federal government&#x27;s sudden desire for tens of thousands of planes a year, and Boeing was positioned to provide them. Working under fixed-fee contracts, Boeing churned out aircraft and became by far the largest employer in Seattle. During the war, Seattle ranked as one of the top three cities in the nation in contracts per capita, and Washington state ranked as one of the top two in the nation for war contracts per capita. Seattle and Renton produced 8,200 planes, including 6,981 B-17s and more than 1,000 B-29 bombers. Civilian use of Boeing Field was greatly curtailed to accommodate the production of thousands of Boeing bombers. To accommodate the war effort, the U.S. military also annexed McChord Field in Tacoma, prompting that city to plead with the Port of Seattle to develop Seattle-Tacoma International Airport at Bow Lake -- midway between the Sound&#x27;s two major cities.
Puget Sound-area shipyards constructed a large number of war vessels. At the combined Todd Shipyards/Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding operation, 33,000 men and women worked in Tacoma to build five freighters, two transports, 37 escort carriers, five gasoline tankers, and three destroyer tenders. At the Seattle yards, 22,000 employees built 46 destroyers and three tenders for the United States Navy, plus other vessels. The Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, now annexed to Kirkland, employed 6,000 workers to repair dozens of merchant vessels and ferries during the war and to turn out ships for the Navy. The shipyard site is now the location of Carillon Point, a residential-commercial development. 15 smaller shipyards in Seattle and other cities in the Puget Sound area also produced vessels for the war effort.

The war also attracted tens of thousands of workers from across the country, as the greatly expanded wartime production quickly exhausted local labor pools. Of the five million rural southern African-Americans migrating to the industrial North and West during the second wave of the Great Migration, an estimated 45,000 went to the Pacific Northwest, of which 10,000 moved to Seattle. Most African American workers came to Seattle as shipyard employees, and by summer 1942, the National Youth Administration brought to the city the first group of blacks to work for Boeing. By war&#x27;s end, 4,078 (7 percent) of the 60,328 shipyard workers in Seattle were African Americans. AA&#x27;s also found work as non-military government employees. Of 18,862 federal employees in Seattle in 1945, 1,019 (5 percent) were black. Moreover, the 4,000 black soldiers and sailors stationed at Fort Lawton in Seattle and other military installations nearby contributed to the new employment diversity of the African American population. As a result, between 1940 and 1950, Seattle&#x27;s black population grew 413 percent, from 3,789 to 15,666. The newcomers became permanent residents, building up black political influence, strengthening civil rights organizations such as the NAACP, and calling for antidiscrimination legislation. On the negative side, racial tensions increased, both black and white residential areas deteriorated from overcrowding, and inside the black community there were angry words between &quot;old settlers&quot; and recent arrivals for leadership in the black communities.

===Japanese American community===

Japanese-Americans living in the Pacific Northwest were heavily affected by the war; President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the removal of 110,000 Japanese immigrants and ethnic Japanese citizens from the West Coast to internment camps inland, relocating 7,000 people from the Seattle area alone. Seattle&#x27;s Japantown, once the 2nd largest in the nation, was emptied. Local grocers and the Pike Place Market lost the bounty of hundreds of Japanese American truck farms, including the 55 families who had produced famed strawberries in Bellevue. Although most of their neighbors acquiesced to the internment of Japanese Americans, a few community leaders questioned its validity or necessity. Tacoma Mayor Harry P. Cain said, &quot;America has always been interested in selection, and I feel it would be preferable to make careful selection of those who are evacuated then just to say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s get rid of our problem by the easiest, most obvious way, by moving everybody out&#x27;&quot;.

==Post-war boom 1945–1970==
After the war ended, the military canceled its bomber orders; Boeing factories shut down and 70,000 people lost their jobs, and initially it appeared that Seattle had little to show for the wartime Boeing boom. However, this period of stagnation soon ended with the rise of the jet aircraft and Boeing&#x27;s reincarnation as the world&#x27;s leading producer of commercial passenger planes.

With all the post-war growth came growing pollution of the lakes and rivers that provided much of beauty that had been Seattle&#x27;s appeal to its recent immigrants. Also, the sprawl constantly demanded more roads, since the ones already built had terrible traffic. Jim Ellis and other Seattle natives, anxious to preserve the city in which they grew up, came together to institute the Metropolitan Problems Committee, or METRO, intended to manage and plan the metropolitan area. The original, comprehensive METRO regional plan was defeated in a vote by the suburbanites;
METRO came back, scaled down to a sewage treatment and transport organization; METRO was eventually merged into the King County government.

During this period, Seattle attempted to counter the decline of its downtown and the area immediately to the north by hosting the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair. The fair, given a futuristic science theme, was designed to leave behind a civic center, now known as Seattle Center, including arts buildings, the Pacific Science Center and the Space Needle, and serving also as a fairground. In addition, freeways were built to compensate for all this new growth for people to commute. Most of the Eastside (east of Lake Washington) and northern suburbs came into being during the Boeing boom, as did Interstate Highways (I-5 and I-90). I-5 cut off Downtown Seattle from Capitol Hill and First Hill.

In conjunction with the fair, a demonstration monorail line was constructed at no cost to the city and was paid for out of ticket sales, and then turned over to the city for $600,000. &quot;(See Seattle Center Monorail.)&quot; It is now mostly a tourist attraction. The World&#x27;s Fair arguably reenergized the downtown of Seattle, and was generally a smashing success, even finishing with a profit.

After the war, the University of Washington also took a step forward, finally fulfilling the promise of its name under university president Charles Odegaard. Starting in the late 1950s, Seattle was one of the centers of the emergence of the American counter-culture and culture of protest. Before grunge there were beats, fringies (a local Seattle term), hippies, and batcavers.

===The Boeing Bust===
Due to the simultaneous decline in Vietnam War military spending, the slowing of the space program as Project Apollo neared completion, the recession of 1969-1970, the cancellation of the supersonic transport (SST), and Boeing&#x27;s $2 billion in debt as it built the 747 airliner, the company and the Seattle area greatly suffered. Commercial Airplane Group, by far the largest unit of Boeing, went from 83,700 employees in 1968 to 20,750 in 1971. Each unemployed Boeing employee cost at least one other job, and unemployment rose to 14%, the highest in the United States. Housing vacancy rates rose to 16% from 1% in 1967. U-Haul dealerships ran out of trailers because so many people moved out. A billboard appeared near the airport:

After 1973, Seattle was in good company for its recession, since the rest of the country was also experiencing the energy crisis.
Pike Place Market, arguably Seattle&#x27;s most important tourist attraction, gained its modern form in the aftermath of the Boeing crash. The internment of Seattle&#x27;s Japanese-Americans during World War II had hit the market particularly hard, since 80% of its &quot;wet stall&quot; vendors had been ethnically Japanese. A &quot;Keep the Market&quot; initiative led by architect Victor Steinbrueck, passed in 1971, pushing for adaptive reuse. The project was wildly successful in spite of intense opposition by the Seattle Establishment, and today the Pike Place Market pulls in nine million visitors each year.

A similar story occurred with Pioneer Square. An old neighborhood, largely built after the Fire of 1889, it had fallen into derelict status after the war. However, with a reenergized downtown, businesses started to look for buildings that could be acquired cheaply. When offices moved into renovated buildings, suddenly there was a market for facilities to service them, leading to a &quot;flood of other restaurants, galleries, boutiques.&quot; Seattle was definitely recovering from the blow dealt by the Boeing recession, refilling areas that had threatened to become slums.

==High tech: 1970 onwards==
In 1979, Bill Gates (1955–) and Paul Allen (1953–2018), founders of Microsoft, moved their small company from New Mexico to the suburbs of their native Seattle. By 1985, sales were over $140 million, by 1990, $1.18 billion, and by 1995, Microsoft was the world&#x27;s most profitable corporation, Allen and Gates were billionaires, and thousands of their past and present employees were millionaires. Microsoft spawned a host of other companies in the Seattle area: millionaire employees often left to found their own companies, and Allen, after his own departure from Microsoft, became a major investor in new companies. Seattle-area companies that owe their origins at least indirectly to Microsoft include RealNetworks, AttachmateWRQ, InfoSpace, and a host of others. Quite unlike Boeing, Microsoft has served as a catalyst for the creation of a whole realm of industry. Microsoft has also taken a much more active hand than Boeing in public works in the area, donating software to many schools (including the University of Washington).

Seattle has also been experiencing quite good growth in the biotechnology and coffee sectors, with international coffeeshop chain Starbucks originating from Seattle, and Seattle-based Nordstrom now a national brand.

Paul Allen, whose fortune was made through Microsoft though he had long since ceased to be an active participant in the company, was a major force in Seattle politics. He attempted a voter initiative to build the Seattle Commons, a huge park in South Lake Union and the Cascade District, and even offered to put up his own money to endow a security force for the park, but it was defeated at the polls. (Allen then became the leader of the movement to redevelop this same area as a biotech center.) He did get a football stadium for the Seattle Seahawks through a successful statewide ballot initiative, and founded the Experience Music Project (originally intended as a Jimi Hendrix museum) on the grounds of Seattle Center.

Seattle&#x27;s bid for the world stage by hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 did not play out as planned. Instead, the city became the site of the first great street confrontation between the anti-globalization movement and the World Trade Organization on November 30, 1999. While many of those in the streets, and most of those in the suites, were from out of town or even out of country, much of the groundwork of Seattle hosting both the event and the protests against it can be attributed to local forces. In 2001 the central city was the site of rioting, mixed with partying and racially motivated violence against European Americans in the Seattle Mardi Gras riot. Seattle along with other west coast cities experienced politically inspired confrontations and violence during the May Day marches in 2015.

Seattle today is physically similar to the Seattle of the 1960s, while the demographics have begun to shift over time. It is still filled with single-family households, with whites making up 64.9% of the population (down from a high of 91.6% in 1960), Asians 16.3%, two or more races 8.8%, Black 6.8%, and Hispanic 7.2%. The city is politically still largely progressive, with about three quarters of a million people.

In 2023, Seattle became the first city in the United States to ban discrimination based on caste.

<text>South Hwanghae Province (Hwanghaenamdo; , lit. &quot;south Yellow Sea province&quot;) is a province in western North Korea. The province was formed in 1954 when the former Hwanghae Province was split into North and South Hwanghae. The provincial capital is Haeju.

==Geography==
The province is part of the Haeso region, and is bounded to the west by the Yellow Sea, and to the north and east by North Hwanghae province. Some administrative exclaves of Nampo City in the north of the province exist. The southern border of the province is marked by the Korean Demilitarized Zone with South Korea. The province draws its name from what were the largest cities in Hwanghae, Haeju and Hwangju; the name, which literally means &quot;Yellow Sea&quot; in Korean, also references the Yellow Sea, which forms the province&#x27;s western bound.

The coastline of South Hwanghae is dotted by many small islands, many of which are uninhabited. Many of the largest islands, such as Baengnyeong-do are administered by South Korea. The Northern Limit Line, which runs through the region and demarcates a disputed maritime boundary between the north and south, is another frequent subject of contention between the two countries. The largest islands which indisputably belong to North Korea are Kirin-do, Changrin-do, and Sunwi-do.

The province, being not very mountainous, is uniquely suited to farming, and is thus often referred to as the &quot;bread-basket&quot; of North Korea. Much of the land is devoted to farming and thus was not hit as hard as other parts of the country during the Arduous March of the 1990s. Many types of vegetables, fruits, grains, and rice are grown on the region&#x27;s plains; Kwail County, which means fruit in Korean, was founded to grow orchards.

Haeju, the provincial capital, is also the largest port in southern North Korea outside of Wonsan. The area is also home to several ancient burial mounds and cultural relics, such as the Kangsosa Buddhist temple, ancient stone pagodas, and a Koryo-era ice house. There are also many Iron Age dolmen and Koguryo tombs in the province, such as Anak Tomb No.3.

==Administrative divisions==

South Hwanghae is divided into 1 city (&quot;si&quot;) and 19 counties (&quot;gun&quot;). These are further divided into villages (&quot;ri&quot;) in rural areas and &quot;dong&quot; (neighborhoods) in cities, which are detailed on each county&#x27;s individual page.

<doc id="388027" wikidata="Q210730" url="?curid=388027" title="Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot">
<text>Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot (26 February 1725 – 2 October 1804) was a French inventor who built the world&#x27;s first full-size and working self-propelled mechanical land-vehicle, the &quot;Fardier à vapeur&quot; – effectively the world&#x27;s first automobile.

== Background ==
He was born in Void-Vacon, Lorraine, (now &quot;&quot; of Meuse), France. He trained as a military engineer. In 1765, he began experimenting with working models of steam-engine-powered vehicles for the French Army, intended for transporting cannons.

== First self-propelled vehicle ==
French Army captain Cugnot was one of the first to successfully employ a device for converting the reciprocating motion of a steam piston into a rotary motion by means of a ratchet arrangement. A small version of his three-wheeled &quot;fardier à vapeur&quot; (&quot;steam &quot;) was made and used in 1769 (a &quot;fardier&quot; was a massively built two-wheeled horse-drawn cart for transporting very heavy equipment, such as cannon barrels)
In 1770, a full-size version of the &quot;fardier à vapeur&quot; was built, specified to be able to carry four tons and cover two &quot;lieue&quot; (7.8 km, or 4.8 miles) in one hour, a performance it never achieved in practice. The vehicle weighed about 2.5 tonnes tare, and 2.8 tonnes full, and had two wheels at the rear and one in the front where the horses would normally have been. The front wheel supported a steam boiler and driving mechanism. The power unit was articulated to the &quot;trailer&quot;, and was steered from there by means of a double handle arrangement. One source states that it seated four passengers and moved at a speed of .
The vehicle was reported to have been very unstable owing to poor weight distribution, a serious disadvantage for a vehicle intended to be able to traverse rough terrain and climb steep hills. In addition, boiler performance was also particularly poor, even by the standards of the day. The vehicle&#x27;s fire needed to be relit, and its steam raised again, every quarter of an hour or so, which considerably reduced its overall speed and distance.

After running a small number of trials, variously described as being between Paris and Vincennes and at Meudon, the project was abandoned. This ended the French Army&#x27;s first experiment with mechanical vehicles. Even so, in 1772, King Louis XV granted Cugnot a pension of 600 &quot;livres&quot; a year for his innovative work, and the experiment was judged interesting enough for the &quot;fardier&quot; to be kept at the arsenal. In 1800 it was transferred to the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, where it can still be seen today.

241 years later, in 2010, a copy of the &quot;fardier de Cugnot&quot; was built by students from ParisTech, in conjunction with Cugnot&#x27;s native commune of Void-Vacon. This replica worked perfectly, demonstrating the validity of the concept and the veracity of the tests carried out in 1769. The replica was exhibited at the 2010 Paris Motor Show before returning for exhibit in Void-Vacon.

== First automobile accident ==

There are reports of a minor incident in 1771, when the second prototype vehicle is said to have accidentally knocked down a brick or stone wall, either that of a Paris garden or part of the Paris Arsenal walls, in perhaps the first known automobile accident. The incident is unrecorded in contemporary accounts, first appearing in 1804, thirty-three years after the alleged accident. Nevertheless, the story persists that Cugnot was arrested and convicted of dangerous driving, another first for him if true.
== Later life ==
Following the French Revolution, Cugnot&#x27;s pension was withdrawn in 1789 and he went into exile in Brussels where he lived in poverty. Shortly before his death, Cugnot&#x27;s pension was restored by Napoleon Bonaparte and he eventually returned to Paris where he died on 2 October 1804.

<text>David Edward Leslie Hemmings (18 November 1941 – 3 December 2003) was an English actor, director, and producer of film and television. Originally trained as a boy soprano in operatic roles, he began appearing in films as a child actor in the 1950s. He became an icon of Swinging London for his portrayal of a trendy fashion photographer in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966), directed by Michelangelo Antonioni.

During the 1960s and 70s, Hemmings played both leading roles and major supporting parts in films like &quot;Camelot&quot; (1967), &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968), &quot;Barbarella&quot; (also 1968), &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; (1969), &quot;The Walking Stick&quot; (1970), &quot;Juggernaut&quot; (1974), &quot;Deep Red&quot; (1975), &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (also 1977). In 1967, he co-founded the Hemdale Film Corporation with John Daly.

From the late 1970s on, Hemmings appeared mainly in supporting roles, and increasingly as a director. His second feature film, &quot;The 14&quot; (1973), won the Silver Bear at the 23rd Berlin International Film Festival. He directed the cult horror film &quot;The Survivor&quot; (1981) in Australia. After moving to the United States in the 1980s, he directed episodes of television series like &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; and &quot;The A-Team&quot;. He continued acting in major motion pictures, notably &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000) and &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2001), until his death in 2003.

==Early life==
David Hemmings was born in Guildford, Surrey, to a father who was a biscuit salesman and a homemaker mother.

===Benjamin Britten===
His education at Alleyn&#x27;s School, Glyn Grammar School in Ewell and the Arts Educational Schools led him to music performance at the start of his career. He sang as a boy soprano in several works by composer Benjamin Britten, who formed a close friendship with him at this time. Most notably Hemmings created the role of Miles in Britten&#x27;s chamber opera &quot;Turn of the Screw&quot; (1954). His intimate yet non-sexual relationship with Britten is described in John Bridcut&#x27;s book &quot;Britten&#x27;s Children&quot; (2006).

Although many commentators identified Britten&#x27;s relationship with Hemmings as based on an infatuation, throughout his life Hemmings maintained categorically that Britten&#x27;s conduct with him was beyond reproach at all times. Hemmings had earlier played the title role in Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Little Sweep&quot; (1952), which was part of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Make an Opera!&quot; children&#x27;s production.

Britten&#x27;s interest in Hemmings ceased abruptly from the moment his voice broke, which occurred unexpectedly while he was singing the aria &#x27;Malo&#x27; during a performance of &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; in 1956 in Paris. Britten was furious, waved Hemmings away, and never had any further contact with him.

==Acting==
===Early career===
Hemmings then moved on to acting in films. He made his first film appearance in the drama film &quot;The Rainbow Jacket&quot; (1954). He also appeared in &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1957).

Hemmings had bigger roles in &quot;Five Clues to Fortune&quot; (1957), &quot;The Heart Within&quot; (1957) and &quot;No Trees in the Street&quot; (1959), directed by J. Lee Thompson. He also had roles in &quot;Men of Tomorrow&quot; (1959), &quot;In the Wake of a Stranger&quot; (1959), &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Wind of Change&quot; (1961).

Hemmings began to be known for playing young men, for example in &quot;The Painted Smile&quot; (1962) and &quot;Some People&quot; (1962). His first lead role was in the low budget teen musical &quot;Live It Up!&quot; (1963), then he had support roles for Michael Winner&#x27;s &quot;The System&quot; (1964). After this, he starred in a sequel to &quot;Live It Up!&quot;, &quot;Be My Guest&quot; (1965) and in the same year in &quot;Two Left Feet&quot; with Michael Crawford.

===&quot;Blowup&quot; and stardom===
Hemmings’ luck changed when he was cast in the lead of &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966). It was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, who detested the &quot;Method&quot; way of acting. He sought a fresh young face for the lead in the film. He found Hemmings, at the time acting in small-stage theatre in London, although at their first meeting Antonioni told Hemmings, &quot;You look wrong. You&#x27;re too young.&quot; Hemmings was offered the part of the protagonist, a London fashion photographer who accidentally photographs evidence of a murder, after Sean Connery turned the role down because Antonioni would not show him the full script but only a seven-page treatment stored in a cigarette packet.

The resulting film was a critical and commercial sensation for MGM, which financed it, and helped turn Hemmings and Vanessa Redgrave into stars. &quot;I&#x27;ve been discovered half a dozen times,&quot; said Hemmings. &quot;This time I think I&#x27;ve made it.&quot;

After &quot;Blowup&quot; Hemmings accepted an offer from Warner Bros to play Mordred in the big-budget film of the Broadway musical &quot;Camelot&quot; (1967). He had a supporting part in the thriller &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot; (1966), playing the brother of Sharon Tate. Hemmings was then cast as Louis Nolan in the big-budget epic &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968), which, like &quot;Camelot&quot;, was widely seen but failed to recoup its cost.

Around 1967 Hemmings was briefly considered for the role of Alex in a film version of Anthony Burgess&#x27;s novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1962), which was to be based on a screen treatment by satirist Terry Southern and British photographer Michael Cooper. Cooper and the Rolling Stones were reportedly upset by the move and it was decided to return to the original plan in which Mick Jagger, the lead vocalist of the Rolling Stones, would play Alex, with the rest of the Stones as his droog gang; the production was shelved after Britain&#x27;s chief censor, the Lord Chamberlain, indicated that he would not permit it to be made.

Hemmings costarred with Richard Attenborough in the crime comedy, &quot;Only When I Larf&quot; (1968), then was the sole star of an anti-war film, &quot;The Long Day&#x27;s Dying&quot; (1968). Both films flopped. More financially successful was the science fiction sex comedy &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968), starring Jane Fonda in which Hemmings had a key supporting role. He played the lead in two period films for MGM: a comedy, &quot;The Best House in London&quot; (1969), and the historical epic &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; (1969), in which Hemmings had the title role. Neither film did well at the box office, with &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; being a notable flop.

Hemmings was cast in further lead roles at the start of the 1970s : &quot;The Walking Stick&quot; (1970) with Samantha Eggar for MGM; &quot;Fragment of Fear&quot; (1970), a thriller; and &quot;Unman, Wittering and Zigo&quot; (1971). He went to Hollywood to play a supporting role in &quot;The Love Machine&quot; (1971). Back in Britain he starred in a horror film, &quot;Voices&quot; (1973). He went to Spain to appear in &quot;Lola&quot; (1974) and in Britain supported Richard Harris in &quot;Juggernaut&quot; (1974).

Hemmings appeared in the Italian giallo film &quot;Profondo Rosso&quot; (also known as &quot;Deep Red&quot; or &quot;The Hatchet Murders&quot;) (1975) directed by Dario Argento. Back in England he supported Anthony Newley in &quot;Mister Quilp&quot; (1975).

===Director===
Hemmings first turned to directing with &quot;Running Scared&quot; (1972), an adaptation of an American novel by Gregory Mcdonald for which Hemmings also co-wrote the script, resetting the story from Harvard to Cambridge University. He directed the drama film &quot;The 14&quot; (1973), which won the Silver Bear at the 23rd Berlin International Film Festival.

Hemmings directed David Bowie and Marlene Dietrich in the drama film &quot;Schöner Gigolo, armer Gigolo&quot; (also known as &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot;) (1978). The film was poorly received, with Bowie describing it as &quot;my 32 Elvis Presley films rolled into one&quot;.

Later, after relocating to Hollywood, he directed a number of television films and series episodes.

===Character actor===
From the mid-1970s on, Hemmings&#x27;s acting work was mainly in supporting roles. In 1977 he appeared as Eddy in the film &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, an adaptation of Hemingway&#x27;s novel of the same name, starring George C Scott. He also had support roles in &quot;The Squeeze&quot; (1977), &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1977), &quot;The Heroin Busters&quot; (1977), &quot;The Disappearance&quot; (1977), &quot;Squadra antitruffa&quot; (1977), &quot;Blood Relatives&quot; (1978), &quot;Power Play&quot; (1978) and &quot;Murder by Decree&quot; (1979). He also returned to television in 1978 with a film for Granada TV directed by Ken Russell and written by Melvin Bragg: &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, about Samuel Taylor Coleridge (played by Hemmings), was the second of two films in the &quot;Clouds of Glory&quot; series about poets.

===Australia and New Zealand===
In 1979, Hemmings received an offer to play a supporting role in an Australian vampire film, &quot;Thirst&quot;. He starred in a TV film, &quot;Charlie Muffin&quot; then returned to Australia to feature in &quot;Harlequin&quot; (1980).

Hemmings then received an offer from Antony I. Ginnane to direct the Australian horror film &quot;The Survivor&quot; (1981), based on James Herbert&#x27;s 1976 novel of the same name, starring Robert Powell and Jenny Agutter. Hemmings directed &quot;Race for the Yankee Zephyr&quot; shot in New Zealand.

While in New Zealand Hemmings played roles in &quot;Prisoners&quot; (1981) and &quot;Beyond Reasonable Doubt&quot; (1982).

===Hollywood===
Hemmings then moved to Hollywood. He played supporting roles in &quot;Man, Woman and Child&quot; (1983) and &quot;Airwolf&quot; (1984).

He also worked extensively as a director of television programmes, including the action-adventure drama series &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; (e.g. the series’ premiere); the crime series &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; (in which he also played characters in several episodes); and two action-adventure series, &quot;The A-Team&quot; and &quot;Airwolf&quot; (in which he also played the role of Doctor Charles Henry Moffet, twisted creator of Airwolf, in the pilot and the second-season episode &quot;Moffett&#x27;s Ghost&quot;a typographical error by the studio&#x27;s titles unit). He once joked &quot;People thought I was dead. But I wasn&#x27;t. I was just directing &quot;The A-Team&quot;.&quot;

Hemmings also directed the puzzle-contest video &quot;Money Hunt: The Mystery of the Missing Link&quot; (1984). He directed (and acted in) the television film &quot;The Key to Rebecca&quot; (1985), an adaptation of Ken Follett&#x27;s 1980 novel of the same name. He also briefly served as a producer on the NBC crime-drama television series &quot;Stingray&quot;.

He directed the drama film &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (1992) and as an actor returned to the voyeuristic preoccupations of his &quot;Blowup&quot; character with a plum part as the Big Brother-esque villain in the series-three opener for the television horror anthology series &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot;.

===Later years===
In later years he had roles that included Cassius in the historical epic film &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), with Russell Crowe, and in the drama film &quot;Last Orders&quot; (2001) and the spy film &quot;Spy Game&quot; (2001). He appeared as Mr Schermerhorn in the historical film &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002), directed by Martin Scorsese.

His last screen appearances included the science-fiction action film &quot;Equilibrium&quot; (2002), , the superhero film &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (2003), with Sean Connery, and as Frank Sinatra&#x27;s attorney in the 2003 Australian film &quot;The Night We Called It a Day&quot;, a comedy based on true events. He also appeared in the horror film &quot;Blessed&quot; (2004) with Heather Graham, which was dedicated to his memory after a fatal heart attack while on set.

==Recording career==

In 1967, Hemmings recorded a pop single, &quot;Back Street Mirror&quot; (written by Gene Clark), and a studio album, &quot;David Hemmings Happens&quot;, in Los Angeles. The album featured instrumental backing by several members of the Byrds, and was produced by Byrds&#x27; mentor Jim Dickson.

In the 1970s, he was jointly credited with former Easybeats members Harry Vanda and George Young as a co-composer of the song &quot;Pasadena&quot;. The original 1973 recording of this song – the first Australian hit for singer John Paul Young – was produced by Simon Napier-Bell, in whose SNB Records label Hemmings was a partner at the time.

Hemmings also later provided the narration for Rick Wakeman&#x27;s progressive-rock album &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; (1974) – an adaptation of Jules Verne&#x27;s science-fiction novel &quot;A Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1864) – which was recorded live.

He starred as Bertie Wooster in the short-lived Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, &quot;Jeeves&quot; (1975), for which an original cast album was released.

==Autobiography==
After his death his autobiography, &quot;Blow Up... and Other ExaggerationsThe Autobiography of David Hemmings&quot;, was published in 2004.

==Personal life==
Hemmings was married four times: to Genista Ouvry (1960–1967), actress Gayle Hunnicutt (1968–1975), Prudence de Casembroot (1976–1997), and Lucy Williams (2002 to his death). Hemmings met Hunnicutt while he was in America promoting &quot;Blowup&quot;, by which time his marriage to Ouvry was over. At their outdoor wedding, Henry Mancini conducted an orchestra and the Mamas and the Papas performed next to a swimming pool filled with doves dyed puce. Of his relationship with Hunnicutt, Hemmings remarked, &quot;We were the poor man&#x27;s Taylor and Burton&quot;. Their marriage ended when Hunnicutt discovered Hemmings&#x27;s affairs with actress Samantha Eggar (his co-star in &quot;The Walking Stick&quot; (1970)), and his secretary Prudence de Casembroot.

During his subsequent marriage to de Casembroot, Hemmings continued to have extra-marital relationships with, among others, Tessa Dahl.

Hemmings had six children altogether; he and Ouvry had a daughter, he and Hunnicutt had a son (actor Nolan Hemmings), while he and de Casembroot had three sons and a daughter.

Hemmings was an active supporter of liberal causes, and spoke at a number of meetings on behalf of the UK&#x27;s Liberal Party.
==Death==
Hemmings suddenly died in 2003 at age 62 of a heart attack, in Bucharest, Romania, on the film set of &quot;Blessed&quot; (working title: &quot;Samantha&#x27;s Child&quot;) after he had performed his scenes for the day.

His funeral was held at St Peter&#x27;s Church, in the hamlet of Blackland near Calne, Wiltshire, where he had lived in his final years. He was buried in the graveyard of the church.

<text>American Tabloid is a 1995 novel by James Ellroy that chronicles the events surrounding three rogue American law enforcement officers from November 22, 1958, through November 22, 1963. Each becomes entangled in a web of interconnecting associations between the FBI, the CIA, and the Mafia, which eventually leads to their collective involvement in the John F. Kennedy assassination.

&quot;American Tabloid&quot; was &quot;Time&quot; Best Book (Fiction) for 1995. It is the first novel in Ellroy&#x27;s Underworld USA Trilogy, followed by &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot; and &quot;Blood&#x27;s a Rover&quot;.

== Structure ==
&quot;American Tabloid&quot; is divided into five sections. As do the other two Underworld USA books, it contains exactly one hundred chapters (many less than a page in length), and covers exactly five years. The narration eschews both exposition and lengthy dialog exchanges. All chapters begin with the chapter number, the location (usually the name of a city), and the date. The action of the book is completely sequential.

The book is written in the limited third-person, alternating between the three main characters. &quot;Document inserts&quot; reproducing newspaper clippings, letters, and transcripts of telephone calls are interspersed between chapters. There are flashbacks, but they are restricted to the present-tense memory of the protagonists.

== Plot summary ==
===Part I, Shakedowns, November – December 1958===
The novel centers around the three principal characters: Pete Bondurant, a former Los Angeles County sheriff&#x27;s deputy who presently works for billionaire Howard Hughes and runs small-time shakedowns; Kemper Boyd, an FBI agent who covets wealth and power; and Ward Littell, another FBI agent who is Boyd&#x27;s friend and former partner. Although assigned to monitor communist activities, Littell&#x27;s abiding hatred of organized crime leads him to vie for a spot on the Bureau&#x27;s Top Hoodlum Squad.

The three men plot to entrap John F. Kennedy with a call girl; Boyd and Littell for J. Edgar Hoover, Bondurant for Hughes. The set-up is successful, but the Kennedy family prevents the transcript of the encounter from being printed in Hughes&#x27; &quot;Hush-Hush&quot; tabloid. At Hoover&#x27;s direction, Boyd leaves the FBI and begins working with Hoover&#x27;s personal nemeses—Kennedy and his younger brother Robert—on the U.S. Senate Select Committee investigating mob involvement in labor unions. The Kennedys, with their wealth and privilege, embody everything that Boyd hopes to gain. Littell, who meets the Kennedys through Boyd, is enraptured by Robert, both men sharing a hatred for organized crime.

===Part II, Collusion, January 1959 – January 1961===
Following the Cuban revolution, Bondurant and Boyd both become CIA operatives while Littell investigates Jimmy Hoffa&#x27;s ties to the mob. Boyd also joins the employ of the Kennedy family, working on John&#x27;s presidential campaign. Bondurant and Boyd ultimately collaborate with the CIA, the mob (seeking to retake its now-nationalized casinos in Havana) and far right Cuban refugees plotting to overthrow Fidel Castro&#x27;s regime. Littell becomes increasingly frustrated with Hoover&#x27;s anti-communist mandates and begins investigating the mob on his own. 

Through a series of snitches, Littell confirms that the Teamsters Union&#x27;s pension fund is being used to finance organized crime. Littell tracks the fund&#x27;s supposed &quot;secret&quot; accounting books to the home of mid-level mobster Jules Schiffrin in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, coercing Jack Ruby into searching Schiffrin&#x27;s home. While waiting for Ruby, Littell is severely beaten by Bondurant; Ruby had tipped off Bondurant to Littell&#x27;s operation, and Bondurant feared that Littell would endanger the CIA&#x27;s Cuban plots.

After recuperating, Littell takes leave from the FBI, invades Schiffrin&#x27;s home, and steals the fund&#x27;s books himself. Cracking the books&#x27; code, he realizes that Joseph Kennedy loaned millions of dollars to the fund. Hoover fires Littell, revokes his pension, and blackballs him from every U.S. state&#x27;s bar association. Boyd tries to get Littell a job with now-Attorney General designate Robert Kennedy, who emphatically refuses, also having received a report from Hoover of Littell&#x27;s budding alcoholism and invented mob ties.

===Part III, Pigs, February – November 1961===
Boyd and Bondurant help train the &quot;Blessington Cadre&quot;: Cuban exiles training to overthrow Castro at a CIA camp in Florida, recruited through Hoffa&#x27;s &quot;Tiger Kab&quot; taxi stand in Miami. The mob, through New Orleans boss Carlos Marcello, funds the operation by supplying the Cadre heroin for redistribution. Robert Kennedy has Marcello deported, unaware of (and uninterested in) his involvement in the CIA operation. Bondurant covertly absconds with Marcello when his INS plane lands in Central America.

Littell, hired as Marcello&#x27;s immigration lawyer at Boyd&#x27;s recommendation, meets Bondurant and Marcello at their hideout and hands over the stolen Teamsters books. President Kennedy, unaware of Boyd&#x27;s CIA connection, taps Boydnow also working for the civil rights task force in Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s Justice Departmentto investigate the Blessington operation and advise whether to implement the CIA&#x27;s invasion strategy. After a sham visit, Boyd naturally encourages the president to authorize the mission, promising Kennedy that it will guarantee his re-election.

The Bay of Pigs Invasion is authorized, although Kennedy second-guesses its wisdom and refuses to provide the air support that the Cadre believes necessary. The invasion fails and proves an embarrassment for Kennedy and all involved—including the CIA, the mob, Bondurant, and Boyd. The night of the invasion, Boyd is shot numerous times in a side operation to distribute &quot;hot shots&quot; of heroin that would be linked back to Castro.

===Part IV, Heroin, December 1961 – September 1963===
Through the patronage of Marcello, Littell becomes a full-fledged mob lawyer and is hired by Hoffa. Through their now-mutual hatred of the Kennedys, Littell and Hoover make amends, and Hoover arranges for Hughes to become Littell&#x27;s client. In the wake of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Boyd and Bondurant encourage the mob to authorize an assassination attempt on Castro. When the mob passes on the opportunity, they surmise that the mob is now backing Castro. Enraged, they execute a plan wherein they steal millions of dollars in heroin as it comes to shore from Cuba in the hopes of recouping their losses from the failed invasion.

In collusion with Littell, Bondurant begins running a wiretap hoping to catch President Kennedy having an affair with a woman they have set up. Boyd, however, remains fond of the president and becomes enraged when he discovers the scam. When he confronts Bondurant, he is played sections from the tapes in which Kennedy ridicules Boyd&#x27;s social-climbing and envy. Robert Kennedy, learning of Boyd&#x27;s CIA connection and erratic behavior upon discovering the wiretap, fingers Boyd as the person trying to set up the president; he fires Boyd from the Justice Department, severing his ties with the Kennedys. Upon figuring out that Boyd and Bondurant were behind the theft of their heroin, Littell relays the mob&#x27;s price to atone for the theft: killing President Kennedy.

===Part V, Contract, September – November 1963===
Boyd, Bondurant and Littell plot to assassinate Kennedy during a motorcade in Miami and arrange the logistics to frame right-wing radicals. Without being specific, Littell tips off Hoover about the plot, but due to Hoover&#x27;s non-committal response he surmises that there is a second assassination plot which will take place several days later in Dallas. The three men determine that they were set up and begin to cover their tracks in Miami. Littell confronts Robert Kennedy with evidence of his father&#x27;s collusion with the mob, with the added intent that it will serve as an after-the-fact explanation of why the president would be killed.

After killing several of the Miami conspirators, Bondurant leaves for Dallas while Boyd returns to Mississippi. Littell is waiting for Boyd at his hotel; Littell shoots Boyd, who dies thinking of President Kennedy. Bondurant, his new wife Barb Jahelka, and several mob associates, converge on Dallas on November 22, 1963. The book ends at 12:30 PM, as Kennedy&#x27;s motorcade drives through Dealey Plaza, with Bondurant closing his eyes, awaiting the shots and screams.

== Main characters ==
Pete Bondurant is a French-Canadian, ex-law enforcement, Hollywood insider, organized-crime associate, and bodyguard for Howard Hughes.

He bears superficial resemblances to historical figures Fred Otash, (so-called &quot;private-eye to the stars&quot;) and Robert Maheu, (who worked for both Hughes and Jimmy Hoffa during the time frame depicted in the book).

Bondurant first appears as a secondary character in &quot;White Jazz&quot; with only superficial similarities to his character in &quot;American Tabloid&quot;. The time-frame overlap between the two books leads to some inconsistencies, including the deteriorating mental state of Howard Hughes.

Kemper Boyd is an FBI agent who, in 1958, is recruited by J. Edgar Hoover to infiltrate the Kennedy organization. This assignment leads to CIA contacts, as well as employment to influence the future President Kennedy to take an anti-Castro stance in his Cuban policy. It also puts him in the position to organize the collaboration between Cosa Nostra and the CIA in the Cuban cause. He falls in love with Laura Hughes, the secret daughter of Gloria Swanson and Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., half sister of the Kennedy brothers.

Boyd also bears a resemblance to Robert Maheu, a close friend of the Kennedy brothers and former FBI agent who admitted to involvement in a conspiracy to kill Fidel Castro and has been linked to the JFK assassination.

Ward Littell is an FBI agent clandestinely investigating organized crime activity in defiance of his employer. He is dismissed from the FBI but secures employment as a &quot;Mob&quot; Lawyer and wins his way back into Hoover&#x27;s good graces.

== Film adaptation ==
In 2002, it was reported that Bruce Willis optioned the rights to produce and star in a TV miniseries based on &quot;American Tabloid&quot; and &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot;. Willis&#x27;s option expired before he produced the series.

In 2008, &quot;Daily Variety&quot; reported that HBO, along with Tom Hanks&#x27;s production company, Playtone, were developing &quot;American Tabloid&quot; and &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot; for either a mini-series or ongoing series. Screenwriter Kirk Ellis was drafting a screenplay for the potential series.

<text>Mount Taranaki (), formerly Mount Egmont, is a dormant stratovolcano and legal person in the Taranaki region on the west coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. At , it is the second highest mountain in the North Island, after Mount Ruapehu. It has a secondary cone, Fanthams Peak (), , on its south side.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Taranaki&quot; is from the Māori language. The mountain was named after Rua Taranaki, the first ancestor of the iwi (tribe) called Taranaki, one of several iwi in the region. The Māori word &quot;tara&quot; means mountain peak, and &quot;naki&quot; may come from &quot;ngaki&quot;, meaning &quot;clear of vegetation.&quot; It was also named (&quot;ice mountain&quot;) and (&quot;hill of Naki&quot;) by iwi who lived in the region in &quot;ancient times&quot;.

Captain Cook named it Mount Egmont on 11 January 1770 after John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont, a former First Lord of the Admiralty who had supported the concept of an oceanic search for &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot;. Cook described it as &quot;of a prodigious height and its top cover&#x27;d with everlasting snow,&quot; surrounded by a &quot;flat country ... which afforded a very good aspect, being clothed with wood and &quot;.

When the French explorer Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne saw the mountain on 25 March 1772 he named it . He was unaware of Cook&#x27;s earlier visit.

It appeared as Mount Egmont on maps until 29 May 1986, when the name officially became &quot;Mount Taranaki or Mount Egmont&quot; following a decision by the Minister of Lands, Koro Wētere. The Egmont name still applies to the national park that surrounds the peak and geologists still refer to the peak as the Egmont Volcano.

As part of the Treaty of Waitangi settlement with Ngā Iwi o Taranaki, a group of tribes in the region, the mountain will be officially named &quot;Taranaki Maunga&quot;, and will be the first natural geographic feature with an official name in Māori, rather than English. The settlement was initialled on 31 March 2023, and has been ratified by the iwi of Taranaki.

Some iwi in the region had referred to the mountain as &quot;Taranaki Mounga&quot; rather than &quot;Taranaki Maunga&quot;, per the local Māori dialect.

== Geology ==
Mount Taranaki is situated in the sedimentary Taranaki Basin and is part of the Taranaki Volcanic Lineament which has had a north to south migration over the last 1.75 million years. A Wadati–Benioff zone exists at about depth and the volcano&#x27;s magma has the geochemical features of an arc volcano. Under the volcano itself there is high heat flow with only about crustal thickness although this rapidly normalises for continental crust to east of the volcano and to the west.

=== Volcanic activity ===
Taranaki is geologically young, having commenced activity approximately 135,000 years ago. The most recent volcanic activity was the production of a lava dome in the crater and its collapse down the side of the mountain in the 1850s or 1860s. Between 1755 and 1800, an eruption sent a pyroclastic flow down the mountain&#x27;s northeast flanks, and a moderate ash eruption occurred about 1755, of the size of Ruapehu&#x27;s activity in 1995/1996. The last major eruption occurred around 1655. Recent research has shown that over the last 9,000 years minor eruptions have occurred roughly every 90 years on average, with major eruptions every 500 years. Some of these eruptions may have occurred with very brief warning, of only days or less.

=== Hazards ===
Taranaki is unusual in that it has experienced at least five of its major eruptions by the method of cone collapse. Few volcanoes have undergone more than one cone collapse. The vast volume of material involved in these collapses is reflected in the extensive ring plain surrounding the volcano. There is also evidence of lahars being a common result of eruption. The major collapse cycles have a potential maximum size of collapse of every 30,000 to 35,000 years. Such collapse debris fields have been found up to beyound the coast. Another major edifice collapse is expected to occur within 16,200 years.

Much of the region is at risk from lahars, which have reached the eastern coast. A volcanic event is not necessary for a lahar: even earthquakes combined with heavy rain or snow could dislodge vast quantities of unstable layers resting on steep slopes. Many farmers live in the paths of such possible destructive events.

Although volcanic eruptions are notoriously chaotic in their frequency, some scientists warn that a large eruption is &quot;overdue&quot;. Research from Massey University indicates that significant seismic activity from the local faults is likely again in the next 50 years and such might be permissive to an eruption. What ever in the next 50 years, the probability of at least one eruption is between 33% and 42%. Prevailing winds would probably blow ash east, covering much of the North Island, and disrupting air routes, power transmission lines and local water supplies.

=== Older volcanoes in the area ===
Mount Taranaki is one of four closely associated Quaternary volcanoes in Taranaki province that have erupted from andesite magmas that have not extensively assimilated enriched crust unlike the cone volcanos of the North Island Volcanic Plateau. It sits on the remains of three older volcanic complexes that lie to the northwest. The Indo-Australian Plate is slowly moving relative to the magma source that feeds these volcanoes. This trend is reflected in Fanthams Peak, the newer secondary cone on the southeast side of Taranaki and named after Fanny Fantham who was the first European woman to climb the peak in 1887.

The oldest volcanic remnants consist of a series of lava plugs: Paritutu Rock (156 metres), which forms part of New Plymouth&#x27;s harbour, and the Sugar Loaf Islands close offshore. These have been dated at 1.75 million years.

On the coast, 15 kilometres southwest of New Plymouth is the Kaitake Range (682 metres), last active over 500,000 years ago.

Nearest to Taranaki is the Pouakai Range. Pouakai may have originated around the same time as Kaitake but remained active until about 210,000 years ago. Much of Pouakai&#x27;s large ring plain was obliterated by the Egmont Volcano, the hills near Eltham being the only remnant to the south.

== Māori mythology ==
According to Māori mythology, Taranaki once resided in the middle of the North Island, with all the other New Zealand volcanoes. The beautiful Pihanga was coveted by all the mountains, and a great battle broke out between them. Tongariro eventually won the day, inflicted great wounds on the side of Taranaki, and causing him to flee. Taranaki headed westwards, following Te Toka a Rahotu (the Rock of Rahotu) and forming the deep gorges of the Whanganui River, paused for a while, creating the depression that formed the Ngaere swamp, then heading north. Further progress was blocked by the Pouakai Ranges, and as the sun came up Taranaki became petrified in his current location. When Taranaki conceals himself with rainclouds, he is said to be crying for his lost love, and during spectacular sunsets, he is said to be displaying himself to her. In turn, Tongariro&#x27;s eruptions are said to be a warning to Taranaki not to return.

== History ==

The mountain was tapu in Māori culture and at the time of European settlement not climbed by them.

In 1839 the mountain was climbed by James Heberley, a whaler who reached the summit first and the Swiss trained doctor and naturalist Ernst Dieffenbach. During his initial ascent, he identified the fast-flowing streams as being well suited to water driven mills. Dieffenbach was employed by the New Zealand Company to advise on the potential of land he explored in the North Island in 1839–40.

In 1865 the mountain was confiscated from Māori by the New Zealand Government under the powers of the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, ostensibly as a means of establishing and maintaining peace amid the Second Taranaki War. The legislation was framed with the intention of seizing and dividing up the land of Māori &quot;in rebellion&quot; and providing it as farmland for military settlers.

The mountain was returned to the people of Taranaki in 1978 by means of the Mount Egmont Vesting Act 1978, which vested it to the Taranaki Maori Trust Board. By means of the same Act, it was immediately passed back to the Government as a gift to the nation. The Waitangi Tribunal, in its 1996 report, Kaupapa Tuatahi, observed: &quot;We are unaware of the evidence that the hapū agreed to this arrangement. Many who made submissions to us were adamant that most knew nothing of it.&quot; It cited a submission that suggested the political climate of 1975 was such that the board felt it was necessary to perform a gesture of goodwill designed to create a more favourable environment within which a monetary settlement could be negotiated.

Because of its resemblance to Mount Fuji, Taranaki provided the backdrop for the 2003 film &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;.

In 2017, a record of understanding was signed between Taranaki iwi and the New Zealand government that will see the mountain become a legal personality. It is the third geographic feature in the country to be granted a legal personality, after Te Urewera and Whanganui River.

On 2 December 2019, an agreement between the crown and Ngā Iwi o Taranaki was announced that the mountain was to only be referred to as Taranaki Maunga. The national park will be renamed from Egmont National Park to Te Papakura o Taranaki. The name change has not yet been ratified by the New Zealand Geographic Board.

On 30 January 2025, the New Zealand Parliament passed legislation officially recognising Taranaki as a legal person under the name Taranaki Maunga. Under the legislation, Mount Egmont ceased to be an official name for the mountain. In addition, the New Zealand Crown also apologised to eight Māori iwi for confiscating Mount Taranaki and 1.2 million acres of Māori lands in the Taranaki region.

== National park ==
In 1881, a circular area with a radius of six miles (9.6 km) from the summit was protected as a forest reserve. Areas encompassing the older volcanic remnants of Pouakai and Kaitake were later added to the reserve and in 1900 all this land was designated as Egmont National Park, the second national park in New Zealand. There are parts of the national park where old-growth forests are found. With intensively-farmed dairy pasture right up to the park boundary, the change in vegetation is sharply delineated as a circular shape in satellite images.

== Recreation ==
The Stratford Mountain Club operates the Manganui skifield on the eastern slope. Equipment access to the skifield is by flying fox across the Manganui Gorge.

The Taranaki Alpine Club maintains Tahurangi Lodge on the north slope of the mountain, next to the television tower. The lodge is frequently used as the base for public climbs to the summit held in the summer months. The various climbing and tramping clubs organise these public events and provide informal guides.

Syme Hut is located near Fanthams Peak. It is maintained by the Department of Conservation and is available to trampers on a first come first served basis.

For the average person, Taranaki would be considered a moderate mountain to climb. It takes a person with good fitness level a day to make the up-and-back climb. Weather on the mountain can change rapidly, which has caught inexperienced trampers and climbers unawares. As of 27 June 2017, 84 people have died on the mountain since records began in 1891, many having been caught by a sudden change in the weather. In terms of fatalities this mountain is the second most dangerous mountain in New Zealand after Aoraki / Mount Cook.

== Access ==
There are three roads on the mountain&#x27;s eastern slopes that lead part-way up the mountain with many more around the foot of the mountain that access walking tracks. The highest access road reaches the East Egmont plateau, with a viewing platform and parking facilities for the skifield. It lies at the transition between subalpine scrub and alpine herbfields.

There are park visitor centres at North Egmont and at the waterfall Te Rere o Kapuni on the southeast side.

The eastern side from Stratford leads to the Stratford Mountain House, and the ski field.

There is poor road access on the western side beyond the bush line. However, a road winds for 10 km through native bush over the saddle between Pouakai and Kaitake. Near the top of this road is the renowned Pukeiti Trust rhododendron garden.

== Transmitter ==
The Mount Taranaki transmitter is the main television and FM radio transmitter for the Taranaki region. It is located on the north-eastern slope of the mountain adjacent to Tahurangi Lodge. The first transmitter at the site was commissioned by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC) in 1966 to relay Wellington&#x27;s WNTV1 channel (now part of TVNZ 1).

<doc id="388056" wikidata="Q726254" url="?curid=388056" title="The Wonderful Adventures of Nils">
<text>The Wonderful Adventures of Nils (, literally &quot;Nils Holgersson&#x27;s wonderful journey across Sweden&quot;) is a work of fiction by the Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf, the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. It was originally published in two books, 1906 and 1907, and was first published in English as &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Nils&quot; (1907) and &quot;The Further Adventures of Nils&quot; (1911). The two parts are later usually published together, in English as &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Nils&quot;, but that name may also refer to the first part alone.

Like many leading Swedish intellectuals of her time, Selma Lagerlöf was an advocate of Swedish spelling reform. When first published, this book was also one of the first to adopt the new spelling mandated by a government resolution on April 7, 1906 (see Svenska Akademiens Ordlista).

== Origin ==

The background for publication was a commission from the National Teachers Association in 1902 to write a geography reader for the public schools. &quot;She devoted three years to Nature study and to familiarizing herself with animal and bird life. She has sought out hitherto unpublished folklore and legends of the different provinces. These she has ingeniously woven into her story.&quot; (From translator Velma Swanston Howard&#x27;s introduction.)

==Plot introduction==

The book is about a young lad, Nils Holgersson, whose &quot;chief delight was to eat and sleep, and after that he liked best to make mischief&quot;. He takes great delight in hurting the animals in his family farm. Nils captures a &quot;tomte&quot; in a net while his family are at church and have left him home to memorize chapters from the Bible. The tomte proposes to Nils that if Nils frees him, the tomte will give him a huge gold coin. Nils rejects the offer and the tomte turns Nils into a tomte, which leaves him shrunken and able to talk with animals, who are thrilled to see the boy reduced to their size and are angry and hungry for revenge. While this is happening, wild geese are flying over the farm on one of their migrations, and Martin, the farm&#x27;s white goose attempts to join the wild ones. In an attempt to salvage something before his family returns, Nils holds on to Martin&#x27;s neck as he successfully takes off and joins the wild birds.

The wild geese, who are not pleased at all to be joined by a boy and a domestic goose, eventually take them on an adventurous trip across all the historical provinces of Sweden observing in passing their natural characteristics and economic resources. At the same time the characters and situations he encounters make him a man: the domestic goose needs to prove his ability to fly like the experienced wild geese, and Nils needs to prove to the geese that he would be a useful companion, despite their initial misgivings. During the trip, Nils learns that if he proves he has changed for the better, the tomte might be disposed to change him back to his normal size.

The book also includes various subplots, concerning people and animals whose lives are touched in one way or another by Nils and the wild geese. For example, one chapter centers on a provincial man who feels lonely and alienated in the capital Stockholm, is befriended by a nice old gentleman who tells him (and the reader) about the city&#x27;s history - and only later finds that it was none other than the King of Sweden, walking incognito in the park.

The book was criticized for the fact that the goose and boy don&#x27;t make any stop in the province Halland. In chapter 53 they fly over Halland on the way back to Scania, but they aren&#x27;t impressed by the sight and they don&#x27;t stop. However, such a chapter has been added to some translations of the book. In depictions Nils is usually wearing a red cap, although this is erroneous as he is described in the original Swedish edition as wearing a white cap.

==Chapters and itinerary==
This section follows the English-language translation by Velma Swanston Howard, originally published in 1907 and 1911 as &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Nils&quot; and &quot;Further Adventures of Nils&quot;. The Howard text is that of many later publications that contain the original illustrations, new illustrations, or none at all.

===The Wonderful Adventures of Nils===
Howard&#x27;s first volume contains 21 chapters. Swedish-language chapter titles listed here are identical to those of the 21 chapters in the original volume one (1906).

===Further Adventures of Nils===

Howard&#x27;s second volume contains 22 chapters numbered 1 to 22, where the original volume two (1907) contains 34 chapters numbered 22 to 55. Swedish-language chapter titles listed here are identical to those of 22 among the 34 original chapters. Chapter titles 6 to 18 match original chapter titles 36 to 48.

Howard cut some chapters entirely and abridged others. Some provinces are not featured in the Howard translation, including Dalarna, which is visited in four original chapters (29 to 32).

==Film adaptations==

===1955 Soviet animation===

A Soviet traditionally animated feature film called &quot;The Enchanted Boy&quot; (, &quot;Zakoldovannyy Malchik&quot;) was released in 1955. It was directed by Vladimir Polkovnikov and Aleksandra Snezhko-Blotskaya and produced at the Soyuzmultfilm studio in Moscow.

===1962 Swedish live action===
&quot;Adventures of Nils Holgersson&quot; (&quot;Nils Holgerssons underbara resa&quot;) was released in 1962. It was shot primarily from helicopters, simplifying and downplaying the drama of the plot. It was directed by Kenne Fant.

===1980 Japanese animation===

An anime adaptation (ニルスのふしぎな旅 &quot;Nirusu no Fushigi na Tabi&quot;) consisting of fifty-two 25-minute episodes was broadcast on NHK from January 8, 1980—March 17, 1981. The anime was also broadcast:
* Albania
* in the Arab World (as &quot;مغامرات نيلز&quot; &quot;Nils&#x27; Adventures&quot;)
* Belgium 
* Canada (in French)
* (Mainland) China
* Czech Republic (as &quot;Nils Holgersson&quot;)
* Finland (as &quot;Peukaloisen retket&quot;, not dubbed in Finnish but simply narrated over the German dub, also released in DVD)
* France
* Germany
* Greece (as &quot;Το θαυμαστό ταξίδι του Νίλς Χόλγκερσον&quot; - &quot;The wondrous journey of Nils Holgersson&quot;)
* Hong Kong (dubbed into Cantonese)
* Hungary (as &quot;Nils Holgersson csodálatos utazása a vadludakkal&quot; - &quot;The Wonderful Journey of Nils Holgersson with the Wild Geese&quot;)
* Iceland (as &quot;Nilli Hólmgeirsson&quot;)
* Iran
* Israel (as &quot;נילס הולגרסון&quot;)
* Italy
* The Netherlands
* Poland (as &quot;Nils and the wild geese&quot;)
* Portugal
* Romania
* Slovenia (as &quot;Nils Holgerson&quot; with one s)
* South Africa (Translated to Afrikaans as &quot;Nils Holgerson&quot;)
* Spain
* Sweden
* Turkey (as &quot;Uçan Kaz&quot; (&quot;The Flying Goose&quot;))

In some countries it was cut to allow for commercials. The anime was the very first production by Studio Pierrot (Mamoru Oshii was a director on the series). The anime was mostly fairly true to the original, apart from the appearance of Nils&#x27; pet hamster, and the greater role allowed to the fox Smirre.

In Germany, the animated series episodes were also combined into one full feature animated movie (~ 1h 22min in length) in 1981; the same release has also been dubbed and released in Estonia on DVD &amp; VHS and in Greece on DVD. In Germany, the anime was also adapted into a comic book series, with the drawings made by the Spanish Studio Interpubli, and the German Atelier Roche.

===2011 Swedish/German two-parter===

German TV broadcaster ARD premiered a live-action two-part adaptation starring Justus Kammerer as Nils and directed by Dirk Regel on Christmas 2011. Its total running time is 230 minutes. This version uses a mix of real animals, puppets, and CGI for the geese and other animals.

=== 2017 French Studio 100 3D CGI Adaptation ===
In 2017, a 3D CGI-based TV Series adaptation was released by French Studio 100 Animation. The release consists of 52 episodes, 13 minutes each.

==Israeli version==

In the 1960s the Israeli children&#x27;s weekly &quot;Etz&#x27;beoni&quot; (אצבעוני) ran a long lasting Hebrew comic strip version, loosely based on the Swedish original, where the protagonist&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Gil&quot; (גיל) and the location was transferred to the Israeli countryside.

==Swedish culture==
&quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Nils&quot; is so well known in Swedish
culture that a picture of Nils Holgersson, on the back of a goose flying over the plains of Scania, was printed on the reverse side of the Swedish 20 krona banknote until new bills came in use in 2015.

Nils is also depicted in the logo of the digital map company Tele Atlas.

The sights Nils sees as he and his goose roam the provinces of Sweden are depicted in a series of Christmas plates produced by Rörstrand Pottery. The series began in 1970 and continued until 1999. The plates illustrate the topography, architecture, industry, and wildlife of Sweden.

==Influence on later fantasy==

Lev Grossman&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Magicians&quot; includes numerous allusions to earlier works such as The &quot;Narnia&quot; Series and the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books. The influence of &quot;Nils Holgersson&quot; is evident in a key episode where a class of students nearing graduation from a School of Magic are set a major test: to be transformed into wild geese and undertake an epic flight, all the way from Upper New York State to Antarctica.

<text>North Hwanghae Province (Hwanghaebuk-to; , lit. &quot;north Yellow Sea province&quot;) is a province of North Korea. The province was formed in 1954 when the former Hwanghae Province was split into North and South Hwanghae. The provincial capital is Sariwon. The province is bordered by Pyongyang and South Pyongan to the north, Kangwon to the east, Kaesong Industrial Region and South Korea&#x27;s Gyeonggi Province to the south, and South Hwanghae southwest. In 2003, Kaesong Directly Governed City (&quot;Kaesong Chikhalsi&quot;) became part of North Hwanghae as Kaepung County. Later on in 2019, it was promoted as Special City (&quot;Kaesong T&#x27;ŭkpyŏlsi&quot;). Thus, it was separated from North Hwanghae.

==Administrative divisions==
North Hwanghae is divided into 2 cities (&quot;si&quot;) and 18 counties (&quot;kun&quot;). Three of these counties (Chunghwa, Kangnam, and Sangwon) were added to the province in 2010 after being split from Pyongyang. However, Kangnam was returned to Pyongyang in 2011.

===Cities===
* Sariwon (capital) &lt;br&gt; 사리원시/
* Songrim &lt;br&gt; 송림시/

===Counties===
==Transportation==
North Hwanghae is connected to the rest of the country by way of the Pyongbu Railway Line (known in South Korea as the Kyongui Line), which, in theory, runs from Pyongyang to Pusan; however, in reality, the line is cut short by the Korean Demilitarized Zone. It is also served by several large highways, most notably the Pyongyang-Kaesong Motorway.

==Education==
There are several higher-level educational institutions in North Hwanghae, all government-run. These include the Kye Ung Sang Sariwon University of Agriculture, the Sariwon University of Geology, and the Sariwon Teachers University.

==Culture==
===Historic landmarks===
North Hwanghae has many historical relics as the site of the Koryo-dynasty capital at Kaesong, a depository for many famous historic relics. The province is also home to the tombs of many of the Koryo monarchs, the most famous being the tombs of kings Taejo and Kongmin, though others are spread throughout Kaesong and Kaepung county. Kaesong also houses the Koguryo-era Taehungsan Fortress, built to protect the kingdom&#x27;s capital at Pyongyang and enclosing the famous Kwanum Temple. Nearby to Sariwin is the famous Jongbangsan Fortress, another Koguryo satellite for the defense of Pyongyang. This fortress encompasses the 9th-century Songbulsa Buddhist temple, one of the oldest and most picturesque in the country.

<text>Frederick Haynes Newell (March 5, 1862 – July 5, 1932), served as the first Director of the United States Reclamation Service and was born in Bradford, Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1885 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and after field experience in Colorado and other states was appointed on October 2, 1888, as Assistant Hydraulic Engineer of the United States Geological Survey, being the first aide designated under Major John Wesley Powell to investigate the extent to which the arid regions of the United States might be reclaimed by irrigation. He was subsequently appointed Chief of the Hydrographic Branch.

At the same time, he actively assisted Representative Francis G. Newlands (later Senator) of Nevada, George H. Maxwell of California, President of the National Irrigation Association, and others in the preparation and public presentation of various Congressional bills, one of which by the personal efforts of President Theodore Roosevelt became the Reclamation Act when signed by the latter on June 17, 1902. Immediately after that date Mr. Newell was appointed Chief Engineer under Charles D. Walcott, then Director of the U. S. Geological Survey. In 1907 Roosevelt appointed him as a member of the Inland Waterways Commission.

==Early life==
Newell was born on March 5, 1862, in Bradford, Pennsylvania, a small lumber and mining town to father, Augustus William Newell, and mother, Anna M. Haynes. His father was an early industrialist and real estate mogul in Bradford. Newell&#x27;s mother and Newell&#x27;s sibling died in child birth a year after Newell was born. Newell would spend his childhood and teenage years with extended relatives, living with his uncle in Newton, Connecticut prior to attending MIT.

==Early career==
After receiving his BA in Mining Engineering, Newell returned to Bradford to work for his father. Frederick described his father as &quot;always sanguine, full of entrancing schemes...He was surveyor, engineer and general all around man . . . . He bought and sold coal and timber lands and went into various ventures, characteristic of the time and place. Newell recalled in his unpublished memoirs &quot;The people [in Bradford] were what might be called typical mountaineers and laborers in the lumber camps, rough, illiterate and with many queer old country habits and superstitions.&quot; Afterwards, he joined the Ohio Geological Survey in order to study oil–bearing rocks, but in 1888 Newell met John Wesley Powell, the head of the United States Geological Survey in Boston.

== U.S. Geological Survey ==
In 1888 Powell created the Irrigation Survey. One of the functions of the Irrigation Survey was to undertake a systematic program of measuring streamflow in rivers across the western United States in order to determine how much land could be irrigated in each river basin. Newell was hired to develop the methods to be used to accomplish this and to train engineers to carry it out. This was done at a camp on the banks of the Rio Grande River at Embudo, New Mexico in the winter of 1888–9. This is the site of the Embudo Stream Gauging Station. It is now regarded as the birthplace of systematic streamgaging in the United States. Starting in the Spring of 1889 the hydrographers trained at Embudo fanned out to establish streamgages all across the Western US. Newell lead these efforts and created the convention of using the spelling &quot;gage&quot; (still in use in the Geological Survey as of 2022) rather than &quot;gauge&quot;. &quot;The pioneer work he performed in those early years in the Geological Survey has led to his having often been referred to as the &#x27;father of systematic stream gaging&#x27; in [the US]&quot;

==Reclamation Service==
During the next few years the organization of the Reclamation Service was completed and plans outlined for extensive work in each of the western states, work being initiated in most of these. In 1907, when Mr. Walcott left the Geological Survey to become Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Reclamation Service was organized as a separate bureau of the Department of the Interior with Mr. Newell as Director and Arthur P. Davis as Chief Engineer. Construction was rapidly pushed until twenty-six projects, including reservoirs, canals and related works were completed in whole or part, notably the Roosevelt, Shoshone, Arrowrock, Gunnison Tunnels and others, involving the investment of over $100,000,000, in 100 dams, of which ten form reservoirs of national importance also of tunnels, of irrigating canals and ditches with regulating works, bridges, steam and hydro-electric generators, transmission lines, pumps and devices connected with supplying water to 20,000 farms. Special efforts were made to attain the highest practicable economy and efficiency in the execution of the work and to meet the need and desires of the settlers under them.

==Offices and awards==
Frederick Haynes Newell was Secretary of the National Geographic Society from 1892 to 1893 and from 1897 to 1899, Secretary of the American Forestry Association after 1895, President of the American Association of Engineers in 1919. He was awarded the Cullum Geographical Medal by the American Geographical Society in 1918.

==Personal life==
In 1877, his father, Augustus W. Newell, married his second wife Miss Phoebe Lewis. They begot Lewis, Henry Foster, and Augustus William Jr.

Frederick Haynes Newell married Effie Josephine Mackintosh April 3, 1890 in Milton, Massachusetts. Her father was John Sherman Mackintosh, the grandson of John Sherman and the great-grandson of American founding father Roger Sherman.

Newell died at his offices in Washington, D.C., on July 5, 1932. He was buried at Needham Cemetery in Massachusetts.

== Legacy ==
In 2003 the USGS and Bureau of Reclamation jointly opened an office building in Boise, Idaho that was named for Newell, recognizing the important role he played in the development of these two bureaus within the Department of the Interior. Public Law 108-462 designated the building as the &quot;F.H. Newell Building&quot;. It was signed into law on December 21, 2004. The building is located at 230 Collins Road, Boise, Idaho. The building features a number of energy efficiency features.

<doc id="388065" wikidata="Q1010548" url="?curid=388065" title="United States Bureau of Reclamation">
<text>The Bureau of Reclamation, formerly the United States Reclamation Service, is a federal agency under the U.S. Department of the Interior, which oversees water resource management, specifically as it applies to the oversight and operation of the diversion, delivery, and storage projects that it has built throughout the western United States for irrigation, water supply, and attendant hydroelectric power generation. It is currently the U.S.&#x27;s largest wholesaler of water, bringing water to more than 31 million people, and providing one in five Western farmers with irrigation water for 10 million acres of farmland, which produce 60% of the nation&#x27;s vegetables and 25% of its fruits and nuts. The Bureau is also the second largest producer of hydroelectric power in the western U.S.

On June 17, 1902, in accordance with the Reclamation Act, Secretary of the Interior Ethan Allen Hitchcock established the U.S. Reclamation Service within the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The new Reclamation Service studied potential water development projects in each western state with federal lands. Revenue from sale of federal lands was the initial source of the program&#x27;s funding. Because Texas had no federal lands, it did not become a Reclamation state until 1906, when Congress passed a law including it in the provisions of the Reclamation Act.

== History ==
From 1902 to 1907, Reclamation began about 30 projects in Western states. Then, in 1907, the Secretary of the Interior separated the Reclamation Service from the USGS and created an independent bureau within the Department of the Interior. Frederick Haynes Newell was appointed the first director of the new bureau. Beginning with the third person to take over the direction of Reclamation in 1923, David W. Davis, the title was changed from Director to Commissioner.

In the early years, many projects encountered problems: lands or soils included in projects were unsuitable for irrigation; land speculation sometimes resulted in poor settlement patterns; proposed repayment schedules could not be met by irrigators who had high land-preparation and facilities-construction costs; settlers were inexperienced in irrigation farming; waterlogging of irrigable lands required expensive drainage projects; and projects were built in areas which could only grow low-value crops. In 1923 the agency was renamed the &quot;Bureau of Reclamation&quot;. In 1924, however, in the face of increasing settler unrest and financial woes, the &quot;Fact Finder&#x27;s Report&quot; spotlighted major problematic issues; the Fact Finders Act in late 1924 sought to resolve some of these problems.

In 1928 Congress authorized the Boulder Canyon (Hoover Dam) Project, and large appropriations began, for the first time, to flow to Reclamation from the general funds of the United States. The authorization came only after a hard-fought debate about the pros and cons of public power versus private power.

The heyday of Reclamation construction of water facilities occurred during the Depression and the 35 years after World War II. From 1941 to 1947, Civilian Public Service labor was used to carry on projects otherwise interrupted by the war effort. The last major authorization for construction projects occurred in the late 1960s, while a parallel evolution and development of the American environmental movement began to result in strong opposition to water development projects. Even the 1976 failure of Teton Dam as it filled for the first time did not diminish Reclamation&#x27;s strong international reputation in water development circles. However, this first and only failure of a major Reclamation Bureau dam led to subsequent strengthening of its dam-safety program to avoid similar problems. Even so, the failure of Teton Dam, the environmental movement, and the announcement of President Carter&#x27;s &quot;hit list&quot; on water projects profoundly affected the direction of Reclamation&#x27;s programs and activities.

Reclamation operates about 180 projects in the 17 western states. The total Reclamation investment for completed project facilities in September 1992 was about $11 billion. Reclamation projects provide agricultural, household, and industrial water to about one‑third of the population of the American West. About 5% of the land area of the West is irrigated, and Reclamation provides water to about one-fifth of that area, some 9,120,000 acres (37,000 km2) in 1992. Reclamation is a major American generator of electricity. , Reclamation had 58 power plants on‑line and generated 125,000 GJ of electricity.

From 1988 to 1994, Reclamation underwent major reorganization as construction on projects authorized in the 1960s and earlier drew to an end. Reclamation wrote that &quot;The arid West essentially has been reclaimed. The major rivers have been harnessed and facilities are in place or are being completed to meet the most pressing current water demands and those of the immediate future&quot;. Emphasis in Reclamation programs shifted from construction to operation and maintenance of existing facilities. Reclamation&#x27;s redefined official mission is to &quot;manage, develop, and protect water and related resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner in the interest of the American public&quot;. In redirecting its programs and responsibilities, Reclamation substantially reduced its staff levels and budgets but remains a significant federal agency in the West.
On October 1, 2017, the Hoover Dam Police Department was closed and the National Park Service took over law enforcement duties for the Hoover Dam. The Hoover Dam Police Department existed for more than 80 years.

==Leadership==
Reclamation commissioners that have had a strong impact and molding of the Bureau have included Elwood Mead, Michael W. Straus, and Floyd Dominy, with the latter two being public-power boosters who ran the Bureau during its heyday. Mead guided the bureau during the development, planning, and construction of the Hoover Dam, the United States&#x27; first multiple-purpose dam.

John W. Keys, the 16th Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation who served from July 2001 to April 2006, was killed two years after his retirement on May 30, 2008, when the airplane he was piloting crashed in Canyonlands National Park, Utah.

On June 26, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Brenda Burman to serve as the Commissioner of the United States Bureau of Reclamation. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 16, 2017. Burman is the first woman to ever lead the Bureau of Reclamation. David Murillo was serving as the acting commissioner of the bureau. Burman resigned on January 20 after the inauguration of the Biden Administration.

The current Commissioner is Camille Calimlim Touton, the first Filipino American to head the agency. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 4, 2021.

<text>Lee Earle &quot;James&quot; Ellroy (born March 4, 1948) is an American crime fiction writer and essayist. Ellroy has become known for a telegrammatic prose style in his most recent work, wherein he frequently omits connecting words and uses only short, staccato sentences, and in particular for the novels &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; (1987) and &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1990).

==Life==
===Early life===
Lee Earle &quot;James&quot; Ellroy was born in Los Angeles. His mother, Geneva Odelia (née Hilliker), was a nurse. His father, Armand, was an accountant and a onetime business manager of Rita Hayworth. His parents divorced in 1954, after which Ellroy and his mother moved to El Monte, California.

At the age of seven, Ellroy saw his mother naked and began to sexually fantasize about her. He struggled in youth with this obsession, as he held a psycho-sexual relationship with her, and tried to catch glimpses of her nude. Ellroy stated that &quot;I lived for naked glimpses. I hated her and lusted for her...&quot;

On June 22, 1958, when Ellroy was 10 years old, his mother was raped and murdered. Ellroy later described his mother as &quot;sharp-tongued [and] bad-tempered&quot;, unable to keep a steady job, alcoholic, and sexually promiscuous. His first reaction upon hearing of her death was relief: he could now live with his father, whom he preferred. His father was more permissive and allowed Ellroy to do as he pleased, namely be &quot;left alone to read, to go out and peep through windows, prowl around and sniff the air.&quot; The police never found his mother&#x27;s killer, and the case still remains unsolved. The murder, along with reading &quot;The Badge&quot; by Jack Webb (a book comprising sensational cases from the files of the Los Angeles Police Department, a birthday gift from his father), were important events of Ellroy&#x27;s youth.

Ellroy&#x27;s inability to come to terms with the emotions surrounding his mother&#x27;s murder led him to transfer them onto another murder victim, Elizabeth Short. Nicknamed the &quot;Black Dahlia,&quot; Short was a young woman murdered in 1947, her body cut in half and discarded in Los Angeles, in a notorious and unsolved crime. Throughout his youth, Ellroy used Short as a surrogate for his conflicting emotions and desires. His confusion and trauma led to a period of intense clinical depression, from which he recovered only gradually.

===Education===
In 1962, Ellroy began to attend Fairfax High School, a predominantly Jewish high school. While in high school, he began to engage in a variety of outrageous acts, many anti-Semitic in nature. He joined the American Nazi Party, purchased Nazi paraphernalia, sang the Horst-Wessel-Lied at school, mailed Nazi pamphlets to girls he liked, openly criticized John F. Kennedy, and ironically advocated for the reinstatement of slavery. His &quot;Crazy Man Act&quot;, as Ellroy describes it, was a plea for attention and got him beat up and eventually expelled from Fairfax High School in 11th grade, after ranting about Nazism in his English class.

Ellroy&#x27;s father died soon after this, with his father&#x27;s last words to him being, &quot;Try to pick up every waitress who serves you.&quot;

===Early career===
After being expelled from high school, Ellroy then joined the U.S. Army for a short period of time. On enlisting, Ellroy soon decided he did not belong there and convinced an army psychiatrist he was unfit for combat. He was discharged after three months.

Ellroy credits the public libraries of Los Angeles County as the basis of his writing. He shelved books at the public library. In a speech at the Library of Congress in 2019 he declared: &quot;I am a product of the L.A. County Public Library System.&quot; During his teens and 20s, he drank heavily and abused Benzedrex inhalers. He was engaged in minor crimes (especially shoplifting, house-breaking, and burglary) and was often homeless. After serving some time in jail and suffering from pneumonia, during which he developed an abscess on his lung &quot;the size of a large man&#x27;s fist,&quot; Ellroy stopped drinking and began working as a golf caddie while pursuing writing. He later said, &quot;Caddying was good tax-free cash and allowed me to get home by 2 p.m. and write books... I caddied right up to the sale of my fifth book.&quot; Ellroy has also summed up his life by saying: &quot;Boy&#x27;s mother murdered. Boy&#x27;s life shattered. Boy grows up homeless alcoholic jailbird. Jailbird cleans up and writes his way to salvation. Jailbird becomes the Mad Dog of American Crime Fiction.&quot;

===Personal life===
On October 4, 1991, Ellroy married writer and critic Helen Knode. The couple moved from California to Kansas City in 1995. In 2006, after their divorce, Ellroy returned to Los Angeles. The two later reconciled and moved to Denver, although Ellroy has stated that they live in separate apartments in the same building. He frequently tells interviewers that the issue for him is not monogamy, but cohabitation.

Ellroy joined Alcoholics Anonymous in the 1970s.

==Literary career==
In 1981, Ellroy published his first novel, &quot;Brown&#x27;s Requiem&quot;, a detective story drawing on his experiences as a caddie. He then published &quot;Clandestine&quot; and &quot;Silent Terror&quot; (which was later published under the title &quot;Killer on the Road&quot;). Ellroy followed these three novels with the Lloyd Hopkins Trilogy. The novels are centered on Hopkins, a brilliant but disturbed LAPD robbery-homicide detective, and are set mainly in the 1980s.

He is a self-described recluse who possesses very few technological amenities, including television, and claims never to read contemporary books by other authors, aside from Joseph Wambaugh&#x27;s &quot;The Onion Field&quot;, out of concern that they might influence his own. However, this does not mean that Ellroy does not read at all, as he claims in &quot;My Dark Places&quot; to have read at least two books a week growing up, eventually shoplifting more to satisfy his love of reading. He then goes on to say that he read works by Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.

===Writing style===
Hallmarks of his work include dense plotting and a relentlessly pessimistic—albeit moral—worldview. His work has earned Ellroy the nickname &quot;Demon dog of American crime fiction.&quot;

Ellroy writes longhand on legal pads rather than on a computer. He prepares elaborate outlines for his books, most of which are several hundred pages long.

Dialogue and narration in Ellroy novels often consists of a &quot;heightened pastiche of jazz slang, cop patois, creative profanity and drug vernacular&quot; with a particular use of period-appropriate slang. He often employs a sort of telegraphese (stripped-down, staccato-like sentence structures), a style that reaches its apex in &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot;. Ellroy describes it as a &quot;direct, shorter-rather-than-longer sentence style that&#x27;s declarative and ugly and right there, punching you in the nards.&quot; This signature style is not the result of a conscious experimentation but of chance and came about when he was asked by his editor to shorten his novel &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; by more than one hundred pages. Rather than removing any subplots, Ellroy abbreviated the novel by cutting every unnecessary word from every sentence, creating a unique style of prose. While each sentence on its own is simple, the cumulative effect is a dense, baroque style.

===The L.A. Quartet===


While his early novels earned him a cult following and notice among crime fiction buffs, Ellroy earned much greater success and critical acclaim with the L.A. Quartet&quot;—The Black Dahlia&quot;, &quot;The Big Nowhere&quot;, &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, and &quot;White Jazz&quot;. The four novels represent Ellroy&#x27;s change of style from the tradition of classic modernist noir fiction of his earlier novels to what has been classified as postmodern historiographic metafiction. &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, for example, fused the real-life murder of Elizabeth Short with a fictional story of two police officers investigating the crime.

===Underworld USA Trilogy===

In 1995, Ellroy published &quot;American Tabloid&quot;, the first novel in a series informally dubbed the &quot;Underworld USA Trilogy&quot; that Ellroy describes as a &quot;secret history&quot; of the mid-to-late 20th century. &quot;Tabloid&quot; was named &quot;TIME&quot;″s fiction book of the year for 1995. Its follow-up, &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot;, became a bestseller. The final novel, &quot;Blood&#x27;s a Rover&quot;, was released on September 22, 2009.

===&quot;My Dark Places&quot;===
After publishing &quot;American Tabloid&quot;, Ellroy began a memoir, &quot;My Dark Places&quot;, based on his memories of his mother&#x27;s murder, the unconventional relationship he had with her, and his investigation of the crime. In the memoir, Ellroy mentions that his mother&#x27;s murder received little news coverage because the media were still fixated on the stabbing death of mobster Johnny Stompanato, who was dating actress Lana Turner. Frank C. Girardot, a reporter for &quot;The San Gabriel Valley Tribune&quot;, accessed files on Geneva Hilliker Ellroy&#x27;s murder from detectives with Los Angeles Police Department. Based on the cold case file, Ellroy and investigator Bill Stoner worked the case but gave up after 15 months, believing any suspects to be dead. After the final pages of &quot;My Dark Places&quot;, a contact page is provided, stating: &quot;The investigation continues. Information on the case can be forwarded to Detective Stoner either through the toll-free number, 1-800-717-6517, or his e-mail address, detstoner@earthlink.net.&quot; In 2008, The Library of America selected the essay &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Killer&quot; from &quot;My Dark Places&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.

===Other===
Ellroy is currently writing a &quot;Second L.A. Quartet&quot; taking place during the Second World War, with some characters from the first &quot;L.A. Quartet&quot; and the &quot;Underworld USA Trilogy&quot; reappearing in younger depictions. The first book, &quot;Perfidia&quot;, was released on September 9, 2014. The second book is titled &quot;This Storm&quot; which had a release date of May 14, 2019. It was released May 30, 2019, in the United Kingdom, and June 4, 2019, in the United States.

A Waterstones exclusive limited edition of &quot;Perfidia&quot; was published two days after its initial release and included an essay by Ellroy titled &quot;Ellroy&#x27;s History—Then and Now.&quot;. Ellroy dedicated &quot;Perfidia&quot; &quot;To Lisa Stafford.&quot; The epigraph is &quot;Envy thou not the oppressor, And choose none of his ways&quot; from Proverbs 3:31.

In collaboration with the Los Angeles Police Museum and Glynn Martin, the museum&#x27;s executive director, Ellroy released &quot;LAPD &#x27;53&quot; on May 19, 2015. Photography from the museum&#x27;s archives are presented alongside Ellroy&#x27;s writings about crime and law enforcement during that era.

In the fall of 2017, Ellroy investigated the murder of Sal Mineo. Reminiscent of how he investigated his mother&#x27;s unsolved murder, Ellroy worked with Glynn Martin, an ex-LAPD officer, the LAPD Museum&#x27;s current executive director, and co-author of &quot;LAPD &#x27;53&quot;. Ellroy wrote about this investigation for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in digital form on December 21, 2018, and it also appeared in published form in the December 18, 2018, issue of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; magazine.

Early in January 2019, Ellroy posted news on jamesellroy.net, writing, &quot;I’m digitally illiterate, so you’ve got to gas on the fact that I’m breaking &quot;baaaaaaaaad&quot; from tradition, in order to post this announcement.&quot; Ellroy posted that he had been inducted into the Everyman&#x27;s Library series. Three Everyman&#x27;s Library editions have been reprinted: &quot;The L.A. Quartet&quot;, &quot;The Underworld U.S.A. Trilogy, Volume I&quot; and &quot;The Underworld U.S.A. Trilogy, Volume II&quot;. The release dates for these editions, as well as &quot;This Storm: A Novel&quot;, was June 4, 2019. Ellroy added, &quot;Stay stirringly tuned to this website for further updates&quot; and simply signed the finished post &quot;Ellroy,&quot; inserting a dog&#x27;s pawprint below it.

In 2022 Ellroy, a long-time fan of Chester Himes, wrote the introduction to Himes&#x27;s classic, &#x27;A Rage in Harlem&#x27;. In his hard-bitten style, Ellroy raves that &quot;&#x27;A Rage in Harlem&#x27; features a mind-mauling array of chump-change hustles, lurid larcenies, and malicious mischief.&quot;The novel was originally published in France in 1958 where it won France&#x27;s &#x27;Grand Prix de Littérature Policière&#x27;, and was most recently re-published by Vintage Books.

In 2023, at the &quot;LA Times&quot; Festival of Books, Ellroy revealed, in light of his latest book &quot;The Enchanters&quot; and his editors&#x27; response to it, that he had abandoned his previous plans to write a &#x27;Second L.A. Quartet&#x27; and would instead turn it into a quintet, with &quot;The Enchanters&quot; being the third of five books in the series. The later books in the series will be set in the 1960s and will tie back in to the World War II setting, Japanese internment and the immediate post-war setting initially established in &quot;Perfidia&quot; and &quot;This Storm&quot;.

==Public life and views==
In media appearances, Ellroy has adopted an outsized, stylized public persona of hard-boiled nihilism and self-reflexive subversiveness. He frequently begins public appearances with a monologue such as:

Good evening peepers, prowlers, pederasts, panty-sniffers, punks and pimps. I&#x27;m James Ellroy, the demon dog with the hog-log, the foul owl with the death growl, the white knight of the far right, and the slick trick with the donkey dick. I&#x27;m the author of 16 books, masterpieces all; they precede all my future masterpieces. These books will leave you reamed, steamed and drycleaned, tie-dyed, swept to the side, true-blued, tattooed and bah fongooed. These are books for the whole fuckin&#x27; family, if the name of your family is Manson.

Another aspect of his public persona involves an almost comically grand assessment of his work and his place in literature. For example, he told the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;I am a master of fiction. I am also the greatest crime novelist who ever lived. I am to the crime novel in specific what Tolstoy is to the Russian novel and what Beethoven is to music.&quot;

Structurally, several of Ellroy&#x27;s books, such as &quot;The Big Nowhere&quot;, &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, &quot;American Tabloid&quot;, and &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot;, have three disparate points of view through different characters, with chapters alternating between them. Starting with &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, Ellroy&#x27;s novels have mostly been historical dramas about the relationship between corruption and law enforcement.

A predominant theme of Ellroy&#x27;s work is the myth of &quot;closure&quot;. &quot;Closure is bullshit&quot;, Ellroy often remarks, &quot;and I would love to find the man who invented closure and shove a giant closure plaque up his ass.&quot; In his works characters often die or vanish quickly before otherwise traditional closure points in order to capitalize this idea.

Ellroy has claimed that he is done writing noir crime novels. &quot;I write big political books now,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to write about LA exclusively for the rest of my career. I don&#x27;t know where and when.&quot;

On April 29, 2015, Ellroy and Lois Duncan were the Grandmasters at the 2015 Edgar Awards.

===Politics===
Ellroy has frequently espoused conservative political views. In 2019, Ellroy described himself as anti-totalitarian, conservative, and a Tory, adding &quot;Underneath my profane exterior, I&#x27;m very concerned with decorum, with probity, with morality, and I have a painfully developed conscience. I despise unconscionable acts, whoever is perpetrating them.&quot;

In a 2009 interview, Ellroy said that in the 1960s and 1970s &quot;I was never a peacemaker; I was a fuck-you right-winger.&quot; He has also been an outspoken and unquestioning admirer of the Los Angeles Police Department (despite his explicit depictions of brutality and corruption of the department in his novels), dismissing its flaws as aberrations. He has said that the Rodney King beating and Rampart police scandals were overblown by a biased media. Nevertheless, like other aspects of his persona, he often deliberately obscures where his public persona ends and his actual views begin. When asked about his &quot;right-wing tendencies&quot;, he told an interviewer, &quot;Right-wing tendencies? I do that to fuck with people.&quot; Similarly, in the film &quot;Feast of Death,&quot; his (now ex-) wife describes his politics as &quot;bullshit&quot;, an assessment to which Ellroy responds only with a knowing smile. Privately, Ellroy opposes the death penalty.

In 2001, Ellroy stated that he is opposed to gun control. In the 2000 presidential election, Ellroy voted for George W. Bush &quot;because I wanted to repudiate Gore and Clintonism and nobody hates Bill Clinton more than me...&quot; In 2009, he called Bush a &quot;slimeball and the most disastrous American president in recent times.&quot; He stated that he voted for Barack Obama, though later denied doing so, while adding that most of his statements on modern politics are willful misrepresentations.

Ellroy has frequently shared his thoughts on politicians and political candidates. He has called Hillary Clinton a &quot;bull dyke in a pantsuit&quot;, compared John McCain to Mr. Magoo, Joe Biden to Daffy Duck, and said that &quot;Obama looks like a f---ing lemur, a little rodent-like creature, a marsupial or something.&quot; He has praised President Ronald Reagan on several occasions, calling him a &quot;titanic human being.&quot; On President Donald Trump, Ellroy stated that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t have the charm of a true, world-class dictator&quot;, but also understands his appeal, as &quot;He&#x27;s the big &#x27;fuck you&#x27; to all pieties.&quot;

In 2022, Ellroy stated that he no longer followed contemporary politics.

===Religion===
Following his parents&#x27; divorce, Ellroy was sent to a Dutch Lutheran Church by his mother every Sunday. In 2004, Ellroy had stated &quot;I had a Christian upbringing of sorts, Lutheran. I don&#x27;t go to church. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a Christian.&quot;

However, in 2013, Ellroy stated &quot;I&#x27;m a Christian. I&#x27;m not an Evangelical Christian, but God and religious spiritual feelings always guided me during the worst moments of my life, and I don&#x27;t for a moment doubt it.&quot; In 2014, Ellroy stated that &quot;I&#x27;m a Christian. I believe we are all one soul united in God&quot;, adding that he is &quot;conservative and theocratic&quot;.

Ellroy has stated that his faith has influenced his novels, describing them as &quot;stories of redemption.&quot; He described his 2021 novel &quot;Widespread Panic&quot; as &quot;very much a Christian novel.&quot;

==Film adaptations and screenplays==
Several of Ellroy&#x27;s works have been adapted to film, including &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot; (adapted as &quot;Cop&quot;), &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, &quot;Brown&#x27;s Requiem&quot;, &quot;Killer on the Road/Silent Terror&quot; (adapted as &quot;Stay Clean&quot;), and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. In each instance, screenplays based on Ellroy&#x27;s work have been penned by other screenwriters.

While he has frequently been disappointed by these adaptations (such as &quot;Cop&quot;), he was very complimentary of Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; at the time of its release. In succeeding years, however, his comments have been more reserved:

Shortly after viewing three hours of unedited footage for Brian De Palma&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, Ellroy wrote an essay, &quot;Hillikers&quot;, praising De Palma and his film. Ultimately, nearly an hour was removed from the final cut. Of the released film, Ellroy told the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, &quot;Look, you&#x27;re not going to get me to say anything negative about the movie, so you might as well give up.&quot; He had, however, mocked the film&#x27;s director, cast, and production design before it was filmed.

Ellroy co-wrote the original screenplay for the 2008 film &quot;Street Kings&quot; but refused to do any publicity for the finished film.

In September 2008, &quot;Daily Variety&quot; reported that HBO, along with Tom Hanks&#x27;s production company, Playtone, was developing &quot;American Tabloid&quot; and &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot; for either a miniseries or ongoing series.

In a September 2009 interview, Ellroy himself stated, &quot;All movie adaptations of my books are dead.&quot; In a November 2012 interview, when asked about how movie adaptations distort his books, he remarked, &quot;[Film studios] can do whatever the [fuck] they want as long as they pay me.&quot; As of 2023, Ellroy refuses to answer any questions about both the film adaptions of his books or the scripts he wrote in the 2000s. 

In an October 2017 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Tom Hanks stated he would be interested in playing the part of Lloyd Hopkins if a film or stage adaptation was put into production.

In February of 2024, it was reported Ellroy had signed on with Hollywood talent agency UTA and that producers were shopping a film adaption of his then-latest novel &quot;The Enchanters&quot; around.

<text>Kangwon Province (Kangwŏndo; ) is a province of North Korea, with its capital at Wŏnsan. Before the division of Korea in 1945, Kangwŏn Province and its South Korean neighbour Gangwon Province (also spelled &quot;Kangwon Province&quot; sometimes) formed a single province that excluded Wŏnsan.

==History==

Kangwŏn was one of the Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. The province was formed 1395, and derived its name from the names of the principal cities of Gangneung (or Kangnŭng; ) and the provincial capital Wonju (or Wŏnju; ).

In 1895, Kangwŏn was replaced by the Districts of Chuncheon (&quot;Chuncheon-bu&quot;; ) in the west and Gangneung (&quot;Gangneung-bu&quot;; ) in the east. Wonju became part of Chungju District. During 1910–1945 Japanese colonial period in Korea, the province was known as Kōgen-dō.

In 1896, Korea was redivided into thirteen provinces, and the two districts were merged to re-form Kangwŏn Province. Although Wonju rejoined Kangwŏn province, the provincial capital was moved to Chuncheon.

In 1945, Kangwŏn Province (along with the rest of Korea) was divided by the 38th parallel north in 1945 into Soviet and American zones of occupation in the north and south respectively. In 1946, the northern province was expanded to include the North Korean portion of Gyeonggi Province and the area around Wŏnsan in South Hamgyŏng Province. The provincial capital of the North Korean portion of the province was established at Wŏnsan, as Kangwŏn&#x27;s traditional capitals Wonju and Chuncheon both were south of the 38th parallel. In 1948, the province became part of the new Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea. As a result of the Korean War of 1953, the boundary between the North and South Korean portions of the province was shifted northward to the Military Demarcation Line.

In 2002, Mount Kumgang Tourist Region was split off from the rest of the province to form a separately-administered region. However, in January 2024, after asserting unification as impossible and declaring South Korea a hostile state, North Korea announced that they would close the Mount Kumgang International Tourism Administration.

==Geography==
The province is bordered by South Hamgyŏng to the north, South P&#x27;yŏngan and North Hwanghae to the west, and Kaesŏng to the south. Additionally, the province is across the Korean Demilitarized Zone from its South Korean counterpart Gangwon and Gyeonggi. To the east is the Sea of Japan.

The province is dominated by the T&#x27;aebaek Mountains, the highest peak of which is Mount Kumgang (&quot;Diamond Mountain&quot;).

Kangwŏn and Gangwon Provinces are together referred to as the Gwandong region. The region west of the Taebaek Mountains is called Yŏngsŏ, while the region east of the mountains is called Yŏngdong.

In April 2003, the Mt. Chuae Plant Reserve was created. The reserve is 687 hectares and is in Shindong-ri, Sepho County, and Sanyang-ri, Kosan County. Mt. Chuae is 1,528 meters above sea level and is part of the Masingnyong Mountains. The DPRK Nature Conservation Union is trying to preserve mixed forests of pine and broad-leaf trees. The DPRK Cabinet-level decision has banned animal grazing and collecting plant resources and other acts of damaging the environment.

==Administrative divisions==
Kangwŏn Province is divided into two cities (&quot;si&quot;), one special administrative region, and 15 counties (&quot;kun&quot;).

<doc id="388088" wikidata="Q1134635" url="?curid=388088" title="1994 World Series">
<text>The 1994 World Series was the scheduled championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1994 season. It was canceled due to a strike by the MLB Players Association. The cancelation marked the second time (and to date last) a World Series was not played in a given season and the first since 1904.

==Canceled playoffs==
This was to have been the first year of an expanded eight-team playoff system, with the American League (AL) and National League (NL) realigning into three divisions each (East, Central, and West) at the start of the 1994 season, and the addition of a wild card spot in each league. The NL champion was then intended to be assigned home-field advantage in the 1994 World Series, based on an annual rotation dating back to the mid-1930s in which the World Series opened in the NL city in even-numbered years and opened in the AL city in odd-numbered years. With the postseason canceled, the new playoff system did not go into effect until the 1995 postseason, and the annual World Series rotation (which continued until 2003) was then reversed so that home-field advantage for the 1995 World Series was assigned to the NL champion.

===Atlanta Braves&#x27; run of division titles===
At the time that the strike began, the Montreal Expos had a six game lead in the NL East over the Atlanta Braves, while the Braves had a 2 game lead over the Houston Astros for the NL wild card. As there were no division champions in 1994, the Braves are officially credited with winning 14 consecutive division titles from 1991 to 2005, winning the NL West in the final three years of the two–division system and then winning 11 consecutive NL East titles from 1995 to 2005.

==Television coverage==
1994 was the first season that national telecasts were produced by &quot;The Baseball Network&quot;, a joint venture between MLB, ABC, and NBC. Under the original arrangement, ABC would have broadcast the World Series in even-numbered years (included 1994) and NBC would have televised the series in odd-numbered years. Because the 1994 World Series was cancelled, ABC and NBC shared broadcast rights to the 1995 World Series, after which the joint venture was ended.

<text>was a province of Japan in the area of Japan that is today includes most of modern Mie Prefecture. Ise bordered on Iga, Kii, Mino, Ōmi, Owari, Shima, and Yamato Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was .

==History==
The name of Ise appears in the earliest written records of Japan, and was the site of numerous religious and folkloric events connected with the Shinto religion and Yamato court. Ise province was one of the original provinces of Japan established in the Nara period under the Taihō Code, when the former princely state of Ise was divided into Ise, Iga and Shima. The original capital of the province was located in what is now the city of Suzuka, and was excavated by archaeologists in 1957. The site was proclaimed a national historic landmark in 1986. The remains of the Ise kokubunji have also been found within the boundaries of modern Suzuka. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Ise was ranked as a &quot;great country&quot; () and a &quot;close country&quot; ().

Two Shinto shrines in Ise Province compete for the title of Ichinomiya: Tsubaki Grand Shrine and the Tsubaki Jinja, both of which are located in Suzuka. The Ise Grand Shrine, located in what is now the city of Ise was the destination of pilgrims from the Heian period through modern times.

During the Muromachi period, Ise was ruled nominally by the Kitabatake clan. After the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Ise was divided into several feudal han, the largest of which was Tsu Domain. During the Edo period, the Tōkaidō road from Edo to Kyoto passed through northern Ise, with post stations at several locations.

At the time of the Bakumatsu period, the feudal domains within Ise Province included the following:

After the start of the Meiji period, with the abolition of the han system in 1871, Ise was joined with former Iga and Shima provinces to form the new Mie Prefecture formally created on April 18, 1876.

The name &quot;Ise Province&quot; continued to exist as a geographical anachronism for certain official purposes. For example, Ise is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.

The World War II and modern helicopter carrier &quot;Ise&quot; are named after this province.

<doc id="388121" wikidata="Q109079" url="?curid=388121" title="Kaesong">
<text>Kaesong (, ; ) is a special city in the southern part of North Korea (formerly in North Hwanghae Province), and the capital of Korea during the Taebong kingdom and subsequent Goryeo dynasty. The city is near the Kaesong Industrial Region close to the border with South Korea and contains the remains of the Manwoldae palace. Called Songdo while it was the ancient capital of Goryeo, the city prospered as a trade centre that produced Korean ginseng. Kaesong now functions as North Korea&#x27;s light industry centre.

During the Japanese occupation from 1910 to 1945, the city was known by the Japanese pronunciation of its name, &quot;Kaijō&quot;. Between 1945 and 1950, Kaesong was part of South Korea and under its control. During the Korean War, North Korea captured the city, and the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement left the city under North Korean control. Due to the city&#x27;s proximity to the border with South Korea, Kaesong has hosted cross-border economic exchanges between the two countries as well as the jointly run Kaesong Industrial Region.

As of 2009, the city had a population of 192,578.

==History==
The earliest archaeological signs of habitation in the Kaesong area date from the Neolithic. Artifacts such as Jeulmun pottery, stone ware, and stone axes have been excavated from Osongsan and Kaesong Nasong, the double-walled fortress of Kaesong. As Kaesong has been occupied by various states throughout centuries, its name has changed. It was in the realm of Mahan confederacy, and was referred to as &quot;Busogap&quot; during the rule of Goguryeo. Before the strength of Baekje was retreated to the southwest of Jungnyeong, Mungyeong Saejae, and Asan Bay in 475, the area had been a part of Baekje for about 100 years.

However, it became a territory of Silla in 555, the 16th year of Jinheung of Silla&#x27;s reign, and its name was changed to &quot;Song&#x27;ak-gun&quot; during the period. According to the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, when a castle was built in the site in 694, the third year of Hyoso of Silla&#x27;s reign, Kaesong was referred to as &quot;Song&#x27;ak (송악; 松嶽)&quot;. Therefore, it is assumed that the name Song&#x27;ak had been used at least before the time.

===Goryeo===
Silla began to decline in the late 9th century, and a period of rival warlords ensued. In 898, Kaesong fell under the hand of Gung Ye, the founder of his short-lived state, Taebong, and then became a part of Goryeo in 919 by its founder, Wang Geon, who was enthroned as Taejo of Goryeo. Taejo established the capital in the south of Song&#x27;ak, and incorporated Kaesong into Song&#x27;ak under the name of &quot;Gaeju&quot;. In 919, Kaesong became the national capital. In 960, the 11th year of Gwangjong of Goryeo&#x27;s reign, the city was renamed Gaegyeong, and in 995, the 14th year of Seonjong of Goryeo&#x27;s reign, it was elevated to &quot;Gaesong-bu&quot;. The Gaeseong-bu is a combined term of Song&#x27;ak-gun, and Gaesong-gun, which is different from the region of the pre-1945 Gaesong-ri, Seo-myeon, Kaepung-gun. In 1010, the first year of Hyeonjong of Goryeo&#x27;s reign, the palace and houses were almost burnt down during the second conflict in the Goryeo–Khitan War, so in 1018, Gaesong-bu was relegated for the &quot;bu&quot; system, and became to govern the three hyeon unites of Jeongju, Deoksu, and Gangeum.

In the late 12th century, there was instability in both the government and the countryside. A slave named Manjŏk (or Manjeok) (만적; 萬積) led a group of slaves who gathered outside Kaesong in 1198. The revolt plot was suppressed by Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn. When Yi Song-gye overthrew Goryeo in 1392 and established Joseon as Taejo of Joseon, he moved the Korean capital from Kaesong to Hanyang (modern-day Seoul) in 1394.

=== 20th century ===
Kaesong remained a part of Gyeonggi Province until the Korean War. When Korea was partitioned at the 38th parallel after World War II, Kaesong was on the southern side of the line (within South Korea).

However, the battle of Kaesong-Munsan was won by the Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) in the first days of the Korean War. The city was recaptured by UN Forces on 9 October 1950 during the pursuit of the KPA that followed the successful Inchon landings. UN Forces abandoned the city on 16 December 1950 during the withdrawal to the Imjin River following the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army intervention in the war. Kaesong would remain under Chinese/North Korean control until the end of the war.

Ceasefire negotiations began in Kaesong on 10 July 1951, but were moved to Panmunjom, southeast of the city, on 25 October 1951. The Korean Armistice Agreement signed on 27 July 1953 recognised North Korean control over Kaesong making it the only city to change control from South Korea to North Korea as a result of the war. Postwar Kaesong and the part of Kyonggi Province that came to be occupied was organized into &quot;Kaesong Region&quot; (&quot;Kaesŏng Chigu;&quot; 개성 지구; 開城 地區). In 1957, Kaesong became a &quot;Directly Governed City&quot; (&quot;Kaesŏng Chikhalsi;&quot; 개성 직할시; 開城 直轄市).

=== 21st century ===

In 2002, Kaesŏng Industrial Region was formed from part of Kaesong. In 2003, the remaining part of Kaesong (excluding the Industrial Region) became part of North Hwanghae Province. The city is close to the Demilitarized Zone that divides North and South Korea.

In October 2019, Kaesong became a &quot;Special City&quot;.

==Geography==
Located in the center of Korea, Kaesong is the southernmost city of North Korea. It is bordered by Kaepung, Changpung, Panmun, and Kumchon counties. Kanghwa Island of Incheon Municipality lies just south, beyond a narrow channel. It covers an area of 1,309 km2, the urban district is surrounded by Songak (Songak-san; 송악산; 松嶽山) (489 m) and Pongmyong mountains. The city center surrounds the much smaller Mt. Janam (103 m), on which is located the city&#x27;s Kim Il Sung statue.

In the northern part of Kaesong, the end of the Ahobiryŏng range creates the northernmost border of Kaesong City. This range consists of Mts. Chŏnma (757 m), Sŏnggŏ, Myoji (764 m), Suryong (716 m), Chesŏk (749 m), Hwajang (558 m), and Ogwan. With the exception of the mountainous northeastern region, however, most areas of Kaesong consist of low hills with heights less than 100 meters A.S.L.

The Imjin River flows along the northeastern border line of the city and the Ryesong River (禮成江) (Ryeseong-gang; 례성강) (transliterated in South Korea as Yeseong-gang; 예성강) runs along the western border to the mouth of the Han River. In addition to the two rivers, small and large rivers and streams such as the Samich&#x27;ŏn, Wŏlamch&#x27;ŏn, Chukbaech&#x27;ŏn, Kŭmsŏngch&#x27;ŏn, and Sach&#x27;ŏn rivers drain into the Han. The river basin located in the southwest of Kaesong has spacious alluvial plains such as P&#x27;ungdŏkbŏl, Singwangbŏl, and Samsŏngbŏl.

The geology consists of the Proterozoic, Cenozoic, and Paleozoic strata and Mesozoic intrusive granite. The underground resources include gold, zinc, copper, fluorspar, limestone, granite, and kaolin. The soil comprises generally brown forest soil while the areas drained by Yesŏng, Imjin, and Han rivers consist of mostly alluvial and saline soil. The climate is generally warm and moderate, with an average annual temperature of around 10 °C.

===Climate===
Kaesong has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dwa&quot;), with cold, dry winters and hot, humid summers with abundant rainfall.
==Administrative divisions==
Before 2002, what is now Kaesong Directly Governed City was divided into one city (Kaesŏng itself) and one county and two wards: Changpung County,
Kaepung-guyok and Panmun-guyok. In 2003, P&#x27;anmun-gun and part of Kaesong-si were separated from Kaesŏng Directly Governed City and merged to form Kaesong Industrial Region. The remaining part of Kaesŏng joined North Hwanghae Province in 2002. Kaesong is currently divided into 24 administrative districts known as Dong, as well as three villages (&quot;ri&quot;). After Kaesong promoted 
to Special City, Changpung County, Kaepung-guyok and Panmun-guyok return to Kaesong.

==Culture==

===Landmarks===

Kaesong is home to the World Heritage Site Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong. Koryo Songgyungwan University (Light Industry), Communist University and Art College are located in Kaesong. The Koryo Museum, housed in the city&#x27;s old Confucian academy, contains many priceless Goryeo arts and cultural relics (although many are copies, with the originals held in the vaults of the Korean Central History Museum in Pyongyang).

As the former capital of Goryeo, the tombs of almost all of the Goryeo kings are located in the area, though most are not accessible; the heavily reconstructed Tomb of King Wanggon, belonging to the dynasty&#x27;s founder, Taejo of Goryeo, is located to the west of the city in Kaepung-gun. Other notable tombs include those of kings Hyejong of Goryeo (the Sollung Royal Tomb), Gyeongjong of Goryeo (Yongrung Royal Tomb), Seongjong of Goryeo (Kangrung Royal Tomb), Hyeonjong of Goryeo (Sollung Royal Tomb), Munjong of Goryeo (Kyongrung Royal Tomb), and Gongmin of Goryeo (Tomb of King Kongmin). Kaesong also contains North Korea&#x27;s only two royal tombs dating to the Joseon: the Hurung Royal Tomb, belonging to the dynasty&#x27;s second king, Jeongjong of Joseon, and the Cherung Royal Tomb, containing the remains of Queen Sinui, wife of the dynasty&#x27;s founder, Yi Songgye (Taejo of Joseon). The two final tombs, despite belonging to members of the Joseon royal family, were excluded from the World Heritage Site Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty because of their location in North Korea.

===Cuisine===

Since Kaesong was the capital of Goryeo for 487 years, its culinary culture was highly developed. The luxurious style of Kaesong cuisine is frequently compared with Seoul cuisine and Jeolla cuisine. Kaesong cuisine was traditionally treated as part of Gyeonggi cuisine, since Kaesong belonged to Gyeonggi Province until 1950. However, it has been incorporated into the administration of North Korea after the Korean War while Gyeonggi Province is in South Korea. &quot;Bossam kimchi&quot; (wrapped kimchi), &quot;pyeonsu&quot; (square-shaped summer mandu), &quot;sinseollo&quot; (royal casserole), &quot;seolleongtang&quot; (ox bone soup), &quot;chueotang&quot; (mudfish soup), &quot;joraengi tteokguk&quot; (rice cake soup), &quot;umegi&quot; (tteok covered with syrup), and gyeongdan (ball-shaped &quot;tteok&quot;) are representative Kaesong dishes. &quot;Umegi&quot;, also called &quot;Kaesong juak&quot;, is a holiday food of Kaesong, and known for the delicate style with the sweet and nutty taste. The dish is made by kneading a mixture of rice flour and glutinous rice flour with warm water, by shaping the dough into balls with either one pine nut or jujube, by frying and coating them with syrup.

==Economy==

With its topography, climate and soil, Kaesong has advantageous natural conditions for agricultural productions. The water supply system is established with 18 reservoirs, including Songdo Reservoir, built for agricultural advances and about 150 pumping stations as well as hundreds of dammed pools. The cultivated land accounts for 27% of Kaesong&#x27;s area. Rice, maize, soybeans, wheat, and barley are the main crops. Among them, rice production accounts for 60% of the whole grain production, and Kaepung and Panmun are the two primary regions, producing more than 70% of the rice production. In addition, vegetable and fruit cultivation including peach, apple and persimmon, livestock farming, and sericulture are active. Peach is a local specialty of Kaesong, especially white peach, which accounts for more than 25% of the total fruit production. The counties of Kaepung-gun and Panmun-gun are also known for cultivating the quality Korean ginseng called &quot;Goryeo Insam&quot;.

Kaesong is North Korea&#x27;s light industry centre. The urban district is equipped with a jewel processing factory, ginseng processing factory and an embroidery factory. Since the Goryeo period, Kaesong had been a center of handcrafts such as Goryeo ware and commerce while the textile industry has been the primary business along with the production of grocery goods, daily general goods, and ginseng products after the division into the two states. The food processing industry ranks next to the textile business, mainly producing &quot;jang&quot; (soybean-based condiments), oil, canned foods, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks and others. In addition, resin, timber, handicrafts, pottery, shoes, school supplies, musical instruments, and glass are produced. Kaesong has factories for producing agricultural machines and tractor repair.

As of 2002, the city contained the headquarters of the Central Bank of North Korea, with branches also in Kapung and Panmun counties.

North Korea and South Korea jointly operate an industrial complex in the Kaesong Industrial Region. The industrial park, built around 2005, employs over 53,400 North Koreans at over 120 South Korean textile and other labor-intensive factories. In early 2013, approximately 887 South Koreans worked in the complex, which produced an estimated $470 million of goods in 2012, and the complex employed a sixth of Kaesong&#x27;s working people.

Amid tensions in 2013, the industrial park was temporarily closed. It was closed again in 2016.

===Tourism===

Kaesong is a major destination for foreign visitors to North Korea. Many Goryeo-era sites are located in Kaesong, including the Kaesong Namdaemun gate, the Songgyungwan Confucian Academy, now the Koryo Museum, and the Sonjuk Bridge and Pyochung Pavilion. Less-known sites include Kwandok Pavilion, the ruined Goryeo-era Manwoldae Palace, Anhwa Temple, Sungyang Hall, Mokchong Hall, and the Kaesong Chomsongdae (개성 첨성대; 開城 瞻星臺) observatory. Located to the west of the city are the tombs of Kings Kongmin and Wanggon; twenty-four km north of Kaesong is Taehungsan Fortress, a Koguryo satellite fortress built to protect Pyongyang. This castle contains the Kwanum and Taehung Temples. The famous Pakyon Falls are located in the area, as well as a large, recently discovered Goryeo-era Buddha carved into the stone on Mt. Chonma. Most tourists to Kaesong are put in the traditional Kaesong Folk Hotel, housed in 19 traditional hanok courtyard houses.

==Education==
Sungkyunkwan, one kilometer north of Seonjukgyo bridge is a representative traditional educational institution in Kaesong. It was founded in the neighborhood of Gukja-dong with the name Gukjagam (국자감; 國子監) in 992 during the reign of King Seongjong of Goryeo, which ignited Korean Confucianism. Its name was changed to Gukhak (국학; 國學) in the reign of Chungnyeol of Goryeo and was referred to as &quot;Seonggyungwan&quot;. In 1367, the 16th year of Gongmin of Goryeo&#x27;s reign, the structure was revamped and Yi Saek, and Chŏng Mong-ju, Confucian scholars of the time taught there as professors. In 1592, the 25th year of Seonjo of Joseon&#x27;s reign, Kim Yuk reconstructed the institution which was burned down by the Japanese during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598).

The first modern school that appeared in Kaesong was Hanyeong Seowon (한영서원; 韓英書院), or Anglo-Korean School established by Yun Chi-ho in 1906, with the help of American missionaries Mr. Wasson, and Mr. Candler. It obtained authorization as Songdo High School from Governor-General of Korea in 1917, and expanded to the Songdo School Foundation in 1950 with the accreditation for the establishment of Songdo Middle School and Songdo College of Pharmacy, the latter of which produced 40 graduates. However, when the Korean War occurred, the foundation was moved to Incheon, and reconstructed Songdo Middle and High Schools in 1953 which still exist to the present.

By 1950, there were two public high schools: Kaeseong High School (개성중학교; 開城中學校) and Kaeseong Girls&#x27; High School (개성고등여학교; 開城高等女學校) and three private high schools: Songdo High School (송도중학교; 松都中學校), Jeonghwa Girls&#x27; School (정화여학교;貞和女學校) and Hosudon Girls&#x27; School (호수돈여학교; 好壽敦女學校). Like Songdo High School, Jeonghwa and Hosudon Girls&#x27; Schools, with the teachers and most students, evacuated south during the Korean War and their campuses now are located in Seoul and Daejeon respectively.

There were also eight public elementary schools (국민학교) in Kaeseong by 1950, they were the Manwol (만월; 滿月), Donghyun (동현; 銅峴), Seonjuk (선죽; 善竹), Koryo (고려; 高麗), Songdo (송도; 松都), Junggyeong (중경; 中京), Namsan (남산; 南山) and Deokam (덕암; 德岩) elementary schools.

As of 2002, Kaesong had 80 each public elementary schools which scattered in each unit of &quot;ri&quot; (village), 60 middle-high schools, 3 colleges and 3 universities such as Songdo University of Politics, Kaesong University of Education, and Kaesong Communist University.

==Transportation==
Kaesong is connected to Pyongyang and other cities by rail and highways. The city&#x27;s main railway station is Kaesong Station, which is on the Pyongbu Line.

There was a plan to build a trolleybus line in this city, but it never came to fruition.

<text>The Duchy of Oldenburg (), named for its capital, the town of Oldenburg, was a state in the north-west of present-day Germany. The counts of Oldenburg died out in 1667, after which it became a duchy until 1810, when it was annexed by the First French Empire. It was located near the mouth of the River Weser.

When the main lineage of the House of Oldenburg died out in 1667 with Anthony Günther, Count of Oldenburg, it fell to the Frederick III of Denmark of the line of the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp, who married Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia, daughter of Peter the Great. Another, his first cousin, Frederick August I, became Duke of Oldenburg in 1774. One of his brothers, Adolf Frederick, became King of Sweden. Another brother, Prince Georg Ludwig of Holstein-Gottorp, was father of Peter I, who became Grand Duke of Oldenburg in 1823. All subsequent Rulers of Oldenburg were his descendants.

Its ruling family, the House of Oldenburg, also came to rule in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Greece and Russia. The heir of a junior line of the Greek branch, through Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, hold the thrones of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms after the passing of Queen Elizabeth II.

==History==

The first known count of Oldenburg was Elimar I (d. 1108). Elimar&#x27;s descendants appear as vassals, though sometimes rebellious ones, of the dukes of Saxony; but they attained the dignity of princes of the empire when the emperor Frederick I dismembered the Saxon duchy in 1180. At this time, the county of Delmenhorst formed part of the dominions of the counts of Oldenburg, but afterwards it was on several occasions separated from them to form an appanage for younger branches of the family. This was the case between 1262 and 1447, between 1463 and 1547, and between 1577 and 1617.

During the early part of the 13th century, the counts carried on a series of wars with independent, or semi-independent, Frisian princes to the north and west of the county, which resulted in a gradual expansion of the Oldenburgian territory. The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and the bishop of Münster were also frequently at war with the counts of Oldenburg.

In 1440, Christian succeeded his father Dietrich, called &quot;&quot;, as Count of Oldenburg. In 1448 Christian was elected king of Denmark as Christian I, partly based on his maternal descent from previous Danish kings. Although far away from the Danish borders, Oldenburg was now a Danish exclave. The control over the town was left to the king&#x27;s brothers, who established a short reign of tyranny.

In 1450, Christian became king of Norway and in 1457, king of Sweden. In 1460, he inherited the Duchy of Schleswig and the County of Holstein, an event of high importance for the future history of Oldenburg. In 1454, he handed over Oldenburg to his brother Gerhard (about 1430–99), a wild prince, who was constantly at war with the prince-bishop of Bremen and other neighbors. In 1483, Gerhard was compelled to abdicate in favor of his sons, and he died while on pilgrimage in Spain.

Early in the 16th century, Oldenburg was again enlarged at the expense of the Frisians. Lutheranism was introduced into the county by Anthony I (1505–73, r. from 1529), who also suppressed the monasteries; however, he remained loyal to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor during the Schmalkaldic War, and was able thus to increase his territories, obtaining Delmenhorst in 1547. One of Anthony&#x27;s brothers, Christopher (about 1506–60), won some reputation as a soldier.

Anthony&#x27;s grandson, Anthony Günther (1583–1667), who succeeded in 1603, considered himself the wisest prince who had yet ruled Oldenburg. Jever had been acquired before he became count, but in 1624 he added Kniphausen and Varel to his lands, with which in 1647 Delmenhorst was finally united. By his neutrality during the Thirty Years&#x27; War and by donating valuable horses to the warlord, the Count of Tilly, Anthony Günther secured for his dominions an immunity from the terrible devastation to which nearly all the other states of Germany were exposed. He also obtained from the emperor the right to levy tolls on vessels passing along the Weser, a lucrative grant which soon formed a material addition to his resources. In 1607 he erected a schloss in the Renaissance architectural style. After the death of Anthony Günther, Oldenburg fell again under Danish authority.

Under the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo, Christian VII of Denmark surrendered the county to Catherine the Great in exchange for her son and heir Paul&#x27;s share in the condominial royal-ducal government of the Duchy of Holstein and his claims to the ducal share in the government of the Duchy of Schleswig; Oldenburg went to Frederick August, Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck, the representative of a younger branch of the family, and in 1777 the county was raised to the rank of a duchy. The duke&#x27;s son William, who succeeded his father in 1785, was a man of weak intellect, and his cousin Peter, Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck, acted as regent and eventually, in 1823, inherited the throne, holding the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck and Oldenburg in personal union.

By the German Mediatisation of 1803, Oldenburg acquired the Oldenburg Münsterland and the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck. Between 1810 and 1814, Oldenburg was occupied by Napoleonic France. Its annexation into the French Empire, in 1810, was one of the causes for the diplomatic rift between former allies France and Russia, a dispute that would lead to war in 1812 and eventually to Napoleon&#x27;s downfall.

===Jewish history===

The oldest documentation of Jews living in the Duchy of Oldenburg is dated to the Middle Ages. The Jewish grand community of the Duchy consisted of the Delmenhorst, Jever, Varel, Vechta and Wildeshausen communities. Other documentations report of a Jewish deportation from Wildeshausen at around 1348, during the time of the Black death, though they came back short after, as mentioned in other documents Jewish presence continued to be reported, especially in the main city of Oldenburg but also in the villages surrounding it, and the total Jewish community of the area of the duchy in 1900 raised to 1359, but declined to 1015 in 1925. By 1933, only 279 Jews were left in the area, and the most of them were annihilated during the Holocaust, though some survived and returned after the war.

The duchy was the last part of Napoleon&#x27;s conquered lands to complete his 1808 decree that the Jews adopt surnames. The names picked at that time are the ones popular nowadays among Ashkenazi Jews.

==Aftermath==
In 1815, the Duchy acquired the Principality of Birkenfeld and became a grand duchy. In 1871, Oldenburg joined the German Empire, and in 1918, it became a free state within the Weimar Republic.

In 1937 (with the Greater Hamburg Act), it lost the exclave districts of Eutin near the Baltic coast and Birkenfeld in southwestern Germany to Prussia and gained the City of Wilhelmshaven. However, this was a formality, as the Hitler régime had &quot;de facto&quot; abolished the federal states in 1934. By the beginning of World War II in 1939, as a result of these territorial changes, Oldenburg had an area of and 580,000 inhabitants.

In 1946, after World War II, Oldenburg merged into the newly founded state of Lower Saxony and formed, territorially unchanged, the administrative region (&#x27;) of Oldenburg. The Region and State both became a part of West Germany in 1949. The administrative region was abolished in 1978 and merged with neighbouring governorates (&#x27;) into the new region of Weser-Ems, which was dissolved in 2004.

<text>Jacobus Arminius (; Dutch: &quot;Jakob Hermanszoon&quot; ; 10 October 1560 – 19 October 1609) was a Dutch Reformed minister and theologian during the Protestant Reformation period whose views became the basis of Arminianism and the Dutch Remonstrant movement. He served from 1603 as professor in theology at the University of Leiden and wrote many books and treatises on theology.

Following his death, his challenge to the Reformed standard, the &quot;Belgic Confession&quot;, provoked ample discussion at the Synod of Dort, which crafted the five points of Calvinism in response to Arminius&#x27;s teaching.

== Early life ==

Jakob Hermanszoon was born in 1559 or 1560 in Oudewater, Utrecht, Netherlands. He became an orphan while still young. His father Herman, a manufacturer of weapons, died, leaving his wife a widow with small children. He never knew his father, and his mother was killed during the Spanish massacre at Oudewater in 1575.

The child was adopted by Theodorus Aemilius, a priest inclined towards Protestantism. Around 1572 (the year Oudewater was conquered by the rebels), Arminius and Aemilius settled in Utrecht. The young Jacobus studied there, probably at the Hieronymusschool. After the death of Aemilius (1574 or 1575), Arminius became acquainted with the mathematician Rudolph Snellius, also from Oudewater. Snellius brought Arminius to Marburg and enabled him to study at the Leiden University.

==Theological studies and ministry==
Arminius remained a student at Leiden from 1576 to 1582. Although he enrolled as a student in liberal arts, this allowed him to pursue an education in theology. His teachers in theology included Calvinist Lambertus Danaeus, Hebrew scholar Johannes Drusius, Guillaume Feuguereius (or Feugueires, d. 1613), and Johann Kolmann. Kolmann is now known for teaching that the overemphasis of God&#x27;s sovereignty in high Calvinism made God &quot;a tyrant and an executioner&quot;. Although the university in Leiden was solidly Reformed, it had influences from Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Anabaptist views in addition to Calvinism. One Leiden pastor (Caspar Coolhaes) held—in opposition to John Calvin—that civil authorities did have jurisdiction in some church affairs, that it was wrong to punish and execute heretics, and that Lutherans, Calvinists, and Anabaptists could unite around core tenets. The astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius used Ramist philosophy in an effort to encourage his students to pursue truth without over reliance on Aristotle. Under the influence of these men, Arminius studied with success and may have had seeds planted that would begin to develop into a theology that would later question the dominant Reformed theology of Calvin. The success he showed in his studies motivated the merchants guild of Amsterdam to fund the next three years of his studies.

In 1582 Arminius began studying under Theodore Beza at Geneva. He found himself under pressure for using Ramist philosophical methods, familiar to him from his time at Leiden. Arminius was publicly forbidden to teach Ramean philosophy. After this difficult state of affairs, he moved to Basel to continue his studies. He continued to distinguish himself there as an excellent student. In 1583 Arminius was contemplating a return to Geneva when the theological faculty at Basel spontaneously offered him a doctorate. He declined the honor on account of his youth (he was about 24) and returned to the school in Geneva to finish his schooling under Beza.

===Commendations===
Upon the conclusion of Arminius&#x27; studies and a request for him to pastor in Amsterdam, Beza replied to leaders in Amsterdam with this letter:

&quot;...Let it be known to you that from the time Arminius returned to us from Basel, his life and learning both have so approved themselves to us, that we hope for the best from him in every respect, if he steadily persists in the same course, which, by the blessing of God, we doubt not he will; for, among other endowments, God has given him an intellect well-suited both to the apprehension and to the discrimination of things. If this henceforward be regulated by piety, which he appears assiduously to cultivate, it cannot but happen that this power of intellect, when consolidated by mature age and experience, will be productive of the richest fruits. Such is our opinion of Arminius — a young man, unquestionably, so far as we are able to judge, most worthy of your kindness and liberality&quot; (Letter of 3 June 1585 from Beza to Amsterdam).

From this letter it would seem that the earlier tension from Arminius&#x27; attraction to Ramist philosophy had dissipated and Arminius was known even to Beza as an excellent though budding theologian. Three months later, John Grynaeus at the University of Basel sent this letter of commendation:

&quot;To pious readers, greeting: &#x27;Inasmuch as a faithful testimonial of learning and piety ought not to be refused to any learned and pious man, so neither to James Arminius, a native of Amsterdam [sic], for his deportment while he attended the University of Basel was marked by piety, moderation, and assiduity in study ; and very often, in the course of our theological discussions, he made his gift of a discerning spirit so manifest to all of us, as to elicit from us well-merited congratulations. More recently, too, in certain extraordinary prelections delivered with the consent, and by the order, of the Theological Faculty, in which he publicly expounded a few chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, he gave us the best ground to hope that he was destined erelong — if, indeed, he goes on to stir up the gift of God that is in him — to undertake and sustain the function of teaching, to which he may be lawfully set apart, with much fruit to the Church. I commend him, accordingly, to all good men, and, in particular, to the Church of God in the famous city of Amsterdam ; and I respectfully entreat that regard may be had to that learned and pious youth, so that he may never be under the necessity of intermitting theological studies which have been thus far so happily prosecuted. Farewell ! &#x27;John James Grynaeus, Professor of Sacred Literature, and Dean of the Theological Faculty. — Written with mine own hand. Basle, 3rd September, 1583.&quot;

===Beginning of public ministry===

Arminius answered the call to pastor at Amsterdam in 1587, delivering Sunday and midweek sermons. After being tested by the church leaders, he was ordained in 1588. One of Arminius&#x27; first tasks was given to him by Ecclesiastical Court of Amsterdam; namely, to refute the teachings of Dirck Coornhert, who rejected Beza&#x27;s supralapsarian doctrine of God&#x27;s absolute and unconditional decree to create men so as to save some and damn others, based on nothing in themselves. The discussion had already begun with two ministers at Delft who had written &quot;An Answer to certain Arguments of Beza and Calvin, from a Treatise on Predestination as taught in the Ninth Chapter of Romans&quot; a document which contradicted both Beza and Coornhert. They proposed that although God&#x27;s decree to save only some was indeed absolute and unconditional, it had occurred after the fall (proposing infralapsarianism rather than Beza&#x27;s supralapsarianism). Arminius was tasked with refuting both Coornhert and infralapsarianism theology. He readily agreed to the task, but after greater study he was conflicted over the matter. He determined to spend greater time in study before continuing his refutation.

In 1590 he married Lijsbet Reael, the daughter of Laurens Jacobsz Reael, a prominent merchant and poet in Amsterdam who also helped lead the Protestant Reformation and later helped establish the first Reformed Church in the area. Arminius&#x27;s marriage to Reael allowed him access to her prestigious connections, and he made many friends in the merchant industry and high society. He was commissioned to organize the educational system of Amsterdam and is said to have done it well. He greatly distinguished himself by faithfulness to his duties in 1602 during a plague that swept through Amsterdam, going into infected houses that others did not dare to enter in order to give them water, and supplying their neighbors with funds to care for them.

===Controversy===
At Amsterdam, Arminius taught through &quot;a number of sermons on the Epistle of the Romans&quot;. In discussing Romans 7 in 1591, he taught that man, through grace and rebirth, did not have to live in bondage to sin, and that Romans 7:14 was speaking of a man living under the law and convicted of sin by the Holy Spirit, yet not presently regenerated. This was met with some resistance, and some detractors labeled him Pelagian for teaching that an unregenerate man could feel such conviction and desire for salvation, even with the influence of the Law and the Holy Spirit. In the same year, responding to Arminius&#x27; theological positions, his colleague Petrus Plancius began to dispute him openly. During a gathering of ministers, Arminius insisted he was not teaching anything in contradiction to the Heidelberg Confession and other standards of orthodoxy, that early church theologians held similar views, and that he utterly repudiated the heresy of Pelagianism. Further, Arminius expressed some astonishment that he was not to be allowed to interpret this passage according to the dictates of his own conscience and within the pattern of historic orthodoxy. The Amsterdam burgomasters intervened in an effort to keep the peace and tamp down divisions in the populace, urging them to peacefully coexist and for Arminius to teach nothing out of accord with the Reformed thought agreed upon at the time unless he had consulted with the church council or other bodies.

During the following years, controversy emerged as he preached through Romans 9. Although he did not directly contradict Calvinist interpretations, he focused on Paul&#x27;s theme of &quot;justification by faith&quot; in contradiction to works, rather than focusing on God&#x27;s eternal decrees. During this time he gradually developed opinions on grace, predestination and free will that were inconsistent with the doctrine of the Reformed teachers Calvin and Beza.

==Professor at Leiden==
In 1603 he was called back to Leiden University to teach theology. This came about after almost simultaneous deaths in 1602 of two faculty members, Franciscus Junius and Lucas Trelcatius the elder, in an outbreak of plague. Trelcatius the younger and Arminius (despite Plancius&#x27; protest) were appointed, the decision resting largely with Franciscus Gomarus, the surviving faculty member. While Gomarus cautiously approved Arminius, whose views were already suspected of unorthodoxy, his arrival opened a period of debate rather than closed it. The appointment had also a political dimension, being backed by both Johannes Uytenbogaert at The Hague and Johan van Oldenbarnevelt.

===Escalating controversy with Gomarus===
Gomarus, a Fleming who had been in Leiden since 1594, has been described as &quot;a rather mediocre scholar&quot; but &quot;a forceful defender of the Calvinistic doctrine... a man of deep-rooted faith&quot; In contrast Arminius has been described as &quot;a seeker, a doubter&quot;. On the question of predestination Gomarus was a supralapsarian, and it was in debate over this point that the conflict between the two began. Arminius advocated revising the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism but was not explicit until much later when the debate became an open conflict.

The dispute took a public turn on 7 February 1604 when Willem Bastingius in his disputation &quot;De divina praedestinatione&quot; defended several of Arminius&#x27;s theses with Arminius presiding. This event led Gomarus to have Samuel Gruterus argue an opposite position on 14 October 1604, but the argument was not on the official schedule. Gomarus ascribed the positions he disliked to Calvin&#x27;s adversary Sebastian Castellio and his follower Coornhert. While Arminius pointed to the Bible to defend his positions, the Calvinist views set forth by &quot;the Genevan patriarchs gradually acquired the force of &quot;Res judicata&quot;, so that resistance against it was no longer tolerated.&quot;

Opponents of Arminius outside the university gradually expanded the controversy. The classis in Dordrecht drew up a gravamen in which &quot;some differences&quot; that &quot;were said to have arisen in the Church and University of Leiden on the doctrine of the Reformed Churches&quot; was laid out. In response the three Leiden professors of theology (Trelcatius joining Arminius and Gomarus) and the Regent of the State College, Johannes Cuchlinus, wrote an indignant letter, stating &quot;that as far as was known to them there was no conflict between the professors on any fundamental doctrine whatsoever.&quot;

Gomarus was incited to increase his opposition to Arminius by Leiden minister Festus Hommius and Plancius, Arminius&#x27;s old opponent. An anonymous series of 31 articles was circulated, &quot;in which all kinds of unorthodox opinions held by Arminius were exposed&quot;. Sibrandus Lubbertus, Professor of Theology at the University of Franeker, began sending letters to foreign theologians attacking Arminius with charges of heresy; and one of these letters fell into Arminius&#x27;s hands. Because his opponents remained anonymous or bypassed official procedures, Arminius in April 1608 requested from the States of Holland permission to expound his views. On 30 May 1608 Arminius and Gomarus were allowed by the States to deliver speeches before the Supreme Court in The Hague. Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Reinout van Brederode (Oldenbarnevelt&#x27;s son-in-law) concluded that &quot;the points of difference between the two professors, mostly relating to the subtle details of doctrine of predestination, were of minor importance and could co-exist... [and] enjoined both gentlemen to tolerate one another lovingly&quot;.

In direct defiance of the court, Gomarus then published the speech he had made before it, and Arminius followed suit by publishing his own speech. In response to the court&#x27;s opinion Gomarus declared that &quot;he would not dare die holding Arminius&#x27; opinion, nor to appear with it before God&#x27;s judgement seat.&quot; Arminius then asked to defend his positions in public or for a national or provincial synod to be called to examine the matter. Seeking to avoid a synod, the States of Holland allowed Arminius to expound on his views to their assembly on 30 October 1608.

Before the assembly, Arminius finally explained his call to rewrite the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism, saying that he did not feel obligated to explain his position before, for &quot;as a professor, he considered himself subject only to the authority of the Leiden Curators and the States, not to the Church&quot;. Arminius then gave an overview of all the various opinions existing on predestination. He claimed that supralapsarianism was contrary to the Confession and Catechism and that &quot;supra- and infralapsarianism, basically amount to the same thing.&quot; Arminius put forward his own view on predestination which he held was in concordance with the Confession and the Catechism.

Learning that Arminius had appeared before the States assembly, Gomarus requested permission to address it as well, which was granted. On 12 December 1608 Gomarus blasted Arminius, accusing &quot;his colleague of being a supporter of Pelagianism and the Jesuits; he also attacked Johannes Wtenbogaert, whom he branded a &#x27;courtly trumpeter.&#x27;&quot; The assembly took offence against this polemical tone, which contrasted with Arminius&#x27;s eirenicism, and ordered the speeches made before them by both men to be banned from publication. Despite the ban the speeches soon appeared in print.

On 25 July 1609 Jacobus Bontebal defended the theses &quot;De vocatione hominis ad salutem&quot; under Arminius&#x27;s presidency. A Roman Catholic priest (rumored to be a Jesuit) was in the audience and dared to oppose Arminius&#x27; positions. While an already seriously ill Arminius refuted the arguments, Gomarus &quot;who was among the audience, became alternately flushing and deathly pale, and afterwards, while the Papist was within earshot, he insultingly remarked to his colleague that now the door to Papism had been widely opened.&quot;

===Final debate and last days===

Arminius remained as a teacher at Leiden until his death and was valued by his students. Still, the conflict with Gomarus widened out into a large-scale split within Calvinism. Of the local clergy, Adrianus Borrius supported Arminius, while Festus Hommius opposed him. Close friends, students and supporters of Arminius included Johannes Drusius, Conrad Vorstius, Anthony Thysius, Johannes Halsbergius, Petrus Bertius, Johannes Arnoldi Corvinus, as well as the brothers Rembert and Simon Episcopius. His successor at Leiden (again selected with the support of Uytenbogaert and Oldenbarnevelt) was Vorstius, a past influence on Arminius by his writings.

Once again the States attempted to tamp down the growing controversy without calling a synod. Arminius was ordered to attend another conference with Gomarus in The Hague in on 13–14 August 1609. When the conference was to reconvene on 18 August, Arminius&#x27; health began to fail and so he returned to Leiden. The States suspended the conference and asked both men for a written reaction to their adversary&#x27;s viewpoint.

Arminius died on 19 October 1609 at his house at the Pieterskerkhof. He was buried in the Pieterskerk at Leiden, where a memorial stone on his behalf was placed in 1934.

== Theology and legacy ==
In attempting to defend Calvinistic predestination against the teachings of Coornhert, Arminius began to doubt aspects of Calvinism and modified some parts of his own view. He attempted to reform Calvinism and lent his name to a movement—Arminianism—which resisted some of the Calvinist tenets (unconditional election, the nature of the limitation of the atonement, and irresistible grace). The early Dutch followers of his teaching became known as Remonstrants after they issued a document containing five points of disagreement with mainstream Calvinism, entitled &quot;Remonstrantiæ&quot; (1610). Arminius wrote that he sought to teach only those things which could be proved from the Scriptures and that tended toward edification among Christians (with the exception of Roman Catholics, with whom he said there could be no spiritual accord). His motto was reputed to be &quot;Bona conscientia paradisus&quot;, meaning, &quot;A good conscience is a paradise.&quot;

Arminius taught of a &quot;preventing&quot; (or prevenient) grace that has been conferred upon all by the Holy Spirit and this grace is &quot;sufficient for belief, in spite of our sinful corruption, and thus for salvation.&quot; Arminius states &quot;the grace sufficient for salvation is conferred on the Elect, and on the Non-elect; that, if they will, they may believe or not believe, may be saved or not be saved.&quot; William Witt states that &quot;Arminius has a very high theology of grace. He insists emphatically that grace is gratuitous because it is obtained through God&#x27;s redemption in Christ, not through human effort.&quot;

The theology of Arminianism did not become fully developed during Arminius&#x27; lifetime, but after his death the &quot;Five articles of the Remonstrants&quot; (1610) systematized and formalized the ideas. But the Calvinist Synod of Dort (1618–19), convening for the purpose of condemning Arminius&#x27; theology, declared it and its adherents anathemas, defined the five points of Calvinism, and persecuted Arminian pastors who remained in the Netherlands. But in spite of persecution, &quot;the Remonstrants continued in Holland as a distinct church and again and again where Calvinism was taught Arminianism raised its head.&quot;

In the 18th century John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Movement, came to his own religious beliefs while in college and through his Aldersgate Experience or epiphany and expressed himself strongly against the doctrines of Calvinistic election and reprobation. His system of thought has become known as Wesleyan Arminianism, the foundations of which were laid by Wesley and his fellow preacher John William Fletcher. Although Wesley knew very little about the beliefs of Arminius and arrived at his religious views independently, Wesley acknowledged late in life—with the 1778 publication of &quot;The Arminian Magazine&quot;—that he and Arminius were in general agreement. Theology Professor W. Stephen Gunther concludes he was &quot;a faithful representative&quot; of Arminius&#x27; beliefs. Wesley was perhaps the clearest English proponent of Arminianism. He embraced Arminian theology and became its most prominent champion. , the majority of Methodists remain committed (knowingly or unknowingly) to Arminian theology, and Arminianism has become one of the dominant theological systems in the United States, thanks in large part to the influence of John and Charles Wesley.

== Personal life ==
Arminius and his wife Lijsbet Laurensdochtor Reael, who married in 1590, had 12 children, three of whom died young during infancy. They had ten sons; Harmen (b. 1594), Pieter (b. 1596), Jan (b. 1598), Laurens (b. 1600, died in infancy), Laurens (b. 1601), Jacob (b. 1603), Willem (b. 1605), and Daniel (b. 1606). They had two other sons who also died in infancy, whose names are not part of the public record. Their daughters were Engelte (b. 1593) and Geertruyd (b. 1608). He was survived by his wife and children when he died.

<doc id="388133" wikidata="Q8451511" url="?curid=388133" title="Salvation in Christianity">
<text>In Christianity, salvation (also called deliverance or redemption) is the saving of human beings from sin and its consequences—which include death and separation from God—by Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection, and the justification entailed by this salvation.

The idea of Jesus&#x27; death as an atonement for human sin was recorded in the Christian Bible, and was elaborated in Paul&#x27;s epistles and in the Gospels. Paul saw the faithful redeemed by participation in Jesus&#x27; death and rising. Early Christians regarded themselves as partaking in a new covenant with God, open to both Jews and Gentiles, through the sacrificial death and subsequent exaltation of Jesus Christ. 

Early Christian beliefs of the person and sacrificial role of Jesus in human salvation were further elaborated by the Church Fathers, medieval writers and modern scholars in various atonement theories, such as the ransom theory, Christus Victor theory, recapitulation theory, satisfaction theory, penal substitution theory and moral influence theory.

Variant views on salvation (soteriology) are among the main fault lines dividing the various Christian denominations, including conflicting definitions of sin and depravity (the sinful nature of mankind), justification (God&#x27;s means of removing the consequences of sin), and atonement (the forgiving or pardoning of sin through the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus).

==Definition and scope==

Salvation in Christianity, or deliverance or redemption, is the &quot;saving [of] human beings from death and separation from God&quot; by Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection.

Christian salvation not only concerns the atonement itself, but also the question of how one partakes of this salvation, by faith, baptism, or obedience; and the question of whether this salvation is individual or universal. It further involves questions regarding the afterlife, e.g. &quot;heaven, hell, purgatory, soul sleep, and annihilation.&quot; The fault lines between the various denominations include conflicting definitions of sin, justification, and atonement.

==Sin==

In the West (differentiating from Eastern Orthodoxy) Christian hamartiology describes sin as an act of offence against God by despising his persons and Christian biblical law, and by injuring others. It is an evil human act, which violates the rational nature of man, as well as God&#x27;s nature and his eternal law. According to the classical definition of Augustine of Hippo, sin is &quot;a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God&quot;.

Christian tradition has explained sin as a fundamental aspect of human existence, brought about by original sin—also called ancestral sin, the fall of man stemming from Adam&#x27;s rebellion in Eden by eating the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Paul espouses it in Romans 5:12–19, and Augustine of Hippo popularized his interpretation of it in the West, developing it into a notion of &quot;hereditary sin,&quot; arguing that God holds all the descendants of Adam and Eve accountable for Adam&#x27;s sin of rebellion, and as such all people deserve God&#x27;s wrath and condemnation—apart from any actual sins they personally commit.

Total depravity (also called &quot;radical corruption&quot; or &quot;pervasive depravity&quot;) is a Protestant theological doctrine derived from the concept of original sin. It is the teaching that, as a consequence of the fall of man, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of sin as a result of their inherent fallen nature and, apart from the irresistible or prevenient grace of God, is utterly unable to choose to follow God, refrain from evil, or accept the gift of salvation as it is offered. It is advocated to various degrees by many Protestant confessions of faith and catechisms, including those of some Lutheran synods, and Calvinism, teaching irresistible grace. Arminians, such as Methodists, also believe and teach total depravity, but with the distinct difference of teaching prevenient grace.

==Justification==

In Christian theology, justification is God&#x27;s act of removing the guilt and penalty of sin while at the same time making a sinner righteous through Christ&#x27;s atoning sacrifice. The means of justification is an area of significant difference among Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. Justification is often seen as being the theological fault line that divided the Catholic from the Lutheran and Reformed traditions of Protestantism during the Reformation.

Broadly speaking, Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Christians distinguish between initial justification, which in their view ordinarily occurs at baptism; and final salvation, accomplished after a lifetime of striving to do God&#x27;s will (theosis or divinization).

&quot;Theosis&quot; is a transformative process whose aim is likeness to or union with God, as taught by the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches. As a process of transformation, &quot;theosis&quot; is brought about by the effects of &quot;catharsis&quot; (purification of mind and body) and &quot;theoria&quot; (&#x27;illumination&#x27; with the &#x27;vision&#x27; of God). According to Eastern Christian teaching, &quot;theosis&quot; is very much the purpose of human life. It is considered achievable only through a synergy (or cooperation) between human activity and God&#x27;s uncreated energies (or operations). The synonymous term &quot;divinization&quot; is the transforming effect of divine grace, the Spirit of God, or the atonement of Christ. &quot;Theosis&quot; and &quot;divinization&quot; are distinguished from sanctification, &quot;being made holy,&quot; which can also apply to objects; and from &quot;apotheosis&quot;, also &quot;divinization,&quot; ).

Catholics believe faith which is active in charity and good works () can justify, or remove the burden of guilt in sin, from man. Forgiveness of sin exists and is natural, but justification can be lost by mortal sin.

In the Protestant doctrine, sin is merely &quot;covered&quot; and righteousness imputed. In Lutheranism and Calvinism, righteousness from God is viewed as being credited to the sinner&#x27;s account through faith alone, without works. Protestants believe faith without works can justify man because Christ died for sinners, but anyone who truly has faith will produce good works as a product of faith, as a good tree produces good fruit. For Lutherans, justification can be lost with the loss of faith.

==Atonement==
The word &quot;atonement&quot; often is used in the Old Testament to translate the Hebrew words (, m.sg.) and (, m.pl.), which mean &quot;propitiation&quot; or &quot;expiation&quot;; The English word &quot;atonement&quot; is derived from the original meaning of &quot;at-one-ment&quot; (i.e., being &quot;at one&quot; or in harmony, with someone). According to Collins English Dictionary, &quot;atonement&quot; is used to describe the saving work that God granted (through Christ) to reconcile the world to himself, and also of the state of a person having been reconciled to God. According to &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church&quot;, atonement in Christian theology is &quot;man&#x27;s reconciliation with God through the sacrificial death of Christ.&quot;

Many Christians believe in unlimited atonement; however, some Christians teach limited atonement to those who are predestined unto salvation, as its primary benefits are not given to all of mankind but rather to believers only.

===Theories of atonement===
A number of metaphors (and Old Testament terms) and references have been used in New Testament writings to understand the person and death of Jesus. Starting in the 2nd century CE, various understandings of atonement have been put forth to explain the death and resurrection of Jesus, as well as the metaphors applied by the New Testament to understand his death. Over the centuries, Christians have held different ideas regarding how Jesus saves people, with different views still existing within various Christian denominations. According to the biblical scholar C. Marvin Pate, &quot;...there are three aspects to Christ&#x27;s atonement according to the early Church: vicarious atonement [substitutionary atonement], the eschatological defeat of Satan [Christ the Victor], and the imitation of Christ [participation in Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection].&quot; Pate further notes that these three aspects were intertwined in the earliest Christian writings but that this intertwining was lost since the Patristic times. Because of the influence of Gustaf Aulén&#x27;s 1931 study, the various theories or paradigms of atonement which developed after the New Testament writings are often grouped under the &quot;classic paradigm,&quot; the &quot;objective paradigm,&quot; and the &quot;subjective paradigm&quot;.

===Old Testament===

In the Hebrew writings, God is absolutely righteous, and only pure and sinless persons can approach him. Reconciliation is achieved by an act of God, namely by his appointment of the sacrificial system, or, in the prophetic view, &quot;by the future Divine gift of a new covenant to replace the old covenant which sinful Israel has broken.&quot; The Old Testament describes three types of vicarious atonement which result in purity or sinlessness: the Paschal Lamb; &quot;the sacrificial system as a whole,&quot; with the Day of Atonement as the most essential element; and the idea of the suffering servant (Isaiah 42:1–9, 49:1–6, 50:4–11, 52:13–53:12), &quot;the action of a Divinely sent Servant of the Lord who was &#x27;wounded for our transgressions&#x27; and &#x27;bear the sin of many&#x27;.&quot; The Old Testament Apocrypha adds a fourth idea, namely the righteous martyr (2 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, Wisdom 2–5).

These traditions of atonement offer only temporary forgiveness, and (offerings) could only be used as a means of atoning for the lightest type of sin, that is sins committed in ignorance that the thing was a sin. In addition, have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents of their actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation. Marcus Borg notes that animal sacrifice in Second Temple Judaism was not a &quot;payment for sin&quot;, but had a basic meaning as &quot;making something sacred by giving it as a gift to God,&quot; and included a shared meal with God. Sacrifices had numerous purposes, namely thanksgiving, petition, purification, and reconciliation. None of them was a &quot;payment or substitution or satisfaction&quot;, and even &quot;sacrifices of reconciliation were about restoring the relationship.&quot; James F. McGrath refers to 4 Maccabees 6, &quot;which presents a martyr praying “Be merciful to your people, and let our punishment suffice for them. Make my blood their purification, and take my life in exchange for theirs” (4 Macc. 6:28-29). Clearly there were ideas that existed in the Judaism of the time that helped make sense of the death of the righteous in terms of atonement.&quot;

===New Testament===

====Jerusalem ====
1 Corinthians 15:3–8 contains the of the early Christians: 
In the Jerusalem , from which Paul received this creed, the phrase &quot;died for our sins&quot; probably was an apologetic rationale for the death of Jesus as being part of God&#x27;s plan and purpose, as evidenced in the scriptures. The phrase &quot;died for our sins&quot; was derived from Isaiah, especially Isaiah 53:1–11, and 4 Maccabees, especially 4 Maccabees 6:28–29. &quot;Raised on the third day&quot; is derived from Hosea 6:1–2: 
Soon after his death, Jesus&#x27; followers believed he was raised from death by God and exalted to divine status as Lord () &quot;at God&#x27;s &#x27;right hand&#x27;,&quot; which &quot;associates him in astonishing ways with God.&quot; According to Hurtado, powerful religious experiences were an indispensable factor in the emergence of this Christ-devotion. Those experiences &quot;seem to have included visions of (and/or ascents to) God&#x27;s heaven, in which the glorified Christ was seen in an exalted position.&quot; Those experiences were interpreted in the framework of God&#x27;s redemptive purposes, as reflected in the scriptures, in a &quot;dynamic interaction between devout, prayerful searching for, and pondering over, scriptural texts and continuing powerful religious experiences.&quot; This initiated a &quot;new devotional pattern unprecedented in Jewish monotheism,&quot; that is, the worship of Jesus next to God, giving a central place to Jesus because his ministry, and its consequences, had a strong impact on his early followers. Revelations, including those visions, but also inspired and spontaneous utterances, and &quot;charismatic exegesis&quot; of the Jewish scriptures, convinced them that this devotion was commanded by God.

====Paul====

The meaning of the of 1 Corinthians 15:3–8 for Paul is a matter of debate, and open to multiple interpretations. For Paul, &quot;dying for our sins&quot; gained a deeper significance, providing &quot;a basis for the salvation of sinful Gentiles apart from the Torah.&quot;

Traditionally, this is interpreted as meaning that Jesus&#x27; death was an &quot;atonement&quot; for sin, or a ransom, or a means of propitiating God or expiating God&#x27;s wrath against humanity because of their sins. With Jesus&#x27; death, humanity was freed from this wrath. In the classical Protestant understanding humans partake in this salvation by faith in Jesus Christ; this faith is a grace given by God, and people are justified by God through Jesus Christ and faith in him.

A predecessor researcher for the New Perspective on Paul (in 1963) raised several concerns regarding these interpretations. The traditional interpretation sees Paul&#x27;s understanding of salvation as involving &quot;an exposition of the individual&#x27;s relation to God.&quot; According to Krister Stendahl, the main concern of Paul&#x27;s writings on Jesus&#x27; role, and salvation by faith, is not the individual conscience of human sinners, and their doubts about being chosen by God or not, but the problem of the inclusion of Gentile (Greek) Torah observers into God&#x27;s covenant. Paul draws on several interpretative frames to solve this problem, but most importantly, his own experience and understanding. The from 1 Cor.15:3-5 refers to two mythologies: the Greek myth of the noble dead, to which the Maccabean notion of martyrdom and dying for ones people is related; and the Jewish myth of the persecuted sage or righteous man, in particular the &quot;story of the child of wisdom.&quot; For Paul, the notion of &#x27;dying for&#x27; refers to this martyrdom and persecution. According to Burton Mack, &#x27;Dying for our sins&#x27; refers to the problem of Gentile Torah-observers, who, despite their faithfulness, cannot fully observe commandments, including circumcision, and are therefore &#x27;sinners&#x27;, excluded from God&#x27;s covenant. Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection solved this problem of the exclusion of the Gentiles from God&#x27;s covenant, as indicated by Romans 3:21–26.

According to E.P. Sanders, who initiated the New Perspective on Paul, Paul saw the faithful redeemed by participation in Jesus&#x27; death and rising. But &quot;Jesus&#x27; death substituted for that of others and thereby freed believers from sin and guilt,&quot; a metaphor derived from &quot;ancient sacrificial theology,&quot; the essence of Paul&#x27;s writing is not in the &quot;legal terms&quot; regarding the expiation of sin, but the act of &quot;participation in Christ through dying and rising with him.&quot; According to Sanders, &quot;those who are baptized into Christ are baptized into his death, and thus they escape the power of sin [...] he died so that the believers may die with him and consequently live with him.&quot; James F. McGrath notes that Paul &quot;prefers to use the language of participation. One died for all, so that all died (2 Corinthians 5:14). This is not only different from substitution, it is the opposite of it.&quot; By this participation in Christ&#x27;s death and rising, &quot;one receives forgiveness for past offences, is liberated from the powers of sin, and receives the Spirit.&quot; Paul insists that salvation is received by the grace of God; according to Sanders, this insistence is in line with Judaism of until 200 CE, which saw God&#x27;s covenant with Israel as an act of grace of God. Observance of the Law is needed to maintain the covenant, but the covenant is not earned by observing the Law, but by the grace of God.

Several passages from Paul, such as Romans 3:25, are traditionally interpreted as meaning that humanity is saved by faith Christ. According to Richard B. Hays, who initiated the &quot;&quot;Pistis Christou&quot; debate,&quot; a different reading of these passages is also possible. The phrase can be translated as &#x27;faith in Christ&#x27;, that is, salvation by believing in Christ, the traditional interpretation; or as &#x27;faithfulness of Christ&#x27;, that is, belief &quot;through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ.&quot; In this view, according to Cobb, Jesus&#x27; life and death was not seen by Paul as an atonement, but as a means to participate in faithfulness. In this interpretation, Romans 3:21–26 states that Jesus was faithful, even to the cost of death, and justified by God for this faithfulness. Those who participate in this faithfulness are equally justified by God, both Jews and Gentiles. While this view has found support by a range of scholars, it has also been questioned and criticized.

====Gospels====
In the Gospels, Jesus is portrayed as calling for repentance from sin, and saying that God wants mercy rather than sacrifices (Matthew 9:13). Yet, he is also portrayed as &quot;giving His life [as] a ransom for many&quot; and applying the &quot;suffering servant&quot; passage of Isaiah 53 to himself (Luke 22:37). The Gospel of John portrays him as the sacrificial Lamb of God, and compares his death to the sacrifice of the Passover Lamb at Pesach.

Christians assert that Jesus was predicted by Isaiah, as attested in Luke 4:16–22, where Jesus is portrayed as saying that the prophecies in Isaiah were about him. The New Testament explicitly quotes from Isaiah 53 in Matthew 8:16–18 to indicate that Jesus is the fulfillment of these prophecies.

===Classic paradigm===
The classic paradigm entails the traditional understandings of the early Church Fathers, who developed the themes found in the New Testament.

====Ransom from Satan====
The ransom theory of atonement says that Christ liberated humanity from slavery to sin and Satan, and thus death, by giving his own life as a ransom sacrifice to Satan, swapping the life of the perfect (Jesus), for the lives of the imperfect (other humans). It entails the idea that God deceived the devil, and that Satan, or death, had &quot;legitimate rights&quot; over sinful souls in the afterlife, due to the fall of man and inherited sin. During the first millennium CE, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor for atonement, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselm&#x27;s satisfaction theory of atonement.

In one version of the idea of deception, Satan attempted to take Jesus&#x27; soul after he had died, but in doing so over-extended his authority, as Jesus had never sinned. As a consequence, Satan lost his authority completely, and all humanity gained freedom. In another version, God entered into a deal with Satan, offering to trade Jesus&#x27; soul in exchange for the souls of all people, but after the trade, God raised Jesus from the dead and left Satan with nothing. Other versions held that Jesus&#x27; divinity was masked by his human form, so Satan tried to take Jesus&#x27; soul without realizing that his divinity would destroy Satan&#x27;s power. Another idea is that Jesus came to teach how not to sin and Satan, in anger with this, tried to take his soul.

The ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by Irenaeus (), who was an outspoken critic of Gnosticism, but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview. In this worldview, mankind is under the power of the Demiurge, a lesser god who created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by gnosis (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the Logos, &quot;the very mind of the supreme God,&quot; who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurge, and had to hide his real identity, appearing in a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurge, and liberating mankind. In Irenaeus&#x27; writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil.

Origen (184–253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ. He also introduced the notion that the Devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.

Gustaf Aulén reinterpreted the ransom theory in his study (1931), calling it the Christus Victor doctrine, arguing that Christ&#x27;s death was not a payment to the Devil, but defeated the powers of evil, particularly Satan, which had held mankind in their dominion. According to Pugh, &quot;Ever since [Aulén&#x27;s] time, we call these patristic ideas the way of seeing the cross.&quot;

====Recapitulation theory====
The recapitulation view, first comprehensively expressed by Irenaeus, went &quot;hand-in-hand&quot; with the ransom theory. It says that Christ succeeds where Adam failed, undoing the wrong that Adam did and, because of his union with humanity, leads humanity on to eternal life, including moral perfection. Theosis (&quot;divinisation&quot;) is a &quot;corollary&quot; of the recapitulation.

===Objective paradigm===

====Satisfaction====
In the 11th century, Anselm of Canterbury rejected the ransom view and proposed the satisfaction theory of atonement. He allegedly depicted God as a feudal lord whose honor had been offended by the sins of mankind. In this view, people needed salvation from the divine punishment that these offences would bring, since nothing they could do could repay the honor debt. Anselm held that Christ had infinitely honored God through his life and death and that Christ could repay what humanity owed God, thus satisfying the offence to God&#x27;s honor and doing away with the need for punishment. When Anselm proposed the satisfaction view, it was immediately criticized by Peter Abelard.

====Penal substitution====
In the 16th century, the Protestant Reformers reinterpreted Anselm&#x27;s satisfaction theory of salvation within a legal paradigm. In the legal system, offences required punishment, and no satisfaction could be given to avert this need. They proposed a theory known as penal substitution, in which Christ takes the penalty of people&#x27;s sin as their substitute, thus saving people from God&#x27;s wrath against sin. Penal substitution thus presents Jesus saving people from the divine punishment of their past wrongdoings. However, this salvation is not presented as automatic. Rather, a person must have faith in order to receive this free gift of salvation. In the penal substitution view, salvation is not dependent upon human effort or deeds.

The penal substitution paradigm of salvation is widely held among Protestants, who often consider it central to Christianity. However, it has also been widely critiqued, and is rejected by liberal Christians as un-Biblical, and an offense to the love of God. According to Richard Rohr, &quot;[t]hese theories are based on &quot;retributive&quot; justice rather than the &quot;restorative&quot; justice that the prophets and Jesus taught.&quot; Advocates of the New Perspective on Paul also argue that many New Testament epistles of Paul the Apostle, which used to support the theory of penal substitution, should be interpreted differently.

====Governmental theory====

The &quot;governmental theory of atonement&quot; teaches that Christ suffered for humanity so that God could forgive humans without punishing them while still maintaining divine justice. It is traditionally taught in Arminian circles that draw primarily from the works of Hugo Grotius.

===Subjective paradigm===

====Moral transformation====
The &quot;moral influence theory of atonement&quot; was developed, or most notably propagated, by Abelard (1079–1142), as an alternative to Anselm&#x27;s satisfaction theory. Abelard not only &quot;rejected the idea of Jesus&#x27; death as a ransom paid to the devil&quot;, which turned the Devil into a rival god, but also objected to the idea that Jesus&#x27; death was a &quot;debt paid to God&#x27;s honor&quot;. He also objected to the emphasis on God&#x27;s judgment, and the idea that God changed his mind after the sinner accepted Jesus&#x27; sacrificial death, which was not easily reconcilable with the idea of &quot;the perfect, impassible God [who] does not change&quot;. Abelard focused on changing man&#x27;s perception of God – not to be seen as offended, harsh, and judgemental, but as loving. According to Abelard, &quot;Jesus died as the demonstration of God&#x27;s love&quot;, a demonstration which can change the hearts and minds of the sinners, turning back to God.

During the Protestant Reformation in Western Christianity, the majority of the Reformers strongly rejected the moral influence view of the atonement in favor of penal substitution, a highly forensic modification of the honor-oriented Anselmian satisfaction model. Fausto Sozzini&#x27;s Socinian arm of the Reformation maintained a belief in the moral influence view of the atonement. Socinianism was an early form of Unitarianism, and the Unitarian Church today maintains a moral influence view of the atonement, as do many liberal Protestant theologians of the modern age.

During the 18th century, versions of the moral influence view found overwhelming support among German theologians, most notably the Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant. In the 19th and 20th century, it has been popular among liberal Protestant thinkers in the Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran, and Presbyterian churches, including the Anglican theologian Hastings Rashdall. A number of English theological works in the last hundred years have advocated and popularized the moral influence theory of atonement.

A strong division has remained since the Reformation between liberal Protestants (who typically adopt a moral influence view) and conservative Protestants (who typically adopt a penal substitutionary view). Both sides believe that their position is taught by the Bible.

====Moral example theory====
A related theory, the &quot;moral example theory&quot;, was developed by Faustus Socinus (1539–1604) in his work (1578). He rejected the idea of &quot;vicarious satisfaction&quot;. According to Socinus, Jesus&#x27; death offers us a perfect example of self-sacrificial dedication to God.&quot;

A number of theologians see &quot;example&quot; (or &quot;exemplar&quot;) theories of the atonement as variations of the moral influence theory. Wayne Grudem, however, argues that &quot;Whereas the moral influence theory says that Christ&#x27;s death teaches us how much God loves us, the example theory says that Christ&#x27;s death teaches us how we should live.&quot; Grudem identifies the Socinians as supporters of the example theory.

===Other theories===
====Embracement theory====

Hong Kong Baptist University Department of Religion and Philosophy lecturer Domenic Marbaniang, drawing on Friedrich Nietzsche, sees the Divine voluntary self-giving as the ultimate embracement of humanity in its ultimate act of sin, viz, deicide, or the murder of God, thus canceling sin on the cross.

====Shared atonement theory====
Southern Baptist theologian David Jeremiah writes that in the &quot;shared atonement&quot; theory the atonement is spoken of as shared by all. To wit, God sustains the Universe. Therefore, if Jesus was God in human form, when he died, the entirety of humanity died with him, and when he rose from the dead, the entirety of humanity rose with him.

===Compatibility of differing theories===
Some theologians maintain that &quot;various biblical understandings of the atonement need not conflict&quot;. Reformed theologian J. I. Packer, for example, although he maintains that &quot;penal substitution is the mainstream, historic view of the church and the essential meaning of the Atonement... Yet with penal substitution at the center&quot;, he also maintains that &quot; and other Scriptural views of atonement can work together to present a fully orbed picture of Christ&#x27;s work&quot;. J. Kenneth Grider, speaking from a governmental theory perspective, says that the governmental theory can incorporate within itself &quot;numerous understandings promoted in the other major Atonement theories&quot;, including ransom theory, elements of the &quot;Abelardian &#x27;moral influence&#x27; theory&quot;, vicarious aspects of the atonement, etc.

Anglican theologian Oliver Chase Quick described differing theories as being of value, but also denied that any particular theory was fully true, saying, &quot;if we start from the fundamental and cardinal thought of God&#x27;s act of love in Jesus Christ [...] I think we can reach a reconciling point of view, from which each type of theory is seen to make its essential contribution to the truth, although no one theory, no any number of theories, can be sufficient to express its fullness.&quot;

Others say that some models of the atonement naturally exclude each other. James F. McGrath, for example, talking about the atonement, says that &quot;Paul [...] prefers to use the language of participation. One died for all, so that all died (2 Corinthians 5:14). This is not only different from substitution, it is the opposite of it.&quot; Similarly, Mark M. Mattison, in his article &quot;The Meaning of the Atonement&quot; says, &quot;Substitution implies an &quot;either/or&quot;; participation implies a &quot;both/and.&quot;&quot; J. Kenneth Grider, quoted above showing the compatibility of various atonement models with the governmental theory, nevertheless also says that both penal substitution and satisfaction atonement theories are incompatible with the governmental theory.

===Confusion of terms===
Some confusion can occur when discussing the atonement because the terms used sometimes have differing meanings depending on the contexts in which they are used. For example:
* Sometimes substitutionary atonement is used to refer to penal substitution alone, when the term also has a broader sense including other atonement models that are not penal.
* Penal substitution is also sometimes described as a type of satisfaction atonement, but the term &#x27;satisfaction atonement&#x27; functions primarily as a technical term to refer particularly to Anselm&#x27;s theory.
* Substitutionary and penal themes are found within the Patristic (and later) literature, but they are not used in a penal substitutionary sense until the Reformed period.
* &#x27;Substitution&#x27;, as well as potentially referring to specific theories of the atonement (e.g. penal substitution), is also sometimes used in a less technical way—for example, when used in &#x27;the sense that [Jesus, through his death,] did for us that which we can never do for ourselves&#x27;.
* The phrase &#x27;vicarious atonement&#x27; is sometimes used as a synonym for penal substitution, and is also sometimes used to describe other, non-penal substitutionary, theories of atonement. Care needs to be taken to understand what is being referred to by the various terms used in different contexts.

==Eastern Christianity==
According to Eastern Christian theology, based upon their understanding of the atonement as put forward by Irenaeus recapitulation theory, Jesus&#x27; death is a ransom. This restores the relation with God, who is loving and reaches out to humanity, and offers the possibility of &quot;theosis&quot; or divinization, becoming the kind of humans God wants us to be.

In Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism salvation is seen as participation in the renewal of human nature itself by way of the eternal Word of God assuming the human nature in its fullness. In contrast to Western branches of theology, Eastern Orthodox Christians tend to use the word &quot;expiation&quot; with regard to what is accomplished in the sacrificial act. In Orthodox theology, expiation is an act of offering that seeks to change the one making the offering. The Biblical Greek word which is translated both as &quot;propitiation&quot; and as &quot;expiation&quot; is &quot;hilasmos&quot; (I John 2:2, 4:10), which means &quot;to make acceptable and enable one to draw close to God&quot;. Thus the Orthodox emphasis would be that Christ died, not to appease an angry and vindictive Father or to avert the wrath of God upon sinners, but to defeat and secure the destruction of sin and death, so that those who are fallen and in spiritual bondage may become divinely transfigured, and therefore fully human, as their Creator intended; that is to say, human creatures become God in his energies or operations but not in his essence or identity, conforming to the image of Christ and reacquiring the divine likeness (see &quot;theosis&quot;).

The Orthodox Church further teaches that a person abides in Christ and makes his salvation sure not only by works of love, but also by his patient suffering of various griefs, illnesses, misfortunes and failures.

==Catholicism==

The Catholic Church teaches that the death of Jesus on the Cross is a sacrifice that redeems man and reconciles man to God. The sacrifice of Jesus is both a &quot;gift from God the Father himself, for the Father handed his Son over to sinners in order to reconcile us with himself&quot; and &quot;the offering of the Son of God made man, who in freedom and love offered his life to his Father through the Holy Spirit in reparation for our disobedience.&quot;

Catholic theologians often explain salvation by dividing it into justification—which relates to infused faith and how justice is satisfied—and sanctification—which relates to infused charity and our capacity for happiness at the beatific vision, some emphasizing their intertwinedness more than others. Catholic theology also affirms that salvation is communal: the salvation of any one individual is &quot;inseparable from the salvation of others&quot;.

A separate usage is &quot;salvation from Purgatory&quot; (i.e., related to sanctification) rather than salvation from sin and punishment (i.e., related to justification): this usage is rarer but examples are found by Catholics, Protestants, and academics.

===Tridentine definition===
The Catholic view of Christ&#x27;s redemptive work was set forth formally at the Sixth Session of the Council of Trent. The council stated that Jesus merited the grace of justification, which is not only the remission of sin but the infusion of the virtues of faith, hope, and charity into the Christian. A justified Christian is then said to be in the state of grace, which state can be lost by committing a mortal sin, entering a state of sin. 

The view which prevailed at the Council of Trent has been described as a &quot;combination of the opinions of Anselm and Abelard&quot;. Catholic scholars have noted that Abelard did not teach that Jesus was merely a good moral example, but that Christians are truly saved by His sacrifice on the Cross. 

The moral transformation of the Christian is not the result of merely following Christ&#x27;s example and teachings, but a supernatural gift merited by the sacrifice of Jesus, for &quot;by one man&#x27;s obedience many will be made righteous&quot;.

===Co-operation with grace===
While the initial grace of justification is merited solely by the sacrifice of Jesus, the Catholic Church teaches that a justified Christian can merit an &quot;increase&quot; in justification and the attainment of eternal life by cooperating with God&#x27;s grace. The grace of final perseverance preserves a justified Christian in the state of grace until his or her death.

The practical manner of salvation is expounded on by St. Alphonsus Liguori, a Doctor of the Church:

===Divinization===
The Catholic Church shares the Eastern Christian belief in divinization, teaching that &quot;the Son of God became man so that we might become God.&quot; However, in contrast with the Eastern Orthodox notion of theosis in which the divinized Christian becomes God in his energies or operations, the Catholic Church teaches that the ultimate end of divinization is the beatific vision, in which the divinized Christian will see God&#x27;s essence.

===Fate of the dead===
The Catholic Church does not believe in Christian universalism (i.e., all or most people go to heaven), in double predestination (i.e., some, most, or all people are destined to sin and hell), in Feeneyism (i.e., non-Catholics and excommunicated Catholics cannot be saved), or in how many people will go to heaven or hell (either most or few or some people). But the church does say that dying in the state of final impenitence - which is the mortal sin of refusing to repent of sin (even a venial sin) at the moment of death, the consequence of which is eternal punishment - leads to hell. The church also says that dying in the state of perfection (being without sin and punishment) leads to heaven, while dying in the state of either original sin (which is not a sin but the lack of sanctifying grace) or repentant sin (whether mortal or venial sin) lead to purgatory - unless the unbaptized sinful soul receives baptism or the baptized sinful soul receives anointing of the sick and the Apostolic Pardon, in which case, the soul goes to heaven. 

===Fate of the Universe===
Salvation in Catholic theology is intended for the whole of creation, not just for angels and people. The Universe&#x27;s salvation - i.e., being freed from evil and filled with all good things - will come at the end of time, as the Universe is unconditionally predestined for deification at the Last Judgment. Only humans and angels&#x27; predestination for deification is conditioned, and that on moral behavior, because of their freewill. By deification, all of creation (save for the demons and the damned) will be perfect and happy beyond comprehension because everything will share in God&#x27;s own perfection and happiness. This deification cannot be obtained, experienced, or foretasted before the Last Judgment because there is nothing in the Universe that is infinitely and supernaturally perfect and happy - only finitely and naturally perfect or happy. Nonetheless, baptism grants a foretaste of eternal life, which is the beginning of deification and a pledge of the Universe&#x27;s future salvation, via sanctifying grace. Eternal life in heaven entails the deification of the soul and, via the universal resurrection at the Last Judgment, the deified soul will be permanently reunited with its body, which itself will be deified. While the deified soul in heaven experiences the beatific vision with its whole self (personality, imagination, intellect, will, conscience, reason, virtue, self-image, relationship with others, etc.), the deified body will also experience the beatific vision with its whole self (all five senses, life, activity, presence, movement, appearance, talents, attire, needs, etc.), so that the whole person - body and soul - will be saved, i.e., deified and experience the beatific vision. As part of its deification, the deified body will be like Jesus&#x27; own deified resurrected body, which means being endowed with impassibility (immunity to evil, including temptation, sin, demons, inconvenience, error, boredom, fear, suffering, and death), subtility (freedom from the restraint of spacetime, meaning the saint can shapeshift, time travel, control nature, teleport, and have superhuman senses and prowess), agility (obedience to the soul, just as the soul is obedient to God), and clarity (resplendent beauty and the five crowns). With the Last Judgment, the demons will no longer be allowed to act outside of hell (such as temptation and possession), the Universe will be made immune to evil, evil will no longer be possible, and the Universe will be infinitely greater than the most idyllic paradise conceivable.

==Protestantism==
In Protestantism, grace is the result of God&#x27;s initiative without any regard whatsoever to the one initiating the works, and no one can merit the grace of God by performing rituals, good works, asceticism, or meditation. Broadly speaking, Protestants hold to the five &quot;solae&quot; of the Reformation, which declare that salvation is attained by &quot;grace alone&quot; in &quot;Christ alone&quot; through &quot;faith alone&quot; for the &quot;Glory of God alone&quot; as told in &quot;Scripture alone&quot;. Most Protestants believe that salvation is achieved through God&#x27;s grace alone, and once salvation is secured in the person, good works will be a result of this, allowing good works to often operate as a signifier for salvation. Some Protestants, such as Lutherans and the Reformed, understand this to mean that God saves solely by grace, and that works follow as a necessary consequence of saving grace. Others, such as Methodists (and other Arminians), believe that salvation is by faith alone, but that salvation can be forfeited if it is not accompanied by continued faith, and the works that naturally follow from it. Others firmly believe that salvation is accomplished by faith alone without any reference to works whatsoever, including the works that may follow salvation (see below under Other and also Free Grace theology).

===Lutheranism===
Lutherans believe that Christ, through His death and resurrection, has obtained justification and atonement for all sinners. Lutheran churches believe that this is the central message in the Bible upon which the very existence of the churches depends. In Lutheranism, it is a message relevant to people of all races and social levels, of all times and places, for &quot;the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men&quot; (Romans 5:18). All need forgiveness of sins before God, and Scripture proclaims that all have been justified, for &quot;the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men&quot; (Romans 5:18).

Lutheranism teaches that individuals receive this free gift of forgiveness and salvation not on the basis of their own works, but only through faith (&quot;Sola fide&quot;):
Saving faith is the knowledge of, acceptance of, and trust in the promise of the Gospel. Even faith itself is seen as a gift of God, created in the hearts of Christians by the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word and Baptism. Faith is seen as an instrument that receives the gift of salvation, not something that causes salvation. Thus, Lutherans reject the &quot;decision theology&quot; which is common among modern evangelicals.

===Calvinism===
Calvinists believe in the predestination of the elect before the foundation of the world. All of the elect necessarily persevere in faith because God keeps them from falling away. Calvinists understand the doctrines of salvation to include the five points of Calvinism, typically arranged in English to form the acrostic &quot;TULIP&quot;.

* &quot;Total depravity&quot;, also called &quot;total inability&quot;, asserts that as a consequence of the fall of man into sin, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of sin. People are not by nature inclined to love God with their whole heart, mind, or strength, but rather all are inclined to serve their own interests over those of their neighbor and to reject the rule of God. Thus, all people by their own faculties are morally unable to choose to follow God and be saved because they are unwilling to do so out of the necessity of their own natures. (The term &quot;total&quot; in this context refers to sin affecting every part of a person, not that every person is as evil as possible.) This doctrine is derived from Augustine&#x27;s explanation of Original Sin.
* &quot;Unconditional election&quot; asserts that God has chosen from eternity those whom he will bring to himself not based on foreseen virtue, merit, or faith in those people; rather, it is unconditionally grounded in God&#x27;s mercy alone. God has chosen from eternity to extend mercy to those he has chosen and to withhold mercy from those not chosen. Those chosen receive salvation through Christ alone. Those not chosen receive the just wrath that is warranted for their sins against God
* &quot;Limited atonement&quot;, also called &quot;particular redemption&quot; or &quot;definite atonement&quot;, asserts that Jesus&#x27;s substitutionary atonement was definite and certain in its purpose and in what it accomplished. This implies that only the sins of the elect were atoned for by Jesus&#x27;s death. Calvinists do not believe, however, that the atonement is limited in its value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited in the sense that it is designed for some and not all. Hence, Calvinists hold that the atonement is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect. The doctrine is driven by the Calvinistic concept of the sovereignty of God in salvation and their understanding of the nature of the atonement.
* &quot;Irresistible grace&quot;, also called &quot;efficacious grace&quot;, asserts that the saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has determined to save (that is, the elect) and, in God&#x27;s timing, overcomes their resistance to obeying the call of the gospel, bringing them to a saving faith. This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God&#x27;s Holy Spirit cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, &quot;graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ.&quot;
* &quot;Perseverance of the saints&quot;, or &quot;preservation of the saints&quot;, asserts that since God is sovereign and his will cannot be frustrated by humans or anything else, those whom God has called into communion with himself will continue in faith until the end. Those who apparently fall away either never had true faith to begin with or will return. The word &quot;saints&quot; is used to refer to all who are set apart by God, and not only those who are exceptionally holy, canonized, or in heaven).

===Arminianism===
Arminian soteriology—held by Christian denominations such as the Methodist Church—is based on the theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609). Like Calvinists, Arminians agree that all people are born sinful and are in need of salvation. Classical Arminians emphasize that God&#x27;s free grace (or prevenient grace) enables humans to freely respond to or to reject the salvation offered through Christ. Classical Arminians believe that a person&#x27;s saving relationship with Christ is conditional upon faith, and thus, a person can sever his or her saving relationship with Christ through persistent unbelief. The relationship of &quot;the believer to Christ is never a static relationship existing as the irrevocable consequence of a past decision, act, or experience.&quot;

The Five Articles of Remonstrance that Arminius&#x27;s followers formulated in 1610 state the beliefs regarding (I) conditional election, (II) unlimited atonement, (III) total depravity, (IV) total depravity and resistible grace, and (V) possibility of apostasy. However, the fifth article did not completely deny the perseverance of the saints; Arminius said that &quot;I never taught that a true believer can… fall away from the faith… yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of Scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such a kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding.&quot; Further, the text of the Articles of Remonstrance says that no believer can be plucked from Christ&#x27;s hand, and the matter of falling away, &quot;loss of salvation&quot;, required further study before it could be taught with any certainty.

====Methodism====

Methodism falls squarely in the tradition of substitutionary atonement, though it is linked with Christus Victor and moral influence theories. Methodism also emphasizes a participatory nature in atonement, in which the Methodist believer spiritually dies with Christ as He dies for humanity.

Methodism affirms the doctrine of justification by faith, but in Wesleyan theology, justification refers to &quot;pardon, the forgiveness of sins&quot;, rather than &quot;being made actually just and righteous&quot;, which Methodists believe is accomplished through sanctification. John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Churches, taught that the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, as well as engaging in the works of piety and the works of mercy, were &quot;indispensable for our sanctification&quot;.

Methodist soteriology emphasizes the importance of the pursuit of holiness in salvation, a concept best summarized in a quote by Methodist evangelist Phoebe Palmer who stated that &quot;justification would have ended with me had I refused to be holy.&quot; Thus, for Methodists, &quot;true faith...&quot;cannot&quot; subsist without works&quot;.

While &quot;faith is essential for a meaningful relationship with God, our relationship with God also takes shape through our care for people, the community, and creation itself.&quot; Methodism, inclusive of the holiness movement, thus teaches that &quot;justification [is made] conditional on obedience and progress in sanctification&quot;, emphasizing &quot;a deep reliance upon Christ not only in coming to faith, but in remaining in the faith.&quot;

=== Free Grace Theology ===
There are some who believe in the Free Grace Theology. They believe people use their free will to receive imputed righteousness and eternal life in Heaven, simply by Grace through faith alone on The Lord Jesus Christ. Once saved, the individual will always be saved as they believe God promised them eternal life the moment they believe on Him. It&#x27;s important to note they don&#x27;t believe a person is saved by good works, neither do they teach good works would automatically follow salvation as any kind of evidence. After salvation, a Christian is instructed to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to the lost and live a good life as a good testimony for Jesus Christ and to please God the Father. The belief here is that doing good works will earn a believer Heavenly treasures and Earthly blessings, whereas committing sins and bad works will cause earthly punishments from God, chastisement from a loving Father, towards his children in the faith. It&#x27;s worth a note they believe a person cannot lose their salvation at any time.

===Anabaptism===
Anabaptist denominations such as the Mennonites teach:

Obedience to Jesus and a careful keeping of the Ten Commandments, in addition to loving one another and being at peace with others, are seen as &quot;earmarks of the saved&quot;.

===Universalism===
Christian universalism is the doctrine or belief that all people will ultimately be reconciled to God. The appeal of the idea of universal salvation may be related to the perception of a problem of Hell, standing opposed to ideas such as endless conscious torment in Hell, but may also include a period of finite punishment similar to a state of purgatory. Believers in universal reconciliation may support the view that while there may be a real &quot;Hell&quot; of some kind, it is neither a place of endless suffering nor a place where the spirits of human beings are ultimately &#x27;annihilated&#x27; after enduring the just amount of divine retribution.

===Restorationism===

====Churches of Christ====

Churches of Christ are strongly anti-Calvinist in their understanding of salvation, and generally present conversion as &quot;obedience to the proclaimed facts of the gospel rather than as the result of an emotional, Spirit-initiated conversion.&quot; Some churches of Christ hold the view that humans of accountable age are lost because of their sins. These lost souls can be redeemed because Jesus Christ, the Son of God, offered himself as the atoning sacrifice. Children too young to understand right from wrong, and make a conscious choice between the two, are believed to be innocent of sin. The age when this occurs is generally believed to be around 13.

Beginning in the 1960s, many preachers began placing more emphasis on the role of grace in salvation, instead of focusing exclusively implementing all of the New Testament commands and examples.

The Churches of Christ argue that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual. One author describes the relationship between faith and baptism this way, &quot;&quot;Faith&quot; is the &quot;reason why&quot; a person is a child of God; &quot;baptism&quot; is the &quot;time at which&quot; one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God&quot; (italics are in the source). Baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance, rather than a &quot;work&quot; that earns salvation.

==Other==

===The New Church (Swedenborgian)===
According to the doctrine of The New Church, as explained by Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), there is no such thing as substitutionary atonement as is generally understood. Swedenborg&#x27;s account of atonement has much in common with the Christus Victor doctrine, which refers to a Christian understanding of the Atonement which views Christ&#x27;s death as the means by which the powers of evil, which held humanity under their dominion, were defeated. It is a model of the atonement that is dated to the Church Fathers, and it, along with the related ransom theory, was the dominant theory of the atonement for a thousand years.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===

According to Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, atonement for sins comes only through the life, ministry, and death of Jesus Christ. They believe Jesus was the &quot;second Adam&quot;, being the pre-existent and sinless Son of God who became the human Messiah of Israel, and that he came to undo Adamic sin.

Witnesses believe that the sentence of death given to Adam and subsequently his offspring by God required an equal substitute or ransom sacrifice of a perfect man. They believe that salvation is possible only through Jesus&#x27; ransom sacrifice, and that individuals cannot be reconciled to God until they repent of their sins, and then call on the name of God through Jesus. Salvation is described as a free gift from God, but is said to be unattainable without obedience to Christ as King and good works, such as baptism, confession of sins, evangelizing, and promoting God&#x27;s Kingdom, that are prompted by faith. According to their teaching, the works prove faith is genuine. &quot;Preaching the good news&quot; is said to be one of the works necessary for salvation, both of those who preach and those to whom they preach. They believe that people in the &quot;last days&quot; can be &quot;saved&quot; by identifying Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses as God&#x27;s theocratic organization, and by serving God as a part of it.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that the atonement of Jesus Christ is infinite and the central principle that enables the &quot;plan of redemption&quot; which is often also called the &quot;plan of salvation&quot;. In the Book of Mormon the prophet Amulek teaches that the &quot;great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal. And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name&quot; There are two parts of salvation, conditional and unconditional. Unconditional salvation means that the atonement of Jesus Christ redeems all humanity from the chains of death and they are resurrected to their perfect frames. Conditional salvation of the righteous comes by grace coupled with strict obedience to Gospel principles, in which those who have upheld the highest standards and are committed to the covenants and ordinances of God, will inherit the highest heaven. There is no need for infant baptism. Christ&#x27;s atonement completely resolved the consequence from the fall of Adam of spiritual death for infants, young children and those of innocent mental capacity who die before an age of self-accountability, hence all these are resurrected to eternal life in the resurrection. However, baptism is required of those who are deemed by God to be accountable for their actions (Moroni 8:10–22)

===Oneness Pentecostalism===
Oneness Pentecostals believe that salvation is attained through faith in Jesus Christ. According to their theology, this saving faith is more than just mental assent, intellectual acceptance, or verbal profession, but must include obedience, demonstrated by repentance, water baptism in Jesus&#x27; name, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues.

<text>The Norwegian Army () is the land warfare service branch of the Norwegian Armed Forces. The Army is the oldest of the Norwegian service branches, established as a modern military organization under the command of the King of Norway in 1628. The Army participated in various continental wars during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries as well, both in Norway and abroad, especially in World War II (1939–1945). It constitutes part of the Norwegian military contribution as a charter member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 1949.

== History ==
===Creation of the Norwegian Army===

After the Kalmar War broke out in 1611, the Danish-Norwegian king, Christian IV tried to revive the leidang, with dire results. As the Norwegian peasantry had not been armed or trained in the use of arms for nearly three centuries, they were not able to fight. The soldiers deserted or were captured. The soldiers had to participate in military drills while providing supplementary labor to the local community when not in active service. Although the army still did not represent the whole nation, as city residents were exempt from military duty, 1628 is generally regarded by historians as the year when the modern Norwegian army was born.

As a result of the Torstenson war (, , ) lasting from 1643 to 1645, Danish–Norwegian territories were to be ceded to Sweden. This led Christian IV to invite German mercenaries to coach and command the Danish–Norwegian armed forces: a decision echoing down the centuries in traces of German vocabulary used by the Norwegian military to this day.

In the early 18th century the Swedes invaded Norway again, and this time the Norwegian army held its own, setting the stage for nearly a century of peace – the longest yet in early modern and modern Norwegian history – during which time a distinct Norwegian identity began to evolve. German ceased to be the official language of command in the army in 1772, in favor of &quot;Dano-Norwegian&quot;.

=== Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars ===
During the French Revolutionary Wars, Denmark–Norway tried to remain neutral. But the British attack on Copenhagen 1801 forced the kingdom to leave the Second League of Armed Neutrality. The British bombardment of the Danish capital in 1807 pushed King Frederik IV to align with French Emperor Napoleon I. Hostilities reached north into Scandinavia and by 1807, Denmark-Norway was at war with Great Britain. Denmark–Norway&#x27;s alliance with France and Sweden&#x27;s partnership with Great Britain led to war with Sweden in 1808. Sweden bid to acquire Norway through invasion while Denmark-Norway made ill-fated attempts to reconquer territories lost to Sweden in the 17th century. As the Napoleonic era drew to a close, the anti-French victorious allies decided to sever Norway from Denmark and unite and award Norway to neighboring Sweden in 1814 at the Congress of Vienna.

The Royal Decree of 3 July 1817 decided that the Army should, among other things, consist of five infantry brigades. There were 1st Akershus, 2nd Akershus, 3rd Trondhjem, 4th Bergen, and 5th Kristiansand infantry brigades. The brigades had a section called the brigade command (5th Brig.kdo.), Which was responsible for the war organization and plans.

===Union with Sweden===
The union with Sweden lasted until which time the Norwegian Army retained a separate entity within the joint kingdoms. Financial budgeting, recruitment, regimental organization, and uniforms were all independent of their Swedish counterparts. The basis for recruitment for the Norwegian Army was initially one of conscription for up to five years by lot drawn amongst rural recruits only. A framework was provided by regular soldiers or &quot;served&quot;, enlisted as long-service volunteers. As with other armies of the period, the payment of a substitute to serve in one&#x27;s place was permitted. This system was replaced by one of universal conscription introduced in 1854. Enlistment in the active army was however still based on the drawing of ballots, with those escaping full-time service going immediately to the reserve &quot;landvern&quot;, where they received brief and basic training.

In 1884, the basis of service was further modified with the training period being reduced to 90 days. The regulars of the &quot;hvervede&quot; were reduced to a cadre of career officers, NCOs, and other specialists. The individual Norwegian recruit now passed through three stages of service with the line regiments, the militia, and the territorial reserve during the 13-year period that his liability for military service lasted. The left-wing parties of the Storting favored the substitution of part-time volunteer rifle clubs for the regular army but this was opposed by the Storting (Parliament of Norway) parliamentary majority on the basis of the doubtful effectiveness of such a force.

===Independence===
In June 1905, the Storting unilaterally dissolved the 91-year-old union with Sweden. After a short but tense period during which both armies were mobilized, Sweden agreed to the peaceful dissolution of the union. In 1911, six brigades were established, which by the Army Order of 1916 were called divisions. The divisions were consecutively numbered without geographical place names. The divisions corresponded to what later became district commands. 
By 1920, the army of Norway was a national militia. Service was universal and compulsory, liability commencing at the age of 18 and continuing till the age of 56. The men were called out at 21, and for the first 12 years belonged to the line; then for 12 years to the landvarn. Afterwards they passed into the landatorm, in which they remained until they attained the age of 55 years. The initial training was carried out in recruits&#x27; schools; it lasted for 48 days in the infantry and garrison artillery, 62 in the mountain batteries, 72 in the engineers, 92 in the field artillery, and 102 in the cavalry. As soon as their courses were finished the men were transferred to the units to which they would permanently belong, and with them went through a further training of 30 days. Subsequent training consisted of 80 days in the second, third and seventh years of service.

The line was organized into 6 divisions of all arms, besides which there was the garrison artillery. There were 56 battalions of infantry, 5 companies of cyclists (skiers), 3 regiments of cavalry (16 squadrons), 27 four-gun field batteries, 3 batteries of mountain artillery, 9 batteries of heavy artillery, and 1 regiment and 2 battalions of engineers. The new Flying Corps was organized in 3 divisions. The divisions were of unequal strength, according to the importance of the district in which they were recruited. In event of war, each division would mobilize 2 or 3 regiments of infantry (of 3 battalions), 3 or 4 squadrons of cavalry, a battalion of field artillery (of 3 batteries), a battalion of heavy artillery, a sapper company, a telegraph company, a medical company and a company of train. Each regimental district also forms one battalion of landvarn (of 6 companies), and the other arms would form landvarn units in the same proportion. The total peace strength was 118,500 men and comprised 71,836 rifles, 228 field and 36 heavy guns. The additional numbers available on mobilization amount to 282,000 men.

The Norwegian infantry was armed with various models of the Norwegian-designed Krag–Jørgensen 6.5x55 rifles and carbines. The field artillery had Ehrhardt 7.5 cm Model 1901. The budget of the army for 1919–1920 was 1,940,000.

The divisions received in 1933 the task of establishing their own field manoeuvre brigade with the same number as the division.

=== World War I ===
With full Norwegian independence, legislation was passed strengthening the system introduced in 1885. Liability for military service was extended to 55 years of age and the period of training was lengthened to about five months. Additional localized regiments were created within a framework of six military districts, permitting more rapid mobilization of reservists. These precautions proved effective in 1914 with the outbreak of World War I. Norway&#x27;s armed forces remained mobilized throughout the war, ensuring Norwegian neutrality in conjunction with that of Denmark and Sweden.

Though nominally a neutral nation during the &quot;Great War&quot; of World War I (1914–1918), Norway was in the unenviable position of being dependent on the warring sides for its trade. Coal from Britain was needed to keep the country going, and Norway had thus to agree that each shipload of coal leaving Britain be matched with incoming Norwegian cargoes such as copper ore and fish. This attracted the attention of the opposing German Empire and its Imperial German Navy&#x27;s numerous submarines.

In 1911 the 5th Brigade was established as the Norwegian Army&#x27;s district organization in Møre og Romsdal and Trøndelag. It was upgraded to the status of the 5th Division in 1916.
===World War II===
Despite the escalating hostilities throughout Europe in 1939 and 1940, the Norwegian government at the time failed to mobilize; leaving the Army wholly unprepared for the German invasion of April 1940. The Norwegians were organised into six divisions/districts in April 1940. This amounted to approximately 19,000 men on paper. This was actually a numerically superior force to that of the Germans. However, these divisions were ill-prepared by the time the landings commenced and four were destroyed by the Germans during the initial phases of the campaign. With the German occupational forces in 1940, as with the other parts of the Armed Forces, the Army had to surrender to a superior force, but army units were the ones resisting for the longest period of time: The 6th Division led by the legendary Major General Carl Gustav Fleischer participated in the allied recapture of Narvik.

In most divisions, A force of 3 regiments (With 3,750 men in each regiment, 11,250 men in total) was the basic organization of the army. But with the 3rd and 4th Division, There was only 2 regiments (7,500 total men). Total Norwegian Division Force numbered 60,000 Men, in 16 Regiments. There was also a Few Extra Groups, like 3 Dragoon Regiments, 3 Artillery Regiments, a few Mountain artillery battalions and infantry battalions in the far north, with 2 Royal Guards companies in the south.

The greatest Norwegian accomplishment of the Second World War was the victory in the Battle of Narvik, especially the mountain war forcing the German forces all the way from the ocean to the Swedish border. In addition to the Norwegian Campaign, Norwegian soldiers joined the Norwegian resistance movement after German forces occupied Norway. The Home Front (Hjemmefronten) was the Norwegian resistance movement during Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of Norway (1940–1945).

Norwegian soldiers also joined free Norwegian units in the United Kingdom to continue the fight against the Nazis from abroad. These units included the Norwegian Independent Company 1 and 5 Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando. The bulk of the Norwegian Army during the years in exile in Britain consisted of a brigade in Dumfries as well as smaller units stationed in Iceland, Jan Mayen, Svalbard and South Georgia. The 2nd Mountain Company operated in Finnmark from late 1944 under nominal Russian command. Norwegian police troops and units from this brigade took control over Finnmark in 1944 after the German retreat from the Red Army.

===Cold War===
The Army was reconstructed after the War, based among others on the forces Norwegian Brigade in Scotland and the Norwegian police troops in Sweden as well as on Milorg. The participation in the allied occupation of Germany with the Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany was a very demanding task for the Army in the period of 1946–52, but it was also a part of the reconstruction. After the war the Army was structured to meet an invasion from the East. The Army was established in all parts of the country, from 1972 in five regional &quot;divisions&quot; to commemorate the divisions/districts of the Second World War: East (including the inactive 6th Brigade), West, South, Trondelag, and 6th Division: North Norway. The first four divisions were divided into 12 regional districts, which could, after full mobilization, embody 11 combat brigades (10 mobilization-dependent). 6th Division controlled Brigade North in Tromsø, two brigade mobilization districts, and two garrisons in the northernmost Finnmark region. At the end of the Cold War the army could mobilise 13 brigades, although 10 of them were less well equipped.

===Post Cold War===

This picture definitely changed with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent break-up of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. 

It has been downsized after the end of the Cold War, with the biggest changes taking place in the middle of the 1990s, when a number of garrisons and units were discontinued. This restructuring focused on moving from a fairly static invasion army to a flexible rapid reaction army. The Parliament in 1994 and 1995 approved a series of major organizational changes, for the Army in particular. To ensure a cost-efficient implementation, it is necessary to focus the activities in the Army on the process of transforming the army from a large mobilization army to a smaller, professional army.

The 2005–08 plan envisaged reduction of the then army from three to two brigades, but the essential and key formation was to be Brigade North. The 6 Division Command was to be organised as a mobile tactical headquarters with the capability to serve as a framework for a headquarters for multinational operations above brigade level in Norway. But to keep Brigade North operational Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly was told in May 2004 would require two brigade sets of equipment. The Army had by the end of the decade been significantly downsized from its late Cold War heights, and has for example faced criticism from within claiming that it would now only be able to defend one district of Oslo in the event of a national invasion.
Norwegian contributions to international crisis management have been generated from a system that is first and foremost geared towards the rapid activation of mobilization units armed and trained for territorial defence. As a consequence, Norwegian contributions to international military operations have a high degree of sustainability, as they have a substantial number of reserve units on which to draw. However, without adaptation this force posture is to a lesser extent able to generate forces rapidly and flexibly in response to international crises. Moreover, the contributions that Norway has been able to make to international operations have tended to consist of lightly armoured mechanized infantry, well-suited for more traditional peacekeeping tasks (UNIFIL in southern Lebanon to which Norway contributed a sizable unit for over twenty years) but not sufficiently robust for missions which might entail enforcement tasks.

=== War in Afghanistan ===

Norway along with other Scandinavian countries, supported the US War on Terror. The Norwegian government was one of the strongest supporters of the war.

Norwegian Defence Minister at the time, Bjørn Tore Godal, said &quot;the United States is Norway&#x27;s most important ally. Norway is already providing intelligence assistance to the United States. If we receive a request for further support, including military support, we will, of course, respond positively, and in accordance with the obligations of article 5 of the NATO treaty.&quot;

The Norwegian Army sent troops to support the NATO ISAF mission in Afghanistan, to help free Afghanistan of the Taliban. Norwegian special forces were involved in combat operations during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2002, and Norwegian Army troops during Operation Harekate Yolo in 2007. About 590 Norwegians were serving in the ISAF force in 2009.

According to , the Norwegian Army base at Meymaneh was amongst the least secure bases in Afghanistan at one point. Meymaneh is located in northwestern Afghanistan, which has become increasingly restless in recent years. Both the military and political heads of the armed forces agreed about the weakened state of the base. When the Norwegian Army was asked what they needed to defend their position, they asked for 120 troops and long-range weapons. They also requested a mobile reaction force, so that allies in the region could assist each other if they came under heavy attack.

== Organization ==

In 2009 the Army introduced the new command and control lines. The Chief of the Army (former General Inspector) now commands three subordinate operational units and five support units:

* Army Staff, in Bardufoss
** Brigade Nord, in Bardufoss
** Hans Majestet Kongens Garde, in Oslo
** Finnmark Land Command
** Military intelligence Battalion, in Setermoen
** Land Warfare Centre, in Rena and Terningmoen
** Military police unit
** Operations Support Group, in Bardufoss (Maintenance, Catering, etc.)

=== Hans Majestets Kongens Garde (Garden) ===
Hans Majestet Kongens Garde is a light infantry battalion based in Oslo at Huseby camp. The main task of Garden is to protect the King and the royal family in peace, crisis and war.

After the terrorist attack in 2011, the unit also functions as a defence force in Norway’s capital Oslo and will assist the police when needed.

===Brigade Nord===
Brigade Nord is the Norwegian Army&#x27;s only major combat formation. Brigade Nord is the northernmost combat brigade in NATO and has the capabilities to plan, lead and implement operations with support from other branches of the Norwegian Defence Forces. The brigade is formed primarily around three all-arms battlegroups.

=== Finnmark Land Command ===
Further north, the Finnmark Land Command is in charge of safeguarding Norway&#x27;s northernmost land territories and the land border to Russia. It is a joint command, including an army staff and army and Home Guard units. In 2024, it was announced that the Finnmark Land Command organisation would be reinforced as part of the Norwegian government&#x27;s long-term plan, with the ultimate aim to have it formed as a full brigade. The intention is to have a light infantry battalion, artillery (with embedded anti-aircraft element), engineers and intelligence units based in the region by 2032.

* Finnmark Land Command (&quot;Finnmark Landforsvar&quot;), in Porsangmoen
** Porsanger Battalion (&quot;Porsanger Bataljon&quot;), cavalry battalion in Porsangmoen with a K9 Thunder battery 
** Ranger Battalion GSV (&quot;Jegerbataljonen GSV&quot;), infantry battalion in Høybuktmoen guarding the Norway–Russia border
** 17th Home Guard District Finnmark (&quot;Finnmark Heimevernsdistrikt 17&quot;), in Porsangermoen

===2012 White Paper===
According to the Norwegian MoD 2012 White Paper the Brigade Nord maneuver elements will be reorganised. Telemark Bataljonen and The Armoured Battalion will be organized as two near identical mechanized battalions composed mainly of contract personnel, but with some conscripts. The 2nd Battalion will be developed in the light infantry role, composed mainly of conscript personnel. The brigade will be equipped with organic air defence assets. The reorganization is intended to provide the brigade with 2 continuously combat ready battlegroups.

== Uniforms ==
Norwegian army field uniforms are mainly two different uniforms: M17, a lightweight field uniform for general use, both in garrison and in field. And M02: A field uniform with breathable membrane, which provides protection against moisture and wind. Service uniform M10 is used as ceremonial dress and service dress; blue full dress uniform as ceremonial dress and mess dress. Blue full dress uniforms are used by professional soldiers.

The goal of the Nordic Combat Uniform Project is to procure a common, flexible combat uniform system for the countries Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Although the uniform will be the same in the four Nordic countries, the uniforms will look different because the countries will use their own camouflage patterns.

<doc id="388137" wikidata="Q3264289" url="?curid=388137" title="Loveline">
<text>Loveline is a syndicated radio call-in program in North America, offering medical and relationship advice to listeners, often with the assistance of guests, typically actors and musicians. Its host through most of its run was Drew Pinsky who was paired with a radio personality.

&quot;Loveline&quot; was broadcast live, Sundays through Thursdays from 10p.m.–midnight PT (Mondays through Fridays from 1–3a.m. ET). Its flagship station was KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. Syndication was usually on rock, alternative, and adult talk radio stations. &quot;Loveline&quot; can also be heard online through the websites of affiliate stations.

The radio show was discontinued in April 2016. After a hiatus, the show was rebooted as a podcast with Amber Rose and clinical psychologist and sex therapist Chris Donaghue as hosts. The renewed podcast ran from September 8, 2016, until March 17, 2018.

On November 1, 2018, &quot;Loveline&quot; was revived on LGBTQ network Channel Q with Dr. Chris Donaghue as the solo host, heard Monday through Thursday from 7 to 9 p.m. Eastern Time. Channel Q is owned by Audacy, Inc. and heard on the company&#x27;s namesake streaming service and on the HD Radio subchannels of about 20 FM stations in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and other large media markets. Though no cancellation or hiatus was formally announced until the next version of the show launched in 2024, no new episodes of the show were released after December 2022.

A third incarnation of the show debuted on KROQ on December 15, 2024, hosted by KROQ personality Kevan Kenny and Tara Suwinyattichaiporn, who has a doctoral degree in human communication.

During its peak of popularity, &quot;Loveline&quot; also doubled as a weekly live audience television program on MTV, also called &quot;Loveline&quot;. It was presented by Pinsky, Adam Carolla and a third co-host.

== History ==

&quot;Loveline&quot; began in 1983 as a Sunday night dating and relationships segment on Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, hosted by DJ Jim &quot;Poorman&quot; Trenton, DJ &quot;Swedish&quot; Egil Aalvik, and Scott Mason.

In 1984, Trenton added a segment called &quot;Ask a Surgeon,&quot; hosted by his friend Drew Pinsky, who at the time, was a fourth-year medical student at the University of Southern California. The medical segment was pre-dated by an occasional legal segment in which a lawyer, known as &quot;Lawyer Lee&quot; would be present to answer legal questions. As &quot;Loveline&quot; developed and increased its audience, Pinsky became a public figure in his own right, and the show began referring to him informally as &quot;Dr. Drew&quot;.

After a traumatic break up, Mason announced that he would no longer be hosting the show. After they stopped doing the &quot;Lawyer Lee&quot; segment and &quot;Swedish&quot; Egil left the show, Trenton continued co-hosting the show with Dr. Drew. In February 1992, the show expanded from Sunday nights to five nights a week, Sunday through Thursday. In August 1993, Trenton was replaced by former MTV VJ Riki Rachtman.

Pinsky and Rachtman were joined by Adam Carolla in October 1995, as the show was first being syndicated nationally. The trio hosted together for several months, but Carolla and Rachtman often competed for airtime, leading Rachtman to resign in January 1996. Carolla and Pinsky would go on to host the show together until Carolla&#x27;s departure in November 2005.

The popularity and reach of &quot;Loveline&quot; increased dramatically in the ten years during which it was hosted by Pinsky and Carolla. The two had a natural chemistry, in which Carolla&#x27;s jocular tone emphasized Pinsky&#x27;s reasoned expertise. Together, they refined the format of the show, and capitalized on their growing popularity with speaking tours, a television show on MTV from 1996–2000 (also titled &quot;Loveline&quot;), a book, and cameo appearances on television series and movies. In November 2005, Carolla left &quot;Loveline&quot; to prepare for a new morning radio show, &quot;The Adam Carolla Show&quot;, which began airing in January 2006.

After Carolla&#x27;s departure, he was substituted on a temporary basis by numerous celebrity guests, some of whom announced their desire to take the job permanently. During his first appearance on Carolla&#x27;s new morning show, Pinsky revealed that the shortlist of candidates included Carson Daly, Joel McHale, Danny Bonaduce, Steve-O and Daniel Tosh. On July 23, 2006, KROQ-FM disc jockey Stryker was hired as Pinsky&#x27;s co-host.

On April 22, 2009, Stryker announced that due to financial cutbacks at Westwood One, he would be leaving the show and it would be his last appearance that night. After Stryker&#x27;s departure, a number of celebrities guest co-hosted opposite Drew. On March 11, 2010, it was announced that Mike &quot;Psycho Mike&quot; Catherwood from &quot;The Kevin and Bean Show&quot; would co-host &quot;Loveline&quot; with Dr. Drew.

After a long stint as a guest host, Simone Bienne was formally brought on as a co-host in December 2011. This followed Westwood One&#x27;s merger with Dial Global. She was introduced to the show by Dr. Drew through &quot;Lifechangers&quot;, and is the first female co-host of the radio show. As of November 2012 she is no longer a host.

On December 7, 2012, Adam Carolla rejoined Dr. Drew for a Loveline-style &quot;Reunion Tour&quot; of the US to promote their new podcast, &quot;The Adam &amp; Dr. Drew Show&quot;.

On January 5, 2015, Catherwood and Pinsky launched a new program, &quot;Dr. Drew Midday Live with Mike Catherwood&quot; on KABC in Los Angeles.

On March 16, 2016, Catherwood announced that he would be leaving the show to focus more on raising his daughter. His final episode was March 31, 2016. A month later, on April 21, Dr. Drew announced &quot;Loveline&quot; would wrap up the following week, after the April 28 episode. Adam Carolla re-joined him as co-host for the final show.

On September 8, 2016, the show was rebooted as a weekly podcast, with Amber Rose and Dr. Chris Donaghue serving as hosts. Ann Ingold was named producer. The final episode of the podcast was released on March 8, 2018.

On November 1, 2018, &quot;Loveline&quot; was once again rebooted, this time on LGBTQ+ formatted talk radio network Channel Q. It is hosted by Dr. Chris Donaghue, and airs Monday through Thursday from 7 to 9PM (Pacific). The Channel Q version of the show ceased releasing new episodes in December 2022 with no fanfare.

A third incarnation of the show debuted on December 15, 2024, hosted by KROQ personality Kevan Kenney and Tara Suwinyattichaiporn, who is not a medical doctor but has a PhD in human communication. The announcement of the new show confirmed that the Channel Q show had &quot;ended&quot; in 2022.

== Format ==
&quot;Loveline&quot; follows the call-in question-and-answer model with the primary goal of helping youth and young adults with relationship, sexuality, and drug addiction problems through the expertise of Pinsky, an internist and addiction medicine specialist, and the humorous context and insight provided by a comedic host. Adam Carolla explained his role as a &quot;sheep in wolf&#x27;s clothing&quot;. Furthermore, the comedy is often necessary to keep spirits high, as the show frequently handles callers who are dealing with serious issues such as drug addiction, sexual abuse, and domestic violence.

The show will occasionally answer calls of a general medical nature, especially on slow nights or if they seem peculiar. Also, listeners are encouraged to participate in Loveline&#x27;s many games.

;Timeline


== Media tie-ins and cultural influence ==
A TV version of &quot;Loveline&quot;, also called &quot;Loveline&quot;, ran on MTV from 1996 to 2000; it was produced by Stone Stanley Entertainment. It followed the same general format as the radio program but featured a live audience and a female co-host alongside Pinsky and Carolla. The female co-host role was filled over the course of the series by MTV VJ Idalis, actresses Kris McGaha, Catherine McCord, Diane Farr and comedian Laura Kightlinger. &quot;Loveline TV&quot; was filmed at Hollywood Center Studios.

&quot;The Dr. Drew and Adam Book: A Survival Guide to Life and Love&quot;, an advice book written in a tone similar to the radio show, was released in 1998.

The series has also spawned a number of &quot;Loveline&quot;-inspired games that have been mentioned on the show.

A thinly-veiled reference to &quot;Loveline&quot; can be seen in the 1988 film &quot;Heathers&quot; in a scene featuring a radio call-in advice program called &quot;Hot Probs&quot; hosted by Jim Trenton, the then-host of &quot;Loveline&quot;.

<text>The Director is a 1970 novel by American author Henry Denker.

The novel is about an ambitious young film director, named Jock Finley, who uses two prominent film stars Carr and Daisy Donnel (ostensibly based on Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe) to rebuild his already damaged career. The novel is laced with sharp dialogue and explicit sexual encounters in line with the counterculture of the 1970s. The Underlying theme of the novel is the clash of generations as of values.

<doc id="388148" wikidata="Q6762922" url="?curid=388148" title="Marie Lloyd">
<text>Matilda Alice Victoria Wood (12 February 1870 – 7 October 1922), professionally known as Marie Lloyd (), was an English music hall singer, comedian and musical theatre actress. She was best known for her performances of songs such as &quot;The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Dilly Dally on the Way&quot; and &quot;Oh Mr Porter What Shall I Do&quot;. She received both criticism and praise for her use of innuendo and double entendre during her performances, but enjoyed a long and prosperous career, during which she was affectionately called the &quot;Queen of the Music Hall&quot;.

Born in London, she was showcased by her father at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton. In 1884, she made her professional début as Bella Delmere; she changed her stage name to Marie Lloyd the following year. In 1885, she had success with her song &quot;The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery&quot;, and she frequently topped the bill at prestigious theatres in London&#x27;s West End. In 1891, she was recruited by the impresario Augustus Harris to appear in that year&#x27;s spectacular Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Christmas pantomime &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;. She starred in a further two productions at the theatre, &quot;Little Bo Peep&quot; (1892) and &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1893). By the mid-1890s, Lloyd was in frequent dispute with Britain&#x27;s theatre censors due to the risqué content of her songs.

Between 1894 and 1900, she became an international success when she toured France, America, Australia and Belgium with her solo music hall act. In 1907, she assisted other performers during the music hall war and took part in demonstrations outside theatres, protesting for better pay and conditions for performers. During the First World War, in common with most other music hall artists, she supported recruitment into the armed services to help the war effort, touring hospitals and industrial institutions to help boost morale. In 1915, she performed her only wartime song &quot;Now You&#x27;ve Got Your Khaki On&quot;, which became a favourite among front-line troops.

Lloyd had a turbulent private life that was often the subject of press attention: she was married three times, divorced twice, and frequently found herself giving court testimony against two of her husbands who had physically abused her. In later life, she was still in demand at music halls and had a late success in 1919 with her performance of &quot;My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)&quot;, which became one of her most popular songs. Privately, she suffered from bouts of ill-health and became alcohol-dependent, both of which imposed restrictions on her performing career by the 1920s. In 1922, she gave her final performance at the Alhambra Theatre, London, during which she became ill on stage. She died a few days later at the age of 52.

==Biography==

===Family background and early life===

Lloyd was born on 12 February 1870 in Hoxton, London. Her father, John Wood (1847–1940), was an artificial flower arranger and waiter; her mother, Matilda Mary Caroline &quot;née&quot; Archer (1849–1931), was a dressmaker and costume designer. Lloyd was the eldest of nine children and became known within the family circle as Tilley. The Wood family were respectable, hard-working, and financially comfortable. Lloyd often took career advice from her mother, whose influence was strong in the family. Lloyd attended a school in Bath Street, London, but disliked formal education and often played truant; with both her parents working, she adopted a maternal role over her siblings, helping to keep them entertained, clean and well cared-for. Along with her sister Alice, she arranged events in which the Wood children performed at the family home. Lloyd enjoyed entertaining her family and decided to form a minstrel act in 1879 called the Fairy Bell troupe, comprising her siblings.
Lloyd and the troupe made their début at a mission in Nile Street, Hoxton, in 1880 and followed this with an appearance at the Blue Ribbon Gospel Temperance Mission later the same year. Costumed by Matilda, they toured local doss-houses in East London, where they performed temperance songs, teaching people the dangers of alcohol abuse. Eager to show off his daughter&#x27;s talent, John secured her unpaid employment as a table singer at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton, where he worked as a waiter. Among the songs she performed there was &quot;My Soldier Laddie&quot;. Together with her performances at the Eagle, Lloyd briefly contributed to the family income by making babies&#x27; boots, and, later, curled feathers for hat making. She was unsuccessful at both and was sacked from the latter after being caught dancing on the tables by the foreman. She returned home that evening and declared that she wanted a permanent career on the stage. Although happy to have her performing in her spare time, her parents initially opposed the idea of her appearing on the stage full-time. She recalled that when her parents &quot;saw that they couldn&#x27;t kick their objections as high as [she] could kick [her] legs, they very sensibly came to the conclusion to let things take their course and said &#x27;Bless you my child, do what you like&#x27;.&quot;

===Early career and first marriage===

On 9 May 1885, at the age of 15, Lloyd made her professional solo stage début at the Grecian music hall (in the same premises as the Eagle Tavern), under the name &quot;Matilda Wood&quot;. She performed &quot;In the Good Old Days&quot; and &quot;My Soldier Laddie&quot;, which proved successful, and earned her a booking at the Sir John Falstaff music hall in Old Street where she sang a series of romantic ballads. Soon after this, she chose the stage name Bella Delmere and appeared on stage in costumes designed by her mother. Her performances were a success, despite her singing other artists&#x27; songs without their permission, a practice which brought her a threat of an injunction from one of the original performers. News of her act travelled; that October, she appeared at Collins&#x27;s Music Hall in Islington in a special performance to celebrate the theatre&#x27;s refurbishment, the first time she had appeared outside Hoxton, and two months later, she was engaged at the Hammersmith Temple of Varieties and the Middlesex Music Hall in Drury Lane. On 3 February 1886, she appeared at the prestigious Sebright Music Hall in Bethnal Green, where she met George Ware, a prolific composer of music hall songs. Ware became her agent and, after a few weeks, she began performing songs purchased from little-known composers. As her popularity grew, Ware suggested that she change her name. &quot;Marie&quot; was chosen for its &quot;posh&quot; and &quot;slightly French&quot; sound, and &quot;Lloyd&quot; was taken from an edition of &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Weekly Newspaper&quot;.

Lloyd established her new name on 22 June 1886, with an appearance at the Falstaff Music Hall, where she attracted wide notice for the song &quot;The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery&quot; (which was initially written for Nelly Power by Lloyd&#x27;s agent George Ware). By 1887, her performance of the song had become so popular that she was in demand in London&#x27;s West End, including the Oxford Music Hall, where she excelled at skirt dancing. George Belmont, the Falstaff&#x27;s proprietor, secured her an engagement at the Star Palace of Varieties in Bermondsey. She soon began making her own costumes, a skill she learned from her mother, and one she used for the rest of her career. She undertook a month-long tour of Ireland at the start of 1886, earning £10 per week after which she returned to East London to perform at, amongst others, the Sebright Music Hall, Bethnal Green. On 23 October, &quot;The Era&quot; called her &quot;a pretty little soubrette who dances with great dash and energy.&quot;
By the end of 1886, Lloyd was playing several halls a night and earned £100 per week. She was now able to afford new songs from established music hall composers and writers, including &quot;Harry&#x27;s a Soldier&quot;, &quot;She Has a Sailor for a Lover&quot;, and &quot;Oh Jeremiah, Don&#x27;t You Go to Sea&quot;. By 1887, Lloyd began to display a skill for ad lib, and to gain a reputation for her impromptu performances. It was during this period that she first sang &quot;Whacky-Wack&quot; and &quot;When you Wink the Other Eye&quot;, a song which introduced her famous wink at the audience. Unlike her West End audiences who enjoyed her coarse humour, her &quot;blue&quot; performances did not impress audiences in the East End.

While appearing at the Foresters music hall in Mile End, she met and began dating Percy Charles Courtenay, a ticket tout from Streatham, London. The courtship was brief, and the couple married on 12 November 1887 at St John the Baptist, Hoxton. In May 1888, Lloyd gave birth to a daughter, Marie Courtenay (1888–1967). The marriage was mostly unhappy, and Courtenay was disliked by Lloyd&#x27;s family and friends. Before long, Courtenay became addicted to alcohol and gambling, and grew jealous of his wife&#x27;s close friendship with the 13-year-old actress Bella Burge, to whom Lloyd had rented a room in the marital house. He also became angry at the numerous parties Lloyd hosted for fellow members of the music hall profession including Gus Elen, Dan Leno and Eugene Stratton.

In October 1888, Lloyd returned from maternity leave and joined rehearsals for the 1888–89 pantomime &quot;The Magic Dragon of the Demon Dell; or, The Search for the Mystic Thyme&quot;, in which she was cast as Princess Kristina. The production, which was staged between Boxing Day and February at the Britannia theatre in Hoxton, gave her the security of working close to home for a two-month period. The engagement also gave her much-needed experience of playing to a big audience. The following year, she appeared at more Bohemian venues including the Empire and the Alhambra theatres, the Trocadero Palace of Varieties, and the Royal Standard playhouse. In 1889, she gave birth to a stillborn child, which further damaged her marriage.
By the start of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a successful catalogue of songs, which included &quot;What&#x27;s That For, Eh?&quot;, about a little girl who asks her parents the meaning of various everyday household objects. Her biographer and theatre historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope described the song as being &quot;blue&quot; and thought that it spoke volumes about her reputation thanks to her &quot;wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the nod of the head.&quot; Similar-styled songs followed; &quot;She&#x27;d Never had her Ticket Punched Before&quot;, told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train. This was followed by &quot;The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance Go By&quot;; &quot;We Don&#x27;t Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If We Do&quot;; &quot;Oh You Wink the Other Eye&quot; and &quot;Twiggy Vous&quot;—a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad. After an evening&#x27;s performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage. Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She took a chance and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself as a member of the French government. He confirmed to her that &quot;Twiggy Vous&quot; was &quot;most popular in Paris&quot;; she was delighted at the news. At the end of the year, Lloyd returned to London where she appeared in the Christmas pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; in Peckham alongside her sister Alice.

===1890s===

====Drury Lane and success====

Between 1891 and 1893, Lloyd was recruited by the impresario Augustus Harris to appear alongside Dan Leno in the spectacular and popular Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Christmas pantomimes. While lunching with Harris in 1891 to discuss his offer, Lloyd played coy, deliberately confusing the theatre with the lesser known venue the Old Mo so as not to appear conscious of Drury Lane&#x27;s successful reputation; she compared its structure to that of a prison. Secretly, she was thrilled with the offer, for which she would receive £100 per week. The pantomime seasons lasted from Boxing Day to March and were highly lucrative, but Lloyd found working from a script restrictive. Her first role was Princess Allfair in &quot;Humpty Dumpty; or, The Yellow Dwarf and the Fair One&quot;, which she dismissed as being &quot;Bloody awful, eh?&quot; She received mixed reviews for her opening performance. &quot;The Times&quot; described her as being &quot;playful in gesture, graceful in appearance, but not strong in voice.&quot; Despite the weak start (which Lloyd blamed on nerves), the pantomime received glowing reviews from the theatrical press. The &quot;London Entr&#x27;acte&quot; thought that she &quot;delivere[d] her text quite pungently, and sings and dances with spirit too.&quot; She was noted for her acrobatic dancing on stage, and was able to display handstands, tumbles and high kicks. As a boy, the writer Compton Mackenzie was taken to the show&#x27;s opening night and admitted that he was &quot;greatly surprised that any girl should have the courage to let the world see her drawers as definitely as Marie Lloyd.&quot;

Lloyd&#x27;s biographer Midge Gillies defines 1891 as being the year that she officially &quot;made it&quot; thanks to a catalogue of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; &quot;The Era&quot; called her &quot;the favourite of the hour&quot;. During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. The 1892 pantomime was &quot;Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O&#x27; My Thumb&quot;, in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. The production was five hours long and culminated with the show&#x27;s harlequinade. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when she got out of bed to pray, but instead reached for a chamber pot. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her not to do it again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said &quot;Isn&#x27;t Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? I think of little besides her.&quot; On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening&#x27;s performance of &quot;Little Bo-Peep&quot;. Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station. In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called &quot;The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous&quot;, which, according to MacQueen-Pope, &quot;ended the Queen of Comedy&#x27;s career as an actress&quot;.
Lloyd made her American stage début in 1893, appearing at Koster and Bial&#x27;s Music Hall in New York. She sang &quot;Oh You Wink the Other Eye&quot;, much to the delight of her American audiences. Other numbers were &quot;After the Pantomime&quot; and &quot;You Should Go to France and See the Ladies Dance&quot;, which both required her to wear provocative costumes. Her performances pleased the theatre proprietors, who presented her with an antique tea and coffee service. News of her success reached home, and the &quot;London Entr&#x27;acte&quot; reported that &quot;Miss Marie Lloyd made the biggest hit ever known at Koster and Bial&#x27;s variety hall, New York.&quot;

Upon her return to London, Lloyd introduced &quot;Listen with the Right Ear&quot;, which was an intended follow-up to &quot;Oh You Wink the Other Eye&quot;. Shortly after her return, she sailed to France, to take up an engagement in Paris. Her biographer Daniel Farson thought that she received &quot;greater acclaim than any other English comedienne who had preceded her&quot;. She changed the lyrics to some of her best-known songs for her French audience and retitled them, &quot;The Naughty Continong&quot;; &quot;Twiggy Vous&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;m Just Back from Paris&quot; and &quot;The Coster Honeymoon in Paris&quot;. At Christmas in 1893, she returned to London to honour her final Drury Lane commitment, starring as Polly Perkins in &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. The part allowed her to perform &quot;The Barmaid&quot; and &quot;The Naughty Continong&quot; and saw her perform a mazurka with Leno. Talking to a friend years later about her Drury Lane engagements, she admitted that she was &quot;the proudest little woman in the world&quot;.

In May 1894, Courtenay followed Lloyd to the Empire, Leicester Square, where she was performing, and attempted to batter her with a stick, shouting: &quot;I will gouge your eyes out and ruin you!&quot; His assault missed Lloyd, but struck Burge in the face instead. As a result of the incident, Lloyd was sacked from the Empire for fear of a reprisal. Lloyd left the marital home, moving to 73 Carleton Road, Tufnell Park and successfully applied for a restraining warrant, which prevented Courtenay from contacting her. A few weeks later, Lloyd began an affair with the music hall singer Alec Hurley, which resulted in Courtenay initiating divorce proceedings in 1894 on the grounds of her adultery. That year, together with a short tour of the English provinces, Lloyd travelled to New York with Hurley, where she appeared at the Imperial Theatre, staying for two months. On her return to England, she appeared in the Liverpool Christmas pantomime as the principal boy in &quot;Pretty Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, and the Merry Old Woman who lived in a Shoe&quot;. Her performance was praised by the press, who called her &quot;delightfully easy, graceful and self-possessed.&quot;

====Risqué reputation and transatlantic tours====

By 1895, Lloyd&#x27;s risqué songs were receiving frequent criticism from theatre reviewers and influential feminists. As a result, she often experienced resistance from strict theatre censorship which dogged the rest of her career. The writer and feminist Laura Ormiston Chant, who was a member of the Social Purity Alliance, disliked the bawdiness of music hall performances, and thought that the venues were attractive to prostitutes. Her campaign persuaded the London County Council to erect large screens around the promenade at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, as part of the licensing conditions. The screens were unpopular and protesters, among them the young Winston Churchill, later pulled them down. That November at the Tivoli theatre, Lloyd performed &quot;Johnny Jones&quot;, a ditty about a girl who is taught the facts of life by her best male friend. The song, although not lyrically obscene, was considered to be offensive largely because of the manner in which Lloyd sang it, adding winks and gestures, and creating a conspiratorial relationship with her audience. Social reformers cited &quot;Johnny Jones&quot; as being offensive, but less so compared to other songs of the day. Upon the expiry of a music hall&#x27;s entertainments licence, the Licensing Committee tried to use the lyrical content of music hall songs as evidence against a renewal. As a result, Lloyd was summoned to perform some of her songs in front of a council committee. She sang &quot;Oh! Mr Porter&quot; (composed for her by George Le Brunn); &quot;A Little of What You Fancy&quot;; and, according to some writers, &quot;She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas&quot;, which she retitled &quot;I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks&quot; after some protest. The numbers were sung in such a way that the committee had no reason to find anything amiss. Feeling disgruntled at the council&#x27;s interference, she then rendered Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s drawing-room ballad &quot;Come into the Garden, Maud&quot; with leers and nudges to illustrate each innuendo. The committee were left stunned at the performance, but Lloyd argued afterwards that the rudeness was &quot;all in the mind&quot;.
Despite their opposing views on music hall entertainment, Lloyd and Chant shared similar political views, and were wrongly assumed by the press to be enemies. An inspector who reported on one of Lloyd&#x27;s performances at the Oxford music hall thought that her lyrical content was fine but her knowing nods, looks, smiles and the suggestiveness in her winks to the audience suggested otherwise. The restrictions imposed on the music halls were, by now beginning to affect trade, and many were threatened with closure. To avoid social unrest, Hackney council scrapped the licensing restrictions on 7 October 1896. In 1896, Lloyd sailed to South Africa with her daughter, who appeared as Little Maudie Courtenay on the same bill as her mother. Lloyd came to the attention of Barney Barnato, a British entrepreneur who was responsible for mining diamond and gold. Barnato lavished gifts on her in an attempt to woo her, but his attempts were unsuccessful; nevertheless, the two remained friends until his death in 1897. The tour was a triumph for Lloyd, and her songs became popular among her South African audience. She performed &quot;Wink the Other Eye&quot;, &quot;Twiggy-Vous&quot;, &quot;Hello, Hello, Hello&quot;, &quot;Whacky, Whacky, Whack!&quot;, &quot;Keep Off the Grass&quot;, and &quot;Oh! Mr Porter&quot;. Feeling satisfied at the success she had achieved, Lloyd returned to London once the two-month tour had ended.
The following year, Lloyd travelled to New York where she re-appeared at Koster and Bial&#x27;s Music Hall. Her first song was about a young woman who lacked confidence in finding a suitor. The chorus, &quot;Not for the very best man that ever got into a pair of trousers&quot;, proved hilarious; &quot;The Era&quot; observed that the line &quot;tickled the audience immensely&quot;. Following this, she performed a song about a French maid who appeared innocent and petite at first sight, but turned out not to be so. &quot;The Era&quot; described the character as being &quot;not so demure as she looked, for she confided to her auditors that she &#x27;knew a lot about those tricky little things they don&#x27;t teach a girl at school&#x27;.&quot; Many other songs followed and were all warmly received. At the conclusion of each performance, she received gifts from the audience including bouquets and floral structures. &quot;The Era&quot; commented that &quot;Miss Lloyd&#x27;s clever character work, her versatility and unflagging endeavours to please were rewarded with deserved success&quot;. After the tour, Lloyd returned to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley. That Christmas, she appeared in pantomime, this time at the Crown Theatre in Peckham in a production of &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; in which she played the title role. In it, she sang &quot;A Little Bit Off the Top&quot;, which MacQueen-Pope describes as being &quot;one of the pantomime songs of the year&quot;. &quot;The Music Hall and Theatre Review&quot; was equally complimentary, saying: &quot;Brilliant Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!&quot; During the Christmas period of 1898–9, Lloyd returned to the Crown where she took her benefit, during which she appeared in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot;. The entertainment culminated with a song from Vesta Victoria, and a short piece called &quot;The Squeaker&quot;, starring Joe Elvin.

===1900s===
In February 1900, Lloyd was the subject of another benefit performance at the Crown Theatre in Peckham. Kate Carney, Vesta Tilley and Joe Elvin were among the star turns who performed before the main piece, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, which starred Lloyd, her sister Alice, Kittee Rayburn and Jennie Rubie. The same year, although her divorce was not yet finalised, Lloyd went to live with Hurley in Southampton Row, London. Hurley, an established singer of coster songs, regularly appeared on the same bill as Lloyd; his calm nature was a contrast to the abusive personality of Courtenay. Lloyd and Hurley set sail for a tour of Australia in 1901, opening at Harry Rickards Opera House in Melbourne on 18 May with their own version of &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot;. After the successful two-month tour, Lloyd and Hurley returned to London where she appeared in the only revue of her career. Entitled &quot;The Revue&quot;, it was written by Charles Raymond and Phillip Yorke with lyrics by Roland Carse and music by Maurice Jacobi. It was staged at the Tivoli theatre, in celebration of the Coronation of King Edward VII. Lloyd and Courtenay&#x27;s divorce became absolute on 22 May 1905, and she married Hurley on 27 October 1906. Hurley, although ecstatic with his earlier success in Australia, began feeling sidelined by his wife&#x27;s popularity. MacQueen-Pope suggested that &quot;[Hurley] was a star who had married a planet. Already the seeds of disaster were being sown.&quot;

====Music hall strikes of 1907====

Shortly after her marriage to Hurley, Lloyd went to Bournemouth to recuperate from exhaustion. Within days she was back performing in London music halls. From the start of the new century, music hall artistes and theatre managers had been in dispute over working conditions, a reduction in pay and perks, and an increased number of matinée performances. The first significant rift was a 1906 strike, initiated by the Variety Artistes&#x27; Federation. The following year, the Music Hall War commenced, which saw the Federation fight for more freedom and better working conditions on behalf of music-hall performers. Although popular enough to command her own fees, Lloyd supported the strike, acted as a picket for the strikers and gave generously to the strike fund. To raise spirits, she often performed on picket lines and took part in a fundraising performance at the Scala Theatre. The dispute ended later the same year with a resolution broadly favourable to the performers. In 1909, Lloyd appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in Dundee where a critic for &quot;The Courier&quot; noted &quot;Her bright smile and fascinating presence has much to do with her popularity, while her songs are of the catchy style, perhaps not what a Dundee audience is familiar with, but still amusing and of an attractive style.&quot;

====Relationship with Bernard Dillon====

Despite their marital problems, Lloyd went on an American tour with Hurley in 1908. She was eager to equal the success of her sister Alice, who had become popular in the country a few years previously. By 1910, Marie&#x27;s relationship with Hurley had ended, due in part to her endless parties and her developing friendship with the jockey Bernard Dillon, winner of the 1910 Derby. Lloyd and the young sportsman began an open and passionate affair. For the first time, her private life eclipsed her professional career. She was seldom mentioned in the theatrical press in 1910, and when she did perform, it was not to the best of her abilities. The writer Arnold Bennett, who witnessed her on stage at the Tivoli Theatre in 1909, admitted that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t see the legendary cleverness of the vulgarity of Marie Lloyd&quot; and accused her songs of being &quot;variations of the same theme of sexual naughtiness.&quot; As with Courtenay years previously, the shy and retiring Dillon was finding it hard to adapt to Lloyd&#x27;s elaborate and sociable lifestyle. Dillon&#x27;s success on the racecourse was short lived. In 1911, he was expelled from the Jockey Club for borrowing £660 to bet on his own horses to win. Dillon&#x27;s horses lost, and he ended up in debt to trainers. He became jealous of Lloyd&#x27;s successful life in the spotlight. Depression led to drink and obesity, and he started to abuse her. Hurley, meanwhile, had initiated divorce proceedings, the strain of which caused him to drink heavily, which in turn finished his theatrical career. Lloyd left the marital home in Hampstead and moved to Golders Green with Dillon, a move which MacQueen-Pope describes as being &quot;the worst thing she ever did.&quot;

===Later years===
A new show in London in 1912 showcased the best of music hall&#x27;s talent. The Royal Command Performance took place at the Palace Theatre in London, which was managed by Alfred Butt. The show was organised by Oswald Stoll, an Australian impresario who managed a string of West End and provincial theatres. Stoll, although a fan of Lloyd&#x27;s, disliked the vulgarity of her act and championed a return to a more family-friendly atmosphere within the music hall. Because of this, and her participation in the earlier music hall war, Stoll left her out of the line-up. He placed an advert in &quot;The Era&quot; on the day of the performance warning that &quot;Coarseness and vulgarity etc are not allowed ... this intimation is rendered necessary only by a few artists&quot;. In retaliation, Lloyd staged her own show at the London Pavilion, advertising that &quot;every one of her performances was a command performance by order of the British public&quot;. She performed &quot;One Thing Leads to Another&quot;, &quot;Oh Mr Porter&quot;, and &quot;The Boy I Love Is up in the Gallery&quot; and was hailed as &quot;the Queen of Comedy&quot; by critics. The same year, she travelled to Devon where she appeared at the Exeter Hippodrome to much success. &quot;The Devon and Exeter Gazette&quot;, reported that Lloyd&#x27;s performance of &quot;Every Movement Tells a Tale&quot;, was &quot;thoroughly enjoyed&quot; by the audience and &quot;[received] round after round of applause&quot;. The paper also praised her recital of a &quot;Cockney girl&#x27;s honeymoon in Paris&quot;, which was met by &quot;roars of laughter&quot;.

====Scandal in America====
In 1913, Lloyd was booked by the Orpheum Syndicate to appear at the New York Palace Theatre. She and Dillon set sail on the RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; under the name Mr and Mrs Dillon and were met at the American port by her sister Alice, who had resided in the country for many years. Upon arrival, Lloyd and Dillon were refused entry when the authorities found out that they were not married, as they had claimed when applying for entry visas. They were detained and threatened with deportation on the grounds of moral turpitude and were sent to Ellis Island while an enquiry took place. Dillon was charged under the White Slave Act with attempting to take into the country a woman who was not his wife, and Lloyd was charged with being a passive agent. After a lengthy enquiry, a surety of $300 each, and an imposed condition that they were to live apart while in America, the couple were allowed to stay until March 1914. Alice later stated that &quot;the indignity of the subsequent experience [while in custody] went to Marie&#x27;s heart in a way she never survived. She could not bear to talk of that awful twenty-four hours.&quot;
Despite the problems, the tour was a success, and Lloyd performed to packed theatres throughout America. Her act featured the songs &quot;The Twiddly Wink&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)&quot;, and &quot;The Aviator&quot;. The numbers were popular, partly due to the Americanisation of each song&#x27;s lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd&#x27;s time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, Edward Albee, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced. The &quot;New York Telegraph&quot; speculated &quot;In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the bottom of her attacks of disposition.&quot; Back in England, Hurley had died of pleurisy and pneumonia on 6 December 1913. Lloyd heard the news while appearing in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying &quot;until we meet again&quot;. She was reported in &quot;The Morning Telegraph&quot; as saying: &quot;With all due respect to the dead, I can cheerfully say that&#x27;s the best piece of news I&#x27;ve heard in many years, for it means that Bernard Dillon and I will marry as soon as this unlucky year ends.&quot; Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914, the ceremony taking place at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon. When the tour finished, Lloyd commented, &quot;[I will] never forget the humiliation to which I have been subjected and I shall never sing in America again, no matter how high the salary offered.&quot;

====First World War and final years====
Lloyd and Dillon returned to England in June 1914. Lloyd started a provincial tour of Liverpool, Aldershot, Southend, Birmingham and Margate, and finished the summer season at the London Hippodrome. She sang &quot;The Coster Honeymoon in Paris&quot; and &quot;Who Paid the Rent for Mrs Rip Van Winkle?&quot;, the latter of which had been received particularly well with her American audiences. Within a fortnight, Britain was at war, which threw the music-hall world into disarray. The atmosphere in London&#x27;s music halls had turned patriotic, and theatre proprietors often held charity events and benefits to help the war effort. Lloyd played her part and frequently visited hospitals, including the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital in Belfast, where she interacted with wounded servicemen. She also toured munitions factories to help boost public morale, but received no official recognition for her work. During 1914, she scored a hit with &quot;A Little of What You Fancy Does You Good&quot;, which critics thought captured her life perfectly up until that point. The song is about a middle-aged woman who encourages the younger generation to enjoy themselves, rather than indulging in life&#x27;s excitement herself. During the rendition, Lloyd depicts a young couple who cuddle and kiss on a railway carriage, while she sits back and recalls memories of her doing the same in years gone by.

In January 1915, Lloyd appeared at the Crystal Palace where she entertained over ten thousand troops. At the end of that year, she performed her only war song, &quot;Now You&#x27;ve Got your Khaki On&quot;, composed for her by Charles Collins and Fred W. Leigh, about a woman who found the army uniform sexy and thought that wearing it made the average pot-bellied gentleman look like a muscle-toned soldier. Lloyd&#x27;s brother John appeared with her on stage dressed as a soldier and helped characterise the ditty. Following this, she sang the already well-established songs &quot;If You Want to Get On in Revue&quot;, which depicted a young girl who offered sexual favours to promote her theatrical career, and &quot;The Three Ages of Woman&quot;, which took a cynical look at men from a woman&#x27;s perspective. She seldom toured during the war, but briefly performed in Northampton, Watford and Nottingham in 1916. By the end of that year, she had suffered a nervous breakdown which she blamed on her hectic workload and a delayed reaction to Hurley&#x27;s death. During the war years, Lloyd&#x27;s public image had deteriorated. Her biographer Midge Gillies thought that Lloyd&#x27;s violent relationship with Dillon and professional snubs in public had left the singer feeling like &quot;someone&#x27;s mother, rather than their sweetheart.&quot;

In July 1916, Dillon was conscripted into the army, but disliked the discipline of regimental life. He applied for exemption on the grounds he had to look after his parents and four brothers, but his claim was rejected. In a later failed attempt, he tried to convince army officials that he was too obese to carry out military duties. On the rare occasions when Dillon was allowed home on leave, he would often indulge in drinking sessions. One night, Lloyd&#x27;s friend Bella Burge answered a knock at the front door to find a hysterical Lloyd covered in blood and bruises. When asked to explain what had caused her injuries, she stated that she had caught Dillon in bed with another woman and had had a showdown with her husband. By 1917, Dillon&#x27;s drinking had become worse. That June, two constables were called to Lloyd and Dillon&#x27;s house in Golders Green after Dillon committed a drunken assault on his wife. Police entered the house and found Lloyd and her maid cowering beneath a table. Dillon confronted the constables and assaulted one of them, which resulted in him being taken to court, fined and sentenced to a month&#x27;s hard labour. Lloyd began drinking to escape the trauma of her domestic abuse. That year, she was earning £470 per week performing in music halls and making special appearances. By 1918, she had become popular with the British-based American soldiers, but had failed to capture the spirits of their English counterparts, and began feeling sidelined by her peers; Vesta Tilley had led a very successful recruitment drive into the services, and other music hall performers had been honoured by royalty. The following year, she performed perhaps her best known song, &quot;My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)&quot;, which was written for her by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins. The song depicts a mother fleeing her home to avoid the rent man. The lyrics reflected the hardships of working class life in London at the beginning of the 20th century, and gave her the chance to costume the character in a worn out dress and black straw boater, while carrying a birdcage.

In July 1919, Lloyd was again left off the cast list for the Royal Variety Performance, which paid tribute to the acts who helped raise money and boost morale during the war years. She was devastated at the snub and grew bitter towards her rivals who had been acknowledged. Her biographer Midge Gillies compared Lloyd to a &quot;talented old aunt who must be allowed to have her turn at the piano even though all everyone really wants is jazz or go to the Picture Palace&quot;. She toured Cardiff in 1919, and in 1920 she was earning £11,000 a year. Despite the high earnings, she was living beyond her means, with a reckless tendency to spend money. She was famous for her generosity, but was unable to differentiate between those in need and those who simply exploited her kindness. Her extravagant tastes, an accumulation of writs from disgruntled theatre managers, an inability to save money, and generous hand-outs to friends and family, resulted in severe money troubles during the final years of her life.

===Decline and death===

In 1920, Lloyd appeared twice at Hendon Magistrates Court and gave evidence of the abuse she had suffered from Dillon. Soon afterwards, she separated from him and, as a result, became depressed. When asked by prosecutors how many times Dillon had assaulted her since Christmas 1919, Lloyd replied &quot;I cannot tell you, there were so many [occasions]. It has happened for years, time after time, always when he is drunk.&quot; By now, she was becoming increasingly unreliable on stage; she appeared at a theatre in Cardiff for a mere six minutes before being carried off by stage hands. During the performance, she seemed dazed and confused, and she stumbled across the stage. She was conscious of her weak performances and frequently cried between shows. Virginia Woolf was among the audience at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and described Lloyd as &quot;A mass of corruption – long front teeth – a crapulous way of saying &#x27;desire&#x27;, and yet a born artist – scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing.&quot;

In April 1922, Lloyd collapsed in her dressing room after singing &quot;The Cosmopolitan Girl&quot; at the Gateshead Empire in Cardiff. Her doctor diagnosed exhaustion, and she returned to the stage in August. Her voice became weak, and she reduced her act to a much shorter running time. Her biographer Naomi Jacob thought that Lloyd was &quot;growing old, and [she] was determined to show herself to her public as she really was ... an old, grey-faced, tired woman&quot;. On 12 August 1921, Lloyd failed to show for an appearance at the London Palladium, choosing instead to stay at home and write her will.

In early 1922, Lloyd moved in with her sister Daisy to save money. On 4 October, against her doctor&#x27;s advice, she appeared at the Empire Music Hall in Edmonton, North London, where she sang &quot;I&#x27;m One of the Ruins That Cromwell Knocked About a Bit&quot;. Her performance was weak, and she was unsteady on her feet, eventually falling over on stage. Her erratic and brief performance proved hilarious for the audience, who thought that it was all part of the act. Three days later, while appearing at the Alhambra Theatre, she was taken ill on stage and was found later in her dressing room crippled with pain, complaining of stomach cramps. She returned home later that evening, where she died of heart and kidney failure, aged 52. More than 50,000 people attended her funeral at Hampstead Cemetery on 12 October 1922. Lloyd was penniless at the time of her death and her estate, which was worth £7,334, helped to pay off debts that she and Dillon had incurred over the years. In their announcement of Lloyd&#x27;s death, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote:

In her the public loses not only a vivid personality whose range and extremely broad humour as a character actress were extraordinary, but also one of the few remaining links with the old music-hall stage of the last century.

Writing in &quot;The Dial&quot; magazine the following month, T. S. Eliot claimed: &quot;Among [the] small number of music-hall performers, whose names are familiar to what is called the lower class, Marie Lloyd had far the strongest hold on popular affection.&quot; Her biographer and friend MacQueen-Pope thought that Lloyd was &quot;going downhill of her own volition. The complaint was incurable, some might call it heartbreak, perhaps a less sentimental diagnosis is disillusionment.&quot; The impersonator Charles Austin paid tribute by saying &quot;I have lost an old pal, and the public has lost its principal stage favourite, one who can never be replaced.&quot;

<doc id="388149" wikidata="Q487865" url="?curid=388149" title="Dervish">
<text>Dervish, Darvesh, or Darwīsh (from ) in Islam can refer broadly to members of a Sufi fraternity (&quot;tariqah&quot;), or more narrowly to a religious mendicant, who chose or accepted material poverty. The latter usage is found particularly in Persian and Turkish (&quot;derviş&quot;) as well as in Tamazight (&quot;Aderwic&quot;), corresponding to the Arabic term &quot;faqīr&quot;. Their focus is on the universal values of love and service, deserting the illusions of ego (&quot;nafs&quot;) to reach God. In most Sufi orders, a dervish is known to practice &quot;dhikr&quot; through physical exertions or religious practices to attain the ecstatic trance to reach God. Their most popular practice is Sama, which is associated with the 13th-century mystic Rumi. In folklore and with adherents of Sufism, dervishes are often credited with the ability to perform miracles and ascribed supernatural powers. Historically, the term Dervish has also been used more loosely, as the designation of various Islamic political movements or military entities.

==Etymology==
The Kurdish word &quot;darvīsh&quot; () is of ancient origin and descends from a Iranian word that appears in Avestan as , &quot;needy, mendicant&quot;, via Middle Persian &quot;driyosh&quot;. It has the same meaning as the Arabic word &quot;faqīr&quot;, meaning people whose contingency and utter dependence upon God is manifest in everything they do and every breath they take.

==Religious practice==
Dervishes try to approach God by virtues and individual experience, rather than by religious scholarship.
Many dervishes are mendicant ascetics who have taken a vow of poverty, unlike mullahs. The main reason they beg is to learn humility, but dervishes are prohibited to beg for their own good. They have to give the collected money to other poor people. Others work in common professions; Egyptian Qadiriyya – known in Turkey as Kadiri – are fishermen, for example.

Some classical writers indicate that the poverty of the dervish is not merely economic. Saadi, for instance, who himself travelled widely as a dervish, and wrote extensively about them, says in his &quot;Gulistan&quot;:
Rumi writes in Book 1 of his Masnavi:
==Whirling dervishes==

The whirling dance or Sufi whirling that is proverbially associated with dervishes is best known in the West by the practices (performances) of the Mevlevi order in Turkey, and is part of a formal ceremony known as the Sama. It is, however, also practiced by other orders. The Sama is only one of the many Sufi ceremonies performed to try to reach religious ecstasy (&quot;majdhb&quot;, &quot;fana&quot;). The name &quot;Mevlevi&quot; comes from the Persian poet Rumi, who was a dervish himself. This practice, though not intended as entertainment, has become a tourist attraction in Turkey.

==Orders==

There are various orders of dervishes, almost all of which trace their origins from various Muslim saints and teachers, especially Imam Ali. Various orders and suborders have appeared and disappeared over the centuries. Dervishes spread into North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Turkey, Anatolia, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Iran, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.

Other dervish groups include the Bektashis, who are connected to the janissaries, and the Senussi, who are rather orthodox in their beliefs. Other fraternities and subgroups chant verses of the Qur&#x27;an, play drums or whirl in groups, all according to their specific traditions. They practice meditation, as is the case with most of the Sufi orders in South Asia, many of whom owe allegiance to, or were influenced by, the Chishti order. Each fraternity uses its own garb and methods of acceptance and initiation, some of which may be rather severe. The form of Sufi dervishism practised during the 17th century was centered upon esotericism, patience and pacifism.

==Other historical uses==
===Mahdists===

Various western historical writers have sometimes used the term &quot;dervish&quot; rather loosely, linking it to, among other things, the Mahdist War in Sudan and other conflicts by Islamic military leaders. In such cases, the term &quot;dervishes&quot; may have been used as a generic (and often pejorative) term for the opposing Islamic entity and all members of its military, political and religious institutions, including persons who would not be considered &quot;dervishes&quot; in the strict sense.

During the Mahdist War, Muḥammad Aḥmad al-Mahdī decreed that all those who came to join him should be called anṣār, after the Prophet&#x27;s earliest followers. He forbade the use of the term &#x27;dervish&#x27; to describe his followers. Despite this, British soldiers and colonial officials continued to use the term in relation to the &quot;anṣār&quot;. While some Britons used the term to denigrate the followers of the Mahdī, it was also used with a sense of admiration in accounts by British soldiers which describe the fearlessness and bravery of the lightly armed &#x27;dervishes&#x27;. Thus, the word has become closely associated with the &quot;anṣār&quot; and is often used inaccurately in relation to the Mahdi&#x27;s followers, even today.

For example, a contemporary British drawing of the fighting in Sudan was entitled &quot;The defeat of the dervishes at Toski&quot; (see History of Sudan (1884–1898)#British response).

== In literature ==
Various books discussing the lives of Dervishes can be found in Turkish literature. &quot;Death and the Dervish&quot; by Meša Selimović and &quot;The Dervish&quot; by Frances Kazan extensively discussed the life of a Dervish. 
Similar works on the subject have been found in other books such as &quot;Memoirs of a Dervish: Sufis, Mystics and the Sixties&quot; by Robert Erwin. Majdeddin Ali Bagher Ne&#x27;matollahi has said that Sufism is a core of being and bridge between religion and science.

== Views on Dervishes ==
Dervishes and their Sufis practices are accepted by traditional Sunni Muslims but different groups such as Deobandis, Salafis disregard various practices of Dervishes as un-Islamic.

<doc id="388151" wikidata="Q4828172" url="?curid=388151" title="Aventurescence">
<text>In gemology, aventurescence (sometimes called aventurization) is an optical reflectance effect seen in certain gems. The effect amounts to a metallic glitter, arising from minute, preferentially oriented mineral platelets within the material. These platelets are so numerous that they also influence the material&#x27;s body colour. In aventurine quartz, chrome-bearing fuchsite produces a green stone, and various iron oxides produce a red stone.

The words &quot;aventurine&quot; and &quot;aventurescence&quot; derive from the Italian &quot;a ventura&quot;, meaning &quot;by chance&quot;. This is an allusion to the chance discovery of aventurine glass (goldstone) at some point in the 18th century. Goldstone is still manufactured today as an artificial imitation of the later discoveries aventurine quartz and aventurine feldspar (sunstone).

<doc id="388159" wikidata="Q385346" url="?curid=388159" title="Haldimand County">
<text>Haldimand County is a rural city-status single-tier municipality on the Niagara Peninsula in Southern Ontario, Canada, on the north shore of Lake Erie, and on the Grand River. Despite its name, it is no longer a county by definition, as all municipal services are handled by a single level of government. Municipal offices are located in Cayuga.

The county is adjacent to Norfolk County, the County of Brant, the City of Hamilton, the township of West Lincoln and the township of Wainfleet.

==History==
Haldimand&#x27;s history has been closely associated with that of neighbouring Norfolk County. Upper Canada was created in 1791 by being separated from the old Province of Quebec, Haldimand was created in 1798 as part of the Niagara District. It was named after Sir Frederick Haldimand, the governor of the Province of Quebec from 1778 to 1785. In 1844, the land was surrendered by the Six Nations to the Crown in an agreement that was signed by the vast majority of Chiefs in the Haldimand tract. In 1974, Haldimand was incorporated as a town by the amalgamation of the villages of Cayuga, Hagersville and Caledonia and the townships of Oneida, Seneca, North Cayuga, South Cayuga and parts of Rainham and Walpole. In 2001, Haldimand was enlarged by amalgamating with Dunnville and half of Nanticoke.

Beginning in February 2006, a land dispute by native protesters began near Caledonia over a housing development being built on the outskirts of town, which members of the nearby Mohawk Six Nations people claim is rightfully their land. The issue reignited again in February 2020, when Mohawk protesters blocked off Highway 6 again in protest of McKenzie Meadows.

==Communities==
The population centres in Haldimand are Caledonia, Dunnville, Hagersville, Jarvis and Cayuga. Part of the Six Nations Reserve is within the geographic area of Haldimand County, but is independent of the county. Most of Haldimand is agricultural land, although some heavy industry, including the former Nanticoke Generating Station, is located here.

Smaller communities within the municipality are Attercliffe Station, Balmoral, Bodri Bay, Brookers Bay, Byng, Canborough, Canfield, Cheapside, Clanbrassil, Crescent Bay, Decewsville, Empire Corners, Featherstone Point, Fisherville, Garnet, Hoover Point, Kohler, Little Buffalo, Lowbanks, Moulton Station, Mount Carmel, Mount Healy, Nanticoke, Nelles Corners, Peacock Point, Port Maitland, Rainham Centre, Selkirk, Sims Lock, South Cayuga, Springvale, Stromness, Sweets Corners, Townsend, Willow Grove, Woodlawn Park and York.

The ghost towns of Cook&#x27;s Station, Cranston, Dufferin, Erie, Indiana, Lambs Corners, Lythmore, Sandusk, Upper, and Varency are also located within Haldimand.

==Historic townships==
Haldimand County&#x27;s area of 309,300 acres was formed from part of the land grant to the Six Nations in 1783. The County was purchased by treaty and opened for general settlement in 1832. It was first settled by white veterans of Butler&#x27;s Rangers established there by Joseph Brant. A large number of Germans were among the first settlers.

<doc id="388164" wikidata="Q8054870" url="?curid=388164" title="Yomp">
<text>Yomp is Royal Marines slang describing a long-distance loaded march carrying full kit. It was popularised by journalistic coverage in 1982 during the Falklands War. The origin of the word is unclear, and there is no evidence to suggest that it derives originally from an acronym. Various backronymic definitions have however been proposed, including &quot;young officers marching pace&quot;, &quot;your own marching pace&quot; and a connection with the term &quot;yump&quot; used in rally-driving in the sense of &quot;to leave the ground when taking a crest at speed&quot;, apparently a Scandinavian pronunciation of &quot;jump&quot;.

==Falklands War==
The word and its meaning came to national prominence in the UK during the Falklands War in 1982. After disembarking from ships at San Carlos on East Falkland, on 21 May 1982, Royal Marines and members of the Parachute Regiment yomped (and tabbed) with their equipment across the islands, covering in three days carrying loads. They were supposed to be transported by helicopters, but after the &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;, which carried the helicopters, was sunk by Argentinian Exocet missiles on 25 May, the soldiers had to march across the island.
===Photograph===
The image of Royal Marine Corporal Peter Robinson with a Union Jack fixed to his radio antenna became one of the most iconic images of the Falklands War. Now known as &quot;The Yomper&quot;, it was taken by Petty Officer Peter Holdgate, Commando Forces Photographer, whilst working as part of the Commando Forces News Team. After landing with 40 Commando at San Carlos, Holdgate accompanied British forces across the Falklands War zone taking hundreds of photographs as the Royal Marines proceeded along the Moody Brook track towards Stanley.

When news of the surrender of Argentine forces was received, Marine Trev Gillingham produced a small Union bunting flag from his bergen, which he had acquired from SS Canberra&#x27;s bunting locker. Marine Gillingham first tied the flag to Corporal Robinson&#x27;s radio aerial, who was the last man in the patrol. It eventually blew off and was then fixed with masking tape to the radio aerial. The photograph itself was entirely spontaneous and not staged. The original Union Jack has been lost.

=== Memorial ===

The image was used as the inspiration for a statue of Royal Marine Commando that was unveiled by Margaret Thatcher at the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea, Portsmouth on 8 July 1992 to mark the 10th anniversary of the conflict.

==Similar terms ==
British Army slang for the same marching conditions is &quot;tab&quot; (One suggestion is it&#x27;s from the acronym: Tactical Advance to Battle).

US military slang for this concept is to &quot;ruck&quot; (from the &quot;rucksack&quot; being carried) or to &quot;hump&quot; from the phrase &quot;humping a pack&quot;.

<doc id="388176" wikidata="Q715113" url="?curid=388176" title="EVA Air">
<text>EVA Airways Corporation ( ; ) () is an international airline headquartered in Taoyuan City. It is one of the two largest airlines in Taiwan along with state-owned China Airlines. The privately owned airline operates passenger and dedicated cargo services to over 40 international destinations in Asia, Australia, Europe &amp; North America. Its network fully consists of international routes, with no domestic routes. It is rated as a 5-star airline by Skytrax, and is the second largest airline based in Taiwan after China Airlines. EVA Air is headquartered at Taoyuan International Airport in Luzhu, Taoyuan City. The company slogan is &quot;Sharing the World, Flying Together&quot; ().

Since its founding in 1989 as an affiliate of shipping conglomerate Evergreen Group, EVA Air has expanded to include air cargo, airline catering, ground handling, and aviation engineering services. Its cargo arm, EVA Air Cargo, links with the Evergreen worldwide shipping network on sea and land. Its domestic and regional subsidiary, UNI Air, operates a medium and short-haul network to destinations within the country of Taiwan, Macau as well as China with its main hub in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 

EVA Air operates a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing aircraft, with Airbus A330, Airbus A321, Boeing 777, Boeing 787, and ATR 72 (operated by UNI Air) airliners primarily used on passenger routes, along with Boeing 777 freighter aircraft used on cargo routes. The airline was the first carrier to introduce the Premium Economy class (previously called &quot;Elite Class&quot; by EVA Air), which it debuted in 1991.

==History==
===Launch===
In September 1988, during the 20th anniversary celebration of Evergreen Marine Corporation&#x27;s founding, company chairman Chang Yung-fa announced his company&#x27;s intentions to establish Taiwan&#x27;s first private international airline. The opportunity to create a major Taiwanese airline had just arisen following a decision by the Taiwanese government to liberalise the country&#x27;s air transportation system. At this time, the government still required global experience and financial capital requirements for any company seeking permission to initiate international airline service from Taiwan.

Upon receipt of regulatory approval, EVA Airways Corporation was formally established in March 1989. The airline was originally to be called Evergreen Airways, however this was deemed too similar to the unrelated Evergreen International cargo airline. In October 1989, the newly formed EVA Airways Corporation placed a US$3.6 billion order for 26 aircraft from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, including Boeing 747-400 and MD-11 airliners.

Operations began on 1 July 1991 with a small fleet of Boeing 767-300ER aircraft featuring business and economy class seating. Initial destinations from Taipei were Bangkok, Seoul, Jakarta, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. These 767s were initially painted slightly different to the standard livery adopted in 1992. By the end of the year, the EVA Air network had expanded to include additional cities in East Asia and its first European destination, Vienna. First year revenues reached US$40 million.

===Expansion in the 1990s===
In 1992, EVA Air received the first of its Boeing 747-400 aircraft on order, and launched its premium economy class, &quot;Economy Deluxe&quot;, on its 747 transpacific flights to Los Angeles, beginning in December of that year. EVA Air&#x27;s premium economy cabin was the first in the world featured a wider 2-4-2 abreast configuration, legrests, individual seatback video, and enhanced meal services. EVA Air&#x27;s Economy Deluxe cabin (later renamed &quot;Evergreen Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Elite Class&quot;) proved popular with the traveling public. For international services, EVA Air&#x27;s 747s were configured with 104 premium economy seats as part of a 370-seat, four-class cabin, in addition to first, business and economy classes. In 1993, EVA Air added flights to Seattle, New York, Bangkok and Vienna with the Boeing 747-400.

By 1994, EVA Air was providing regular service to 22 destinations worldwide, and carrying over 3 million passengers annually. In 1995, the airline posted its first profit on revenues of US$1.05 billion, one year ahead of schedule. Internationally, EVA Air&#x27;s rapid expansion and increased passenger volume was boosted by its safety record, in contrast to its primary competitor, China Airlines. In addition to receiving IOSA (IATA Operational Safety Audit) certification, EVA Air in 1997 achieved simultaneous official ISO 9002 certification in the areas of Passenger, Cargo, and Maintenance Services.

Dedicated EVA Air Cargo operations began in April 1995, with the first weekly McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter flights to Taipei, Singapore, Penang, San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. EVA Air Cargo&#x27;s fleet was expanded to five freighters by the end of the year. Previously, EVA Air Cargo operations mainly relied on passenger aircraft cargo space.

In the mid-1990s, EVA Air expanded into the domestic Taiwan market by acquiring shares in Makung International Airlines, followed by Great China Airlines and Taiwan Airways. On 1 July 1998, all three carriers, as well as EVA&#x27;s existing domestic operations, merged under the UNI Air title. UNI Air became EVA Air&#x27;s domestic intra-Taiwanese subsidiary, operating short haul flights out of its base in Kaohsiung, Taiwan&#x27;s southern port and second-largest city.

===Maturation in the early 2000s===
In 2000, EVA Air embarked on its first major long-haul fleet renewal. The airline became one of the launch customers for the Boeing 777-300ER, ordering four aircraft plus eight options. At the same time, the airline placed three orders for the Boeing 777-200LR. In January 2001, EVA Air ordered its first Airbus aircraft, the A330-200. The Boeing 777 aircraft were intended for United States and European services, while the Airbus A330 aircraft were intended for regional Asian routes.

In 2001, EVA Air began listing public stock offerings on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Initially, one percent of the company&#x27;s shares was offered over-the-counter, with one-quarter held by parent company Evergreen Marine Corporation and EVA Air employees, respectively. In 2002, EVA Air underwent internal corporate reforms, with staff reductions and streamlined management. This culminated a process which had begun in 1997, when the Asian financial crisis began affecting profitability. The 2002–2003 SARS contagion also affected passenger traffic for medium-haul flights in Southeast Asia, while long-haul flights to North America, Japan, and Europe were less affected.

In 2004, EVA Air converted its remaining eight options for Boeing 777-300ERs into firm orders. The first Boeing 777-300ER entered service as EVA Air&#x27;s new flagship aircraft in July 2005. With the arrival of its new Boeing 777s, EVA Air launched a comprehensive revamp of its cabins, introducing lie-flat seats in its new Premium Laurel business class cabin, and upgrading its premium economy product to the new Elite Class cabin. The airline&#x27;s A330s were introduced with two-class Premium Laurel and Economy cabins. In December 2005, EVA Air and its associated divisions had 5,098 employees, and the airline&#x27;s network spanned 40 passenger destinations worldwide, with additional cargo destinations.

===Repositioning in the late 2000s===
In 2007, EVA Air announced a nonstop Taipei to New York (Newark Liberty International Airport) service, to be operated with its new long-range Boeing 777-300ERs. At the same time, the airline withdrew passenger service from Taipei to Paris. On 31 October 2008, EVA Air announced a resumption of Taipei to Paris service with twice-weekly passenger flights beginning 21 January 2009. In 2008, the airline also announced the suspension of services to Auckland. The carrier also prepared to increase direct flights to China, after initiating weekly charter flights in July 2008 following changes to the Three Links travel agreements.

For the 2007–2008 period, EVA Air coped with a 34% surge in fuel prices, which contributed to a US$61.2 million 2007 loss. In August 2008, EVA Air reported a second quarterly loss due to increased fuel costs. In response, the airline implemented cost-saving measures, including flight schedule reductions and fee increases. In early 2008, EVA Air&#x27;s business office in El Segundo, California, announced a major staff reduction, with over half the staff advised that they would no longer be employed by May 2008. Functions performed by those local staff were shifted to Taiwan by half, such as the reservation center.

EVA Air carried 6.2 million passengers in 2007, and employed 4,800 staff members as of April 2008. The carrier returned to profitability in the first quarter of 2009, with a US$5.9 million net gain. In August 2010, EVA Air was named one of the top 10 international airlines in &quot;Travel+Leisure&quot;&#x27;s World&#x27;s Best Awards.

===Further expansion in the early 2010s===

In March 2010, EVA Air began services to Toronto. In November 2010, EVA Air began nonstop flights connecting the inner-city Taipei Songshan and Tokyo Haneda airports. In 2010, Chang Kuo-wei, son of Chang Yung-fa, returned to serve as EVA Air&#x27;s president, and the carrier recorded increased sales and yearly profits. In early 2011, the carrier announced that it had applied for airline alliance membership with Star Alliance, and later that year clarified that it was in talks to join either Oneworld or Star Alliance by 2013. In June 2011, the carrier began nonstop flights from Taipei to Guam, and, in October 2011, the carrier announced nonstop service from New York (JFK) to Taipei.

On 27 March 2012, EVA Air announced that it would join Star Alliance in 2013. On 24 September 2012, EVA Air signed a partnership with Amadeus IT Group Altéa suite for its Altéa Revenue Management system. On 18 June 2013, EVA Air became a full member of Star Alliance.

In October 2014, EVA Air announced its intention to expand its North American network by adding new routes to Houston in 2015 and Chicago in 2016, along with expanding 55 flights per week to 63 flights per week to North America.

In October 2015, EVA Air announced its intent to purchase up to 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and two additional 777-300ER (Extended Range) jetliners from Boeing. EVA Airways joined the 787-10 launch customer team.

===Recent developments===

In November 2015, EVA Air unveiled a new livery on its Boeing 777-300ER. In January 2016, Evergreen Group chairman Chang Yung-fa died, leaving control of the company to his son by his second marriage, Chang Kuo-Wei. In March 2016, a coup by the three children of Chang Yung-fa&#x27;s first marriage removed Chang Kuo-Wei as chairman and replaced him with Lin Pang-Shui (Steven Lin). Chang Kuo-Wei later established a new airline separate from EVA Air, called Starlux Airlines.

In June 2016, EVA Air was one of eleven airlines to be given a Skytrax 5-star rating. On 24 August 2017, EVA Air unveiled its third-generation uniform, designed by fashion house Shiatzy Chen. Those new uniforms were rolled out in November 2017, replacing the second generation uniform that was introduced in 2003.

On 2 October 2018, EVA Air took delivery of its first of four Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners. The airline has orders for 20 787-10s and options for six more. In June 2019, EVA Air took delivery of its first of twenty Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners.

==Corporate affairs and identity==
===Business trends===
The key trends of EVA Air are (as at the financial year ending December 31):

===Management===
As of 2011, EVA Air&#x27;s corporate leadership is headed by Chairman Lin Bou-shiu and President Cheng Chuan-yi. EVA Air&#x27;s president plays a primary role in managing EVA&#x27;s business operations. Other members of EVA Air&#x27;s board manage support and service services of the company, including its catering and maintenance divisions. Related areas outside EVA Air&#x27;s direct management include UNI Holidays, Evergreen&#x27;s Evasión travel service and Evergreen Laurel Hotels. EVA Air has its headquarters, known as the EVA Air Building, in Luzhu, Taoyuan City.

EVA Air is largely privately owned. Primary shareholders are Evergreen Marine Corporation (20%), Evergreen founder Chang Yung-fa (15%), and Evergreen International Corporation (11%). Foreign investors and individual stockholders combined hold 28% of EVA Air shares.

===Cultural details===
EVA Air has differentiated its onboard service by using Taiwanese (Hokkien), Mandarin, Hakka, English, and other languages for its in-flight cabin announcements. The order of Hokkien and Mandarin has varied since the carrier&#x27;s launch. EVA Air has also used Taiwanese folk songs in its boarding music, including an orchestral form of &quot;Longing for Spring Wind&quot; performed by the Evergreen Group&#x27;s Evergreen Symphony Orchestra. The carrier&#x27;s aircraft and employee color scheme has at times been interpreted by observers as support for the Pan-Green Coalition of Taiwanese politics, mainly due to Evergreen founder Chang Yung-fa&#x27;s political views in the 2000 presidential election, but this association changed following Chang&#x27;s support of the Pan-Blue Coalition in the 2004 presidential election. The carrier has further abstained from displaying official markings of Taiwan on its aircraft, and received expedited approval of international landing rights as a result.

===Branding===
====Name and logo====
The name &quot;EVA&quot; was taken from two letters of &quot;Evergreen&quot; and the first letter of &quot;Airways.&quot; The name &quot;EVA&quot; is always spelled in capital letters and is pronounced &quot;E-V-A&quot;. However, the ICAO callsign is pronounced “Eva”. The airline uses the logo of its parent company, using green with an orange trim. The orange trim was removed on the current logo.

====Livery and uniforms====
The standard EVA Air livery utilizes dark green, signifying durability, and orange, representing technological innovation. Originally, both the globe and background behind the globe were painted a respective shade of green on their initial 767-300ERs in 1991. This was later changed to the first standard scheme on all other aircraft. The tail globe logo is intended to represent stability and reliability, and its positioning on the tail, with one corner off the edge, represents service innovation. The first standard EVA Air livery was updated in 2002, adding a larger typeface and the use of green covering the aircraft below the window line. The tail design and logo remained unchanged. In late 2015, EVA Air redesigned the livery and tail logo, using the dark green color on the belly, and cancelled the orange line on the edge of the tail to highlight the corporate identity.

Since 2003, EVA Air has adopted its current uniform, featuring dark green dresses with cropped jackets. Chief pursers are distinguished by orange highlights, gold bands, and orange stripes; flight attendants feature green trim and white stripes. The current uniform replaced the former green-and-orange necktie ensembles used in EVA Air&#x27;s first twelve years.

====Marketing slogans====
EVA Air has used different slogans throughout its operational history. The first slogan appeared on English language advertising in the United States, while the 1996 and 2003 versions were introduced internationally in both English and Mandarin. In 2005, a second &quot;Sharing the world&quot; slogan was introduced to complement the arrival of the airline&#x27;s Boeing 777s. EVA Air slogans have been as follows:
* Flying into the Future (2016–present)

===Divisions===
====EVA Air Cargo====
Founded concurrently with the passenger operations of EVA Air, EVA Air Cargo operates facilities in Europe, Asia, and North America. Its cargo operations have diversified to include transportation of high-tech equipment and special care items such as museum artwork and live zoological specimens. EVA Air has stated its goal of achieving a 50/50 split in revenues between its passenger and cargo operations. The airline&#x27;s cargo operations are mainly operated via a fleet of Boeing 747-400, MD-11 dedicated freighters, Boeing 747-400 Combi aircraft, and additional belly cargo space on passenger aircraft.

Following the establishment of its A330 fleet and the introduction of Boeing 777 long-haul aircraft, the airline converted some of its older Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft to freighters to meet cargo market demands. EVA Air Cargo established its European Cargo Center in Brussels in 2003 and opened its Southern China Cargo Center in Hong Kong in 2006.

As of 2007, EVA Air Cargo had 43 weekly cargo flights to London, Vienna, Brussels and US destinations including Los Angeles, Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago, Atlanta and New York. The carrier also has code-shares with international airlines including Air Nippon (a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways), British Airways World Cargo, Austrian Airlines and Lufthansa Cargo.

In recent years, the airline has focused its North American cargo operations solely on point-to-point routes. By 2004, EVA Air Cargo ranked among the world&#x27;s top 10 largest air freight companies. Industry publication &quot;Air Cargo World&quot; ranked EVA Air Cargo sixth out of 50 in its 2008 Air Cargo Excellence Survey, a measure of cargo service customer service and performance. In 2008, EVA Air handled the transport of two Chinese pandas, donated as a gift to the Taipei Zoo.

====Maintenance and support====

EVA Air service divisions further include pilot and cabin attendant training facilities, along with its Evergreen Sky Catering and Evergreen Airline Services ground support divisions. EVA Air has partnered with General Electric since 1998 to operate the Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation (EGAT), a heavy maintenance and aircraft overhaul service. Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation provides safety, repair, and refit services for EVA Air, other airlines&#x27; aircraft, and has handled the modification of four Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter aircraft for Boeing&#x27;s 787 Dreamliner production program.

==Destinations==

Most EVA Air flights originate out of Taoyuan International Airport, its main hub near Taipei, Taiwan. At Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air&#x27;s flight operations are concentrated in Terminal 2. Additionally, EVA Air and its domestic subsidiary UNI Air operate numerous flights out of Kaohsiung International Airport. A focus city for EVA Air outside of Taiwan is Bangkok, (its main hub being Suvarnabhumi Airport), with westerly connections to all its European destinations except for Paris, Munich, and Milan which are flown non-stop. Vienna is served both non-stop from Taipei and via Bangkok.

Through the mid-2000s, EVA Air&#x27;s route network was affected by the political status of Taiwan, which has historically limited access for Taiwanese airlines to Europe and certain Asian countries. Because Taiwanese carriers did not have direct access to China, EVA Air has used Hong Kong, Bangkok and Macau as interline destinations. EVA Air operated regular charter flights to China in 2008. The airline began regularly scheduled, direct cross-strait operations in December 2008, following the restoration of direct travel links.

A Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) route was opened in June 2015, and service to Chicago (O&#x27;Hare International Airport) began on 2 November 2016, using a 777-300ER, as part of a planned increase in North American flights from 58 flights to 77 flights a week.

EVA Air launched a new year-round service to Istanbul on 5 March 2016, operating 777-300ER aircraft. This route was first downgraded to a seasonal frequency and then cancelled altogether by September 2016. EVA Air also launched daily service to Cebu, Philippines on 27 March 2016 using A321-200 aircraft. Furthermore, EVA Air expanded its Southeast Asian services by offering daily flights to Chiang Mai on 1 July 2018.

In November 2024, EVA Air president Clay Sun revealed that the airline will commence flight from Taipei to Dallas beginning 3 November 2025. Dallas will be the airline&#x27;s 7th destination in the United States after Houston, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle and San Francisco. This will also mark Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, to be the fifth Asian city to service nonstop route to Dallas-Fort Worth after Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and Shanghai.

===Special liveries===
In October 2005, EVA Air launched a campaign with Japanese company Sanrio to create the &quot;Hello Kitty Jet,&quot; featuring the popular Japanese character. Using the airline&#x27;s A330-200, the exterior adopted a livery of Hello Kitty characters. A year later, the airline launched a second Hello Kitty Jet. The aircraft featured a Hello Kitty motif on exterior and interior furnishings and features. Both aircraft were used to serve Japanese destinations, and from mid–July 2007, also Taipei-Hong Kong routes. The original Hello Kitty livery was retired in 2009, but in 2011 EVA Air announced its return in redesigned form to mark the carrier&#x27;s 20th anniversary and renew interest in Japanese tourism. For this occasion, EVA Air had ordered brand-new Airbus A330-300s to be painted in an all-new Hello Kitty livery, which the first three were the &quot;Hello Kitty with Magic Stars&quot;, &quot;Hello Kitty Loves Apples&quot;, and &quot;Hello Kitty Around the World&quot;.

After the introduction of the &quot;refreshed&quot; Hello Kitty Livery on three EVA Air A330s, EVA Air decided to introduce two additional Hello Kitty A330 jets, launched in May and June 2012. The fourth and fifth Hello Kitty jets are known as &quot;Hello Kitty Speed Puff&quot; and &quot;Hello Kitty Happy Music&quot; respectively. In 2013, the carrier rolled out its sixth Hello Kitty jet &quot;Hand in Hand&quot;, this time on a Boeing 777-300ER, until it was repainted into the new EVA Air livery in May 2021. The aircraft featured all the main characters from the Sanrio family. In 2015, the seventh and final Hello Kitty jet, Kikilala-themed &quot;Shining Star&quot; Boeing 777-300ER, rolled out, until it was re-themed into &quot;Besties&quot;.

In 2017, the first three of the Hello Kitty jets, &quot;Hello Kitty with Magic Stars&quot;, &quot;Hello Kitty Loves Apples&quot;, and &quot;Hello Kitty Around the World&quot; were re-themed into &quot;Bad Badtz-Maru Travel Fun&quot;, &quot;Joyful Dream&quot;, and &quot;Celebration Flight&quot; respectively. At the same time, the Gudetama &quot;Comfort Flight&quot; were added onto the A321, and the &quot;Hello Kitty Speed Puff&quot; and &quot;Hello Kitty Happy Music&quot; were phased out.

In November 2024, an Airbus A321-200 was painted in the Hello Kitty &quot; Pinky&quot; jet.

In July 2006, EVA Air&#x27;s third new Boeing 777-300ER was Boeing&#x27;s center stage at the 2006 Farnborough Airshow in a static display. The aircraft, with its special 777-300ER &quot;Rainbow&quot; livery, was leased by Boeing for a week to be presented at the show. The first three EVA Air Boeing 777 aircraft featured this livery, which were repainted in 2013 (B-16701 in Star Alliance livery, B-16702 in regular livery, B-16703 in Hello Kitty &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; livery, which has been repainted to the standard livery in 2021).

For the 2010 Taipei International Flora Exposition, EVA Air debuted a floral-inspired design for its A330-200 aircraft, highlighting the carrier&#x27;s official sponsorship of the event; the &quot;Flora Expo cabin concept&quot; introduced interior products such as in-flight meals with a flower motif.

===Fleet plans===
The majority of EVA Air&#x27;s long-haul fleet is based on the Boeing 777-300ER, with the carrier&#x27;s initial order for 15 all delivered by 2011. In 2006, the airline decided against proceeding with an order for two Boeing 777-200LR (stating that with the 777-300ERs would give it sufficient passenger capacity), and they were converted into orders for two 777-200F cargo aircraft. In late 2010, EVA Air indicated it planned to lease three A330-300 aircraft for Asian routes in 2011. In mid-2011, EVA Air announced plans to acquire further 777-300ERs to complete the replacement of its 747-400 aircraft on Europe and US routes, along with A321 series narrow-body jets to replace its MD-90 fleet. On 8 May 2012, EVA Air signed orders with Boeing for three additional 777-300ERs, and also announced a lease of four more 777-300ERs. Due to falling freight demand, the airline restructured its cargo fleet by retiring its McDonnell Douglas MD-11s. The last 747-400M flight was conducted on 5 January 2015, ending its 22-year service.

At the Paris Airshow in 2015, EVA Air announced its intention to purchase five Boeing 777F cargo aircraft and four Airbus A330-300s. EVA Air confirmed the order of up to 24 Boeing 787-10s and two additional Boeing 777-300ERs. It also announced the additional lease of 787 aircraft.

EVA announced in late 2015 that it would be retiring all of its leased A330-200 aircraft by the end of 2016, replacing them with the newly ordered A330-300s.

Following the changes of air traffic demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the airline switched 7 787-10s with 4 787-9s and 3 777Fs. Regarding the replacement of the 777-300ER passenger aircraft, the airline ordered 18 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft in November 2023 to replace the first batch models (those built between 2005 and 2010), three of which would be converted to freighters under EVA Air Cargo to supplement the 777-200F. The later batch models (those built between 2014 and 2017) can be replaced with either the 777-9 or additional A350-1000 orders. As with the older Airbus fleet, 15 A321neos are ordered from Airbus to replace the older A321&#x27;s, while the A330s are planned to be replaced by further 787 orders by 2029.

===747 retirements===
As the 777s continued to phase in, the 747s were progressively retired. On 5 January 2015, EVA Air retired its first 747 variant, the 747-400M Combi. In 2016, EVA announced that the last 747-400 passenger service would be mid-May 2017. The airline also plans to retire the 747 freighters when the 777 freighters are delivered. EVA retired the Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft from its fleet on 21 August 2017. The following year, the production 747 freighters were retired, leaving the converted 747 freighters in service until 2019.

==Services==

Hello Kitty Flights
EVA Air operated Hello Kitty-themed flights from 2005 to 2008, and reintroduced them in 2011. These flights have since become a popular feature of their service, with some routes experiencing high passenger load factors, typically around 85%.

===Check-in===

At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air has introduced the EVA Air Check-in Kiosks at T2, counters 6A, allowing passengers to check in and print their boarding passes electronically, since December 2009. The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, passengers checking in for an EVA Air flight would have to go to an airline representative at the counters.

===Onboard===
EVA Air offers three classes of service on its long-haul flights: &quot;Royal Laurel&quot;/&quot;Premium Laurel&quot; (business), Premium Economy Class, and Economy Class. All cabins feature satellite phones, audio video on demand (AVOD) entertainment, SMS service, and in a number of Boeing 777 cabins, mood lighting (B-16718-B-16738). Domestic and short-haul international services flown also feature a short-haul business class.

In the latter half of 2007, EVA Air&#x27;s Boeing 747-400 fleet was upgraded to feature the airline&#x27;s latest seating classes; the addition of Premium Laurel class on the Boeing 747-400 succeeded the previous &quot;Super First&quot; and &quot;Super Business&quot; cabins. In early 2012, EVA Air officials unveiled a redesigned &quot;Royal Laurel&quot; business class, including 180-degree, fully flat seats in reverse herringbone layout, which was first introduced on Boeing 777-300ER services in June 2012 between Taipei and New York.

====Cabin classes====

EVA Air currently has five classes. In May 2012, EVA Air announced the introduction of a new business class on select, redesigned Boeing 777-300ER aircraft: Royal Laurel Class. The cabin features 38 lie-flat bed/seats in a reverse herringbone configuration pitched at wide. Laptop power and multi-port connectors (USB/iPod) are available at each seat. The Royal Laurel class seating arrangement is in a 1–2–1 abreast arrangement. The airline is offering this cabin on all flights operated by the Boeing 777. On 20 September 2018, EVA Air debuted the Boeing 787 Royal Laurel Class. The seat was designed by Designworks, a BMW Group company. The new Royal Laurel Class seats are 584 mm (23 in) wide and recline into flat-bed positions that have a pitch of 1,930 mm (76 in) long. There are 26 Royal Laurel Class seats on the Boeing 787-9. The Royal Laurel Class cabin on the Boeing 787-10 features 40 seats.

Premium Laurel Class, EVA Air&#x27;s existing business class cabin, was introduced in 2003 with the A330-200, and expanded to more destinations with the Boeing 777-300ER in 2005 and refitted Boeing 747-400 (replacing &quot;Super First&quot;) in 2007. Seats are pitched at in Premium Laurel in a pod-style layout, and can convert to an angled lie-flat bed. Laptop power is available.
Premium Laurel class seating is in a 2–2–2 abreast arrangement on the A330. In 2016, Premium Laurel was upgraded to the new B/E Aerospace seats in a 2-2-2 configuration.

Business Class, EVA Air&#x27;s short haul business class cabin on the A321, consists of eight seats. These seats feature a 10.6-inch in-flight entertainment system and 110 V power outlets. Seat pitch is 45 inches.

Premium Economy Class has wider seating and legroom (in a 2-4-2 layout), and a seat similar to short-haul business class with a footrest, pitch, adjustable winged headrests, and laptop power. Service levels in Premium Economy Class are similar to Economy Class, but food and amenities are improved, along with the seating. Premium Economy passengers further receive an amenity kit on most flights. There are two or four lavatories (dependent on aircraft configuration) that are dedicated to Premium Economy Class passengers.

Economy Class is available on all EVA Air aircraft, featuring pitch, touchscreen personal entertainment screens, sliding seat cushions, and adjustable winged headrests. Each seat is also equipped with a personal handset satellite telephone which can be used with a credit card. Economy seating is in 3–3–3 arrangement on the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, 3–4–3 on certain Boeing 777 aircraft, 3–3 on the A321, and 2–4–2 on all A330s. In Economy Class of the A321 there is no personal entertainment, with only overhead screens.

A new Economy and Premium Economy cabin is available on 777-300ER aircraft. Those new seats have improved entertainment systems and USB and 110 V AC ports in each seat. It includes a seat-back screen that is 11.1 inches, compared to the previous 9 inches. 
In 2018, EVA Air renamed Elite Class to Premium Economy Class.

====In-flight entertainment====
EVA Air&#x27;s audio video on demand (AVOD) entertainment system, Star Gallery, is available in all classes, except Airbus A321 Economy class. This system has 40 movies and short features, interactive games, and over 100 music albums. Programs are mainly in Mandarin and English, with some selections in Japanese, German, and French.

Star Gallery entertainment categories include such areas as Sky Hollywood (films), Sky Concert Hall (music and playlist creator), Kids&#x27; World (entertainment geared toward younger travelers), among others. The Panasonic Avionics 3000i system can display Mandarin, English, or Japanese text. On certain aircraft, a Panasonic EX3 system is installed. Since 2005, customers can also send SMS text messages and emails to the ground using their personal handsets and seatback screens.
Seatback video is not available in Economy Class on A321-200s.

&quot;enVoyage&quot; is EVA&#x27;s inflight magazine and features articles in English, Mandarin and Japanese. EVA Air&#x27;s duty-free shopping brochure, named EVA Air Sky Shop, is included at each seat in either paper or video form, with sales occurring in-flight, typically after meal services. EVA Air also stocks a supply of newspapers and magazine publications on international flights, selection depending on route.

====Catering====
EVA Air offers a variety of meals on intercontinental routes, depending on seat class, destination, and flight length. Western and Eastern menu selections are typically offered, including seasonal menu selections varied by destination. Special meal offerings can be requested in each class during booking, including children&#x27;s, religious, vegetarian, and other meals.

* 16 December 2016: EVA Air Flight 015, a Boeing 777-300ER (registered as B-16726) from Los Angeles International Airport to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport narrowly missed colliding with Air Canada Flight 788 on takeoff, and subsequently nearly impacted Mount Wilson above Pasadena. With takeoffs that evening rerouted to the rarely used eastbound departure due to weather, the Los Angeles air traffic controller mistakenly told the pilot to turn left instead of right (as they would if the aircraft were taking off westbound, over the ocean). The aircraft complied, and instead headed north, climbing to as it headed towards Mt. Wilson. The EVA aircraft was forced to take evasive action, and climb to , missing Mt. Wilson by less than . Air Canada Flight 788, also departing Los Angeles, was taking the same route as the EVA aircraft and was forced to climb to in evasive action.
* 2 December 2017: EVA Air Flight 035, a Boeing 777-300ER (registered as B-16718) was taxiing for departure at Toronto Pearson International Airport, struck a pole while taxiing in darkness. The aircraft suffered significant damage on its right leading edge and wing surface. The aircraft had not been taxiing on the centerline after deicing and therefore lacked wing clearance with the light pole. The flight was then cancelled.
* 10 June 2023: EVA Air Flight 189 from Taipei Songshan Airport, an Airbus A330-300 (registered as B-16340) heading to Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan struck the wing of Thai Airways International Flight 683, also an Airbus A330-300 (registered as HS-TEO, named &quot;Chutamat&quot;), which was to depart for Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport. The Thai Airways aircraft reportedly sustained minor damage, losing part of its wing as a result of the collision. The collision forced one of the runways of Haneda to close.

== Controversies and labor disputes ==
* On 29 January 2019, a female EVA Air flight attendant issued a public complaint after EVA Air falsely accused her of taking part in pornography.
* On 20 June 2019, Taiwan Flight Attendants Union (TFAU) started an air strike. EVA Air and Taiwan Flight Attendants reached an agreement on 7 July 2019, stating that the strike would end on 10 July 2019. About 1440 flights were cancelled and more than 280,000 passengers were affected from the air strike. The strike became the longest strike in Taiwan&#x27;s history. The airline estimated a prospective loss of about US$97 million as a result of the strike.

<text>The Chevrolet Biscayne was a series of full-size cars produced by the American manufacturer General Motors through its Chevrolet division between 1958 and 1975. Named after a show car displayed at the 1955 General Motors Motorama, the Biscayne was the least expensive model in the Chevrolet full-size car range (except the 1958-only Chevrolet Delray). The absence of most exterior and fancy interior trimmings remained through the life of the series, as the slightly costlier Chevrolet Bel Air offered more interior and exterior features at a price significantly lower than the top-of-the-line Impala and Caprice.

The Biscayne was named after Biscayne Bay, near Miami, Florida, following a trend by Chevrolet at the time to name cars after coastal cities or beaches such as the Bel Air and the later Chevrolet Malibu.

==Overview==

The first use of the Biscayne name by Chevrolet was on the 1955 Biscayne XP-37 concept car built for the General Motors Motorama.

Biscaynes were produced primarily for the fleet market, though they were also available to the general public — particularly to those who wanted low-cost, no-frills transportation with the convenience, room and power of a full-size automobile. While most Biscaynes were sold with a six-cylinder engine through the late 1960s, the V8 engine became the more popular powerplant by the early 1970s. The Biscayne was usually built as a two- or four-door sedan, although a four-door station wagon was available between 1962 and 1968 (and again after 1973 in Canada only). A low-priced, full-size Biscayne station wagon equivalent was available as the Chevrolet Brookwood both before and after this period. The two-door sedan was dropped after 1969, and consequently, from 1970 to 1972 the only Biscayne model available was a four-door sedan. In 1958, the Delray was priced below the Biscayne but was discontinued the following year.

Many of the luxury convenience options available on the more expensive full-sized Chevrolet models, such as power windows, were not available on the Biscayne. However, customers could purchase a Biscayne with any of Chevrolet&#x27;s high-output big-block V8 engines and performance-oriented transmissions, including the floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission with Hurst shifter and low-ratio final drive. Original production numbers of cars built this way were very low, and examples of these high-performance cars are highly sought after by collectors today. Notably, Baldwin Chevrolet of Long Island, New York, became famous for offering the &quot;Street Racer Special,&quot; a 1968 Biscayne coupe with dealer-fitted high-performance 427 cubic-inch V8, and heavy-duty suspension components, turning the Biscayne into a serious drag car. Biscayne with high-performance equipment was often nicknamed &quot;Bisquick&quot; by enthusiasts.

Like the slightly upscale Bel Airs, Biscaynes are easily identified by the use of two taillights per side; the only exceptions to this were in 1959 and 1972. The more expensive Impalas (and later Caprices) have three taillights per side. The Biscayne was largely devoid of exterior chrome trim and was normally fitted with small hubcaps, though several exterior trim pieces and upgraded wheel covers were available at extra cost. Interior trim was spartan, with lower-grade cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery trim, a standard steering wheel with centre horn button, and rubber floor mats. Slight upgrades were made throughout the life of the series — for instance, the 1964 models came standard with deluxe steering wheels with horn rings, deep-twist carpeting and foam-cushioned front seats.

==First generation (1958)==

At its introduction for the 1958 model year, the Biscayne was available as a two- or four-door pillared sedan. In 1958, there was also the even lower-priced Chevrolet Delray, but this was discontinued for 1959. There was a 2-door Delray Utility Sedan offered in 1958, which substituted a platform for the rear seating area. This was described, but not pictured, in the dealer brochure.

==Second generation (1959–1960)==

In 1959, the car was redesigned, and now sat on an inch-and-a-half () longer wheelbase. In 1959 the two-door Utility Sedan appeared, a version lacking a rear seat and being intended as a delivery vehicle. In total, there was 2 different body styles, 2-door sedan and 4-door sedan. The Chevrolet Biscayne had a price of $2,365, the entry level Biscayne Fleet Master had a price of $2,295 and the top level Impala had a price of $2,772.

1960 Chevy Biscayne were used as presidential vehicle in South Korea.

===Biscayne Fleetmaster===
In 1960, a lower-priced, sparsely trimmed version of the Biscayne called the Fleetmaster was produced. Aimed primarily at the fleet market, the Fleetmaster included a lower grade of upholstery than the standard Biscayne and deleted routine convenience items, such as a cigarette lighter, door armrests, and passenger-side sun visor. In addition, many parts were painted rather than chrome plated. Both two- and four-door sedans were available.

A number of economy-minded options were available exclusive to the Fleetmaster model, although the performance-oriented engines and transmissions were also available (for police applications or performance-oriented customers who wanted the lightest car possible). The Fleetmaster was dropped after 1961. Under 5,000 of them were made.

==Third generation (1961–1964)==
The Biscayne underwent a full model change for the 1961 model year. The stripped down Fleetmaster and the three-passenger Utility Sedan were still available for 1961 but sold in very small numbers. Series numbers were 1100 and 1200 (six- and eight-cylinder Biscayne), with the 1300 and 1400 used for the six- and eight-cylinder Fleetmaster. For 1963, the short-stroke Turbo-Thrift inline-six replaced the earlier &quot;Stovebolt&quot; 235, meaning lower weight and a slight gain in power.

In 1962, a four-door station wagon version appeared, replacing the earlier Brookwood model. As usual, the full range of GM&#x27;s full-size engine and transmission options were available to the low priced Biscayne. A very few of the brand-new, high-powered 409 V8s (of which only 142 were built in 1961) even found their way into the bargain-basement Biscayne Fleetmaster, with the direct intention of being used for drag racing.

==Fourth generation (1965–1970)==
The all-new 1965 Biscayne was larger yet, and offered an even wider range of engines, including a new, larger 250-ci inline-six. For the 1967 model year the smaller 230 was dropped. For 1966 the top engine became the new Big-Block 427 ci V8, available in a high-powered, high-revving version with solid lifters. Although not available for the big Chevrolets in 1967, it returned in 1968 for two more model years. For 1969 Chevrolet reverted to separate series names for station wagons and what had been the Biscayne wagon became the Brookwood. Power steering and power brakes were made standard for the 1970 model year. The 1967 Chevrolet Biscayne 2-door sedan with a 427 under the hood and a 3-speed manual did 0-60 mph in 6.1 seconds, and the quarter mile in 14.6 seconds. A base model 2-door Biscayne would cost you $2,472 (the Impala was $2,728) in 1965. In 1970 a base model Biscayne would cost $2,897 (the Impala was $3,150).

==Fifth generation (1971–1975)==
The Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was made standard on all cars ordered with a V8 engine starting midway through the 1971 model year. Production of the Biscayne for the United States market ended for 1972; it was not advertised that year in Chevrolet&#x27;s brochure but was available for fleet buyers. However, the Biscayne name was still used in Canada through the 1975 model year, with a 350 cubic-inch V8 engine and Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission made standard for 1974. The station wagon model had been sold as the Brookwood, but for 1973 the Biscayne station wagon made a return for the Canadian market only. Like its stablemates, the 1975 Biscayne received new dashboard, radio and climate control graphics (including a 100-mph speedometer with kilometer equivalents) and the availability of two new options: an Econominder gauge package (with temperature gauge and a gauge that monitored fuel economy, based on the driver&#x27;s current driving habits) and intermittent windshield wipers.

The fourth generation wagons featured a &#x27;clamshell&#x27; design marketed as the &quot;Glide-away&quot; tailgate, also called a &quot;disappearing&quot; tailgate because when open, the tailgate was completely out of view. On the clamshell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor. The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate. Raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate. The power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years. Wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat — and could accommodate a 4 x 8&#x27; sheet of plywood with rear seats folded. The clamshell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open, allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without impediment of a door — for example, in a closed garage.

== Discontinuation ==
Three main factors helped kill off the Biscayne, the first being that the government wanted more fuel efficient cars, and the Biscayne was not such. The second reason being that the Chevrolet Biscayne was starting to overlap with other GM models like the Chevrolet Bel Air and the Pontiac Catalina, including prices that also overlapped. The third and final reason was money, Chevrolet was losing money to foreign imports, so Chevrolet phased out the Biscayne to put more effort into cars like the Chevrolet Vega and Chevrolet Chevette.

<text>Air Koryo () is North Korea&#x27;s flag carrier and only commercial airline. It is state-owned and controlled by the North Korean air force. Headquartered in Sunan-guyŏk, Pyongyang, it operates domestic and international routeson a regular schedule only to Beijing, Shenyang, and Vladivostokfrom its hub at Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport. It also operates flights on behalf of the North Korean government, with one of its aircraft serving as North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un&#x27;s personal plane. Its fleet consists of Ilyushin and Tupolev aircraft from the Soviet Union and Russia, and Antonovs from Ukraine.

Air Koryo’s history can be traced to the founding of the Soviet–North Korean Airline (SOKAO) in 1950. Following the Korean War, in 1955, the airline was reorganized as Korean Airways and started domestic and international routes to other communist Eastern Bloc states in Asia and Europe. Another reorganization followed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and in 1993, the airline adopted its current name, Air Koryo. Due to its aging fleet of Soviet aircraft and related safety and maintenance concerns, Air Koryo was banned in the European Union between 2006 and 2020, when it was allowed to resume operations into the EU with their newly acquired Tu-204 aircraft.

During the rule of Kim Jong Un, Air Koryo also started branching out into commercial sectors beyond aviation, such as ground transportation and consumer goods.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused Air Koryo to suspend regular operations, with no scheduled international flights between 2020 and 2023.

==History==
===Early years===

In early 1950, SOKAO (Soviet–Korean Airline, ) was established as a joint North Korean-Soviet venture to connect Pyongyang with Moscow. Regular flights began that same year. Services were suspended during the Korean War, resuming in 1953 as Bureau of Civil Aviation Ministry of Transport of DPRK. The state airline was then placed under the control of the Civil Aviation Administration of Korea (CAAK) and re-branded Korean Airways (), starting operations on 21 September 1955 with Lisunov Li-2, Antonov An-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 aircraft. Ilyushin Il-14s and Ilyushin Il-18s were added to the fleet in the 1960s.

=== Expansion ===

Jet operations commenced in 1975 when the first Tupolev Tu-154 was delivered for service from Pyongyang to Prague, East Berlin, and Moscow with refueling stops in Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, as the Tu-154 had insufficient range. Tu-134s and An-24s were also delivered to start domestic services. The Tu-154 fleet was increased at the start of the 1980s, while the first long-haul Ilyushin Il-62 was delivered back in 1979 (two of these aircraft are used in VIP configuration), allowing Korean Airways to offer a direct non-stop service to Moscow for the first time, as well as serving Sofia and Belgrade.

Alongside Soviet aircraft, North Korea also considered acquiring Concorde supersonic jets for Air Koryo under a plan by Kim Il Sung to boost the country&#x27;s international prestige. North Korea and Aérospatiale and British AerospaceConcorde&#x27;s two European manufacturerssigned a preliminary purchase agreement with the country for two Concordes in 1979, but the deal never proceeded because of North Korea&#x27;s economic challenges and Cold War tensions between East and West.

===21st century===

The end of the Cold War and the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe saw a vast reduction in the number of international services offered. Korean Airways re-branded as Air Koryo on 28 March 1992, and in 1993, ordered three Ilyushin Il-76 freight aircraft to carry cargo to and from its destinations in China and Russia.

Air Koryo purchased a Tupolev Tu-204-300 aircraft in December 2007 and another in March 2010 to replace its aging international fleet. With the Tu-204, Air Koryo would be able to fly to Europe.

Due to safety and maintenance concerns, Air Koryo was added to the list of air carriers banned in the European Union in March 2006. The European Commission found evidence of serious safety deficiencies on the part of Air Koryo during ramp inspections in France and Germany. Air Koryo persistently failed to address these issues during other subsequent ramp inspections performed by the EU under the SAFA programme, pointing to blatant systemic safety deficiencies at Air Koryo operations. The airline failed to reply to an inquiry by the French Civil Aviation Authority regarding its safety operations, pointing to a lack of transparency or communication on the part of Air Koryo. The plan by Air Koryo for corrective action, presented in response to France&#x27;s request, was found to be inadequate and insufficient. The EC also held that North Korean authorities did not adequately oversee the flag carrier, which it was obliged to do under the Chicago Convention. Therefore, on the basis of the common criteria, the Commission assessed that Air Koryo did not meet the relevant safety standards.&quot;&quot;

In September 2009, Air Koryo ordered an additional example of the Tupolev Tu-204-300 aircraft and a single Tupolev Tu-204-100. Air Koryo was to receive its first of two Tupolev Tu-204-100B aircraft fitted with 210 seats. Flights to Dalian in China were added to the Air Koryo schedule. Also, twice weekly Tu-134 flights from Pyongyang and direct services from Pyongyang to Shanghai Pudong were inaugurated with a two weekly service on JS522 and returning on JS523 in 2010.

In March 2010, Air Koryo was allowed to resume operations into the EU only with their Tu-204 aircraft, which were fitted with the necessary equipment to comply with mandatory international standards. In April 2011, Air Koryo launched its first services to Malaysia with the inauguration of flights from Pyongyang to Kuala Lumpur. The flights operated twice a week utilizing the Tu-204, but were cancelled in mid-2017 due to sanctions imposed resulting from the poisoning murder of Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur International Airport by suspected North Korean agents.

In 2011, Air Koryo also inaugurated services to Kuwait City, being operated weekly by Tu-204 aircraft. The services operate during peak travel season – April to October.

In 2012, Air Koryo resumed flights to Kuala Lumpur but ceased the service in 2014 along with its expansion into Harbin, China. In 2012, Juche Travel Services, a company operating tours to North Korea, launched &quot;aviation enthusiast&quot; tours using chartered Air Koryo aircraft, which offered visitors the chance to fly on every type of Air Koryo aircraft within North Korea, the Mil-17, An-24, Tu-134, Tu-154, and Il-62. The international services were operated by An-148, Tu-154, or Tu-204.

In 2017, during the rule of North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un, there were signs that Air Koryo was branching out into commercial sectors beyond aviation, providing goods and services as diverse as petrol stations, taxis, tobacco, soft drinks, and tinned pheasant meat.

As of 2021, two further Tupolev Tu-204-100B aircraft were allegedly prepared to be leased to Air Koryo. However, both have since been sighted with the name of Sky KG Airlines added on top of Air Koryo&#x27;s colors and have been moved to Zhukovsky International Airport by Moscow, where they remain as of November 2023. Intelligence and media reports suggest that North Korea might still be trying to acquire these two jets with Russian assistance as of November 2023.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

Air Koryo was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On 24 January 2020, the airline canceled several flights to Chinato Macao, Shanghai, and Shenyangand on 1 February canceled its two remaining international routes to Beijing and Vladivostok. International flights remained canceled through August 2023, flying anew on 22 August to Beijing and on 25 August to Vladivostok using Tu–204 aircraft.

The company flew to neighboring China to collect COVID-19-related supplies.

==Destinations==

Scheduled international services are only operated from Pyongyang to Beijing, Shenyang, and Vladivostok; additional destinations not listed on their website, but showing up elsewhere as charters or seasonal charter services are also included.

The first regular charter flights between North Korea and South Korea began in 2003. The first Air Koryo flight operated by a Tu-154 touched down at Seoul&#x27;s Incheon International Airport. Air Koryo operated 40 return services to Seoul, along with flights into Yangyang and Busan in South Korea. Inter-Korean charters from Hamhung&#x27;s Sondok Airport to Yangyang International in South Korea began in 2002. Currently, there are no inter-Korean flights, due to laws in both countries. In 2014, Air Koryo operated a series of services to Seoul Incheon International Airport with Tu-204 and An-148 aircraft for the 2014 Asian Games held in Incheon.

Air Koryo operated an airline interline partnership with Aeroflot (SkyTeam) on services radiating from Vladivostok and Pyongyang until 2017 when it was forced to close the agreement due to newly imposed sanctions.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
As of June 2024, Air Koryo operates the following fleet for international routes:
===Historic, domestic routes fleet and unknown status===

Air Koryo may have been planning to add either a Ilyushin Il-86 or Ilyushin Il-96 to its fleet, according to a 1993 timetable.

===Tupolev Tu-204===
The first Tupolev Tu-204-300 for Air Koryo was officially handed over to the carrier on 27 December 2007, and was ferried from Ulyanovsk to Pyongyang. It has been fitted out with 16 business class seats and the remaining 150 seats are economy. The Tu-204 aircraft are currently scheduled on all international flights out of Pyongyang. With the arrival of the new aircraft, a new seasonal route to Singapore was introduced and the Pyongyang-Bangkok route was resumed in 2008. Its first revenue-earning flight was made on 8 May 2008. Air Koryo operates another version of the Tu-204 jet, a Tu-204-100B, which they took delivery of on 4 March 2010. The Tu-204-300 is a shortened version of the Tu-204-100B. It started operating scheduled services on 5 March 2010. On 30 March 2010, the two Tupolev Tu-204 have been given the rights to operate into the European Union. The two Tu-204 remain the only planes the airline is allowed to operate on services to the EU.

===Gallery===
== Livery ==
The Air Koryo livery consisted of a white and grey fuselage and a horizontal stripe in national colors along the windows dividing the upper and lower parts into white and grey respectively. The Korean name Air Koryo is painted above the windows and a North Korean flag is painted on the vertical stabilizer.

Now most of their planes are painted in new livery. It consists of a full white body and grey belly which are divided with a thin red stripe. The name of the airline is painted in Korean in front and in English in the middle with the North Korean flag and registration on the vertical stabilizer.

In 2024, Air Koryo started changing its crane logo following Kim Jong Un&#x27;s announcement, at the end of 2023, that North Korea will no longer seek reunification with South Korea. The old logo was a stylized crane whose wings resembled the Korean peninsula as a unified whole, while the crane wings of the new logo consist of tapered horizontal lines that no longer resemble the peninsula.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 30 June 1979, a Korean Airways Tupolev Tu-154B sustained landing gear and wing damage at Budapest Ferihegy Airport in Hungary. On final approach to Runway 31, the pilot realised the plane would undershoot and brought the nose of the plane up without applying power. The aircraft stalled, and with a hard landing, the right landing gear collapsed, causing the right wing to strike the ground and sustain substantial wing structure damage. There were no fatalities, and aircraft P-551 was subsequently repaired and returned to service.
*On 1 July 1983, a Korean Airways Ilyushin Il-62M on a non-scheduled international passenger flight from Pyongyang, North Korea (Pyongyang Sunan International Airport) to Conakry, Guinea (Conakry International Airport) crashed in the Fouta Djallon Mountains in Guinea. All 23 people on board died, and the aircraft was written off.
*On 15 August 2006, Flight 152, a Tupolev Tu-154B (P-551) suffered a runway excursion while landing at Beijing Capital International Airport. Despite being officially retired in 2010, it was repainted and returned to service in 2013 and as of 2019 has been in storage. Previously, in 1976, this aircraft had been taxiing when it was damaged by an Aeroflot Tu-104 that lost control and crashed during takeoff.
*On 22 July 2016, Flight 151, a Tupolev Tu-204-300 on a flight from Beijing to Pyongyang, made an emergency landing at Shenyang Taoxian International Airport due to reports of smoke in the cabin. The oxygen masks were deployed.

<doc id="388198" wikidata="Q420070" url="?curid=388198" title="Sodium percarbonate">
<text>Sodium percarbonate or sodium carbonate peroxide is an inorganic compound with the formula . It is an adduct of sodium carbonate (&quot;soda ash&quot; or &quot;washing soda&quot;) and hydrogen peroxide (that is, a ). It is a colorless, crystalline, hygroscopic, and water-soluble solid. It is sometimes abbreviated as SPC. It contains 32.5% by weight of hydrogen peroxide.

The product is used in some eco-friendly bleaches and other cleaning products.

==History==
Sodium percarbonate was first prepared in 1899 by Ukrainian chemist Sebastian Moiseevich Tanatar (7 October 1849 – 30 November 1917).

==Structure==
At room temperature, solid sodium percarbonate has the orthorhombic crystal structure, with the &quot;Cmca&quot; crystallographic space group. The structure changes to &quot;Pbca&quot; as the crystals are cooled below about −30 °C.

==Chemistry==
Dissolved in water, sodium percarbonate yields a mixture of hydrogen peroxide, sodium cations (), and carbonate ().

==Production==
Sodium percarbonate is produced industrially by crystallization of a solution of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide, with attention to the pH and concentrations. This method is also convenient for the laboratory preparation. Alternatively, dry sodium carbonate may be treated directly with concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution.

World production capacity of this compound was estimated at several hundred thousand tons for 2004.

==Uses==
As an oxidizing agent, sodium percarbonate is an ingredient in a number of home and laundry cleaning products, including non-chlorine bleach products such as Oxyper, OxiClean, Tide laundry detergent, and Vanish.

Many commercial products mix a percentage of sodium percarbonate with sodium carbonate. The average &quot;Oxy&quot; product in the supermarket contains 35–40% sodium percarbonate with about 5% active oxygen when titrated.

Sodium percarbonate is also used as a cleaning agent in homebrewing.

Sodium percarbonate can be used in organic synthesis as a convenient source of anhydrous H2O2, in particular in solvents that cannot dissolve the carbonate but can leach the H2O2 out of it. A method for generating trifluoroperacetic acid &quot;in situ&quot; for use in Baeyer–Villiger oxidations from sodium percarbonate and trifluoroacetic anhydride has been reported; it provides a convenient and cheap approach to this reagent without the need to obtain highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide.

<doc id="388199" wikidata="Q353637" url="?curid=388199" title="A. H. Tammsaare">
<text>Anton Hansen (18 (O.S.)/30 January 1878 – 1 March 1940), better known by his pseudonym A. H. Tammsaare and its variants, was an Estonian writer whose pentalogy &quot;Truth and Justice&quot; (&quot;Tõde ja õigus&quot;; 1926–1933) is considered one of the major works of Estonian literature and &quot;The Estonian Novel&quot;.

== Biography ==
Tammsaare was born in Järvamaa, in the municipality of Albu, village of Vetepere, Estonia. The son of a farmer, he came from a poor background but managed to collect enough money for his education. His family was quite enlightened for the time, with his father ordering newspapers, which was something most Estonian farmers didn&#x27;t do. He studied in Väike-Maarja and Tartu at the Hugo Treffner Gymnasium, and afterward at the University of Tartu where he studied law. Tammsaare&#x27;s studies were interrupted by tuberculosis in 1911. He spent over a year in a sanatorium in Sochi – where his memorial house is open to the public – and the following six years in his brother&#x27;s farm in Koitjärve, Estonia (now part of Põhja-Kõrvemaa Nature Reserve), reading works of Cervantes, Shakespeare and Homer. His younger sister, Maria Hansen, was the mother of Tammsaare&#x27;s nephew, actor Arno Suurorg.

In 1918, when Estonia became independent, Tammsaare moved to Tallinn. It was here that Tammsaare wrote prose works based on the history and lives of the Estonian people that gained him a prominent place in Estonian literature.

Tammsaare was interested in philosophy and psychology. His novels reflect the ideas of Bergson, Jung and Freud. He was, however, skeptical about cosmopolitanism. &quot;European culture&quot; he wrote, &quot;is something to be overcome if one wishes to see the triumph of love, justice, and humanity spoken of so glibly&quot;. Like Carl Robert Jakobson and Jaan Tõnisson&#x27;s &quot;Tartu Renaissance&quot; group, he believed that Estonian culture was best served by farmers and intellectuals from rural backgrounds. His work was influenced at various stages by Oscar Wilde, Knut Hamsun and André Gide, but, above all, the Russian realists. &quot;In the whole of world literature,&quot; said Tammsaare, I have never read anything to compare to the Russians... there is no one to compare to Tolstoy, Dostoevsky or Gogol&quot;... Dostoevsky &quot;really disturbed me: I lived in a waking dream under his influence. I was especially gripped by &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;.

== Bibliography ==
Tammsaare&#x27;s early works are characterized by rural &quot;poetic&quot; realism. Some of his stories also reflect the atmosphere of the revolutionary year of 1905. During what is sometimes classified as his second period, from 1908 to 1919, he wrote several short urban novels and collections of miniatures. In &quot;Poiss ja liblikas&quot; (1915, &quot;The Boy and the Butterfly&quot;), Tammsaare shows the influence of Oscar Wilde. Internationally best known is his last novel, &quot;Devil with a False Passport&quot; (&quot;Põrgupõhja uus Vanapagan&quot;).

&quot;Truth and Justice&quot; comprises five volumes, which have no individual titles (some were added in translation).
Since vol. 3 contains a description about the Russian Revolution of 1905, which is not informed by ideology but by an existential attention to individual suffering, it was often combined with vol. 2 by Soviet censorship.

Even today, the third volume is sometimes called &quot;artistically inferior&quot;, although the description of the revolution is on par with similar scenes in Pasternak&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;. In Estonia, the second volume, with its Tartu educational scenes, is today probably the most enjoyed. International critics would probably opt for vol. 1 as the strongest overall; it is a classical peasant novel reminiscent of Hamsun which is also generally held to be the most telling one about &quot;the Estonian character&quot;, embodied especially in two antagonistic farmer figures Andres and Pearu. Tammsaare himself said later that the different volumes deal with the relation of Man (i.e., the human person) to (1) the land, (2) God, (3) State and society, (4) him- or herself and (5) resignation.

&quot;Truth and Justice&quot; was not translated into English until 2014, when Haute Culture Books published the first volume of the saga under the name &quot;Andres and Pearu&quot;. There are two complete translations into German and one each into French, Latvian, and Czech. Volume 1 has also been translated into Finnish, Polish, and Hungarian (with the title, &quot;Orcád verítékével&quot;).
