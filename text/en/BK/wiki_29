<text>Thomas Jordan (September 30, 1819 – November 27, 1895) was a Confederate general and major operative in the network of Confederate spies during the American Civil War. A career soldier in the armies of three nations, he had previously fought in the Mexican–American War, and in 1868 was appointed as chief of staff of the Cuban insurgent army, which fought to achieve independence from Spain. He resigned in 1870 and returned to the United States, where he settled in New York City. Jordan was also a newspaper editor and author, writing articles about the American Civil War.

==Early life and career==
Thomas Jordan was born the oldest child of Gabriel and Elizabeth &quot;Betsey&quot; Seibert Jordan in the Luray Valley, Virginia. He is believed to have been educated in the local schools of Shenandoah County, Virginia (later Page County, Virginia). He received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1840.

Jordan entered the army as a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Infantry, and was assigned to the garrison at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. He fought in the Second Florida War against the Seminole Indians. He was among those soldiers who surprised and captured Chief &quot;Tiger Tail&quot; near Cedar Keys in November 1842.

Jordan was assigned to western frontier duty until 1846, when he was promoted to first lieutenant. In the Mexican–American War, he served creditably at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. In 1847, he was promoted to captain and served as a quartermaster. He remained at Vera Cruz for a year after the war in an administrative role. He was next posted to various Southern garrisons and on the Pacific Coast.

As early as 1860, he secretly began a pro-Southern spy network in Washington, D.C., that was particularly active in the period immediately after secession. In early 1861, Jordan passed control of the espionage network to Rose O&#x27;Neal Greenhow; however, he continued to receive and evaluate her reports after she was restricted to house arrest in August 1861 and imprisoned in Washington, DC in January 1862. He appeared to be her Confederate Secret Service &quot;handler&quot; during the formative phase of Confederate intelligence.

==Civil War==
On May 22, 1861, Jordan resigned from the U.S. Army. He was commissioned as a captain in the fledgling Confederate army. Promotion came rapidly and by June 1861, he had become a lieutenant colonel and a staff officer, seeing duty at the First Battle of Manassas as a full colonel and chief of staff under P.G.T. Beauregard. He also was the army&#x27;s adjutant general and accompanied President Jefferson Davis on a post-battle tour of the field.

Jordan subsequently accompanied Beauregard to the Western Theater to Kentucky. During the advance from Corinth, Mississippi, into Tennessee, he rendered valuable service in preparing the men for the Battle of Shiloh, where he was conspicuous in efficiently managing the flow of orders to and from the various corps commanders and their respective staffs.

For his actions at Shiloh, he was promoted to brigadier general on April 14, 1862, and served as chief of staff for General Braxton Bragg during his Kentucky Campaign. When Beauregard was reassigned to the defense of Charleston, South Carolina, Jordan accompanied his long-time friend and mentor as chief of staff for that department. In May 1864, he was assigned to the command of the Third Military District of South Carolina.

==Postbellum==
Immediately after the Civil War, Jordan lived in Tennessee, where he published a critical review of the Confederate operations and administration in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He was the editor of the &quot;Memphis Appeal&quot; newspaper in 1866. In 1868, he co-published with J. B. Pryor a book entitled &quot;The Campaigns of Lieutenant-General Forrest.&quot;

That same year, General Jordan, with his lengthy administrative and combat experience, was appointed as chief of staff of the Cuban insurgent army. In May 1869, as General-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army, he landed at Mayarí with 300 men, and with enough arms, ammunition and supplies for the 6,000 additional men whom he hoped would rise to join the rebellion. In December 1869, Jordan became military head of the Cuban Mambi army, who were fighting for Cuban independence from Spain in the Ten Years&#x27; War. He scored a significant victory over superior enemy forces at Guaimaro in January 1870. Extremely short of supplies, Jordan resigned from his Cuban post a month later and returned to the United States, ending his long military career.

Jordan eventually settled in New York City and owned a home on Grymes Hill in Staten Island. Continuing his interest in writing, Jordan published numerous articles on the Civil War and became the editor of the &quot;Mining Record&quot;.

Jordan is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson in Westchester County, New York.

<text>The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (GSE; , BSE) is one of the largest Russian-language encyclopedias, published in the Soviet Union from 1926 to 1990. After 2002, the encyclopedia&#x27;s data was partially included into the later (or &quot;Great Russian Encyclopedia&quot;) in an updated and revised form. The GSE claimed to be &quot;the first Marxist–Leninist general-purpose encyclopedia&quot;.

==Origins==
The idea of the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; emerged in 1923 on the initiative of Otto Schmidt, a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In early 1924 Schmidt worked with a group which included Mikhail Pokrovsky, (rector of the Institute of Red Professors), Nikolai Meshcheryakov (Former head of the Glavit, the State Administration of Publishing Affairs), Valery Bryusov (poet), Veniamin Kagan (mathematician) and Konstantin Kuzminsky to draw up a proposal which was agreed to in April 1924. Also involved was Anatoly Lunacharsky, People&#x27;s Commissar of Education (Narkompros), who had previously been involved with a proposal by Alexander Bogdanov and Maxim Gorky to produce a Workers&#x27; Encyclopedia.

==Editions==
There were three editions. The first edition of 65 volumes (65,000 entries, plus a supplementary volume about the Soviet Union) was published during 1926–1947, the chief editor being Otto Schmidt (until 1941). The second edition of 50 volumes (100,000 entries, plus a supplementary volume) was published in 1950–1958; chief editors: Sergei Vavilov (until 1951) and Boris Vvedensky (until 1969); two index volumes to this edition were published in 1960. The third edition of 1969–1978 contains 30 volumes (100,000 entries, plus an index volume issued in 1981). Volume 24 is in two books, one being a full-sized book about the USSR, all with about 21 million words, and the chief editor being Alexander Prokhorov (since 1969). In the third edition, much attention was paid to the philosophical problems of natural sciences, physical and chemical sciences, and mathematical methods in various branches of knowledge.

From 1957 to 1990, the &quot;Yearbook of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; was released annually with up-to-date articles about the Soviet Union and all countries of the world.

The first online edition, an exact replica of text and graphics of the third (so-called Red) edition, was published by Rubricon.com in 2000.

==Role and purpose in Soviet society==
The foreword to the first volume of the GSE (2nd ed.) proclaims &quot;The Soviet Union has become the center of the civilized world.&quot; The &quot;GSE&quot;, along with all other books and other media and communications with the public, was directed toward the &quot;furtherance of the aims of the party and the state.&quot; The 1949 decree issued for the production of the second edition of the GSE directed:

The foreword to the &quot;GSE&quot; (3rd ed.) expanded on that mission, paying particular attention to developments in science and technology: nuclear engineering, space technology, atomic physics, polymer chemistry, and radio electronics; also detailing the history and activities of the Russian revolutionary movement, the development of the labor movement worldwide and summarizing Marxist scholarship on political economy, sociology, and political science. In support of that mission, the GSE (2nd ed.) described as the role of education:

The third edition of the &quot;GSE&quot; subsequently expanded on the role of education:

Education is essential to preparing for life and work. It is the basic means by which people come to know and acquire culture, and it is the foundation of culture&#x27;s development...The Soviet education rests on the principles of the unity of education and communist upbringing; cooperation among the school, the family, and the society in bringing up young people; and the linkage of education and training to life and the practical experience of building communism. The underlying principles of the Soviet system of public education include a scientific approach to and continual improvement of education on the basis of the latest achievements in science, technology and culture; a humanistic and highly moral orientation in education and upbringing; and co-education of both sexes, secular education which excludes the influence of religion.
Based on his extensive talks with the editors of the &quot;GSE&quot;, to whom he was granted unprecedented access, William Benton, publisher of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, wrote the following in observation of the &quot;GSE&quot;″s chief editor B. A. Vvedensky stating their compliance with the 1949 decree of the Council of Ministers:

It is just this simple for the Soviet board of editors. They are working under a government directive that orders them to orient their encyclopedia as sharply as a political tract. The encyclopedia was thus planned to provide the intellectual underpinning for the Soviet world offensive in the duel for men&#x27;s minds. The Soviet government ordered it as a fighting propaganda weapon. And the government attaches such importance to its &quot;political role&quot; that its board of editors is chosen by and is responsible only to the high Council of Ministers itself.
== Translations ==

===English===
The third edition was translated and published into English in 31 volumes between 1974 and 1983 by Macmillan Publishers. Each volume was translated separately, requiring use of the index found at the front of each volume to locate specific items; knowledge of Russian can be helpful to find the right volume the first time. Not all entries were translated into English; these are indicated in the index.

===Greek===
The third edition was translated into Greek and published in 34 volumes between 1977 and 1983 from Akadimos publishing company (owned by Giannis Giannikos), which has also translated various Soviet encyclopedias and literature. All articles that were related to Greece or Greek history, culture and society were expanded and hundreds of new ones were written especially for the Greek edition. Thus the encyclopedia contains, for example, both the Russian entry on Greece as well as a much larger one prepared by Greek contributors. Each article written especially in the Greek edition is marked with the note &quot;Greek version supplement&quot; (or &quot;Συμπλήρωμα ελληνικής έκδοσης&quot; as written in the Greek translation).

Finally, a supplementary volume covering the 1980s was published in 1989. It contains translated and original Greek articles which, sometimes, do not exist in the 34-volume set. The articles of the Greek version are being gradually digitised now; the digitised volumes can be found on &quot;vivlio2ebook&quot; blog, which is dedicated on digitising various books in Greek language. It is written on Modern (Demotic) Greek, but it uses the polytonic alphabet.

==Other Soviet encyclopedias==

==Content==
The &quot;Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; is a systematic summary of knowledge in social and economic studies with an emphasis on applied sciences. It became a universal reference work for the Soviet intelligentsia. According to the publisher&#x27;s foreword in the English-language translation of the encyclopedia, the encyclopedia is important for knowledge and understanding of the USSR. A major value of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; is its comprehensive information about the Soviet Union and its peoples. Every aspect of Soviet life is systematically presented, including history, economics, science, art, and culture. The ethnic diversity of USSR&#x27;s peoples and its languages and cultures are extensively covered. There are biographies of prominent cultural and scientific figures who are not as well known outside of Russia. There are detailed surveys of USSR&#x27;s provinces and towns, as well as their geology, geography, flora and fauna.

The encyclopedia&#x27;s Chief Editorial Board and advisory board sought input from the general public. The entry list was sent to universities, scientific institutions, museums, and private specialists in every field. More than 50,000 suggestions were received and many additions were made. Scholars believe that the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; is a valuable and useful source for Russian history. The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, though noted as having a strong Marxist bias, provides useful information for understanding the Soviet point of view.

===&quot;Damnatio memoriae&quot;===
Following the arrest and execution of Lavrentiy Beria, the head of the NKVD, in 1953 the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;—ostensibly in response to overwhelming public demand—mailed subscribers to the second edition a letter from the editor instructing them to cut out and destroy the three-page article on Beria and paste in its place enclosed replacement pages expanding the adjacent articles on F. W. Bergholz (an 18th-century courtier), the Bering Sea, and Bishop Berkeley. By April 1954, the Library of the University of California, Berkeley had received this “replacement.” This was not the only case of political influence. According to one author, &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; subscribers received missives to replace articles in the fashion of the Beria article frequently. Other articles, especially biographical articles on political leaders, changed significantly to reflect the current party line. An article affected in such a fashion was the one on Nikolai Bukharin, whose descriptions went through several evolutions.

==&quot;Great Russian Encyclopedia&quot;==

Publication of the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; was suspended in 1990 and halted in 1991, but in 2002 it was reinstituted by decree of Vladimir Putin. In 2003 and 2004 a team of editors overhauled the old encyclopedia by updating facts, removing most examples of overt political bias, and changing its name to the &quot;Great Russian Encyclopedia&quot;. Many outdated articles were entirely rewritten. In 2004 the first volume of the newly overhauled &quot;Great Russian Encyclopedia&quot; was published. The complete edition of 36 volumes was released by 2017.

Publication of the &quot;Great Russian Encyclopedia&quot; is overseen by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and funded by the Government of the Russian Federation. The encyclopedia is now found in libraries and schools throughout the CIS. Additionally, the 1980s editions remain in widespread use, particularly as references in scientific and mathematical research.

<text>Inner London is the group of London boroughs that form the interior part of Greater London and are surrounded by Outer London. With its origins in the bills of mortality, it became fixed as an area for statistics in 1847 and was used as an area of local government from 1855 to 1965 principally as the County of London or earlier as the Metropolitan Board of Works Area (metropolis). It now has two common definitions. The first is the statutory definition delineated in the London Government Act 1963, coming into force on 1 April 1965, comprising twelve Inner London boroughs and almost identical to the County of London that was abolished at the same time. The second is the definition used by the Office for National Statistics comprising eleven of the statutory Inner London boroughs and two of the statutory Outer London boroughs, as well as the City of London.

Inner London is smaller than Outer London both in terms of population and area, but the population density is more than double that of Outer London. Inner London is officially the wealthiest area in Europe with the most expensive street in Europe: as of 2013, the GDP per capita was more than €80,000 while the UK GDP per capita was around €27,000.

==History==
===Background===
The area that is now Inner London was defined by the Registrar General as a collection of parishes called &quot;London&quot; and appeared in the 1851 Census. At the time the metropolitan area—commonly called the Metropolis—had its origins in the area of the Bills of mortality that had expanded from the tiny City of London into three surrounding counties over the previous several hundred years. The area become fixed in 1847 with the addition of Lewisham Poor Law Union and the parish of Hampstead. In 1855 the Registrar General area, with the addition of Penge, was used to define the district of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Metropolis was also described as Inner London from the 1881 Census. In 1889 this area became the County of London. The area was adjusted in 1900 when Penge was transferred to Kent and South Hornsey was gained from Middlesex.

===London Government Act 1963===
The &quot;Inner London boroughs&quot; were defined by the London Government Act 1963. The Inner London boroughs occupied the same area as the County of London that was abolished as they were created. North Woolwich was an anomaly as it was part of the County of London, but became part of an Outer London borough.

The main difference between Inner and Outer London boroughs between 1965 and 1990 was that the councils of the inner boroughs were not local education authorities and there was a single Inner London Education Authority for the area, including the City of London. The inner borough councils became local education authorities on 1 April 1990.

The statutory definition is used as part of the grant settlement used to finance local government.

The statutory Inner London boroughs are:
* Camden
* Greenwich
* Hackney
* Hammersmith and Fulham
* Islington
* Kensington and Chelsea
* Lambeth
* Lewisham
* Southwark
* Tower Hamlets
* Wandsworth
* Westminster

Newham London Borough Council argues that the municipality should be treated as part of Inner London for statutory purposes, as it is for statistical purposes (see below). This would benefit the borough financially. Only the North Woolwich area of Newham fell within the former County of London, however, and the council&#x27;s advocacy has not borne fruit.

The City of London was not designated as an Inner London borough, but the Corporation of London is usually classed as an inner London local authority.

===Statistics===

The Office for National Statistics and Eurostat define Inner London differently, explicitly including the City of London, adding Haringey and Newham, but excluding Greenwich. The land area is and the population at the 2021 Census was 3,404,300.

==== Ethnicity ====

Figures before 1971 have been reconstructed by the Office for National Statistics based on past censuses in order to fit the 2001 limits. Figures from 1981 onward are ONS midyear estimates (revised as of 2010).

After centuries of increase, the population of Inner London reached its peak of 4,998,237 in 1911. The area&#x27;s population from World War I began a steady decline as that of Outer London continued to increase. The census of 1951 showed the damage inflicted by the 1940s Blitz as the population of Greater London switched into decline which was reversed in Outer London with house building and territory expansion whereas in Inner London continued. The war damage and early 20th century slums had physical and psychological hence property price effects and focus on New Towns and suburban development reflected a drive among urban planners for greener, less dense settlements. Inner London reached a post-War nadir, a population not seen since the early 19th century in 1981 having 2,550,100 residents, after which an upward trend ensued and Inner London residents numbered 3,231,901 in 2011 — 1,766,336 short of the 1911 peak.

==Strategic planning==
For the purposes of the London Plan planning document produced by the Mayor of London, Inner London consists of the City of London, all the statutory Inner London boroughs, and Newham.

==Other definitions==

The area covered by the London postal district is sometimes referred to as &quot;Inner London&quot;. However it is not coterminous with other definitions of Inner London as its area is somewhat larger and covers . The southern part of the London Borough of Lewisham as well as a small part of the Royal Borough of Greenwich fall outside its boundaries whilst 44 of its 119 districts are in Outer London and its irregular shape stretches to the Greater London boundary at Mill Hill and Scratch Wood and beyond it at Sewardstone.

From 1990 to 2000 London used two separate telephone dialling codes with one code designated for &quot;Inner London&quot;, however the area covered by this code was widely different from all of the above definitions and most of Greater London is now covered by a single &quot;020&quot; dialling code.

==Economy==
There are approximately 200,000 businesses with around 2,000,000 employees in Inner London. 56% of all private sector jobs in Greater London are located in Inner London. There is significant commuting of workers from Outer London and from outside Greater London. Much of the commercial activity is focused on Central London and Canary Wharf. 10% of public sector employment is focused on Westminster around the Government of the United Kingdom.

<doc id="379426" wikidata="Q144298" url="?curid=379426" title="Outer London">
<text>Outer London is the group of London boroughs that form a ring around Inner London. Together, the inner and outer boroughs form London, the capital city of the United Kingdom. The population at the 2021 Census was 5,395,500, which means over 60% of the population of Greater London lives in Outer London.

==History==
Outer London consists of areas that were not part of the County of London and became formally part of London when Greater London was created 1965. An exception is North Woolwich, which was in the County of London but was transferred to Newham in 1965.

==London Government Act 1963==
The twenty Outer London boroughs were defined by the London Government Act 1963. The main difference between Inner and Outer London boroughs between 1965 and 1990 was that the outer boroughs were local education authorities. The statutory Outer London boroughs are:

==ONS definition (statistics)==

The Office for National Statistics and the decennial UK Census use a different definition of Outer London, excluding Haringey and Newham (which are defined as Inner London), and including Greenwich. This is reflected in the (NUTS) classification. Under this classification, Outer London consists of the nineteen London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Bexley, Brent, Bromley, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Greenwich, Harrow, Havering, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Kingston upon Thames, Merton, Redbridge, Richmond upon Thames, Sutton, and Waltham Forest.

===Population===

Figures here are for the Office for National Statistics defined Outer London (in its 2001 limits), whose land area is . Figures before 1971 have been reconstructed by the Office for National Statistics based on past censuses in order to fit the 2001 limits.

Outer London continued to grow as population moved from Inner London, surpassing the Inner London population in 1951 at 4,517,588. The population of Greater London as a whole then started to decline, and the Outer London population fell from the 1951 peak to 4,230,000 in 1991. Since 1991 the Outer London population has been increasing again, surpassing the 1951 peak with a population of 4,942,040 in 2011. The population at the 2021 Census was 5,395,500. Over 60% of the population of Greater London lives in Outer London.

===Economy===
In 2002 there were 1.64 million jobs located in Outer London, which accounted for 42% of total jobs in London. Heathrow Airport and Croydon are the most significant locations for employment in Outer London.

=== Ethnicity ===
==Strategic planning==
For the purposes of the London Plan planning document produced by the Mayor of London, Outer London consists of the statutory Outer London boroughs, with the exception of Newham.

==Other definitions==
From 1990 to 2000 London used two telephone area codes with separate codes for &#x27;Inner London&#x27; and &#x27;Outer London&#x27; (originally 071 and 081 respectively, becoming 0171 and 0181 in 1995). The area covered by the &#x27;Outer London&#x27; code was widely different from all of the above definitions. 
In 2000, London returned to using a single 020 area code and all official distinctions between &#x27;inner&#x27; and &#x27;outer&#x27; London numbers ceased at this time.

<doc id="379439" wikidata="Q5550916" url="?curid=379439" title="Gerlach, Nevada">
<text>Gerlach, Nevada is a census-designated place (CDP) in Washoe County, Nevada, United States. The population was 130 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Reno–Sparks Metropolitan Statistical Area. Prior to 2010, Gerlach was part of the Gerlach–Empire census-designated place. The town of Empire is now a separate CDP. The next nearest town, Nixon, is to the south on a reservation owned by the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe. The Fly Geyser is located near Gerlach.

==History==

Gerlach was founded in 1906 during the construction of the Western Pacific Railroad Feather River Route.

Gerlach was named for the Gerlach Land and Cattle Company, owned by Louis Gerlach.

In 1997, the town and its homes and bars were used by the British team of the Thrust SSC supersonic car, as they pursued their goal of being the first to go faster than the speed of sound, which was achieved on October 15, 1997. The record still stands today. The Black Rock Saloon in the town kept track of the progress, given at the same time, Craig Breedlove attempted his own pursuit of the sound barrier. In 2017, several members of the former Thrust team revisited Gerlach for a reunion to mark the 20th anniversary.

In 2009, the Space Chair was lofted to near space north of Gerlach.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Gerlach CDP has a total area of , all land. Its elevation is . Gerlach is approximately north of Reno, Nevada.

==Demographics==

==Climate==
Gerlach has a steppe climate (Bsk).
==Economy==
The economy of Gerlach focuses on tourism in the nearby Black Rock Desert, and hunting. Gypsum mining was the historic staple of the local economy. Nearby Empire was a company town of the United States Gypsum Corporation (USG) until the plant closed on January 31, 2011, eliminating 95 jobs. In 2016, the town of Empire was purchased by the Empire Mining Company, who have re-opened gypsum mining operations, and have begun to rehabilitate the houses in town.

The other major industries are a Union Pacific switching station in Gerlach and public services of Washoe County, which includes its roads department and a K–12 public school owned by the Washoe County School District; the future of the Gerlach K–12 School is uncertain, as it is estimated after the gypsum plant closed in 2011, only around a dozen children remained in Gerlach. Many of the inhabitants of Gerlach are elderly retirees. Many people in Gerlach also have small private businesses. Many businesses are Internet-based, due to the town&#x27;s remote Nevada location. Hunters from all over the west travel to Gerlach to hunt a wide variety of game such as chukar, geese, deer, antelope, etc.

Since 1990, Burning Man, a week-long countercultural festival attended by 68,000 (), has been held nearby. The event is responsible for around 25% of the yearly sales at the few commercial establishments in the area, which include the closest permanent fuel and grocery stops to the Burning Man event site. As of 2023, the Burning Man Project owned about half the commercial property in Gerlach. The Black Rock Desert is also the site of many other recreational activities throughout the year.

==Government==
Gerlach previously had a volunteer fire department, but in 2015 the entire department resigned. The county had plans to establish fire services.

==Transportation==
Primary highway access to Gerlach is provided by State Route 447. It can also be accessed via three former state highways: State Route 34, State Route 48, and State Route 49 (also known as Jungo Road).

Gerlach has an airfield, simply a graded dirt strip, which is no longer usable. It should not be used unless under emergency.

The &quot;California Zephyr&quot; inter-city rail service was routed through Gerlach from its inception in 1949 until the end of its pre-Amtrak incarnation in 1970, providing direct service from Oakland, California to Chicago.
==In popular culture==
Gerlach was one of the film locations for the film &quot;Far From Home&quot; (1989). Gerlach was also the site for Gary Cooper&#x27;s first (credited) film, &quot;The Winning of Barbara Worth&quot; (1926).

==Media==
Gerlach has two non-profit community-based radio stations. KFBR 91.5 was run by Friends of Black Rock/High Rock. In 2022, KFBR was sold to the Burning Man Project for $6000. KLAP 89.5 is run by Open Sky Radio Corp and broadcast from a studio located at 395 Main Street in the old Gerlach Gas Station and Garage Building Office.

==Education==
Washoe County School District operates Gerlach K-12 School.

Ernest M. Johnson School, initially an elementary school in Empire, moved to the Gerlach High School site in Gerlach in 2001. By 2000 the school&#x27;s address was already in Gerlach. Johnson became a K-12 school in 2011.

Gerlach High, a grade 6-12 school, opened in 1931, and got a new building in 1955 as the original building was destroyed by a fire. The fire occurred in January 1955.

Gerlach has a public library, a branch of the Washoe County Library System, on the school property.

<doc id="379441" wikidata="Q5373997" url="?curid=379441" title="Empire, Nevada">
<text>Empire is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Washoe County, Nevada, with a population estimated at 65 (2021). Prior to the 2010 census it was part of the Gerlach–Empire census-designated place, it is now part of the Reno–Sparks Metropolitan Statistical Area. The nearest town, Nixon, is to the south on a reservation owned by the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe.

For 63 years, from 1948 to 2011, Empire was a company town of the US Gypsum Corporation, a manufacturer of gypsum based construction sheetrock, and once had a population of more than 750 people. US Gypsum closed the mine and the town in 2011; the mine and town were bought in 2016 by the Empire Mining Company (EMC), a manufacturer of gypsum based agricultural and construction additives. In 2016, the town again became a company town under the new auspices of EMC. Since that date both the town and the mine have been partially reopened by the new owners.

==History==
In 1907, Alex Ranson discovered gypsum near what later became Empire. In late 1909, Alex Ranson, Nick Curnow, E. H. Cowles and James Raser filed a patent for a selenite placer mining claim. In 1911, the mine was sold to unnamed buyers, rumored to be the plaster or gypsum trust from the eastern U.S. The sale was for between and . In 1922, the Pacific Portland Cement company started construction of a mill at what is now known as Empire. In 1924, the Pacific Portland Cement company completed the move of their mill to the current location of Empire from a location near Mound House, Nevada near what was then known as Empire and the Carson River mills. The company called the new plant Empire. U.S. Gypsum bought the town in 1948. Empire reached a maximum population of 750 in the early 1960s.

Amid a slump in the construction industry, the gypsum plant in Empire closed its doors on January 31, 2011, eliminating 95 jobs. Residents with children were allowed to continue inhabiting their company homes through June 20, 2011, the end of the school year. After that date, Empire had empty homes and a large shuttered plant that made it seem almost like a ghost town. The ZIP Code, 89405, was also discontinued. During the years that the mill and town were both closed (2011–2016), U.S. Gypsum first erected a large fence around the entire town and plant complex; it then retained two employees to patrol and maintain the property. It also brought two llamas onto the property to keep the grass trimmed.

In mid-2016, U.S. Gypsum sold the town and the mine to the Empire Mining Company, thus workers began to move back into the town to work under the new mine owners. Since 2016, both the mine and the town have been partially reopened by the new owners of the mine, with a total population of 65 (2021).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Empire CDP has a total area of , all land. Its elevation is above sea level.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Gypsum mining is the staple of Empire&#x27;s economy. After the recent reopening of the town, Empire has returned to being a classic company town, though smaller than before. Once again, all residents of Empire are associated with the mining operations of the town. Until its temporary closure in 2011, the Empire gypsum mine was one of the longest continually operating mines in the U.S., operating for 88 years from 1923 to 2011. While many mines were shut down during World War II as resources were diverted to the war effort, gypsum was determined to be an &quot;essential&quot; resource and the mine was never closed during that period.

During its heyday under U.S. Gypsum, the town had a church, a public pool, a nine-hole golf course, an airport, and a post office. There was also a day-care facility for the employees of Empire, and a convenience store with a gas station, the only store for more than . When EMC partially reopened the town in 2016, the store and gas station were transferred to new management. The Catholic Church of Empire also holds services on a monthly basis.

The economy of Empire includes serving tourists heading to the nearby Black Rock Desert and hunting. Since 1991, Burning Man, a week-long experimental festival with 78,850 participants (), has been held nearby. The event is responsible for around 20% of the sales at the few commercial establishments in the area, which include the closest permanent fuel and grocery stops to the event site. The Black Rock Desert is also the site of many other recreational activities throughout the year. After the closure of the plant in 2011, the grocery store remained the only source of provisions within of the Black Rock Desert.

==Transportation==
Primary highway access to Empire is provided by State Route 447.

Empire Airport is a dirt airfield suitable only for light planes.

==Education==
Washoe County School District is the area school district. Gerlach K-12 School is the local school. It includes a branch of the Washoe County Library System.

Ernest M. Johnson Elementary School in Empire opened in 1958. Circa 2000, it had 62 students. By 2000, the school&#x27;s address was already in Gerlach. The school moved to an addition at the Gerlach High School site in Gerlach in 2001. In 2011, Gerlach High was converted into the Johnson Elementary School for K-12.

==In popular culture==
The award-winning 2020 film &quot;Nomadland&quot;, based loosely on a true story, was partly filmed in Empire, and carefully documents some of the difficulties and adventures faced by a former Empire resident, Fern, after the closure of the town&#x27;s gypsum plant. The main character is played by Frances McDormand. Fern was also a former employee at the town&#x27;s Gypsum mill. Due to the plant closure, Fern, now age 62, is forced to leave town, and she starts a nomadic lifestyle, living out of her van, and taking on odd jobs along the way. The film is set in 2011 and 2012, and its script intentionally omits any reference to the 2016 partial re-opening of the town, ending the film&#x27;s story line apparently sometime before the 2016 re-opening.

<doc id="379448" wikidata="Q431117" url="?curid=379448" title="Ian Brown">
<text>Ian George Brown (born 20 February 1963) is an English musician. He was the lead singer and the only continuous member of the alternative rock band the Stone Roses from their formation in 1983. Following the band&#x27;s initial split in 1996, he began a solo career, releasing seven studio albums, a greatest hits compilation, a remix album, an 11-disc box set titled &quot;Collection&quot;, and 19 singles. He returned to singing for the Stone Roses in 2011, although this did not spell the end of his solo endeavours, releasing &quot;First World Problems&quot; through Virgin/EMI Records on 25 October 2018.

== Early life and education ==
Brown was born in Warrington on 20 February 1963 and grew up on Forster Street, Orford, until the age of about six. His father, George, was a joiner, and his mother, Jean, worked as a receptionist in a paper factory. He then moved with his family, including a brother (David) and sister (Sharon) to Sylvan Avenue in Timperley, Altrincham.

He attended Park Road County Primary Infant and Junior School and then Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, leaving aged 16. In 2015 and 2017, he testified against a former teacher at Altrincham Grammar, Fred Talbot, who was found guilty of sexually abusing pupils in the 1970s.

Brown&#x27;s interest in music was inspired by the punk movement, specifically the bands Sex Pistols, the Clash, and Manchester-based Slaughter &amp; the Dogs. He was also an early follower of psychobilly music and was a regular at many scooter rallies in the north of England. Brown and original Stone Roses bassist Pete Garner attended the recording of the Clash single &quot;Bankrobber&quot; in Manchester.

== Music career ==

===The Stone Roses===
Brown&#x27;s music career began in 1980, playing bass guitar in a band with John Squire and Simon Wolstencroft. They eventually became the Patrol, with Andy Couzens on vocals. The band soon split up, with Brown selling his bass to buy a scooter. Brown moved to Hulme and attended Northern soul &quot;all-nighters&quot; across Northern England in the early 1980s as the scene faded. Around this time, Brown met soul legend Geno Washington, who told him, &quot;You should be a star.&quot;
In 1983, Brown joined the Waterfront, the band that would evolve into the Stone Roses, as co-vocalist.

The Stone Roses rose to prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their debut album voted the best British album of all time in 2004. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Second Coming&quot;, received a mixed reaction, and after several changes of line-up, the band split up in October 1996.

On 17 October 2011, Brown alluded to a Stone Roses reunion via text message, saying, &quot;We are going to rule the world again. It&#x27;s happening.&quot; On the following day, a reunion was announced for the band with performances planned for June 2012 in Manchester. In a press conference interview, the members of the Stone Roses have said that a new album is planned.

On 2 December 2011, Ian Brown and John Squire performed together live for the first time since 1995. They joined Mick Jones from The Clash, The Farm, and Pete Wylie at the Manchester Ritz in a concert in aid of the Justice for Hillsborough campaign. They performed &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot; as a duo before being joined by Mick Jones and The Farm for renditions of the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Bankrobber&quot; and &quot;Armagideon Time&quot;, with Ian Brown taking on lead vocals for the three songs.

The Stone Roses reunited in 2011 and went on a reunion tour in 2012. They continued to tour until 2017 when the band disbanded for a second time.

===Solo career===
After a break from music in Morocco, Brown established his solo career with the debut solo single &quot;My Star&quot;, which was released in the UK on 12 January 1998. The debut album &quot;Unfinished Monkey Business&quot; followed on 2 February 1998. The album was produced and financed by Brown and featured ex-Roses members Mani, Nigel Ipinson, Aziz Ibrahim, and Robbie Maddix. The album sold over 300,000 copies.

Brown toured in summer 1998 with a band that included Aziz Ibrahim (guitar), Inder &quot;Goldfinger&quot; Matharu (tabla/percussion), Simon Moore (drums), and Sylvan Richardson (bass), including performances at the Glastonbury Festival and the V Festival. Brown was arrested after a flight back from his live show in Paris and later sentenced to four months in prison for using threatening behaviour towards a flight attendant and captain, a charge he denied, causing his tour to be rescheduled. His bandmate Aziz Ibrahim condemned the sentence, saying that Brown was &quot;just being cheeky&quot;. He had threatened to cut off the hands of the flight attendant and hammered on the cockpit door, as the plane came in to land. A few weeks before, he had threatened a magazine critic, who had given his album a one-star review, to a &quot;good kicking&quot;.

While in Strangeways Prison, Brown wrote the lyrics for &quot;Free My Way&quot;, &quot;So Many Soldiers&quot;, and &quot;Set My Baby Free&quot;. He was released on parole after two months.

His second album, &quot;Golden Greats&quot;, was released by Polydor Records in 1999. It featured more electronic instrumentation and earned critical acclaim. For his third studio album, &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;, Brown sought outside production help for the first time, hiring the services of songwriter and producer Dave McCracken, who would go on to become a regular collaborator. He toured the US for the first time as a solo artist in support of the album.

Brown&#x27;s fourth solo album, &quot;Solarized&quot;, was released in the UK on 13 September 2004 and was the first to be released under the revived Polydor imprint Fiction Records. When his new Fiction A&amp;R Jim Chancellor was asked in HitQuarters what contribution he makes to Brown&#x27;s records, he said, &quot;There&#x27;s not as much to do. Ian is very much the master of his own records.&quot;

Since the break-up of the Stone Roses in 1996, Brown has released six solo albums and fourteen UK Top 40 singles. He has sold out seven UK tours and appeared three times at the Glastonbury Festival, including headlining the Other Stage in 2005. He has appeared five times at V Festival since 1998, along with regular appearances at T in the Park and Oxegen festivals, and played the Move festival in 2002 at Old Trafford Cricket Ground as well as two tours of Australia in 2006 and 2008.

At the 2006 &quot;NME&quot; awards, Brown was presented with the &quot;Godlike Genius&quot; award and in 2007, was given the &quot;Q&quot; &quot;Legend&quot; Award.

In September 2007, Brown released his fifth studio album, &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;. The album represented a more political approach in his music, particularly the anti-war track &quot;Illegal Attacks&quot;, which featured Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. The album also featured former Smiths bassist Andy Rourke, Paul Ryder of Happy Mondays, and Steve Jones and Paul Cook of The Sex Pistols.

&quot;My Way&quot;, his sixth solo album, was released in September 2009. It was recorded at London&#x27;s Battery Studios with producer Dave McCracken; the first single, &quot;Stellify&quot;, was released 21 September 2009. Brown played Manchester Arena for the third time in December 2009 and in 2010, made his third appearance in Moscow and second in Beijing, China. Since turning solo in 1998, Brown has played shows in 45 countries.

Brown has collaborated several times with UNKLE, appearing on &quot;Be There&quot; in 1999 and on &quot;Reign&quot; on the 2003 album &quot;Never, Never, Land&quot;, which was also released as a single.

On 25 October 2018, he released his first solo material in nine years with the single &quot;First World Problems&quot;. His seventh studio album, &quot;Ripples&quot;, was then released on 1 February 2019.

On 18 September 2020, Brown announced the release of new song &quot;Little Seed, Big Tree&quot; through his Twitter account. The song appears to refer to the COVID-19 pandemic, and express anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine sentiment. Brown later complained that it was taken off Spotify. A Spotify spokesman stated that the platform &quot;prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, deceptive, or misleading content about COVID-19&quot;.

In September 2022 he made the first appearance of a UK tour, with a sold-out performance in Leeds. His use of backing tracks in place of a live band was met with a negative reaction by some attendees.

== Film and television ==
Brown had a cameo role in the 2004 film &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; as a wizard magically stirring his drink while reading Stephen Hawking&#x27;s &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; at the Leaky Cauldron.
In 2010, he had a cameo role as a police officer in Shane Meadows&#x27; series &quot;This is England &#x27;86&quot;, a sequel to the film &quot;This is England&quot;.

==Personal life==
Brown is a teetotaler, claiming that he has not had a drink of alcohol since 1999.

Brown was married to Fabiola Quiroz, a model from Mexico. They divorced in 2011. He has three children, one with Quiroz, the other two from a previous relationship.

Brown is a lifelong supporter of Manchester United F.C. and is a season ticket holder. For the 2005–06 season, Brown was the shirt sponsor of London Commercial Division football team Chiswick Homefields, the players wearing an &quot;IB – The Greatest&quot; logo on their chests.

=== Legal issues ===
In October 1998, Brown was arrested and sentenced to four months in jail for threatening a British Airways attendant on a flight to Manchester from Paris. He spent two months in jail. In June 2005, Brown was arrested in San Francisco after an altercation with a fan who tackled Brown on stage. However, no charges were pressed against Brown. In 2011, Brown was given a driving ban following three speeding violations. He was fined over £1,900.

===Views===
Brown believes in God, but does not subscribe to any organized religion.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, Brown promoted conspiracy theories that contributed to COVID-19 misinformation, and criticised lockdowns, the use of masks and the COVID-19 vaccine. In July 2021, Brown received a two-week Twitter ban for posting that the vaccine was not effective. He pulled out of a festival headline slot as he disagreed with its vaccine passport for entry policy, calling it the &quot;new nazi normal&quot;.

Brown&#x27;s anti-COVID lockdown song &quot;Little Seed, Big Tree&quot;, which featured lyrics alluding to conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 vaccine, was taken down from Spotify. The song was re-listed on Spotify, and was available as of October 2024.

<text>Odd Job Jack is a Canadian adult animated sitcom starring Don McKellar playing the main character of the series named Jack Ryder and his misadventures in temporary employment. Seen on and produced for The Comedy Network, a cable specialty channel, and once available on iTunes, Adult Swim and MuchMusic in Latin America, 2x2 in Russia, Hulu in the United States, and MusiquePlus in French-speaking Canada. A total of 52 episodes were produced over four seasons. Reruns also aired in winter 2013 on MTV2.

==Production==
Odd Job Jack was created by Smiley Guy Studios in Toronto. The show was originally developed as a web-based cartoon and based on an early short the creators made called &quot;The Seen&quot;, which released in 1997, but quickly moved to cable television distribution. The producers of the show pay homage to their web roots by maintaining a web site that contains unique interactive content to support each episode, largely consisting of Flash games. They advertised this connection as being a &quot;sit.com&quot;. An advertising deal with Molson Canadian helped fund the move to television.

On July 14, 2006 in an email to subscribers, Smiley Guy Studios announced FreeJack, an initiative under which they have started releasing the master files of every character, prop, and background from every episode for the upcoming season under a non-commercial share-friendly license. However, in 2007, after the fourth season the show definitely ended production.

Every episode is structured by the opening theme, the full episode and the closing credits. The series featured an experimental form of described video, wherein rather than a neutral narrator, the actors would describe visual sequences in-character.

==Plot==
The eponymous character, Jack Ryder, graduates from university with a degree in sociology and becomes a temporary employee at an agency called Odd Jobs which specializes in filling difficult and unusual positions. Each episode ends with Jack adding a chapter to a book which he is writing about his experiences on his laptop.

When not working, Jack often hangs with his eccentric friends, Leopold &quot;Leo&quot; Trench, an agoraphobic computer hacker who, like one of the characters in McKellar&#x27;s earlier comedy series,&quot; Twitch City&quot;, is unable to leave his apartment but nonetheless leads a complex and bizarre life, and Bobby Lee, an Asian kid who works in the family store by day, and is a club disc-jockey and masked hero by night.

Jack also spends some time at the beginning and end of each episode at the agency where he attempts to develop a rapport with Betty Styles, the female assignment &quot;associate&quot; while under electronic surveillance from the gruff, imperious, and decidedly unpleasant, manager/owner (Mr. Fister) who is often involved in some way in the bizarre conspiracies, sordid sexual escapades, and crimes which lurk behind the workaday appearances of Jack&#x27;s assignments.

At the conclusion of season three, Betty, after stealing the company jet to rescue Jack from African kidnappers, is fired from Odd Jobs and runs away to a distant country. Jack is greeted in each season four episode with a new assignment associate, each with a personality defect. The first season also featured Jacques, a French Canadian doppelgänger to Jack who serves as an office nemesis.

==Cast==
*Don McKellar as Jack Ryder, a 25 year old sociologist who works at Odd Jobs. In each episode, he has a new job, while trying to flirt with his career counsellor, Betty Styles, often being met with rejection. He can be seen in every episode writing a journal about his experiences as a temp.
*Teress Morton as Betty Styles, Jack’s career counsellor in seasons 1-3. After being fired from Odd Jobs and running away at the end of the season 3 finale, she is replaced by a variety of new career counsellors in season 4.
*Matthew Ferguson as Bobby Lee, a naive boy and one of Jack’s friends who works at Big Fat Store, a convenience store owned by his family. In season 1, he has a crime-fighting alter ego known as DJ Sherpa.
*Enoch Savage (episodes 1-6), Jeremy Diamond (episode 7-onward) as Leopold Trench, an agoraphobic computer hacker and one of Jack’s friends, he is often seen in his home (known as The Trench).
*Rick Miller as Mr. Fister, Jack and Betty’s boss and the manager of Odd Jobs, who oversees them from his office to intervene in their meetings about each episode’s job. He is never shown from the front. He does not appear in season 3, but made one final appearance in season 4.
*Jeff Lumby as Jacques, a French-Canadian rival for Jack at Odd Jobs. For unknown reasons, he stopped appearing after season 1.
*Mairon Bennett as Spoons Ryder, Jack’s sister. She is an activist who will jump at every opportunity to chew out her own brother.
*Julia Donovan as Barbara &quot;Babs&quot; Ryder, Jack’s mother. She works as an executive at an advertising company. Her husband, Ron Ryder, left her behind when Jack was young, leaving her to raise both Jack and Spoons on her own.
*Maria Vacratsis as Maxine &quot;Max&quot; Ryder, Jack’s grandmother. Old and retired, she often spends her spare time sitting on the couch, smoking marijuana.

===Guests===
The show features voice work by a number of often Canadian celebrities, especially after the first season: celebrities appear occasionally on the second season, and the third season has a special celebrity guest star for each episode, who either play themselves or voice one of the show&#x27;s eccentric, if not mad, characters. Celebrities in the first season were Dave Foley, Troy Hurtubise, Gary Farmer, the Barenaked Ladies, Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, John O&#x27;Hurley, Megan Follows, Christopher Plummer, Rick Mercer, Kenny Hotz, Catherine O&#x27;Hara and Don Knotts. The second season sees Tom Arnold, Scott Thompson, James Woods, Tom Green, Leslie Nielsen, Will Arnett, Samantha Bee, and John Goodman accompany Jack on his adventures in the weird world of work.

== Reception ==
&quot;Odd Job Jack&quot; was nominated for the Gemini Awards in 2006 for best &quot;Best Cross Platform Project&quot; and the Canadian Comedy Awards in 2007 in the &quot;Writing Series&quot; category, while winning the CFTPA Indie Awards in 2008 for &quot;Best Convergent New Media&quot;,and the Banff World Television Award for &quot;Interactive Program Enhancements&quot;. The series achieved over three million views within its first year on Hulu. Writing for TheGATE.ca critic W. Andrew Powell wrote that &quot;“Odd Job Jack” is also pretty damn funny. It’s charm is that it’s extremely funny, without half of the insanity or depravity of shows like “South Park“. Sure, people get chopped up &amp; eaten, dead people get up and dance, and famous people get made fun of, but it’s surprisingly fresh without being utterly offensive.&quot; Andrew Ryan for The Globe and Mail noted of the season three premiere that &quot;Odd Job Jack is still sharply written and crudely animated, which is part of its appeal. Be grateful some things remain resistant to change.&quot;

<doc id="379458" wikidata="Q1130380" url="?curid=379458" title="Urim and Thummim">
<text>In the Hebrew Bible, the Urim ( &quot;ʾŪrīm&quot;, &quot;lights&quot;) and the Thummim ( &quot;Tummīm&quot;, &quot;perfection&quot; or &quot;truth&quot;) are elements of the &quot;hoshen&quot;, the breastplate worn by the High Priest attached to the ephod, a type of apron or garment. The pair are used frequently in the Old Testament, in Exodus 28:30 through God&#x27;s instruction to Aaron on how to adorn his breastplate worn in the holy place; in 1 Samuel 14:41 by King Saul to determine who was at fault for breaking the army&#x27;s fast; and Ezra 2 to determine whether those who claimed to be the descendants of the priests of Israel were truly of that class. The Urim and Thummim are sometimes connected by scholars with cleromancy (with divination by casting lots), although it is equally likely no casting was physically done, and the participants of Lights and Perfection waited for a sign to answer a question or reveal the will of God.

==Name and meaning==

&quot;Urim&quot; () traditionally has been taken to derive from a root meaning &quot;lights&quot;; these derivations are reflected in the Neqqudot of the Masoretic Text. In consequence, &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; has traditionally been translated as &quot;lights and perfections&quot; (by Theodotion, for example), or, by taking the phrase allegorically, as meaning &quot;revelation and truth&quot; or &quot;doctrine and truth.&quot; It appears in this form in the Vulgate, in the writing of St. Jerome, and in the Hexapla. The latter use was defended in modern Catholic interpretations by connecting &quot;Urim&quot; and &quot;Thummim&quot; to the roots ירה &quot;to teach&quot; and אׇמַן &quot;be true&quot;.

&quot;Thummim&quot; () is widely considered to be derived from the consonantal root (&quot;t-m-m&quot;) &quot;innocent&quot;. Many scholars now believe that &quot;Urim&quot; () simply derives from the Hebrew (&quot;Arrim&quot;) &quot;curses&quot; and thus that &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; essentially means &quot;cursed or faultless&quot;, in reference to the deity&#x27;s judgment of an accused person; in other words, &quot;Urim&quot; and &quot;Thummim&quot; were used to answer the question &quot;innocent or guilty&quot;.

Assyriologist William Muss-Arnolt connected the singular forms—&quot;ur&quot; and &quot;tumm&quot;—with the Babylonian terms &quot;ūrtu&quot; and &quot;tamītu&quot;, meaning &quot;oracle&quot; and &quot;command&quot;, respectively. According to his theory, the Hebrew words use a &quot;pluralis intensivus&quot; to enhance their apparent majesty, not to indicate the presence of more than one. Along these lines, the &quot;Urim&quot; and &quot;Thummim&quot; are hypothesized to derive from the Tablet of Destinies worn by Marduk on his breast according to Babylonian religion.

==Form and function==

 is regarded by biblical scholars as key to understanding the Urim and Thummim; the passage describes an attempt to identify a sinner by repeatedly splitting the people into two groups and identifying which group contains the sinner. In the version of this passage in the Masoretic Text, it describes Saul and Jonathan being separated from the rest of the people, and lots being cast between them; the Septuagint version, however, states that &quot;Urim&quot; would indicate Saul and Jonathan, while &quot;Thummim&quot; would indicate the people. In the Septuagint, a previous verse uses a phrase which is usually translated as &quot;inquired of God&quot;, which is significant as the grammatical form of the Hebrew implies that the inquiry was performed by objects being manipulated; scholars view it as evident from these verses and versions that cleromancy was involved, and that &quot;Urim&quot; and &quot;Thummim&quot; were the names of the objects being cast.

The description of the clothing of the Hebrew high priest in the Book of Exodus portrays the Urim and Thummim as being put into the sacred breastplate, worn by the high priest over the Ephod. Where the biblical text elsewhere describes an Ephod being used, scholars presume that it is referring to use of the Urim and Thummim in conjunction with the Ephod, as this seems to be intimately connected with it; similarly where non-prophets are portrayed as asking God for guidance, and the advice is not described as given by visions, scholars think that Urim and Thummim were the medium implied. In all but two cases ( and ), the question is one which is effectively answered by a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;; a number of scholars believe that the two exceptions to this pattern, which give more complex answers, were originally also just sequences of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions, but became corrupted by later editing.

There is no description of the form of the Urim and Thummim in the passage describing the high priest&#x27;s vestments, and a number of scholars believe that the author of the passage, which textual scholars attribute to the priestly source, was not actually entirely aware of what they were either. Nevertheless, the passage does describe them as being &quot;put into&quot; the breastplate, which scholars think implies they were objects put into some sort of pouch within it, and then, while out of view, one (or one side, if the &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; was a single object) was chosen by touch and withdrawn or thrown out; since the Urim and Thummim were put inside this pouch, they were presumably small and fairly flat, and were possibly tablets of wood or of bone. Considering the scholars&#x27; conclusion that &quot;Urim&quot; essentially means &quot;guilty&quot; and &quot;Thummim&quot; essentially means &quot;innocent&quot;, this would imply that the purpose of the Urim and Thummim was an ordeal to confirm or refute suspected guilt; if the Urim was selected it meant guilt, while selection of the Thummim would mean innocence.

According to classical rabbinical literature, in order for the Urim and Thummim to give an answer, it was first necessary for the individual to stand facing the fully dressed high priest, and vocalise the question briefly and in a simple way, though it was not necessary for it to be loud enough for anyone else to hear it. Maimonides explains that the High Priest would stand facing the Ark of the Covenant with the inquirer behind him, facing the Priest&#x27;s back. After the inquirer asked his question, the Holy Spirit would immediately overcome the Priest and he would see the letters protruding in a prophetic vision. The Talmudic rabbis argued that &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; were words written on the sacred breastplate. Most of the Talmudic rabbis, and Josephus, following the belief that &quot;Urim&quot; meant &quot;lights&quot;, argued that the rituals involving Urim and Thummim involved questions being answered by great rays of light shining out of certain jewels on the breastplate; each jewel was taken to represent different letters, and the sequence of lighting thus would spell out an answer (though there were 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet, and only 12 jewels on the breastplate); two Talmudic rabbis, however, argued that the jewels themselves moved in a way that made them stand out from the rest, or even moved themselves into groups to form words.

==History of use==
The first reference to &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; in the Bible is the description in the Book of Exodus concerning the high priest&#x27;s vestments; the chronologically earliest passage mentioning them, according to textual scholars, is in the Book of Hosea, where it is implied, by reference to the Ephod, that the Urim and Thummim were fundamental elements in the popular form of the Israelite religion, in the mid 8th century BC. Consulting the Urim and Thummim was said to be permitted for determining territorial boundaries, and was said to be required, in addition to permission from the king or a prophet, if there was an intention to expand Jerusalem or the Temple in Jerusalem; however, these rabbinical sources questioned, or at least tried to justify, why Urim and Thummim would be required when a prophet was also present. The classical rabbinical writers argued that the Urim and Thummim were only permitted to be consulted by very prominent figures such as army generals, the most senior of court figures, and kings, and the only questions which could be raised were those which were asked for the benefit of the people as a whole. To uncover the sin of Achan the sacred Lots were used by Joshua. Abiathar joined David, who was then in the cave of Adullam (1 Sam. 22:20–23, 23:6). He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader (1 Sam. 30:7). When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed High Priest (1 Chr. 15:11; 1 Kings 2:26) and the &quot;king&#x27;s counselor&quot; (1 Chr. 27:33–34). Meanwhile, Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made High Priest. According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; Abiathar was deposed from office when he was deserted by the Holy Spirit without which the Urim and Thummin could not be consulted.

Although Josephus argues that the Urim and Thummim continued to function until the era of the Maccabees, Talmudic sources are unanimous in agreeing that the Urim and Thummim stopped functioning much earlier, when Jerusalem was sacked by the Babylonians. In a passage from the part of the Book of Ezra which overlaps with the Book of Nehemiah, it is mentioned that individuals who were unable to prove, after the Babylonian captivity had ended, that they were descended from the priesthood before the captivity began, were required to wait until priests in possession of Urim and Thummim were discovered; this would appear to confirm the statements in the Talmud that the Urim and Thummim had by then been lost. Indeed, since the priestly source, which textual scholars date to a couple of centuries prior to the captivity, does not appear to know what the Urim and Thummim looked like, and there is no mention of the Urim and Thummim in the deuteronomic history beyond the death of David, scholars suspect that use of them decayed some time before the Babylonian conquest, probably as a result of the growing influence of prophets at that time.

Maimonides states that in the Second Temple the Urim and Thummim actually existed but no longer functioned in the practical sense since the priests no longer possessed the Holy Spirit. Rabbi Abraham ben David disagrees and maintains that during that era, the Urim and Thummim were completely absent.

==Latter Day Saint movement==
Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, said that he used interpreters in order to translate the Book of Mormon from the golden plates. In early accounts, Smith described the interpreters as &quot;spectacles&quot;, described as two transparent stones set in silver bows. The earliest association of the spectacles with the biblical term &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; occurred in 1833 and Smith appears to have adopted the term in subsequent descriptions. The Urim and Thummim were said to have been found with the golden plates, a breastplate (to which the silver bows were attached in some descriptions), and the Sword of Laban. Smith&#x27;s mother, Lucy Mack Smith, described these Urim and Thummim as being like &quot;two smooth three-cornered diamonds.&quot; Smith and others also referred to individual seer stones also associated with Smith&#x27;s dictation of the Book of Mormon as Urim and Thummim, although his wife, Emma Smith, in her later accounts distinguished between the seer stones and the Urim and Thummim.

Smith also said he used the Urim and Thummim to assist him in receiving other divine revelations, including some of the sections of the Doctrine and Covenants and portions of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible. Only Oliver Cowdery is claimed to have attempted to use them to receive his own revelation. Many Latter Day Saints believe that Smith&#x27;s Urim and Thummim were functionally identical to the biblical Urim and Thummim.

Smith extended the use of the term &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; to describe the dwelling place of God, the earth in a future state, and the white stone mentioned in the Book of Revelation.

==In popular culture==
In accordance with the belief that &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; translates to &quot;Light and Truth&quot;, the Latin equivalent &quot;Lux et Veritas&quot; has been used for several university mottoes. For example, &quot;Lux et Veritas&quot; is the motto of Indiana University and the University of Montana. Similarly, Northeastern University&#x27;s motto is &quot;Lux, Veritas, Virtus&quot; (&quot;Light, Truth, Virtue&quot;). &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; itself is emblazoned in Hebrew across the open book pictured on the Yale University coat of arms, and the translation &quot;Lux et Veritas&quot; appears below on a banner.

The Urim and Thummim are also mentioned in some modern fiction:
* Urim and Thummim were the names given to two objects of mystical technology in the Prosopopeia transmedia series, culminating in the International Emmy Award-winning participatory drama series &quot;The Truth About Marika&quot; by SVT and The company P.
* In the television series &quot;Dig&quot;, the breastplate that is a part of the mystery is said to be the breastplate of the High Priest of the Temple in Jerusalem and used to communicate with God.
* In Paulo Coelho&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, Urim and Thummim are black and white fortune-telling stones that Melchizedek gives to Santiago, with their colors representing “yes” and “no” answers to questions.
*In John Bellairs’ young adult novel &quot;The Revenge of the Wizard’s Ghost&quot;, the two main characters go in search of the Urim and Thummim, imagined as stones with healing powers.
* In &quot;The Object – The Urim and Thummim&quot; (2007), a documentary directed by Jacob Young, &quot;The story of a musician&#x27;s fascinating discovery of an ancient relic, as he attempts to seek its mysterious significance and share the artifact with the world.&quot;

Most recently, she played the role of Nima in Hullraisers, Mari Hoff in the 2022 UK Tour of The Rise and Fall of Little Voice, and is reprising the role of Ray in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talking About&quot; &quot;Jamie&quot; for the 2023-2024 UK and Ireland Tour.

Gulati was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours for services to the cultural industries.

==Early life==

Gulati was born in Oldham, Lancashire, to Punjabi Hindu parents. She grew up in the Salcombe area of Openshaw, Manchester, where she became friends with actress Sarah Lancashire. She has a degree in Arabic and Middle Eastern politics from the University of Manchester.

==Career==
One of Gulati&#x27;s earliest appearances was as a dancer in the video for Boy George&#x27;s 1991 single &quot;Bow Down Mister&quot;. In the late 1990s, she appeared in both series of Victoria Wood&#x27;s BBC sitcom &quot;dinnerladies&quot;. She appeared as Ameena Badawi from October to December 2000 in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. She appeared in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as Sunita and in the same role in &quot;East Street&quot;, a crossover between both soaps, as part of the 2010 Children In Need telethon. In 2001, she appeared in the short film &quot;Shadowscan&quot;, directed by Tinge Krishnan, which won a Bafta Award and, in 2004, was nominated for a &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; theatre award for her work in the play &quot;Dancing Within Walls&quot;, which was staged at the Contact Theatre in Manchester.

In early 2006, Gulati took part in the Reality TV series &quot;Soapstar Superstar&quot;.

After Gulati left &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for the first time in 2006, she played Nisha Clayton, a regular role in the final series of &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;, and made appearances in &quot;New Street Law&quot; and the one-off comedy drama &quot;Magnolia&quot;, which was written by Dave Spikey for BBC&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; series.

In October 2006, Gulati appeared at the Royal Albert Hall as part of a short skit featured in &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;. In the sketch, Gulati and her co-star Nitin Ganatra play a holidaying couple who are under the mistaken belief Guantanamo Bay is a holiday resort. The sketch also starred the American actors Chevy Chase and Seth Green.

Gulati was one of the storytellers in a CBBC revival of &quot;Jackanory&quot; and in the UK tour of the hit play &quot;Girls Night&quot; by Louise Roche. She also appeared on the Channel 4 special &quot;Empire&#x27;s Children&quot;, tracing her family&#x27;s history during the partition of India. In summer 2007, she appeared in &quot;Pretend You Have Big Buildings&quot; at the Royal Exchange, Manchester.

In 2008, Gulati made her debut as a filmmaker, producing the short film &quot;Akshay&quot; for the motiroti&#x27;s 60x60 Secs. This was shortlisted for the Satyajit Ray short film awards. During this same period, she returned to her &quot;Coronation Street&quot; role as Sunita Alahan, where she stayed for three years.

On 11 June 2009, Gulati appeared in the BBC1 programme &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;. She did the first stage tour of &quot;dinnerladies&quot; in early 2009 and she has appeared as a guest story teller for &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; on CBBC. Gulati made her &quot;Loose Women&quot; debut on 18 November 2010 to celebrate 50 years of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, appearing with regulars Kate Thornton, Sherrie Hewson and Carol McGiffin. Gulati returned to the show on 11 April 2012 appearing alongside regulars Andrea McLean, Jane McDonald and Janet Street-Porter during soap week. Gulati returned to the show as a regular from 13 March 2013, taking over from Sally Lindsay who took time off to film &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;, from September 2013, Gulati became an occasional panellist on the show, before leaving on 30 May 2014.

In June 2011, Gulati was a guest on &quot;Countdown&quot;. Announcing her departure from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, she expressed her desire to write and perform more comedy than her work in a soap opera had permitted her time to do. In 2016, she appeared in the ITV/Netflix series &quot;Paranoid&quot;. Gulati made a guest appearance in &quot;Casualty&quot; on 29 October 2016.

In 2017, she appeared as Saba in the British romantic comedy film &quot;Finding Fatimah&quot;. 
In 2018, Gulati appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes &quot;Arachnids in the UK&quot; and &quot;Demons of the Punjab&quot; as Najia Khan, mother of The Doctor&#x27;s companion Yaz Khan.

Gulati played Ray in the West End production of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talking About Jamie&quot; at the Apollo Theatre in 2018. Now adapted as a screenplay, Gulati played the part of Ray alongside Sarah Lancashire. &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talking About Jamie&quot; was released on 17 September 2021. In 2022, she led the company of &quot;The Rise and Fall of Little Voice&quot; as Mari Hoff, and starred in the show alongside her son Akshay. Gulati is reprising the role of Ray in the 2023-2024 UK and Ireland Tour of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talking About Jamie&quot;.

Gulati wrote a memoir titled &quot;Remember Me?&quot; on losing a parent to dementia based on her experiences caring for her mother, who died in 2019. During publicity interviews for the book, Gulati revealed that she had contracted Coronavirus earlier in 2020.

In May 2021, Gulati starred as Vicky in the three-part comedy drama murder mystery series, &quot;Murder, They Hope&quot;.

In December 2022, Gulati appeared as Posy in the Christmas special of BBC dark comedy &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;, &quot;The Bones of St Nicholas&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gulati is the daughter of K. A. Gulati who arrived in Oldham from Bombay, India, in 1960. She has a younger brother, Rajesh, and two older sisters, Sushma and Hema.

Gulati married the architect Anshu Srivastava in a Hindu ceremony on 10 November 1990; the couple divorced in May 1994. Shobna lived separately from her husband and became pregnant. From 1999 to 2003, Shobna was in a relationship with the ex-&quot;Emmerdale&quot; actor Gary Turner.

Gulati has a working knowledge of six languages and is a vocal supporter of Asian women&#x27;s rights and various anti-racism campaigns. Shobna works on female body image issues. Shobna is a supporter and a season ticket holder of Manchester United.

In 2015, Shobna was appointed as a deputy lieutenant of Greater Manchester. This gives her the right to use the Post Nominal Letters &quot;DL&quot; for life.

===Shafilea Ahmed===
Gulati was asked to help a murder hunt in December 2004 following the murder of Shafilea Ahmed. At a press conference appealing for more information, Gulati read out some of the poems found in her bedroom during their investigations which &quot;were a testimony to her sadness at being caught in a culture clash with other members of her family&quot;. After the reading, Gulati said that she believed they showed that Shafilea was trapped between two cultures. &quot;It can be very difficult if you are born here but your parents were not and there can be a lot of cultural issues,&quot; she said. &quot;It is a situation facing many young Asian women who are unable to express themselves properly within their families. I feel these words are the sort of style she would use when talking with her friends. If she is out there she should let people know she is safe because there are organizations and individuals who can help her.&quot;

Gulati said that she sympathised with the teenager&#x27;s difficulty in balancing her culture with her upbringing. &quot;She has obviously been unable to express herself in terms of her family and she probably talks like this to her friends, or has written these songs in private.&quot;

<doc id="379470" wikidata="Q977650" url="?curid=379470" title="Youth Criminal Justice Act">
<text>The Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA; ) is a federal Canadian statute that covers the prosecution of youths for criminal offences.

Coming into effect on April 1, 2003, the Act replaced the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot;, which itself was a replacement for the &quot;Juvenile Delinquents Act&quot;.

==Definition of youth==
The &quot;Act&quot; governs the application of criminal and correctional law to those 12 years old or older, but younger than 18 at the time of committing the offence (Section 2 of the YCJA). Youth aged 14 to 17 may be sentenced as adults under certain conditions, as described later on in the &quot;Act&quot;. The &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, section 13, states &quot;No person shall be convicted of an offence in respect of an act or omission on their part while that person was under the age of twelve years.&quot;

==Preamble==
The preamble of the &quot;Act&quot; recognizes that youth have rights protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Bill of Rights and the United Nation&#x27;s Convention on the Rights of the Child.

==Declaration of principles==
The &quot;Act&quot; includes four general principles found in section 3(1).

===Basic principles and intentions===
Paragraph (a) addresses the basic principles of the &quot;Act&quot; and the &quot;Act&quot; intentions on dealing with young offenders and youth crime. More specifically, paragraph (a) sets the basic principle that the YCJA attempts to address underlying behaviour, such as pre-existing conditions or circumstances that would lead to an offending behaviour. It also seeks to, above all, reintegrate young persons who commit offences into society through means of rehabilitation.

===Accountability, rehabilitation, and reintegration===
Paragraph (b) incorporates a recognition that young people need to be held accountable for their crimes, and have a greater opportunity to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society. &quot;The criminal justice system for young persons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize the following:&quot;

:(i) &quot;Rehabilitation and Reintegration&quot;: The implementation of extrajudicial measures instead of more punitive sentences for less serious offences &quot;address the rehabilitative needs of youths within the limit of a proportionate response to the offence&quot;. The goal is to first rehabilitate and then reintegrate (assisting a young offender to adjust back into their community).

:(ii) &quot;Fair/proportionate accountability with greater dependency and reduced maturity&quot;: During sentencing &quot;proportionality determines the degree of intervention of the sentence&quot;. The court must hold the offender accountable only for the acts committed. Therefore, &quot;accountability is to occur through the imposition of meaningful consequences and measures that will promote the rehabilitation and reintegration of youth into society&quot;. The offender&#x27;s level of maturity is considered when deciding on a response to the offence that is both fair and proportionate.

:(iii) &quot;Enhanced procedural protection, fairness, rights&quot;: These procedural protections are there to guarantee that young people&#x27;s rights are protected and that they are treated fairly. Some of these rights include but are not limited to: right to privacy, right to talk with a lawyer and an adult.
:(iv) &quot;Ensure timely intervention reinforces link between offence and consequence&quot;.

:(v) &quot;Promptness and speed with which persons responsible for this &quot;Act&quot; must act, given young persons&#x27; perception of time.&quot;

===Social values===
Paragraph (c) is meant to reflect social values while taking into account each individual&#x27;s unique situation. It outlines the parameters within which the measures taken against a youth offender are set:

:(i) &quot;Reinforce respect for societal values&quot; by implementing exercises that contribute positively to a youth&#x27;s rehabilitation. 

:(ii) &quot;Encourage repair of harm done to victims and emphasizing their rights&quot;. Furthermore, repair of harm done to the community is also encouraged.

:(iii) &quot;Be meaningful for the individual young person given their needs and level of development and, where appropriate, involve the parents, the extended family, the community and social or other agencies in the young person&#x27;s rehabilitation and reintegration.&quot; The &quot;Act&quot; provides a much bigger role for the parents and the community.

:(iv) &quot;Respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal young persons and of young persons with special requirements.&quot;

===Rights and considerations===
Paragraph (d) describes the special considerations for criminal proceedings against young persons. It highlights four in particular.

:(i) The rights of young persons, such as right &quot;to be heard in the course of and to participate in the processes&quot; and the &quot;special guarantees of their rights and freedoms&quot;

:(ii) The rights of victims. They should be treated &quot;with courtesy, compassion and respect for their dignity and privacy and should suffer the minimum degree of inconvenience as a result of their involvement with the YCJS - youth criminal justice system.&quot;

:(iii) The role of victims. They &quot;should be provided with information about the proceedings and given opportunity to participate and be heard.&quot;

:(iv) The role of parents. The parents should be informed of their child&#x27;s proceedings, and are encouraged to &quot;support them in addressing their offending behaviour.&quot; (vi)

==Extrajudicial measures==

Under Part 1 of the &quot;Act&quot;, extrajudicial measures are used for responding to less serious youth crimes in a timely and effective manner. Police are the first officials to be encountered within the system and possess the power to use discretion in deciding whether to issue a warning, a police caution, or a charge. If the youth agrees, the police can also refer the youth to a program under section 7 of the &quot;Act&quot;. If the police decide to refer the case to the courts, the Crown can choose to issue a Crown caution.

If a warning, caution or referral was issued it means that the police officer has taken no further action on the offence. If a warning, caution, or referral is not appropriate, an extrajudicial sanction may be considered as well.

===Principles===
Section 4 of the &quot;Act&quot; sets out principles that govern the establishment of policies about extrajudicial measures:

# They are often most appropriate to address youth crime;
#They allow for effective intervention focused on correcting offending behaviour;
#They are presumed to be adequate for young persons charged with a non-violent offence and are not guilty of any prior offence and
#They should be used if they are sufficient to hold a young offender accountable and may be used if a young person has previously been dealt with by extrajudicial measures.

===Objectives===
These measures are applied by police and Crown attorneys with the intention that youth can be held liable through non-court measures for their offence(s).

Under Section 5 of the &quot;Act&quot;, objectives of these measures are to:
#Provide an effective and timely response to offending behaviour outside of judicial measures.
#Encourage young persons to acknowledge and repair the harm caused to the victim/community.
#Encourage families and members of the community to get involved in implementing the measures.
#Provide victims with a chance to take part in the decisions relating to the measures and to receive reparation.
#Respect the freedoms of young persons and ensure proportionality to the seriousness of the crime.

These objectives are specially designed so that a wide range of diversionary options are available to achieve an array of objectives and it is important to take into consideration many factors when deciding on a fair response to the offence. For example, if the young person has already started reparation to the harm done to the victim, the person deciding on the type of extrajudicial measure should consider that factor when determining an appropriate response.

===Types of extrajudicial measures===
There are four types of extrajudicial measures (not including extrajudicial sanctions):

#Warnings are informal warnings issued by police officers. They are usually used for minor crimes.
#Police cautions are formal warnings from the police. In some jurisdictions, it is expected that police cautions will be in the form of a letter from the police to the young person and the parents, or they may involve a process in which the young person and the parents are requested to appear at a police station to talk to a senior police officer.
#Crown cautions are similar to police cautions but prosecutors give the caution after the police refer the case to them. In one province where they are currently being used, the caution is in the form of a letter to the young person and the parents.
#Referring to different community

===Extrajudicial sanctions===
An extrajudicial sanction is defined as a type of &quot;extrajudicial measure&quot; used to deal with a young person only if they cannot be adequately dealt by a warning, caution or referral as outlined above. Conditions that dictate this are the seriousness of the offence, the nature and number of previous offences committed by the young person or any other aggravating circumstances. Extrajudicial sanctions examples include restitution or compensation, service to the victim or community, attendance and participating in counselling and treatment programs, etc.

Formerly termed as &quot;alternative measures&quot; under the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot; extrajudicial sanctions are important for they are a good alternative option to the formal court process for the young person. If they comply satisfactorily with the sanction the charge can be dismissed. However, failure to comply or unsatisfactory performance may result in a charge or return to court. The decision whether to apply an extrajudicial sanction lies in with the police officer, Crown Prosecutor, or other officials and in comparison to other types of extrajudicial measures, a more formal set of rules applies to extrajudicial sanctions. Further, although it appears that the charge has &quot;gone away&quot;, if the youth reoffends the sanction can be brought up at the next hearing.

====Restriction on using extrajudicial sanctions====
Extrajudicial sanctions can only be used if:

# Other extrajudicial measures are not suitable: informal warning, police caution, Crown caution or referral to community program(s);
# The program suggested is allowed by the government of that jurisdiction;
# The program is appropriate, considering the young person&#x27;s needs and the interests of society;
# The young person has made an informed consent to participate (the young person must know about the sanction, must be given the right to counsel, must be given an opportunity to consult with counsel, and must consent to its use;
# The young person accepts responsibility for the crime;
# There is sufficient evidence for the Crown to proceed with the charge(s) and prosecution; and
# A parent is notified.

Extrajudicial sanctions cannot be used if:
# The young person denies being involved in the offence;
# The young person wants a trial in court; or
# The young person fails to be allowed into the program

==Youth justice committees==
Section 18(1) of the Youth Justice Committees (YJCs) help in the administering of the &quot;Act&quot; by devolving power to the community. YJCs facilitate interaction between the victim and offender, and recommend appropriate programs/services to treat their situation. Each committee is a group of trained volunteers from the local community. Their main activities include the following:

a. for the youth charged with an offence:
*Recommending an appropriate extrajudicial measure to be used
*Victim support by addressing concerns and mediating between victim and offender
*Ensuring community support by arranging for the use of communal services, and recruiting short-term mentors and supervisors
*Coordinating interaction between the youth criminal justice system and any outside agency/group
b. Reporting to the federal and provincial governments on whether protective measures of the act are followed
c. Advising the federal and provincial governments on policies and procedures related to the youth criminal justice system
d. Informing the public in respect of the YCJA and the youth criminal justice system; 
e. Setting up conferences
f. Any other task assigned by The Attorney General of Canada or a provincial minister

Operating under the paradigm of restorative justice, YJCs aim to &quot;strike the right balance between accountability and community intervention&quot; YJCs are used extensively in Manitoba, Alberta and New Brunswick. A committee&#x27;s activity largely depends on volunteer efforts from its community. Trained members work to create extrajudicial measures for young people, but failure to comply with measures given ultimately results in return to the formal justice system.

==Right to counsel==

===General===
The &quot;Act&quot; in Section 25(1) gives a youth the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, which was amended by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This means that young persons who are arrested or detained for any reason must be told of their right to obtain a lawyer before any lawful procedures are conducted. The youth must also be given the opportunity to obtain this counsel. If the youth does not have a lawyer present at the first court date, the judge must inform the youth of their right of counsel. Before accepting a plea, the court must

# Ensure that the young person understands the charge
# Explain the plea options
# Explain the process of applying a youth sentence

The young person has right to counsel upon arrest or detention, before a voluntary statement, during consideration of extrajudicial sanctions, and at a hearing. If the youth is denied legal aid for any reason, the court can order that counsel be given to the youth- in order to comply with the right to counsel If at any point the parent&#x27;s interests and the youth&#x27;s interests are in conflict, the presiding judge may also order counsel be obtained for the youth Even though right to counsel is guaranteed by the &quot;Act&quot;, studies have shown that youth tend to not take advantage of counsel, leading many to question the validity and authenticity of Section 25(1).

===Appointment of counsel===
The delivery of legal counsel has two primary models: Judicare and Staff delivery model text to display. In judicare delivery model, lawyers in private practice are issued certificates to provide legal aid to clients. In the staff lawyer system, the service is provided by lawyers that are employed directly by the legal aid plan. The proportion of Young offender legal aid is equally divided between the two. Section 25 of the &quot;Act&quot; outlines the young individual&#x27;s right to counsel, which was amended from the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The aim is to protect the youth&#x27;s right to counsel in all stages of the youth justice process and ensure the individual understands the justice process. According to the &quot;Act&quot; section 25 (4): If the young individual is unable to obtain legal assistance or no legal aid program is available, the young offender is able to request counsel. The counsel to represent the young individual is to be appointed by the Attorney General according to the section 25(5) of the Youth Justice Act. For example, if the young individual is unable to afford a lawyer, he or she may request legal aid. If eligible, a lawyer will be appointed by the attorney general.

===Assistance by adult===
The Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms and the &quot;Act&quot; both hold the right to legal representation for youth. The purpose is to provide extensive opportunity for legal advocacy and advice prior to and during the court process. However, when a young person is not represented by counsel at trial or at a hearing, the justice presiding over the case or the youth justice court may allow youth to be assisted by an adult at the request of the young person. For this to occur, the youth court of justice or the review board must find an adult who is deemed to be suitable in assisting the young person. This right is given to make the process for the young person easier, as the young person can obtain adult assistance from someone that they are more familiar with. Despite the fact that section 25(7) does not specify specific requirements for the ideal suitable adult, this tends to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to the specific needs of the young person.

===Statement to youth===
The Statement of Right to Counsel requires that the young person be provided with a written statement that reminds them that they do have the right to request and be represented by legal counsel at any time during the judicial process. Included at various stages of the judicial process, the Statement, ensures that the young person remains alert to their rights, to the continued availability of counsel and to their options for counsel (i.e., Legal Aid). The Statement must be included with appearance notices or summons, arrest warrants, promises to appear, in all notifications of sentence review and also with all undertakings or recognisance that the young person may participate in under the auspices of the officer in charge. It must also be included with other notifications of legal proceedings such as custody continuations, conditional supervision, decision reviews and all youth justice court reviews. The repetition of the document serves as a reminder not only to the young person, but also to those within the judicial system that it is necessary to protect the rights of the young person and guarantee that those rights are upheld throughout the judicial process.

===Explanation appropriate to age and understanding===
Every accused person in Canada has the right to be informed of their rights and what they are being charged of, according to the legal rights of the Arrest and Detention section of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. According to section 146 (2) (b) of the &quot;Act&quot;, Young persons under the age of 18 must have their rights explained by the officer in a language appropriate to their age and level of understanding. Therefore, the officer must assess the accused youth&#x27;s ability to understand their rights before attaining a statement from the youth. It is imperative that the officer states the rights to the youth in a manner that he or she fully understands due to the fact that the courts will not assess whether the child fully understood the rights inform to them by the officer but whether or not the officer explained their rights at a level appropriate to their age and understanding.

Officers employ such techniques as having the youth repeat or summarize in their own words the rights that were transmitted to them to avoid having any testimonies made by the accused youth waived by the courts.

===Right to counsel===
The fundamental paradigm shift from the &quot;Youth Offenders Act&quot; to the &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot; involves the view that deviant youth are now viewed as offenders responsible for their actions. In a similar comparison to that of adults, the youth are encouraged to obtain legal counsel. The youth justice court or review board is required as a legal implication to advise the young person of their right to counsel. The following are some typical situations that warrant such advice: at a hearing for the youth when determining to detain or release the individual, at a youth&#x27;s trial, and in situations where the custody of the youth is in question such as conditional supervision and decision reviews. The youth justice court or review board is more specifically required to provide a reasonable opportunity to obtain such counsel and this act is viewed as a mandated judicial measure. A specific difference in comparison to adult courts is the fact that it prohibits criminal proceedings against a youth without the consent of the Attorney General. In terms of adult proceedings, it is possible for members of the public to commence proceedings without the authorization of police and the Crown Attorney; however, that is not the case with youth. While comparing the &quot;Youth Offenders Act&quot; to the &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot;, the former focuses more on a youth&#x27;s choice to retain counsel and the role of lawyers in the criminal justice system. In terms of the JDA, more focus was placed on a youth being viewed as a misguided individual who required guidance from the courts.

Sections 25(4) and (10) allow young people to obtain the same rights as adults, in terms of legal counsel, consent, etc. It is also necessary that young persons be given the right to consult a parent or other adult in some circumstances.

Subsection 25(10) of the &quot;Act&quot; permits provinces to establish a program for the recovery of costs of a young person&#x27;s counsel from the young person or the parents of that young person. Therefore, young people are represented by permanent salaried legal aid lawyers or, as per the specified choice, by a private lawyer who accepts the legal aid mandate payable according to the pre-established rates. If a young offender is ineligible he is represented by a private lawyer at a cost agreed upon by the youth and/or his parents and the lawyer.

==Notice to parents==
Under the &quot;Act&quot;, in case of the arrest or detention of a young person, the officer in charge must give notice to a parent either orally or in writing as soon as they possibly can under section 26(1). The notice must include under section 26(6) the following information: (a) the name of the young person (b) the charge against the young person and (c) a statement that the young person has the right to be represented by counsel. In addition, if summons, appearance of notice or promise to appear is issued in respect of a young person, the parent must be given notice in writing in person or via mail under section 26(2). Both sections 26(1) and 26(2) are subject to subsection 26(4), which states that if the whereabouts of the parents of the young person are not available, notice may be given to an adult who the person giving the notice considers appropriate. If there is a failure to give notice to a parent upon the arrest of a young person all proceedings continue and are not considered invalid under this act.

==Arrest and detention==
Youths may be arrested by the police for more serious offences. The rights expressed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms apply to youths and adults.

Youths and adults have the right to obtain immediate legal counsel of their own choice upon arrest or detention. The Youth offender also has the right to have their parent(s) or guardian(s) present during questioning. Upon arrest or detainment, these rights must be explained in clear and understandable language.

If the police have violated the above rights, the charges may be dismissed by a judge or any statements made to the police may be ruled inadmissible by the judge in court.

Presumptive offences were found to be unconstitutional and are no longer included in the &quot;Act&quot;. A presumptive offence is an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by a young person who has attained the age of fourteen years. An adult sentence can be imposed on a young person who is found guilty of an offence for which an adult can be sentenced to imprisonment for more than two years if the offence was committed after a young person is fourteen years of age.
Presumptive offence may be used under one of the following charges: first-degree or second-degree murder, attempt to commit murder, manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault. Other serious offences can fall within presumptive offence if it is the third conviction for such an offence.
The age of fourteen may sometimes be raised in a province where the Lieutenant Governor in council has fixed the age greater than fourteen.
Youths who are 12 or 13 at the time of the offence may be sentenced in the same way, only for the following: first degree or second degree murder or manslaughter.

==Trial procedures==
Trials for both adults and youths follow the same rules for evidence and are equally formal. 

==Privacy==
Section 110 of the &quot;Act&quot; outlines privacy in relation to the identity of young offenders, access to their criminal records, and disclosure of their personal or trial information.

The &quot;Act&quot; trial information can be published in media or print but identifying information (i.e., name) about young offenders cannot. This publication ban exists to prevent stigmatization of young offenders, which has been found to hinder the rehabilitation of youth. Furthermore, the identity of youth victims cannot be published for the same reasons. 
Breaking the publication ban is a criminal offence. It is unknown whether publication of identifying information on social networking sites like Facebook is a violation of the ban, which has been the source of controversy.

The ban is lifted in respect to any adult sentences the young person receives, and can be otherwise lifted only under exceptional circumstances, including:

*if the identifying information is necessary for the capture of a young offender;
*or if the young offender requests for their name to be published. Youth requests for publication are subject to judicial discretion.

Youth criminal records cannot be viewed by anyone other than criminal justice officials (e.g. lawyers) and only within particular time frames from the offence.

Disclosure (&quot;the communication of information other than by way of publication&quot; of youth information is banned under the &quot;Act&quot;. Communicating information about youth offenders through disclosure is a criminal offence

==Detention prior to sentencing section 29==
Under the &quot;Act&quot;, prior to conviction, detention is prohibited and deemed unnecessary. One of the new provisions of the &quot;Act&quot; is to limit the use of pre-trial detention and to promote alternatives to incarceration. Under the &quot;Youth Offenders Act&quot;, pre-trial detention was on the rise and Canada, out of the western countries, had one of the highest youth incarceration rates. Not only was the use of pre-trial detention high, it also varied widely across the provinces. Pre-trial detention is not meant to be punitive, but research found negative outcomes associated with it as well, such as depravity of freedom and seclusion from the outside world. Many youth in custody prior to their sentencing were also found guilty more often than youths not in custody. The inconsistent use of pre-trial detention and negative connotations were cause enough for revision.

==Purpose of sentencing==

===Purpose===
The fundamental purpose in the sentencing of young persons pursuant to the &quot;Act&quot; is to strike the best possible balance between the interests of the young person and the interests of society. The sentencing judge will also endeavour to impose a sentence that encourages the youth to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions.[s.3, s.38 YCJA]

Canadian appellate courts and the Supreme Court of Canada have repeatedly affirmed the principle that young persons convicted of crimes must be sentenced differently from adults. A notable example is the Ontario decision of &quot;R v D.T&quot;. &#x27;2006 OJ 112&#x27; (Citation is wrong) where the Court asserted that a separate youth sentencing process is fundamental to Canadian societal notions of justice.

In &quot;R v C.D. / C.D.K&quot;[2005 SCC 78], the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that youths will receive the most favourable interpretation available of the &quot;Act&quot; sentencing provisions . In &quot;C.D / C.D.K.&quot;, the Court ruled that &#x27;violent crime&#x27; as defined in s.39 of the &quot;Act&quot; did not include arson; the offender was thereby entitled to a more lenient disposition.[ibid, 85]

Since the enactment of the &quot;Act&quot; in 2003, a greater number of young persons charged with criminal offences have received the benefit of &quot;diversion&quot; that was the practice under the former &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot;.[Bala (2007), 7]. Diversion refers to the broad range of non-criminal sanctions, including community service that if satisfactorily completed by the youth, the subject charge is withdrawn.

===Committal to custody===
Section 39 (1) of the &quot;Act&quot; maintains that a custodial sentence should not be imposed on young offenders unless certain mandatory conditions outlined in the section are satisfied. The purpose of this section is to provide specific guidance to judges who are considering imposing a custodial sentence with the principal focus of reducing Canada&#x27;s &quot;over-reliance on the incarceration of non-violent young persons&quot;. Section 39 (1) (a) specifically places restrictions on the use of custodial sentences for non-violence offences unless the offender has a history of failing to comply with noncustodial sentences and has created a risk to public safety with those violations, has an extensive pattern of non-violent offending, or other exceptional circumstances. In addition to satisfying at least one of the conditions of section 39(1), the courts must also ensure the balance of section 39 when considering a custodial sentence of a non-violent offence. Also, the judges must take into account any rehabilitative concerns that would alter the nature and reduce the severity of the sentence by mitigating factors. For an example, courts must be certain to not impose a severe sentence in situations of rehabilitative of child welfare concerns. For an example, a custodial sentence should not be imposed to achieve rehabilitation purposes or to tackle such social circumstances such as lack of housing or an abusive home environment.

Section 39 of the &quot;Act&quot; restricts the use of custodial sentences for young persons&lt;ref name=&quot;Youth Court Statistics, 2003/04&quot;&gt;Statcan.gc.ca , Thomas, Jennifer. Statistics Canada: Catalogue no. 85-002-XPE, Vol. 25(4): 7. Retrieved July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the young person should not be taken into custody unless the young person or their offence meet certain criteria. Subsection (1) (d) defines one of these criteria and states that custodial sentences may be used in those exceptional cases where the youth has committed an indictable offence. Further, the nature of the indictable offence must be such that imposing a non-custodial sentence would not fulfil the purpose and principles of sentencing as outlined in section 38 of the &quot;Act&quot;. Section 38 of the &quot;Act&quot; states that the young person is to be held accountable for their actions and rehabilitated into society. Thus, as defined in 39 (1) (d), custodial sentences and imprisonment and to be used only in response to offences that are indictable and when non-custodial sentences are inappropriate with regards to the circumstances and the nature of the offence.Overall the YCJA is an effective program used for the youths.

===Alternatives to custody===
39.(2) &quot;If any of 39(1)(a) to (c) apply, a youth justice court shall not impose a custodial sentence under section 42 unless the court has considered all alternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing that are reasonable in the circumstances, and determined that there is not a reasonable alternative, or combination of alternatives, that is in accordance with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.
39.(3) &quot;In determining whether there is a reasonable alternative to custody, a youth justice court shall consider submissions relating to:

(a) the alternatives to custody that are available;

(b) the likelihood that the young person will comply with a non-custodial sentence, taking into account their compliance with previous non-custodial sentences; and

(c) the alternatives to custody that have been used in respect of young persons for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.

The above entails that even though a &#x27;serious offence&#x27; was committed by a youth, it does not automatically equate to time in custody. The presiding official in a youth justice court must review all options other than custody by utilizing the factors outlined in 39 (3). Specifically section 39 (2) prohibits the court from imposing custody unless all alternatives have been considered. The reason for said sections within the &quot;Act&quot; is to reduce the use of custody as a sentencing option, and consequently the number of youth in custody, and to ensure that the most intrusive response to youth offending is only used in serious cases. The inclusion of these sections displays a stark difference between the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot; and the &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot; as the former did not have such clear preconditions that had to be satisfied prior to the imposition of a custodial sentence and thus large numbers of youth were incarcerated under the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot;.

===Reports for sentencing hearings===
Reports for sentencing hearings are used in more serious cases in order to assist in determining an appropriate sentence. The most frequently used report for sentencing hearings is the pre-sentence report which is outlined in section 40. The judge ultimately decides whether a report is necessary, though the crown may request the report and the defence counsel may argue against the issuing of a pre-sentence report. All custodial sentences require a pre-sentencing report. A pre-sentencing report is conducted by a government employee who interviews the youth and any significant influences including family members, peers and other important persons who may contribute to their report. This report is a historical outline which may include information regarding the youth&#x27;s family background, school history, attitude toward their offence, willingness to engage in available community services, interview with the victim and potentially a suggestive sentence. The pre-sentence report is given to the judge, prosecutor and defence lawyers as well as the youth and any involved parent or guardian before the sentencing hearing.

====Restitution of property====
The &quot;Act&quot; requires that the personal circumstances of the young person be considered before ordering a sentence. Custodial sentences are reserved for very serious offences (e.g., murder, manslaughter). The &quot;Act&quot; favours noncustodial sentencing options whenever possible in order to reduce the youth incarceration rates.

Restitution of property is a noncustodial sentencing option. According to this sentence, the young person is ordered to make restitution—that is, pay back the equivalent amount of the property obtained by the young person to the lawful owner of the property. The youth justice court can fix the time and term of payment.

Other considerations during this sentence include:
* Allowing more time for completion of the sentence.
* Notifying the person to whom the restitution will be made about the sentencing order.
* The obtained property must be in possession of the young person at the time, and must lawfully belong to the owner of the property.

===Sentencing principles===

====Comparison with adult sentences====
Under sentencing principle (3) (a) of the &quot;Act&quot;, the sentencing of a youth&#x27;s punishment should not by any means be harsher or surpass that of the punishment for an adult who has been found guilty of committing the same crime as the youth The reason for this sentencing principle was to eliminate discrepancies that were prevalent in the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot;. It was formed on the basis that youth under the Young Offenders Act were receiving longer sentences than adults for the same offences. In R. v. C.D.; [2005] a youth pleaded guilty to arson, breach of a recognisance, and the possession of a weapon. He received a light sentence of six months of deferred custody due to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. Appeals against this case, state that the youth has committed an indictable offence for which an adult would be imprisoned for a period of two or more years.

====Similarity====
Under the sentencing principle 38 (2)(b)of the &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot;, the court requires that the sentence imposed must be similar in the region when young offenders are found guilty of the same crime under similar circumstances. This means that there should be a general level of consistency in sentences for young offenders who are guilty of the same crime. This principle addresses the unfair disparity of youth sentences, by stating that sentence should be similar, not necessarily the same Allowing such individualization makes the sentence meaningful for the youth involved and points at any rehabilitative needs required by the young offender. These sentencing principles are meant to be imposed in accordance to additional principles listed out in section 38 (3) which state that in determining the youth sentence, the court shall take in account: the degree of participation of subjected youth in offence, the degree of harm inflicted and intentions of offender, any reparations provided to victim or community by youth offender, any time spent in detention by youth due to offence, any other case of guilt found against the offender, and whether there is any additional aggravating or mitigating information against the offender that might influence the sentence read otherwise.

====Proportionality====
The sentencing principle 38 (2)(c)under the &quot;Act&quot; states &#x27;the sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the young person for that offence&#x27; Sentencing principles clearly explain the basis that establish fair and justifiable sentences. Under the Youth Criminal Justice Act punishments are not only limited to jail imprisonment in addition extrajudicial measures are taken such as community services and probation. The punishment is given to the offender according to the gravity of his/her offence. For young offenders, cases are viewed individually and sentencing is determined distinctively for different cases. Thus the more serious the offence is the more severe the punishment will be. Proportionality here means the size or the degree of the offence, thus the punishment should be proportional to the crime committed. So a young offender who commits murder will be severely punished compared to someone who steals. How serious was the offence, the offender&#x27;s level of participation and their intention, the harm done to the victim and the previous findings of guilt are taken into account by the court to determine the sentencing of the offender.

====Substitute to custody====
Under the sentencing principle 38 2(d), the court is required to consider a substitute for the custody of young persons, while paying special attention to aboriginal offenders. In addition, the section also states that special concern should be given to youth by taking into account the gender, racial, and cultural differences. By responding to the needs of young aboriginal offenders, the focus of this section directs the court to use less harsh custodial sentences except when the offender poses a great threat to the public. &quot;Special attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders is mandated by the-minute amendments to the YCJA initiated by the Senate&quot;. An example of this is seen in R. V. D.R.D. (2006), in which a fourteen-year-old boy was pleaded guilty of trafficking and was appealing his sentence for drug charges. He was convicted to one year probation because the judge maintained that he is an extreme aboriginal youth which is a risk to the society.

===Sentencing options===
Sentencing Option 42 (2) (a)
Sentencing option 42(2) under the &quot;Act&quot; is to reprimand the young person. Reprimand is a severe reproof or rebuke in this case by a person of authority.
Sentencing Option 42 (2)(b)
When a young person is found guilty, through a youth justice court, the judge may refer to section 42(2)(b) under the &quot;Act&quot;. Under section 42(2)(b) a young person, when guilt is found, may be discharged absolutely. This discharge is dependent on the best interest of the young offender without being in contrast with the best interests of the public. An absolute discharge, under section 42(2)(b), in accordance with 82(2), constitutes a termination of the sentence of a young person in respect of an offence in which a young person is found guilty. As opposed to conditional discharges, absolute discharges do not carry sanctions of probation or any other condition that the court may find appropriate (fair sanctions with meaningful consequences)

Sentencing Option 42 (2)(c)
Sentencing option 42 (2) c under the &quot;Act&quot; states that a convicted young offender can be discharged on any conditions the court decides to be appropriate. This may require the young offender to report to and be supervised by the provincial director. Conditions for a discharge might also include undergoing counselling, doing community service work or donation to a charity. Once the duration of the discharge has passed and the conditions of the probation have been successfully followed, the discharge becomes absolute, i.e., the youth will not be viewed as the offender although the record can be used for three years after finding of guilt in the event that there is a subsequent conviction. However, if the young person fails to abide by the conditions of probation, the offender can be convicted of the original offence and be sentenced.

Sentencing Options 42(2)(c)
If a young person is found guilty, &quot;By order direct that the young person be discharged on any conditions that the court considers appropriate and may require the young person to report to and be supervised by the provincial director&quot;. As an order under conditional release, the young offender is required to follow certain rules set out by a probation order for a specific length of time; when the time duration has passed, the release becomes absolute. The considerations for conditional discharge must be in the best interest of the offender and not contrary to public interest. The purpose of this section is to reduce the rate of incarceration of young people and promote rehabilitation and reintegration into society. If any condition is violated by the young offender, they will be required to appear in front of the court again at which point they may be incarcerated. Examples of conditions placed on the young offender are as follows: 
*Abstain from alcohol or drug use
*Abstain from owning, possessing or carrying a weapon
*Perform community service
*Participate in a treatment program

Sentencing Options 42(2)(d)
If a young person is found guilty of an offence in a youth justice court, the judge may impose a sentence under section 42 of the &quot;Act&quot;. The purpose of sentencing under the &quot;Act&quot; &quot;is to hold a young person accountable for an offence by imposing fair sanctions with meaningful consequences.&quot; Under section 42(2)(d) it states that a young offender may not have a fine against them exceeding $1000 to be paid at the time and on the terms that the court may fix. This entails that the courts must have regard to the means of how the young offender will pay, as well as the ability for the young offender to be granted more time to complete the sentence. The offender then has the following options, he or she may be ordered to pay a victim fine surcharge (up to 15%) which contributes to assisting the victims of the crime. Or, the province may establish a program under which the young offender can discharge a fine under para, the percentage imposed under s53(1) or Victim fine surcharge under s 53(2) which is only attainable by earning credits for work in the program of the province the young offender resides.

Sentencing Options 42 (2)(e)
Section 42(2)(e) under the &quot;Act&quot; states that the young person must pay to the other person at the time/terms that the court fixes the amount of compensation due to loss of income/support, damage of property etc.

Sentencing Options 42(2)(h)
Section 42 (2) (h) under the &quot;Act&quot; is a non- custodial sentencing option that states that the Youth Justice Court (YJC) may order a young offender to compensate the victim in kind or by personal service for a damage, loss, or injury suffered. Under 42 (2) (h), an order may be made under section 42 (2) (g) where the young offender is to monetarily compensate the purchaser of a stolen property since the stolen property had to be returned to the owner, or section 42 (2) (e) where the young offender is to monetarily compensate the victim for personal injury or property that was damaged. The YJC may arrange the times and terms of compensation that is ordered. However, the compensation must not conflict with the young offender&#x27;s regular schedule of education and work. The order to provide personal service to the victim can be assigned for any number of hours but is limited up to 240 hours. The hours of service ordered can be completed within one year from the date which the sentencing option was ordered; however the YJC may allow an extension of time to fully complete the sentence, on application of the young offender. Although the YJC may order the young offender to compensate the victim by providing personal service, the consent of the compensated is required.

Sentencing Options 42(2)(i)
In the &quot;Act&quot;, under Sentencing options 42 (2) (i), the court has the option to order a young person to complete community service for a punishment. The amount of community service must not go beyond 240 hours of service which can be completed within 12 months. The community service must be approved by the provincial director of the youth justice court or a person designated by the youth justice court. The purpose of sentencing under section 42 is to protect society by holding the young person accountable for their actions by giving the right amount of punishment which can promote their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
This type of sentencing is a non custodial sentencing option which is the goal of the Youth Criminal Justice act to not rely on the over use of incarceration for non violent youths. It also gives out different options which can be costumed to different individual cases that can give out the best solution possible. These are the innovations that were created due to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, it helps youth to get the best rehabilitation to continue on their lives in society.

Sentencing Options 42(2)(k)
Section 42(2)(k) under the &quot;Act&quot; allows a young person to be placed on Probation (as specified by conditions and other matters related to probation orders under sections 55 and 56) for a specified period of time not exceeding two years. Orders may range from being supervised by the provincial director; remain within the territorial jurisdiction of one or more courts; attending school; or having to reside at a place specified by the provincial director. The Youth Justice Court prescribes these conditions as an order so the young person will learn to be of good behaviour and appear before the youth justice court when required to do so.

Probation is the sentence most frequently imposed by youth justice courts in Canada, as the conditions laid out are directly related to the young offenders criminal behaviour. This helps the offender to see the harm caused by their actions to the society and victims, and why they should not commit such crimes again. If a young offender fails to comply with the probation order, they can possibly be charged with breach of probation. But th &quot;Act&quot; does not require the charges be laid; rather, it states that an alternative approach is recommended. Such as a review of probation orders thus providing an opportunity to make changes to conditions that can be more effective in promoting the rehabilitation and reintegration of the young person.

Sentencing Options 42 (2) (l)
To ensure that a young offenders illegal actions are followed by consequences that are &quot;(1)just; (2)have meaningful consequences for the youth; (3) and promote the rehabilitation and reintegration of the youth into society&quot; the &quot;Act&quot; has instilled several sentencing options.

According to Section 42(2), the twelfth sentencing option for youth is the placement in an (l) intensive support and supervision program. This non-custodial sentencing option was introduce to the act along with options such as reprimand as well as non-residential programs or attendance orders.

This sentencing option is meant to be an alternative for custody, and was implemented to decrease high rates of custody caused by the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot;. The young offender receives support and supervision from their community in hopes that they will alter their behaviour. The intent of this sentencing option is to provide more support than probation and is often used to promote the use of community-based and rehabilitation sentences.

This option encourages the rehabilitation of the youth and should target the specific needs or problems that seem to have contributed to their illegal behaviour.

This sentencing option will only take place if the government has established programs and the courts have received approval of the provincial director. If not available, a probation order will be used along with various conditions to ensure the support and supervision of the youth in question.

Sentencing Options 42 (2) (m)

This new sentencing option requires, at specific times, a young offender to attend court sanctioned programs. Over a six-month period a maximum of 240 hours that can be assigned.

This sentencing option is a nonresidential program that may be used as an alternative to custody and may be focused at specific high-risk times of day, such as when the youth may be unattended and unsupervised.

A Pilot attendance centre program in Ontario has reported considerable success and was well received by Ontario youth court judges.

This measure may only occur if and attendance order program is available in the province. Provinces may decide not to implement this provision of the &quot;Act&quot; and are not required to make this option available.

Due to potential high costs associated with this program, provinces may be eligible for additional federal funding.

In the absence of such programs, a youth court judge may achieve similar ends by attaching specific conditions to a probation order handed down to a young person. The judge may also (as a condition of probation) require the young person to attend community programs.

The overall goal of attendance programs is to supervise young persons at times when they may be more prone to commit crimes, such as when left unattended by parents.

Sentencing Options 42(2)(n)
The &quot;Act&quot; states that all custodial sentences must have a mandatory period of supervision in the community. The rationale behind the community supervision order is to provide support and supervision for the young offender&#x27;s transition from custody back into their community.

When a judge sentences a young offender to a custody and supervision order under Section 42(2) (n) of the &quot;Act&quot;, it means that the young offender must serve time in custody, followed by a period of supervision in the community. The supervision order may be up to half as long as the custodial period. This sentencing option is for convicted youth criminals who are convicted for crimes other than murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault or who are in custody as a result of an IRCS (Intensive Rehabilitative Custody and Supervision) order.

The length of the custodial sentence and supervision order combined must not exceed two or three years, depending on the type of offence. Offences other than for which an adult would receive life imprisonment are subject to a two-year maximum for the young offender. Offences for which an adult would receive life imprisonment, except murder, are subject to a three-year maximum for the young offender.

If a condition laid out by the judge or other officials is broken, or not met appropriately while under supervision in the community, reviews are held which determine whether the young offender&#x27;s conditions should be changed or if he or she should be sent back into custody.

Sentencing Options 42(2)(o)
Section 42(2)(o) of the &quot;Act&quot; establishes the length of time to be served in custody or in community supervision for cases of attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault. The total serving time for these periods cannot exceed 3 years since life imprisonment is imposed on adults responsible for these offences. Under the &quot;Act&quot;, murder is the only offence that must result in a custody and supervision order. The maximum serving time is 10 years for first-degree murder and 7 years for second-degree murder.

Section 42(2) (o) also asserts the ability of the court to decide the duration of conditional supervision. Thus the supervision period does not have to be half the period of custody. This condition provides more liberty for the courts to respond with an appropriate sentence to serious offences. If a young person violates a condition during the supervision period, the provincial director may place the offender back into custody.

For other statutory considerations, the supervision part of the order includes mandatory and discretionary conditions (s. 105). Also, the amount of time served in custody by a young person can be extended via AG or provincial director&#x27;s request to the YJC. However, the added duration of custody may not surpass the remainder of the youth sentence (s. 104).

Sentencing Options 42(2)(p)
Under section 42(2)(p) of the &quot;Act&quot;, a judge may impose a deferred custody and supervision order as a sentencing option. A deferred custody and supervision order means that the young offender will not go into custody but will serve their sentence under supervision in the community with a set of strict conditions. If these conditions are not followed, then the conditions may be changed and the young person may be ordered to serve the balance of the sentence in custody. 
The order will be made if the offence committed is not a serious, violent one such as murder or aggravated assault, and if the young person has not committed an indictable offence that an adult would be imprisoned for, for more than two years. The order will be for six months or less and must be considered a just sanction that has meaningful consequences and will promote the young offender&#x27;s rehabilitation and reintegration into society and contribute to the long-term protection of the public. 
The order will include both strict mandatory and optional conditions that the judge deems appropriate and which fall under subsection 105(2) and 105(3). These conditions will include reporting to the provincial director, attending school and/or working, not possessing weapons, abiding by curfews, reporting information changes and others.

Sentencing Options 42(2)(q)
The &quot;Act&quot; section 42 (2) (q) outlines the following pertaining to custody and supervision for 1st and 2nd degree murder Offenders found guilty of 1st degree murder will get a maximum sentence of 10 years, including a maximum custody period of 6 years and a period of conditional supervision in the community. Offenders found guilty of 2nd Degree Murder will get a 7-year maximum sentence including a maximum custody period of 4 years and a period of conditional supervision in the community. Other statutory considerations are that the Attorney General or a provincial director may apply to extend the length of time the young person will spend in custody. The extension may not exceed the remainder of the youth sentence. At least one month prior to the expiration of the custodial portion of the sentence, the YJC sets conditions of the young person&#x27;s conditional supervision

The aforementioned sentences are not guaranteed as the Crown could recommend a harsher adult sentence if the offence meets certain requirements Adult Sentence) When the &quot;Act&quot; was introduced the aspect that was publicized was &quot;to respond more firmly and effectively to the small number of the most serious, violent young offenders&quot; because the public was losing confidence in the youth justice system This was the reason for the harsh penalties for first- and second- degree murder, however, overall, the &quot;Act&quot; has decreased the number of youths within jails for non-violent offences substantially.

Sentencing Options 42(2)(r).
This section provides that a judge may issue an intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order. This sentence is intended to provide treatment for serious violent offenders. The court may only issue this order if any of the following criteria are met:
* the young person has been found guilty of murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault, or a third serious violent offence
* the young person is found to be suffering from a mental or psychological disorder
* an individualized treatment plan for the young person has been developed
* the provincial director has determined that an intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision program is an available and suitable option

This section applies to young people ages twelve to seventeen as long as one or more of these conditions are met. The Youth Justice Court must specify the time period the order is applicable for. The maximum period for an intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order is 2 years, unless the adult penalty for the offence is imprisonment for life, in those cases the maximum period is 3 years. The only other exceptions occur in the case of:

* 1st Degree Murder: maximum period is 10 years including a maximum custody period of 6 years and a period of supervision in the community
* 2nd Degree Murder: The maximum period is 7 years including a maximum custody period of 4 years and a period of supervision in the community

Section 55 (2) (g)
When the youth is sentenced to probation he or she is subject to certain conditions that may be imposed by the judge Under Section 55 (2) (g) the young offender may be told to &quot;reside at a place that the provincial director may specify&quot; This condition follows 2 other requirements that the young offender also needs to obey by a) keep the peace and be of good behaviour; and b) appear by the youth justice court when required by the court to do so this stated in Section 55 (1). The probation conditions follow those stipulated under section 42(2)(k) or (l). This means the director has the power to indicate where they want you to live, moving you from one area to the next depending on the circumstances surrounding the young offender&#x27;s situation.

Section 59: Review of Non-Custodial Youth Sentences
Under the &quot;Young Offender&#x27;s Act&quot;, approximately 20% of custody sentences were charged based on &quot;failure to comply&quot; issues surrounding probation orders The &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot; revised these procedures recognizing that most issues concerning the violation of probation conditions were not criminal acts themselves and that in doing so, were compromising the integrity of the justice system itself. Therefore, the &quot;Act&quot; considers a review, rather than a charge, as a means of reducing the reliance on incarceration while being as fair as possible to the offender in assessing the seriousness of an offence

The &quot;Act&quot; reveals that a review, &quot;can be issued at any time after six months of the initial youth sentence or, with leave of a youth justice court judge&quot; (56). Also, reviews, in most cases, are exempt from those offenders who are charge with an offence outlined in section 42 of the &quot;Act&quot;. The full grounds for review are revealed under section 59.2 and are as follows:

*(a) on the ground that the circumstances that led to the youth sentence have changed materially;
*(b) on the ground that the young person in respect of whom the review is to be made is unable to comply with or is experiencing serious difficulty in complying with the terms of the youth sentence;
*(c) on the ground that the young person in respect of whom the review is to be made has contravened a condition of an order made under paragraph 42(2)(k) or (l) without reasonable excuse;
*(d) on the ground that the terms of the youth sentence are adversely affecting the opportunities available to the young person to obtain services, education or employment; or
*(e) on any other ground that the youth justice court considers appropriate

===Adult sentence===
If a young person was at least 14 years old at the time of the offence, and was found guilty of an offence for which an adult would be liable to receive more than two years imprisonment, the crown may seek an adult sentence. In order for an adult sentence to be imposed, the crown must satisfy the youth court that:

# The presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness of the young person has been rebutted in the case, and
# No available youth sentence could hold the young person accountable

A young person always carries the presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness, even for serious offences like first-degree murder. Therefore, the burden is always on the crown to demonstrate that the young person was acting at the moral sophistication and maturity of an adult at the time of the offence. In the past, this burden was inverted for certain &quot;presumptive offences&quot;, which meant that the young person was deemed to be as morally blameworthy as an adult unless they could prove otherwise. But in 2008, the Supreme Court held those provisions unconstitutional in its seminal decision &quot;R v DB&quot;. Prior to the end of the regime, a &quot;presumptive offence&quot; was defined as murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, and aggravated sexual assault, as well as other &quot;serious violent offences&quot; in some circumstances.

There were a few important changes to &quot;Act&quot; compared to the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot;, for example, the transfer process from a youth court to an adult court is eliminated. Instead, the youth court first determines whether or not the young person is guilty of the offence, and then, under certain circumstances, the youth court may impose an adult sentence,

===Serious violent offences===
The &quot;Act&quot; defines a &quot;serious violent offence&quot; as an offence in the commission of which a young person causes or attempts to cause serious bodily harm. Previously, a &quot;serious violent offence&quot; could become a presumptive offence if the young person had previously committed two violent offences. If a young person is charged for a serious violent offence, they could be sentenced to an &quot;intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order&quot;. It is an individualized treatment plan. 

The court can make this order in specific circumstances:

*If the young person has been found guilty of murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault or has committed at least two serious violent offences in the past,
*The young person is suffering from a mental or psychological disorder or an emotional disturbance,
*There are reasonable grounds to believe that the treatment plan might reduce the risk of the young person repeating the offence or committing other presumptive offences, and
*An appropriate program is available and the young person is suitable for admission.

===Breach of probation===
Section 137 of the &quot;Act&quot; outlines the definitions and consequences of failing to comply with a sentence or disposition, in other words, a breach of probation. It states that anyone failing to comply with their probation order is guilty of a punishable offence on a summary conviction. These orders can include failure to report to and be supervised by the provincial director when on probation, failure to perform community service plus many more stated in section 42(2) of the act. If a breach of probation occurs, the offender may be incarcerated provided it is not their first probation violation, and they harmed, or created a risk to, public safety in breaching their probation.

Differences in breach of probation in the &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot; versus &quot;Youth Offenders Act&quot;

The &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot; raised concern that too many young people were being incarcerated for offences not directly harming the community, but for failure to comply with the terms of probation. The &quot;Act&quot; recognizes that youths have a hard time complying with limits to behaviour and are deserving of a second chance. Since the &quot;Act&quot; was enacted, the number of charges of probation violation has remained similar while the number of cases has declined.

<text>Youth is the time of life when one is young. The word, youth, can also mean the time between childhood and adulthood (maturity), but it can also refer to one&#x27;s peak, in terms of health or the period of life known as being a young adult. Youth is also defined as &quot;the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one, who is young&quot;. Its definitions of a specific age range varies, as youth is not defined chronologically as a stage that can be tied to specific age ranges; nor can its end point be linked to specific activities, such as taking unpaid work, or having sexual relations.

Youth is an experience that may shape an individual&#x27;s level of dependency, which can be marked in various ways according to different cultural perspectives. Personal experience is marked by an individual&#x27;s cultural norms or traditions, while a youth&#x27;s level of dependency means the extent to which they still rely on their family emotionally and economically.

== Terminology and definitions ==


=== General ===
Around the world, the English terms &quot;youth&quot;, &quot;adolescent&quot;, &quot;teenager&quot;, &quot;kid&quot;, &quot;youngster&quot; and &quot;young person&quot; often mean the same thing, but they are occasionally differentiated. &quot;Youth&quot; can be referred to as the time of life, when one is young. The meaning may in some instances also include childhood. &quot;Youth&quot; also identifies a particular mindset of attitude, as in &quot;He is very &quot;youth&quot;ful&quot;. For certain uses, such as employment statistics, the term also sometimes refers to individuals from the ages of up to 21. However, the term &quot;adolescence&quot; refers to a specific age range during a specific developmental period in a person&#x27;s life, unlike youth, which is a socially constructed category.

The United Nations defines &quot;youth&quot; as persons between the ages of roughly 12 and 24, with all UN statistics based on this range, the UN states education as a source for these statistics. The UN also recognizes that this varies without prejudice to other age groups listed by member states such as 18–30. A useful distinction within the UN itself can be made between teenagers (i.e. those between the ages of 13 and 19) and young adults (those between the ages of 20 and 24). While seeking to impose some uniformity on statistical approaches, the UN is aware of contradictions between approaches in its own statutes. Hence, under the 15–24 definition (introduced in 1981) children are defined as those under the age of (someone 12 and younger) while under the 1979 Convention on the Rights of the Child, those under the age of 18 are regarded as children. The UN also states they are aware that several definitions exist for youth within UN entities such as Youth Habitat 15–32, NCSL 12-24, and African Youth Charter 15–35.

On November 11, 2020, the State Duma of the Russian Federation approved a project to raise the cap on the age of young people from 30 to 35 years (the range now extending from 14 to 35 years).

Although linked to biological processes of development and aging, &quot;youth&quot; is also defined as a social position that reflects the meanings different cultures and societies give to individuals between childhood and adulthood. The term in itself when referred to in a manner of social position can be ambiguous when applied to someone of an older age with very low social position; potentially when still dependent on their guardians. Scholars argue that age-based definitions have not been consistent across cultures or times and that thus it is more accurate to focus on social processes in the transition to adult independence for defining youth.

:&quot;This world demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the life of ease.&quot; – Robert Kennedy

Youth is the stage of constructing the self-concept. The self-concept of youth is influenced by variables such as peers, lifestyle, gender, and culture. It is a time of a person&#x27;s life when their choices are most likely to affect their future.

=== Other definitions ===
In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the term &quot;youth&quot; is associated with young men from 12 to 30 or 35 years of age. Youth in Nigeria includes all members of the Federal Republic of Nigeria aged 18–35. Many African girls experience youth as a brief interlude between the onset of puberty and marriage and motherhood. But in urban settings, poor women are often considered youth much longer, even if they bear children outside of marriage. Varying culturally, the gender constructions of youth in Latin America and Southeast Asia differ from those of sub-Saharan Africa. In Vietnam, widespread notions of youth are sociopolitical constructions for both sexes between the ages of 15 and 35.

In Brazil, the term &quot;youth&quot; refers to people of both sexes from 15 to 29 years old. This age bracket reflects the influence on Brazilian law of international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO). It is also shaped by the notion of adolescence that has entered everyday life in Brazil through a discourse on children&#x27;s rights.

The OECD defines &quot;youth&quot; as &quot;those between 15 and 29 years of age&quot;.

August 12 was declared International Youth Day by the United Nations.

==Youth rights==
Children&#x27;s rights cover all the rights that belong to children. When they grow up, they are granted new rights (like voting, consent, driving, etc.) and duties (criminal response, etc.). There are different minimum limits of age at which youth are not free, independent or legally competent to take some decisions or actions. Some of these limits are: voting age, age of candidacy, age of consent, age of majority, age of criminal responsibility, drinking age, driving age, etc. After youth reach these limits, they are free to vote, have sexual intercourse, buy or consume alcoholic beverages or drive cars, etc.

===Voting age===

Voting age is the minimum age established by law that a person must attain to be eligible to vote in a public election. Typically, the age is set at 18 years; however, ages as low as 16 and as high as 21 exist (see list below). Studies show that 21% of all 18-year-olds have experience with voting. This is an important right since, by voting, they can support politics selected by themselves and not only by people of older generations.

===Age of candidacy===

Age of candidacy is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices. In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be eligible to stand for an election or be granted ballot access.

===Age of consent===

The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender.

=== Defense of infancy ===

The defense of infancy is a form of defense known as an excuse so that defendants falling within the definition of an &quot;infant&quot; are excluded from criminal liability for their actions, if at the relevant time, they had not reached an age of criminal responsibility. This implies that children lack the judgment that comes with age and experience to be held criminally responsible. After reaching the initial age, there may be levels of responsibility dictated by age and the type of offense committed.

=== Drinking age ===

The legal drinking age is the age at which a person can consume or purchase alcoholic beverages. These laws cover a wide range of issues and behaviors, addressing when and where alcohol can be consumed. The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries. These laws vary among different countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances. Most laws apply only to drinking alcohol in public places, with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (an exception being the UK, which has a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places). Some countries also have different age limits for different types of alcoholic drinks.

===Driving age===

Driving age is the age at which a person can apply for a driver&#x27;s license. Countries with the lowest driving ages (below 17) are Argentina, Australia, Canada, El Salvador, Iceland, Israel, Macedonia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, the United Kingdom (Mainland) and the United States. The Canadian province of Alberta and several U.S. states permit youth driving as low as 14. Niger has the highest minimum driving age in the world at 23. In India, driving is legal after getting a license at the age of 18.

===Legal working age===
The legal working age is the minimum age required by law for a person to work in each country or jurisdiction. The threshold of adulthood, or &quot;the age of majority&quot; as recognized or declared in law in most countries, has been set at age 18. Some types of labor are commonly prohibited even for those above the working age, if they have not reached the age of majority. Activities that are dangerous, harmful to the health or that may affect the morals of minors fall into this category.

===Student rights in higher education===

Student rights are those rights, such as civil, constitutional, contractual and consumer rights, which regulate student rights and freedoms and allow students to make use of their educational investment. These include such things as the right to free speech and association, to due process, equality, autonomy, safety and privacy, and accountability in contracts and advertising, which regulate the treatment of students by teachers and administrators.

=== Smoking age ===

The smoking age is the minimum age a person can buy tobacco and/or smoke in public. Most countries regulate this law at the national level while at some point it is done by the state or province.

== School and education ==
Young people spend much of their lives in educational settings, and their experiences in schools, colleges and universities can shape much of their subsequent lives. Research shows that poverty and income affect the likelihood for the incompletion of high school. These factors also increase the likelihood for the youth to not go to a college or university. In the United States, 12.3 percent of young people ages 16 to 24 are disconnected, meaning they are neither in school nor working.

===Health and mortality===

The leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults are due to certain health-risk behaviors. These behaviors are often established during youth and extend into adulthood. Since the risk behaviors in adulthood and youth are interrelated, problems in adulthood are preventable by influencing youth behavior.

A 2004 mortality study of youth (defined in this study as ages 10–24) mortality worldwide found that 97% of deaths occurred in low to middle-income countries, with the majority in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal conditions accounted for 15% of female deaths, while HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis were responsible for 11% of deaths; 14% of male and 5% of female deaths were attributed to traffic accidents, the largest cause overall. Violence accounted for 12% of male deaths. Suicide was the cause of 6% of all deaths.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed its Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) in 2003 to help assess risk behavior. YRBSS monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults. These are behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence;
* tobacco, alcohol and other drug use;
* sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection;
* unhealthy dietary behaviors;
* physical inactivity—plus overweight.

YRBSS includes a national school-based survey conducted by CDC as well as state and local school-based surveys conducted by education and health agencies.

Universal school-based interventions such as formal classroom curricula, behavioural management practices, role‐play, and goal‐setting may be effective in preventing tobacco use, alcohol use, illicit drug use, antisocial behaviour, and improving physical activity of young people.

=== Diabetes ===
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that occurs when pancreatic cells, also called beta cells, are destroyed by the immune system. Beta cells are responsible to produce insulin, which is required by the body to convert blood sugar into energy. Symptoms associated with T1D include frequent urination, increased hunger and thirst, weight loss, blurry vision, and tiredness.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by high blood sugar and insulin resistance. This is not an autoimmune disease and is mostly a result of obesity and lack of exercise. 

Exercise is a crucial addition to a child&#x27;s everyday routine. It can increase the overall psychosocial well-being, metabolic health and cardiovascular benefits. American College of Sports Medicine recommends at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity each day. Recommended activities include running, bicycle riding and team sports. Furthermore, at least 3 days of bone and muscle strengthening activities should be incorporated.

Unfortunately, in reality a large percentage of T1D youth population is not meeting this guideline. Common barriers include fear of hypoglycemia, loss of glucose stability, low fitness levels, insufficient or inadequate knowledge of strategies to prevent hypoglycemia, lack of time, and lack of confidence in the topic of exercise management in type 1 diabetes.

Many Health and Care Professions Council members who work with children aren&#x27;t educated enough about diabetes in children and exercise recommendations. It is important for parents to educate themselves to support their children throughout this chapter of their lives. 

Structured exercises lasting longer than 60 minutes can reduce HbA1c levels and insulin dose per day. Moderate activities can increase cardiorespiratory fitness in children which is crucial for their future health. Cardiorespiratory fitness reduces the risk of other diseases, such as microvascular complications and cardiovascular diseases.

To avoid a possible type 2 diabetes, children are encouraged to keep their BMI and adipose tissue percentage at normal levels. Exercising regularly improves insulin resistance, reduces blood glucose levels, and keep an individual at a healthy weight to stay away from a possible T2D diagnosis.

===Obesity===

Obesity now affects one in five children in the United States, and is the most prevalent nutritional disease of children and adolescents in the United States. Although obesity-associated morbidities occur more frequently in adults, significant consequences of obesity as well as the antecedents of adult disease occur in obese children and adolescents.

Discrimination against overweight children begins early in childhood and becomes progressively institutionalized. Obese children may be taller than their non-overweight peers, in which case they are apt to be viewed as more mature. The inappropriate expectations that result may have an adverse effect on their socialization.

Many of the cardiovascular consequences that characterize adult-onset obesity are preceded by abnormalities that begin in childhood. Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and abnormal glucose tolerance occur with increased frequency in obese children and adolescents. The relationship of cardiovascular risk factors to visceral fat independent of total body fat remains unclear. Sleep apnea, pseudotumor cerebri, and Blount&#x27;s disease represent major sources of morbidity for which rapid and sustained weight reduction is essential. Although several periods of increased risk appear in childhood, it is not clear whether obesity with onset early in childhood carries a greater risk of adult morbidity and mortality.

===Bullying===
Bullying among school-aged youth is increasingly being recognized as an important problem affecting well-being and social functioning. While a certain amount of conflict and harassment is typical of youth peer relations, bullying presents a potentially more serious threat to healthy youth development. The definition of bullying is widely agreed on in literature on bullying.

The majority of research on bullying has been conducted in Europe and Australia. Considerable variability among countries in the prevalence of bullying has been reported. In an international survey of adolescent health-related behaviors, the percentage of students who reported being bullied at least once during the current term ranged from a low of 15% to 20% in some countries to a high of 70% in others. Of particular concern is frequent bullying, typically defined as bullying that occurs once a week or more. The prevalence of frequent bullying reported internationally ranges from a low of 1.9% among one Irish sample to a high of 19% in a Malta study.

Research examining characteristics of youth involved in bullying has consistently found that both bullies and those bullied demonstrate poorer psychosocial functioning than their non-involved peers. Youth who bully others tend to demonstrate higher levels of conduct problems and dislike of school, whereas youth who are bullied generally show higher levels of insecurity, anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhappiness, physical and mental symptoms, and low self-esteem. Males who are bullied also tend to be physically weaker than males in general. The few studies that have examined the characteristics of youth who both bully and are bullied found that these individuals exhibit the poorest psychosocial functioning overall.

===Sexual health and politics===

====General====

Globalization and transnational flows have had tangible effects on sexual relations, identities, and subjectivities. In the wake of an increasingly globalized world order under waning Western dominance, within ideologies of modernity, civilization, and programs for social improvement, discourses on population control, &#x27;safe sex&#x27;, and &#x27;sexual rights&#x27;. Sex education programmes grounded in evidence-based approaches are a cornerstone in reducing adolescent sexual risk behaviours and promoting sexual health. In addition to providing accurate information about consequences of Sexually transmitted disease or STIs and early pregnancy, such programmes build life skills for interpersonal communication and decision making. Such programmes are most commonly implemented in schools, which reach large numbers of teenagers in areas where school enrollment rates are high. However, since not all young people are in school, sex education programmes have also been implemented in clinics, juvenile detention centers and youth-oriented community agencies. Notably, some programmes have been found to reduce risky sexual behaviours when implemented in both school and community settings with only minor modifications to the curricula.

==== Philippines ====
The Sangguniang Kabataan (&quot;Youth Council&quot; in English), commonly known as SK, was a youth council in each barangay (village or district) in the Philippines, before being put &quot;on hold&quot;, but not quite abolished, prior to the 2013 barangay elections. The council represented teenagers from 15 to 17 years old who have resided in their barangay for at least six months and registered to vote. It was the local youth legislature in the village and therefore led the local youth program and projects of the government. The Sangguniang Kabataan was an offshoot of the KB or the &quot;Kabataang Barangay&quot; (Village Youth) which was abolished when the Local Government Code of 1991 was enacted.

==In the Global South==

The vast majority of young people live in developing countries: according to the United Nations, globally around 85 per cent of 15- to 25-year-olds live in developing countries, a figure projected to grow 89.5 per cent by 2025. Moreover, this majority are extremely diverse: some live in rural areas but many inhabit the overcrowded metropolises of India, Mongolia and other parts of Asia and in South America, some live traditional lives in tribal societies, while others participate in global youth culture in ghetto contexts.

Many young lives in developing countries are defined by poverty, some suffer from famine and a lack of clean water, while involvement in armed conflict is all common. Health problems are rife, especially due to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in certain regions. The United Nations estimates that 200 million young people live in poverty, 130 million are illiterate and 10 million live with HIV/AIDS.

<text>Absalom Jones (November 7, 1746February 13, 1818) was an African-American abolitionist and clergyman who became prominent in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Disappointed at the racial discrimination he experienced in a local Methodist church, he founded the Free African Society with Richard Allen in 1787, a mutual aid society for African Americans in the city. The Free African Society included many people newly freed from slavery after the American Revolutionary War.

In 1794, Jones founded the first Black Episcopal congregation, and in 1802, he was the first African American to be ordained as a priest in the Episcopal Church of the United States. He is listed on the Episcopal calendar of saints. He is remembered liturgically on the date of his death, February 13, in the 1979 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; as &quot;Absalom Jones, Priest, 1818&quot;.

==Early life==
Absalom Jones was born into slavery in Sussex County, Delaware, in 1746. When he was sixteen, his enslaver sold him, his mother, and his siblings to a neighboring farmer. That year, the farmer kept Absalom but sold his mother and siblings and moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he became a merchant. Absalom was allowed to attend Benezet&#x27;s School, where he learned to read and write. While still enslaved by Mr. Wynkop (who was a vestryman of Christ Church and later St. Peter&#x27;s), Absalom married Mary King (an enslaved woman owned by S. King, a neighbor to the Wynkoops), on January 4, 1770. the Rev. Jacob Duché performed the wedding ceremony.

By 1778, Absalom had purchased his wife&#x27;s freedom so their children would be free; he asked for aid by donations and loans. (According to colonial law, children took the status of their mother, so children born to enslaved women were enslaved from birth.) Absalom also wrote to his enslaver seeking his freedom but was initially denied. In 1784, however, Wynkoop manumitted him, inspired by revolutionary ideals. Absalom took the surname &quot;Jones&quot; as an indication of his American identity.

Later, Jones applied for his freedom for the second time. He was released from slavery on October 1, 1784. After being released from slavery, Absalom was ordained as a priest in September 1802. This made him the first Black person to be ordained in America by a well-known religion.

==Methodist Church==
Around 1780, a Methodist movement was sweeping through the colonies as part of the Second Great Awakening. It came at a time of revolutionary ferment in the closing period of the American Revolutionary War. The movement was especially popular in New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. Methodists had developed in Great Britain as evangelicals within the Church of England. In December 1784, Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury established the Methodist Episcopal Church as a new denomination, separate from the Church of England.

==Ministerial career==
Pennsylvania abolished slavery and became a free state in the new United States. Jones became a lay minister of the interracial congregation of St. George&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. The Methodist church admitted persons of all races and allowed African Americans to preach. Together with Richard Allen, Jones was one of the first African Americans licensed to preach by the Methodist Episcopal Church.

However, members of the church still practiced racial discrimination. In 1792, while at St. George&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church, Absalom Jones and other African American members were told that they could not join the rest of the congregation in seating and kneeling on the first floor and instead had to be segregated first sitting against the wall and then in the gallery or balcony. After their prayer, Jones and most of the church&#x27;s African-American members got up and walked out.

Jones and Allen founded the Free African Society (FAS), first conceived as a non-denominational mutual aid society, to help newly freed people in Philadelphia. Jones and Allen later separated, as their religious lives took different directions after 1794. They remained lifelong friends and collaborators.

As 1791 began, Jones started holding religious services at FAS, which became the core of his African Church in Philadelphia the following year. Jones wanted to establish an African-American congregation independent of Caucasian control while remaining part of the Episcopal Church. After a successful petition, the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas, the first Black church in Philadelphia, opened its doors on July 17, 1794. Jones was ordained as a deacon in 1795 and as a priest in 1802, became the first African-American priest in the Episcopal Church.

A month after St. Thomas church opened, the Founders and Trustees published &quot;The Causes and Motives for Establishing St. Thomas&#x27;s African Church of Philadelphia,&quot; saying their intent was &quot;to arise out of the dust and shake ourselves, and throw off that servile fear, that the habit of oppression and bondage trained us up in.&quot;

Famous for his oratory, Jones helped establish the tradition of anti-slavery sermons on New Year&#x27;s Day. His sermon for January 1, 1808, the date on which the U.S. Constitution mandated the end of the African slave trade, was called &quot;A Thanksgiving Sermon&quot; and published in pamphlet form. It became famous. Rumors persisted that Jones had supernatural abilities to influence the minds of assembled congregations. Caucasian observers failed to recognize his oratory skills, perhaps because they believed rhetoric to be beyond the capabilities of people of African descent. Numerous other African-American leaders were similarly said to have supernatural abilities.

==Fugitive Slave Act of 1793==
In 1775, the state of North Carolina had made it illegal to free enslaved people unless approved by a county court, a provision largely ignored by members of the Society of Friends (Quakers). They not only continued to free the people they enslaved but, in some cases, bought enslaved people from other men to free them. In 1788, the North Carolina legislature passed a law allowing the capture and sale of any formerly enslaved person freed without court approval, with twenty percent of the sale price going as a reward to the person who reported the illegal manumission. Many freed African Americans fled the state to avoid being captured and sold back into slavery.

After becoming the first Black and freedman to be ordained as a priest, and as the Constitution&#x27;s deadline for abolition of the slave trade passed, Jones took part in the first group of African Americans to petition the U.S. Congress. Their petition related to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, which they criticized for encouraging cruelty and brutality, as well as supporting the continuing criminal practice of kidnapping free Blacks and selling them into slavery. Jones drafted a petition on behalf of four formerly enslaved people and asked Congress to adopt &quot;some remedy for an evil of such magnitude.&quot;

The petition was presented on 30 January 1797 by U.S. Representative John Swanwick of Pennsylvania. Jones used moral suasion: trying to convince whites that slavery was immoral, offensive to God, and contrary to the nation&#x27;s ideal. Although U.S. Representative George Thatcher of Massachusetts argued that the petition should be accepted and referred to the Committee on the Fugitive Law, the House of Representatives declined to accept the petition by a vote of 50 to 33. Jones submitted a similar petition two years later, which was also declined.

==African Methodist Episcopal Church==

On a parallel path, Richard Allen (1760–1831) founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the first independent Black church within the Methodist tradition. He and his followers converted a building and opened it on July 29, 1794, as Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church. In 1799, Allen was ordained as the first Black minister in the Methodist Church by Bishop Francis Asbury. In 1816, Allen gathered other Black congregations in the region to create a new and fully independent denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1816, Allen was elected as the AME&#x27;s first bishop.

==Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 ==

Yellow fever repeatedly struck Philadelphia and other coastal cities in the 1790s, until sanitary improvements advocated by Dr. Benjamin Rush were adopted and completed. In the meantime, Allen and Jones assisted Rush in helping people afflicted by the plague, for people of African descent were initially rumored to be immune. Many Caucasians (including most doctors except for Rush and his assistants, some of whom died) fled the city, hoping to escape infection. Allen and Jones&#x27; corps of African-American Philadelphians helped nurse the sick, as well as bury the dead. Jones, in particular, sometimes worked through the night. However, Rush&#x27;s reliance on bleeding and purging as a medical treatment proved misplaced.

When Mathew Carey published a popular pamphlet accusing African Americans of profiting from nursing sick Caucasian citizens, Jones and Allen published a protest pamphlet in response. They described sacrifices that they and the Free African Society members made for the city&#x27;s health. Philadelphia Mayor Matthew Clarkson, who had called upon them for help, publicly recognized that Jones and Allen acted upon their desires to improve the entire community. Jones&#x27; responses to the overall crisis strengthened ties between &#x27;free&#x27; African Americans and many progressive European Americans, aiding him later on when he established St. Thomas&#x27; Episcopal Church. Almost twenty times more black people helped the plague-struck than whites, which proved crucial in helping St. Thomas Church gain social acceptance.

==Death and legacy==

Jones died on February 13, 1818, in Philadelphia. He was initially interred in the St. Thomas Churchyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His body was relocated to Lebanon Cemetery and then to Eden Cemetery. In 1991, his remains were exhumed, cremated and placed in a reliquary in the Absalom Jones altar of the current African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas (now located at 6361 Lancaster Avenue in Philadelphia). The chapel is named in his honor, as is the church&#x27;s rectory.

The national Episcopal Church remembers his life and service annually with a Lesser Feast on the anniversary of his death, February 13.

The Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania honors his memory with an annual celebration and award.

<text>Cameron Balloons is a company established in 1971 in Bristol, England, by Don Cameron to manufacture hot air balloons. Cameron had previously, with others, constructed ten hot air balloons under the name Omega. Production was in the basement of his house, moving in 1972 to an old church in the city. In 1983 Cameron Balloons moved into its current premises in the former Robinsons paper bag/printing factory (built in 1887 in the Bedminster area of the city). In 1989 the company received the Queen&#x27;s Award for Export.

Output has grown to around 110 balloons per year. , Cameron Balloons accounted for 1,073 of the 1,553 hot air balloons registered with the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority.
Cameron Balloons is also famous for its special shapes, the first being Robertson&#x27;s Golly, constructed in 1975. Most special shapes are made for commercial advertising, but some have been bought privately. Notable amongst these private buyers is the late Malcolm Forbes of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, who commissioned a number of special shapes, including Harley-Davidson motorbike, Sphinx, bust of Beethoven, French Chateau, Pagoda and Minaret. The company also produced the BBC Globe balloon, made popular by the BBC One &#x27;Balloon&#x27; idents. More recently the company has manufactured special shapes for KAWS and Patricia Piccinini.

==Expansion via acquisitions==

During the 1990s, the company strengthened its position, via a string of acquisitions. First, Cameron acquired its main British competitor Thunder &amp; Colt Balloons. Then, it bought the smaller Sky Balloons, which had been formed by former Thunder &amp; Colt employees after the company&#x27;s sale. Finally, Cameron acquired two-thirds ownership of Lindstrand Balloons, which had been formed by Per Lindstrand after he left Thunder &amp; Colt in the early 1990s.

<doc id="379489" wikidata="Q842091" url="?curid=379489" title="Duchy of Normandy">
<text>The Duchy of Normandy grew out of the 911 Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the Viking leader Rollo. The duchy was named for its inhabitants, the Normans.

From 1066 until 1204, as a result of the Norman Conquest of England, the dukes of Normandy were usually also kings of England, the only exceptions being Dukes Robert Curthose (1087–1106), Geoffrey Plantagenet (1144–1150), and Henry II (1150–1152), who became king of England in 1154.

In 1202, Philip II of France declared Normandy forfeit to him and seized it by force of arms in 1204. It remained disputed territory until the Treaty of Paris of 1259, when the English sovereign ceded his claim except for the Channel Islands; i.e., the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey, and their dependencies (including Sark).

In the Kingdom of France, the duchy was occasionally set apart as an appanage to be ruled by a member of the royal family. After 1469, however, it was permanently united to the royal domain, although the title was occasionally conferred as an honorific upon junior members of the royal family. The last French duke of Normandy in this sense was Louis-Charles, duke from 1785 to 1792.

The title &quot;Duke of Normandy&quot; continues to be used in an informal manner in the Channel Islands, to refer to the monarch of the United Kingdom. There is no definite end as to when the Duchy of Normandy (with its remnants in the Channel Islands) as a vassal of the English monarch became &#x27;part&#x27; of the United Kingdom, with history blending the link between the two gradually. In official documents in Guernsey, the British monarch is entitled &quot;Duke of Normandy&quot;, while in official documents in Jersey, the British monarch is ambiguously titled Sovereign.

In 1204, Normandy was transferred from England to France, with the exception of the Channel Islands, which were never incorporated into England. As such, although no form of the Duchy or its structure exists, there has never been a formal end to Norman state rule over the islands.

==History==
===Origins===
The first Viking attack up the Seine river took place in 820. By 911, the area had been raided many times and there were even small Viking settlements on the lower Seine. The text of the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte has not survived. It is only known through the historian Dudo of Saint-Quentin, who was writing a century after the event. The exact date of the treaty is unknown, but it was likely in the autumn of 911. By the agreement, Charles III, king of the West Franks, granted to the Viking leader Rollo some lands along the lower Seine that were apparently already under Danish control. Whether Rollo himself was a Dane or a Norwegian is not known. For his part, Rollo agreed to defend the territory from other Vikings and that he and his men would convert to Christianity. Rollo&#x27;s decision to convert and come to terms with the Franks came in the aftermath of his defeat at the battle of Chartres by Richard of Burgundy and Robert of Neustria (the future Robert I of France) earlier in 911.

The territory ceded to Rollo comprised the &quot;pagi&quot; of the Caux, Évrecin, Roumois and Talou. This was territory formerly known as the county of Rouen, and which would become Upper Normandy. A royal diploma of 918 confirms the donation of 911, using the verb &quot;adnuo&quot; (&quot;I grant&quot;). There is no evidence that Rollo owed any service or oath to the king for his lands, nor that there were any legal means for the king to take them back: they were granted outright. Likewise, Rollo does not seem to have been created a count or given comital authority, but later sagas refer to him as &quot;Rúðujarl&quot; (earl of Rouen).

The Norman polity had to contend with the Frankish and Breton systems of power that already existed in Normandy. In the early 10th century, Normandy was not a political or monetary unit. According to many academics, &quot;the formation of a new aristocracy, monastic reform, episcopal revival, written bureaucracy, saints’ cults – with necessarily different timelines&quot; were as important if not more than the ducal narrative espoused by Dudo. The formation of the Norman state also coincided with the creation of an origin myth for the Norman ducal family through Dudo, such as Rollo being compared to a &quot;good pagan&quot; like the Trojan hero Aeneas. Through this narrative, the Normans were assimilated closer to the Frankish core as they moved away from their pagan Scandinavian origins.

===Norse settlement===
There were two distinct patterns of Norse settlement in the duchy. In the Danish area in the Roumois and the Caux, settlers intermingled with the indigenous Gallo-Romance-speaking population. Rollo shared out the large estates with his companions and gave agricultural land to his other followers. Danish settlers cleared their own land to farm it, and there was no segregation of populations.

In the northern Cotentin on the other hand, the population was purely Norwegian. Coastal features bore Norse names as did the three &quot;pagi&quot; of Haga, Sarnes and Helganes (as late as 1027). The Norwegians may even have set up a &quot;þing&quot;, an assembly of all free men, whose meeting place may be preserved in the name of Le Tingland.

Within a few generations of the founding of Normandy in 911, however, the Scandinavian settlers had intermarried with the natives and adopted much of their culture. But in 911, Normandy was not a political nor monetary unit. Frankish culture remained dominant and according to some scholars, 10th century Normandy was characterized by a diverse Scandinavian population interacting with the &quot;local Frankish matrix&quot; that existed in the region. In the end, the Normans stressed assimilation with the local population. In the 11th century, the anonymous author of the &quot;Miracles of Saint Wulfram&quot; referred to the formation of a Norman identity as &quot;shaping [of] all races into one single people&quot;.

According to some historians, the idea of &quot;Norman&quot; as a political identity was a deliberate creation of the court of Richard I in the 960s as a way to &quot;create a powerful if rather incoherent sense of group solidarity to galvanize the duchy&#x27;s disparate elites around the duke&quot;.

===Norman rule===
Starting with Rollo, Normandy was ruled by an enduring and long-lived Viking dynasty. Illegitimacy was not a bar to succession and three of the first six rulers of Normandy were illegitimate sons of concubines. Rollo&#x27;s successor, William Longsword, managed in expanding his domain and came into conflict with Arnulf of Flanders, who had him assassinated in 942. This led to a crisis in Normandy, with a minor succeeding as Richard I, and also led to a temporary revival of Norse paganism in Normandy. Richard I&#x27;s son, Richard II, was the first to be styled &quot;duke&quot; of Normandy, the ducal title becoming established between 987 and 1006.

In 924, King Radulf extended Rollo&#x27;s county westward up to the river Vire, including the Bessin, where some Danes from England had settled not long before. In 933, King Radulf granted the Avranchin and Cotentin to Rollo&#x27;s son and successor, William Longsword. These areas had been previously under Breton rule. The northern Cotentin had been settled by Norwegians coming from the region of the Irish Sea. There was initially much hostility between these Norwegian settlers and their new Danish overlords. These expansions brought the boundaries of Normandy roughly in line with those of the ecclesiastical province of Rouen.

The Norman dukes created the most powerful, consolidated duchy in Western Europe between the years 980, when the dukes helped place Hugh Capet on the French throne, and 1050. Scholarly churchmen were brought into Normandy from the Rhineland, and they built and endowed monasteries and supported monastic schools, thus helping to integrate distant territories into a wider framework. The dukes imposed heavy feudal burdens on the ecclesiastical fiefs, which supplied the armed knights that enabled the dukes to control the restive lay lords but whose bastards could not inherit. By the mid-11th century the Duke of Normandy could count on more than 300 armed and mounted knights from his ecclesiastical vassals alone. By the 1020s the dukes were able to impose vassalage on the lay nobility as well. Until Richard II, the Norman rulers did not hesitate to call Viking mercenaries for help to get rid of their enemies around Normandy, such as the king of the Franks himself. Olaf Haraldsson crossed the Channel in such circumstances to support Richard II in the conflict against the count of Chartres and was baptized in Rouen in 1014.

In 1066, Duke William defeated Harold II of England at the Battle of Hastings and was subsequently crowned King of England, through the Norman conquest of England. Anglo-Norman and French relations became complicated after the Norman Conquest. The Norman dukes retained control of their holdings in Normandy as vassals owing fealty to the King of France, but they were his equals as kings of England. Serfdom was outlawed around 1100.

From 1154 until 1214, with the creation of the Angevin Empire, the Angevin kings of England controlled half of France and all of England, dwarfing the power of the French king, yet the Angevins were still &quot;de jure&quot; French vassals.

The Duchy remained part of the Angevin Empire until 1204, when Philip II of France conquered the continental lands of the Duchy, which became part of the royal domain. The English sovereigns continued to claim them until the Treaty of Paris (1259) but in fact kept only the Channel Islands. Having little confidence in the loyalty of the Normans, Philip installed French administrators and built a powerful fortress, the Château de Rouen, as a symbol of royal power.

===French appanage===

Although within the royal demesne, Normandy retained some specificity. Norman law continued to serve as the basis for court decisions. In 1315, faced with the constant encroachments of royal power on the liberties of Normandy, the barons and towns pressed the Norman Charter on the king. This document did not provide autonomy to the province but protected it against arbitrary royal acts. The judgments of the Exchequer, the main court of Normandy, were declared final. This meant that Paris could not reverse a judgment of Rouen. Another important concession was that the King of France could not raise a new tax without the consent of the Normans. However the charter, granted at a time when royal authority was faltering, was violated several times thereafter when the monarchy had regained its power.

The Duchy of Normandy survived mainly by the intermittent installation of a duke. In practice, the King of France sometimes gave that portion of his kingdom to a close member of his family, who then did homage to the king. Philip VI made Jean, his eldest son and heir to his throne, the Duke of Normandy. In turn, Jean II appointed his heir, Charles.

In 1465, Louis XI was forced by the League of the Public Weal to cede the duchy to his eighteen-year-old brother, Charles de Valois. This concession was a problem for the king since Charles was the puppet of the king&#x27;s enemies. Normandy could thus serve as a basis for rebellion against the royal power. In 1469, therefore, Louis XI convinced his brother under duress to exchange Normandy for the Duchy of Guyenne (Aquitaine). Finally, at the request of the cowed Estates of Normandy and to signify that the duchy would not be ceded again, at a session of the Norman Exchequer on 9 November 1469 the ducal ring was placed on an anvil and smashed. Philippe de Commynes expressed what was probably a common Norman thought of the time: &quot;It has always seemed good to the Normans and still does that their great duchy really should require a duke&quot; (&quot;A tousjours bien semblé aux Normands et faict encores que si grand duchié comme la leur requiert bien un duc&quot;).

Dauphin Louis Charles, the second son of Louis XVI, was again given the nominal title of &#x27;Duke of Normandy&#x27; before the death of his elder brother in 1789.

===Modern usage===
In the Channel Islands, the British monarch is known informally as the &quot;Duke of Normandy&quot;, irrespective of whether or not the holder is male (as in the case of Queen Elizabeth II who was known by this title). The Channel Islands are the last remaining part of the former Duchy of Normandy to remain under the rule of the British monarch. Although the English monarchy relinquished claims to continental Normandy and other French claims in 1259 (in the Treaty of Paris), the Channel Islands (except for Chausey under French sovereignty) remain Crown dependencies of the British throne.

In the islanders&#x27; loyal toast, they say, &quot;The Duke of Normandy, our King&quot;, or &quot;The King, our Duke&quot;, &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Rouai, nouotre Duc&quot; or &quot;L&#x27;Roué, note Du&quot; in Norman (Jèrriais and Guernésiais respectively), or &quot;Le Roi, notre Duc&quot;&quot; in Standard French, rather than simply &quot;The King&quot;, as is the practice in the United Kingdom.
The title &#x27;Duke of Normandy&#x27; is not used in formal government publications, and, as a matter of Channel Islands law, does not exist.

The British historian Ben Pimlott noted that while Queen Elizabeth II was on a visit to mainland Normandy in May 1967, French locals began to doff their hats and shout , to which the Queen supposedly replied &quot;Well, I &quot;am&quot; the Duke of Normandy!&quot;

* 17 September 1775 – 1 January 1791: François Henri, Duke of Harcourt

==Law==

There are traces of Scandinavian law in the customary laws of Normandy, which were first written down in the 13th century. A charter of 1050, listing several pleas before Duke William II, refers to the penalty of banishment as &quot;ullac&quot; (from Old Norse &quot;útlagr&quot;). The word was still current in the 12th century, when it was used in the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot;. Marriage &quot;more danico&quot; (&quot;in the Danish manner&quot;), that is, without any ecclesiastical ceremony in accordance with old Norse custom, was recognised as legal in Normandy and in the Norman church. The first three dukes of Normandy all practised it.

Scandinavian influence is especially apparent in laws relating to waters. The duke possessed the &quot;droit de varech&quot; (from Old Danish &quot;vrek&quot;), the right to all shipwrecks. He also had a monopoly on whale and sturgeon. A similar monopoly belonged to the Danish king in the Jutlandic law of 1241. Remarkably, whale (including dolphins) and sturgeon still belong to the monarch in the United Kingdom in the twenty-first century, as royal fish. The Norman Latin terms for whalers (&quot;valmanni&quot;, from &quot;hvalmenn&quot;) and whaling station (&quot;valseta&quot;, from &quot;hvalmannasetr&quot;) both derive from Old Norse. Likewise, fishing in Normandy seems to have come under Scandinavian rules. A charter of 1030 uses the term &quot;fisigardum&quot; (from Old Norse &quot;fiskigarðr&quot;) for &quot;fisheries&quot;, a term also found in the Scanian law of &quot;c&quot;. 1210.

There is no surviving reference to the &quot;hirð&quot; or the &quot;leiðangr&quot; in Normandy, but the latter probably existed. The surname Huscaille, first attested in 1263, probably derives from &quot;húskarl&quot;, but is late evidence for the existence of a &quot;hirð&quot; in the 10th century.

<doc id="379495" wikidata="Q17060061" url="?curid=379495" title="Young Offenders Act">
<text>The Young Offenders Act (YOA; ) was an act of the Parliament of Canada, granted Royal Assent in 1982 and proclaimed in force on April 2, 1984, that regulated the criminal prosecution of Canadian youths.

The act was repealed in 2003 with the passing of the &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot;.

== Overview ==
The &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot; replaced the earlier &quot;Juvenile Delinquents Act&quot; enacted in 1908.

The &quot;Act&quot; established the national age of criminal responsibility at 12 years old, and said that youths can be prosecuted only if they break a law of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; (previously, youths could be prosecuted or punished solely on the grounds that it was in the youth&#x27;s best interests)..

The &quot;Act&quot; also indicated that the rights established in the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; apply to youths as well.

Controversy dogged the act for many years. Many felt that the &quot;Act&quot;&#x27;s limit on a three-year detention sentence for youths was overly lax, and allowed youths to get unreasonably light sentences for murder or sexual assault. This maximum was repeatedly increased until in 1996 it was extended to a maximum of ten years. That same year, a provision was also made to allow 16-year-olds to be tried as adults in certain cases. Critics contended that this was too harsh, as it made youths possible victims of life sentences.

The &quot;Act&quot; also drew much criticism from the public for not charging young offenders under the age of 12 years, and for banning publication of the identities of youths who commit criminal acts, contending that the number of violent crimes committed by youths has dramatically increased, as has the number of repeat young offenders, since the act was passed. The demands by the Canadian public for changes for the better in dealing with youth crime, particularly in the wake of the beating and attempted murder in 1999 of then-15-year-old Jonathan Wambach in Newmarket, Ontario, by a gang of teenagers, led to the introduction of the &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot; to replace the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot; in 2003.

<doc id="379497" wikidata="Q1112675" url="?curid=379497" title="Columbine High School">
<text>Columbine High School (CHS) is a public high school in Columbine, Colorado, United States, in the Denver metropolitan area. It is part of the Jefferson County Public Schools district.

In 1999, it became the scene of an infamous mass shooting, where 12 students and one teacher were murdered by senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold before the pair committed suicide.

== History ==
Columbine High School opened in 1973 with a capacity for 1,652 students. It was named after the surrounding community of Columbine, which in turn was named after the state flower of Colorado: the columbine. The school&#x27;s first principal was Gerald Difford. There was no senior class during the school&#x27;s first year; its first graduating class was in 1975. The school colors were selected through a vote by students at Ken Caryl Junior High School and Bear Creek High School, who were the first to attend Columbine High School when it opened in 1973.

The school has undergone significant renovations since it first opened: in 1995, with the addition of a new cafeteria and library; in 1999–2000, with interior renovations to the corridors, cafeteria, and former library; and in the early 2000s, with the addition of the new HOPE Columbine Memorial Library and a memorial on the site.

=== Massacre ===

Columbine High School was the site of one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history. The shootings occurred on April 20, 1999, when senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold opened fire and killed 12 students and a teacher, and wounded 24 others, 21 of them by gunfire, before they both committed suicide in the library. The massacre made headlines both nationally and internationally, making Columbine a household name, and causing a moral panic in U.S. high schools. It was the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history until it was surpassed by the Parkland high school shooting on February 14, 2018, in which 17 people were killed.

After the shooting, classes at Columbine were held at nearby Chatfield Senior High for the remaining three weeks of that school year.

The school went through a major renovation in 1995, just four years before the massacre, adding a new library and cafeteria. After the shootings, Columbine completely demolished its library, located above the cafeteria, since it was the site where the majority of the deaths occurred. The site was then turned into a memorial ceiling and atrium; a new, larger library was built on the hill where the shooting began and dedicated to the memory of the victims.

By 2019, the school remained a &quot;macabre tourist attraction&quot; for those fascinated by the massacre, with hundreds stopped annually caught trespassing on the grounds or trying to enter the buildings. In June 2019, the superintendent of Jefferson County Public Schools proposed tearing down the school and rebuilding it more securely to lessen its &quot;morbid fascination&quot;.

===2019 Shooting threat===

On April 15, 2019, 18-year old Sol Pais bought three one-way tickets from Miami International Airport to Denver, Colorado. After arriving in Colorado, Pais bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition from a dealer she had previously been in contact with.

On April 16, the captain of the Miami Beach Police Department alerted agents with the FBI field office in Miami about a &quot;potential school shooter who is infatuated with Columbine shooter Eric Harris&quot;. Shortly after Pais was reported missing, investigators gained access to Pais&#x27; email, which revealed information for the gun sellers Pais had contacted in Florida. The FBI contacted Pais&#x27; Uber driver, who described Pais as cheerful and fluent in Spanish, and had &quot;travelled to Colorado for recreation and was excited to see snow&quot;.

At this point, the FBI decided to alert the public due to the danger of a copycat 20th anniversary shooting around April 20 at or near Columbine High School, although April 20 that year was a Saturday. After the manhunt became public, it quickly made national headlines, and hundreds of people called the FBI claiming they had seen Pais panhandling, buying a gun or actually outside of Columbine High School. Columbine High School went on lockdown on the afternoon of April 16, and was dismissed normally at the end of the day. With the FBI finding no trace of Pais by the end of the day, Columbine and several dozen schools closed for the day, keeping more than 500,000 students across the state home.

According to Pais&#x27; autopsy, however, Pais was already deceased before the manhunt even started on April 15. She had taken about a 40-minute Uber drive from DIA to a mall, and then purchased a shotgun and ammunition from the dealer she had been in contact with previously, before taking another Uber ride from the gun shop &quot;into the mountains&quot; near Mount Evans. According to this Uber driver, Pais &quot;had no food or water and only minimal clothing,&quot; and had a &quot;green rifle case&quot; with a &quot;bird hunting gun&quot;. Pais apparently committed suicide by gunshot to the head later that night.

<doc id="379500" wikidata="Q2719356" url="?curid=379500" title="Piano Quintet (Brahms)">
<text>The Piano Quintet in [[F minor]], Op. 34, by Johannes Brahms was completed during the summer of 1864 and published in 1865. It was dedicated to Her Royal Highness Princess Anna of Hesse. As with most piano quintets composed after Robert Schumann&#x27;s Piano Quintet (1842), it is written for piano and string quartet (two violins, viola and cello).

The work, &quot;often called the crown of his chamber music,&quot; began life as a string quintet (completed in 1862 and scored for two violins, viola, and two cellos). Brahms transcribed the quintet into a sonata for two pianos (in which form Brahms and Carl Tausig performed it) before giving it its final form. Brahms destroyed the original version for string quintet, but published the Sonata as Op. 34b. As a piano quintet, it was given its premiere in Paris some two weeks before Good Friday in 1868.

The outer movements are more adventurous than usual in terms of harmony and are unsettling in effect. The introduction to the finale, with its rising figure in semitones, is especially remarkable. Piano and strings play an equally important role throughout this work, which Swafford notes for its &quot;unity of expression&quot; and a consistently dark mood: &quot;at times anguished, at times (in the scherzo) demonic, at times tragic.&quot;

==Structure==

The piece is in four movements:
===First movement===
This movement begins with a unison theme in all instruments. It is in sonata form with the exposition concluding in the major-mode submediant (D), which is approached through a second subject in its enharmonic parallel minor (C). The first theme&#x27;s heavy emphasis on D prepares and smooths out this modulation, as well as its reversal with the approach to the expositional repeat. It is notable that Brahms&#x27; other F minor sonata-form first movements – from the Sonata Op. 5 and the Clarinet Sonata Op. 120/1 – also have an expositional goal of D major, and both also are followed by a slow movement in A major.

In the recapitulation, the bridge and first half of the second theme are transposed by a fifth, with the latter beginning in F minor, before the tonic key is restored halfway through. A peaceful post-recapitulory coda in F major is cut short by a return to the stormy first theme.

===Second movement===
This calm movement is in A major, with a second theme in E major – enharmonically a major third lower, as in the first movement.

===Third movement===

This movement is in ternary form (ABA) with A being a scherzo in C minor (with a secondary theme in C major and E major) and B being a trio in C major.

This movement shows the influence of Franz Schubert&#x27;s String Quintet. Like Schubert&#x27;s masterpiece, this movement is also in C minor/major, and ends in the same manner as Schubert&#x27;s finale, with strong emphasis on the flat supertonic D, before the final tonic C.

===Fourth movement===

The last movement &quot;begins slowly and gropingly,&quot; with &quot;the most melancholy moments in the entire work.&quot; An introduction begins this movement, which is harmonically reminiscent of Beethoven&#x27;s late string quartets. After a cadence on the dominant C, the cello introduces the first theme of the sonata-allegro, which owes its simplicity to Brahms&#x27;s interest in Hungarian folk music and also resembles the opening of the finale of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Grand Duo&quot; for piano four-hands. A vociferous, stormy bridge connects the first theme to the second theme, which is in the minor-mode dominant key (C). The expositional closing theme, a jerky version of the first theme, leads into the recapitulation, which involves a developmental episode that emphasises the parallel major. The end of the recapitulation leads into a grave, quiet section in the initial tempo of the introduction, but it is arguably a simple reworking of the expositional closing theme (albeit in F minor). This short section modulates to C minor, which, if it pertains to D major of the first movement (as it is the parallel minor), may symbolize the musical odyssey of the entire piece. The tempo is presto for this greatly extended coda in F minor, which develops a new theme as well as the second theme of the sonata allegro section, and ultimately culminates in an unrelenting outburst of fiery passion, providing an intense conclusion for the entire piece.

==Arrangements==
Composer Robin Holloway arranged the Brahms Piano Quintet for full orchestra in 2008. A live 2014 performance can be heard on the NPK Radio website. A cd recording was made in 2023 by Paul Mann conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra on the Toccata Classics label. The arrangement was called &quot;Symphony in F, Op. 34&quot;.

Composer Nick Norton has also arranged the piece for piano and orchestra.

<doc id="379507" wikidata="Q6670851" url="?curid=379507" title="Synchrotron light source">
<text>A synchrotron light source is a source of electromagnetic radiation (EM) usually produced by a storage ring, for scientific and technical purposes. First observed in synchrotrons, synchrotron light is now produced by storage rings and other specialized particle accelerators, typically accelerating electrons. Once the high-energy electron beam has been generated, it is directed into auxiliary components such as bending magnets and insertion devices (undulators or wigglers) in storage rings and free electron lasers. 
These supply the strong magnetic fields perpendicular to the beam that are needed to stimulate the high energy electrons to emit photons.

The major applications of synchrotron light are in condensed matter physics, materials science, biology and medicine. A large fraction of experiments using synchrotron light involve probing the structure of matter from the sub-nanometer level of electronic structure to the micrometer and millimeter levels important in medical imaging. An example of a practical industrial application is the manufacturing of microstructures by the LIGA process.

Synchrotron is one of the most expensive kinds of light source known, but it is practically the only viable luminous source of wide-band radiation in far infrared wavelength range for some applications, such as far-infrared absorption spectrometry.

== Spectral brightness ==

The primary figure of merit used to compare different sources of synchrotron radiation has been referred to as the &quot;brightness&quot;, the &quot;brilliance&quot;, and the &quot;spectral brightness&quot;, with the latter term being recommended as the best choice by the Working Group on Synchrotron Nomenclature. Regardless of the name chosen, the term is a measure of the total flux of photons in a given six-dimensional phase space per unit bandwidth (BW).

The spectral brightness is given by

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the number of photons per second in the beam, formula_3 and formula_4 are the root mean square values for the size of the beam in the axes perpendicular to the beam direction, formula_5 and formula_6 are the RMS values for the beam solid angle in the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; dimensions, and formula_7 is the relative bandwidth, or spread in beam frequency around the central frequency. The customary value for bandwidth is 0.1%.

Spectral brightness has units of time−1⋅distance−2⋅angle−2⋅(% bandwidth)−1.

==Properties of sources==

Especially when artificially produced, synchrotron radiation is notable for its:
* High brilliance, many orders of magnitude more than with X-rays produced in conventional X-ray tubes: 3rd-generation sources typically have a brilliance larger than 1018 photons·s−1·mm−2·mrad−2/(0.1%BW), where 0.1%BW denotes a bandwidth 10−3&quot;ω&quot; centered around the frequency &quot;ω&quot;.
* High level of polarization (linear, elliptical or circular).
* High collimation, i.e. small angular divergence of the beam.
* Low emittance, i.e. the product of source cross-section and solid angle of emission is small.
* Wide tunability in energy/wavelength by monochromatization (sub-electronvolt up to the megaelectronvolt range).
* Pulsed light emission (pulse durations at or below one nanosecond, or a billionth of a second)..

==Synchrotron radiation from accelerators==
Synchrotron radiation may occur in accelerators either as a nuisance, causing undesired energy loss in particle physics contexts, or as a deliberately produced radiation source for numerous laboratory applications. Electrons are accelerated to high speeds in several stages to achieve a final energy that is typically in the gigaelectronvolt range. The electrons are forced to travel in a closed path by strong magnetic fields. This is similar to a radio antenna, but with the difference that the relativistic speed changes the observed frequency due to the Doppler effect by a factor formula_8. Relativistic Lorentz contraction bumps the frequency by another factor of formula_8, thus multiplying the gigahertz frequency of the resonant cavity that accelerates the electrons into the X-ray range. Another dramatic effect of relativity is that the radiation pattern is distorted from the isotropic dipole pattern expected from non-relativistic theory into an extremely forward-pointing cone of radiation. This makes synchrotron radiation sources the most brilliant known sources of X-rays. The planar acceleration geometry makes the radiation linearly polarized when observed in the orbital plane, and circularly polarized when observed at a small angle to that plane.

The advantages of using synchrotron radiation for spectroscopy and diffraction have been realized by an ever-growing scientific community, beginning in the 1960s and 1970s. In the beginning, accelerators were built for particle physics, and synchrotron radiation was used in &quot;parasitic mode&quot; when bending magnet radiation had to be extracted by drilling extra holes in the beam pipes. The first storage ring commissioned as a synchrotron light source was Tantalus, at the Synchrotron Radiation Center, first operational in 1968. As accelerator synchrotron radiation became more intense and its applications more promising, devices that enhanced the intensity of synchrotron radiation were built into existing rings. Third-generation synchrotron radiation sources were conceived and optimized from the outset to produce brilliant X-rays. Fourth-generation sources that will include different concepts for producing ultrabrilliant, pulsed time-structured X-rays for extremely demanding and also probably yet-to-be-conceived experiments are under consideration.

Bending electromagnets in accelerators were first used to generate this radiation, but to generate stronger radiation, other specialized devices – insertion devices – are sometimes employed. Current (third-generation) synchrotron radiation sources are typically reliant upon these insertion devices, where straight sections of the storage ring incorporate periodic magnetic structures (comprising many magnets in a pattern of alternating N and S poles – see diagram above) which force the electrons into a sinusoidal or helical path. Thus, instead of a single bend, many tens or hundreds of &quot;wiggles&quot; at precisely calculated positions add up or multiply the total intensity of the beam.

These devices are called wigglers or undulators. The main difference between an undulator and a wiggler is the intensity of their magnetic field and the amplitude of the deviation from the straight line path of the electrons.

There are openings in the storage ring to let the radiation exit and follow a beam line into the experimenters&#x27; vacuum chamber. A great number of such beamlines can emerge from modern third-generation synchrotron radiation sources.

===Storage rings===
The electrons may be extracted from the accelerator proper and stored in an ultrahigh vacuum auxiliary magnetic storage ring where they may circle a large number of times. The magnets in the ring also need to repeatedly recompress the beam against Coulomb (space charge) forces tending to disrupt the electron bunches. The change of direction is a form of acceleration and thus the electrons emit radiation at GeV energies.

==Applications of synchrotron radiation==
*Synchrotron radiation of an electron beam circulating at high energy in a magnetic field leads to radiative self-polarization of electrons in the beam (Sokolov–Ternov effect). This effect is used for producing highly polarised electron beams for use in various experiments.
*Synchrotron radiation sets the beam sizes (determined by the beam emittance) in electron storage rings via the effects of radiation damping and quantum excitation.

== Beamlines ==

At a synchrotron facility, electrons are usually accelerated by a synchrotron, and then injected into a storage ring, in which they circulate, producing synchrotron radiation, but without gaining further energy. The radiation is projected at a tangent to the electron storage ring and captured by beamlines. These beamlines may originate at bending magnets, which mark the corners of the storage ring; or insertion devices, which are located in the straight sections of the storage ring. The spectrum and energy of X-rays differ between the two types. The beamline includes X-ray optical devices which control the bandwidth, photon flux, beam dimensions, focus, and collimation of the rays. The optical devices include slits, attenuators, crystal monochromators, and mirrors. The mirrors may be bent into curves or toroidal shapes to focus the beam. A high photon flux in a small area is the most common requirement of a beamline. The design of the beamline will vary with the application. At the end of the beamline is the experimental end station, where samples are placed in the line of the radiation, and detectors are positioned to measure the resulting diffraction, scattering or secondary radiation.

==Experimental techniques and usage==
Synchrotron light is an ideal tool for many types of research in materials science, physics, and chemistry and is used by researchers from academic, industrial, and government laboratories. Several methods take advantage of the high intensity, tunable wavelength, collimation, and polarization of synchrotron radiation at beamlines which are designed for specific kinds of experiments. The high intensity and penetrating power of synchrotron X-rays enables experiments to be performed inside sample cells designed for specific environments. Samples may be heated, cooled, or exposed to gas, liquid, or high pressure environments. Experiments which use these environments are called &quot;in situ&quot; and allow the characterization of atomic- to nano-scale phenomena which are inaccessible to most other characterization tools. &quot;In operando&quot; measurements are designed to mimic the real working conditions of a material as closely as possible.

===Diffraction and scattering===
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scattering experiments are performed at synchrotrons for the structural analysis of crystalline and amorphous materials. These measurements may be performed on powders, single crystals, or thin films. The high resolution and intensity of the synchrotron beam enables the measurement of scattering from dilute phases or the analysis of residual stress. Materials can be studied at high pressure using diamond anvil cells to simulate extreme geologic environments or to create exotic forms of matter.
X-ray crystallography of proteins and other macromolecules (PX or MX) are routinely performed. Synchrotron-based crystallography experiments were integral to solving the structure of the ribosome; this work earned the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009.

The size and shape of nanoparticles are characterized using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Nano-sized features on surfaces are measured with a similar technique, grazing-incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). In this and other methods, surface sensitivity is achieved by placing the crystal surface at a small angle relative to the incident beam, which achieves total external reflection and minimizes the X-ray penetration into the material.

The atomic- to nano-scale details of surfaces, interfaces, and thin films can be characterized using techniques such as X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and crystal truncation rod (CTR) analysis. X-ray standing wave (XSW) measurements can also be used to measure the position of atoms at or near surfaces; these measurements require high-resolution optics capable of resolving dynamical diffraction phenomena.

Amorphous materials, including liquids and melts, as well as crystalline materials with local disorder, can be examined using X-ray pair distribution function analysis, which requires high energy X-ray scattering data.

By tuning the beam energy through the absorption edge of a particular element of interest, the scattering from atoms of that element will be modified. These so-called resonant anomalous X-ray scattering methods can help to resolve scattering contributions from specific elements in the sample.

Other scattering techniques include energy dispersive X-ray diffraction, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and magnetic scattering.

===Spectroscopy===
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is used to study the coordination structure of atoms in materials and molecules. The synchrotron beam energy is tuned through the absorption edge of an element of interest, and modulations in the absorption are measured. Photoelectron transitions cause modulations near the absorption edge, and analysis of these modulations (called the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) or near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS)) reveals information about the chemical state and local symmetry of that element. At incident beam energies which are much higher than the absorption edge, photoelectron scattering causes &quot;ringing&quot; modulations called the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Fourier transformation of the EXAFS regime yields the bond lengths and number of the surrounding the absorbing atom; it is therefore useful for studying liquids and amorphous materials as well as sparse species such as impurities. A related technique, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), uses circularly polarized X-rays to measure the magnetic properties of an element.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can be performed at beamlines equipped with a photoelectron analyzer. Traditional XPS is typically limited to probing the top few nanometers of a material under vacuum. However, the high intensity of synchrotron light enables XPS measurements of surfaces at near-ambient pressures of gas. Ambient pressure XPS (AP-XPS) can be used to measure chemical phenomena under simulated catalytic or liquid conditions. Using high-energy photons yields high kinetic energy photoelectrons which have a much longer inelastic mean free path than those generated on a laboratory XPS instrument. The probing depth of synchrotron XPS can therefore be lengthened to several nanometers, allowing the study of buried interfaces. This method is referred to as high-energy X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). Furthermore, the tunable nature of the synchrotron X-ray photon energies presents a wide range of depth sensitivity in the order of 2-50 nm. This allows for probing of samples at greater depths and for non destructive depth-profiling experiments.

Material composition can be quantitatively analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF). XRF detection is also used in several other techniques, such as XAS and XSW, in which it is necessary to measure the change in absorption of a particular element.

Other spectroscopy techniques include angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), soft X-ray emission spectroscopy, and nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy, which is related to Mössbauer spectroscopy.

===Imaging===

Synchrotron X-rays can be used for traditional X-ray imaging, phase-contrast X-ray imaging, and tomography. The Ångström-scale wavelength of X-rays enables imaging well below the diffraction limit of visible light, but practically the smallest resolution so far achieved is about 30 nm. Such nanoprobe sources are used for scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). Imaging can be combined with spectroscopy such as X-ray fluorescence or X-ray absorption spectroscopy in order to map a sample&#x27;s chemical composition or oxidation state with sub-micron resolution.

Other imaging techniques include coherent diffraction imaging.

Similar optics can be employed for photolithography for MEMS structures can use a synchrotron beam as part of the LIGA process.

== Compact synchrotron light sources ==
Because of the usefulness of tuneable collimated coherent X-ray radiation, efforts have been made to make smaller more economical sources of the light produced by synchrotrons. The aim is to make such sources available within a research laboratory for cost and convenience reasons; at present, researchers have to travel to a facility to perform experiments. One method of making a compact light source is to use the energy shift from Compton scattering near-visible laser photons from electrons stored at relatively low energies of tens of megaelectronvolts (see for example the Compact Light Source (CLS)). However, a relatively low cross-section of collision can be obtained in this manner, and the repetition rate of the lasers is limited to a few hertz rather than the megahertz repetition rates naturally arising in normal storage ring emission. Another method is to use plasma acceleration to reduce the distance required to accelerate electrons from rest to the energies required for UV or X-ray emission within magnetic devices.

<doc id="379514" wikidata="Q7833768" url="?curid=379514" title="Transarmament">
<text>Transarmament (closely related to civilian-based defense) is the partial or total replacement of armed forces with the physical and social infrastructure to support nonviolent resistance. Gene Sharp defined transarmament as &quot;the process of changeover from a military-based defense policy to a civilian-based defense policy.&quot; Unlike disarmament, &quot;transarmament always involves the replacement of one means to provide defense with another&quot; instead of the &quot;simple reduction or abandonment of military capacity.&quot;

==Civilian defense==
The term &quot;transarmament&quot; appears to have been introduced in 1937 in a pamphlet by Kenneth Boulding. It appears not to have been used again until the 1960s.

According to Adam Roberts,
:At least four possible stages [of transarmament] can be envisaged:
:1. Research and investigation into civilian defence, in order to judge its workability, relate it to a specific country&#x27;s defence problems, and develop strategic and tactical concepts so that the proposal can be presented in concrete and practical terms.
:2. General public education in non-violent action and civilian defence; concentrated training of key groups and individuals; organizational preparations.
:3. Application of civilian defence in specific areas without complete abandonment of military defence policy.
:4. Public commitment to use civilian defence in resisting all threats formerly dealt with by military methods. Completion of process of transarment. (p. 338)

==Offensive to defensive==
&quot;Transarmament&quot; has later been used—for example, by Johan Galtung—as a technical term to describe a shift in military strategy. Galtung distinguishes between offensive and defense armaments and suggests transitioning to a defensive system of national defense. His use of the term does not imply nonviolence. Galtung advocates precise weapons with limited range and destructive effects.

<doc id="379518" wikidata="Q12014476" url="?curid=379518" title="Panoramic photography">
<text>Panoramic photography is a technique of photography, using specialized equipment or software, that captures images with horizontally elongated fields of view. It is sometimes known as &quot;wide format photography&quot;. The term has also been applied to a photograph that is cropped to a relatively wide aspect ratio, like the familiar letterbox format in wide-screen video.

While there is no formal division between &quot;wide-angle&quot; and &quot;panoramic&quot; photography, &quot;wide-angle&quot; normally refers to a type of lens, but using this lens type does not necessarily make an image a panorama. An image made with an ultra wide-angle fisheye lens covering the normal film frame of 1:1.33 is not automatically considered to be a panorama. An image showing a field of view approximating, or greater than, that of the human eye – about 160° by 75° – may be termed panoramic. This generally means it has an aspect ratio of 2:1 or larger, the image being at least twice as wide as it is high. The resulting images take the form of a wide strip. Some panoramic images have aspect ratios of 4:1 and sometimes 10:1, covering fields of view of up to 360 degrees. Both the aspect ratio and coverage of field are important factors in defining a true panoramic image.
Photo-finishers and manufacturers of Advanced Photo System (APS) cameras use the word &quot;panoramic&quot; to define any print format with a wide aspect ratio, not necessarily photos that encompass a large field of view.

==History==
The device of the panorama existed in painting, particularly in murals as early as A.D. 20 in those found in Pompeii, as a means of generating an immersive &#x27;panoptic&#x27; experience of a vista, long before the advent of photography. In the century prior to the advent of photography, and from 1787, with the work of Robert Barker, it reached a pinnacle of development in which whole buildings were constructed to house 360° panoramas, and even incorporated lighting effects and moving elements. Indeed, the careers of one of the inventors of photography, Daguerre, began in the production of popular panoramas and dioramas.

The idea and longing to create a detailed cityscape without a paintbrush, inspired Friedrich von Marten. von Marten created panoramic daguerreotype by using a special panoramic camera that he created himself. The camera could capture a broad view on a single daguerreotype plate. In complete and vivid detail, a cityscape is laid out before the viewer.

The development of panoramic cameras was a logical extension of the nineteenth-century fad for the panorama. One of the first recorded patents for a panoramic camera was submitted by Joseph Puchberger in Austria in 1843 for a hand-cranked, 150° field of view, 8-inch focal length camera that exposed a relatively large Daguerreotype, up to long. A more successful and technically superior panoramic camera was assembled the next year by Friedrich von Martens in Germany in 1844. His camera, the Megaskop, used curved plates and added the crucial feature of set gears, offering a relatively steady panning speed. As a result, the camera properly exposed the photographic plate, avoiding unsteady speeds that can create an unevenness in exposure, called &quot;banding&quot;. Martens was employed by Lerebours, a photographer/publisher. It is also possible that Martens camera was perfected before Puchberger patented his camera. Because of the high cost of materials and the technical difficulty of properly exposing the plates, Daguerreotype panoramas, especially those pieced together from several plates (see below) are rare.
After the advent of wet-plate collodion process, photographers would take anywhere from two to a dozen of the ensuing albumen prints and piece them together to form a panoramic image (&quot;see: Segmented&quot;). This photographic process was technically easier and far less expensive than Daguerreotypes. While William Stanley Jevons&#x27; wet-collodion &quot;Panorama of Port Jackson, New South Wales, from a high rock above Shell Cove, North Shore&quot; survived undiscovered until 1953 in his scrap-book of 1857, some of the most famous early panoramas were assembled this way by George N. Barnard, a photographer for the Union Army in the American Civil War in the 1860s. His work provided vast overviews of fortifications and terrain, much valued by engineers, generals, and artists alike. (&quot;see Photography and photographers of the American Civil War&quot;) In 1875, through remarkable effort, Bernard Otto Holtermann and Charles Bayliss coated twenty-three wet-plates measuring 56 by 46 centimetres to record a sweeping view of Sydney Harbour.

Following the invention of flexible film in 1888, panoramic photography was revolutionised. Dozens of cameras were marketed, many with brand names indicative of their era; such as the Pantascopic, (1862) Cylindrograph survey camera (1884), Kodak Panoram (1899), Wonder Panoramic (1890), and Cyclo-Pan (1970). More portable and simple to operate, and with the advantage of holding several panoramic views on the one roll, these cameras were enthusiastically deployed around the turn of the century by such photographers as the American adventurer Melvin Vaniman, who popularised the medium in Australia where it was taken up by both Pictorialist and postcard photographers, such as Robert Vere Scott, Richard T. Maurice (1859-1909), H.H. Tilbrook (1884-1937), and Harry Phillips (1873-1944).

==Panoramic cameras and methods==

=== Stereo Cyclographe ===
A camera with combined two-fixed focus panoramic camera in one mahogany-wooded box. The lenses were eight centimeters apart from each other with an indicator in between the lens to help the photographer set the camera level. A clock motor transported the nine-centimeter-wide film along with turning the shaft that rotated the camera. The camera could make a 9 × 80 cm pair that required a special viewer. These images were mostly used for mapping purposes.

=== Wonder Panoramic Camera ===
Made in 1890 in Berlin, Germany, by Rudolf Stirn, the Wonder Panoramic Camera needed the photographer for its motive power. A string, inside of the camera, hanging through a hole in the tripod screw, wound around a pulley inside the wooden box camera. To take a panoramic photo, the photographer swiveled the metal cap away from the lens to start the exposure. The rotation could be set for a full 360-degree view, producing an eighteen-inch-long negative.

=== Periphote ===
Built by Lumiere Freres of Paris in 1901. The Periphote had a spring-wound clock motor that rotated, and the inside barrier held the roll of film and its take-up spool. Attached to the body was a 55mm Jarret lens and a prism that directed the light through a half-millimeter-wide aperture at the film.

===Short rotation ===

&quot;Short rotation&quot;, &quot;rotating lens&quot; and &quot;swing lens&quot; cameras have a lens that rotates around the camera lens&#x27;s rear nodal point and use a curved film plane. As the photograph is taken, the lens pivots around its rear nodal point while a slit exposes a vertical strip of film that is aligned with the axis of the lens. The exposure usually takes a fraction of a second. Typically, these cameras capture a field of view between 110° and 140° and an aspect ratio of 2:1 to 4:1. The images produced occupy between 1.5 and 3 times as much space on the negative as the standard 24 mm x 36 mm 35 mm frame.

Cameras of this type include the Widelux, Noblex, and the Horizon. These have a negative size of approximately 24x58 mm. The Russian &quot;Spaceview FT-2&quot;, originally an artillery spotting camera, produced wider negatives, 12 exposures on a 36-exposure 35 mm film.

Short rotation cameras usually offer few shutter speeds and have poor focusing ability. Most models have a fixed focus lens, set to the hyperfocal distance of the maximum aperture of the lens, often at around . Photographers wishing to photograph closer subjects must use a small aperture to bring the foreground into focus, limiting the camera&#x27;s use in low-light situations.


Rotating lens cameras produce distortion of straight lines. This looks unusual because the image, which was captured from a sweeping, curved perspective, is being viewed flat. To view the image correctly, the viewer would have to produce a sufficiently large print and curve it identically to the curve of the film plane. This distortion can be reduced by using a swing-lens camera with a standard focal length lens. The FT-2 has a 50 mm while most other 35 mm swing lens cameras use a wide-angle lens, often 28 mm.
Similar distortion is seen in panoramas shot with digital cameras using in-camera stitching.


===Full rotation===
&quot;Rotating panoramic cameras&quot;, also called &quot;slit scan&quot; or &quot;scanning cameras&quot; are capable of 360° or greater degree of rotation. A clockwork or motorized mechanism rotates the camera continuously and pulls the film through the camera, so the motion of the film matches that of the image movement across the image plane. Exposure is made through a narrow slit. The central part of the image field produces a very sharp picture that is consistent across the frame.

Digital rotating line cameras image a 360° panorama line by line. Digital cameras in this style are the Panoscan and Eyescan. Analogue cameras include the Cirkut (1905), Leme (1962), Hulcherama (1979), Globuscope (1981), Seitz Roundshot (1988) and Lomography Spinner 360° (2010).

===Fixed lens===
&quot;Fixed lens&quot; cameras, also called &quot;flatback&quot;, &quot;wide view&quot; or &quot;wide field&quot;, have fixed lenses and a flat image plane. These are the most common form of panoramic camera and range from inexpensive APS cameras to sophisticated 6x17 cm and 6x24 cm medium format cameras. Panoramic cameras using sheet film are available in formats up to 10 x 24 inches. APS or 35 mm cameras produce cropped images in a panoramic aspect ratio using a small area of film. Specialized 35 mm or medium format fixed-lens panoramic cameras use wide field lenses to cover an extended length as well as the full height of the film to produce images with a greater image width than normal.

Pinhole cameras of a variety of constructions can be used to make panoramic images. A popular design is the &#x27;oatmeal box&#x27;, a vertical cylindrical container in which the pinhole is made in one side and the film or photographic paper is wrapped around the inside wall opposite, and extending almost right to the edge of, the pinhole. This generates an egg-shaped image with more than 180° view.

Because they expose the film in a single exposure, fixed lens cameras can be used with electronic flash, which would not work consistently with rotational panoramic cameras.

With a flat image plane, 90° is the widest field of view that can be captured in focus and without significant wide-angle distortion or vignetting. Lenses with an imaging angle approaching 120 degrees require a center filter to correct vignetting at the edges of the image. Lenses that capture angles of up to 180°, commonly known as fisheye lenses exhibit extreme geometrical distortion but typically display less brightness falloff than rectilinear lenses.

Examples of this type of camera are: Taiyokoki Viscawide-16 ST-D (16 mm film), Siciliano Camera Works Pannaroma (35mm, 1987), Hasselblad X-Pan (35 mm, 1998), Linhof 612PC, Horseman SW612, Linhof Technorama 617, Tomiyama Art Panorama 617 and 624, and Fuji G617 and GX617 (Medium format (film)).

The panomorph lens provides a full hemispheric field of view with no blind spot, unlike catadioptric lenses. 

==Digital photography==

===Digital stitching of segmented panoramas===
With digital photography, the most common method for producing panoramas is to take a series of pictures and stitch them together. There are two main types: the cylindrical panorama used primarily in stills photography and the spherical panorama used for virtual-reality images.

Segmented panoramas, also called &quot;stitched&quot; panoramas, are made by joining multiple photographs with slightly overlapping fields of view to create a panoramic image. Stitching software is used to combine multiple images. Ideally, in order to correctly stitch images together without parallax error, the camera must be rotated about the center of its lens entrance pupil. Stitching software can correct some parallax errors and different programs seem to vary in their ability to correct parallax errors. In general specific panorama software seems better at this than some of the built in stitching in general photomanipulation software.

===In-camera stitching of panoramas===

Some digital cameras especially smartphone cameras can do the stitching internally, sometimes in real time, either as a standard feature or by installing a smartphone app.
===Catadioptric cameras===
Lens- and mirror-based (catadioptric) cameras consist of lenses and curved mirrors that reflect a 360-degree field of view into the lens&#x27; optics. The mirror shape and lens used are specifically chosen and arranged so that the camera maintains a single viewpoint. The single viewpoint means the complete panorama is effectively imaged or viewed from a single point in space. One can simply warp the acquired image into a cylindrical or spherical panorama. Even perspective views of smaller fields of view can be accurately computed.

The biggest advantage of catadioptric systems (panoramic mirror lenses) is that because one uses mirrors to bend the light rays instead of lenses (like fish eye), the image has almost no chromatic aberrations or distortions. The image, a reflection of the surface on the mirror, is in the form of a doughnut to which software is applied in order to create a flat panoramic picture. Such software is normally supplied by the company who produces the system. Because the complete panorama is imaged at once, dynamic scenes can be captured without problems. Panoramic video can be captured and has found applications in robotics and journalism. The mirror lens system uses only a partial section of the digital camera&#x27;s sensor and therefore some pixels are not used. Recommendations are always to use a camera with a high pixel count in order to maximize the resolution of the final image.

There are even inexpensive add-on catadioptric lenses for smartphones, such as the GoPano micro and Kogeto Dot.

== Vertorama ==

A vertical panorama or vertorama is a panorama with an upright orientation instead of a horizontal. It is created using the same techniques as when making a horizontal panorama.

==Artistic uses==

=== Strip panoramas ===

Ed Ruscha&#x27;s &quot;Every Building on the Sunset Strip&quot; (1966) was made by photographing building facades contiguously as seen from the back of a pickup truck traveling a 4 km length of the street. In the ironically &#x27;deadpan&#x27; spirit of his work at the time, he published the work in strip form in a foldout book, intended to be viewed from one end or the other to see either side of &#x27;The Strip&#x27; in correct orientation.

Preceding Ruscha&#x27;s work, in 1954, Yoshikazu Suzuki produced an accordion-fold panorama of every building on Ginza Street, Tokyo in the Japanese architecture book &quot;Ginza, Kawaii, Ginza Haccho&quot;.

=== Joiners ===
Joiners (for which the terms &quot;panography&quot; and &quot;panograph&quot; have been used) is a photographic technique in which one picture is assembled from several overlapping photographs. This can be done manually with prints or by using digital image editing software and may resemble a wide-angle or panoramic view of a scene, similar in effect to segmented panoramic photography or image stitching. A joiner is distinct because the overlapping edges between adjacent pictures are not removed; the edge becomes part of the picture. &#x27;Joiners&#x27; or &#x27;panography&#x27; is thus a type of photomontage and a sub-set of collage.

Artist David Hockney is an early and important contributor to this technique. Through his fascination with human vision, his efforts to render a subjective view in his artworks resulted in the manual montaging of 10x15cm high-street-processed prints of (often several entire) 35mm films as a solution. He called the resulting cut-and-paste montages &quot;joiners&quot;, and one of his most famous is &quot;Pearblossom Highway&quot;, held by the Getty Museum. His group was called the &quot;Hockney joiners&quot;, and he still paints and photographs joiners today.

Jan Dibbets&#x27; &quot;Dutch Mountain&quot; series (c.1971) relies on stitching of panoramic sequences to make a mountain of the Netherlands seaside.

=== Revivalists ===

In the 1970s and 1980s, a school of art photographers took up panoramic photography, inventing new cameras and using found and updated antique cameras to revive the format. The new panoramists included Kenneth Snelson, David Avison, Art Sinsabaugh, and Jim Alinder.

===Digital stitching ===

Andreas Gursky frequently employs digital stitching in his large-format panoramic imagery.

<doc id="379520" wikidata="Q2568395" url="?curid=379520" title="Hexomino">
<text>A hexomino (or 6-omino) is a polyomino of order 6; that is, a polygon in the plane made of 6 equal-sized squares connected edge to edge. The name of this type of figure is formed with the prefix . When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there are 35 different &quot;free&quot; hexominoes. When reflections are considered distinct, there are 60 &quot;one-sided&quot; hexominoes. When rotations are also considered distinct, there are 216 &quot;fixed&quot; hexominoes.

==Symmetry==
The figure above shows all 35 possible free hexominoes, coloured according to their symmetry groups:
* The twenty grey hexominoes have no symmetry. Their symmetry group consists only of the identity mapping.
* The six red hexominoes have an axis of mirror symmetry parallel to the gridlines. Their symmetry group has two elements, the identity and a reflection in a line parallel to the sides of the squares.
* The two green hexominoes have an axis of mirror symmetry at 45° to the gridlines. Their symmetry group has two elements, the identity and a diagonal reflection.
* The five blue hexominoes have point symmetry, also known as rotational symmetry of order 2. Their symmetry group has two elements, the identity and the 180° rotation.
* The two purple hexominoes have two axes of mirror symmetry, both parallel to the gridlines (thus one horizontal axis and one vertical axis). Their symmetry group has four elements. It is the dihedral group of order 2, also known as the Klein four-group.

If reflections of a hexomino are considered distinct, as they are with one-sided hexominoes, then the first and fourth categories above would each double in size, resulting in an extra 25 hexominoes for a total of 60. If rotations are also considered distinct, then the hexominoes from the first category count eightfold, the ones from the next three categories count fourfold, and the ones from the last category count twice. This results in 20 × 8 + (6 + 2 + 5) × 4 + 2 × 2 = 216 fixed hexominoes.

== Packing and tiling ==
Each of the 35 hexominoes satisfies the Conway criterion; hence, every hexomino is capable of tiling the plane.

Although a complete set of 35 hexominoes has a total of 210 squares, it is not possible to pack them into a rectangle. (Such an arrangement is possible with the 12 pentominoes, which can be packed into any of the rectangles 3 × 20, 4 × 15, 5 × 12 and 6 × 10.) A simple way to demonstrate that such a packing of hexominoes is not possible is via a parity argument. If the hexominoes are placed on a checkerboard pattern, then 11 of the hexominoes will cover an even number of black squares (either 2 white and 4 black or vice versa) and the other 24 hexominoes will cover an odd number of black squares (3 white and 3 black). Overall, an even number of black squares will be covered in any arrangement. However, any rectangle of 210 squares will have 105 black squares and 105 white squares, and therefore cannot be covered by the 35 hexominoes.

However, there are other simple figures of 210 squares that can be packed with the hexominoes. For example, a 15 × 15 square with a 3 × 5 rectangle removed from the centre has 210 squares. With checkerboard colouring, it has 106 white and 104 black squares (or vice versa), so parity does not prevent a packing, and a packing is indeed possible. It is also possible for two sets of pieces to fit a rectangle of size 420, or for the set of 60 one-sided hexominoes (18 of which cover an even number of black squares) to fit a rectangle of size 360.

==Polyhedral nets for the cube==

A polyhedral net for the cube is necessarily a hexomino, with 11 hexominoes (shown at right) actually being nets. They appear on the right, again coloured according to their symmetry groups.

A polyhedral net for the cube cannot contain the O-tetromino, nor the I-pentomino, the U-pentomino, or the V-pentomino.

<doc id="379523" wikidata="Q1856554" url="?curid=379523" title="Wall of Sound">
<text>The Wall of Sound (also called the Spector Sound) is a music production formula developed by American record producer Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios, in the 1960s, with assistance from engineer Larry Levine and the conglomerate of session musicians later known as &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot;. The intention was to exploit the possibilities of studio recording to create an unusually dense orchestral aesthetic that came across well through radios and jukeboxes of the era. Spector explained in 1964: &quot;I was looking for a sound, a sound so strong that if the material was not the greatest, the sound would carry the record. It was a case of augmenting, augmenting. It all fit together like a jigsaw.&quot;

A popular misconception holds that the Wall of Sound was created simply through a maximum of noise and distortion, but the method was actually far more nuanced. To attain the Wall of Sound, Spector&#x27;s arrangements called for large ensembles (including some instruments not generally used for ensemble playing, such as electric and acoustic guitars), with multiple instruments doubling or tripling many of the parts to create a fuller, richer tone. For example, Spector often duplicated a part played by an acoustic piano with an electric piano and a harpsichord. Mixed well enough, the three instruments would then be indistinguishable to the listener.

Among other features of the sound, Spector incorporated an array of orchestral instruments (strings, woodwind, brass and percussion) not previously associated with youth-oriented pop music. Reverb from an echo chamber was also highlighted for additional texture. He characterized his methods as &quot;a Wagnerian approach to rock &amp; roll: little symphonies for the kids&quot;. The combination of large ensembles with reverberation effects also increased the average audio power in a way that resembles compression. By 1979, the use of compression had become common on the radio, marking the trend that led to the loudness war in the 1980s.

The intricacies of the technique were unprecedented in the field of sound production for popular music. According to Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson, who used the formula extensively: &quot;In the &#x27;40s and &#x27;50s, arrangements were considered &#x27;OK here, listen to that French horn&#x27; or &#x27;listen to this string section now.&#x27; It was all a definite sound. There weren&#x27;t combinations of sound and, with the advent of Phil Spector, we find sound combinations, which—scientifically speaking—is a brilliant aspect of sound production.&quot;

== Origins ==
During the late 1950s, Spector worked with Brill Building songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller during a period when they sought a fuller sound by the use of excessive instrumentation, using up to five electric guitars and four percussionists. Later this evolved into Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound, which Leiber and Stoller considered to be very distinct from what they were doing, stating: &quot;Phil was the first one to use multiple drum kits, three pianos and so on. We went for much more clarity in terms of instrumental colors, and he deliberately blended everything into a kind of mulch. He definitely had a different point of view.&quot;

Spector&#x27;s first production was the self-penned 1958 song &quot;Don&#x27;t You Worry My Little Pet&quot;, performed with his group the Teddy Bears. The recording was achieved by taking a demo tape of the song and playing it back over the studio&#x27;s speaker system to overdub another performance over it. The end product was a cacophony, with stacked harmony vocals that could not be heard clearly. Spector spent the next several years further developing this unorthodox method of recording.

In the 1960s, Spector usually worked at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles because of its exceptional echo chambers. He also typically worked with such audio engineers as Larry Levine and the conglomerate of session musicians who later became known as The Wrecking Crew.

==Etymology==
Andrew Loog Oldham coined the phrase &quot;Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound&quot; within advertisements for the Righteous Brothers 1964 single &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;. An earlier usage of the phrase &quot;wall of sound&quot; was made in reference to the instrumentation of jazz artist Stan Kenton, who utilized numerous brass instruments to create a vibrating sound that jolted human ears.

== Process ==

===Layering===
The process was almost the same for most of Spector&#x27;s recordings, with Spector starting by rehearsing the assembled musicians for several hours before recording. The backing track was performed live and recorded monaurally; a bass drum overdub on &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; was the exception to the rule.

Songwriter Jeff Barry, who worked extensively with Spector, described the Wall of Sound as &quot;by and large ... a formula arrangement&quot; with &quot;four or five guitars ... two basses in fifths, with the same type of line ... strings ... six or seven horns adding the little punches ... [and] percussion instruments—the little bells, the shakers, the tambourines&quot;.

Bob B. Soxx &amp; the Blue Jeans&#x27; version of &quot;Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; formed the basis of Spector and Levine&#x27;s future mixing practices, almost never straying from the formula it established. For the recording of &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;, engineer Larry Levine described the process thus: they started by recording four acoustic guitars, playing eight bars over and over again, changing the figure if necessary until Spector thought it ready. They then added the pianos, of which there were three, and if they didn&#x27;t work together, Spector started again with the guitars. This is followed by three basses, the horns (two trumpets, two trombones, and three saxophones), then finally the drums. The vocals were then added with Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield singing into separate microphones and backing vocals supplied by the Blossoms and other singers.

Daniel Lanois recounted a situation during the recording of the track &quot;Goodbye&quot; from Emmylou Harris&#x27;s &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;: &quot;We put a huge amount of compression on the piano and the mandoguitar, and it turned into this fantastic, chimey harmonic instrument. We almost got the old Spector &#x27;60s sound, not by layering, but by really compressing what was already there between the melodic events happening between these two instruments.&quot; Nonetheless, layering identical instrumental parts remained an integral component of many of Spector&#x27;s productions, as session musician Barney Kessel recalled:

All early Wall of Sound recordings were made with a three-track Ampex 350 tape recorder. Levine explained that during mixing, &quot;I [would] record the same thing on two of the [Ampex machine&#x27;s] three tracks just to reinforce the sound, and then I would erase one of those and replace it with the voice. The console had a very limited equalizer for each input ... That was basically it in terms of effects, aside from the two echo chambers that were also there, of course, directly behind the control room.&quot;

=== Echo ===
Microphones in the recording studio captured the musicians&#x27; performance, which was then transmitted to an echo chamber—a basement room fitted with speakers and microphones. The signal from the studio was played through the speakers and reverberated throughout the room before being picked up by the microphones. The echo-laden sound was then channeled back to the control room, where it was recorded on tape. The natural reverberation and echo from the hard walls of the echo chamber gave Spector&#x27;s productions their distinctive quality and resulted in a rich, complex sound that, when played on AM radio, had a texture rarely heard in musical recordings. Jeff Barry said: &quot;Phil used his own formula for echo, and some overtone arrangements with the strings.&quot;

=== Spill ===

During the mixing for &quot;Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;, Spector turned off the track designated for electric guitar (played on this occasion by Billy Strange). However, the sound of the guitar could still be heard spilling onto other microphones in the room, creating a ghostly ambiance that obscured the instrument. In reference to this nuance of the song&#x27;s recording, music professor Albin Zak has written:

Levine disliked Spector&#x27;s penchant for mic bleeding, accordingly: &quot;I never wanted all the bleed between instruments – I had it, but I never wanted it – and since I had to live with it, that meant manipulating other things to lessen the effect; bringing the guitars up just a hair and the drums down just a hair so that it didn&#x27;t sound like it was bleeding.&quot; In order to offset the mixing problems percussion leakage caused, he applied a minimal number of microphones to the drum kits, using Neumann U 67s overhead and an RCA Type 77 on the kick to establish a feeling of presence.

=== Mono ===
According to Zak: &quot;Aside from the issues of retail and radio exposure, mono recordings represented an aesthetic frame for musicians and producers, who had grown up with them.&quot; Despite the trend toward multi-channel recording, Spector was vehemently opposed to stereo releases, claiming that it took control of the record&#x27;s sound away from the producer in favor of the listener, resulting in an infringement of the Wall of Sound&#x27;s carefully balanced combination of sonic textures as they were meant to be heard. Brian Wilson agreed, stating: &quot;I look at sound like a painting, you have a balance and the balance is conceived in your mind. You finish the sound, dub it down, and you’ve stamped out a picture of your balance with the mono dubdown. But in stereo, you leave that dubdown to the listener—to his speaker placement and speaker balance. It just doesn&#x27;t seem complete to me.&quot;

== Misconceptions ==
===As a maximum of noise===
It has been inaccurately suggested in critical shorthand that Spector&#x27;s &quot;wall of sound&quot; filled every second with a maximum of noise. Levine recalled how &quot;other engineers&quot; mistakenly thought that the process was &quot;turning up all the faders to get full saturation, but all that achieved was distortion.&quot; Biographer David Hinckley wrote that the Wall of Sound was flexible, more complex, and more subtle, elaborating:

The Wall of Sound has been contrasted with &quot;the standard pop mix of foregrounded solo vocal and balanced, blended backing&quot; as well as the airy mixes typical of reggae and funk. Musicologist Richard Middleton wrote: &quot;This can be contrasted with the &quot;open&quot; spaces and more &quot;equal&quot; lines of typical funk and reggae textures [for example], which seem to invite [listeners] to insert [themselves] in those spaces and actively participate.&quot; Supporting this, Jeff Barry said, &quot;[Spector] buried the lead and he &quot;cannot stop&quot; himself from doing that ... if you listen to his records in sequence, the lead goes further and further in and to me what he is saying is, &#x27;It is &quot;not&quot; the song... just listen to those &quot;strings&quot;. I want &quot;more&quot; musicians, it&#x27;s &quot;me&quot;.

Closer reflection reveals that the Wall of Sound was compatible with, even supportive of, vocal protagonism. Such virtuosity was ultimately serving of Spector&#x27;s own agenda—The Righteous Brothers&#x27; vocal prowess provided him a &quot;secure and prosperous headrest&quot;, such as in Bobby Hatfield&#x27;s rendering of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;.

===As a generic term===
According to author Matthew Bannister, Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound is distinct from what is typically characterized as a &quot;wall of sound&quot; in rock music. Bannister writes that, during the 1980s, &quot;Jangle and drone plus reverberation create[d] a contemporary equivalent of Spector&#x27;s &#x27;Wall of Sound&#x27; – a massive, ringing, cavernous noise and a device used by many indie groups: Flying Nun, from Sneaky Feelings&#x27; &quot;Send You&quot; to Straitjacket Fits and the JPS Experience&quot;. He cites 1960s psychedelic and garage rock such as the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; (1966) as a primary musical influence on the movement.

== Legacy and popularity ==

=== Phil Spector ===
The Wall of Sound forms the foundation of Phil Spector&#x27;s recordings. Certain records are considered to have epitomized its use. Spector himself is quoted as believing his production of Ike and Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; to be the summit of his Wall of Sound productions, and this sentiment has been echoed by George Harrison, who called it &quot;a perfect record from start to finish&quot;.

=== Brian Wilson ===
Outside of Spector&#x27;s own songs, the most recognizable example of the &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; is heard on many classic hits recorded by The Beach Boys (e.g., &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot;—and especially, the psychedelic &quot;pocket symphony&quot; of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;), for which Brian Wilson used a similar recording technique, especially during the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; eras of the band. Wilson considers &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; to be a concept album centered around interpretations of Phil Spector&#x27;s recording methods. Author Domenic Priore observed, &quot;The Ronettes had sung a dynamic version of The Students&#x27; 1961 hit &#x27;I&#x27;m So Young&#x27;, and Wilson went right for it, but took the Wall of Sound in a different direction. Where Phil would go for total effect by bringing the music to the edge of cacophony – and therefore rocking to the tenth power – Brian seemed to prefer audio clarity. His production method was to spread out the sound and arrangement, giving the music a more lush, comfortable feel.&quot;

According to Larry Levine, &quot;Brian was one of the few people in the music business Phil respected. There was a mutual respect. Brian might say that he learned how to produce from watching Phil, but the truth is, he was already producing records before he observed Phil. He just wasn&#x27;t getting credit for it, something that in the early days, I remember really used to make Phil angry. Phil would tell anybody who listened that Brian was one of the great producers.&quot;

=== Others ===


After Sonny Bono was fired from Philles Records, he signed up with Atlantic Records and recruited some of Spector&#x27;s colleagues to create &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; (which went to No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) and &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Go&quot; (No. 8), both of which featured elements of the Wall of Sound, among other songs. Similarly, when the Righteous Brothers ended their relationship with Spector and signed with Verve/MGM Records in 1966, they released &quot;(You&#x27;re My) Soul and Inspiration&quot;, which Medley produced using this approach and also reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and stayed at the top for three weeks.

One of the earliest persons outside of Spector&#x27;s talent pool to adopt the Wall of Sound approach was British producer Johnny Franz, specifically his work with Dusty Springfield and the Walker Brothers, with songs such as &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Say You Love Me&quot; for the former and &quot;Make It Easy On Yourself&quot; and &quot;The Sun Ain&#x27;t Gonna Shine (Anymore)&quot; for the latter (both of which were No. 1 hits in the United Kingdom).

Another was the productions of Shadow Morton, such as his work with the Shangri-Las, one of which, &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;, went to No. 1 in the United States. According to Billy Joel (who played piano in another Shangri-Las song, &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot;), Morton aspired to become the Phil Spector of the East Coast.

Another prominent example that reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 was Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;, which utilized the Wall of Sound with great effect towards the end, with the help of the Wrecking Crew. The production was modeled on the Righteous Brothers&#x27; version of &quot;Old Man River&quot;, and Art Garfunkel has explicitly compared it to the Spector-produced &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Spector&#x27;s work with the Righteous Brothers also influenced the R&amp;B band Checkmates, Ltd., with songs such as &quot;I Can Hear the Rain&quot;, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Take My World Away&quot;, and &quot;Walk in the Sunlight&quot;. It was because of such experiments that their manager sought to secure Spector&#x27;s involvement for their second album, &quot;Love Is All We Have to Give&quot;.

In 1973, British band Wizzard revived the Wall of Sound in three of their hits &quot;See My Baby Jive&quot;, &quot;Angel Fingers&quot; and &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot;. &quot;See My Baby Jive&quot; later influenced ABBA&#x27;s song &quot;Waterloo&quot;.

ABBA also utilized the technique for songs starting with &quot;People Need Love&quot; and fully realized with songs such as &quot;Ring Ring&quot;, &quot;Waterloo&quot;, and &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;; prior to recording &quot;Ring Ring&quot;, engineer Michael B. Tretow had read Richard Williams&#x27; book &quot;Out of His Head: The Sound of Phil Spector&quot;, which inspired him to layer multiple instrumental overdubs on the band&#x27;s recordings to simulate an orchestra, becoming an integral part of ABBA&#x27;s sound. Bruce Springsteen also emulated the Wall of Sound in his album &quot;Born to Run&quot;, starting with the titular song, backed by the E Street Band. The E Street Band would become famous practitioners of this method, with songs such as Ronnie Spector&#x27;s cover of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; (itself conceived as a tribute to the Ronettes).

Jim Steinman and Todd Rundgren, composer and producer of Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, respectively, utilized the Wall of Sound for the album. Steinman composed the songs based on Spector&#x27;s productions as well as Wagner and Springsteen (also including the E Street Band&#x27;s Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg on piano and drums, respectively), with the title track also being influenced by songs such as &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;. As with Brian Wilson, Steinman had aimed to create &quot;anthems to the kind of feeling you get listening to &#x27;Be My Baby for the album. Steinman would later similarly utilize such instrumentation in his own productions for other songs, such as Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; (produced specifically in Spector&#x27;s model), to the point that his discography ranging from Air Supply (&quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;) to Celine Dion (&quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;) has been described as an &quot;alternate-universe Wall of Sound&quot;. When asked about his involvement with Dion for songs such as &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; in the album &quot;Falling Into You&quot;, Spector denounced Steinman and other producers as &quot;amateurs, students, and bad clones of yours truly&quot;, to which Steinman responded, &quot;I’m thrilled to be insulted by Phil Spector. He’s my God, my idol. To be insulted by Phil Spector is a big honor. If he spits on me I consider myself purified.&quot;

Wagnerian rock derives its characterization from a merge between Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound and the operas of Richard Wagner.

<text>35 (thirty-five) is the natural number following 34 and preceding 36

== In mathematics ==
35 is the sum of the first five triangular numbers, making it a tetrahedral number.

35 is the 10th discrete semiprime (formula_1) and the first with 5 as the lowest non-unitary factor, thus being the first of the form (5.q) where q is a higher prime.

35 has two prime factors, (5 and 7) which also form its main factor pair (5 x 7) and comprise the second twin-prime distinct semiprime pair.

The aliquot sum of 35 is 13, within an aliquot sequence of only one composite number (35,13,1,0) to the Prime in the 13-aliquot tree. 35 is the second composite number with the aliquot sum 13; the first being the cube 27. 

35 is the last member of the first triple cluster of semiprimes 33, 34, 35. The second such triple distinct semiprime cluster is 85, 86, and 87.

35 is the number of ways that three things can be selected from a set of seven unique things, also known as the &quot;combination of seven things taken three at a time&quot;.

35 is a centered cube number, a centered tetrahedral number, a pentagonal number, and a pentatope number.

35 is a highly cototient number, since there are more solutions to the equation formula_2 than there are for any other integers below it except 1.

There are 35 free hexominoes, the polyominoes made from six squares.

Since the greatest prime factor of formula_3 is 613, which is more than 35 twice, 35 is a Størmer number.

35 is the highest number one can count to on one&#x27;s fingers using senary.

35 is the number of quasigroups of order 4.

35 is the smallest composite number of the form formula_4, where is a non-negative integer.

<text>The Broadmoor Manitou and Pikes Peak Cog Railway (also known as the Pikes Peak Cog Railway) is a cog railway that climbs one of the most iconic mountains in the United States, Pikes Peak in Colorado. The base station is in Manitou Springs, near Colorado Springs.

Construction on the line was started in 1889 and the first train reached the summit on June 30, 1891. Cog railways are common in Switzerland and found in other parts of the world (totaling about 50 lines), but this is one of only three such lines remaining in the United States, the others being the older Mount Washington Cog Railway in New Hampshire, and the short Quincy and Torch Lake Cog Railway.

Originally powered by steam locomotives, the line later switched over to diesel-powered locomotives and self-propelled railcars. The railway was closed between October 29, 2017 and May 20, 2021, for a complete refurbishment that saw the replacement of the track infrastructure, the rebuild of older railcars and the purchase of three new trainsets.

==History==
The idea for the railroad came in 1888, after a trip to the summit by inventor Zalmon G. Simmons, who had founded previously the Simmons Bedding Company. Simmons had designed a wooden telegraph insulator while on the board of directors of Western Union, and was surveying Englemann Canyon for telegraph lines to the top of Pikes Peak. It was a miserable two-day trip on a mule and after his return, Simmons was convinced that there needed to be a more &quot;civilized&quot; mode of travel to the summit of Pikes Peak and decided to fund the construction of a railway.

The line would start at a depot in the town of Manitou Springs, located at an elevation of , and climb to the summit of Pikes Peak at an elevation of . The average grade of the line would be 12% but would top out at 25%. Normal trains can not retain traction on the rails at grades steeper than 10%, so the railway would need to use a cog and rack system to help pull trains up the mountain and control the speed of the descent.
Construction was started in 1889, being built by Italian laborers using only pickaxes and assisted by donkeys. The line was built as a standard-gauge railway with an Abt rack system and wooden ties. Limited service was started in 1890 on the first segment of the line from Manitou Springs to the Halfway House Hotel. On June 30, 1891, the first train reached the summit.

Three steam locomotives were built for the line by the Baldwin Locomotive Works that each featured boilers offset by 16 degrees to keep them level on the steeply inclined grades. While most locomotives pull rail cars, these steam engines would push the line&#x27;s wooden passenger cars up the mountain, decreasing the chance of a runaway car. 

A fourth steam locomotive was added to the fleet in 1892 (which was built as a Vauclain compound), which proved to be more efficient and cut the cost of operating on a steep incline. The locomotive was so successful that the original locomotives were rebuilt as Vauclain compounds in 1893. Over time, the Vauclain compound technology made the locomotives notoriously difficult to maintain. An additional locomotive was added to the fleet in 1901 and again in 1906. All six steam locomotives were rebuilt in 1912 to similar specifications and would burn slightly under 1 ton of coal per trip.

Just before the start of the Great Depression, Spencer Penrose purchased a stake in the line. Penrose was the owner of The Broadmoor, a well-known hotel in Colorado Springs.

Under the control of Penrose, there was an effort to find more economical ways to operate the line. To that end, gasoline-powered railcar #7 was constructed in 1938. The railcar was intended to be a cheaper alternative to operating steam locomotives during quieter times of the year. The railcar was a huge success, and led the railroad to purchase five &#x27;streamlined&#x27; diesel locomotives from General Electric, which were equipped with matching passenger cars, acquired from 1939 onward. 

The diesel locomotives slowly supplanted the steam locomotives, though some steam operations persisted until the 1960s as backup power and to operate the snow-clearing train (where their greater weight meant they were less likely to derail).

The railroad started switching over to a fleet of self-propelled railcars in 1964, purchasing two units (#14 and #15) from Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM), which would be similar to equipment used on many Swiss cog railways. The air-cooled, 8-cylinder diesel engines in the first units proved to be less than satisfactory on the railroad above the tree line and were replaced by water-cooled engines. The railcars proved to be a good addition to the fleet and the railroad purchased two more railcars (#16 and #17) in 1968.

As tourism increased in the 1970s the railway needed more capacity. In 1976, the railway took delivery from SLM of two larger railcars (#18 and #19). These are identical in cosmetic appearance to cars 14-17, however consist of two articulated cars. Passing sidings were built at Minnehaha and Windy Point, allowing trains to pass at various points on the hill. Trains could previously pass only at Mountain View, permitting only three trains a day up the mountain. Eight trains per day became possible with the new equipment and sidings. Two additional two-car trainsets were added in the 1980s (#24 in 1984 and #25 in 1989).

By the 2000s, the rail infrastructure was starting to show its age. Railway managers reported that in 2017 the track geometry had become so poor that the cog wheels were wearing out twice as quickly as they did in the 1980s. Winter operations were suspended on October 29, 2017, to conduct maintenance on the railway, but crews soon realized more serious repairs were needed and in March 2018 it was announced that the railway would close indefinitely. 

The Anschutz Corporation, which owned the railway, estimated a full refurbishment of the line would cost $100 million. The company negotiated a deal with the city of Manitou Springs that would provide $36 million in tax breaks for the railroad over a 50-year period if the company completed the upgrades. The agreement was signed on November 20, 2018.

The major refurbishment project would involve the near-complete replacement of the track infrastructure, the rebuild of facilities and older railcars and the purchase of three new trainsets.

Starting in March 2019, crews ripped up the old rails, Abt rack system, and wooden ties, some of which had been in place since the line was first built in 1889. Work started at the depot in Manitou Springs and reached the summit in September. In May 2020, crews began working down from the top, laying down metal ties, new rails custom ordered from Poland and a new Strub rack system which featured more robust teeth. Crews also replaced the old manual track switches with radio-controlled versions that would enable faster operations at the passing sidings.

While the track work was underway, crews at the railroad shops in Manitou Springs began to rebuild the four two-car SLM railcars (Nos. 18, 19, 24 and 25). Each railcar was converted to the new Strub system, received a new transmission with a retarder for dynamic braking and was repowered with new diesel engines.

The railroad also placed an order for three trainsets (Nos. 27, 28 and 29) from Stadler Rail of Switzerland. Each trainset would consist of a diesel-electric locomotive, two coaches and a control car, and marked a return to locomotive-hauled trains. Additionally, a snowblower (No. 30) was ordered from Stadler&#x27;s partner, Zaugg AG Eggiwill of Switzerland. The snowblower has a diesel engine to turn its blades, but it is not self-propelled and instead acts as a control car and pushed by one of the Stadler locomotives. In February 2021, the new equipment was shipped from Switzerland to the United States, arriving in Manitou Springs the next month.

Meanwhile, the city of Colorado Springs (which operates the Pikes Peak Highway) built a new visitor center at the summit, while the railroad built a new platform. Down in Manitou Springs, the depot received a second boarding track and platform.

The line reopened on May 20, 2021. The cost has increased over the years. In 2023, the price for auto-assigned seatings was USD$58.50 (adults) / USD$48.50 (age 12 and under); or USD$71 / USD$61 for reserved seating.

===Manitou Incline===

More commonly called simply the Manitou Incline, the Mount Manitou Scenic Incline Railway was actually a funicular up the side of a peak called &quot;Rocky Mountain&quot; located adjacent to Mount Manitou. It was operated by the Manitou and Pike&#x27;s Peak Railway until its closure following a rockslide in 1990. This line&#x27;s lower terminus was adjacent to the Cog Railway base station in Manitou Springs. The Manitou Incline averaged almost a 40% grade, gaining in elevation over a length of approximately , with the maximum grade being 68%.

The Manitou Incline was initially built in 1907 for use in the construction of city water lines and a hydroelectric plant. When the construction was finished, the Manitou and Pike&#x27;s Peak Railway took over the cable car as a tourist operation.

From 1990 forward, the defunct Incline had been controversial because, although legally off-limits to the public, its roadbed was heavily used for recreation and exercise by people ignoring the trespassing signs. It became legal to use the Incline on February 1, 2013. Colorado Springs Parks and Recreation manages the Incline trail through an intergovernmental agreement.

<text>Mickey&#x27;s Polo Team is a 1936 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists. The cartoon features a game of polo played between four Disney characters, led by Mickey Mouse, and four cartoon versions of real-life movie stars. It was directed by David Hand and was first released on January 4, 1936. The film was inspired by Walt Disney&#x27;s personal love of polo. It was the 80th Mickey Mouse short film to be released, and the first of that year.

The cartoon features cameos of many Disney characters from the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; film series, as well as several real-world 1930s entertainment figures.

==Plot==
Mickey Mouse is participating in a polo game, with a team that includes Goofy, the Big Bad Wolf, and Donald Duck, who is having trouble with his donkey. They are playing against Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Harpo Marx, and Charlie Chaplin (for which he is in his Tramp outfit). Actor Jack Holt, who is serving as referee, throws the ball, which begins the game. First out is Oliver, who is knocked off his horse when the two teams fight to get the ball from the other. He is hit on the head with horseshoes while on the ground. The Big Bad Wolf takes the ball and manages to keep it ahead of the others but Charlie Chaplin soon steals the ball and hits it into one of the poles, using his cane to turn himself around to go in the other direction and keep up with the team. Meanwhile, Ollie is struggling to get back on his horse because of his overweight body. As Mickey hits the ball toward his home goal, Harpo Marx and his ostrich are forced to duck under the sand to avoid being hit. Ollie is finally able to get onto his horse but his weight causes the horse&#x27;s body to sag in the middle.

In an attempt to make the horse stay up, Stan Laurel pulls Ollie&#x27;s horse&#x27;s tail out and ties it in a knot, which works. However, the horse refuses to get back in the game and no matter how hard Ollie tries to entice it, it stays in place. Stan tries to poke it with a needle to make it get going, but it takes off before he can do so, throwing Ollie off and having him get poked instead. In the game, the Big Bad Wolf takes the lead with the ball again, but loses his mallet in the process and uses his breath to make the ball go forward instead. Shirley Temple and The Three Little Pigs mock him for doing this and blow raspberries at him. He gets angry and pushes back by blowing the fence they are behind away and clouding them with dust, but the distraction causes him to lose his lead in the game. Donald Duck takes the lead and hits the ball, but Harpo Marx hits the ball back at him and the momentum behind the two to get the ball ends with them colliding.

Donald yells insults at him for knocking him off, but Harpo responds by punching him with boxers&#x27; mitts that he hides in his clothes, burns Donald with a blowtorch and uses a noisemaker to push him away, back to his donkey. The ball lands right next to him and he tries to hit it but the team takes it away. Frustrated, he tries to get his donkey to move but it sits on him, laughing. It then kicks him into the ground where the ball lands on his tail and he is trampled by the other players (including Ollie, who finally manages to get back in the game). Donald throws a tantrum and accidentally swallows the ball, causing the teams to chase after him to get it out. Harpo hits him first, using the head of his ostrich, and the Big Bad Wolf manages to briefly get the ball out by hitting him but it bounces back inside Donald. All of the players from both teams try to hit him which eventually causes him to dig into the sand to escape. Donald tries to hide inside a pole but the teams continue to try to hit him out. Finally, he rips the pole off its base and leads both teams toward referee Jack Holt, which causes everyone to collide and make the horses end up riding their owners and continue the game in that way.

==Reception==
&quot;The Film Daily&quot; called the short &quot;a knockout&quot;, saying: &quot;For fast and furious animated entertainment, this just about tops anything turned out to date by the Walt Disney shops... It was a grand idea and the Disney boys put a lot of ingenuity and effort into it, resulting in a cartoon comedy that is one big riot from start to finish.&quot;

<text>Lennart Georg Meri (; 29 March 1929 – 14 March 2006) was an Estonian writer, film director, and statesman. He was the country&#x27;s foreign minister from 1990 to 1992 and President of Estonia from 1992 to 2001.

==Early life==
Meri was born in Tallinn, a son of the Estonian diplomat and later Shakespeare translator Georg Meri, and Estonian Swedish mother Alice-Brigitta Engmann. With his family, Lennart left Estonia at an early age and studied abroad, in nine different schools and in four different languages. His warmest memories were from his school years in Lycée Janson de Sailly in Paris. In addition to his native Estonian, Lennart Meri fluently spoke five other languages: Finnish, French, German, English, and Russian.

Lennart Meri and his family lived in Tallinn when Estonia was invaded and occupied by the Stalinist Soviet Union in June 1940. In 1941, the Meri family was deported to Siberia along with thousands of other Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians sharing the same fate. Heads of the family were separated from their families and shut into concentration camps where only a few survived. At the age of twelve, Lennart Meri worked as a lumberman in Siberia. He also worked as a potato peeler and a rafter to support his family.

Whilst in exile, Lennart Meri grew interested in the other Finno-Ugric languages that he heard around him, the language family of which his native Estonian is also a part. His interest in the ethnic and cultural kinship amongst the scattered &quot;Finno-Ugric family&quot; became a lifelong theme within his work.

The Meri family survived and found their way back to Estonia where Lennart Meri graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from the Faculty of History and Languages of the University of Tartu in 1953. On 5 March 1953, the day of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death, he proposed to his first wife Regina Meri, saying &quot;Let us remember this happy day forever.&quot; The politics of the Soviet Union did not allow him to work as a historian, so Meri found work as a dramatist in the Vanemuine, the oldest theatre of Estonia, and later on as a producer of radio plays in the Estonian broadcasting industry. Several of his films were released and have since gained great critical acclaim.

==Writer and filmmaker==

After a trip to the Tian Shan Mountains in Central Asia and the old Islamic centres in the Kara Kum Desert in 1958, Lennart Meri wrote his first book, which met with a warm reception from the public. Already as a student, Lennart Meri had been able to earn his living with his writing, after his father had been arrested by the Soviet authorities for the third time. With the help of his younger brother who had been forced to leave his studies and take a job as a taxi driver, he managed to support their mother and to complete his own studies. The film &quot;The Winds of the Milky Way&quot; (Estonian: &quot;Linnutee tuuled&quot;), shot in co-operation with Finland and Hungary, was banned in the Soviet Union, but won a silver medal at the New York Film Festival. In Finnish schools, his films and texts were used as study materials. In 1986, Lennart Meri was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Helsinki University. He became a member of the Estonian Writers&#x27; Union in 1963. In the 1970s, he was elected an Honorary Member of the Finnish Literary Society.

&quot;Tulemägede Maale&quot;, created in 1964, which is translated as &quot;To the Land of Fiery Mountains&quot;, chronicled Meri&#x27;s journey to the Kamchatka Peninsula in the 1960s. Other members of his expedition group included well known scientists Harry Ling, Kaarel Orviku, Erast Parmasto, Ants Raik, Anto Raukas, Hans Trass, the artist Kaljo Polli, and filmmaker Hans Roosipuu. &quot;Traveling is the only passion that doesn&#x27;t need to feel shy in front of intellect,&quot; wrote Meri. Urban people still have an inner urge to see the world, hunger for nature. Meri did not underestimate the drawbacks of mass tourism but concluded that &quot;science will liberate us from the chains of big cities and lead us back to nature&quot;.

Meri&#x27;s travel book of his journey to the northeast passage, &quot;Virmaliste Väraval&quot; (At the Gate of the Northern Lights) (1974), won him huge success in the Soviet Union. It was translated into Finnish in 1977 in the Soviet Writers series, which also introduced to Finnish readers works by the Estonian writers Mats Traat, Lilli Promet, and Ülo Tuulik. In the book Meri combined the present with a perspective into history, and used material from such explorers as Cook, Forster, Wrangel, Dahl, Sauer, Middendorff, Cochran, and others. When he sees a mountain rising against the stormy sky of the Bering Strait, he realizes that Vitus Bering and James Cook had looked at the same mountain, but from the other side of the strait.

Meri&#x27;s best known work is perhaps &quot;Hõbevalge&quot;, which translates into &quot;Silver White&quot; and was published in 1976. It reconstructs the history of Estonia (largely refuted by modern geneticists) and the Baltic Sea region. As in his other works, Meri combines documentary sources and scientific research with his imagination. &quot;If geography is prose, maps are iconography,&quot; Meri writes. &quot;Hõbevalge&quot; is based on a wide-ranging ancient seafaring sources, and carefully unveils the secret of the legendary Ultima Thule. The name was given in classical times to the most northerly land, reputedly six days&#x27; voyage from Britain. Several alternative places for its location have been suggested, among them the Shetland Islands, Iceland, and Norway. According to Meri, it is possible that Thule derives from the ancient Estonian folk poetry, which depicts the birth of the Kaali crater lake in Saaremaa. In the essay &quot;Tacituse tahtel&quot; (2000), Meri examined ancient contacts between Estonia and the Roman empire and notes that furs, amber, and especially Livonian kiln-dried, disease-free grain may have been Estonia&#x27;s biggest contribution to the common culture of Europe – in lean years, it provided seed grain for Europe.

Meri founded the non-governmental Estonian Institute (&quot;Eesti Instituut&quot;) in 1988 to promote cultural contacts with the West and to send Estonian students to study abroad. He appeared in the documentary film &quot;The Singing Revolution&quot; as an interviewee discussing the collapse of the Soviet regime.

==Political activity==

After more than twenty years of refusals, the Soviet administration finally gave permission for Lennart Meri to travel beyond the Iron Curtain in the late 1970s, and Meri persistently used the opportunities open to him in Finland to remind the Western world of the existence of Estonia. He established close relationships with politicians, journalists and Estonians who had fled from the occupation. He was the first Estonian to publicize abroad the protests against the Soviet plan of mining phosphorite in Estonia (known as the Phosphorite War), which would have rendered a portion of the country uninhabitable.

In Estonia, environmental protests soon grew into a general revolt against Soviet rule: the &quot;Singing Revolution&quot;, which was led by Estonian intellectuals. Meri&#x27;s speech &quot;Do Estonians Have Hope&quot; focused on the existential problems of the nation and had strong repercussions abroad.

In 1988, Meri became a founding member of the Estonian Popular Front, which cooperated with its counterparts in Latvia and Lithuania.

===Foreign minister (1990–1992)===
After the first non-communist-style multi-party election in 1990, Meri was appointed to the post of Foreign Minister. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lennart Meri&#x27;s first task was to create the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He developed around him a group of well educated young people, many English speaking, to establish an open communication channel to the West, and at the same time to represent Estonia more widely on the international scene. He participated in the CSCE Conferences in Copenhagen, New York, Paris, Berlin and Moscow, and the foundation conference of the Council of the Baltic Sea Countries. He also had several meetings with American and European Heads of State and Foreign Ministers, and was the first Eastern European guest to give a presentation at NATO Headquarters in Brussels.

In 1992, Lennart Meri, together with 9 Baltic Ministers of Foreign Affairs and an EU commissioner, founded the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the EuroFaculty.

===First presidential term (1992–1996)===
After a brief period as Ambassador of Estonia to Finland, on 6 October 1992 he became the 2nd President of Estonia, and the first since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Meri was the candidate of the Pro Patria Union. For the only time since the restoration of independence, the election had a popular vote component. Arnold Rüütel, a former leading communist and chairman of the Supreme Council (as the Estonian Supreme Soviet had been renamed following independence), led the field with 42 per cent to Meri&#x27;s 29 percent. With no candidate receiving a majority, the election was decided in the newly elected Riigikogu, which was dominated by the Pro Patria Alliance. During the campaign, some of his opponents tried to bring up questions about Meri&#x27;s alleged former links with the KGB. However, these allegations did not harm Meri&#x27;s reputation and public image. Lennart Meri was sworn in as the President on 6 October 1992.

Meri made public remarks against the Karaganov Doctrine on 25 February 1994 in a festival speech to the good Hamburgers, who descended from the trade barons of the Hanseatic League. Karaganov generated his doctrine in about 1992, and it states that Moscow should pose as the defender of human rights of ethnic Russians living in the &#x27;near abroad&#x27; for the purpose of gaining political influence in these regions. Already in 1992 this idea was brought into Russian Federation politics by Boris Yeltsin.

In 1994, the Estonian Newspaper Association declared Meri the Year&#x27;s Press Friend. This was the first time this award was given; since that, it has been a yearly occurrence. In 1998, Meri was given the complementary award and titled the Year&#x27;s Press Friend.

===Second presidential term (1996–2001)===
On 20 September 1996, he was re-elected for a second and final term.

In 1999, Meri was once again given the Press Friend award.

He was a member of Club of Madrid.

==Work for German refugees and for other victims of ethnic cleansing==
Lennart Meri was engaged in the work for the human rights of German refugees from Central and Eastern Europe and other victims of ethnic cleansing in Europe, and was a member of the jury of the Franz Werfel Human Rights Award, which was awarded by the Centre Against Expulsions (). In 1999 he received the highest distinction of the Federation of Expellees ().

==Personal life==
Meri was married twice. His second wife Helle Meri (1949−2024) worked as an actress in the Estonian Drama Theatre until 1992. Lennart Meri&#x27;s first wife Regina Meri (1932−2020) emigrated to Canada in 1987. Lennart Meri was survived by three children: sons Mart Meri (born in 1959) and Kristjan Meri (1966–2022) and daughter Tuule Meri (born in 1985), and five grandchildren.

His first cousin was the Estonian Soviet soldier Arnold Meri, who spent the last 2 years of his life on trial under charges of genocide for his involvement in deportations of Estonians, but died in 2009 before a verdict was given.

Meri was chosen the European of the Year in 1998 by French newspaper &quot;La Vie&quot;.

==Death==

Diagnosed with a brain tumor in mid-2005 after experiencing strong headaches, Meri underwent surgery in August. The tumor was found to be malignant and he died on the morning of 14 March 2006, fifteen days before his 77th birthday, after being hospitalized in Tallinn for months. In a televised national speech, his successor, President Arnold Rüütel, said, &quot;In his nine years as head of state, Meri both restored the presidency and built up the Republic of Estonia in the widest sense.&quot; Finnish President Tarja Halonen stated, &quot;The Finnish nation lost in Lennart Meri a close and sincere friend and the world, a great statesman who was one of the leading architects of the post-Cold War world.&quot; Latvian President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga said, &quot;the world has lost a great Estonian, a great statesman and a true European.&quot;

Meri&#x27;s funeral was attended by former Swedish premier Carl Bildt, among other figures. He was buried at Forest Cemetery in the Tallinn district of Pirita.

==Legacy==

<text>The music of [[Iceland]] includes folk and pop traditions, as well as an active classical and contemporary music scene. Well-known artists from Iceland include medieval music group Voces Thules, alternative pop band The Sugarcubes, singers Björk, Laufey, Daði Freyr, Hafdís Huld and Emiliana Torrini, post-rock band Sigur Rós and Múm, post-metal band Sólstafir, indie folk/indie pop band Of Monsters and Men, blues/rock band Kaleo, metal band Skálmöld and techno-industrial band Hatari. Iceland&#x27;s traditional music is related to Nordic music forms. Although Iceland has a very small population, it is home to many famous and praised bands and musicians.

==Folk music==
Icelandic music has a relatively long tradition, with some songs still sung today dating from 14th century. Folk songs are often about love, sailors, masculinity, hard winters, as well as elves, trolls and other mythological creatures, and tend to be quite secular and often humorous. Bjarni Þorsteinsson collected Icelandic folk music between 1906 and 1909, and many of the songs he encountered were accompanied by traditional instruments like the langspil and fiðla, which are among the few musical instruments traditionally played in Iceland. Chain dances, known as vikivaki, have been performed in Iceland since the 11th century at a variety of occasions, such as in churches and during the Christmas season. An example is &quot;Ólafur Liljurós&quot;, an Icelandic vikivaki folk song dating to the 14th century, about a man who, while on his way to meet his mother, is seduced, kissed, and stabbed by an elf woman while riding his horse, then eventually dies.

Iceland&#x27;s isolation meant that, until the 18th century, foreign influences were almost completely absent, which resulted in the maintenance of a particular rhythm, called &quot;hákveða&quot;, lost in other Nordic countries and considered one of the main characteristics of Icelandic folk music. Hákveða refers to a special emphasis placed on some of the words of a song, often the last word of each sentence in each verse. In the following example, taken from the song &quot;Ólafur Liljurós&quot;, hákveða is shown in italics:

:Ólafur reið með björgunum fram, villir &quot;Hann&quot;, stillir &quot;&quot;Hann&quot;,
:hitti hann fyrir sér &quot;álfarann&quot;, þar rauði loginn &quot;brann&quot;,
:Blíðan lagði byrinn undan &quot;björgunum&quot;, blíðan lagði byrinn undan &quot;björgunum&quot; fram.

&quot;Rímur&quot; are epic tales sung as alliterative, rhyming ballads, usually a cappella. &quot;Rímur&quot; can be traced back to the Viking Age Eddic poetry of the skalds and employs complex metaphors and cryptic rhymes and forms. Some of the most famous &quot;rímur&quot; were written between the 18th and early 20th centuries, by poets like Hannes Bjarnason (1776–1838), Jón Sigurðsson (1853–1922) and Sigurður Breiðfjörð (1798–1846).

In the early 18th century, European dances like polka, waltz, reel and schottische begin to arrive via Denmark. These foreign dances are today known as &quot;gömlu dansarnir&quot; or literally the &quot;old dances&quot;. After their arrival, native dance and song traditions fell into serious decline. For a long time, &quot;rímur&quot; were officially banned by the church. Paradoxically, many Icelandic priests were keen in making &quot;rímur&quot;. &quot;Rímur&quot; remained popular recreation until the early 20th century. In recent years, efforts have been made to revive native Icelandic forms. For example, a modern revitalization of the &quot;Rímur&quot; tradition began in 1929 with the formation of the organization Iðunn.

Protestantism has also left its mark on the music of Iceland. Hallgrímur Pétursson wrote numerous Protestant hymns in the 17th century. In the 19th century, Magnús Stephensen brought pipe organs to Iceland, soon to be followed by harmonium pumped reed-organs. &quot;Heyr himna smiður&quot; (&quot;Hark, Creator of the Heaven&quot;) is probably the oldest hymn which is still sung today; the text was composed by Kolbeinn Tumason in 1208 but the music is much more recent, was written by Þorkell Sigurbjörnsson in 1973.

== Popular music ==
The music of Iceland includes vibrant folk and pop traditions and is expanding in its variety of sound styles and genres. Well-known artists from Iceland include alternative rock band The Sugarcubes, singers Björk, Hafdís Huld and Emilíana Torrini, and post-rock band Sigur Rós, as well as electronic music groups like GusGus. Iceland&#x27;s traditional music is related to Nordic music forms.

Icelandic popular music today includes many bands and artists, ranging from indie and pop-rock to electronic music. It is also increasingly becoming recognized for its vibrant and growing metal and hardcore scene.

One widely known Icelandic artist is eclectic singer and composer Björk, who has received 15 Grammy nominations and sold over 15 million albums worldwide, including two platinum albums and one gold album in the United States. Another is the post-rock formation Sigur Rós and its lead singer Jónsi. Widely known outside Iceland, they were immortalized in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and more recently in an episode of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

==Popular artists==

===Indie and pop-rock===
According to the Icelandic label Record Records, the indie pop-folk group Of Monsters and Men is Iceland&#x27;s biggest act since Björk and Sigur Rós. Their debut album &quot;My Head Is an Animal&quot;, as well as their first single &quot;Little Talks&quot;, reached high positions in single and album charts worldwide. In 2013 they won the European Border Breakers Awards. Singer-songwriter Ásgeir Trausti did likewise in 2014, and ever since has been successfully touring Europe and the U.S. with his melodic-folk-pop songs, which he sings both in his native language Icelandic and in English. The singer-songwriter Emiliana Torrini is an established Icelandic artist who had a base in the UK for many years. Her song &quot;Jungle Drum&quot;, from her 2008 album &quot;Me and Armini&quot;, is internationally known and reached number one in the German, Austrian, Belgium and Icelandic single charts. Her album &quot;Tookah&quot;, released in 2013, reached the Top 50 album charts in several countries.

Other artists that are attracting attention outside Iceland include the electro-pop group FM Belfast, indie pop / rock / folk band Kaleo as well as the singers and composers Sóley and Sin Fang, who are both known as founding members of the band Seabear.

===Alternative and metal===
The alternative and metal scene is vibrant with Icelandic bands playing large festivals in Europe and the United States. The metal-band Sólstafir is widely known outside Iceland. Already back in 1999 they had a contract for their debut album with a German record label. The Viking-Metal Band Skálmöld played two sold out shows with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra in the capital&#x27;s concert hall Harpa in December 2013. Agent Fresco combine metal, rock and alternative elements with the unique voice of singer Arnór Dan Arnarson and have also gained international attention. The instrumental post-rock and alternative-rock band For a Minor Reflection is widely known since supported Sigur Rós on tour back in 2009. Their sound is often compared to Explosions in the Sky or the Scottish post-rock band Mogwai. Dead Skeletons are not only known for their unique psychedelic-rock sound but also for their artwork and an art gallery in Reykjavik run by front man and singer Jón Sæmundur Auðarson. The Vintage Caravan, founded by two of the members in 2006 when they were only 12 years old, have played festivals in Europe, including the Wacken Open Air and toured with bigger bands like Europe and Opeth.

Iceland also has a thriving extreme metal scene which is gaining recognition abroad. The black metal band Svartidauði are widely considered a central figure in the development of the Icelandic black metal scene. Many of the scene&#x27;s most significant albums were recorded and produced at Studio Emissary, a recording studio set up by Irish musician Stephen Lockhart, and the cassette label Vánagandr has also had a significant role in the development of the country&#x27;s black metal scene. In 2016, the music festival Oration MMXVI debuted as Iceland&#x27;s first black metal festival, and subsequently returned for two final instalments in 2017 and 2018. In 2016, black metal band Misþyrming were selected as one of Roadburn Festival&#x27;s artists in residence.

===Electronic music===
The techno house group GusGus is one of Iceland&#x27;s most successful exports in the field of electronic music. So far they released nine studio albums. The latest &quot;Lies Are More Flexible&quot; came out in February 2018.

Other artists include DJ duo Gluteus Maximus, Hermigervill, Bloodgroup and Sísý Ey.

The international franchise Sónar held their first festival in Reykjavik in 2013 with a long roster of international and local electronic acts.

===Experimental===
Ben Frost, born in Melbourne, living in Reykjavik, is bringing together electronic soundscapes with classical elements and noisy tunes. His latest album, &quot;Aurora&quot;, was released in June 2014.

Classical elements also characterize the symphonic music of composer and singer Ólafur Arnalds. Other widely known experimental bands are Múm and the high school originated Hjaltalín.

The trio Samaris have gained attention, especially in Europe, and have played festivals all over Europe. Their self-released EP, &quot;Stofnar falla&quot;, received positive reviews and was followed by their self-titled debut album, released in July 2013.

Mengi in Reykjavik is a centre for avant garde music, experimental music and contemporary music. The organisation organizes performances, exhibitions, conferences and runs a recording studio and a record label.

===Classical music===
Plainchant and Polyphonic Singing in the Middle Ages and Renaissance

With the Christianization of Iceland ca. 1000 came music traditionally associated with the Roman Catholic church. Plainchant was sung daily in churches, and later also in monasteries and nunneries. This was in accordance with the rite of the archbishopric of Nidaros (Trondheim) in Norway. A significant work of Icelandic origin is &quot;Þorlákstíðir&quot;, the office for Saint Thorlákur, which survives in a music manuscript from ca. 1400. Most of the manuscripts containing this music were destroyed after the Reformation, and only survive in fragments. Many of them were later used for book-binding and were removed from the binding in the early 20th century; these fragments are now found in archives in Reykjavík and Copenhagen.

Plainchant was also sometimes sung in two parts, called &quot;tvísöngur&quot; in Icelandic. This tradition goes back to at least the early 13th century, since the Bishop Lárentíus Kálfsson tried to ban it ca. 1220, wanting instead that singers would sing only &quot;what was written in the choirbooks.&quot; Despite this, &quot;tvísöngur&quot; is found in manuscripts from the 15th-18th centuries and was a significant performing tradition, both in sacred and secular contexts. Other polyphonic music was introduced in the 16th century, presumably by the schoolmaster Erasmus Villatsson, who is said to have introduced &quot;discantus&quot; or four-part music, to students at the Latin school at Skálholt in the 1560s. In recent years, the origins of these works have been traced to well-known songs from continental Europe, such as the famous Susanne un jour by Didier Lupi, which in Icelandic was sung as &quot;Súsanna, sannan Guðs dóm.&quot; Also, the song &quot;Vera mátt góður,&quot; found in the 17th-century manuscript Melódía (Rask 98, now in the Arnamagnæan collection in Copenhagen) is ultimately derived from a song by the Florentine composer Francesco Corteccia, &quot;Ecce bonum licet&quot;. 

====Composition====
Aside from the traditions mentioned above, classical music came to Iceland comparatively late, with the first Iceland composers working in the western, classical tradition emerging in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Among them was Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson, who is considered to have been the first Icelandic professional composer. Among his contributions to Icelandic music is the national anthem, Lofsöngur. Belonging to this first generation of Icelandic composers were Sigvaldi Kaldalóns and Sigfús Einarsson, and Emil Thoroddsen, best known for their songs with piano accompaniment. The most significant Icelandic composer in the first half of the 20th century was Jón Leifs who studied and worked in Germany until 1944 when he fled Nazi Germany to Norway and later Iceland where he became a considerable force in Icelandic musical life. A female composer from the same period, who also studied in Germany and fled the Nazis at the beginning of the war was Jórunn Viðar. 

Today, Iceland has a vibrant classical music scene, with numerous composers of contemporary music achieving international success. These include Haukur Tómasson, Anna Thorvaldsdottir, Daníel Bjarnason, Jóhann Jóhannsson and Hugi Gudmundsson.

====Performance====
The first proper orchestral concert in Iceland was held in 1921, in conjunction with the royal visit of Christian X of Denmark, the reigning monarch of Iceland. The ensemble created for the occasion was given the name Hljómsveit Reykjavíkur (The Reykjavík Orchestra), and performed sporadically in the years that followed under the direction of Sigfús Einarsson and Páll Ísólfsson. Following the founding of the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service in 1930, and the festivities at the 1000th anniversary of the Alþingi, and through the pioneering work of musicians like Franz Mixa, Victor Urbancic and Róbert A. Ottósson, this ensemble was slowly transformed into the professional symphony orchestra known today as the Iceland Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra resides in Harpa, Reykjavík&#x27;s largest concert house, and holds weekly concerts in its Eldborg hall.

Additionally, a number of musical ensembles regularly perform in Reykjavík, playing music that ranges from Baroque to contemporary music. These include Reykjavík Chamber Orchestra, CAPUT ensemble and Nordic Affect. Several classic music festivals are held in Reykjavík and all around Iceland annually, including Dark Music Days and Reykjavík Midsummer Music.

Icelandic classical instrumentalists have achieved success internationally. Undoubtedly, the most famous Icelandic citizen within the world of classical music is the Russian pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy, who settled in Iceland with his Icelandic wife Þórunn Jóhannsdóttir in 1968, following their defection from the Soviet Union. He was awarded Icelandic citizenship in 1972. Other notable, Icelandic classical instrumentalists with international careers include Sigurbjörn Bernharðsson, violinist and member of the Pacifica Quartet, Elfa Rún Kristinsdóttir, violinist, Víkingur Ólafsson, pianist, and the cellist Sæunn Thorsteinsdóttir.

<text>Camisards were Huguenots (French Protestants) of the rugged and isolated Cévennes region and the neighbouring Vaunage in southern France. In the early 1700s, they raised a resistance against the persecutions which followed Louis XIV&#x27;s Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, making Protestantism illegal. The Camisards operated throughout the mainly Protestant Cévennes and Vaunage regions including parts of the Camargue around Aigues Mortes. The revolt broke out in 1702, with the worst of the fighting continuing until 1704, then skirmishes until 1710 and a final peace by 1715. The Edict of Tolerance was not finally signed until 1787.

==Etymology==
The name in the Occitan language may derive from a type of linen smock or shirt known as a &quot;camisa&quot; (chemise) that peasants wear in lieu of any sort of uniform. Alternatively, it might come from the , meaning paths (chemins). , in the sense of &quot;night attack&quot;, is derived from a feature of their tactics.

==History==

In April 1598, Henry IV had signed the Edict of Nantes and the religious wars that had ravaged France ended. Protestants had been given limited civic rights and the liberty to worship according to their convictions. This &quot;fundamental and irrevocable law&quot; was maintained by Henry&#x27;s son, Louis XIII. In October 1685, Henry&#x27;s grandson, Louis XIV (The Sun king), revoked the Edict of Nantes, issuing his own Edict of Fontainebleau. Louis was determined to impose a single religion on France: that of Rome. As early as 1681 he instituted the dragonnades which were conversions enforced by dragoons, labelled &quot;missionaries in boots&quot;. They were billeted in the homes of Protestants to help them decide to convert back to the official church or alternatively to emigrate. The Cévennes was a centre of resistance, and the policy did not work.

The Edict of Fontainebleau removed all rights and protections from the Huguenots. There followed about twenty years of persecutions. Reformed worship and private Bible readings were outlawed. Within weeks of the new edict over 2000 Protestant churches were burned, under the direction of Nicholas Lamoignon de Basville, the royal administrator of Languedoc, and entire villages were massacred and burnt to the ground in a series of stunning atrocities. The pastors and worshippers were captured and later exiled, sent to the galleys, tortured or killed. Seventy-five missionary priests under the command of Abbot François Langlade were sent to the Cévennes. Soldiers carrying crosses on their muskets forced the peasants to sign papers to say they were converting, and forced them to attend mass. The peasants continued to attend illicit meetings. Huguenots with a trade fled to neighboring countries. The King responded by closing the borders.

The Protestant peasants of the Vaunage and the Cévennes, led by a number of teachers known as &quot;prophets&quot;, notably François Vivent and Claude Brousson, resisted. Vivent encouraged his followers to arm themselves in case they were set upon by Royalist soldiers. Several leading prophets were tortured and executed, François Vivent in 1692 and Claude Brousson in 1698. Many more were exiled, leaving the abandoned congregations to the leadership of less educated and more mystically oriented preachers, such as the wool-comber Abraham Mazel. The Catholic church was likened to the Beast of the Apocalypse and the clandestine prophets claimed to have seen it in the prophetic dreams. Mazel, in a dream, saw black oxen in his garden and heard a voice telling him to chase them away. From 1700 the clandestine prophets and their armed followers were hidden in houses and caves in the mountains.


===Abraham Mazel===
Open hostilities began on 24 July 1702, with the assassination at le Pont-de-Montvert of a local embodiment of royal oppression, François Langlade, the Abbé of Chaila. Langlade had recently arrested and tortured a group of seven Protestants accused of attempting to flee France. The band of Camisards were led by Abraham Mazel, who peacefully asked for the release of the prisoners, but when this was refused, they commenced the killing. The abbé was quickly lionized in print by the Catholic State as a martyr of his faith.

The Camisards worked independently of each other and during the day most merged back into their village communities. They were predominantly agricultural workers or artisans and had no aristocratic leaders. They knew the paths and the sheep tracks intimately. They called themselves the Children of God – they were inspired by religion, not by patronage or politics.

===Jean Cavalier===
Led by the young Jean Cavalier and Pierre Laporte (Rolland), the Camisards met the ravages of the royal army with irregular warfare methods and withstood superior forces in several pitched battles.

Violence increased as atrocities were committed on both sides: massacres in Catholic villages such as Fraissinet-de-Fourques, Valsauve and Potelières by camisards. Basville, a government administrator with a reputation founded on torture, deported the entire populations of Mialet and Saumane. Then in the autumn of 1703, with the king&#x27;s consent, the systematic &quot;Burning of the Cévennes&quot; destroyed 466 hamlets and exiled their populations.

Other Protestants, like those of Fraissinet-de-Lozère, under the influence of village elites, chose a loyalist attitude and fought the Camisards. They were nevertheless equally victims, losing their homes during the &quot;Burning of the Cévennes&quot;.

White Camisards, also known as &quot;Cadets of the Cross&quot; (&quot;Cadets de la Croix&quot;, from a small white cross which they wore on their coats), were Catholics from neighboring communities such as St. Florent, Senechas and Rousson who, on seeing their old enemies on the run, organized into companies to loot and to hunt the rebels down. They committed atrocities, such as killing 52 people at the village of Brenoux, including pregnant women and children.

Other opponents of the Protestants included six hundred miquelet marksmen from Roussillon hired as mercenaries by the King.

In 1704, Claude Louis Hector de Villars, the royal commander, offered vague concessions to the Protestants and the promise to Cavalier of a command in the royal army. Cavalier&#x27;s acceptance of the offer broke the revolt, although others, including Laporte, refused to submit unless the Edict of Nantes was restored. Scattered fighting went on until 1710, but the true end of the uprising was the arrival in the Cévennes of the Protestant minister Antoine Court and the reestablishment of a small Protestant community that was largely left in peace, especially after the death of Louis XIV in 1715.

==The people==
Of the Camisards, 42% were Cévennes peasants, and 58% were rural craftsmen, of whom 75% worked as wool-combers, wool-carders and weavers. All spoke Occitan. There were no noblemen involved, none had been trained in the art of war. There was no concept of a single army, there was no single leader but every region had its permanent organisers and occasional soldiers.

The leaders of note were:

* Gédéon Laporte
* Salomon Couderc with Abraham Mazel in Le Bougès and Mont Lozère.
* Henri Castanet (1674–1705) in charge of Mont Aigoual.
* Pierre Laporte (Rolland) (1680–1704) in the Basses-Cévennes, Mialet and Lassalle. 
* Jean Cavalier (1681–1704) in the plains of Bas-Languedoc between Uzès and Sauve.

Religiously, ordained pastors were rounded up, and a series of prophets ministered secretly. Notable among them were:

* Esprit Séguier
* Abraham Mazel
* Elie Marion
* Jean Cavalier

The visions of the prophets inspired the operations of the war, and encouraged the peasants to feel invincible. The peasants marched singing Psalms — which unnerved the opposition.

== Heritage ==
Jean Cavalier later went over to the British, who made him governor of the island of Jersey.

A millenarian group of ex-Camisards under the guidance of Elie Marion emigrated to London in 1706, and were said to have links with the Alumbrados. They were generally treated with scorn and some official repression as the &quot;French Prophets&quot;. Their example and their writings had some influence later, both on the spiritual outlook of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and on Ann Lee, founder of the Shaker movement.

=== Role in the survival of Protestantism in France ===
After the main active Camisard groups had been subdued in various ways, the French authorities were keen not to re-ignite the revolt and took a more moderate approach to anti-Protestant repression. Many former Camisards came back to a more peaceful approach and from 1715 onwards helped re-establish a still illegal but now much better organised Protestantism. They were under the leadership of Antoine Court and of the numerous travelling pastors who were permitted to re-enter the country.

=== &quot;The Camisards&#x27; legend&quot; ===
In his book with the title &quot;La légende des Camisards&quot;, Philippe Joutard, a professor of history, registered the very lively oral tradition about the Camisards which has prevailed to this day in the Cévennes region. He also observed the &quot;attractive power&quot; of this striking period of history where many unrelated episodes have been integrated through the oral tradition. As this oral transmission is mainly done through the families, it often highlights more of their own ancestors who were faithful to their convictions than the heroic leaders of the revolt. In so doing it develops beyond the original religious question to a general attitude of resistance and non-conformity which determines a whole philosophical, political and human culture and way of life. Philippe Joutard also noted that even the minority of Catholics living in this Protestant part of the country tend to reconstruct their history in the same way as their former religious opponents. The footprint of the Camisards in Cévennes is thus particularly deep and lasting.

<text>USS &quot;Vandegrift&quot; (FFG-48) was an of the United States Navy. The ship was named for General Alexander A. Vandegrift (1887–1973), 18th Commandant of the Marine Corps.

&quot;Vandegrift&quot; was laid down on 13 October 1981 at Todd Pacific Shipyards, Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 15 October 1982 – cosponsored by Ms. Courtney A. Vandegrift, Ms. Stephanie S. Vandegrift, and Ms. Daphne L. Vandegrift, three of the late Gen. Vandegrift’s granddaughters, and Ms. Serina N. S. Vandegrift, his great granddaughter. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; was commissioned on 24 November 1984 and, after over 30 years of service, decommissioned on 19 February 2015.

== 1980s ==

The ship&#x27;s inaugural cruise began on 5 January 1987. During the course of this around-the-world cruise, she sailed three oceans, seven seas and visited four continents. The plank owners also crossed the International Date Line, Equator, Greenwich Meridian, and sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar, and the Suez and Panama Canals. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; conducted operations with in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. These operations were highlighted by an air and sea power demonstration for president Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan. Port visits included Pearl Harbor; Subic Bay in the Republic of the Philippines; Karachi, Pakistan; Mombasa, Kenya; Maxime, France; Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; and St. Croix and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; returned home to Long Beach in June 1987.

The ship&#x27;s second deployment began in June 1988, returning her to operations in the Persian Gulf shortly after the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. &quot;Vandegrift&quot;&#x27;s mission while on patrol in the northern Persian Gulf focused on providing protection and logistic support for joint forces in the area. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; also participated in numerous Earnest Will missions, escorting U.S. and reflagged Kuwaiti tankers. Port visits included Pearl Harbor; Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines; Bahrain; Pattaya Beach, Thailand and Hong Kong. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; returned home in December 1988.

== 1990s ==

The ship&#x27;s third deployment to the Persian Gulf began in March 1990. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; patrolled the Northern Persian Gulf and conducted Earnest Will escort missions. As the senior ship on station in the Persian Gulf during the invasion of Kuwait, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; served as the Anti-Air Warfare Commander and Electronic Warfare Coordinator. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; participated in Operation Desert Shield&#x27;s Maritime Interception Operations with units from United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and France. Ports of call included Pearl Harbor; Subic Bay; Phuket, Thailand; Singapore and Hong Kong. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; returned home after an extended deployment in October 1990.

On 22 April 1992, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; began her fourth deployment to the Persian Gulf. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; participated in exercises with India, Qatar and Pakistan,
helping to strengthen U.S. relations in that area. Ports of call included Doha, Qatar; Dubai, Jebel Ali and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Karachi, Pakistan; Phuket, Thailand; Goa, India; Bahrain; Hong Kong; Singapore and Guam, and earned the Chief of Naval Operations LAMPS Helicopter Safety Award. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; returned home on 22 October 1992.

From 1 January to 3 February 1993, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; was homeported in Long Beach, CA. Due to extensive shipyard time and the closing of Naval Station Long Beach, from 3 February 1993, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; was homeported in San Diego, CA. From 1 January to 2 April, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; was commanded by Commander Theodore L. Kaye. From 2 April to 31 December, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; was commanded by Commander David C. Harrison. From 1 January to 31 July, Vandegrift was under the administrative command of Commander, Destroyer Squadron 9. From 31 July to 31 December, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; was under the administrative command of Commander, Destroyer Squadron 33.

The ship earned the COMNAVSURFPAC Food Service Award in March 1994. The fifth deployment to the Persian Gulf began on 25 October 1994. &quot;Vandegrift&quot;&#x27;s mission was the enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq in the Northern Persian Gulf. The most memorable event was conducting a non-permissive boarding of a sanctions violator on 25 December. During the return transit, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; played host to a major diplomatic reception in Muscat, Oman, to better diplomatic relations. Ports of call included Sasebo, Japan; Manila, Republic of the Philippines; Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates; Bahrain; Singapore and Hong Kong. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; returned home on 25 April 1995.

In 1998, the ship shifted homeports to Yokosuka, Japan. Between 1998 and 2000, the ship performed numerous cruises to South Korea, Thailand, China, Singapore, the Marianas Islands, Australia, and conducted a RIMPAC deployment to Hawaii in company with the Japanese Navy. In 1999, the vessel was visited by Admiral Jay L. Johnson, then Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).

== 2000s ==
In January 2003, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; deployed for the eighth time to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom. Assigned escort operations in the Straits of Hormuz, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; conducted over 180 transits, safely escorting over 78 vessels carrying over 1 million tons of hardware in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Additionally, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; seized two Iraqi mine-laying vessels in the Southern Persian Gulf and was credited with protecting the Coalition’s flank from planned mine-laying operations.

On 19 November 2003, the frigate became the first US warship to enter Vietnamese waters since April 1975.

The ship&#x27;s decorations include the Meritorious Unit Commendation, National Defense Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal; Southwest Asia Service Medal, and five Sea Service Ribbons.

As of 2006, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; was based in San Diego, California.

== 2010s ==

In March 2014, Eric and Charlotte Kauffman, and their daughters, three-year-old Cora and one-year-old Lyra, set sail from San Diego, California, to circumnavigate the globe in their 36-foot sailboat, &quot;Rebel Heart&quot;. Lyra fell sick, however, and on 3 April the family sent a distress call, from a position hundreds of miles off the Mexican coast. A Lockheed MC-130P Combat Shadow of the California Air National Guard’s 130th Rescue Squadron, 129th Rescue Wing, flew out to the area and four pararescuemen jumped into the water, climbed on board the sailboat and medically treated and stabilized Lyra. &quot;Vandegrift&quot; reached the area on 5 April, and at about 0800 the following morning, she lowered a team in a rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB), and the sailors brought the family and the pararescuemen on board the frigate. The rescuers provided the Kauffmans with food, water, and medical assistance, but instructed the castaways that because of the limited room on board the RHIB and ship, they could only retrieve three bags of their personal belongings in a single trip before &quot;Vandegrift&quot; sank &quot;Rebel Heart&quot; as a hazard to navigation. Some of the Kauffmans&#x27; neighbors in the San Diego area therefore raised funds and donated goods to help the family recover from their ordeal when they returned ashore.

From 1 May to 28 November 2012 &quot;Vandegrift &quot;participated in a CARAT deployment, visiting Russia, Japan, Cambodia, Malaysia, and other Pacific nations.

&quot;Vandegrift&quot; returned from its final deployment on 12 December 2014, where she operated in the U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command/U.S. 4th Fleet area of responsibility (AOR). During this final deployment, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; was part of the counter-transnational organized crime (C-TOC) mission Operation Martillo, a joint, combined operation involving the U.S. and 14 European and Western Hemisphere partner nations, that targets illicit trafficking routes in the waters off Central America. While participating in Operation Martillo, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; intercepted approximately 8,996 kg of cocaine. The ship also participated in three community relations (COMREL) projects in Panama City during which 36 sailors helped build a workshop for the blind, assist an outreach group in refurbishing their building and spent time with children in the Aid for AIDS community.

After returning from her last deployment, the crew began to make preparations for decommissioning. After over 30 years of service, &quot;Vandegrift&quot; was decommissioned on 19 February 2015 at Naval Base San Diego.

She was sunk as a target in a SINKEX as a part of the Valiant Shield 2022 training exercise.

<text>DeadAIM (originally De-Ad AIM) was a program created by James Dennis to add new features such as tabbed conversations (which ended up being available in standard AIM until its shutdown) and to disable the advertising in AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). The last release of DeadAIM was version 4.5 in 2003. 

In mid-2003, the rights to DeadAIM were sold to America Online effectively ending the development of the program.

JDennis was able to modify the framework of AIM with the use of API hooking. DeadAIM used an OCM file, similar to a DLL, to load into AIM. JDennis had benefited greatly by creating somewhat of a partnership with AOL. This allowed him to add several features more easily and also allowed him to create DeadAIMRegIn, an official AOL bot, to confirm registration information and prevent software piracy.

<doc id="379553" wikidata="Q2176276" url="?curid=379553" title="Photoshop contest">
<text>A Photoshop contest, or sometimes Photoshop battle (often abbreviated to PS Battle), is an online game, in which a website or user of an Internet forum will post a starting image — usually a photograph — and ask others to manipulate the image using some graphics editing software, usually Adobe Photoshop, however other editors are commonly allowed, such as Corel Photo-Paint, GIMP, PaintShop Pro, Paint.NET or even Microsoft Paint. People can also use video editing software to create these images, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Kdenlive, OpenShot, or NCH VideoPad.

While Photoshop is the industry standard image editing program, Adobe Systems, the publisher of Photoshop, discourages use of &quot;Photoshop&quot; to refer to anything other than their photo editing software, to prevent their trademark from becoming generic.

==Humor==

A large part of the humor in many of these contests involves the use of internet memes.

Such contests have recently seen increasing participation on many blogs and forums. The popular internet community Reddit has a community called r/photoshopbattles devoted to the contests.

A more &quot;underground&quot; variety of these image manipulation jokes involves the blending of celebrity faces with nude or pornographic images commonly known as fake nudes, often combined with references to movies, music, magazines and other forms of related popular culture.

==Photoshop tennis==
Photoshop tennis (also known as Photoshop Pong or Photoshop battle (similar in its function to a &quot;DJ battle&quot; or &quot;rap battle&quot; in hip hop music) is a game played through sequential alternating (photoshopping) of an image. Photoshop tennis originated in graphics-related internet forums in the late-1990s/early-2000s, and shares an earlier history with online image games such as SITO&#x27;s &quot;PANIC&quot; (started January, 1994). The game was made popular by art director Jim Coudal in 2001 as &quot;Photoshop Tennis&quot;. The matches on coudal.com were later renamed Layer Tennis after enabling the use of other software, and continued through four seasons of competition.

Each match tennis is generally played with two competing players. The players pick a starting image, or one is &quot;served&quot; by a player, then another player makes some sort of alteration to the image in any chosen image editor (matches are not exclusive to Adobe Photoshop). They then send the altered image to the other player or players, usually via e-mail or by posting the image to a Photoshop tennis forum, who then edits that image and sends it back to the first player. This process goes back and forth until a predetermined number of rounds have elapsed, or the players otherwise wish to end the game. When the final round is over, there may be an independent judge who determines who has played the best shots, and declares that person the winner, or players may play without a clear winner. Sometimes extra rules can be enforced, such as sticking to one particular software package, or keeping to a particular theme.

<doc id="379555" wikidata="Q928652" url="?curid=379555" title="Estonian Centre Party">
<text>The Estonian Centre Party (, EK) is a populist political party in Estonia. It was founded in 1991 as a direct successor of the Popular Front of Estonia, and it is currently led by Mihhail Kõlvart.

The party was founded on 12 October 1991 from the basis of the Popular Front of Estonia after several parties split from it. At that time, the party was called the People&#x27;s Centre Party (&quot;Rahvakeskerakond&quot;) to differentiate from the smaller centre-right Rural Centre Party (&quot;Maa-Keskerakond&quot;). The party was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe until 14 September 2024.

==History==

In the parliamentary elections of March 1995, the Centre Party was placed third with 14.2% of votes and 16 seats. It entered the coalition, Edgar Savisaar taking the position of the Minister of Internal Affairs, and four other ministerial positions (Social Affairs, Economy, Education and Transportation &amp; Communications). After the &quot;tape scandal&quot; (secret taping of talks with other politicians) in which Savisaar was involved, the party was forced to go to opposition. A new party was formed by those who were disappointed by their leader&#x27;s behaviour. Savisaar became the Chairman of the City Council of the capital city Tallinn. In 1996, Siiri Oviir ran for the presidency of Estonia. In the parliamentary elections of March 1999, the Centre Party, whose main slogan was progressive income tax, gained 23.4% of votes (the first result) and 28 seats in the Riigikogu. Party members are active in its 26 branches – eight of them are active in Tallinn, 18 in towns and counties. The Centre Party became a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (then known as the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party) at the organisation&#x27;s July 2003 London Congress. The party also applied for the membership of the Liberal International (LI) in 2001, but the LI decided to reject the party&#x27;s application in August 2001, as Savisaar&#x27;s conduct was adjudged to &quot;not always conform to liberal principles&quot;.

In 2001, Kreitzberg unsuccessfully ran for the presidency of Estonia. Savisaar was the Mayor of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, from 2001 to fall 2004, when he was forced to step down after a vote of no confidence. He was replaced by Tõnis Palts of Res Publica. In January 2002, the Centre Party and the Estonian Reform Party formed a new governmental coalition where Centre Party got 8 ministerial seats (Minister of Defense, Education, Social Affairs, Finances, Economy &amp; Communications, Interior, Agriculture and Minister of integration and national minorities). The coalition stayed until the new elections in 2003, in which the party won 28 seats. Though the Centre Party won the greatest per cent of votes, it was in opposition until March 2005 when Juhan Parts&#x27; government collapsed. In 2003, the majority of the party&#x27;s assembly did not support Estonia&#x27;s joining the European Union (EU). Savisaar did not express clearly his position. A number of Centre Party members exited the party in autumn 2004, mostly due to objections with Savisaar&#x27;s autocratic tendencies and the party&#x27;s EU-sceptic stance, forming the Social Liberal group. Some of them joined the Social Democratic Party, others the Reform Party and others the People&#x27;s Party. One of these MPs later rejoined the Centre Party. Since Estonia&#x27;s accession to the EU, the party has largely revised its formerly EU-sceptic positions.

In 2004, the Centre Party gained one member in the European Parliament – Siiri Oviir. The Centre Party gathered 17.5% share of votes on the elections to the European Parliament. Oviir joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Group. The Centre Party participated in government with the Estonian Reform Party and the People&#x27;s Union of Estonia from 12 April 2005 until a new government took office after the March 2007 elections. The Centre Party had five minister portfolios (Edgar Savisaar as Minister of Economy, also Minister of Social Affairs, Education, Culture and Interior). Local elections on 16 October 2005 were very successful to the Centre Party. It managed to win 32 seats out of 63 in Tallinn City Council, having now an absolute majority in that municipality. One of the factors behind this success in Tallinn was probably the immense popularity of Centre Party among Russian speaking voters. The controversial contract of co-operation between the Estonian Centre Party and the Russia&#x27;s dominant political party of power United Russia has probably contributed to the success in ethnic Russian electorate as well.

The Centre Party formed a one-party administration in the City of Tallinn led by Jüri Ratas, a 27-year-old politician elected the Mayor of Tallinn in November 2005. He was replaced by Savisaar in April 2007. The Centre Party is also a member of coalitions in 15 other major towns of Estonia like Pärnu, Narva, Haapsalu and Tartu. In the 2007 Estonian parliamentary election, the party received 143,528 votes (26.1% of the total), an improvement of +0.7%. They took 29 seats, a gain of one seat compared to the 2003 elections, though due to the 2004 defections which had decreased their strength, they actually gained 10 seats. They are now the second largest party in Parliament and the largest opposition party. In 2008, the party criticised Andrus Ansip&#x27;s policies, that in Centre Party&#x27;s opinion have contributed to Estonia&#x27;s economic problems of recent times. On 16 June 2007, Edgar Savisaar and Jaan Õmblus published a proposal of how to improve what they regard as Estonia&#x27;s economic crisis.

In the European Parliament elections of 2009, the Centre Party gained the most votes and 2 out of 6 Estonian seats, which were filled by Siiri Oviir and Vilja Savisaar. In local elections of 2009, the party strengthened its absolute majority in the Tallinn city council. Despite their absolute majority, they formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Party. Recent polls suggest the party is especially popular amongst Estonia&#x27;s Russophone minority. On 9 April 2012, eight prominent Centre Party members decided to leave the party citing frustration of their attempts to bring openness and transparency into party leadership. Previously MP Kalle Laanet was expelled on 21 March for his criticism of the party leadership. The leaving politicians included MEPs Siiri Oviir and Vilja Savisaar-Toomast, MPs Inara Luigas, Lembit Kaljuvee, Deniss Boroditš and Rainer Vakra, and also Ain Seppik, Toomas Varek. In the local elections of 20 October 2013, the Center Party and its leader Edgar Savisaar were successful, obtaining the absolute majority in the city of Tallinn with 53% of votes, winning 46 seats out of 79 (2 more than the 2009 results), considerably more than the second party, the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union, which received 19% of votes and 16 seats.

The Estonian Centre Party obtained a good result in the 2015 election, obtaining 24.8% of votes and electing 27 MPs. The party remained in opposition to the new government of Taavi Rõivas, which was supported by the Estonian Reform Party, the Social Democratic Party and the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union. In Autumn 2016, Savisaar stepped down as party leader and Jüri Ratas was elected in his place. In November 2016, the Social Democratic Party and the Pro Patria Union withdrew from the government coalition and entered a no-confidence motion against the government, together with the Estonian Centre Party. On 9 November 2016, the Riigikogu approved the motion with a 63–28 vote and Rõivas was forced to resign; in a following coalition talk, the Centre Party, SDE and IRL formed a new coalition led by Center Party&#x27;s chairman Jüri Ratas. The new government was sworn in on 23 November.

===Parliamentary elections of 2019===

In the 2019 parliamentary election, the Centre Party lost support while the opposition Estonian Reform Party gained support and won a plurality in election. After the election, the head of the Centre Party, Jüri Ratas turned down an offer by the Reform Party for coalition talks and entered into talks with Isamaa and Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia (EKRE), the latter widely considered a far-right party. Ratas had previously ruled out forming a coalition with EKRE during the election campaign because of its hostile views. The inclusion of EKRE in coalition talks after the elections was met with local and international criticism. In a poll conducted after the start of the coalition talks, the party of Jüri Ratas further lost support.

The critics of the decision have claimed that Ratas is willing to sacrifice his party&#x27;s values, the confidence of his voters and the stability and reputation of the country to keep his position as prime minister. Ratas has countered that his first duty is to look for ways to get his party included in the government to be able to work in the benefit of his voters and that the coalition would continue to firmly support the EU, NATO and would be sending out messages of tolerance.

Some key members and popular candidates of the party have been critical of the decision, with Raimond Kaljulaid leaving the board of the party in protest. Yana Toom, a member of the Centre Party and its representative in the European Parliament expressed criticism of the decision. Mihhail Kõlvart, popular among the Russian-speaking voters, has said the Centre Party cannot govern with EKRE&#x27;s approach. On 5 April 2019, Raimond Kaljulaid announced his decision to quit the party, deciding to sit as an independent member of the Parliament.

====Coalition government (2021–2022)====
In January 2021, after the resignation of Jüri Ratas as Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas formed a Reform Party-led grand coalition government with the Estonian Centre Party. However, on 3 June 2022, Kallas dismissed the seven ministers affiliated with the Centre Party, governing as a minority government until a new coalition without the Centre Party was formed on 8 July.

=== In opposition (2022–present) ===
In the 2023 parliamentary election, the Centre Party received 15.3% of the vote and 16 seats in the Riigikogu. The party remained in opposition. Following a donation from businessman Parvel Pruunsild that split the party&#x27;s board and led to a special congress, party leader Jüri Ratas announced his intention to not run for leadership again. Following the announcement, he endorsed Tanel Kiik as his successor while Tallinn mayor Mihhail Kõlvart declared his candidacy for leadership. Pundits speculated the election to be the most important in the party&#x27;s history, with Kiik being perceived as representing the liberal and Estonian-speaking wing of the party while Kõlvart was seen as the representation of the conservative and Russian-speaking wing. Kõlvart won the leadership election with 543 votes against Kiik&#x27;s 489, being elected the third leader in the party&#x27;s history.

In September 2023, Kõlvart won the Centre Party&#x27;s leadership election. His victory marked a significant change in the party&#x27;s direction, choosing to focus more on its Russophone electoral base and shifting to socially conservative and economically syncretic positions, with the party becoming seen as one specifically of the niche Russian minority concentrated in the capital Tallinn and Ida-Viru County. As a result, in the following months the previous party leader Jüri Ratas and several other party members defected to other political forces, leaving Centre Party with one third of its initial parliamentary representation (down to only 6 MPs) and with an increasingly weaker position in the following opinion polls.

In August 2024, Jaak Madison, an MEP and former member of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia, joined the Centre Party. Madison rejected allegations that the party was pro-Russian and stated that he wished to reorient the party as a conservative people&#x27;s party.

On 14 September 2024, the party withdrew from the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, citing a policy divergence on issues of European integration between the Centre Party and ALDE.

The Estonian Centre Party has been described as a social-liberal, or left-conservative, party that is in favour of the social market economy, and it has been also described as populist. It is the main stronghold for Russian-speaking citizens. Its political position has been described as either centrist, centre-left, or left-wing, since it combines left-wing populist elements and social liberalism. This is despite the fact that the party holds positions considered contrary to social liberalism on a number of issues. For example, the party suggests that Estonia should deliberate re-establishing criminal punishments for the possession of even small amounts of illegal substances, and the Centre Party&#x27;s parliamentary faction did not agree on its stance in regards to same-sex marriage, which is traditionally supported by social liberals. Party leader Jüri Ratas opposes same-sex marriage, while his preferred successor in the 2023 leadership election, Tanel Kiik, stated his support for it. Political scientist Martin Mölder labelled the party as left-conservative, adding that the party&#x27;s voter base is &quot;equally as conservative as Isamaa&quot;. Former Prime Minister Andrus Ansip also pointed to the party&#x27;s conservative voter base. The potential alliance of Isamaa, EKRE, and the Centre Party has often been labelled as the &quot;conservative camp&quot;, &quot;conservative wing&quot;, or &quot;conservative alliance&quot;, while many experts regard the party as having a notable liberal and conservative wing, highlighted by the 2023 leadership election. 

The party claims that its goal is the formation of a strong middle class in Estonia. The Centre Party declares itself as a &quot;middle class liberal party&quot;; however, against the backdrop of Estonia&#x27;s economically liberal policies, the Centre Party has a reputation of having more left-leaning policies. Historically, the party has been the most popular party among Russian-speaking citizens. In 2012, it was supported by up to 75% of ethnic non-Estonians.&#x27;

==European representation==
The Estonian Center Party currently has two members of the European Parliament, one of whom sits in the Renew Europe group and the other of whom sits in the European Conservatives and Reformists group. In the European Committee of the Regions, the Estonian Center Party sits in the Renew Europe CoR group, with one alternate member for the 2020–2025 mandate.

<doc id="379559" wikidata="Q384181" url="?curid=379559" title="Freestyle rap">
<text>Freestyle is a style of hip hop music where an artist normally improvises an unwritten verse from the head, with or without instrumental beats, in which lyrics are recited with no particular subject or structure. It is similar to other improvisational music, such as jazz, where a lead instrumentalist acts as an improviser with a supporting band providing a beat. Freestyle originally was simply verse that is free of style, written rhymes that do not follow a specific subject matter, or predetermined cadence. The newer style with the improvisation grew popular starting in the early 1990s. It is now mainly associated with hip hop.

==Original definition==
In the book &quot;How to Rap&quot;, Big Daddy Kane and Myka 9 note that originally a freestyle was a spit on no particular subject – Big Daddy Kane said, &quot;in the &#x27;80s, when we said we wrote a freestyle rap, that meant that it was a rhyme that you wrote that was free of style... it&#x27;s basically a rhyme just bragging about yourself.&quot; Myka 9 adds, &quot;back in the day, freestyle was bust[ing] a rhyme about any random thing, and it was a written rhyme or something memorized&quot;. Divine Styler says: &quot;in the school I come from, freestyling was a non-conceptual written rhyme... and now they call freestyling off the top of the head, so the era I come from, it&#x27;s a lot different&quot;. Kool Moe Dee also refers to this earlier definition in his book, &quot;There&#x27;s A God On The Mic&quot;:

There are two types of freestyle. There&#x27;s an old-school freestyle that&#x27;s basically rhymes that you&#x27;ve written that may not have anything to do with any subject or that goes all over the place. Then there&#x27;s freestyle where you come off the top of the head.

In old school hip-hop, Kool Moe Dee claimed that improvisational rapping was instead called &quot;coming off the top of the head&quot;, and Big Daddy Kane stated, &quot;off-the-top-of-the-head [rapping], we just called that &#x27;off the dome&#x27;when you don&#x27;t write it and [you] say whatever comes to mind&quot;.

Referring to this earlier definition (a written rhyme on non-specific subject matter), Big Daddy Kane stated, &quot;that&#x27;s really what a freestyle is&quot; and Kool Moe Dee refers to it as &quot;true&quot; freestyle, and &quot;the real old-school freestyle&quot;. Kool Moe Dee suggests that Kool G Rap&#x27;s track &quot;Men At Work&quot; is an &quot;excellent example&quot; of true freestyle, along with Rakim&#x27;s &quot;Lyrics of Fury&quot;.

==Newer definition==
Since the early 1990s onwards, with the popularization of improvisational rapping from groups and artists such as Freestyle Fellowship through to fresh fest competitions, &quot;freestyle&quot; has come to be the widely used term for rap lyrics that are improvised on the spot. This type of freestyle is the focus of Kevin Fitzgerald&#x27;s documentary, &quot;&quot;, where the term is used throughout by numerous artists to mean improvisational rapping.

Kool Moe Dee suggests the change in how the term is used happened somewhere in the mid to late 1980s, saying, &quot;until 1986, all freestyles were written&quot;, and &quot;before the 1990s, it was about how hard you could come with a written rhyme with no particular subject matter and no real purpose other than showing your lyrical prowess.&quot;

Myka 9 explains that Freestyle Fellowship helped redefine the term&quot;that&#x27;s what they say I helped doI helped get the world to freestyle, me and the Freestyle Fellowship, by inventing the Freestyle Fellowship and by redefining what freestyle is... We have redefined what freestyle is by saying that it&#x27;s improvisational rap like a jazz solo&quot;.

Although this kind of freestyling is very well respected today, Kool Moe Dee states that this was not the case previously:

A lot of the old-school artists didn&#x27;t even respect what&#x27;s being called freestyle now... any emcee coming off the top of the head wasn&#x27;t really respected. The sentiment was emcees only did that if they couldn&#x27;t write. The coming off the top of the head rhymer had a built-in excuse to not be critiqued as hard.

==Methodology of improvised freestyle==
Many rappers learn to rap through improvised freestyling, and by making freestyling into a conversation or a rhyming game which they play frequently as a way to practice, as described in the book &quot;How to Rap&quot;. Reasons for freestyling include entertainment, as a therapeutic activity, to discover different ways of rapping, promoting oneself, increasing versatility, or as a spiritual activity. Improvised freestyling can also be used in live performances, to do things such as giving something extra to the crowd and to cover up mistakes. To prove that a freestyle is being made up on the spot (as opposed to something pre-written or memorized), rappers will often refer to places and objects in their immediate setting, or will take suggestions on what to rhyme about.

Freestyles are performed a cappella, over beatboxing (as seen in &quot;&quot;), or over instrumental versions of songs. Freestyling is often done in a group setting called a &quot;cypher&quot; (or &quot;cipher&quot;) or as part of a &quot;freestyle battle&quot;. Due to the improvised nature of freestyle, meter and rhythm are usually more relaxed than in conventional rapping. Many artists base their freestyle on their current situation or mental state, but have a ready supply of prepared lyrics and rhyme patterns they can use as filler. Freestyling can also be used as a songwriting method for albums or mixtapes.

==Types of freestyles==
A freestyle battle is a contest in which two or more rappers or MCs compete or &quot;battle&quot; each other using improvised lyrics. It is a prominent part of contemporary Hip Hop culture and originated in the African-American community. In a freestyle battle, each competitor&#x27;s goal is to &quot;diss&quot; their opponent through clever lyrics and wordplay, with heavy emphasis being placed upon the rapper&#x27;s improvisational ability. Many battles also include metaphorically violent imagery, complementing the &quot;battling&quot; atmosphere. It is considered dishonorable or shameful to recite pre-written or memorized raps during a freestyle battle, because it shows the rapper to be incapable of &quot;spitting&quot; spur-of-the-moment lyrics. A live audience is key, as a large part of &quot;winning&quot; a battle is how an audience responds to each rapper. Appointed judges may be used in formal contests, but in most cases, the rapper who receives the largest audience response is viewed as the victor.

In modern times, with the rise of leagues such as King of the Dot and Ultimate Rap League, most battles are written, with some freestyling incorporated into the verses. This allows for more intricate rhymes and insults.

As hip-hop evolved in the early 1980s, many rappers gained their fame through freestyle battles. Battles can take place anywhere: informally on street corners, on stage at a concert, at a school, or at events specifically meant for battling (such as Scribble Jam or the Blaze Battle).

A &quot;cypher&quot; or &quot;cipher&quot; is an informal gathering of rappers, beatboxers, and/or breakdancers in a circle, in order to jam musically together. The term has also in recent years come to mean the crowd that forms around freestyle battles, consisting of spectators and onlookers. This group serves partly to encourage competition and partly to enhance the communal aspect of rap battles. The cypher is known for &quot;making or breaking reputations in the Hip Hop community; if you are able to step into the cypher and tell your story, demonstrating your uniqueness, you might be more accepted&quot;. These groups also serve as a way for messages about Hip Hop styles and knowledge to be spread, through word-of-mouth and encouraging trends in other battles.
==Longest freestyle==
On May 6, 2020, American rapper and slam poet George Watsky, best known for his rapid delivery, set the world record for longest freestyle at 33 hours, 33 minutes and 19 seconds. He held this record for 3 years until Japanese rapper PONEY beat it in April 2023 at 48 hours.

<text>In music, form refers to the structure of a musical composition or performance. In his book, &quot;Worlds of Music&quot;, Jeff Todd Titon suggests that a number of organizational elements may determine the formal structure of a piece of music, such as &quot;the arrangement of musical units of rhythm, melody, and/or harmony that show repetition or variation, the arrangement of the instruments (as in the order of solos in a jazz or bluegrass performance), or the way a symphonic piece is orchestrated&quot;, among other factors. It is, &quot;the ways in which a composition is shaped to create a meaningful musical experience for the listener.&quot; 

These organizational elements may be broken into smaller units called phrases, which express a musical idea but lack sufficient weight to stand alone. Musical form unfolds over time through the expansion and development of these ideas. In tonal harmony, form is articulated primarily through cadences, phrases, and periods. &quot;&quot;Form&quot; refers to the larger shape of the composition. Form in music is the result of the interaction of the four structural elements,&quot; of sound, harmony, melody, and rhythm.

Although, it has been recently stated that form can be present under the influence of musical contour, also known as Contouric Form. In 2017, Scott Saewitz brought attention to this concept by highlighting the occurrence in Anton Webern&#x27;s Op.16 No.2. 

Compositions that do not follow a fixed structure and rely more on improvisation are considered free-form. A fantasia is an example of this. Composer Debussy in 1907 wrote that, &quot;I am more and more convinced that music is not, in essence, a thing that can be cast into a traditional and fixed form. It is made up of colors and rhythms.&quot;

==Labeling==
To aid in the process of describing form, musicians have developed a simple system of labeling musical units with letters. In his textbook &quot;Listening to Music&quot;, professor Craig Wright writes:
Some writers also use a prime label (such as B′, pronounced &quot;B prime&quot;, or B″, pronounced &quot;B double prime&quot;) to denote sections that are closely related, but vary slightly.

==Levels of organization==
The founding level of musical form can be divided into two parts: 
* The arrangement of the pulse into unaccented and accented beats, the cells of a measure that, when harmonized, may give rise to a motif or figure.
* The further organization of such a measure, by repetition and variation, into a true musical phrase having a definite rhythm and duration that may be implied in melody and harmony, defined, for example, by a long final note and a breathing space. This &quot;phrase&quot; may be regarded as the fundamental unit of musical form: it may be broken down into measures of two or three beats, but its distinctive nature will then be lost. Even at this level, the importance of the principles of repetition and contrast, weak and strong, climax and repose, can be seen. Thus, form may be understood on three levels of organization. For the purpose of this exposition, these levels can be roughly designated as &quot;passage&quot;, &quot;piece&quot;, and &quot;cycle&quot;.

===Passage===
The smallest level of construction concerns the way musical phrases are organized into musical sentences and &quot;paragraphs&quot; such as the verse of a song. This may be compared to, and is often decided by, the verse form or meter of the words or the steps of a dance.

For example, the twelve bar blues is a specific verse form, while common meter is found in many hymns and ballads and, again, the Elizabethan galliard, like many dances, requires a certain rhythm, pace and length of melody to fit its repeating pattern of steps. Simpler styles of music may be more or less wholly defined at this level of form, which therefore does not differ greatly from the loose sense first mentioned and which may carry with it rhythmic, harmonic, timbral, occasional and melodic conventions.

===Piece (or movement) ===
The next level concerns the entire structure of any single self-contained musical piece or movement. If the hymn, ballad, blues or dance alluded to above simply repeats the same musical material indefinitely then the piece is said to be in strophic form overall. If it repeats with distinct, sustained changes each time, for instance in setting, ornamentation or instrumentation, then the piece is a theme and variations. If two distinctly different themes are alternated indefinitely, as in a song alternating verse and chorus or in the alternating slow and fast sections of the Hungarian czardas, then this gives rise to a simple binary form. If the theme is played (perhaps twice), then a new theme is introduced, the piece then closing with a return to the first theme, we have a simple ternary form.

Great arguments and misunderstanding can be generated by such terms as &#x27;ternary&#x27; and &#x27;binary&#x27;, as a complex piece may have elements of both at different organizational levels. A minuet, like any Baroque dance, generally had a simple binary structure (AABB), however, this was frequently extended by the introduction of another minuet arranged for solo instruments (called the &quot;trio&quot;), after which the first was repeated again and the piece ended—this is a ternary form—ABA: the piece is binary on the lower compositional level but ternary on the higher. Organisational levels are not clearly and universally defined in western musicology, while words like &quot;section&quot; and &quot;passage&quot; are used at different levels by different scholars whose definitions, as Schlanker points out, cannot keep pace with the myriad innovations and variations devised by musicians.

===Cycle===
The grandest level of organization may be referred to as &quot;cyclical form&quot;. It concerns the arrangement of several self-contained pieces into a large-scale composition. For example, a set of songs with a related theme may be presented as a song-cycle, whereas a set of Baroque dances were presented as a suite. The opera and ballet may organize song and dance into even larger forms. The symphony, generally considered to be one piece, nevertheless divides into multiple movements (which can usually work as a self-contained piece if played alone). This level of musical form, though it again applies and gives rise to different genres, takes more account of the methods of musical organisation used. For example: a symphony, a concerto and a sonata differ in scale and aim, yet generally resemble one another in the manner of their organization. The individual pieces which make up the larger form may be called movements.

== Common forms in Western music ==
Scholes suggested that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and fugue (although musicologist Alfred Mann emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions).

Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as &quot;sectional, developmental, or variational.&quot;

===Sectional form===
This form is built from a sequence of clear-cut units that may be referred to by letters but also often have generic names such as introduction and coda, exposition, development and recapitulation, verse, chorus or refrain, and bridge. Sectional forms include:

====Strophic form====

Strophic form – also called verse-repeating form, chorus form, AAA song form, or one-part song form – is a song structure in which all verses or stanzas of the text are sung to the same music

====Medley or &quot;chain&quot; form====

Medley, potpourri or chain form is the extreme opposite, that of &quot;unrelieved variation&quot;: it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections (ABCD...), sometimes with repeats (AABBCCDD...).

====Binary form====
The term &quot;Binary Form&quot; is used to describe a musical piece with two sections that are about equal in length. Binary Form can be written as AB or AABB. Using the example of Greensleeves provided, the first system is almost identical to the second system. We call the first system A and the second system A′ (A prime) because of the slight difference in the last measure and a half. The next two systems (3rd and 4th) are almost identical as well, but a new musical idea entirely than the first two systems. We call the third system B and the fourth system B&#x27; (B prime) because of the slight difference in the last measure and a half. As a whole, this piece of music is in Binary Form: AA′BB′.

====Ternary form====

Ternary form is a three-part musical form in which the third part repeats or at least contains the principal idea of the first part, represented as ABA. There are both simple and compound ternary forms. Da capo arias are usually in simple ternary form (i.e. &quot;from the head&quot;). A compound ternary form (or trio form) similarly involves an ABA pattern, but each section is itself either in binary (two sub-sections which may be repeated) or (simple) ternary form.

====Rondo form====
This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called &quot;episodes&quot;. It may be asymmetrical (ABACADAEA) or symmetrical (ABACABA). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a &quot;development&quot; of it. A similar arrangement is the ritornello form of the Baroque concerto grosso. Arch form (ABCBA) resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme.

====Variational form====

Variational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.

Theme and Variations: a theme, which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only &quot;section&quot; and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A,B,A,F,Z,A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the Passacaglia and Chaconne, was that of the ground bass—a repeating bass theme or &quot;basso ostinato&quot; over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning polyphonic or contrapuntal threads, or improvising divisions and descants. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form &quot;par excellence&quot; of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The Rondo is often found with sections varied (AA1BA2CA3BA4) or (ABA1CA2B1A).

====Sonata-allegro form====

Sonata-allegro form (also &quot;sonata form&quot; or &quot;first movement form&quot;) is typically cast in a greater ternary form, having the nominal subdivisions of &quot;exposition, development&quot; and &quot;recapitulation&quot;. Usually, but not always, the &quot;A&quot; parts (exposition and recapitulation, respectively) may be subdivided into two or three themes or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the &quot;B&quot; part (the development)—thus, e.g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A1ab1+coda).

The sonata form is &quot;the most important principle of musical form, or formal type from the classical period well into the twentieth century.&quot; It is usually used as the form of the first movement in multi-movement works. So, it is also called &quot;first-movement form&quot; or &quot;sonata-allegro form&quot; (because usually the most common first movements are in allegro tempo).

Each section of sonata form movement has its own function:

* It may have an &quot;introduction&quot; at the beginning.
* Following the introduction, the &quot;exposition&quot; is the first required section. It lays out the thematic material in its basic version. There are usually two themes or theme groups in the exposition, and they are often in contrasting styles and keys and connected by a transition. In the end of the exposition, there is a closing theme which concludes the section.
* The exposition is followed by the &quot;development&quot; section in which the material in the exposition is developed.
* After the development section, there is a returning section called &quot;recapitulation&quot; where the thematic material returns in the tonic key.
* At the end of the movement, there may be a &quot;coda&quot;, after the recapitulation.

== Forms used in Western popular music ==

Some forms are used predominantly within popular music, including genre-specific forms. Popular music forms are often derived from strophic form (AAA song form), 32-bar form (AABA song form), verse-chorus form (AB song form) and 12-bar blues form (AAB song form).

===Sectional forms===

* AABA a.k.a. American Popular
* AB a.k.a. Verse/Chorus
** ABC a.k.a. Verse/Chorus/Bridge
* ABAB
* ABAC a.k.a. Verse/Chorus/Verse/Bridge
* ABCD a.k.a. Through-composed
* Blues Song forms
** AAB a.k.a. Twelve-bar blues
** 8-Bar Blues
** 16-Bar Blues
See 

===Extended forms===
Extended form are forms that have their root in one of the forms above, however, they have been extended with additional sections. For example:

* AAAAA
* AABABA

===Compound forms===
Also called Hybrid song forms. Compound song forms blend together two or more song forms.

===Section names in popular music===

* Introduction a.k.a. Intro
* Verse
* Refrain
* Pre-chorus / Rise / Climb
* Chorus
* Post-chorus
* Bridge
* Middle-Eight
* Solo / Instrumental Break
* Collision
* CODA / Outro
* Ad Lib (Often in CODA / Outro)

==Cyclical forms==
In the 13th century the song cycle emerged, which is a set of related songs (as the suite is a set of related dances). The oratorio took shape in the second half of the 16th century as a narrative recounted—rather than acted—by the singers.

<text>The People&#x27;s Union of Estonia () was a political party in Estonia. Its last leader was Margo Miljand.

In the 2003 parliamentary election, the party collected 64,463 votes, which made 13.0% share of all votes and 13 mandates out of 101. In 2007&#x27;s election, this dropped to 39,211 votes (7.1% of the total, a drop of 5.9%), and six seats in the Riigikogu, a loss of 7. It has dropped from fourth to sixth place among parties, having been bested by the Social Democratic Party and (narrowly) by the Greens.

==History==
The party was founded on 29 September 1994 in Tallinn under the name of Estonian Country People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Eesti Maarahva Erakond, EME&quot;). On 18 October 1999 the party was renamed to People&#x27;s Union of Estonia. On 10 June 2000 the People&#x27;s Union merged with the Estonian Country Union (&quot;Eesti Maaliit, EML&quot;) and with the Estonian Party of Pensioners and Families (&quot;Eesti Pensionäride ja Perede Erakond, EPPE&quot;), becoming the largest political party in Estonia. Another merger with the New Estonia Party (&quot;Erakond Uus Eesti&quot;) in 2003 resulted in further growth of membership. In 2010, there were more than 9,000 official members in the People&#x27;s Union of Estonia.

The People&#x27;s Union of Estonia was an agrarian party with populist, social democratic influences. Consequently, the party experienced difficulties in gaining wider support in cities and big towns. The last couple of years brought along some changes. The representation of the People&#x27;s Union in towns (including the capital Tallinn) grew and they started to work on involving Russian-speaking minority in political activities. Russian Association of the People&#x27;s Union was founded in 2005. The People&#x27;s Union had a youth organisation called the Youth of the People&#x27;s Union (&quot;Rahvaliidu Noored&quot;), which had approximately 3000 members.

On the European level the People&#x27;s Union was a member of the Alliance for Europe of the Nations, but did not have any representatives in the European Parliament. The official organ of the Union was &quot;The Caring Estonia&quot; (&quot;Hooliv Eesti&quot;).

The first Chairman of the party was the previous President of the Republic of Estonia, Arnold Rüütel. On 10 June 2000 Villu Reiljan became the new Chairman of the People&#x27;s Union. He served also as the Minister of Environment when the People’s Party participated in the Reform Party’s coalition government.

The Union was a member of Estonian government coalitions from 1995 to 1999 and from 2003 to 2007. From 2003 to 2005 they were in government together with the Estonian Reform Party and the Union for the Republic - Res Publica. Following a vote of no confidence against the government of Prime Minister Juhan Parts and Parts&#x27; subsequent resignation from the post of Prime Minister, they took part in formation of the new coalition where Res Publica was replaced with the Estonian Centre Party (see Andrus Ansip&#x27;s cabinet).

In 2003 Estonian parliamentary election the party collected 64,463 votes, which made 13% share of all votes and 13 mandates out of 101. In comparison with previous election in 1999 they gained 6 additional seats in the Estonian Parliament. The representation of the party grew to 16 seats in 2005 when Toomas Alatalu, Robert Lepikson and Jaanus Marrandi, former members of the Estonian Centre Party decided to join the People&#x27;s Union. After Robert Lepikson&#x27;s death on 1 July 2005 the People’s Party lost a seat, because he was elected in Centre Party list, and his replacement came therefore from the CPE list.

In local elections on 16 October 2005 the People&#x27;s Union was also rather successful, winning 4 seats in Tallinn City Council and becoming part of coalitions in Tartu, Pärnu and Viljandi. In Tallinn the candidates of the People&#x27;s Union ran in the list of the Social Democratic Party which has fueled speculations about the possible merger of the two parties. Chairmen of both parties have declared those speculations groundless.

Following the People’s Party’s poor performance in the March 2007 parliamentary elections, it was not reappointed to the coalition government, which continued to be led by the Reform Party. The Center Party and the People’s Party were replaced by the Social Democrats and Pro Patria/Res Publica.

After continued worsening of election results, ERL started to look for a possible merging partner; in 2010, talks with the Social Democratic Party were successfully concluded, and a special congress on merging ERL into the SDE was to be held on 23 May 2010. However, at the party congress, only 172 delegates out of 412 supported the deal; it was considered likely that the ERL would merge with the Centre Party instead. Following the failed merger attempt, leading ERL members left the party and joined the SDE. Since defections (three MPs joined the SDE, one the Reform Party and one Center Party) the ERL had only 1 MP left, which means that it did not have a faction status.

In the 2011 parliamentary election, the ERL did not pass 5% threshold and became an extra-parliamentary party.

Finally, on 24 March 2012, the party merged with the Estonian Patriotic Movement into the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia. In an earlier 2006 press release, the Patriotic Movement had characterized the People&#x27;s Union (and Center Party) as traitors. According to surveys carried out by TNS Emor, the party has lost all its support (0% in April and May 2012).

<text>Wilmer McLean (May 3, 1814 – June 5, 1882) was an American wholesale grocer from Virginia. His house, near Manassas, Virginia, was involved in the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861. After the battle, he moved to Appomattox, Virginia, to escape the war, thinking that it would be safe. Instead, in 1865, General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant in McLean&#x27;s house in Appomattox. His houses were, therefore, involved in one of the first and one of the last encounters of the American Civil War.

==American Civil War==

===First Battle of Bull Run===

The initial engagement on July 21, 1861, of what would become the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) took place on McLean&#x27;s farm, the Yorkshire Plantation, in Manassas, Prince William County, Virginia. Union Army artillery fired at McLean&#x27;s house, which was being used as a headquarters for Confederate Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, and a cannonball dropped through the kitchen fireplace. Beauregard wrote after the battle, &quot;A comical effect of this artillery fight was the destruction of the dinner of myself and staff by a Federal shell that fell into the of my headquarters at the McLean House.&quot;

McLean was a retired major in the Virginia militia but, at age 47 he was too old to return to active duty at the outbreak of the Civil War. He made his living during the war as a sugar broker supplying the Confederate States Army. He decided to move because his commercial activities were centered mostly in southern Virginia and the Union army presence in his area of northern Virginia made his work difficult. He undoubtedly was also motivated by a desire to protect his family from a repetition of their combat experience. In the spring of 1863, he and his family moved about south to Appomattox County, Virginia, near a crossroads community called Appomattox Court House.

===Appomattox Court House===

On April 9, 1865, the war revisited McLean. Confederate General Robert E. Lee was about to surrender to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant. He sent a messenger to Appomattox Court House to find a place to meet. On April 8, 1865, the messenger knocked on McLean&#x27;s door and requested the use of his home, to which McLean reluctantly agreed. Lee surrendered to Grant in the parlor of McLean&#x27;s house, effectively ending the Civil War. Later, McLean is supposed to have said, &quot;The war began in my front yard and ended in my front parlor.&quot;

Once the ceremony was over, members of the Army of the Potomac began taking the tables, chairs, and various other furnishings in the house — essentially, anything that was not tied down — as souvenirs. They simply handed money to the protesting McLean as they made off with his property. Major General Edward Ord paid $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) for the table Lee had used to sign the surrender document, while Major General Philip Sheridan took the table on which Grant had drafted the document for $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) in gold. Sheridan then asked George Armstrong Custer to carry it away on his horse. The table was presented to Custer&#x27;s wife and is now on exhibit at the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian. An authentic recreation of McLean&#x27;s second home is now part of the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park operated by the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior.

==After the war==

After the war, McLean and his family sold their house in 1867, unable to keep up the mortgage payments, and returned to their home in Manassas. They later moved to Alexandria, Virginia. He worked for the Internal Revenue Service from 1873 to 1876.

Wilmer McLean died in Alexandria and is buried there at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Cemetery.

<doc id="379568" wikidata="Q957299" url="?curid=379568" title="Dutch Schultz">
<text>Dutch Schultz (born Arthur Simon Flegenheimer; August 6, 1901October 24, 1935) was an American mobster based in New York City in the 1920s and 1930s. He made his fortune in organized crime-related activities, including bootlegging and the numbers racket. Schultz&#x27;s rackets were weakened by two tax evasion trials led by United States Attorney Thomas Dewey, and also threatened by fellow mobster Lucky Luciano.

Schultz asked the Commission for permission to kill Dewey, in an attempt to avert his conviction, which they refused. When Schultz disobeyed them and made an attempt to kill Dewey, the Commission ordered his murder in 1935. Schultz was shot at a restaurant in Newark, New Jersey, and died the next day.

==Early life==
Arthur Simon Flegenheimer was born in the Bronx borough of New York City on August 6, 1901. He was the second child of German Jewish immigrants Herman and Emma Flegenheimer (née Neu), who had married in Manhattan on November 10, 1900. He had a younger sister, Helen, born in 1904. Flegenheimer&#x27;s father apparently abandoned his family, and his mother is listed as divorced in the 1910 United States census. In her 1932 petition for U.S. citizenship, however, she wrote that her husband had died in 1910–though it is unclear whether he died before or after the 1910 census. 

This event traumatized young Flegenheimer, who spent the rest of his life denying that his father had abandoned his family. He dropped out of school in the eighth grade to help support himself and his mother. He worked as a feeder and pressman for the Clark Loose Leaf Company, Caxton Press, American Express and Schultz Trucking in the Bronx between 1916 and 1919.

===Criminal beginnings===
Before turning to burglary, Flegenheimer worked at a neighborhood nightclub owned by a small-time mobster, where he robbed craps games. Eventually he was caught breaking into an apartment and sent to the prison on Blackwell&#x27;s Island (now called Roosevelt Island). His mugshot, at age 18, was published in the 2010 book &quot;New York City Gangland&quot;. Flegenheimer proved to be such an unmanageable prisoner that he was transferred to a work farm in Westhampton, Long Island. After he was recaptured following an escape, he had two months added to his sentence.

Flegenheimer was released on parole on December 8, 1920, and went back to work at Schultz Trucking. With the enactment of the Volstead Act and the start of Prohibition, the shipping company began smuggling alcoholic beverages into New York City from Canada. This led Flegenheimer to start associating with known criminals. It was also during this time that Flegenheimer became better known as &quot;Dutch&quot; Schultz. Following a disagreement, he left Schultz Trucking and went to work for their Italian competitors.

==Criminal career==
===Bootlegger===
In the mid-1920s, Schultz had begun work as a bouncer at the Hub Social Club, a small speakeasy in the Bronx owned by a gangster named Joey Noe. Noe was impressed with Schultz&#x27;s reputation for brutality and made him a partner. Together they soon opened more illegal drinking establishments around the Bronx. Using their own trucks to reduce high delivery costs, they brought in beer made by Frankie Dunn, a brewer in Union City, New Jersey. Schultz often rode shotgun to guard the trucks from hijackers.

Schultz and Noe soon had to deal with brothers John and Joe Rock, who were already running a bootlegging operation in the Bronx. Initially the brothers refused to buy beer from Noe and Schultz, but eventually John, the elder brother, agreed to cooperate; however, his younger brother Joe refused. One night the Noe-Schultz gang kidnapped Joe, beat him and hung him by his thumbs from a meat hook. They then allegedly wrapped a gauze bandage smeared with discharge from a gonorrhea infection over his eyes. Joe&#x27;s family reportedly paid $35,000 for his release. Shortly after his return, he went blind. From then on, the Noe-Schultz gang met little opposition as they expanded across the entire Bronx. Bootlegging during Prohibition made Schultz very wealthy.

===Gang wars===
The Noe-Schultz operation, which had begun to flourish in the Bronx, soon became the only gang able to rival the network of Italian crime syndicates that became the Mafia&#x27;s Five Families. When the gang expanded from the Bronx over to Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side and the neighborhoods of Washington Heights, Yorkville and Harlem, they moved their headquarters to East 149th Street in the Bronx. However, this brazen move led to a bootleg war with New York&#x27;s Irish mob, led by Jack &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond.

In the early hours of October 16, 1928, Noe was shot several times outside the Chateau Madrid, a speakeasy at 231 West 54th. Although seriously wounded, he managed to return fire. A blue Cadillac was seen hitting some parked cars and losing one of its doors before speeding away. When police found the car an hour later, they discovered the body of a Louis Weinberg (no relation to Schultz gang members Abraham &quot;Bo&quot; Weinberg and George Weinberg) in the backseat. Noe&#x27;s wounds became infected, and he died on November 21. Schultz was left angry and distraught by the loss of his friend and mentor.

Retaliation started a few weeks later when Arnold Rothstein, a crime boss in the Jewish mob, was found fatally shot near the service entrance to the Park Central Hotel on November 6, 1928. Although George &quot;Hump&quot; McManus supposedly killed Rothstein over an unpaid gambling debt, Schultz is believed to have ordered the killing in retribution for Noe&#x27;s death. This theory is supported by the fact that the first individual McManus rang after the killing was Schultz&#x27;s attorney, Dixie Davis. Schultz&#x27;s trusted lieutenant, Bo Weinberg, then picked up McManus and drove him away from the murder scene. McManus was later cleared of the killing.

On October 12, 1930, Diamond was shot and wounded at the Hotel Monticello on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side. Two gunmen forced their way into Diamond&#x27;s room and shot him five times before fleeing. Still in his pajamas, Diamond staggered into the hallway and collapsed. When asked later by the New York City police commissioner how he managed to walk out of the room, Diamond said he drank two shots of whiskey first. Diamond was rushed to the Polyclinic Hospital in Manhattan, where he eventually recovered. On December 30, 1930, Diamond was discharged from Polyclinic. During his absence, his gang was forced to leave the city. When he returned home, Diamond began carving out a new territory for himself in Albany. He was killed in an Albany rooming house at 67 Dove Street by two gunmen in December 1931.

Schultz also had to deal with internecine conflicts within his own gang. In 1930 one of his enforcers, Vincent Coll, demanded to be made an equal partner. This was because Schultz&#x27;s subordinates received a flat salary instead of the customary percentage from the take—a unique arrangement compared to other major gangs in organized crime. When Schultz refused, Coll formed his own crew with the ultimate goal of murdering Schultz and taking over his territory. In the bloody gang war that followed, Coll lost his older brother Pete and earned the nickname &quot;Mad Dog&quot; from the press after a child was killed during a botched assassination attempt committed by his gang. In February 1932, while Coll was taking a call in a drugstore phone booth, gunmen armed with machine guns entered the store and shot him to death. The killers may have included Edward &quot;Fats&quot; McCarthy and the brothers Bo and George Weinberg.

===Racketeer===
Along with the policy rackets, Schultz began extorting New York restaurant owners and workers. Working through a hulking gangster named Jules Modgilewsky (also known as Julie Martin), Schultz made deals with the leaders of Waiters Local 16 and Cafeteria Workers Local 302 to extort money by forcing restaurant owners to join the Metropolitan Restaurant &amp; Cafeteria Owners Association, an employer association that Schultz had founded. Those who refused to join the Association were faced with exorbitant wage demands from labor unions, followed by strikes and stink bomb attacks. The Association then stepped in to arrange a settlement of the strike with a sweetheart contract for low wages contingent on the employer joining the Association. Martin successfully extracted thousands of dollars of tributes and &quot;dues&quot; for Scultz from the terrorized restaurant owners.

During his tax trial, Schultz began to suspect that Martin was skimming from the shakedown operation; Schultz had recently discovered a $70,000 disparity in the books. On the evening of March 2, 1935, Schultz invited Martin to a meeting at the Harmony Hotel in Cohoes, New Yotk. At the meeting, at which chief enforcer Bo Weinberg and mob lawyer Dixie Davis were also present, Martin belligerently denied Schultz&#x27;s charges and began arguing with him. Both men were drinking heavily as the argument continued, and Schultz sucker-punched Martin. Finally, Martin admitted that he had taken $20,000, which he believed he was &quot;entitled to&quot; anyway. Davis related what happened next:

As Martin contorted on the floor, Schultz apologized to Davis for killing someone in front of him. When Davis later read a newspaper story about the murder, he was shocked to find out that the body was found on a snowbank with a dozen stab wounds to the chest. When Davis asked about this, Schultz replied, deadpan, &quot;I cut his heart out.&quot;

===Trials for tax evasion ===
In the early 1930s, United States Attorney Thomas Dewey had set his sights on convicting Schultz for non-payment of federal taxes. Schultz was indicted in New York in January 1933 and became a fugitive. He surrendered in Albany in November 1934 as part of a plan to have his trials moved from New York City to upstate. His first tax evasion trial, in Syracuse, ended in a hung jury, with many speculating he&#x27;d bribed the jurors. He would face retrial in Malone.

With the case going to a second trial, Schultz quickly set about presenting himself to the townspeople of Malone as a country squire and good citizen. He donated cash to local businesses, gave toys to sick children and performed other charitable deeds. The strategy worked, as he was acquitted in late summer 1935. New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia was so outraged at the verdict that he issued an order that Schultz should be arrested on sight should he return to the city. As a result, Schultz was forced to relocate his base of operations across the Hudson River to Newark, New Jersey.

==Assassination==
===Betrayal===
As his legal defense costs in tax case mounted, Schultz had found it necessary to reduce the commission he paid to those running his policy rackets to bolster what he called the &quot;Arthur Flegenheimer Defense Fund.&quot; This tactic angered the runners and the games&#x27; controllers, who, despite being threatened with violence for showing any dissent, hired a hall, held a mass protest meeting and declared their version of a strike. Very quickly the cash flow dried up, and Schultz was forced to back down, permanently damaging the relationship between his gang and their associates.

Bo Weinberg, Schultz&#x27;s chief lieutenant, was so concerned about the amount of money that Schultz was taking from the rackets that he sought advice from New Jersey mob boss Longy Zwillman, who put him in touch with the Sicilian-born gangster Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano. The deal that Weinberg wanted was to retain a percentage and keep overall control of the Schultz gang. However, Luciano planned to break up the gang&#x27;s rackets and territory among his own associates once Schultz was convicted of tax evasion. Believing that a guilty verdict was a foregone conclusion at the second trial, Luciano and his allies implemented their plan to take control, which met little resistance because of the ongoing bad feelings over the attempted pay cuts and the support of Weinberg.

However, after his acquittal, Schultz quickly arranged a meeting with Luciano through the Commission to clarify the situation. Luciano explained to Schultz that they were just &quot;looking after the shop&quot; while he was away to ensure that everything ran smoothly, and that full control of his rackets would be returned to Schultz once the heat died down. Publicly, Schultz was forced to accept that version of events because of the ongoing attention from law enforcement agencies and Dewey, now a special prosecutor appointed by LaGuardia. A month after his acquittal, Bo Weinberg disappeared after he had walked out of a Midtown Manhattan nightclub.

Schultz had proposed to the National Crime Syndicate, a confederation of mobsters, that Dewey be murdered. Luciano argued that the assassination of a high-profile prosecutor would precipitate a massive law enforcement crackdown. The Commission later voted unanimously against the proposal. An enraged Schultz told the group that he would kill Dewey anyway and walked out of the meeting. Later, Murder, Inc. leader Albert Anastasia approached Luciano with information that Schultz had asked him to stake out Dewey&#x27;s apartment building on Fifth Avenue. Upon hearing the news, the Commission held a discreet meeting to discuss the matter. After six hours of deliberations, the Commission ordered Louis Buchalter to eliminate &quot;The Dutchman.&quot;

===Shooting===
Dutch Schultz was shot on October 23, 1935 at the Palace Chop House restaurant at 12 East Park Street in Newark, along with his accountant Otto Berman; Abraham “Abe” Landau, his new chief lieutenant; and his personal bodyguard, Bernard &quot;Lulu&quot; Rosenkrantz. While Schultz was in the men&#x27;s room, two Murder, Inc. hitmen named Charles &quot;The Bug&quot; Workman and Emanuel &quot;Mendy&quot; Weiss entered the establishment. Workman walked the length of the bar and opened the door to the men&#x27;s room, where he encountered Schultz. Workman shot Schultz, who dropped to the floor. He then entered the rear dining room with Weiss, with both men firing numerous times at the Schultz gang members.

Berman collapsed immediately after he was shot. Landau&#x27;s carotid artery was severed by a bullet passing through his neck, and Rosenkrantz was hit repeatedly at point-blank range. Despite their injuries, both gangsters rose to their feet, returned fire and drove the assassins out of the restaurant. Weiss jumped into the getaway car and ordered the driver to abandon Workman. Landau chased Workman out of the bar and emptied his pistol at him but missed. After Workman had fled on foot, Landau collapsed onto a nearby trashcan.

Witnesses say Schultz staggered out of the bathroom, clutching his side and sat at his table. He called for anyone who could hear him to get an ambulance. Rosenkrantz rose to his feet and demanded that the barman, who had hidden during the shootout, give him some change. Rosenkrantz called for an ambulance before he lost consciousness.

When the first ambulance arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosenkrantz were the most seriously wounded and needed to be taken immediately to Newark City Hospital. A second ambulance was called to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering.

When the second ambulance arrived from Newark City Hospital, Schultz gave an intern in the ambulance $3,000 in cash because he thought he was dying and said that it was not going to do him any good where he was going. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz might live, the intern was so worried that he would come back for his cash that he handed in the money. Landau and Rosenkrantz refused to say anything to police until Schultz had given them permission after he had arrived in the second ambulance. Even then, they provided the police with only minimal information.

At 2:20 am, Berman, the oldest and least physically fit of the four men, was the first to die. Landau died of blood loss at 6 am. When Rosenkrantz was taken into surgery, the surgeons were so incredulous that he was still alive despite his blood loss and ballistic trauma that they were unsure of how to treat him. He eventually died from his injuries twenty-nine hours after the shooting.

===Death===
Schultz received the last rites from a Catholic priest at his request just before he went into surgery. He reportedly believed Jesus enabled him to beat an indictment and had promised to convert. He lingered for almost one day, speaking in various states of lucidity with his wife, mother, a priest, police and hospital staff before dying of peritonitis on October 24, 1935.

Schultz was permitted interment in the Roman Catholic Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, Westchester County, New York, but at the request of his Orthodox Jewish mother his body was draped with a talit, a traditional Jewish prayer shawl.

In 1941, Workman was convicted of killing Schultz and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was paroled in 1964. The building that housed the Palace Chop House was torn down in 2008.

==Final words and legacy==

Schultz&#x27;s last words were a strange stream-of-consciousness babble spoken in his hospital bed to police officers who attempted to calm him and question him for useful information. Although the police were unable to extract anything coherent from Schultz, his rambling was fully transcribed by a police stenographer. These include:

:A boy has never wept...nor dashed a thousand kim.
:You can play jacks, and girls do that with a soft ball and do tricks with it.
:Oh, Oh, dog Biscuit, and when he is happy he doesn&#x27;t get snappy.

Schultz&#x27;s last words have inspired a number of writers to devote works related to them. Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs published a screenplay in novel form titled &quot;The Last Words of Dutch Schultz&quot; in the early 1970s, while Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson connected Schultz&#x27;s words to a global Illuminati-related conspiracy, making them a major part of 1975&#x27;s &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;. In Wilson&#x27;s and Shea&#x27;s story, Schultz&#x27;s ramblings are a coded message. In his 1960 anthology &quot;Parodies,&quot; Dwight Macdonald presents Schultz&#x27;s last words as a parody of Gertrude Stein. In E. L. Doctorow&#x27;s novel &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot;, the title character uses clues from Schultz&#x27;s deathbed ramblings to locate his hidden money.

Although Schultz&#x27;s gang was meant to be crippled, several of his associates survived the night. Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Krompier, whom Schultz left in charge of his Manhattan interests while he hid in New Jersey, survived an assassination attempt the same night as the shootings at the Palace Chop House. No apparent attempt was made on the life of Irish mobster John M. Dunn, who later became the brother-in-law of mobster Edward J. McGrath and a powerful member of the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Irish mob.

After Schultz&#x27;s death, it was discovered that he and his wife had never gone through an official marriage ceremony, and the possible existence of another wife emerged with the discovery of letters and pictures of another woman and children among his effects at the hotel where he was staying in Newark. This was never resolved, as his common-law wife refused to talk about the matter and the mystery woman never came forward. Two other women also called at the morgue to receive his effects, but their identities were never established. 

Though Schultz was estimated to be worth $7 million when he died, no trace of the money was ever found. Shortly before his death, fearing that he would be incarcerated as a result of Dewey&#x27;s efforts, he commissioned the construction of a special airtight and waterproof safe into which he placed $7 million in cash and bonds (). Schultz and Rosenkrantz then drove the safe to an undisclosed location somewhere in upstate New York and buried it. At the time of his death, the safe was still interred. With no evidence to indicate that either Schultz or Rosenkrantz had ever revealed the location of the safe to anyone (or that it even existed), the exact location where it was buried died with them. Schultz&#x27;s enemies are said to have spent the remainder of their lives searching for the safe. As it has never been recovered, treasure hunters have annually returned to look for it in the Catskills. One such meeting became the documentary film &quot;Digging for Dutch: The Search for the Lost Treasure of Dutch Schultz&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Several actors have portrayed Dutch Schultz in film and television: Vic Morrow in &quot;Portrait of a Mobster&quot; (1961), Vincent Gardenia in &quot;Mad Dog Coll&quot; (1961), James Remar in &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), Dustin Hoffman in &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; (1991), Lance Henriksen in &quot;The Outfit&quot; (1993), and Tim Roth in &quot;Hoodlum&quot; (1997).

On television, in the 1959 &quot;The Untouchables&quot; episodes &quot;Vincent &#x27;Mad Dog&#x27; Coll&quot;, &quot;The Dutch Schultz Story&quot; and &quot;Jack &#x27;Legs&#x27; Diamond&quot;, Schultz was played by Lawrence Dobkin. In the 1993–1994 series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, he was portrayed by Si Osborne in the 1993 episode &quot;Attack on New York&quot;. In the 2015 AMC series &quot;The Making of the Mob: New York&quot;, he was played by Christopher Morrow.

On November 18, 2020, a PBS &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; episode entitled &quot;Gangster&#x27;s Gold&quot; premiered which detailed the investigation and the hunt for Schultz&#x27;s lost treasure. In July 2022, an episode of &quot;Expedition Unknown&quot;, titled &quot;The Bootlegger&#x27;s Millions&quot;, focused on Schultz and his treasure.

<text>Ballet as a music form progressed from simply a complement to dance, to a concrete compositional form that often had as much value as the dance that went along with it. The dance form, originating in France during the 17th century, began as a theatrical dance. It was not until the 19th century that ballet gained status as a &quot;classical&quot; form. In ballet, the terms &#x27;classical&#x27; and &#x27;romantic&#x27; are chronologically reversed from musical usage. Thus, the 19th century Classical period in ballet coincided with the 19th century Romantic era in music. Ballet music composers from the 17th–20th centuries, including the likes of Jean-Baptiste Lully, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Igor Stravinsky, and Sergei Prokofiev, were predominantly in France and Russia. Yet with the increased international notoriety seen in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s and Stravinsky&#x27;s lifetime, ballet music composition and ballet in general spread across the western world.

==History==
Until about the second half of the 19th century, the role of music in ballet was secondary, with the main emphasis on dance, while music was simply a compilation of danceable tunes. Writing &quot;ballet music&quot; used to be a job for musical craftsmen, rather than for masters. For example, critics of the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–1893) mentioned his writing of ballet music as something demeaning.

From the earliest ballets up to the time of Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632–1687), ballet music was indistinguishable from ballroom dance music. Lully created a style that was separate, wherein the music told a story. The first ballet d&#x27;action was staged in 1717. &quot;The Loves of Mars and Venus&quot; was a story told without words. The pioneer was John Weaver (1673–1760). Both Lully and Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683–1764) wrote opéra-ballets, where the story was partly danced and partly sung, but ballet music became gradually less important. 

The next big step occurred in the early years of the nineteenth century, when principal dancers changed from using hard shoes to ballet pumps. This enabled a more free-flowing style of music to be used. Marie Taglioni (1804–1884) is credited with being the first ballerina to dance en pointe in &quot;La Sylphide&quot; in 1832. It was now possible to have music that was more expressive. Gradually, dancing became more daring, with men lifting the ballerinas into the air.

Until the time of Tchaikovsky, the composer of ballets was considered to be separate from the composer of symphonies. Ballet music was an accompaniment for the solo and ensemble dances. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; was the first ballet score to be created by a symphonic composer. Following the initiative of Tchaikovsky, ballet composers were no longer writing simple, easily danceable pieces. The focus of a ballet was no longer solely the dance; the music behind the dances began to take an equal prevalence. In the late 19th century, Marius Petipa, French ballet choreographer and dancer, worked with composers such as Cesare Pugni to create ballet masterpieces that boasted both complex dance and complex music. Petipa worked with Tchaikovsky as well, whether through collaboration with Tchaikovsky on his work &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, or indirectly through revision of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; after the composer&#x27;s death.

In many cases ballets were still short scenes within operas, to enable scenery or costume changes. Perhaps the best-known example of ballet music that is part of an opera is the &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; from Amilcare Ponchielli&#x27;s opera &quot;La Gioconda&quot; (1876). There was a violent change in mood when Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; was first performed in 1913, at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris. The music was modernist and dissonant, and the movements were highly stylized. In 1924 George Antheil wrote &quot;Ballet Mécanique,&quot; which was actually for a film of moving objects, not for dancers, but it was pioneering in the use of jazz music. From this point dance music split into two directions: modern and jazz dance. George Gershwin attempted to bridge this gap with his ambitious score to the film &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (1937), composing over one hour of music that spanned from the cerebral and technical to foot-stomping jazz and rumba. One scene, Hoctor&#x27;s Ballet, was composed specifically for the ballerina Harriet Hoctor.

Another strand in the history of ballet music is the trend towards creative adaptations of old music. Ottorino Respighi took works by Gioachino Rossini (1792–1868) and strung them together into a ballet titled &quot;La Boutique fantasque&quot;, premiered in 1919. The audience for ballet generally prefers romantic music, hence new ballets are created from old works with new choreography. A well-known example is &quot;The Dream&quot; to the music of Felix Mendelssohn (1809–1847) arranged by John Lanchbery.

<text>World of Warcraft (WoW) is a 2004 massively multiplayer online role-playing (MMORPG) video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment for Windows and Mac OS X. Set in the &quot;Warcraft&quot; fantasy universe, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; takes place within the world of Azeroth, approximately four years after the events of the previous game in the series, &quot;Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.&quot; The game was announced in 2001, and was released for the 10th anniversary of the &quot;Warcraft&quot; franchise on November 23, 2004. Since launch, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; has had ten major expansion packs: &quot;The Burning Crusade&quot; (2007), &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot; (2008), &quot;Cataclysm&quot; (2010), &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot; (2012), &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot; (2014), &quot;Legion&quot; (2016), &quot;Battle for Azeroth&quot; (2018), &quot;Shadowlands&quot; (2020), &quot;Dragonflight&quot; (2022), and &quot;The War Within&quot; (2024). Two further expansions, &quot;Midnight&quot; and &quot;The Last Titan&quot;, were announced in 2023.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was inspired by other MMORPG&#x27;s, particularly &quot;EverQuest&quot;, with Blizzard setting out to make their own MMORPG and improving on the features of &quot;EverQuest&quot;. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; allows players to create a character avatar and explore an open game world in third- or first-person view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players. The game encourages players to work together to complete quests, enter dungeons and engage in player versus player (PvP) combat, however, the game can also be played solo without interacting with others. The game primarily focuses on character progression, in which players earn experience points to level up their character to make them more powerful and buy and sell items using in-game currency to acquire better equipment, among other game systems.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was a major critical and commercial success upon its original release in 2004 and quickly became the most popular MMORPG of all time, reaching a peak of 12 million subscribers in 2010. The game had over one hundred million registered accounts by 2014 and by 2017, had grossed over in revenue, making &quot;Warcraft&quot; one of the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time. The game has been cited by gaming journalists as the greatest MMORPG of all time and one of the greatest video games of all time and has also been noted for its long lifespan, continuing to receive developer support and expansion packs over 20 years since its initial release. In 2019, a vanilla version of the game titled &quot;World of Warcraft Classic&quot; was launched, allowing players to experience the base game before any of its expansions launched. Additional content for &quot;Classic&quot; was later released, including versions of some expansions.

==Gameplay==

===Starting a character or play session===
As with other MMORPGs, players control a character avatar within a game world in third- or first-person view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players. Also similar to other MMORPGs, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; requires the player to pay a subscription by using a credit or debit card, using prepaid Blizzard game cards or using a WoW Token purchased in-game. Players without a subscription may use a trial account that lets the player&#x27;s character reach level 20, but has many features locked.

To enter the game, the player must select a server, referred to in-game as a &#x27;realm&#x27;. Each realm acts as an individual copy of the game world and falls into one of two categories. Available realm types are:
* Normal – a regular type realm where the gameplay is mostly focused on defeating monsters and completing quests, with player-versus-player fights and any roleplay are optional.
* RP (roleplay) – which works the same way as a &quot;Normal&quot; realm, but focuses on players roleplaying in character.

Before the introduction of World of Warcraft&#x27;s seventh expansion &quot;Battle for Azeroth&quot;, both &quot;Normal&quot; and &quot;RP&quot; servers were each divided into two separate categories: PvE servers and PvP servers. This has since been removed after the implementation of the &quot;War Mode&quot; option, which allows any player (of level 20 and higher) on any server to determine whether they want to actively participate in PvP combat or not, by enabling War Mode in two of the game&#x27;s capital cities.

Realms are also categorized by language, with in-game support in the language available.

Players can make new characters on all realms within the region, and it is also possible to move already established characters between realms for a fee.

====Races and factions====

To create a new character, in keeping with the storyline of previous &quot;Warcraft&quot; games, players must choose between the opposing factions of the Alliance or the Horde; Pandaren, which were added in &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot;, do not commit to a faction until after the starting zone is completed. Characters from the opposing factions can perform rudimentary communication (most often just &quot;emotes&quot;), but only members of the same faction can speak, mail, group and join guilds. The player selects the new character&#x27;s race, such as orcs or trolls for the Horde, or humans or dwarves for the Alliance. Players must select the class for the character, with choices such as mages, warriors, and priests available. Most classes are limited to particular races.

===Ongoing gameplay===
As characters become more developed, they gain various talents and skills, requiring the player to further define the abilities of that character. Characters can choose two primary professions that can focus on producing items, such as tailoring, blacksmithing or jewelcrafting or on gathering from resource nodes, such as skinning or mining. Characters can learn all three secondary skills: archeology, cooking, and fishing. Characters may form and join guilds, allowing characters within the guild access to the guild&#x27;s chat channel, the guild name and optionally allowing other features, including a guild tabard, guild bank, guild repairs, and dues.

Much of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; play involves the completion of quests. These quests are usually available from NPCs. Quests usually reward the player with some combination of experience points, items, and in-game money. Quests allow characters to gain access to new skills and abilities, as well as the ability to explore new areas. It is through quests that much of the game&#x27;s story is told, both through the quest&#x27;s text and through scripted NPC actions. Quests are linked by a common theme, with each consecutive quest triggered by the completion of the previous, forming a quest chain. Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures, gathering a certain number of resources, finding a difficult to locate object, speaking to various NPCs, visiting specific locations, interacting with objects in the world, or delivering an item from one place to another to acquire experience and treasures.

While a character can be played on its own, players can group with others to tackle more challenging content. Most end-game challenges are designed in such a way that they can only be overcome while in a group. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; uses a &quot;rested bonus&quot; system, increasing the rate that a character can gain experience points after the player has spent time away from the game. When a character dies, it becomes a ghost—or wisp for Night Elf characters—at a nearby graveyard. Characters can be resurrected by other characters that have the ability or can self-resurrect by moving from the graveyard to the place where they died. If a character is past level ten and they resurrect at a graveyard, the items equipped by the character degrade, requiring in-game money and a specialist NPC to repair them. Items that have degraded heavily become unusable until they are repaired. If the location of the character&#x27;s body is unreachable, they can use a special &quot;spirit healer&quot; NPC to resurrect at the graveyard. When the spirit healer revives a character, items equipped by the character at that time are further degraded, and the character is significantly weakened by what is in-game called &quot;resurrection sickness&quot; for up to ten minutes, depending on the character&#x27;s level. This &quot;resurrection sickness&quot; does not occur and item degradation is less severe if the character revives by locating its body, or is resurrected by another player through spells or special items.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; contains a variety of mechanisms for player versus player (PvP) play. Players on player versus environment (PvE) servers can opt to toggle &quot;War Mode&quot; themselves, making themselves attackable to players of the opposite faction. Depending on the mode of the realm, PvP combat between members of opposing factions is possible at almost any time or location in the game world—the only exception being the starting zones, where the PvP &quot;flag&quot; must be enabled by the player wishing to fight against players of the opposite faction. PvE (called normal or RP) servers, by contrast, allow a player to choose whether or not to engage in combat against other players. On both server types, there are special areas of the world where free-for-all combat is permitted. Battlegrounds, for example, are similar to dungeons: only a set number of characters can enter a single battleground, but additional copies of the battleground can be made to accommodate additional players. Each battleground has a set objective, such as capturing a flag or defeating an opposing general, that must be completed to win the battleground. Competing in battlegrounds rewards the character with tokens and honor points that can be used to buy armor, weapons, and other general items that can aid a player in many areas of the game. Winning a battleground awards more honor and tokens than losing. In addition, players also earn honor when they or nearby teammates kill players in a battleground.

===Setting===
&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; is set in the same universe as the &quot;Warcraft&quot; series of real-time strategy games and has a similar art direction. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; contains elements from fantasy, steampunk, and science fiction, including gryphons, dragons, elves, steam-powered automata, zombies, werewolves, other horror monsters, time travel, spaceships, and alien worlds.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; takes place in a 3D representation of the &quot;Warcraft&quot; universe that players can interact with through their characters. The game world initially consisted of the two continents in Azeroth: Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. Four separate expansions later added to the game&#x27;s playable area the realms of Outland and Draenor and the continents of Northrend and Pandaria. As a player explores new locations, different routes and means of transportation become available. Players can access &quot;flight masters&quot; in newly discovered locations to fly to previously discovered locations in other parts of the world. Players can also use boats, zeppelins, or portals to move from one continent to another. Although the game world remains relatively similar from day to day, seasonal events reflecting real world events, such as Halloween (Hallow&#x27;s End), Christmas (Winter Veil), Children&#x27;s Week, Easter (Noblegarden), and Midsummer have been represented in the game world. Locations also have variable weather including, among other things, rain, snow, and dust storms.

A number of facilities are available for characters while in towns and cities. In each major city, characters can access a bank to deposit items, such as treasures or crafted items. Each character has access to personal bank storage with the option to purchase additional storage space using in-game gold. Additionally, guild banks are available for use by members of a guild with restrictions being set by the guild leader. Auction houses are available for players to buy and sell items to others in a similar way to online auction sites such as eBay. Players can use mailboxes, which can be found in almost every town. Mailboxes are used to collect items won at auction, and to send messages, items, and in-game money to other characters.

Some of the challenges in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; require players to group together to complete them. These usually take place in dungeons—also known as &quot;instances&quot;—that a group of characters can enter together. The term &quot;instance&quot; comes from each group or party having a separate copy, or instance, of the dungeon, complete with their own enemies to defeat and their own treasure or rewards. This allows a group to explore areas and complete quests without others interfering. Dungeons are spread over the game world and are designed for characters of varying progression. A typical dungeon will allow up to five characters to enter as part of a group. Some dungeons require more players to group together and form a &quot;raid&quot; of up to forty players to face some of the most difficult challenges. As well as dungeon-based raid challenges, several creatures exist in the normal game environment that are designed for raids to attack.

===Subscription===
&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; requires a subscription to allow continued play, with options to pay in one-month, three-month, or six-month blocks, and time cards of varying lengths available from retailers, or purchasing a &quot;WoW Token&quot; using in-game currency. Expansion packs are available online and from retailers. As the game client is the same regardless of the version of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; the user owns, the option to purchase expansions online was added as it allows for a quick upgrade. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; is also available as a free Starter Edition, which is free to play for an unlimited amount of time. Starter Edition characters are unable to gain experience after reaching level 20, and there are other restrictions in effect for Starter Edition accounts, including the inability to trade, use mail, use Auction House, use public chat channels, join guilds or amass more than ten gold.

In January 2015, accounts that have lapsed subscriptions, which previously would not let a player log in, work like a restricted Starter Edition account with the one difference that sub-level 20 characters will be able to join a guild if any other characters on the account are still in that guild.

In April 2015, an alternate way to cover the subscription was introduced. A player may spend real money ($20 in North America and differing amounts in other regions) on a WoW Token, which is sold on the auction house for the in-game currency, gold, that initially could only be used to add 30 days of playtime. At the launch of the feature in North America, a token sold for 30,000 gold and 24 hours later sold for 20,000 gold; therefore, the gold amount changes depending on what players are willing to spend. Subsequently, the amount that a North American token sells for remained at above 30,000 gold, and the other Battle.net regions were well above that value. Once a player buys a token on the auction house, it is account bound and cannot be resold. As of February 2017, the WoW Token can also be exchanged for $15 in Battle.net balance that can be used as credit for purchases in most of Blizzard&#x27;s games as well as in &quot;Destiny 2&quot;.

===Parental controls===
The company offers parental controls that allow various limits to be set on playing time. It is possible to set a daily limit, a weekly limit, or to specify an allowed playing schedule. In order to control these settings, it is necessary to log in with different credentials than are used just to enter the game. It is also possible to receive statistics on the time spent playing. Apart from controlling children, adults sometimes use parental controls on themselves. The company supports this kind of protection as otherwise the potential players or their supervisors may choose to uninstall or block the game permanently.

==Plot==

Intent on settling in Durotar, Thrall&#x27;s Horde expanded its ranks by inviting the undead Forsaken to join orcs, tauren, and trolls. Meanwhile, dwarves, gnomes, and the ancient night elves pledged their loyalties to the Alliance, guided by the human kingdom of Stormwind. After Stormwind&#x27;s king, Varian Wrynn, mysteriously disappeared, Highlord Bolvar Fordragon served as Regent but his service was affected by the mind control of the black dragon Onyxia, who ruled in disguise as a human noblewoman. As heroes investigated Onyxia&#x27;s manipulations, the ancient elemental lord Ragnaros resurfaced to endanger both the Horde and Alliance. The heroes of the Horde and Alliance defeated Onyxia and sent Ragnaros back to the Elemental Plane.

===Assault on Blackwing Lair===
Deep within Blackrock Mountain, the black dragon Nefarian conducted twisted experiments with the blood of other dragonflights. Intent on seizing the entire area for his own, he recruited the remaining Dark Horde, a rogue army that embraced the demonic bloodlust of the old Horde. These corrupt orcs, trolls, and other races battled against Ragnaros and the Dark Iron dwarves for control of the mountain. Nefarian created the twisted chromatic dragons and a legion of other aberrations in his bid to form an army powerful enough to control Azeroth and continue the legacy of his infamous father, Deathwing the Destroyer. Nefarian was vanquished by the heroes from the Horde and the Alliance.

===Rise of the Blood God===
Years ago, in the ruined temple of Atal&#x27;Hakkar, loyal priests of the Blood God Hakkar the Soulflayer attempted to summon the wrathful deity&#x27;s avatar into the world. But his followers, the Atal&#x27;ai priesthood, discovered that the Soulflayer could only be summoned within the Gurubashi tribe&#x27;s ancient capital, Zul&#x27;Gurub. Newly reborn in this jungle fortress, Hakkar took control of the Gurubashi tribe and mortal champions of the trolls&#x27; mighty animal gods. The Soulflayer&#x27;s dark influence was halted when the Zandalari tribe recruited heroes and invaded Zul&#x27;Gurub.

===The Gates of Ahn&#x27;Qiraj===
The great desert fortress of Ahn&#x27;Qiraj, long sealed behind the Scarab Wall, was home to the insectoid qiraji, a savage race that had once mounted an assault to devastate the continent of Kalimdor. But something far more sinister lurked behind Ahn&#x27;Qiraj&#x27;s walls: the Old God C&#x27;Thun, an ancient entity whose pervasive evil had suffused Azeroth since time immemorial. As C&#x27;Thun incited the qiraji to frenzy, both the Alliance and Horde prepared for a massive war effort. A mixed force of Alliance and Horde soldiers, dubbed the Might of Kalimdor, opened the gates of Ahn&#x27;Qiraj under the command of the orc Varok Saurfang. The heroes laid siege to the ruins and temples of Ahn&#x27;Qiraj and vanquished C&#x27;Thun.

===Shadow of the Necropolis===
In the Lich King&#x27;s haste to spread the plague of undeath over Azeroth, he gifted one of his greatest servants, the lich Kel&#x27;Thuzad, with the flying citadel of Naxxramas, as a base of operations for the Scourge. Consistent attacks from the Scarlet Crusade and Argent Dawn factions weakened the defenses of the floating fortress, enabling an incursion from the heroes that led to Kel&#x27;Thuzad&#x27;s defeat. However, a traitor among the ranks of the knightly order of the Argent Dawn ran away with Kel&#x27;Thuzad&#x27;s cursed remains and fled to Northrend, where the fallen lich could be reanimated.

==Development==
After releasing &quot;StarCraft&quot; in 1998, Blizzard began work on its next title. Initially, this was a project known as &quot;Nomad&quot;, based on the tabletop role-playing game &quot;Necromunda&quot; that took place in a post-apocalyptic setting. Over its first year of development, &quot;Nomad&quot; did not have a strong sense of direction; at that time, many of the Blizzard developers had also become fans of the MMORPG &quot;EverQuest&quot;, released in 1999 by Verant Interactive. Interest waned in &quot;Nomad&quot; as the company talked about making their own MMORPG, based on the &quot;Warcraft&quot; series and improving on aspects that they felt did not work from &quot;EverQuest&quot;. In a management vote, all but Duane Stinnett, the project lead on &quot;Nomad&quot;, voted for this shift, and work on &quot;Nomad&quot; stopped by the end of 1999 as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was initiated.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was first announced by Blizzard at the ECTS trade show in September 2001. Released in 2004, development of the game took roughly 4–5 years, including extensive testing. The 3D graphics in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; use elements of the proprietary graphics engine originally used in &quot;Warcraft III&quot;. The game was designed to be an open environment where players are allowed to do what they please. Quests are optional and were designed to help guide players, allow character development, and to spread characters across different zones to try to avoid what developers called &quot;player collision&quot;. The game interface allows players to customize appearance and controls, and to install add-ons and other modifications.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; runs natively on both Mac and Windows platforms. Boxed copies of the game use a hybrid CD to install the game, eliminating the need for separate Mac and Windows retail products. The game allows all users to play together, regardless of their operating system. Although there is no official version for any other platform, support for &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; is present in Windows API implementations Wine and CrossOver allowing the game to be played under Linux and FreeBSD. While a native Linux client is neither released nor announced by Blizzard, in January 2011 IT journalist Michael Larabel indicated in a Phoronix article that an internal Linux client might exist but is not released due to the non-standardization of the Linux distro ecosystem.

===Regional variations===
In the United States, Canada, and Europe, Blizzard distributes &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; via retail software packages. The software package includes 30 days of gameplay for no additional cost. To continue playing after the initial 30 days, additional play time must be purchased using a credit card or prepaid game card. The minimum gameplay duration that a player can purchase is 30 days using a credit card, or 60 using a prepaid game card. A player also has the option of purchasing three or six months of gameplay at once for a 6–15% discount. In Australia, the United States, and many European countries, video game stores commonly stock the trial version of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; in DVD form, which includes the game and 20 levels of gameplay, after which the player would have to upgrade to a retail account by supplying a valid credit card, or purchasing a game card as well as a retail copy of the game.

In Brazil, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was released on December 6, 2011, via BattleNet. The first three expansions are currently available, fully translated, including voice acting, into Brazilian Portuguese.

In South Korea, there is no software package or CD key requirement to activate the account. However, to play the game, players must purchase time credits online. There are two kinds of time credits available: one where the player is billed based on the actual number of minutes that will be available, and one where the player can play the game for a number of days. In the former, time can be purchased in multiples of 5 hours or 30 hours, and in the latter, time can be purchased in multiples of 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months. As software packages are not required, expansion pack contents are available to all players on launch day.

In &quot;World of Warcraft&#x27;s&quot; initial Chinese release, players could purchase hourly and daily tokens, which were typically used to play at Internet cafés. The initial Chinese release was immensely popular, in part because many Chinese had already played the game on North American and European servers.

The Chinese government and NetEase, the licensee for &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; in China, have imposed a modification on Chinese versions of the game which places flesh on bare-boned skeletons and transforms dead character corpses into tidy graves. These changes were imposed by the Chinese government in an attempt to &quot;promote a healthy and harmonious online game environment&quot; in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. The Chinese government delayed the release of the &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot; expansion, due to what it deemed objectionable content. NetEase took over licensing of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; from The9 in June 2009 following the expiration of The9&#x27;s contract, and were able to secure a launch for &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot; on August 31, 2010, nearly two years after its Western release. Due to a contract dispute, these servers were shut down on January 23, 2023. In April 2024, NetEase announced that &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; services would be returning to China in the Summer of 2024, later leading to a livestream on June 27, 2024, in which Blizzard team members outlined the release of the &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot; for &quot;World of Warcraft Classic&quot; and &quot;The War Within&quot; expansion for &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; for Chinese players.

===Post-release content===
The &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; launcher (referred to in press releases and the menu bar as the &quot;Blizzard Launcher&quot;) is a program designed to act as a starting point for &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; players. It provides a way to launch &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and starts the Blizzard updater. It was first included with the version 1.8.3 patch. The 2.1.0 patch allowed for an option to bypass the use of the launcher. Features of the launcher include news and updates for &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; players, access to &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;″s support website, access to the test version of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; when it is available to test upcoming patches, updates to Warden, and updates to the updater itself. The 3.0.8 patch redesigned the launcher and added the ability to change the game settings from the launcher itself. The launcher update from patch 4.0.1 also allows people to play the game while non-crucial pieces of the game are downloaded. This requires a high-speed broadband internet connection.

Patch 1.9.3 added native support for Intel-powered Macs, making &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; a universal application. As a result of this, the minimum supported Mac OS X version has been changed to 10.3.9; &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; version 1.9.3 and later will not launch on older versions of Mac OS X. PowerPC architecture Macs are no longer supported since version 4.0.1.

When new content is added to the game, official system requirements may change. In version 1.12.0 the requirements for Windows were increased from requiring 256 MB to 512 MB of RAM. Official Windows 98 technical support was dropped, but the game continued to run there until version 2.2.3. Before Mists of Pandaria in 2012, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; officially dropped support for Windows 2000, followed by Windows XP and Vista in October 2017, as well as all 32-bit support.

Starting with 4.3, players could try out an experimental 64-bit version of the client, which required manual downloading and copying files into the installation folder. Since 5.0, the 64-bit client is automatically installed, and used by default. 

Since World IPv6 Day, the client and most of the servers support IPv6.

===Expansions===

Ten expansions have been released: &quot;The Burning Crusade&quot;, released in January 2007; &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot;, released in November 2008; &quot;Cataclysm&quot;, released in December 2010; &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot;, released in September 2012; &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot;, released in November 2014; &quot;Legion&quot;, released in August 2016; &quot;Battle for Azeroth&quot;, released in August 2018; &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, released in November 2020; &quot;Dragonflight&quot;, released in November 2022 and &quot;The War Within&quot;, released in August 2024. Players are not required to purchase expansions in order to continue playing; however, new content and features such as higher level caps and new areas may not be available until they do so.

The fifth expansion, &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot;, was announced at BlizzCon 2013 on November 8, 2013, and entered beta on June 27, 2014. &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot; was released on November 13, 2014. On August 6, 2015, Blizzard announced the sixth expansion, &quot;Legion&quot;, at Gamescom 2015. In November 2015, the &quot;Legion&quot; alpha testing started and in April 2016 the beta test started; the &quot;Legion&quot; expansion was released on August 30, 2016. The seventh expansion, &quot;Battle for Azeroth&quot;, was released worldwide on August 13 and 14 (depending on location) in 2018. The eighth expansion, &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, was announced on November 1, 2019, and released on November 23, 2020. The ninth expansion, &quot;Dragonflight&quot;, was announced on April 19, 2022 and was released on November 28, 2022. At BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard announced the &quot;Worldsoul Saga&quot;, a story arc that would span the course of three expansions: &quot;The War Within&quot;, &quot;Midnight&quot; and &quot;The Last Titan&quot;, set to begin in 2024.

Blizzard routinely applies older expansions to all accounts as new expansions are released. On June 28, 2011, &quot;The Burning Crusade&quot; expansion was automatically applied to all previous &quot;Warcraft&quot; accounts at no cost. On September 19, 2012, the same thing was done with the &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot; expansion, and on October 15, 2013, the &quot;Cataclysm&quot; expansion was also applied. On October 15, 2014, &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot; was applied to all accounts following the release of &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot;. On May 17, 2016, &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot; was applied to all accounts to coincide with the release of the &quot;Warcraft&quot; movie that gives a 30-day trial of the game.
All &quot;The Burning Crusade&quot;, &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot;, &quot;Cataclysm&quot;, &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot; and &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot; content is now effectively part of the original game, with all new &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; accounts automatically including these expansions upon creation. As of the release of &quot;The War Within&quot; expansion in 2024, all expansions up to &quot;Dragonflight&quot; are included in the base game.

===Music===
The soundtrack for the original release of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was composed and arranged by Jason Hayes, Tracy W. Bush, Derek Duke, and Glenn Stafford and conducted by Eímear Noone. Most of the music from the game and the cinematic trailers was released in the official album on November 23, 2004, together with the collector&#x27;s edition of the game. It is sold separately on one CD in the MP3 format. More music was composed for each of the game&#x27;s expansions, which were also given their own album releases.

On January 12, 2011, Alfred Publishing produced a sheet music series for vocalists, pianists, strings, and other instruments, &quot;World of Warcraft Sheet Music Anthology&quot; in solo and accompaniment formats with CD. These works include four pages of collectible artwork and vary by number of songs included.

In 2018, a remix of the song from the game, &quot;Hymn of the Firstborn Son&quot;, was nominated for &quot;Best Game Music Cover/Remix&quot; at the 16th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards.

==Reception==
&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; received very positive reviews upon release, following a period of high anticipation before launch. Although the game follows a similar model to—and was noted for using many familiar concepts from—the role-playing genre, the new approaches to reducing pauses between game encounters were well liked. A common example was the approach to character death. In some previous MMORPGs, a player would suffer a high penalty for character death; in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, a player is able to recover and start playing quickly. Combat was another area where &quot;downtime&quot;, or pauses between play, was reduced. By allowing all character types to recover from damage taken, players can return to combat quickly. Reviewers felt that these changes in pacing would make the genre more accessible to casual players—those who play for short periods of time— while still having &quot;deep&quot; gameplay that would attract players of all levels of interest. The concept of a &quot;rested bonus&quot;, or increasing the rate at which a player&#x27;s character gains experience, was also welcomed as a way for players to quickly catch up with their friends in progression.

Questing was described as an integral part of the game, often being used to continue a storyline or lead the player through the game. The high number of quests in each location was popular, as well as the rewards for completing them. It was felt that the range of quests removed the need for a player to &quot;grind&quot;, or carry out repetitive tasks, to advance their character. Quests also require players to explore every section of the game world, potentially causing problems for social gamers or roleplayers seeking somewhere quiet. Quests that required the player to collect items from the corpses of creatures they had killed were also unpopular; the low &quot;drop rate&quot;, or chance of finding the items, makes them feel repetitive as a high number of creatures need to be killed to complete the quest. A large number of new players in a particular area meant that there were often no creatures to kill, or that players would have to wait and take turns to kill a particular creature to complete a quest. Some critics mentioned that the lack of quests that required players to group up made the game feel as if it were designed for solo play. Others complained that some dungeon or instanced group quests were not friendly to new players, and could take several hours to complete. Upon release, a small number of quests had software bugs that made them impossible to complete.

Characters were felt to be implemented well, with each class appearing &quot;viable and interesting&quot;, having unique and different mechanisms, and each of the races having a distinct look and feel. Character development was also liked, with the talent mechanism offering choice to players, and profession options being praised. Character customization options were felt to be low, but the detail of character models was praised.

The appearance of the game world was praised by critics. Most popular was that a player could run from one end of the continent to the other without having to pause at a &quot;loading screen&quot; while part of the game is retrieved from storage. The environment was described as &quot;breathtaking&quot;. Players found it difficult to become lost, and each area in the game world had a distinct look that blended from one to the next. Critics described the environment as &quot;a careful blend of cartoon, fantasy art, and realism&quot;. The game was found to run smoothly on a range of computer systems, although some described it as basic, and mentioned that the bloom light rendering effect can blur things. One reviewer described the ability to fly over long stretches of scenery as &quot;very atmospheric&quot;. The user interface was liked, being described as &quot;simple&quot;, with tooltips helping to get the player started.

The game&#x27;s audio was well received, particularly the background music. By assigning music to different areas of the game world, reviewers felt that the fantasy style added to the player&#x27;s immersion, and that the replay value was increased. The sounds and voices used by characters and NPCs, as well as the overall sound effects, were felt to add a &quot;personality&quot; to the game.

===Accolades===
&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; won several awards from critics upon release, including &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; awards. In addition, it won several annual awards from the media, being described as the best game in the role-playing and MMORPG genres. The graphics and audio were also praised in the annual awards, with the cartoonish style and overall sound makeup being noted. The game was also awarded &quot;Best Mac OS X Entertainment Product&quot; at the 2005 Apple Design Awards. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; the best computer game of 2004, and the magazine&#x27;s Steve Bauman described his &quot;feeling that Blizzard has analyzed every element of every existing game, pulled out the best ones, and then lovingly lavished an absurd amount of attention to their implementation&quot;. It also won the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Art Direction&quot;, &quot;Best Original Music&quot; and &quot;Best Interface&quot; awards.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was recognized at the 2005 Spike TV Video Game Awards where it won &quot;Best PC Game&quot;, &quot;Best Multiplayer Game&quot;, &quot;Best RPG&quot;, and &quot;Most Addictive Game&quot;. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; with &quot;Massively Multiplayer/Persistent World Game of the Year&quot;, as well as nominations for &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Game of the Year&quot;. In 2008, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was honoured—along with &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; and &quot;EverQuest&quot;—at the 59th Annual Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for advancing the art form of MMORPG games. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best massively multiplayer game of 2004, and nominated it for the publication&#x27;s &quot;Best Graphics, Artistic&quot; award. In 2009, &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; 11th on their list of &quot;The Top 200 Games of All Time&quot;. In 2015, the game placed 3rd on USgamer&#x27;s The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list. In 2015, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was the best-selling PC game of 2005 and 2006. In the United States, it sold 1.4 million copies ($68.1 million) by August 2006. It was the country&#x27;s third best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. On January 22, 2008, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; had more than 10 million subscribers worldwide, with more than 2 million subscribers in Europe, more than 2.5 million in North America, and about 5.5 million in Asia. At its peak in October 2010 the game had 12 million subscribers. As of November 2014 the game has over 10 million active subscribers. On January 28, 2014, Blizzard announced that 100 million accounts have been created for the game. On May 7, 2015, it was announced that there were 7.1 million active subscriptions. At the end of June 2015, subscriptions dropped down to 5.6 million, lowest since 2005. By the end of September, subscribers were at 5.5 million.

Less than two months after beginning operation of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; in China on September 19, 2009, NetEase was ordered to immediately stop charging players and to cease accepting registrations. A press estimate indicated that if &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; were shut down in China, the loss of subscribers would have caused Activision Blizzard&#x27;s earnings to fall from 65 cents per share to 60 cents per share. In April 2008, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was estimated to hold 62 percent of the MMORPG subscription market. The game has grossed in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing video games of all time, along with &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. In early 2012, Blizzard started its own series of tournaments for &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and &quot;StarCraft II&quot;, known as the Battle.net World Championship Series.

==Security concerns==
In September 2006, reports emerged of spoof &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; game advice websites that contained malware. Vulnerable computers would be infected through their web browsers, downloading a program that would then relay back account information. Blizzard&#x27;s account support teams experienced high demand during this episode, stating that many users had been affected. Claims were also made that telephone support was closed for isolated periods due to the volume of calls and resulting queues. In April 2007, attacks evolved to take advantage of further exploits involving animated cursors, with multiple websites being used. Security researcher group Symantec released a report stating that a compromised &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; account was worth US$10 on the black market, compared to US$6 to US$12 for a compromised computer (correct as of March 2007). In February 2008, phishing emails were distributed requesting that users validate their account information using a fake version of the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; account management pages. In June 2008, Blizzard announced the &quot;Blizzard Authenticator&quot;, available as a hardware security token or mobile application that provides two-factor security. The token generates a one-time password based code that the player supplies when logging on. The password, used in addition to the user&#x27;s own password, is only valid for a couple of minutes, thus providing extra security against keylogging malware.

Blizzard makes use of a system known as Warden on the Windows version of the game to detect third-party programs, such as botting software, allowing &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; to be played unattended. There has been some controversy as to the legality of Warden. Warden uses techniques similar to anti-virus software to analyze other running software on the players&#x27; PCs, as well as the file system. However, unlike most anti-virus software, it sends a portion of this information back to Blizzard, which caused privacy advocates to accuse it of being spyware. One example of the information Warden collects is the title of every window open on the system while &quot;WoW&quot; is running. On the other hand, many gamers responded positively to the development, stating that they supported the technology if it resulted in fewer cases of cheating. Blizzard&#x27;s use of Warden was stated in the Terms of Agreement (TOA).

The Warden&#x27;s existence was acknowledged in March 2008, during the opening legal proceedings against MDY Industries. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Arizona, and also listed Michael Donnelly as a defendant. Donnelly was included in the suit as the creator of MMO Glider, software that can automatically play many tasks in the game. Blizzard claimed the software is an infringement of its copyright and software license agreement, stating that &quot;Glider use severely harms the WoW gaming experience for other players by altering the balance of play, disrupting the social and immersive aspects of the game, and undermining the in-game economy.&quot; Donnelly claims to have sold 100,000 copies of the $25 software.

===Real ID===
On July 6, 2010, Blizzard Entertainment announced that on its forums for all games, users&#x27; accounts would display the real names tied to their accounts. Blizzard announced the change following an agreement with Facebook to allow Facebook to connect persons who choose to become friends to share their real identity (Real ID, as Blizzard calls the feature). The integration of the feature into the forums on the Blizzard Entertainment site raised concerns amongst fans of the many game series Blizzard has created over the years.

In response to the concerns, Blizzard released an updated statement on July 9, 2010, announcing that the Real ID integration with the official forums was being canceled.

== Community and study of player interaction ==

In addition to playing the game itself and conversing on discussion forums provided by Blizzard, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; players often participate in the virtual community in creative ways, including fan artwork and comic strip style storytelling.

Blizzard garnered criticism for its decision in January 2006 to ban guilds from advertising sexual orientation preferences. The incident occurred after several players were cited for &quot;harassment&quot; after advocating a group that was a gay-straight alliance. Blizzard later reversed the decision to issue warnings to players promoting LGBT-friendly guilds.

On October 7, 2010 &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; reached a subscriber base of over 12 million players. Since May 2011, the number of players playing had decreased by 10% from 11.4 million to 10.3 million. Blizzard&#x27;s CEO Mike Morhaime said that the reason was probably due to a drop-off in the Eastern markets. In 2012, senior producer John Lagrave told Eurogamer that the drop in subscriptions may have also been attributed to the recent release of BioWare&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; has been the subject of academic study, particularly given its high profile and longevity. Early academic analysis of the game focused on player collaboration (especially guilds) and was conducted primarily by researchers in fields like game studies, anthropology, psychology, and communications. Bonnie Nardi&#x27;s &quot;My Life as a Night Elf Priest&quot; is one of the best-known &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; ethnographies. Over time, the game attracted researchers from other disciplines including economics, design, and philosophy.

=== Sale of virtual goods in the real world ===
As with other MMORPGs, companies have emerged offering to sell virtual gold and associated services. The practice of amassing gold and in-game items for financial profit is frequently referred to as gold farming. Friction resulted from U.S. players of the 2004 release finding themselves competing with Chinese-based players who were employed to generate in-game resources to be sold on trading sites. In addition to these differences in play style, the game had no translation features for in-game chat and therefore there was little communication between English-speaking and non-English speaking players. In her analysis of gold farming, media scholar Lisa Nakamura wrote that although &quot;players cannot see each other&#x27;s body while playing, specific forms of game labor, such as gold farming and selling, as well as specific styles of play, have become racialized as Chinese, producing new forms of networked racism that are particularly easy for players to disavow.&quot;

After Blizzard started offering free trial gameplay accounts, players noticed an increase in spam from bots advertising these services. One study shows that this problem is particularly prevalent on the European realms, with gold being over 14 times more expensive to buy on US realms than their European counterparts.

In patch 2.1, Blizzard responded to this by adding additional anti-spam mechanics including whisper throttling and the report spam function. Additionally, trial accounts are prevented from speaking in the public chat channels (although they may speak to players within range or whisper to other players that have first whispered to them), participating in in-game trades, and using the Auction House and the mail feature, among other limitations.

In May 2007, Blizzard filed a complaint against in Game Dollar LLC (trading as peons4hire) in U.S. federal court. In February 2008, the parties filed a consent decree in which in Game Dollar agreed to refrain from using any &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; chat or communication to advertise any business or sell any services relating to &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. In June 2007, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; player Antonio Hernandez filed a class action lawsuit against IGE for interfering with the intended use of the game.

As characters progress in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and take on some of the toughest challenges, many of the rewards received are bound to that character and cannot be traded, generating a market for the trading of accounts with well-equipped characters. The highest noted &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; account trade was for £5000 (€7000, US$9,900) in early September 2007. The high price was due to the character possessing items that at the time were owned by only a handful out of the millions of active players, due to the difficulty in acquiring them. However, Blizzard banned the account five days after the purchase.

The practice of buying or selling gold in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; has generated significant controversy. On February 21, 2008, Blizzard released a statement concerning the consequences of buying gold. Blizzard reported that an &quot;alarmingly high&quot; proportion of all gold bought originates from &quot;hacked&quot; accounts. The article also stated that customers who had paid for character leveling services had found their accounts compromised months later, with all items stripped and sold for virtual gold. The article noted that leveling service companies often used &quot;disruptive hacks ... which can cause realm performance and stability issues&quot;. In April 2015, introduced a means to sell in-game gold for real money. A player may spend $20 on a one-month &quot;game time token&quot; that can be sold for in-game gold on the auction house.

In December 2015, Blizzard sold an in-game battle pet named Brightpaw for $10 with all proceeds going to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. This resulted in a new Blizzard record donation of over $1.7 million to Make-A-Wish. In December 2016, Blizzard again sold a battle pet named Mischief for $10; it helped raise more than $2.5 million for Make-A-Wish. In September 2017, Blizzard sold a battle pet named Shadow the fox for $10, with proceeds going to the Red Cross to help with disaster relief.

=== Corrupted Blood plague incident ===

The Corrupted Blood plague incident was one of the first events to affect entire servers. Patch 1.7 saw the opening of Zul&#x27;Gurub, the game&#x27;s first 20-player raid dungeon where players faced off against a tribe of trolls. Upon engaging the final boss, players were stricken by a debuff called &quot;Corrupted Blood&quot; which would periodically sap their life. The disease was passed on to other players simply by being near infected players. Originally this malady was confined within the Zul&#x27;Gurub instance, but it made its way into the outside world by way of hunter pets or warlock minions that contracted the disease.

Within hours, Corrupted Blood had completely infected major cities because of their high player concentrations. Low-level players were killed in seconds by the high-damage disease. Eventually, Blizzard fixed the issue so that the plague could not exist outside of Zul&#x27;Gurub.

The Corrupted Blood plague so closely resembled the outbreak of real-world epidemics that scientists are currently looking at the ways MMORPGs or other massively distributed systems can model human behavior during outbreaks. The reaction of players to the plague closely resembled previously hard-to-model aspects of human behavior that may allow researchers to more accurately predict how diseases and outbreaks spread amongst a population.

== Legacy ==

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; redefined the MMORPG genre. Its innovations were not necessarily original in isolation, but together they created a model for the genre as a theme park rather than a simulation. Its environment had tonal variety with serious lore and full characters but the intention to entertain. The game used quest completion for experience progression, making gameplay into a shopping list and encouraging mobility rather than dominating a location. Its use of instanced dungeons let players progress together without running into others, such that different areas of the game had different purposes, separating places for group challenges, mass challenges, and leveling. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; original talent system, which let players distribute points among upgrades, saw wide adoption, including by &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; also gave structure to the &quot;raid&quot; group activity, in which players needed a specific strategy. Emergent behavior from raid strategies were later built into the game.

While not the first MMORPG to lead to hundreds of hours of commitment, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; was the most successful one in its time. &quot;Most people&quot;, wrote &quot;Vice&quot; in 2019, &quot;know someone who&#x27;s said they were &#x27;addicted&#x27; to &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;&quot;. For some, the game became a near-total obsession taking precedent over basic necessities and relationships. The game&#x27;s bountiful quests provided a sense of purpose or coping mechanism for many who were unfulfilled with their lives, even though that time investment resulted in little to no change to their life fulfillment. The game inspired Wowaholics Anonymous, a community for players seeking to quit playing. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; also provided hope and purpose to players, some leading to in-person romance.

The first &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;-themed restaurant opened in Beijing in 2008. In 2011, the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;-inspired amusement park, World Joyland Play Valley opened in China.

Prior to running Breitbart News and joining the Trump campaign and administration, Steve Bannon found a political audience in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; players. He was involved in Internet Gaming Entertainment, a company that employed &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; &quot;gold farmers&quot; whose gold would be resold for real money, which introduced Bannon to what he saw as &quot;rootless, white males&quot; with &quot;monster power&quot; even prior to the rise of Reddit. He built Breitbart into a far-right news and entertainment website in part by hiring Milo Yiannopoulos to pursue disaffected gamers.

Vitalik Buterin, who later co-founded the cryptocurrency Ethereum, was driven to pursue decentralized technologies following a 2010 patch that changed his &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; avatar&#x27;s preferred spell. Requests by &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; players also led Microsoft to alter how hotkeys work in their Windows operating system.

As part of the 20th anniversary of the release of the game, in 2024 Blizzard partnered with the University of Washington, temporarily renaming that university&#x27;s college football team &quot;University of Warcraft&quot;.

=== In other media ===
&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; has inspired artists to satirize it and acknowledge its mark in popular culture. One example is the Emmy Award-winning &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Make Love, Not Warcraft&quot;. The game has been used to advertise unrelated products, such as Toyota trucks.

In late 2007, a series of television commercials for the game began airing featuring pop culture celebrities such as Mr. T, William Shatner, and Verne Troyer discussing the virtues of the character classes they play in the game. A Spanish commercial featuring Guillermo Toledo, and a French commercial featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme, were also televised. Two more were shown in November 2008, featuring Ozzy Osbourne and Steve Van Zandt. Another commercial in the series, which began airing in November 2011, featured Chuck Norris and played on the Internet phenomenon of &quot;Chuck Norris facts&quot;.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; has inspired three board games: &quot;World of Warcraft: The Board Game&quot; (including &quot;Shadow of War&quot; and &quot;The Burning Crusade&quot; expansions), &quot;World of Warcraft: The Adventure Game&quot; (produced by Fantasy Flight Games), and a &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; edition of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;. There is also a trading card game, and a collectible miniatures game on the market, both formerly produced by Upper Deck Entertainment, now produced by Cryptozoic Entertainment. Cryptozoic released an &quot;Archives&quot; set which contains foil reproductions of older cards produced by Upper Deck. In August 2012, Megabloks launched a licensed line of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; &#x27;building block&#x27; toys based on the game scenes, scenarios and characters. In March 2014, &quot;Hearthstone&quot; was released, which is a free-to-play digital card game based on the &quot;Warcraft&quot; universe, using classes similar to &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.

In November 2007, DC Comics published the first issue of the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; comic under their WildStorm imprint.

In 2015, Blizzard released &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;, a crossover multiplayer online battle arena video game, in which players can control over 35 heroes from &quot;Warcraft&quot; universe such as Arthas, Gul&#x27;dan, Kel&#x27;thuzad, Malfurion, Ragnaros, Sylvanas, Thrall and Varian. The game features a &quot;Warcraft&quot;-themed battleground named Alterac Pass. A number of &quot;Warcraft&quot;-themed skins have been introduced for &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; in the &quot;Echoes of Alterac&quot; event in June 2018. Various soundtracks from &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, such as &quot;Obsidian Sanctum&quot; from &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot;, &quot;The Wandering Isle&quot; from &quot;Mists of Pandaria,&quot; and &quot;Stormwind&quot; theme, are present as background music in the game.

===Crossover promotions===

To mark the release of &quot;Hearthstone&quot;, Blizzard released the Hearthsteed mount for &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; players. The mount is obtained through winning three games in Arena or Play mode. Widely advertised on various &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; websites, this promotion encourages &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; players to try &quot;Hearthstone&quot; and marked the first significant crossover implemented between Blizzard games.

Players who purchase &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot; Collector&#x27;s or Digital Deluxe Edition receive an Orc themed card back in &quot;Hearthstone&quot;. &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; players who reach level 20 receive the Grave Golem battle pet in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and after reaching level 100 in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; receive an Ironside Dire Wolf mount in &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;. Starting on March 11, 2016, players who level a character to 20 in &quot;WoW&quot;, which can be completed with the free starter edition, earn the alternate Paladin hero Lady Liadrin in &quot;Hearthstone&quot;.

Players who buy &quot;Overwatch&quot; Origins, Game of the Year, or Collectors Edition are given the Baby Winston battle pet in &quot;WoW&quot;.

<text>The Curtiss A-12 Shrike was the United States Army Air Corps&#x27; second monoplane ground-attack aircraft, and its main attack aircraft through most of the 1930s. It was based on the A-8, but had a radial engine instead of the A-8&#x27;s inline, water-cooled engine, as well as other changes.

==Design and development==

The Model 60 was developed from advancements of the A-8 and the experimental YA-10. However, it became obsolete after a short use period, mainly because of fast-improving aviation technology, as well as the USAAC&#x27;s desire for multi-engined attack aircraft.

The most obvious difference between the A-12 and the A-8 is the air-cooled, radial engine in the A-12, which replaced the A-8&#x27;s inline, water-cooled engine. This was a response to the USAAC&#x27;s move toward a preference for radial engines, especially in attack aircraft. The rationale behind this preference is that the radial engine has a lower profile, making it less vulnerable to ground fire, and a simpler cooling mechanism, which is also less prone to groundfire, as well as overall maintenance problems.

These aircraft retained the open cockpit introduced in the A-8 production batch, and carried the same weapons load. In an attempt to improve pilot/observer co-operation, the rear cockpit was moved forward sufficiently for its glazed covering to form a continuation of the fuselage decking behind the pilot&#x27;s cockpit.

Nine USAAF A-12s were still in service at Hickam Field on 7 December 1941, but they saw no combat.

==Operational history==
On 15 August 1937, during the start of the Sino-Japanese War/World War II in the Battle of Shanghai, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched 45 planes from the fleet aircraft carrier &quot;Kaga&quot; targeting Chinese Air Force assets in the province of Jiangsu surrounding Shanghai; thirteen Aichi D1A1 dive-bombers were unable to find their intended target in Suzhou and so diverted to Jianqiao Airbase instead, but stumbled upon A-12 Shrikes of the 26th and 27th Squadrons of the 9th Attack Group at the Chao&#x27;er auxiliary airbase preparing for strikes against Japanese positions in Shanghai, and a dogfight ensued between two unlikely dogfighting opponents: two D1A1s were shot down by the Chinese A-12s, and another badly shot-up D1A1 returned to &quot;Kaga&quot; with a fatally wounded crewman.

A-12s served with the 3rd Attack Group plus the 8th and 18th Pursuit Groups. Surviving Shrikes were grounded just after Pearl Harbor was bombed in December 1941.

==Operators==
*Chinese Nationalist Air Force received 20 A-12 Shrikes in 1936, arming the 27th and the 28th Squadron of the 9th Group. When full-scale war broke out between Japan and China, they were used. The initial success including the downing of four Japanese Aichi D1A1 carrier-based dive bombers on 15 August 1937. However, after deploying in ground support missions in Shanxi, most did not survive and the few left were reassigned to training duties.

<doc id="379600" wikidata="Q652933" url="?curid=379600" title="United States House Select Committee on Assassinations">
<text>The United States House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) was established on September 15, 1976 by U.S. House Resolution 1540 to investigate the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 and 1968, respectively. The select committee was first formed by the 94th United States Congress, and expired at the end of the 95th Congress.

The HSCA completed its investigation in 1978 and issued its final report in 1979, which concluded that Kennedy “was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.” In addition to acoustic analysis of a police channel dictabelt recording, the HSCA also commissioned numerous other scientific studies of assassination-related evidence that corroborate the Warren Commission&#x27;s findings. However, the HSCA challenged the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the only shooter, while stating that it was “unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy.” The HSCA likewise concluded, based on circumstantial evidence, that there was a “likelihood” King was also assassinated “as a result of a conspiracy.” The two-year inquiry cost $5.8 million. In December 1978, the HSCA recommended that the Department of Justice review its findings to decide if further investigation was merited.

The HSCA found that although the Commission and the different agencies and departments examining Kennedy&#x27;s assassination performed in good faith and were thorough in their investigation of Oswald, they performed with “varying degrees of competency” and the search for possible conspiracy was inadequate. The HSCA determined, based on available evidence, that the probable conspiracy did not involve the governments of Cuba or the Soviet Union. The committee also stated that the conspiracy did not involve any organized crime group, anti-Castro group, nor the FBI, CIA, or Secret Service. The committee found that it could not exclude the possibility that individual members of the national syndicate of organized crime or anti-Castro Cubans were involved in a probable conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. However, some members of the committee would later state their personal belief that one of those groups was involved in the assassination, with Representative Floyd Fithian believing that the Kennedy assassination was orchestrated by members of organized crime.

In a memorandum written to the House Judiciary Committee in 1988 by Criminal Division Assistant Attorney General William F. Weld, the recommendations of the HSCA report were formally reviewed and a conclusion of active investigations was reported. In light of investigative reports from the FBI&#x27;s Technical Services Division and the National Academy of Sciences Committee determining that “reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman” in the Kennedy assassination, and that all investigative leads known to the Justice Department for both assassinations had been “exhaustively pursued”, the Department concluded “that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy in either the assassination of President Kennedy or the assassination of Dr. King.”

== Historic context ==
Several forces contributed to the formation of the HSCA. With the rapidly growing body of assassination conspiracy material, public trust in the findings of the Warren Commission report was declining. The Hart-Schweiker and Church Committee hearings had recently revealed CIA ties to other assassinations and assassination attempts and illegal actions from federal administration (FBI and IRS). The Church Commission also conducted an investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, concluding that the federal agencies the FBI and the CIA had failed in their duties and responsibilities and that the investigation into the assassination had been deficient.

There was also significant public interest after a video segment of the Zapruder film was first shown on TV on March 6, 1975, during the ABC late-night television show &quot;Good Night America&quot;, after being stored by &quot;Life&quot; magazine out of view for almost twelve years. The footage showed the president&#x27;s head recoiling violently backwards inside the presidential limousine during the fatal shooting as Lee Harvey Oswald was more than 80 yards behind. The public, having more and more difficulty accepting the conclusions of the Warren Commission report, led members of Congress to ask for new investigations into the assassination, within the framework of a new Commission of Inquiry.

== Formation ==
In September 1976, the United States House of Representatives voted 280–65 to establish the Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in order to investigate the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr..

The committee was both controversial and divided among itself. The first chairman, Thomas N. Downing of Virginia retired in January 1977 and was replaced by Henry B. Gonzalez on February 2, 1977. Gonzalez and Chief Counsel Richard A. Sprague had irreconcilable disagreements over control of the committee, budget and investigative techniques, ending with Gonzalez&#x27;s resignation. Sprague also resigned, in part to increase the chances of Congress voting to reconstitute the HSCA for the new two-year congressional term. Sprague&#x27;s like-minded deputy Robert K. Tanenbaum also resigned shortly thereafter. Louis Stokes replaced Gonzalez as chairman and G. Robert Blakey was appointed as Chief Counsel and Staff Director to replace Sprague.

==Investigations==
The HSCA commissioned a number of expert scientific studies to re-investigate the physical evidence of the JFK assassination. In comparison to witness testimony and government documents, the committee felt that such investigations would particularly benefit from the scientific advances of the fifteen years since the Warren Commission. Several lines of inquiry were followed to both reaffirm the single shooter/single-bullet theory as well as to disprove specific conspiracy theory allegations. The HSCA concluded that these scientific studies of assassination-related evidence do &quot;not preclude the possibility of two gunmen firing at the President.&quot;

===Ballistic analysis===
Forensic analysis confirmed that the mostly-intact stretcher bullet, bullet fragments from the presidential limo and the three cartridge casings from the sniper&#x27;s nest were all fired from Oswald&#x27;s rifle to the exclusion of all others. A technique using neutron activation analysis (NAA), a form of what has become known as comparative bullet-lead analysis (CBLA), was used to analyse the bullet lead from the JFK assassination. It revealed that it was highly likely that only two lead bullets were the source of all the following pieces of evidence: the mostly-intact stretcher bullet, fragments found in the presidential limousine&#x27;s front seat and rug, fragments recovered from JFK&#x27;s brain autopsy and fragments recovered from Governor Connally&#x27;s wrist. Whether CBLA data can be used to actually exclude the possibility that there were fragments from more than two bullets in the wounds and the car has been the subject of controversy. (See single bullet theory)

Additionally, the location of the shooter (at the 6th floor Texas School Book Depository window) was determined using trajectory analysis. The origin of the rifle bullets was calculated using the location of the presidential limousine and its occupants combined with the bullet wounds found on the president and governor.

===Photographic analysis===
A team of photographic experts were used to answer several questions related to the photographic evidence of the case. Forensic anthropologists as well as photographic and radiographic experts, based on unique anatomical details, verified that JFK&#x27;s autopsy photos and x-rays were only of the late president. Forensic anthropologists were also used to verify that all relevant photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald were of only one person. They verified that the backyard photos (showing Oswald holding the rifle used to kill the president) depicted the same rifle found in the Texas school book depository building after the crime. The panel of photographic experts were also used to verify the authenticity of the assassination-related photos and to analyze for any tampering or fakery; none was detected.

===Forensic Pathology Panel===
The HSCA&#x27;s Forensic Pathology Panel included Michael Baden, John I. Coe, Joseph H. Davis, George S. Loquvam, Charles S. Petty, Earl Rose, Werner Spitz, Cyril Wecht, and James T. Weston.

With the benefit of authenticated photographs, x-rays and notes from the Kennedy autopsy, a nine-doctor panel of expert pathologists reviewed and corroborated the Warren Commission&#x27;s medical findings. Although the HSCA medical panel was critical of the thoroughness and methodology of the original autopsy, they concurred, although Cyril Wecht dissented, with the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusion that two, and only two bullet wounds entered from above and behind (the direction of Oswald in the Book Depository). Their conclusion that the President was struck by a bullet that entered in the right rear of the head near the cowlick area and exited from the right front side of the head differed from a diagram in the Warren Commission&#x27;s report showing this entrance wound low in the back of the head.

===Fingerprint and handwriting analysis===
The authenticity of several fingerprints and a palm print found on assassination-related materials was reaffirmed by a fingerprint expert. Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s prints were found on the trigger guard and underside of the Mannlicher–Carcano rifle used to shoot the president, the brown paper container used to transport the rifle, several cardboard boxes in the sniper&#x27;s nest and on the magazine order form to purchase the rifle.

In addition, dozens of documents were analyzed by a panel of three handwriting experts who verified that &quot;the signatures and handwriting purported to be by Oswald are consistently that of one person.&quot; These include such incriminating items as the envelope and order form used to purchase the rifle, the application forms to rent the PO Box that the rifle was delivered to, and the notated backyard photo depicting Oswald holding the rifle.

=== Secret Services Actions analysis ===
The Department of Justice, the F.B.I, the C.I.A. and the Warren Commission were all criticized for the quality of the investigations carried out and for the way they informed the Warren Commission.

The Secret Services was criticized for the weak protection of the president, which was weakened between the parade in Houston on November 21 and Dallas on November 22, 1963. During the parade in Houston, the HSCA noted that 33 motorcyclists – including 6 on the flanks of the same presidential limousine- were deployed throughout the journey, which was not the case in Dallas 24 hours later. The HSCA reported that in its own report that : &quot;(104) The Secret Service&#x27;s alteration&#x27;s of the Dallas Police Department&#x27;s original motorcycle deployment plan prevented the use of maximum safety precautions.&quot;

===Dictabelt audio recording===

Although the HSCA had prepared a draft report confirming the Warren Commission&#x27;s single shooter theory and finding no evidence of conspiracy, at the eleventh hour, the committee was swayed by a since-disputed acoustic analysis of a dictabelt police channel recording. This acoustic analysis of the dictabelt recording by the firm Bolt, Beranek and Newman Inc. concluded that four shots were fired at the president, thus causing the HSCA to reverse its earlier position and report &quot;that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.&quot; In terms of scientific evidence, the HSCA acknowledged that the existence of a second shooter was only supported by this acoustic analysis.

As recommended by the HSCA, the Justice Department reviewed those findings through the FBI&#x27;s Technical Services Division and by contracting the National Academy of Sciences, which specially appointed the Committee on Ballistic Acoustics (CBA). Both the FBI and CBA analyzed the acoustic data and BBN&#x27;s scientific methodology and concluded that their findings were mistaken. Although there has been some recent back-and-forth between different researchers, the HSCA&#x27;s acoustic analysis is widely considered to be discredited.

== Witness auditions ==
Unlike the Warren Commission and the FBI who had concluded that there was a minor interest in their investigation of this aspect of the life of the former marine without digging further on the grounds that their investigation had not revealed the presence of Lee Harvey Oswald. at 544 Camp Street17, the HSCA revealed on the contrary several witnesses who confirmed the presence of Lee Harvey Oswald within the illegal branch of the CIA, including the brothers Allen and Daniel Campbell, former marines recruited by Guy Banister, his secretary Delphine Roberts or his own brother again.

In the address book of Lee Harvey Oswald was also found the coordinates of several notorious anti-Castroists.

The committee also found a connection between Lee Harvey Oswald and David Ferrie. The committee indicated that Lee Harvey Oswald and David Ferrie knew each other since 1955 and their actions in the civil air patrol.

The HSCA did not interview the personal physician of John F Kennedy, the doctor Georges Burkley who was never interviewed by the Warren Commission.

==Conclusions==
=== General conclusions ===
In particular, the various investigations performed by the U.S. government were faulted for insufficient consideration of the possibility of a conspiracy in each case. The committee in its report also made recommendations for legislative and administrative improvements, including making some assassinations Federal crimes.

===Conclusions regarding the King assassination===
On the King assassination, the committee concluded in its report that while King was killed by one rifle shot from James Earl Ray, &quot;there is a likelihood&quot; that it was the result of a conspiracy, and that no U.S. government agency was part of this conspiracy; on the contrary, it was more likely to be between Ray and his brothers.

===Conclusions regarding the Kennedy assassination===
On the Kennedy assassination, the HSCA concluded in its 1979 report that:
#Lee Harvey Oswald fired three shots at Kennedy. The second and third shots Oswald fired struck the President. The third shot he fired killed the President.
#Scientific acoustical evidence establishes a high probability that at least two gunmen fired at the President. Other scientific evidence does not preclude the possibility of two gunmen firing at the President. Scientific evidence negates some specific conspiracy allegations.
#The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. The committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy.
#* The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Soviet Government was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy.
#* The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Cuban Government was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy.
#* The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that anti-Castro Cuban groups, as groups, were not involved in the assassination of Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved.
#* The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the national syndicate of organized crime, as a group, was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved.
#* The Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Central Intelligence Agency were not involved in the assassination of Kennedy. 
#Agencies and departments of the U.S. Government performed with varying degrees of competency in the fulfillment of their duties. President Kennedy did not receive adequate protection. A thorough and reliable investigation into the responsibility of Lee Harvey Oswald for the assassination was conducted. The investigation into the possibility of conspiracy in the assassination was inadequate. The conclusions of the investigations were arrived at in good faith, but presented in a fashion that was too definitive.

The committee further concluded that it was probable that:
*four shots were fired
*the fourth shot came from a second assassin located on the grassy knoll, but missed. The HSCA concluded the existence and location of this alleged fourth shot based on the Dallas Police Department Dictabelt recording analysis, along with witness testimony that reported suspicious activity in the vicinity.:91

The HSCA agreed with the single bullet theory, but concluded that it occurred at a time point during the assassination that differed from any of the several time points the Warren Commission theorized it occurred.

The Department of Justice, FBI, CIA, and the Warren Commission were all criticized for not revealing to the Warren Commission information available in 1964, and the Secret Service was deemed deficient in their protection of the President.

The HSCA made several accusations of deficiency against the FBI and CIA as the Church Committee in 1976. The accusations encompassed organizational failures, miscommunication, and a desire to keep certain parts of their operations secret. Furthermore, the Warren Commission expected these agencies to be forthcoming with any information that would aid their investigation. But the FBI and CIA only saw it as their duty to respond to specific requests for information from the commission. However, the HSCA found the FBI and CIA were deficient in performing even that limited role.

==Criticisms==
Although the HSCA publicly released its findings in 12 volumes and a single-volume summary report, the majority of primary documents were sealed for 50 years under congressional rules. In 1992, Congress passed legislation to collect and open up all the evidence relating to Kennedy&#x27;s death, and created the Assassination Records Review Board to further that goal. No materials have been uncovered which significantly change the conclusions or opinion of the HSCA.

The ARRB reported: &quot;Because the HSCA investigation was marked by internal squabbling and disillusioned staffers, the committee&#x27;s records were the subject of ongoing controversy. Some ex-staffers claimed the HSCA report did not reflect their investigative work, and that information that did not conform with the committee leadership&#x27;s preconceived conclusions was ignored or left out of the report and supporting volumes.&quot;

In 1992, author Bonar Menninger dismissed the committee report as &quot;Blakey&#x27;s $5 Million Folly&quot;.

Robert Blakey, the chief counsel of the committee, later changed his views that the CIA was being cooperative and forthcoming with the investigation when he learned that the CIA&#x27;s special liaison to the committee researchers, George Joannides, was actually involved with some of the organizations that Lee Harvey Oswald was allegedly involved with in the months leading up to the assassination. Among these organizations was an anti-Castro group, the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil, which was linked to the CIA (Joannides was in fact working for the CIA in 1963). Chief Counsel Blakey later stated that Joannides should have in fact been interviewed by the HCSA, rather than serving as a gatekeeper to the CIA&#x27;s evidence and files regarding the assassination. He further disregarded and suspected all the CIA&#x27;s statements and representations to the committee, accusing it of obstruction of justice.

In the same 2003 interview, Blakey issued a statement on the Central Intelligence Agency:

...I no longer believe that we were able to conduct an appropriate investigation of the [Central Intelligence] Agency and its relationship to Oswald... We now know that the Agency withheld from the Warren Commission the CIA–Mafia plots to kill Castro. Had the commission known of the plots, it would have followed a different path in its investigation. The Agency unilaterally deprived the commission of a chance to obtain the full truth, which will now never be known. Significantly, the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusion that the agencies of the government co-operated with it is, in retrospect, not the truth. We also now know that the Agency set up a process that could only have been designed to frustrate the ability of the committee in 1976–79 to obtain any information that might adversely affect the Agency. Many have told me that the culture of the Agency is one of prevarication and dissimulation and that you cannot trust it or its people. Period. End of story. I am now in that camp.

According to a 2015 &quot;Politico&quot; report, newly declassified documents show that CIA director John A. McCone hid evidence from the Warren Commission. According to a once-secret report written in 2013 by the CIA&#x27;s top in-house historian, David Robarge, the CIA admits McCone and other senior CIA officials withheld &#x27;incendiary&#x27; information from the Warren Commission.

<text>The Lumbricidae are a family of earthworms. About 33 lumbricid species have become naturalized around the world, but the bulk of the species are in the Holarctic region: from Canada (e.g. &quot;Bimastos lawrenceae&quot; on Vancouver Island) and the United States (e.g. &quot;Eisenoides carolinensis&quot;, &quot;Eisenoides lonnbergi&quot; and most &quot;Bimastos&quot; spp.) and throughout Eurasia to Japan (e.g. &quot;Eisenia japonica&quot;, &quot;E. koreana&quot; and &quot;Helodrilus hachiojii&quot;). An enigmatic species in Tasmania is &quot;Eophila eti&quot;. Currently, 670 valid species and subspecies in about 42 genera are recognized. This family includes the majority of earthworm species well known in Europe and Asia.

==Genera==
The family consists of the following genera:
* &quot;Allolobophora&quot; 
* &quot;Alpodinaridella&quot; 
* &quot;Aporrectodea&quot; 
* &quot;Bimastos&quot; 
* Castellodrilus stat. nov.

* &quot;Eumenescolex&quot; 
* &quot;Fitzingeria&quot; 
* &quot;Flabellodrilus&quot; 
* &quot;Gatesona&quot; 
* &quot;Healyella&quot;

* &quot;Octodrilus&quot; 
* &quot;Octolasion&quot; 
* &quot;Octolasium&quot; 
* &quot;Omilurus&quot; 
* &quot;Orodrilus&quot; 
* &quot;Perelia&quot; 
* &quot;Philomontanus&quot; 
* &quot;Pietromodeona&quot; 
* &quot;Postandrilus&quot; 
* &quot;Proctodrilus&quot; 
* &quot;Prosellodrilus&quot; 
* &quot;Reynoldsia&quot; 
* &quot;Satchellius&quot; 
* &quot;Scherotheca&quot; 
* &quot;Spermophorodrilus&quot; 
* &quot;Tetragonurus&quot; Preoccupied by a genus of fish: &quot;Tetragonurus&quot; . &quot;Tetragonurus&quot; is a junior homonym, now accepted as &quot;Eiseniella&quot;

== Range ==
The worms in the family Lumbricidae originate from Europe, but over time members of the family have since been introduced and spread around the globe.

=== Europe ===
Members of Lumbricidae are native to Europe and are most diverse in southern Europe. There are 30 species from the family in Ireland and Britain. Notably, a single mature individual of the species &quot;Prosellodrilus amplisetosus&quot; was found in a survey of soil biodiversity in Ireland. &quot;P. amplisetosis&quot; had never been recorded in Ireland before and is commonly found in France or Spain. It is thought to have been introduced by humans through agricultural supplies. Another interesting case is of the species &quot;Dendrobaena attemsi&quot; in Scandinavia. They were first found in a national park in Sweden, the furthest north the species have been found. The discovery of &quot;D. attemsi&quot; implies the range of the species is increasing north. It is not only in Sweden that species of Lumbricidae are expanding their range. Many of the species found in Finland are exhibiting similar increases in range and Lumbricidae worms are also expanding into Northeastern Europe, starting from the near Baltic sea.

A 2022 molecular phylogenetic study of the highly diverse Franco-Iberian genus &quot;Zophoscolex&quot; showed most of the Iberian species to form a distinct clade, formally described as Castellodrilus stat. nov.. Other species were moved to the genera &quot;Cataladrilus&quot; and &quot;Compostelandrilus&quot;, with the remaining species remaining in &quot;Zophoscolex&quot; restricted to French representatives.

=== Asia ===
Lumbricidae make up the majority of earthworms found in China, despite not being native to the area.

At higher elevations in India, some species of Lumbicidae can be found.

=== North America ===
When European settlers came to North America, so did European earthworms like the Lumbricidae. Before this, the area in North America where glaciers had been were mostly worm-free. Lumbricidae worms are known to be expanding into the Great Lakes region. The introduced worms have an impact on the native species and environments. Species from the family, such as &quot;Lumbricus rubelles,&quot; are believed to have displaced the local species in a number of regions. In others, Lumbricidae species outnumber the native species in terms of biomass. Despite this, they are not as productive, in terms of processing nitrogen and phosphorus, as the native species. Lumbricidae worms also tend to have a higher species richness than native North American worms, though the species richness of both the native and Lumbricidae decreases with increasing latitudes.

=== New Zealand and Australia ===
Similar to North America, worms from the family were introduced to New Zealand and Australia by European settlers.

== Predators ==
Harvestmen, especially from the genera &quot;Leiobunum&quot; and &quot;Hadrobunus&quot;, are known to consume Lumbricidae earthworms. This happens mostly in temperate regions. Another species known to prey on Lumbricidae is the Bannan caecilian. Lumbricidae are an important part of its diet.

<text>General Sir Gordon Drummond, GCB (27 September 1772 – 10 October 1854) was a Canadian-born British Army officer and the first official to command the military and the civil government of Canada. As Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Drummond distinguished himself on the Niagara front in the War of 1812 and later became Governor-General and Administrator of Canada.

==Early years==

Gordon Drummond was born in Quebec City on 27 September 1772. He was of Scottish descent, the son of Colin Drummond (1722–1776), of Megginch Castle, Perthshire, and his wife Catherine Oliphant of Rossie. His sister, Elizabeth married Lord Hervey, one brother, John Drummond married a daughter of John Fane, 9th Earl of Westmorland and another brother, Vice-Admiral Sir Adam Drummond, KCH, married Lady Charlotte Murray, eldest daughter of John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl.

Gordon&#x27;s father first came to Lower Canada in 1764 as the Quebec agent to the London firm of Sir Samuel Fludyer, Adam Drummond (his brother) &amp; Franks, contractors for victualling the troops in North America. At Quebec, Colin Drummond became a business partner of Jacob Jordan and served as Commissary General, deputy Paymaster General to the Forces in the Province of Quebec and Legislative Councillor. Gordon was three years old when Quebec City was unsuccessfully sieged by American forces in 1775. Four years after Colin Drummond&#x27;s death, in 1780 the family left Quebec and Gordon received his education at Westminster School in England before entering the British Army as an ensign with the 1st Foot in 1789.

In 1794, he served as a junior lieutenant-colonel in the Netherlands, commanded by the Duke of York. At the siege of Nijmegen Drummond was commended in the successful repelling of a French sortie. In 1801 Drummond led the 8th Regiment of Foot ashore at the Battle of Abukir and fought in a number of engagements in Egypt including the Battle of Alexandria and the Capture of Cairo. He also saw service in the Mediterranean and the West Indies. In 1805, at the age of 33 years, Drummond had attained the rank of major general.

==War of 1812==
Drummond first came back to Canada in 1809 on the staff of Governor General Sir James Henry Craig. After briefly serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Canadas in 1811, as a result of Craig being recalled to England, Drummond was reassigned to Ulster. Late in 1813, Drummond was recalled to North America to serve in Upper Canada as lieutenant governor, replacing Francis de Rottenburg. Rottenburg had proven an unpopular officer who was considered over-cautious, nervous about any sort of engagement, and reluctant to send reinforcements to vital areas. Successive lieutenant governors—Rottenburg and his predecessor, Roger Hale Sheaffe—had failed to make an impact in the North American war since the death of the successful Sir Isaac Brock at the Battle of Queenston Heights.

Drummond soon proved himself in Brock&#x27;s mould: aggressive and willing to take chances, and in December Drummond launched a surprise attack which led to the capture of Fort Niagara. After the American burning of Newark Drummond crossed the Niagara River, fought the Battle of Black Rock and burned Buffalo in retaliation. The involvement of Canadian defectors in the destruction of Newark outraged the population of Upper Canada. Acting Attorney-General John Beverley Robinson convinced Drummond, in his role of Lieutenant Governor, to put forward legislation to make it easier to prosecute treason.

In May 1814, fifteen prisoners were convicted of high treason and sentenced to death by a special court convened by Robinson and presided over by Chief Justice Thomas Scott. Drummond, as acting Lieutenant Governor, was pressured by Robinson to allow the sentences to be carried out. Eight were hanged at Burlington Heights on 20 July 1814 while the rest had their sentences reduced to exile. At the time of the executions, Drummond was on route from Kingston to Niagara to take over field command of the army.

Drummond, like Brock and Henry Procter, was continually hungry for reinforcements from the governor general, Sir George Prevost, who held relatively large numbers of troops in reserve at Quebec, despite the fact that no enemy had even come close to endangering the capital. Despite a constant lack of manpower and war material, Drummond had all but driven the American forces from the Niagara by the close of the 1813–1814 winter campaign. In July 1814, responding to a request from the beleaguered Major-General Phineas Riall, Drummond went with his troops from York to Fort George to take command from Riall and drive back Jacob Brown&#x27;s invading soldiers. On 25 July, he ordered an immediate attack on the American forces, which were already engaging Riall&#x27;s troops near Chippawa. In this way, a small skirmish exploded into the bloody and inconclusive Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane, which cost each side over 850 casualties and left the British in possession of the road, although it is uncertain whether the British drove the Americans from the field, or the Americans drove off the British and were simply forced to withdraw by a lack of supplies. The latter is likely the case, based upon evidence compiled by Donald Graves, a Canadian historian employed at the Directorate of History, Department of National Defence Canada.

At Lundy&#x27;s Lane, Drummond suffered a serious wound from a shot to the neck during the battle and Riall was captured by American forces. Nonetheless, Drummond insisted that Lundy&#x27;s Lane was a total victory, and tried to smash Brown&#x27;s army into the ground by chasing them to Fort Erie. An attempt to storm the fort on 14 August was a failure, partially due to the unfortunate explosion of the fort&#x27;s magazine that wiped out an entire arm of his attack force. The casualties from the one attack numbered over 900, greater than one-third of his army. Drummond&#x27;s cousin, Lieutenant Colonel William Drummond, was killed during the attack.

Drummond was forced by the capture of Riall and injury or illness of several of his other senior officers to superintend every detail of the operations against Fort Erie, in addition to his other duties as Lieutenant Governor. In September, when shortage of supplies and exposure to bad weather made it already inevitable that the siege would fail, Drummond was taken by surprise by an American sortie from the fortress, which destroyed two out of the three siege batteries and inflicted heavy casualties. As a result, Drummond was forced to abandon the siege of Fort Erie and withdraw to Chippawa.

He regained some face from his defeat when in November that same year the Americans, suffering severe food shortages, withdrew from Fort Erie and allowed what remained of Drummond&#x27;s army to secure the frontier. However, the summer of 1814 was Drummond&#x27;s last major military campaign. The arrival of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s veterans after the first defeat of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte allowed the British to launch an offensive into the United States during the summer and autumn months of 1814, but it was Prevost, de Rottenburg, and some of Wellington&#x27;s officers that led that attack as Wellington remained behind in England.

==Postwar and return to England==
In early 1815, following the ending of all hostilities, Drummond remained in Upper Canada as Lieutenant-Governor, and when Prevost was recalled to Britain, he took over as Governor-General and Administrator of Canada in Quebec City. At the opening of the session of the legislature, the House of Assembly of Lower Canada (Quebec) welcomed him as a son of the province and war hero. Drummond responded to the members of the house that it was his honour to fight &quot;in the defence of this my native country&quot;. Aside from helping establish the peace laid down by the Treaty of Ghent, his post-war career in Canada as a civil administrator focused on military settlements and Indigenous affairs. Drummond fought to secure a pension for Mohawk Chief Teyoninhokarawen (John Norton) whom he described as &quot;of the coolest and most undaunted courage.&quot;

As Commander of the Forces, Drummond restricted the use of the punishment of flogging in the army and offered a general amnesty to deserters. To show his respect for the troops that served under him, Drummond successfully secured the battle honour of NIAGARA for British and Canadian regular regiments that fought at Fort Niagara, Lundy&#x27;s Lane and Fort Erie. For the widows and orphans of soldiers, Drummond donated all his prize money from the war.

Shortly after his return to England, Drummond on 1 July 1816 was raised to Knight Commander of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, the first Canadian to receive this honour. The investment ceremony was conducted by both the Prince Regent and Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army. In 1825, Drummond was promoted to full general, and twenty years later became the most senior general in the British Army. Despite his knighthood and promotion as well as his continuing active duty status, he never saw action in battle again.

He was appointed colonel of the 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) on 3 November 1819, transferring to the 71st Regiment of Foot on 16 January 1824. On 21 September 1829 he transferred again to the 49th Regiment of Foot and on 24 April 1846 to the 8th (The Kings) Regiment of Foot, serving in that capacity to his death.

Sir Gordon Drummond died on 10 October 1854 at his home in London at age 82.

==Legacy==
Places named in honour of Sir Gordon Drummond include the following:

*Drummondville, Quebec
*Drummond Regional County Municipality, Quebec
*Drummond Island, Michigan
*Drummond Township, Michigan.
*Drummond Township, Lanark County, Ontario
*Drummond Street, Downtown Toronto, Ontario
*Drummond Road, Niagara Falls, Ontario
*Drummondville, Ontario - a former village, incorporated in 1831 near the site of the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane, and now a part of Niagara Falls, Ontario

The town of Perth, Ontario, was named after Drummond&#x27;s ancestral home of Perth, Scotland, in his honour and also has a Drummond Street.

Drummond Street, Montreal, Quebec, is named after Jane Drummond (no relation), the second wife of John Redpath, not after Gordon Drummond, as is sometimes thought.

==Family==
In 1807, Drummond married Margaret Russell, daughter of William Russell (1734–1817) of Brancepeth Castle. They had two sons and a daughter:

* Gordon Drummond, colonel of the Coldstream Guards. He served at the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855), and died at Durham on 17 November 1856.
* William Russell Drummond R.N. (died 1835). His death occurred at Callao, Peru, while he was serving on HMS &quot;Satellite&quot;. It was connected with a mutiny there. A somewhat muddled account is in the memoirs of Crawford Pasco, who writes that the mutineers were supporters of the exiled Chilean Ramón Freire. In fact they declared in favour of Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente, just arrived in the port, against Luis José de Orbegoso.
* Eliza, married Henry Howard, 2nd Earl of Effingham.
