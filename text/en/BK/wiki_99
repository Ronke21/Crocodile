<text>The interurban (or radial railway in Canada) is a type of electric railway, with tram-like electric self-propelled railcars which run within and between cities or towns. The term &quot;interurban&quot; is usually used in North America, with other terms used outside it. They were very prevalent in many parts of the world before the Second World War and were used primarily for passenger travel between cities and their surrounding suburban and rural communities. Interurban as a term encompassed the companies, their infrastructure, their cars that ran on the rails, and their service. In the United States, the early 1900s interurban was a valuable economic institution, when most roads between towns, many town streets were unpaved, and transportation and haulage was by horse-drawn carriages and carts.

The interurban provided reliable transportation, particularly in winter weather, between towns and countryside. In 1915, of interurban railways were operating in the United States and, for a few years, interurban railways, including the numerous manufacturers of cars and equipment, were the fifth-largest industry in the country. But due to preference given to automobiles, by 1930, most interurbans in North America had stopped operating. A few survived into the 1950s.

Outside of the US, other countries built large networks of high-speed electric tramways that survive today. Notable systems exist in the Low Countries, Poland and Japan, where populations are densely packed around large conurbations such as the Randstad, Upper Silesia, Greater Tokyo Area and Keihanshin. Switzerland, particularly, has a large network of mountain narrow-gauge interurban lines.

In addition, since the early 21st century many tram-train lines are being built, especially in France and Germany but also elsewhere in the world. These can be regarded as interurbans since they run on the streets, like trams, when in cities, while out of them they either share existing railway lines or use lines that were abandoned by the railway companies.

== Definition ==

The term &quot;interurban&quot; was coined by Charles L. Henry, a state senator in Indiana. The Latin, , means &quot;between cities&quot;. The interurban fit on a continuum between urban street railways and full-fledged railroads. George W. Hilton and John F. Due identified four characteristics of an interurban:

* Electric power for propulsion.
* Passenger service as the primary business.
* Equipment heavier and faster than urban streetcars.
* Operation on tracks in city streets, and in rural areas on roadside tracks or private rights-of-way.

The definition of &quot;interurban&quot; is necessarily blurry. Some town streetcar lines evolved into interurban systems by extending streetcar track from town into the countryside to link adjacent towns together and sometimes by the acquisition of a nearby interurban system. Following initial construction, there was a large amount of consolidation of lines. Other interurban lines effectively became light rail systems with no street running whatsoever, or they became primarily freight-hauling railroads because of a progressive loss of their initial passenger service over the years.

In 1905, the United States Census Bureau defined an interurban as &quot;a street railway having more than half its trackage outside municipal limits.&quot; It drew a distinction between &quot;interurban&quot; and &quot;suburban&quot; railroads. A suburban system was oriented toward a city center in a single urban area and served commuter traffic. A regular railroad moved riders from one city center to another city center and also moved a substantial amount of freight.

The typical interurban similarly served more than one city, but it served a smaller region and made more frequent stops, and it was oriented to passenger rather than freight service.

==History==
=== Emergence ===

==== USA ====

The development of interurbans in the late nineteenth century resulted from the convergence of two trends: improvements in electric traction, and an untapped demand for transportation in rural areas, particularly in the Midwestern United States. The 1880s saw the first successful deployments of electric traction in streetcar systems. Most of these built on the pioneering work of Frank J. Sprague, who developed an improved method for mounting an electric traction motor and using a trolley pole for pickup. Sprague&#x27;s work led to widespread acceptance of electric traction for streetcar operations and end of horse-drawn trams.

The late nineteenth-century United States witnessed a boom in agriculture which lasted through the First World War, but transportation in rural areas was inadequate. Conventional steam railroads made limited stops, mostly in towns. These were supplemented by horse and buggies and steamboats, both of which were slow and the latter of which were restricted to navigable rivers. The increased capacity and profitability of the city street railroads offered the possibility of extending them into the countryside to reach new markets, even linking to other towns. The first interurban to emerge in the United States was the Newark and Granville Street Railway in Ohio, which opened in 1889. It was not a major success, but others followed. The development of the automobile was then in its infancy, and to many investors interurbans appeared to be the future of local transportation.
From 1900 to 1916, large networks of interurban lines were constructed across the United States, particularly in the states of Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Iowa, Utah, and California. In 1900, of interurban track existed, but by 1916, this had increased to , a seven-fold expansion. At one point in time beginning in 1901, it was possible to travel from Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, to Little Falls, New York, exclusively by interurban. During this expansion, in the regions where they operated, particularly in Ohio and Indiana, &quot;...they almost destroyed the local passenger service of the steam railroad.&quot; To show how exceptionally busy the interurbans radiating from Indianapolis were in 1926, the immense Indianapolis Traction Terminal (nine roof covered tracks and loading platforms) scheduled 500 trains in and out daily and moved 7 million passengers that year. At their peak the interurbans were the fifth-largest industry in the United States.

==== Europe ====
In Belgium, a sprawling, nation-wide system of narrow-gauge vicinal tramways have been built by the NMVB / SNCV to provide transport to smaller towns across the country; the first section opened in 1885. These lines were either electrically operated or run with diesel tramcars, included numerous street-running sections, and inter-operated with local tram networks in the larger cities. Similar to Belgium, Netherlands constructed a large network of interurbans in the early 1900s called streektramlijnen.

In Silesia, today Poland, an extensive interurban system was constructed, starting in 1894 with a narrow-gauge line connecting Gliwice with Piekary Śląskie through Zabrze, Chebzie, Chorzów and Bytom, another connected Katowice and Siemianowice. After four years, in 1898, Kramer &amp; Co. was chosen to start electrification on Katowice Rynek (Kattowitz, Ring) - Zawodzie line, after which Schikora &amp; Wolff completed electrification of four additional lines. In 1912, the first short line was built in Katowice. In 1913, a separate standard gauge system connecting Bytom with suburbs and villages west of the town was launched. After World War I and the Silesian Uprisings, in 1922 the region (and the tram network) was divided between newly independent Poland and Germany, and international services appeared (the last one ran until 1937). In 1928 further standard gauge systems were established in Sosnowiec, Będzin and Dąbrowa Górnicza (the so-called Dabrowa Coal Basin - a region adjoining the Upper Silesian Coal Basin). Between 1928 and 1936 most of the original narrow gauge network was converted to standard, which allowed a connection with the new system in Sosnowiec. By 1931, 47,5% of the narrow-gauge network was reconstructed, with of new standard-gauge track built.

A large network of interurbans started developing around Milan in the late 1800s; they were originally drawn by horses and later powered as steam trams. These initial interurban lines were gradually upgraded with electric traction in the early 1900s with some assistance from Thomas Edison. By the 1930s a vast network of interurbans, the &quot;Società Trazione Elettrica Lombarda&quot;, connected Milan with surrounding towns.

In the first half of the 20th century, an extensive tramway network covered Northern England, centered on South Lancashire and West Yorkshire. At that time, it was possible to travel entirely by tram from Liverpool Pier Head to the village of Summit, outside Rochdale, a distance of , and with a short bus journey across the Pennines, to connect to another tram network that linked Huddersfield, Halifax and Leeds.

==== Asia ====

The first interurban railway in Japan is the Hanshin Electric Railway, built to compete with mainline steam trains on the Osaka to Kobe corridor and completed in 1905. As laws of that time did not allow parallel railways to be built, the line was legally defined as a tramway and included street running at the two ends, but was based on American interurbans and operated with large tramcars on mostly private right-of-way. In the same year, the Keihin Express Railway, or Keikyu, completed a section of what is today part of the Keikyū Main Line between Shinagawa, Tokyo and Kanagawa, Yokohama. This line competes with mainline Japanese National Railways on this busy corridor. Predecessors of the Meitetsu opened their first interurban lines in 1912, what today form parts of the Meitetsu Inuyama Line and Tsushima Line. In 1913, the first section of what will become the Keiō Line opened connecting Chōfu to just outside Shinjuku with street running on what is today the Kōshū Kaidō or National Route 20. Kyushu Electric Railroad, predecessor to Nishitetsu opened its first interurban line in 1914 serving Kitakyushu and surrounding areas, taking heavy inspiration from Hanshin Electric Railway.

=== Diverging fortunes ===
==== Decline in North America ====
The fortunes of the industry in the US and Canada declined during World War I, particularly into the early 1920s. In 1919 President Woodrow Wilson created the Federal Electric Railways Commission to investigate the financial problems of the industry. The commission submitted its final report to the President in 1920. The commission&#x27;s report focused on financial management problems and external economic pressures on the industry, and recommended against introducing public financing for the interurban industry. One of the commission&#x27;s consultants, however, published an independent report stating that private ownership of electric railways had been a failure, and only public ownership would keep the interurbans in business.

Many interurbans had been hastily constructed without realistic projections of income and expenses. They were initially financed by issuing stock and selling bonds. The sale of these financial instruments was often local with salesmen going door to door aggressively pushing this new and exciting &quot;it can&#x27;t fail&quot; form of transportation. But many of those interurbans did fail, and often quickly. They had poor cash flow from the outset and struggled to raise essential further capital. Interurbans were very vulnerable to acts of nature damaging track and bridges, particularly in the Midwestern United States where flooding was common. Receivership was a common fate when the interurban company could not pay its payroll and other debts, so state courts took over and allowed continued operation while suspending the company&#x27;s obligation to pay interest on its bonds. In addition, the interurban honeymoon period with the municipalities of 1895–1910 was over.

The large and heavy interurbans, some weighing as much as 65 tons, caused damage to city streets which led to endless disputes over who should bear the repair costs. The rise of private automobile traffic in the middle 1920s aggravated such trends. As the interurban companies struggled financially, they faced rising competition from cars and trucks on newly paved streets and highways, while municipalities sought to alleviate traffic congestion by removing interurbans from city streets. Some companies exited the passenger business altogether to focus on freight, while others sought to buttress their finances by selling surplus electricity in local communities. Several interurbans that attempted to exit the rail business altogether ran afoul of state commissions which required that trains remain running &quot;for the public good&quot;, even at a loss.

Many financially weak interurbans did not survive the prosperous 1920s, and most others went bankrupt during the Great Depression. A few struggling lines tried combining to form much larger systems in an attempt to gain operating efficiency and a broader customer base. This occurred in Ohio in year 1930 with the long Cincinnati &amp; Lake Erie Railroad (C&amp;LE), and in Indiana with the very widespread Indiana Railroad. Both had limited success up to 1937–1938 and primarily earned growing revenues from freight rather than passengers. The long Sacramento Northern Railway stopped carrying passengers in 1940 but continued hauling freight into the 1960s by using heavy electric locomotives.

Oliver Jensen, author of &quot;American Heritage History of Railroads in America&quot;, commented that &quot;...the automobile doomed the interurban whose private tax paying tracks could never compete with the highways that a generous government provided for the motorist.&quot; William D. Middleton, in the opening of his 1961 book &quot;The Interurban Era&quot;, wrote: 

Interurban business increased during World War II due to fuel oil rationing and large wartime employment. When the war ended in 1945, riders went back to their automobiles, and most of these lines were finally abandoned. Several systems struggled into the 1950s, including the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad (passenger service ended 1950), Lehigh Valley Transit Company (1951), West Penn Railways (1952), and the Illinois Terminal Railroad (1958). The West Penn was the largest interurban to operate in the east at and had provided Pittsburgh-area coal country towns with hourly transportation since 1888.

By the 1960s only five remaining interurban lines served commuters in three major metropolitan areas: the North Shore Line and the South Shore Line in Chicago, the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company, the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway in northern New Jersey, and the Long Beach Line in Long Beach and Los Angeles, California (this was the last remaining part of the Pacific Electric system). The Long Beach Line was cut in 1961, the North Shore Line in 1963; the Philadelphia Suburban&#x27;s route 103 and the NYS&amp;W in New Jersey both ended passenger service in 1966. Today, only the South Shore Line, Norristown High Speed Line (SEPTA Route 100), and SEPTA Routes 101/102 remain.

Some former interurban lines retained freight service for up to several decades after the discontinuance of passenger service. Most were converted to diesel operation, although the Sacramento Northern Railway retained electric freight until 1965.

==== Consolidation in Europe ====
After World War II, many interurbans in other countries were also cut back. In Belgium, as intercity transport shifted to cars and buses; the large sections of the vicinal tramways were gradually shut down by the 1980s. At their peak in 1945, the mileage of vicinal tramways reached and exceeded the length of the national railway network.
Sprawling tram networks in the Netherlands extended to neighbouring cities. The vast majority of these lines were not electrified and operated with steam and sometimes petrol or diesel tramcars. Many did not survive the 1920s and 30s for the same reasons American interurbans went bust, but those that did were put back into service during the war years, or at least the remaining parts not yet demolished. One of the largest systems, nicknamed the Blue Tram, was run by the Noord-Zuid-Hollandsche Stoomtramweg-Maatschappij and survived until 1961. Another, the RTM (Rotterdamse Tramweg Maatschappij), which ran in the river delta south-west of Rotterdam, survived until early January 1966. Its demise sparked the rail-related heritage movement in the Netherlands in earnest with the founding of the Tramweg Stichting (Tramway Foundation). Many systems, such as the Hague tramway and the Rotterdam tramway, included long interurban extensions which were operated with larger, higher-speed cars. In close parallel to North America, many systems were abandoned from the 1950s after tram companies switched to buses.

Instigated by the oil crisis in the 1970s, the remaining interurban tramways have enjoyed somewhat of a renaissance in the form of the Sneltram, a modern light rail system that uses high floor, metro-style vehicles and could interoperate into metro networks. Various other interurbans in Europe were folded into local municipal tramway or light rail systems. Switzerland retained many of its interurban lines which now operate as tramways, local railways, S-Bahn, or tram-trains. Milan&#x27;s vast interurban network was progressively closed in the 1970s but parts of it were reused as the outer parts of the Milan Metro.

==== Evolution in Japan ====

Development of Japanese interurbans strayed from their American counterparts from the 1920s. The second boom of interurbans occurred as late as the 1920s and 1930s in Japan, with predecessors of the extensive Kintetsu Railway, Hankyu, Nankai Electric Railway and Odakyu Electric Railway networks starting life during this period. These interurbans, built with straighter tracks, electrified at 1500V and operated using larger cars, were built to even higher standards than the Japanese National Railways network at the time. The (former JNR) Hanwa Line was a wartime acquisition from Nankai, operating &#x27;Super Express&#x27; trains on the line at an average speed of , a national record at the time. The old Sendai station terminus of the Miyagi Electric Railway (the predecessor of the JR Senseki Line) was situated in a short single-track underground tunnel built in 1925; this was the first stretch of underground railway in all of Asia, predating the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line by two years. Meanwhile, existing interurbans like the Hanshin Electric Railway started to rebuild their street-running lines into grade-separated exclusive rights-of-way.

After the war, interurbans and other private railway companies received large investments and were allowed to compete not only with mainline trains but also with each other, in order to rejuvenate the country&#x27;s railway infrastructure and cater to the post-war baby boom. The companies continued their policies of improvement they had followed before the war; lines were reconstructed to allow higher speeds, mainline-sized trains were adopted, street-running sections were rebuilt to elevated or underground rights-of-way, and link lines to growing metro systems were built to allow for through operations. Many of these private railway companies started to adopt standards for full-blown heavy rail lines similar to the national rail network, and, like JR commuter routes, are operated as &#x27;metro-style&#x27; commuter railways with mainline-sized vehicles and metro-like frequencies of very few minutes. In 1957, the Odakyu Electric Railway introduced the Odakyu 3000 series SE, the first in a line of luxurious tourist Limited Express trains named &#x27;Romancecars&#x27;. These units set a narrow-gauge speed record of on its runs to the mountain spa resort of Hakone.

Many private lines were nationalised during the Second World War. The handful that remained in the hands of JNR after the end of the war – including the Hanwa Line, Senseki Line and the Iida Line – remain outliers on the national JR network, with short station distances, (in the case of the Iida Line) lower-grade infrastructure, and independent termini (such as Aobadori Station and the upper level of Tennōji Station).
Today, trackage of the major sixteen private railways, in many places originally designed as American-style interurban railways, has been upgraded beyond recognition into high capacity urban heavy railways. Private railway companies that started out as interurbans such as Tokyu, Seibu, Odakyu, Hankyu and Tobu; rail transportation now tends to form only a small part of their extensive business empires, which often include real estate, hotels and resorts, and tourist attractions. For example, the Keikyu network has changed unrecognizably from its early days, operating Limited Express services at up to to compete with JR trains, and inter-operating with subway and Keisei Electric Railway trains on through runs extending up to ; the trains retain a red livery based on the Pacific Electric&#x27;s &#x27;Red Cars&#x27;, true to the company&#x27;s interurban roots. The Keiō Line did not fully remove the street running section on the Kōshū Kaidō outside of Shinjuku Station until the 1960s, replacing it with an underground section.

Similar to passenger railway conditions in early 1900s America, intense competition still exists today between private railways and mainline railways operated by the Japan Railways Group along highly congested corridors is a hallmark of suburban railway operations in Japan. For example, on the Osaka to Kobe corridor, JR West competes intensely with both Hankyu Kobe Line and Hanshin Main Line trains in terms of speed, convenience and comfort.
However, a number of urban lines in Japan did close as late as the 2000s, with networks in Kitakyushu and Gifu being shut down.

== Today ==
===Austria===
Between Vienna and Baden bei Wien the Badner Bahn, operates a classic interurban passenger service, in addition to some freight services. Some interurban lines survive today a local railways in Upper Austria are such as the Linzer Lokalbahn, Lokalbahn Vöcklamarkt–Attersee and Lokalbahn Lambach–Vorchdorf-Eggenberg. While others operate as extension of as local city tramways such as the Traunseebahn which is now connected to the Gmunden Tramway.

=== Belgium ===
Today, two surviving interurban networks descending from the vicinal tramways exist in Belgium. The famous Belgian Coast Tram, built in 1885, traverses the entire Belgian coastline and, at a length of , which is the longest tram line in the world. The Charleroi Metro is a never fully completed pre-metro network upgraded and developed from the dense vicinal tramway network around the city.

=== Canada ===
Similar to the United States, in Canada most passenger interurbans were removed by the 1950s. One example of continuous passenger service still exists today, the Toronto Transit Commission 501 Queen streetcar line. The western segment of the 501 Streetcar operates largely on what was the T&amp;YRR Port Credit Radial Line, a radial line that remains intact through Etobicoke and up to the border of the neighbouring City of Mississauga, unlike other Toronto radial lines which were all abandoned outside of the 1960s boundary of the City of Toronto.
===Germany===
In Germany various networks have continued to operate. Karlsruhe revitalized the interurban concept into the Karlsruhe model by renovating two local railways Alb Valley Railway, which already had interoperability with local tram trackage, and the Hardt Railway. Other examples include:

* Interurban tram routes serving Mannheim, Heidelberg, Weinheim (Route 5) and Bad Dürkheim (Route 4) as part of the Mannheim/Ludwigshafen Tram System.
* Various interurbans upgraded as part of the Rhine-Ruhr Stadtbahn system such as Düsseldorf to Krefeld (U76) and Duisburg (U79), Bochum/Gelsenkirchen (Route 302), Mülheim to Essen and Essen to Gelsenkirchen (Route 107).
* interurban route between Cologne to Bonn (Route 16)

=== Italy ===
Milan operates one remaining interurban tramway to Limbiate with another interurban route to Carate Brianza/Giussano suspended since 2011. These two lines were once part of large network of interurbans surrounding Milan that were gradually closed in the 1970s.
As of February 2025, the line to Carate has been being rebuilt since 2023, mostly along the original alignment, up to Seregno railway station. 
The line to Limbiate has benn closed since 2022, with similar plans of rebuilding it up to more modern standards. 

===Japan ===
In Japan, the vast majority of the major sixteen private railways have roots as interurban electric railway lines that were inspired by the US. But instead of demolishing their trackage in the 1930s, many Japanese interurbans companies upgraded their networks to heavy rail standards, becoming today&#x27;s large private railways. To this day, private railway companies in Japan operate as highly influential business empires with diverse business interests, encompassing department stores, property developments and even tourist resorts. Many Japanese private railway companies compete with each other for passengers, operate department stores at their city termini, develop suburban properties adjacent to stations they own, and run special tourist attractions with admission included in package deals with rail tickets; similar to operations of large interurban companies in the US during their heyday.

While most interurbans in Japan have been upgraded beyond recognition to high-capacity urban railways, a handful have remained relatively untouched, with street running and using &#x27;lighter-rail&#x27; stock. To this day they retain a distinct character similar to classic American interurbans.

These include:
*The Keihan Keishin Line, operating between Kyoto and Otsu, with through services to the Tozai Line on the Kyoto side and street running on the Otsu side. Originally was entirely street running into Kyoto but was partly replaced by the opening of the Tozai Subway Line which trains through operate into.
*The Keihan Ishiyama Sakamoto Line a primary north south line operating in Otsu with some street running sections in the city center where it connects with the Keishin Line. 
*The Eizan Electric Railway originally an interurban that once through operated into the network but was isolated after the closure of the Kyoto City Tram. To this day operates light, one or two car consists. 
* The Enoshima Electric Railway, which is a line with elevated and on-street trackage, and operated with light, two-car articulated trains.
* The Fukui Railway Fukubu Line, which operates a variety of express and local services using light rail cars acquired from Nagoya Railroad&#x27;s defunct interurban network in Gifu, over a line with an extended on-street section.
* The Kumamoto Electric Railway, which operates ex-Tokyo subway stock on a line which includes a short on-street section.
* The Chikuhō Electric Railroad Line still operates articulated tramcars on private right-of-way, a holdover from its former inter-operation with the defunct Nishitetsu Kitakyushu street tram network.

=== Netherlands ===

The only surviving interurban line is also the oldest regional tramway in the Netherlands a line from The Hague to Delft. Which opened as horse-tramway in 1866. Nowadays the line operates as Line 1 of The Hague Tramway. Line E, run by Randstadrail, was an interurban line connecting Rotterdam to The Hague and in the past also to Scheveningen. It now interoperates with the Rotterdam Metro.

===Poland===
A large interurban network called the Silesian Interurbans still exists today connecting the urban areas of the Upper Silesia. It is one of the largest interurban networks in Europe.

In Łódź region, an interurban tram system connects Łódź, Pabianice, Zgierz and Konstantynów Łódzki, and formerly also Ozorków, Lutomiersk, Aleksandrów Łódzki, Rzgów and Tuszyn.

=== United States ===

Only three continuously operating passenger interurbans in the US remain with most being abandoned by the 1950s.

The South Shore Line is now owned by the state of Indiana and uses mainline-sized electric multiple units. Its last section of street running, in Michigan City, Indiana, was finally closed in 2022 for conversion to a grade-separated double-track line.

SEPTA operates two former Philadelphia Suburban lines: the Norristown High Speed Line (Route 100) as an interurban heavy rail line, and the Media–Sharon Hill Line (Routes 101 and 102) as a light rail line.

In Skokie, Illinois, the Skokie Valley portion of the North Shore Line from Dempster Street to Howard Street was acquired by the Chicago Transit Authority in 1963 and now runs as the Yellow Line. The Yellow Line initially operated with third rail from Howard Street to the Skokie Shops and switched to overhead wire for the remainder of the journey to Dempster Street, until 2004 when the overhead wire was replaced with third rail.

Several former interurban rights of way have been reused for modern light rail lines, including the A and E lines of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system and one section of the Baltimore Light RailLink system. Several museums and heritage railways, including the Western Railway Museum, Seashore Trolley Museum, Fox River Trolley Museum, and the Illinois Railway Museum operate restored equipment on former interurban lines. The Iowa Traction Railway still operates freight service today using interurban equipment and infrastructure. The River Line in New Jersey is also considered an interurban.

=== Switzerland ===
Switzerland operated a huge number of interurbans which today many have been upgraded into a number of different modes with a few remaining interurban features left. Several still have interurban characteristics such as unprotected alignments next to the road right of ways and/or street running. Today former interurban lines have been upgraded to operate as:

* Extensions of local tram system such as Bern Tramway Line 6 to Worb and Baselland Transport Line 10 formed from combining two narrow-gauge interurbans.
* Local private railway networks such as Aargau Verkehr, Aare Seeland mobil, Transports Publics du Chablais, Rhaetian Railway, Chemins de fer du Jura or as individual railways like the Lausanne–Bercher line and Waldenburg railway. These lines commonly retain some street running sections and unprotected roadside alignments.
* Tram-trains such as the Forch railway which is part of the Zürich S-Bahn operating on the Zürich Tram System in the city center or the St. Gallen–Trogen and Frauenfeld–Wil railways as part of the St. Gallen S-Bahn.

==Infrastructure and design==

=== Right of way ===
Interurbans typically ran along or on a public right-of-way. In towns, interurbans ran in the street, sharing track with existing street railroads. While street running limited acquisition costs, it also required sharp turns and made interurban operations susceptible to traffic congestion. Unlike conventional railroads, it was rare for an interurban to construct long unencumbered stretches of private right-of-way. The torque characteristics of electric operation allowed interurbans to operate on steeper grades than conventional steam locomotives.

===Trackage===

Compared to conventional steam railroad trackage, interurban rail was light and ballasted lightly, if at all. Most interurbans in North America were built to standard gauge (), but there were exceptions. In Europe narrow-gauge interurbans were more common. In Japan the national mainlines were built to narrow gauge however due to influence from for US interurban operations the first interurban companies in Japan built trackage to standard gauge. This remains the case today with Keikyu and Hanshin, forerunners of Japan&#x27;s interurbans, still using standard gauge today. Later companies regauged or outright built lines to narrow gauge for better interoperability and consistency with the Japanese mainline standards. Interurbans often used the tracks of existing street railways through city and town streets, and if these street railways were not built to standard, the interurbans had to use the non-standard gauges as well or face the expense of building their own separate trackage through urban areas. Some municipalities deliberately mandated non-standard gauges to prevent freight operations on public streets. In Pennsylvania, many interurbans were constructed using the wide &quot;Pennsylvania trolley gauge&quot; of . In Los Angeles, the Pacific Electric Railway, using standard gauge track, and the Los Angeles Railway, the city&#x27;s streetcar system, using narrow gauge, shared dual-gauge track in downtown Los Angeles with one rail common to each.

=== Electrification ===

Most interurban railways in North America were constructed using the same low-voltage 500 to 600 V DC trolley power in use by the street railways to which they connected. This enabled interurban cars to use the same overhead trolley power on town street car tracks with no electrical change on the cars to accommodate a different voltage. However, higher voltages became necessary to reduce power loss on long-distance transmission lines and routes, though substations were established to boost voltage. In 1905 Westinghouse introduced a 6600 V 25 Hz alternating current (AC) system which a number of railroads adopted. This required fewer substations than DC, but came with higher maintenance costs. The necessary on-board 6600 AC voltage reduction plus AC to DC rectification on each powered car to run DC traction motors added to greater car construction expense plus the operational dangers that such on-board high voltages created.

More common were high-voltage DC systems – usually 1200 V DC, introduced in 1908 by Indianapolis &amp; Louisville Traction Company for their &quot;Dixie Flyer&quot; and &quot;Hoosier Flyer&quot; services. In the streets, where high-speed service was not feasible, the cars ran at half speed at 600 V or got a voltage changeover device. such as on the Sacramento Northern. A 2400 V DC third-rail system was installed on the Michigan United Railways&#x27;s Western Division between Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids in 1915, but was abandoned because of the electrocution potential safety hazard. Even 5000 V DC was tested.

Most interurban cars and freight locomotives collected current from an overhead trolley wire. The cars contacted this wire through the use of a trolley pole or a pantograph. Other designs collected current from a third rail. Some interurbans used both: in open country, the third rail was used and in town, a trolley pole was raised. An example of this was the Chicago, Aurora, and Elgin Railroad where a trolley pole was used in both Aurora and Elgin, Illinois. Third rail was cheaper to maintain and more conductive, but it was more expensive to construct initially and it did not eliminate the need for AC transformers, AC transmission lines, and AC/DC conversion systems. In addition, third rail posed a serious danger to trespassers and animals and was difficult to keep clear of ice.

== Trains and equipment==

=== Rolling stock ===

From 1890 to 1910, roughly, American interurban cars were made of wood and often were very large, weighing up to and measuring as long as . These featured the classic arch-window look with truss-rods and cow-catchers. Three of the best known early companies were Jewett, Niles, and Kuhlman, all of Ohio. These interurbans required a two men crew, an operator and a conductor. By 1910, most new interurban cars were constructed of steel, weighing up to . As competition increased for passengers and costs needed to be reduced in the 1920s, interurban companies and manufacturers attempted to reduce car weight and wind resistance in order to reduce power consumption. The new designs also required only a one-man crew with the operator collecting tickets and making change. The trucks were improved to provide a better ride, acceleration, and top speed but with reduced power consumption. Into the 1930s, better quality and lighter steel and aluminum use reduced weight, and cars were redesigned to ride lower in order to reduce wind resistance. Car design peaked in the early 1930s with the light weight Cincinnati Car Company-built Red Devil cars of the Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad.

In addition to passenger cars, interurban companies acquired freight locomotives and line maintenance equipment. A &quot;box motor&quot; was a powered car exclusive for freight that looked like a passenger interurban without windows and had wide side doors for loading freight. A freight motor was geared for power rather than speed and could pull up to six freight cars depending upon the load and grades. Freight cars for interurbans tended to be smaller than those for steam railroads, and they had to have special extended couplers to prevent car corner contact at the very tight grinding turns at city street corners. Maintenance equipment included &quot;line cars&quot; with roof platforms for the trolley wire repair crew, snow plows and snow sweepers with rotating brushes, a car for weed control and to maintain track and ballast. In order to save money, many companies constructed these in their shops using retired or semi-wrecked passenger cars for the frame and the traction motor mounted trucks.

=== Passenger trains ===
Passenger interurban service grew out of horse-drawn rail cars operating on city streets. As these routes electrified and extended outside of towns interurbans began to compete with steam railroads for intercity traffic. Interurbans offered more frequent service than steam railroads, with headways of up to one hour or even half an hour. Interurbans also made more stops, usually apart. As interurban routes tended to be single-track this led to extensive use of passing sidings. Single interurban cars would operate with a motorman and conductor, although in later years one-man operation was common. In open country, the typical interurban proceeded at . In towns with the middle of the street operation, speeds were slow and dictated by local ordinance. The result was that the average speed of a scheduled trip was low, as much as under .

=== Freight trains ===
Many interurbans did substantial freight business. In 1926, the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway moved of freight per month. By 1929, this had risen to per month. During the 1920s freight revenue helped offset the loss of passenger business to automobiles. A typical interurban freight train consisted of a powered box motor pulling one to four freight cars. These often operated at night as local ordinances forbade daytime freight operation on city streets. Interurban freight in the Midwest was so extensive that Indianapolis constructed a very large freight handling warehouse which all of Indianapolis&#x27; seven interurbans companies used.

==In literature ==
In Raymond Chandler&#x27;s short story &quot;The Man who liked Dogs&quot;, the narrator trails a suspect in the Los Angeles area:
:Carolina Street was away off at the edge of the little beach city. The end of it ran into a disused inter-urban right of way, beyond which stretched a waste of Japanese truck farms. There were just two house in the last block ... the rails were rusted in a forest of weeds.

Similarly in &quot;Mandarin&#x27;s Jade&quot;:
:The Hotel Tremaine was far out of Santa Monica, near the junk yards. An inter-urban right of way split the street in half, and just as I got to the block that would have the number I had looked up, a two-car train came racketing by at forty-five miles an hour, making almost as much noise as a transport plane taking off. I speeded up beside it and passed the block.

In E.L. Doctorow&#x27;s &quot;Ragtime&quot;, a character rides on interurban systems from New York to Boston.

<text>Louisiana Purchase is a musical with music and lyrics by Irving Berlin and book by Morrie Ryskind based on a story by B. G. DeSylva. Set in New Orleans, the musical lightly satirises Louisiana Governor Huey Long and his control over Louisiana politics. An honest U.S. senator travels to Louisiana to investigate corruption in the Louisiana Purchase Company; the company&#x27;s lawyer attempts to divert him via the attentions of two beautiful women, but the senator maintains his integrity and ends up marrying one of them. In 1941 it was adapted for the film &quot;Louisiana Purchase&quot; directed by Irving Cummings.

The show opened at the Shubert Brothers&#x27; Imperial Theatre, New York City on May 28, 1940 and ran for 444 performances. It was produced by Buddy De Sylva, who also wrote the story, and staged by Edgar MacGregor. The musical orchestrations were by Robert Emmett Dolan and N. Lang Van Cleve, with the ballets by George Balanchine and the musical staging and dances by Carl Randall. On June 19, 1996, a concert version with the complete score was recorded at Carnegie Hall (during four performances), including three additional songs cut from the original album.

<doc id="393020" wikidata="Q3351858" url="?curid=393020" title="Eve teasing">
<text>In India, eve teasing is a euphemism, primarily occurring in Indian English, used for public sexual harassment or sexual assault of women by men. The name &quot;Eve&quot; alludes to the Bible&#x27;s creation story concerning Adam and Eve. Considered a problem related to delinquency in male youth, it is a form of sexual aggression that ranges in severity from sexually suggestive remarks, brushing in public places and catcalls, to groping.

The Indian National Commission for Women has suggested that the expression serves only to trivialize the seriousness of the offence and should be replaced by a more appropriate term. They argue that, considering the semantic roots of the term in Indian English, Eve teasing refers to the temptress nature of Eve, and places the responsibility on the woman as an alluring tease. 

As with most forms of personal harassment, sexual harassment is notoriously difficult to prove in a legal sense as perpetrators often devise intentionally discreet ways to harass women, although Eve teasing usually occurs in public spaces and streets and on public transport. Some guidebooks to the region warn female tourists to avoid attracting the attention of these kinds of men by wearing modest, conservative clothing. However, this form of harassment has been reported by both Indian and foreign women in conservative dress.

==History==
The problem first received public and media attention in India in the 1970s. In the following decades, more and more women started attending college and working independently, meaning that they were often no longer accompanied by a male escort as had been the norm in traditional society. In response, the problem grew to alarming proportions, despite this not being the case in other cultures where women come and go as they please. Soon the Indian government had to take remedial measures, both judicial and law enforcement, to curb the practice. Efforts were made to sensitise the police about the issue, and police started to round up Eve teasers. The deployment of plain-clothed female police officers for the purpose has been particularly effective. Other measures taken in various states by the police were setting up of dedicated women&#x27;s helplines in various cities, police stations staffed by women, and special police cells.

Also seen during this period was a marked rise in the number of women coming forward to report cases of sexual harassment, due to changing public opinion against this practice. In addition, the severity of these incidents grew as well, in some cases leading to acid throwing, which in turn led to states like Tamil Nadu making it a non-bailable offence. The number of women&#x27;s organisations and those working for women&#x27;s rights also increased, and during this period reports of bride burning increased. The increase in the number of violent incidents involving women meant previously lackadaisical attitudes towards women&#x27;s rights had to be revised and supported by law. In the coming years, certain organisations played a key role in lobbying for the passing of legislation designed to protect women from aggressive behaviour from strangers, including &#x27;The Delhi Prohibition of Eve-teasing Bill 1984&#x27;.

The death of a female student, Sarika Shah, in Chennai in 1998, resulted in some tough laws to counter the problem in South India. After murder charges were brought, about a half-dozen reports of suicide have been attributed to pressures caused by this behaviour. In February 2009, female students from Maharaja Sayajirao University (MSU) in Vadodara assaulted four young men near the family and community sciences faculty, after the men made lewd comments about a girl student staying in SD Hall hostel.

Many other cases go unreported for fear of reprisals and exposure to public shame. In some cases police let the offenders go, after public humiliation through the murga punishment. In 2008, a Delhi court ordered a 19-year-old caught making lewd remarks to passing females to distribute 500 handbills to youngsters outside schools and colleges detailing the consequences of indecent conduct.

==Depiction in popular culture==
Some depictions in Indian cinema shows mild teasing as a part of flirtatious beginnings of a courtship, along with the usual accompaniment of song and dance routines, which invariably results in the heroine submitting to the hero&#x27;s advances towards the end of the song. Young men tend to emulate the example depicted so flawlessly on screen; the term &quot;roadside Romeos&quot; even made it to film in &quot;Roadside Romeo&quot; (2007).

It also has been frequently depicted that when a girl is teased in this way, the hero will come and beat the perpetrator up in order to protect her and &#x27;defend her honour&#x27;, such as in the Telugu films &quot;Madhumasam&quot;, &quot;Magadheera&quot; and &quot;Eega&quot;, and also the Hindi film &quot;Wanted&quot;. Nowadays, this issue is also featured in Indian television soaps like &quot;Savdhaan India&quot; and &quot;Crime Patrol&quot;.

==Legal redress==

Although Indian law does not use the term &quot;Eve teasing&quot;, victims earlier usually seek recourse through Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code, which sentences a man found guilty of making a girl or woman the target of obscene gestures, remarks, songs or recitation to a maximum jail sentence of three months. Section 292 of the IPC clearly spells out that showing pornographic or obscene pictures, books or papers to a woman or girl results in a fine of with two years&#x27; imprisonment for first offenders. In the case of a repeated offense, the offender may have a fine of with five years&#x27; imprisonment imposed. Under Section 509 of the IPC, obscene gestures, indecent body language and negative comments directed at any woman or girl or exhibiting any object which intrudes upon the privacy of a woman, carries a penalty of imprisonment for one year or a fine or both. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 introduced changes to the Indian Penal Code, making sexual harassment an expressed offence under Section 354 A, which is punishable up to three years of imprisonment and or with fine. The Amendment also introduced new sections making acts like disrobing a woman without consent, stalking and sexual acts by person in authority an offense. It also made acid attacks a specific offence with a punishment of imprisonment not less than 10 years and which could extend to life imprisonment and with fine.

The National Commission for Women (NCW) also proposed No 9. Eve Teasing (New Legislation) 1988. The Indian Parliament has passed the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, which adds protections for female workers in most workplaces. The Act came into force from 9 December 2013.

==Public response==
&quot;Nirbhaya Karnataka&quot; (&quot;Fearless Karnataka&quot;) is a coalition of many individuals and groups including Alternative Law Forum, Blank Noise, Maraa, Samvada and Vimochana. After the rise of eve teasing cases in the 2000s, it organised several public awareness campaigns, including Take Back the Night, followed by another public art project titled, The Blank Noise Project, starting in Bangalore in 2003. A similar programme to fight eve-teasing was also hosted in Mumbai in 2008.

In Delhi, one of India&#x27;s most dangerous cities for women, the Department of Women and Child Development established a steering committee in 2009 to prepare the city for the Commonwealth Games to be held in 2010. In Mumbai, &quot;Ladies Special&quot; train compartments have been introduced to allow women to travel without the fear of being sexually harassed, for the length of the journey at least. Given that the number of women needing to travel has doubled since 1995, there is a very strong demand for these kinds of services. Today &quot;Ladies Special&quot; compartments are present in most local trains in big cities. The Delhi Metro also has exclusive women-only cars.

Starting in 2017, the Drukpa nuns of Amitabha, known as the &quot;Kung Fu Nuns&quot;, started teaching women&#x27;s self-defence training for the Ladakh/Himalayan towns, the first class being held at Hemis Monastery. While the sisters were performing rescue work after the 2015 Gorkha earthquake, they heard many stories of young women being sent away for better opportunities but ending up in sex slavery; these same small villages high in the Himalayas were also vulnerable to banditry. As part of their outreach, the nuns seek to strengthen women&#x27;s safety, position and value in their communities by teaching new skills, including self-defence and vocational training.

Eve teasing is highly criticised by the media and on social media websites such as Facebook.

<doc id="393023" wikidata="Q117484" url="?curid=393023" title="Dandruff">
<text>Dandruff is a skin condition of the scalp. Symptoms include flaking and sometimes mild itchiness. It can result in social or self-esteem problems. A more severe form of the condition, which includes inflammation of the skin, is known as seborrhoeic dermatitis.
The cause is unclear, but believed to involve a number of genetic and environmental factors; the condition may worsen in the winter. It is not due to poor hygiene, and the underlying mechanism involves the excessive growth of skin cells. Diagnosis is based on symptoms.
There is no known cure for dandruff. Antifungal cream, such as ketoconazole, or the keratolytic agent salicylic acid may be used to try to improve the condition. Dandruff affects about half of adults, with males more often affected than females. In addition, people in all areas of the world are affected. Onset is usually at puberty, and it becomes less common after the age of 50.

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptoms of dandruff are an itchy scalp and flakiness. Red and greasy patches of skin and a tingly feeling on the skin are also symptoms.

Dandruff and dry scalp are often confused since they share many of the same symptoms, but their causes and treatment are different. Dry scalp is simply dry skin on the scalp and can usually be easily treated with a skin care regimen.

== Causes ==

The cause is unclear but believed to involve a number of genetic and environmental factors.

As the skin layers continually replace themselves, cells are pushed outward where they die and flake off. For most individuals, these flakes of skin are too small to be visible. However, certain conditions cause cell turnover to be unusually rapid, especially in the scalp. It is hypothesized that for people with dandruff, skin cells may mature and be shed in two to seven days, as opposed to around a month in people without dandruff. The result is that dead skin cells are shed in large, oily clumps, which appear as white or grayish flakes on the scalp, skin and clothes.

According to one study, dandruff has been shown to be possibly the result of three factors:
# Skin oil, commonly referred to as sebum or sebaceous secretions
# The metabolic by-products of skin micro-organisms (most specifically &quot;Malassezia&quot; yeasts)
# Individual susceptibility and allergy sensitivity.

===Microorganisms===
Older literature cites the fungus &quot;Malassezia furfur&quot; (previously known as &quot;Pityrosporum ovale&quot;) as the cause of dandruff. While this species does occur naturally on the skin surface of people both with and without dandruff, in 2007, it was discovered that the responsible agent is a scalp specific fungus, &quot;Malassezia globosa&quot;, that metabolizes triglycerides present in sebum by the expression of lipase, resulting in a lipid byproduct: oleic acid. During dandruff, the levels of &quot;Malassezia&quot; increase by 1.5 to 2 times its normal level. Oleic acid penetrates the top layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, and evokes an inflammatory response in susceptible people which disturbs homeostasis and results in erratic cleavage of stratum corneum cells.

Bacteria are also suspected to be a cause. &quot;Staphylococcus capitis&quot; was found to be 100 times more abundant on scalps affected by dandruff.

For a long time, studies on dandruff predominantly focused on fungi, particularly the Malassezia species, which are major fungi colonizing the human scalp and the dominant members of the cutaneous fungal microbiome. Of the 14 known cultured species of Malassezia, the most clinically significant species are M. restricta and M. globosa. These species have been reported to be associated with skin diseases, including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, pityriasis dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis.

However, another microorganism community composed of bacteria also inhabits the human scalp and includes facultative anaerobic bacteria, such as P. acnes, and aerobic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus.

Using 454 pyrosequencing of the microbiome on scalp dandruff, eleven bacterial phyla were detected, but most sequences were assigned to two bacterial phyla: Actinobacteria (64.9%) and Firmicutes (32.5%). Of the 123 identified genera, Propionibacterium (63.3%, Actinobacteria) and Staphylococcus (32.4%, Firmicutes) comprised more than 95% of the total sequences. A total of 99.7% of the Propionibacterium belonged to P. acne, and 94.9% of the Staphylococcus were Staphylococcus spp (including S. epidermidis, S. capitis and S. caprae).

It was found that Propionibacterium decreased from 70.8% to 50.2% in the dandruff group, whereas Staphylococcus increased from 26.0% to 43.5%. Moreover, the proportion of the other low abundance bacteria increased in the dandruff group from 3.2% to 6.4%.

Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified 33 genera related to severity of dandruff including Staphylococcus showed a significant positive correlation with dandruff. In contrast, only two genera (Propionibacterium and Labrys) showed a significant negative correlation with dandruff. Because Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium were the two dominant but reciprocally inhibited bacterial genera on the scalp, these results indicated that dandruff was mainly associated with the balance of these two genera.

Microorganisms on the scalp, especially fungi, have been predominantly thought to be the main cause of the development of dandruff, after several studies it was observed that there was not a close association between the bacteria in genus and fungi in species. Furthermore, the relationship between bacteria and dandruff was stronger than the relationship between fungi and dandruff.

=== Seborrhoeic dermatitis ===
In seborrhoeic dermatitis, redness and itching frequently occur around the folds of the nose and eyebrow areas, not just the scalp. Dry, thick, well-defined lesions consisting of large, silvery scales may be traced to the less common condition of scalp psoriasis. Inflammation can be characterized by redness, heat, pain or swelling, and can cause sensitivity.

Inflammation and extension of scaling outside the scalp exclude the diagnosis of dandruff from seborrhoeic dermatitis. However, many reports suggest a clear link between the two clinical entities - the mildest form of the clinical presentation of seborrhoeic dermatitis as dandruff, where the inflammation is minimal and remains subclinical.

Seasonal changes, stress, and immunosuppression seem to affect seborrheic dermatitis.

== Mechanism ==
Dandruff scale is a cluster of corneocytes, which have retained a large degree of cohesion with one another and detach as such from the surface of the stratum corneum. A corneocyte is a protein complex that is made of tiny threads of keratin in an organised matrix. The size and abundance of scales are heterogeneous from one site to another and over time. Parakeratotic cells often make up part of dandruff. Their numbers are related to the severity of the clinical manifestations, which may also be influenced by seborrhea.

== Treatment ==

Shampoos use a combination of special ingredients to control dandruff.

=== Antifungals ===
Antifungal treatments including piroctone olamine, ketoconazole (Sebizole), zinc pyrithione, and selenium disulfide (Selsun Blue) have been found to be effective. Ketoconazole appears to have a longer duration of effect. Ketoconazole is a broad-spectrum antimycotic agent that is active against &quot;Candida&quot; and &quot;M. furfur&quot;. Of all the antifungals of the imidazole class, ketoconazole has become the leading contender among treatment options because of its effectiveness in treating seborrheic dermatitis as well.

Ciclopirox (topical route) may also be used as an anti-dandruff agent. However, it is mostly sold as cream and its main use is for treating athlete&#x27;s foot, jock itch, and ringworm.

Other than zinc pyrithione, the most common anti-dandruff actives (outside the US) and part of many cosmetic shampoos, are piroctone olamine and climbazole. Very recent anti-dandruff shampoos use a new ester technology, propanediol caprylate.

=== Exfoliating agents ===
Coal tar causes the skin to shed dead cells from the top layer and slows skin cell growth.

Salicylic acid is an approved anti-dandruff active as per the US FDA OTC drug monograph and also used in many cosmetic anti-dandruff shampoos globally.

==Etymology==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;dandruff&quot; is first attested in 1545, but is still of unknown etymology.

<text>Biological databases are libraries of biological sciences, collected from scientific experiments, published literature, high-throughput experiment technology, and computational analysis. They contain information from research areas including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microarray gene expression, and phylogenetics. Information contained in biological databases includes gene function, structure, localization (both cellular and chromosomal), clinical effects of mutations as well as similarities of biological sequences and structures.

Biological databases can be classified by the kind of data they collect (see below). Broadly, there are molecular databases (for sequences, molecules, etc.), functional databases (for physiology, enzyme activities, phenotypes, ecology etc), taxonomic databases (for species and other taxonomic ranks), images and other media, or specimens (for museum collections etc.)

Databases are important tools in assisting scientists to analyze and explain a host of biological phenomena from the structure of biomolecules and their interaction, to the whole metabolism of organisms and to understanding the evolution of species. This knowledge helps facilitate the fight against diseases, assists in the development of medications, predicting certain genetic diseases and in discovering basic relationships among species in the history of life.

== Technical basis and theoretical concepts ==
Relational database concepts of computer science and Information retrieval concepts of digital libraries are important for understanding biological databases. Biological database design, development, and long-term management is a core area of the discipline of bioinformatics. Data contents include gene sequences, textual descriptions, attributes and ontology classifications, citations, and tabular data. These are often described as semi-structured data, and can be represented as tables, key delimited records, and XML structures.

==Access==

Most biological databases are available through web sites that organise data such that users can browse through the data online. In addition the underlying data is usually available for download in a variety of formats. Biological data comes in many formats. These formats include text, sequence data, protein structure and links. Each of these can be found from certain sources, for example:
* Text formats are provided by PubMed and OMIM.
* Sequence data is provided by GenBank, in terms of DNA, and UniProt, in terms of protein.
* Protein structures are provided by PDB, SCOP, and CATH.

==Problems and challenges==

Biological knowledge is distributed among countless databases. This sometimes makes it difficult to ensure the consistency of information, e.g. when different names are used for the same species or different data formats. As a consequence, inter-operability is a constant challenge for information exchange. For instance, if a DNA sequence database stores the DNA sequence along the name of a species, a name change of that species may break the links to other databases which may use a different name. Integrative bioinformatics is one field attempting to tackle this problem by providing unified access. One solution is how biological databases cross-reference to other databases with accession numbers to link their related knowledge together (e.g. so that the accession number stays the same even if a species name changes). Redundancy is another problem, as many databases must store the same information, e.g. protein structure databases also contain the sequence of the proteins they cover, their sequence, and their bibliographic information.

== Model-organism databases ==

Species-specific databases are available for some species, mainly those that are often used in research (&quot;model organisms&quot;). For example, EcoCyc is an &quot;E. coli&quot; database. Other popular model organism databases include Mouse Genome Informatics for the laboratory mouse, &quot;Mus musculus&quot;, the Rat Genome Database for &quot;Rattus&quot;, ZFIN for &quot;Danio Rerio&quot; (zebrafish), PomBase for the fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;, FlyBase for &quot;Drosophila&quot;, WormBase for the nematodes &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; and &quot;Caenorhabditis briggsae&quot;, and Xenbase for &quot;Xenopus tropicalis&quot; and &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; frogs.

== Biodiversity and species databases ==
Numerous databases attempt to document the diversity of life on earth. A prominent example is the Catalogue of Life, first created in 2001 by Species 2000 and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System. The Catalogue of Life is a collaborative project that aims to document taxonomic categorization of all currently accepted species in the world. The Catalogue of Life provides a consolidated and consistent database for researchers and policymakers to reference. The Catalogue of Life curates up-to-date datasets from other sources such as Conifer Database, ICTV MSL (for viruses), and LepIndex (for butterflies and moths). In total, the Catalogue of Life draws from 165 databases as of May 2022. Operational costs of the Catalogue of Life are paid for by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the Illinois Natural History Survey, the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, and the Smithsonian Institution.

Some biological databases also document geographical distribution of different species. Shuang Dai et al. created a new multi-source database to document spatial/geographical distribution of 1,371 bird species in China, as existing databases had been severely lacking in spatial distribution data for many species. Sources for this new database included books, literature, GPS tracking, and online webpage data. The new database displayed taxonomy, distribution, species info, and data sources for each species. After completion of the bird spatial distribution database, it was discovered that 61% of known species in China were found to be distributed in regions beyond where they were previously known.

== Medical databases ==

Medical databases are a special case of biomedical data resource and can range from bibliographies, such as PubMed, to image databases for the development of AI based diagnostic software. For instance, one such image database was developed with the goal of aiding in the development of wound monitoring algorithms. Over 188 multi-modal image sets were curated from 79 patient visits, consisting of photographs, thermal images, and 3D mesh depth maps. Wound outlines were manually drawn and added to the photo datasets. The database was made publicly available in the form of a program called WoundsDB, downloadable from the Chronic Wound Database website.

== &quot;Nucleic Acids Research&quot; Database Issue ==
An important resource for finding biological databases is a special yearly issue of the journal &quot;Nucleic Acids Research&quot; (NAR). The Database Issue of NAR is freely available, and categorizes many of the public biological databases. A companion database to the issue called the Online Molecular Biology Database Collection lists 1,380 online databases. Other collections of databases exist such as MetaBase and the Bioinformatics Links Collection.

<text>Joël-François Durand (born 17 September 1954) is a French composer.

==Biography==
Born in Orléans, Durand studied mathematics, music education and piano in Paris, then composition with Brian Ferneyhough in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany (1981–84), and at Stony Brook University, New York, with Arel and Semegen (1984–86) . Between 1979 and 1984 he attended masterclasses by György Ligeti and Luciano Berio at the Centre Acanthes in Aix-en-Provence, and with Luigi Nono at the Freiburg Musikhochschule. In 1981–82 he was awarded a scholarship from the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) . In 1982 he received a Darmstadt Institute Scholarship for his String Trio, and in 1983 his piano piece &quot;...d&#x27;asiles déchirés...&quot; was awarded a prize at the Third International K.H. Stockhausen Composition Competition in Brescia, Italy. He left Europe in 1984 to pursue a PhD in Composition (awarded in 1988) at Stony Brook University (USA), where he studied composition with Bülent Arel and electronic music with Daria Semegen.

Durand was awarded scholarships from the Fulbright Foundation (1984) and from the French Ministry of Culture (1985). He received the &quot;Kranichsteiner Musikpreis&quot; from the Darmstadt Internationalen Ferienkurse in 1990. He was appointed assistant professor in composition at the University of Washington in 1991, and was invited to teach at the University of California, San Diego in the autumn of 1992 . During the 1980-90s, he was regularly invited as a lecturer at the summer courses at Darmstädter Ferienkurse. He taught at the annual mastercourse at the Fondation Royaumont in France in 1993. He is currently Professor of Composition , and since 2002 Associate Director of the University of Washington School of Music .

In parallel to his activity as composer, Durand designs and manufactures high-end tonearms for record players. He founded the company Durand Tonearms LLC in 2009.

<doc id="393027" wikidata="Q1047971" url="?curid=393027" title="Veery">
<text>The veery (Catharus fuscescens) is a small North American thrush species, a member of a group of closely related and similar species in the genus &quot;Catharus&quot;, also including the gray-cheeked thrush (&quot;C. minimus&quot;), Bicknell&#x27;s thrush (&quot;C. bicknelli&quot;), Swainson&#x27;s thrush (&quot;C. ustulatus&quot;), and hermit thrush (&quot;C. guttatus&quot;). Alternate names for this species include Wilson&#x27;s thrush (named so after Alexander Wilson) and tawny thrush. Up to six subspecies exist, which are grouped into the eastern veery (&quot;C.&quot; &quot;fuscescens fuscescens&quot;), the western veery or willow thrush (&quot;C. fuscescens salicicolus)&quot;, and the Newfoundland veery (&quot;C. fuscescens fuliginosus).&quot;

The specific name &quot;fuscescens&quot; is Neo-Latin for &quot;blackish&quot;, from Latin &quot;fuscus&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;. The English name may imitate the call.

==Description==

This species measures in length. Its mass is , exceptionally up to . The wingspan averages . Each wing measures , the bill measures and the tarsus is . The veery shows the characteristic under-wing stripe of &quot;Catharus&quot; thrushes. Adults are mainly light brown on the upperparts. The underparts are white; the breast is light tawny with faint brownish spots. Veeries have pink legs and a poorly defined eye ring. Birds in the eastern portions of the species&#x27; breeding range are more cinnamon on the upper parts; western birds are more olive-brown. In the east, the veery is distinguished easily by its coloration; distinguishing western veeries from other &quot;Catharus&quot; thrushes is more difficult.
This bird has a breezy, downward-spiraling, flute-like song, often given from a low and concealed perch. The most common call is a harsh, descending &quot;vee-er&quot;, which gave the bird its name. Other calls include a chuckle, a sharp and low &quot;wuck&quot;, and a slow &quot;wee-u&quot;. Veeries have been shown to decrease the rate and duration of singing when exposed to barred owl playback, possibly to decrease the chance of predation.

==Ecology and behavior==

=== Breeding and wintering habitat ===
The breeding habitat is humid deciduous forest across southern Canada and the northern United States. Breeding habitat includes dense growth and dense understory close to a water source, such as a stream. These birds migrate to eastern South America. It has been found that winter range may include the entire Amazon basin, Mérida state in Venezuela, the headwaters of the Orinoco River, and São Paulo state, Brazil. Stopover regions during migration of several veeries from Delaware include the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, the coasts of the Carolinas, Cuba, Jamaica, Colombia, and Venezuela. They are very rare vagrants to western Europe.

=== Feeding ===
They forage on the forest floor, flipping leaves to uncover insects; they may fly up to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects and berries. Insects are a main food source during the breeding season, while fruit and berries may compose most of the diet during the late summer and fall.

=== Nesting ===
They make a cup nest on the ground or near the base of a shrub. The nest consists of three structural layers, including outer, inner, and nest lining layers. The outer layer consists of leaves and supporting branches, while the inner layer consists of material woven together. Nest lining consists of flexible material such as bark, roots, and seeds. The use of different parts of 27 plant species, including invasive/alien plants, has been documented. Nests contain three to five greenish-blue eggs that may or may not have brown spots. The eggs are incubated for 10 to 14 days by the female, while both parents feed nestlings. Young Veeries can leave the nest between 10 and 12 days after they hatch.

This bird has been displaced in some parts of its range by the related wood thrush (&quot;Hylocichla mustelina&quot;). However, a case of interspecific parental care of a veery nest by a wood thrush has been documented in which a wood thrush provided more parental care to the veery nestlings than did the parents, possibly due to sexual solicitation by the female veery. Veeries are occasional hosts for the eggs of brown-headed cowbirds (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;). Veery males have been found to engage in behaviors similar to the polygynandrous Bicknell&#x27;s thrush in that males may feed nestlings at more than one nest and there may be multiple male feeders at nests.

== Threats ==
Threats to the veery include nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, climate change, and alteration of Amazonian lowland forests. It is suggested that veeries are in decline, and breeding bird survey trend results indicate that veery populations declined across most of its range from 1966 to 2013. There have been concerns that the use of invasive/alien plant parts may decrease nesting success, but negative impacts have not been documented. Other potential threats include the loss of woodland habitat, squirrels, chipmunks, and raptors.

<text>(spelled in modern ) was the name of the army commanded by the Basque Government during the Spanish Civil War. It was formed by Basque nationalists, socialists, communists, anarchists and republicans under the direction of &quot;lehendakari&quot; José Antonio Aguirre and coordinating with the army of the Second Spanish Republic. It fought the forces of Francisco Franco during 1936 and 1937.
It surrendered to the Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie at Santoña (province of Cantabria), while the rest of the Republican army kept fighting until 1939. This event is called the Santoña Agreement, Pact of Santoña, or Treason of Santoña by some Spanish leftists.

==Gudari==
The Basque word for a soldier, &quot;gudari&quot; (plural &quot;gudariak&quot;), is a neologism (from &quot;guda&quot;, &quot;war&quot;, thus meaning &quot;warrior&quot; literally). The Standard Basque word is the Romance-derived &quot;soldadu&quot;.
Like other Basque nationalist neologisms (&quot;ikurriña&quot;, &quot;lendakari&quot;), the meaning of &quot;gudari&quot; has been restricted to Basque concepts.
The Basque word for an army is the Romance-derived &quot;armada&quot;.

The members of the Basque militant ETA consider themselves &quot;gudariak&quot; continuing the struggle of the Civil War Basque soldiers.
This is contested by those war veterans that support the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party or Communist Party.

The &quot;Gudari Eguna&quot; (&quot;warrior day&quot;) is thus celebrated separately:

*by ETA supporters on 27 September, remembering the date (1975) of the execution of Jon Paredes (a.k.a. Txiki) in Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, and Ángel Otaegui in Burgos.
*by PNV supporters on 9 November since 1937.

<text>A mood swing is an extreme or sudden change of mood. Such changes can play a positive or a disruptive part in promoting problem solving and in producing flexible forward planning. When mood swings are severe, they may be categorized as part of a mental illness, such as bipolar disorder, where erratic and disruptive mood swings are a defining feature.

To determine mental health problems, people usually use charting with papers, interviews, or smartphone to track their mood/affect/emotion. Furthermore, mood swings do not just fluctuate between mania and depression, but in some conditions, involve anxiety.

== Terminology ==
Definitions of the terms mood swings, mood instability, affective lability, or emotional lability are commonly similar, which describe fluctuating or oscillating of mood and emotions. But each has unique characteristics that are used to describe specific phenomena or patterns of oscillation. Different from emotions or affect, mood is associated with emotional responses without knowing the reason (being unaware).

The dynamics of mood, mood patterns for long times are commonly erratic, labile or instable, also known as euthymic. Although the term of mood swing is unspecific, it may be used to describe a pattern where mood goes down from positive to negative valency immediately (without delay in baseline) at specific periods. And also generally have aperiodic patterns. This is because mood dynamics are influenced by various factors which can magnify or lessen fluctuations, such as when expectations become reality or not. Other terms for describing patterns are episodic, periodic, cyclothymia, rapid cycling, mixed states, short episodes, soft spectrum, diurnal variation, etc., although the definition of each term may be unclear.

==Overview==

===Speed and extent===
Mood swings can happen any time at any place, varying from the microscopic to the wild oscillations of bipolar disorder, so that a continuum can be traced from normal struggles around self-esteem, through cyclothymia, up to a depressive disease. However, most people&#x27;s mood swings remain in the mild to moderate range of emotional ups and downs. The duration of bipolar mood swings also varies. They may last a few hours – &quot;ultrarapid&quot; – or extend over days – &quot;ultradian&quot;: clinicians maintain that only when four continuous days of hypomania, or seven days of mania, occur, is a diagnosis of bipolar disorder justified. In such cases, mood swings can extend over several days, even weeks; these episodes may consist of rapid alternation between feelings of depression and euphoria.

== Characteristics ==

* Changing mood up and down without knowing the reason or external stimuli, in various degrees, duration and frequent, from high mood (happy, &quot;elevated&quot;, irritated) to low mood (sad, depressed).
* Sometimes it&#x27;s mixed, a combination between manic and depression symptoms or similar with bittersweet experiences that last for a day.
* Mood swings in normal people appear like &quot;climate changing&quot; at mild to moderate degree. Thus, unless it happens at a moderate degree or more, some people need more high emotional intelligence to recognize their mood change.
* Mood swings in mental illness simply can be described by generalized complexity based on &quot;mood dynamics&quot; (patterns that characterize the oscillation) like intensity (mild, moderate, severe), duration (days, weeks, years), average mood and other features, such as:

# Mood swings in cyclothymia: Mood swings occur episodically and aperiodic within 2 years or more at a moderate degree and frequently. Characterized by coexisting with anxiety, persistence, rapid shift, intense, impulsive, heightened by sensitivity and reactivity to external stimuli.
# Mood swings in bipolar II: Episodic, hypomanic (severe degree) episodes occur continuously for 4 days, depression episodes for weeks, and sometimes erratic episodes at moderate degree in between episodes.
# Mood swings in bipolar I: Episodic, manic episodes (severe degree) occur continuously for 7 days, depressive episodes for weeks, and sometimes erratic episodes at moderate degree in between episodes. Alterations in bipolar I and II can be &quot;rapid cyclic&quot;, which means changes of mood happen 4 times or more within a year. Symptoms of manic and hypomanic episodes are similar between bipolar I and bipolar II, just different in degree of intensity.
# Mood swings in Premenstrual symptoms (PMS): Episodically at mild to severe degree in the menses period, occur gradually or rapidly, start 7 days before and decrease at the onset of menses. Characterized by angry outbursts, depression, anxiety, confusion, irritability or social withdrawal.
# Mood swings in borderline personality disorder (BPD): Mood changes erratically with episodic mood swings. Mood swings fluctuate in rapid shifts for hours or days, not persistent, sensitive and heightened negative mood (e.g. irritability) by external stimuli. Mood appears in the form of high intensity of irritability, anxiety, and moderate degree depression (characterized by hostility, anger towards self, loneliness, isolation, related with relationships, emptiness or boredom).
# Mood swings in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) : Mood changes erratically and mood swings occur episodically, sometimes several times a day in rapid shifts. Characterized by a mild to moderate degree of irritability, related to the environment, impulsiveness (impatience to get rewards). In adult ADHD, high mood appears as excitement and low mood appears as boredom.
# Mood swings in schizophrenia: Although schizophrenia has flat emotions, a study in 2021 based on ALS-SF measures, Margrethe Collier et al., found that the score pattern of schizophrenia is similar to bipolar I. The alteration being related to delusions or hallucinations, mood changes that occur internally may be difficult to express externally (blunt affect), and heightened by external stimuli.
# Mood swings in major depressive disorder (MDD): Various mood patterns, and mood changes erratically. Mood swings occur episodically and fluctuate in moderate high mood and severe low mood. Characterized by having high negative affect (bad mood) most of the time, particularly in melancholic subtype. And also positive diurnal variation mood (bad mood in the morning, good mood in the evening), sensitivity to negative stimulation and mixed symptoms in some people, etc.
# Mood swings in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Mood changes erratically with episodic mood swings rising in the period of recovery process. Characterized by temporary fluctuations in negative affect (anxiety, irritability, shame, guilt) and self-esteem, reactive to environmental reminders, difficulty to control emotions, hyperarousal symptoms, etc.

==Causes==
There can be many different causes for mood swings. Some mood swings can be classified as normal/healthy reactions, such as grief processing, adverse effects of substances/drugs, or a result of sleep deprivation. Mood swings can also be a sign of psychiatric illnesses in the absence of external triggers or stressors.

Changes in a person&#x27;s energy level, sleep patterns, self-esteem, sexual function, concentration, drug or alcohol use can be signs of an oncoming mood disorder.

Other major causes of mood swings (besides bipolar disorder and major depression) include diseases/disorders which interfere with nervous system function. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, and autism spectrum are three such examples.

The hyperactivity sometimes accompanied by inattentiveness, impulsiveness, and forgetfulness are cardinal symptoms associated with ADHD. As a result, ADHD is known to bring about usually short-lived (though sometimes dramatic) mood swings. The communication difficulties associated with autism, and the associated changes in neurochemistry, are also known to cause autistic fits (autistic mood swings). The seizures associated with epilepsy involve changes in the brain&#x27;s electrical firing, and thus may also bring about striking and dramatic mood swings. If the mood swing is not associated with a mood disorder, treatments are harder to assign. Most commonly, however, mood swings are the result of dealing with stressful and/or unexpected situations in daily life.

Degenerative diseases of the human central nervous system such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington&#x27;s disease may also produce mood swings. Celiac disease can also affect the nervous system and mood swings can appear.

Not eating on time can contribute, or eating too much sugar, can cause fluctuations in blood sugar, which can cause mood swings.

===Brain chemistry===
If a person has an abnormal level of one or several of certain neurotransmitters (NTs) in their brain, it may result in having mood swings or a mood disorder. Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter that is involved with sleep, moods, and emotional states. A slight imbalance of this NT could result in depression. Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter that is involved with learning, memory, and physical arousal. Like serotonin, an imbalance of norepinephrine may also result in depression.

===List of conditions known to cause mood swings===
* Bipolar disorder or cyclothymia: Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder with characteristics of mood swings from hypomania or mania to depression. While cyclothymia is a lower degree of bipolar disorder. In 2022, ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group found that people with bipolar disorder have smaller subcortical volumes, lower cortical thickness and altered white matter integrity, which one of the functions is for emotion processing.
* Anabolic steroid abuse: Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone. Used for treatment of male hypogonadism or delayed puberty, stimulating muscle growth, as well as treating impotence, and AIDS. Studies found that overusing anabolic-androgenic steroids can cause mood swings, impulsive, and aggressive behavior. This behavior is associated with decreased emotion regulation systems such as the frontal cortex, temporal, parietal, and occipital. Studies also found that using anabolic-androgenic steroids can cause neuronal changes and death in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, thus symptoms of sleep and mood disorder occur.
* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): ADHD is known as a disorder with difficulty keeping control of attention, hyperactivity, frequently changing focus and losing interest and also hyperfocus when doing something interesting or pleasurable tasks. Mood dysregulation may be caused by distraction when absorbed in pleasurable tasks. Another contribution to mood swings is lower brain activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), increased size of the hippocampus and decreasing size of the amygdala in some people. Abnormalities in these parts of the brain can cause disturbance in attention, motivation, mood, and behavioral inhibition.
* Autism or other pervasive developmental disorder: Autism is a neurological and development disorder with symptoms such as lack of social skills, restricted repetitive behaviors, hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input, etc. Abnormal sensory processing is one of the reasons for mood swings in autism. Studies in 2015 found that in autism, the brain becomes overactivated in limbic areas, primary sensory cortices, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which functions for emotional and sensory processing. Studies found too, that the brain in autism has decreased connectivity between the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, increased amygdala reactivity, and reduced prefrontal response which contribute to emotion dysregulation.
* Borderline personality disorder: It has been theorized that borderline personality disorder comes from lack of ability to endure, learn and overcome negative events. People with BPD commonly have difficulty in relationships, which is associated with a tendency to anger-outbursts, judgment or expecting how others behave. Emotion dysregulation may be as a result of lack of interpersonal skills such as knowledge about emotions and how to control them, especially with intense emotions. Mostly, people with BPD use maladaptive emotion regulations like self-criticism, thought suppression, avoidance, and alcohol, which may trigger more mood disruption.
* Dementia, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Huntington&#x27;s disease: Dementia is known as a decreasing brain function disease that affects older people. In Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, mood dysregulation can be caused by decreasing function of emotional regulation, salience, cholinergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic function. Parkinson&#x27;s disease can generate mood swings and mood dysregulation such as depression, low self worth, shame and worry about the future caused by cognitive and physical problems. And in Huntington&#x27;s disease, common mood swings occur as a result of psychosocial, cognitive deficits, neuropsychiatric and biological factors.
* Dopamine dysregulation syndrome: Dopamine dysregulation syndrome is an effect of abusing Parkinson&#x27;s disease drugs to decrease motor and non-motor syndromes, which result in mania, violent behavior, and depression when withdrawal. Mood dysregulation from dopamine dysregulation syndrome occurs as a result of changes in the neurotransmitter systems such as disturbance in the dopaminergic reward system.
* Epilepsy: Epilepsy is an abnormal brain activity disease marked with seizures. Seizures occur because hypersynchronous and hyperexcitability of neurons, in other words, too much neural activity and excitability at the same time. Mood swings commonly appear before, during, after a seizure and during treatment. Studies found that seizures contribute to decreased function of emotions and mood processing as a consequence of abnormal neurogenesis and damaged neuron connections in the hippocampus and amygdala. Experiencing a seizure can cause mood swings caused by depression, anxiety, or worry about life being threatened. Another source of mood change comes from anticonvulsant drugs for epilepsy, like phenobarbital for increasing brain inhibitors or antiglutamatergic for decreasing brain activity which generates depression, cognitive dysfunction, sedation or mood lability.
* Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism: Hypo- and hyperthyroidism is an endocrine disease caused by low or excessive production of thyroid hormone. Abnormal thyroid hormone can affect mood, although the correlation between thyroid hormone and mood disorder is still not known.
* Intermittent explosive disorder: Intermittent explosive disorder is frequent rage that occurs spontaneous, uncontrolled, unproportioned and not persistent. This short duration of alternate mood occurs in the form of aggression verbally or physically towards people or property, sometimes followed by regret, shame and guilt after an act which might generate depression symptoms. Impulsive behavior in IED can be associated with hyperactivity in brain regions for regulating and emotional expression, such as the amygdala, insula, and orbitofrontal area.
* Menopause: Menopause in women commonly happens at age 52. One factor that causes mood disturbance is fluctuation of milieu hormones including sex steroids, growth hormones, stress hormones, etc.
* Major depression: Major depression is a disorder with symptoms such as feelings of sadness, loss of interest, emptiness and, for some people, mixed with irritability, &quot;mental overactivity,&quot; and &quot;behavioral overactivity&quot;. Development of irritability or anger may result from personality traits like narcissistic or coping strategies to avoid looking sad, worthless, or frustrated.
* Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: Obsessive compulsive disorder is marked with obsessions and compulsions about something that causes life distress and dysfunction. Alteration of mood and feeling discomfort such as shame, guilt or anxiety may occur caused by intrusive thoughts, fear, urge, and fantasy.
* Pathological demand avoidance
* Post traumatic stress disorder: Post-traumatic stress disorder is a disorder which is associated with frequently being disturbed by flashback memories and being haunted by feelings of fear and horror in the past. This contributes to the alteration of mood that occurs after a traumatic event happens, such as depression, outbursts of anger, self-destructive behaviors, and feelings of shame.
* Pregnancy: Women commonly experience mood swings during the pregnancy and the postpartum period. Hormone changes, stress and worry may be the reasons for changes of mood.
* Premenstrual syndrome: Women experience premenstrual syndrome like physical pains, mood swings, irritability or depression in a few days until 2 weeks of their period with different intensity. Furthermore, 4% to 14% of women experience severe PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which can decrease life quality. Despite the reason mood dysregulation in PMS is still unclear, Studies found that mood dysregulation is related with drop in progesterone concentrations, disruption of serotonergic transmission, GABAergic, stress, body-mass index, and traumatic events.
* Schizoaffective disorder: Mood swings in schizoaffective disorder are caused by mixed symptoms between schizophrenia and mood disorder.
* Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a disorder with symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, mood dysregulation, etc. Mood changes may be generated from hallucinations and delusions which cause anger, paranoia, and shame.
* Seasonal affective disorder: Seasonal affective disorder is depression which occurs during some seasons (commonly in winter), then manic or hypomanic episodes in the other season and that happens every year. These fluctuating moods appear in the form of anger attacks with depression and occur from season to season, also known as &quot;seasonal mood swings&quot;.
* XXYY syndrome: XXYY syndrome is a rare type of sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs). XXYY syndrome contributes to abnormal neurodevelopment and psychiatric diseases which can cause mood disorders.

==Treatment==
It&#x27;s part of human nature&#x27;s mood going up and down caused by various factors. Individual strength, coping skill or adaptation ability, social support or another recovery model might determine whether mood swings will create disruption in life or not.

Cognitive behavioral therapy recommends using &quot;emotional dampeners&quot; to break the self-reinforcing tendencies of either manic or depressive mood swings. Exercise, treats, seeking out small (and easily attainable) triumphs, and using vicarious distractions like reading or watching TV, are among the techniques found to be regularly used by people in breaking depressive swings. Learning to bring oneself &quot;down&quot; from grandiose states of mind, or &quot;up&quot; from exaggerated shame states, is part of taking a proactive approach to managing one&#x27;s own moods and varying sense of self-esteem.

Behavioral activation is a component of CBT that can break the cycle (depression leads to inactivity, inactivity leads to depression). This may rely on individual strengths to &quot;cold start&quot; the reward system.

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT): Another manifestation of mood swing is irritability, which can lead to elation, anger or aggression. DBT has a lot of coping skills that can be used for emotion dysregulation, such as mindfulness with the &quot;wise mind&quot; or emotion regulation with opposite action.

Emotion regulation therapy (ERT) has a package of mindful emotion regulation skills (e.g., attention regulation skills, metacognitive regulation skills, etc.) that can be handy to have when mood swings happen.

Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy can be used to regulate life rhythm when mood swings happen frequently and disrupt the rhythm of life. Episodes of mood disorder often liberate people from daily routines by making a mess of sleep schedules, social interaction, or work and causing irregular circadian rhythms.

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has a function to increase psychological flexibility by learning to assess present experience or be mindful, accept everything internally or externally, commit action to move toward personal recovery, etc.

<text>NRX (National Research Experimental) was a heavy-water-moderated, light-water-cooled, nuclear research reactor at the Canadian Chalk River Laboratories, which came into operation in 1947 at a design power rating of 10 MW (thermal), increasing to 42 MW by 1954. It was Canada&#x27;s most expensive science facility and the world&#x27;s most powerful nuclear research reactor at its construction.
NRX was remarkable for its heat output and the number of free neutrons it generated. In the late 1940s, NRX was the most intense neutron source in the world.

NRX experienced one of the world&#x27;s first major reactor accidents on 12 December 1952. The reactor began operation on 22 July 1947 under the National Research Council of Canada and was taken over by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) shortly before the 1952 accident. The accident was cleaned up, and the reactor was restarted within two years. NRX operated for 45 years, then shut down permanently on 30 March 1993. Decommissioning is underway at the Chalk River Laboratories site.

NRX was the successor to Canada&#x27;s first reactor, ZEEP. Because the operating life of a research reactor was not expected to be very long, in 1948, planning started for the construction of a successor facility, the National Research Universal reactor, which started self-sustained operation (or &quot;went critical&quot;) in 1957.

== Design ==
Two main processes govern a heavy water-moderated reactor. First, the water slows down (moderates) the neutrons which are produced by nuclear fission, increasing the chances of the high energy neutrons causing further fission reactions. Second, control rods absorb neutrons and adjust the power level or shut down the reactor in the course of regular operation. Inserting the control rods or removing the heavy water moderator can stop the reaction.

The NRX reactor incorporated a calandria, a sealed vertical aluminium cylindrical vessel with a diameter of and height of . The core vessel held about 175 vertical tubes in a hexagonal lattice, of heavy water and helium gas to displace air and prevent corrosion. The water level in the reactor could be adjusted to help set the power level. Fuel elements or experimental items were sitting in the vertical tubes and surrounded by air. This design was a forerunner of the CANDU reactors.

The fuel elements contained fuel rods long, in diameter and weighing , containing uranium fuel and sheathed in aluminium. Surrounding the fuel element was an aluminium coolant tube with up to of cooling water from the Ottawa River flowing through it. Between the coolant sheath and the calandria, an airflow of was maintained.

Twelve of the vertical tubes contained control rods made of boron carbide powder inside steel tubes. These could be raised and lowered to control the reaction, with any seven inserted being enough to absorb sufficient neutrons that no chain reaction could happen. The rods were held up by electromagnets so that a power failure would cause them to fall into the tubes and terminate the reaction. A pneumatic system could use air pressure from above to quickly force them into the reactor core or from below to slowly raise them from it. Four were called the &quot;safeguard bank&quot; while the other eight were controlled in an automatic sequence. Two pushbuttons on the main panel in the control room activated magnets to seal the rods to the pneumatic system, and the pushbutton to cause the pneumatic insertion of the rods into the core was located a few feet away.

== History ==

 NRX was for a time the world&#x27;s most powerful research reactor, vaulting Canada into the forefront of physics research. Emerging from a World War II cooperative effort between Britain, the United States, and Canada, NRX was a multipurpose research reactor used to develop new isotopes, test materials and fuels, and produce neutron radiation beams, that became an indispensable tool in the blossoming field of condensed matter physics.

The nuclear physics design of NRX emerged from the Montreal Laboratory of Canada&#x27;s National Research Council, which was established at the University of Montreal during WWII to engage a team of Canadian, British, and other European scientists in top-secret heavy-water reactor research. When the decision was made to build the NRX at what is now known as Chalk River Laboratories, the detailed engineering design was contracted to Canada&#x27;s Defence Industries Limited (DIL), who subcontracted construction to Fraser Brace Ltd.

In the early days of cancer radiation therapy, the NRX reactor was the world&#x27;s only source of the isotope cobalt-60, first used to bombard tumours in 1951.

In 1994, Dr. Bertram Brockhouse shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in the 1950s at NRX, which advanced the detection and analysis techniques used in the field of neutron scattering for condensed matter research.

Based on this design, the CIRUS reactor was built in India. It was ultimately used to produce plutonium for India&#x27;s Operation Smiling Buddha nuclear test.

It is claimed that the term &quot;crud&quot; originally stood for &quot;Chalk River Unidentified Deposit&quot;, used to describe the radioactive scaling that builds up on internal reactor components, first observed in the NRX facility. Crud has since become common parlance for &quot;Corrosion Related Unidentified Deposit&quot; and similar expressions and is commonly used with no relation to the Chalk River plant.

== Accident ==
On 12 December 1952, the NRX reactor suffered a partial meltdown due to operator error and mechanical problems in the shut-off systems. For test purposes, some fuel channels had been disconnected from high-pressure water cooling and were connected by hoses to a temporary cooling system; one low-power channel was cooled only by airflow.

During tests at low power, with low coolant flux through the core, the supervisor noticed several control rods being pulled from the core; an operator in the basement had incorrectly opened pneumatic valves. The wrongly-opened valves were immediately closed, but some control rods did not reenter the core and were stuck in almost withdrawn positions, but still low enough for their status lights to indicate them as lowered. Due to a miscommunication between the supervisor and the control room operator, the wrong buttons were pressed when the supervisor asked to lower the control rods into the core. Instead of sealing the withdrawn control rods to the pneumatic system, the safeguard bank of four control rods was accidentally withdrawn from the core. The operator noticed that the power level was exponentially increasing, doubling every 2 seconds, and tripped the reactor. However, three safeguard control rods were not inserted into the core, and the fourth took an abnormally long time, about 90 seconds, to insert while the power kept rising. After just 10 seconds, the core reached 17 MW(thermal). The cooling water boiled in some tubes connected to the temporary cooling system, and some of them ruptured; the positive void coefficient of the reactor led to a further power increase. About 14 seconds later, valves were manually opened to drain the heavy water moderator from the calandria. As this took some time to become effective, power increased for five more seconds, peaked at an estimated 100 MW, then went down as the moderator level decreased and was at zero 25 seconds later. The accident, from low to high to zero power, took about 108 seconds. Meanwhile, some fuel elements melted and were pierced in several places; the helium cover gas leaked, and the air was aspirated inside. Hydrogen and other gases evolved by radiation-induced cooling water dissociation; 3–4 minutes later, oxyhydrogen exploded in the calandria. During the incident, some gaseous fission products were vented to the atmosphere, and heavy water in the calandria was contaminated with the cooling water and the fission products.

To remove the fuel decay heat, the water cooling system was kept operating, leaking contaminated coolant to the reactor basement. About of radioactive materials, contained in about of water, collected in the basement of the reactor building during the next few days.

Clean-up of the reactor building required several months of work, assisted by 150 US Navy personnel after Admiral Rickover requested permission to send US nuclear submarine personnel to learn about cleaning up nuclear contamination. The US contingent included future US president Jimmy Carter, at the time a lieutenant in the US nuclear submarine program who was in charge of 12 men. The NRX reactor core and calandria, damaged beyond repair, were removed and buried, and an improved replacement was installed; the refurbished reactor started operating 14 months and 5 days after the accident. The clean up was primarily performed by 850 Atomic Energy of Canada staff, assisted by about 170 Canadian and 150 US military personnel, and 20 contractors.

The lessons learned in the 1952 accident advanced the field of reactor safety significantly, and the concepts it highlighted (diversity and independence of safety systems, guaranteed shutdown capability, efficiency of man-machine interface) became fundamentals of reactor design. The incident was the world&#x27;s first severe nuclear reactor accident.

<text>The hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus) is a medium-sized North American thrush. 

== Taxonomy ==
It is not very closely related to the other North American migrant species of &quot;Catharus&quot;, but rather to the Mexican russet nightingale-thrush. The specific name &quot;guttatus&quot; is Latin for &quot;spotted&quot;, though historically this species has been given 17 additional species or subspecies names by various authors, now all treated as synonyms.

==Description==
This species measures in length, spans across the wings and weighs . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . It is more compact and stockier than other North American &quot;Catharus&quot; thrushes, with relatively longer wings. The hermit thrush has the white-dark-white underwing pattern characteristic of &quot;Catharus&quot; thrushes. Adults are mainly brown on the upperparts, with reddish tails. The underparts are white with dark spots on the breast and grey or brownish flanks. They have pink legs and a white eye ring. Birds in the east are more olive-brown on the upperparts; western birds are more grey-brown.

==Distribution and habitat.==
Hermit thrushes breed in coniferous or mixed woods across Canada, southern Alaska, and the northeastern and western United States. They are very rare vagrants to western Europe and northeast Asia.

While most hermit thrushes migrate to wintering grounds in the southern United States and south to Central America, some remain in northern coastal US states and southern Ontario. Identification of spotted thrushes is simplified by the fact that hermit thrush is the only spotted thrush normally found in North America during winter. 

== Breeding ==
Hermit thrushes make a cup nest on the ground or relatively low in a tree. They usually breed in forests, but will sometimes winter in parks and wooded suburban neighborhoods.

== Behavior ==
Hermit thrushes forage on the forest floor, as well as in trees or shrubs, mainly eating insects and berries.

==Song==
The hermit thrush&#x27;s song has been described as &quot;the finest sound in nature&quot; and is ethereal and flute-like, consisting of a beginning note, then several descending musical phrases in a minor key, repeated at different pitches. It often sings from a high open location. Analysis of the notes of its song indicates that they are related by harmonic simple integer pitch ratios, like many kinds of human music and unlike the songs of other birds that have been similarly examined.

==In culture==

The hermit thrush is the state bird of Vermont.

Walt Whitman construes the hermit thrush as a symbol of the American voice, poetic and otherwise, in his elegy for Abraham Lincoln, &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d,&quot; one of the fundamental texts in the American literary canon. &quot;A Hermit Thrush&quot; is the name of a poem by the American poet Amy Clampitt. A hermit thrush appears in the fifth section (&quot;What the Thunder Said&quot;) of the T. S. Eliot poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.

Former Canadian indie-rock band Thrush Hermit took their name from a reversal of the bird&#x27;s name. It is also shared by the American bands Hermit Thrushes and Hermit Thrush.

<text>In mathematics, a rigged Hilbert space (Gelfand triple, nested Hilbert space, equipped Hilbert space) is a construction designed to link the distribution and square-integrable aspects of functional analysis. Such spaces were introduced to study spectral theory. They bring together the &#x27;bound state&#x27; (eigenvector) and &#x27;continuous spectrum&#x27;, in one place.

Using this notion, a version of the spectral theorem for unbounded operators on Hilbert space can be formulated. &quot;Rigged Hilbert spaces are well known as the structure which provides a proper mathematical meaning to the Dirac formulation of quantum mechanics.&quot;

==Motivation==

A function such as
formula_1
is an eigenfunction of the differential operator
formula_2
on the real line , but isn&#x27;t square-integrable for the usual (Lebesgue) measure on . To properly consider this function as an eigenfunction requires some way of stepping outside the strict confines of the Hilbert space theory. This was supplied by the apparatus of distributions, and a &quot;generalized eigenfunction&quot; theory was developed in the years after 1950.

==Definition==

A rigged Hilbert space is a pair with a Hilbert space, a dense subspace, such that is given a topological vector space structure for which the inclusion map
formula_3
is continuous. Identifying with its dual space , the adjoint to is the map
formula_4

The duality pairing between and is then compatible with the inner product on , in the sense that:
formula_5
whenever formula_6 and formula_7. In the case of complex Hilbert spaces, we use a Hermitian inner product; it will be complex linear in (math convention) or (physics convention), and conjugate-linear (complex anti-linear) in the other variable.

The triple formula_8 is often named the &quot;Gelfand triple&quot; (after Israel Gelfand). formula_9 is referred to as a pivot space.

Note that even though is isomorphic to (via Riesz representation) if it happens that is a Hilbert space in its own right, this isomorphism is &quot;not&quot; the same as the composition of the inclusion with its adjoint 
formula_10

===Functional analysis approach===

The concept of rigged Hilbert space places this idea in an abstract functional-analytic framework. Formally, a rigged Hilbert space consists of a Hilbert space , together with a subspace which carries a finer topology, that is one for which the natural inclusion
formula_11
is continuous. It is no loss to assume that is dense in for the Hilbert norm. We consider the inclusion of dual spaces in . The latter, dual to in its &#x27;test function&#x27; topology, is realised as a space of distributions or generalised functions of some sort, and the linear functionals on the subspace of type
formula_12
for in are faithfully represented as distributions (because we assume dense).

Now by applying the Riesz representation theorem we can identify with . Therefore, the definition of &quot;rigged Hilbert space&quot; is in terms of a sandwich:
formula_13

The most significant examples are those for which is a nuclear space; this comment is an abstract expression of the idea that consists of test functions and of the corresponding distributions. 

An example of a nuclear countably Hilbert space formula_14 and its dual formula_15 is the Schwartz space formula_16 and the space of tempered distributions formula_17, respectively, rigging the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions. As such, the rigged Hilbert space is given by
formula_18
Another example is given by Sobolev spaces: Here (in the simplest case of Sobolev spaces on formula_19)
formula_20
where formula_21.

<text>Playa del Rey (Spanish for &quot;Beach of the King&quot;) is a seaside neighborhood on the westside of Los Angeles in the Santa Monica Bay region of Los Angeles County, California. It has a ZIP Code of 90293 and area codes of 310 and 424. As of 2018, the community had a population of 16,230 people.

==History==

Lower Playa del Rey was originally wetlands and sand dune soil, but natural flooding was halted by levees made of earthen soil, boulders and reinforced concrete with a soft-bottom submerged soil that promotes both tidal flow in good weather and facilitated the flow of freshwater into the ocean in rainy weather, resulting in a dynamic estuarine river known as Ballona Creek.

The wetlands area were inhabited by the Tongva came to the wetlands three to five thousand years ago. The area was important for fishing and shellfish harvesting. The usage of wooden plank boats known as &quot;te&#x27;aats&quot; were used to paddle out to the Channel Islands. Guashna was the major village in the area and was an important regional trade center.

In the 1870s, Playa Del Rey was the location of the first attempt at a dredged harbor in Santa Monica Bay. Under contract with the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad, Moye Wicks&#x27; syndicate spent $300,000 to dredge Port Ballona Harbor, for shipping to the Orient. Within three years, winter waves brought flooding, but what remained of man&#x27;s early efforts became the Del Rey Lagoon, now a municipal public park.

In 1902, buyers interested in land at the new Playa Del Rey development were instructed to travel by streetcar to Alla Station where “tally-hos” awaited them. The new development eventually got its own streetcar stop on the Redondo Beach via Playa del Rey Line beginning from the Ivy Station. In 1910, the Playa del Rey Motordome was built, the first board track in the world; it was used for bike and also early auto racing.

Palisades del Rey was the name of the original 1921 neighborhood land development by Dickinson &amp; Gillespie Co. that later came to be called Playa del Rey. The company advertised this area of sand dunes as the last stretch of coastal land in the city of Los Angeles to be developed. All of the houses in this area were custom built, many as beach homes owned by Hollywood actors and producers, including Cecil B. Demille, Charles Bickford, and others.

Construction in Playa del Rey surged in 1928 with the development of the Del Rey Hills neighborhood in the Eastern part of the community (to the East of Pershing Drive), and the move of Loyola University (now Loyola Marymount University) to the adjacent community of Westchester.

The southern portion of the original Playa del Rey development, which came to be known as Surfridge, is now vacant. Between 1966 and 1975, the houses that were once there were either moved or demolished to facilitate the expansion of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and to address concerns about the noise of increasing jet plane traffic. The noise from the flights made it less desirable to live on the dunes above the ocean under the LAX flight path. The City of Los Angeles condemned the southern section of Playa del Rey under the power of eminent domain and purchased all of the homes. Today, one can see only barbed-wire fences protecting vacant land and old streets where houses once sat. Recent LAX rejuvenation plans call for the city to finally remove the old streets that still line the empty neighborhood. The condemned areas of the community are now a protected habitat of the endangered El Segundo blue butterfly.

Playa del Rey in the 1950s and early 1960s was known as a great Los Angeles area surf spot, but due to the many rock jetties that were built to prevent beach erosion, the good surf has mostly disappeared. The construction of Marina Del Rey, which involved the hardening of the Ballona Creek mouth and the addition of a massive breakwater shielding the harbor from ocean storms, dramatically altered wave patterns in the area. Compared to other nearby beaches, the areas immediately North and South of the Marina Breakwater are steeply sloped and waves tend to crash in very shallow water very close to shore. The beach at the northernmost end of Playa del Rey is still known as Toes Over Beach, Toes Beach, or just &quot;Toes&quot; by the local surfing community, a name derived from the toes-over or hang ten surfing maneuver. Most surfers now flock south of Dockweiler Beach to El Porto (the northernmost part of beach in the city of Manhattan Beach) or north of Marina del Rey to Venice Beach. The lifeguard and park services are uniform across the entire stretch of beach.

One danger for beachgoers is the uncontrolled water runoff from the creek, and the occasional emergency overflow from the giant Hyperion treatment plant to the south. Under normal conditions, the plant discharges treated water out to sea, but a rarely used outflow pipe exists for emergencies or during maintenance. Wastewater discharged from this shorter pipe is close enough to shore to severely impact beach conditions when it is in use.

Locals refer to the small area of housing closest to the beach, where Culver Boulevard joins Vista del Mar, as &quot;The Jungle,&quot; a nickname given to a group of closely built 1956 apartments bounded by Trolley Place and Trolleyway Street on its east and west respectively, and including the streets Fowling, Rees, Sunridge and Surf. The small sidewalks between homes had/have deep green overgrowth, which added to the name.

Today, the Pacific Avenue Bridge between Playa Del Rey and the jetty between Ballona Creek and the Marina is accessible to foot traffic and bicycle traffic, but not to automobiles. Bikers, skaters and joggers can cross this bridge to continue north to Santa Monica, and to the South Bay. It is the only pedestrian crossing over Ballona Creek between the ocean and Centinela Avenue, and the Lincoln Boulevard and Marina Freeway bridges both lack sidewalks.

Both the University of California, Los Angeles and Loyola Marymount University have crew teams that practice on the Ballona Creek channel and in Marina del Rey.

==Geography==
Considered part of Silicon Beach, Playa del Rey is a coastal neighborhood and a district of the city of Los Angeles. Its location immediately north of Los Angeles International Airport exposes some residents to air and noise pollution generated at the airport. Over the years, expansions at the airport have forced more than a thousand residents to move and hundreds of houses to be demolished.

The community is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west, Marina del Rey and Ballona Creek to the north, the Ballona Wetlands and Playa Vista to the northeast, Westchester to the east, and Los Angeles International Airport and El Segundo to the south.

The city of Los Angeles has three small parks in Playa del Rey: Del Rey Lagoon Park, the Titmouse Park, and Vista Del Mar Park. Del Rey Lagoon Park, which has an area of about , also has a shallow saltwater swamp-pond known as Del Rey Lagoon. The pond has an area of about , with a maximum depth of about . The lagoon’s depth varies over time of day, as it is partially connected with the Ballona Creek by an underground pipe. The park is bounded by Ballona Creek to the north, Convoy Street to the south, Pacific Avenue to the west, and Esplanade and an apartment complex to the east.

Playa del Rey&#x27;s rolling hills and depression wetland ponds are the result of ancient, wind-blown, compacted sand dunes that rise up to above sea level, originally called and often referred to as The Del Rey Hills or &quot;The Bluffs.&quot; These dunes run parallel to the coastline, from Playa del Rey, all the way south to Palos Verdes.

==Demographics==


According to data from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Mapping L.A.&quot; project, the area&#x27;s demography was 72.6% Non-Hispanic White, 7.7% Asian, 3.9% Black, 10.0% Latino and 5.8% of other backgrounds.

Of employed Playa Del Rey residents, 94.7% work in a white-collar profession. 65.6% of all residents 25 years of age or older have at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and 39.8% of residents have obtained a graduate-level education or more. As of 2021, the median price for a single family home in the 90293 zip code has exceeded $3 million, and the average income is $148,296, which is among the wealthiest in Los Angeles.

==Economy==
As Playa del Rey is located in the heart of the Silicon Beach, the economy has become largely driven by the tech sector. The neighborhood is also home to a large number of airline and aerospace employees, owing to its proximity to LAX. The vast majority of land in Playa del Rey is zoned for residential purposes only. It is known for its large ocean-view estates, but the bulk of the population lives in the eastern portion, which is densely developed with apartment and condominium complexes. Only portions of Manchester Avenue, Pershing Drive and Culver Boulevard have businesses—mainly restaurants and a pharmacy—and offices mixed in with residential buildings.

==Government and infrastructure==
Los Angeles Fire Department Station 5 (Westchester/LAX Area) is in the area.

Los Angeles Police Department operates the Pacific Community Police Station at 12312 Culver Boulevard, 90066, serving the neighborhood.

The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services SPA 5 West Area Health Office serves Playa del Rey.

Playa del Rey lies entirely within the 11th council district of Los Angeles, and is represented on the city council by Traci Park.

==Education==
Playa del Rey is within the Los Angeles Unified School District. The area is within Board District 4. As of 2009, Steve Zimmer represents the district.

Notable schools in the area include Westchester Enriched Sciences Magnets (6–8) and St. Bernard High School, a private Roman Catholic school.

As of 2014, the Wiseburn School District allows parents in Playa del Rey to send their children to Wiseburn schools on inter-district transfers.

<text>In mathematics, an index set is a set whose members label (or index) members of another set. For instance, if the elements of a set may be &quot;indexed&quot; or &quot;labeled&quot; by means of the elements of a set , then is an index set. The indexing consists of a surjective function from onto , and the indexed collection is typically called an &quot;indexed family&quot;, often written as .

==Examples==
*An enumeration of a set gives an index set formula_1, where is the particular enumeration of .
*Any countably infinite set can be (injectively) indexed by the set of natural numbers formula_2.
*For formula_3, the indicator function on is the function formula_4 given by formula_5

The set of all such indicator functions, formula_6, is an uncountable set indexed by formula_7.

==Other uses==
In computational complexity theory and cryptography, an index set is a set for which there exists an algorithm that can sample the set efficiently; e.g., on input , can efficiently select a poly(n)-bit long element from the set.

<doc id="393057" wikidata="Q1636919" url="?curid=393057" title="Macintosh Portable">
<text>The Macintosh Portable is a portable computer that was designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from September 1989 to October 1991. It is the first battery-powered Macintosh, which garnered significant excitement from critics, but sales to customers were quite low. It featured a fast, sharp, and expensive monochrome active-matrix LCD screen in a hinged design that covered the keyboard when the machine was not in use. The Portable was one of the early consumer laptops to employ an active-matrix panel—only the most expensive of the initial PowerBook line, the PowerBook 170, had such a panel. The machine was designed to deliver high performance, at the cost of increased price and weight. The Portable was discontinued in October 1991.

The Macintosh Portable can run Macintosh System 6.0.4 through System 7.5.5.

==Background==
By the late 1980s, Macintosh users yearned for a portable version of their computer. Don Crabb titled his February 1989 column in &quot;BYTE&quot; &quot;Hey Apple, I Need a Laptop&quot;. While third-party Macintosh conversions such as Dynamac and Colby existed, they were very expensive, and some are as heavy as or heavier than Apple&#x27;s compact Macs; Crabb&#x27;s column&#x27;s subtitle was &quot;The time has come for a portable mac that doesn&#x27;t strain your arms or your credit line&quot;.

== Hardware ==
The Macintosh Portable&#x27;s pointer is a built-in trackball that can be removed and located on either side of the keyboard, and can also be replaced with a numeric keypad if a mouse is being used. There were three drive configurations available for Macintosh Portable. A Portable could ship with one floppy drive, with two floppy drives, or with a hard drive and a floppy drive. The floppy drive is 1.44 MB. Most Macintosh Portable units came with a hard drive, a custom-engineered Conner CP-3045 (known by Apple as &quot;Hard Disk 40SC&quot;). It holds 40 MB of data, consumes less power compared to most hard drives of its time, and has a proprietary 34-pin SCSI connector; third-party adapters that allow standard SCSI drives to be used on the Portable exist. At 16 pounds (7.2 kilograms) and 4 inches (10 centimetres) thick, the Portable is a heavy and bulky portable computer. The main contributor to the Portable&#x27;s weight and bulk was its lead–acid battery.

== Display issues ==

Despite the dramatic improvement in terms of ergonomics offered by the responsiveness, sharpness, and uniformity of its active-matrix panel, one of the primary drawbacks of the Portable was poor readability in low-light situations. Consequently, in February 1991, Apple introduced a backlit Macintosh Portable (model M5126) with a lowered price. The backlight feature was a welcomed improvement, but the backlight, and combined with a switch from an expensive SRAM (intended to maximize battery life and to provide an &quot;instant on&quot; low-power sleep mode) to a cheaper, more power-hungry pseudo-SRAM (which also reduced the total RAM expansion to 8 MB) reduced the battery life by about half. An upgrade kit was also offered for the earlier model as well, which plugged into the ROM expansion slot.

== Battery issues ==
The lead–acid battery pack on the non-backlit Portable offered up to ten hours of usage time, and the Portable draws the same amount of power when turned off, and when in sleep mode. The Portable, unlike many later portable computers from Apple and other manufacturers, will not boot without the battery pack installed. This is due to the relatively low power output of the included AC charger, 1.5 A at 7.5 V, which is insufficient to spin up the hard disk, which has an initial startup current draw requirement of 2–3 amps. The battery pack must be installed and have sufficient charge to provide the additional current required during hard disk startup. Once booted and running, the total power required to run the computer drops below 1.5A and the Portable can continue to run on the AC charger alone. Several popular unauthorized workarounds were devised to allow the Portable to boot without a battery pack installed, including using an AC power supply from the PowerBook 100 series, which provides higher output.

The battery packs are no longer manufactured and it is very rare to find one that will hold a charge and allow the computer to start. As with other lead–acid batteries, such as automotive batteries, the sealed lead–acid (SLA) cells used in the Portable&#x27;s battery pack sulfated and eventually failed if they were left for an extended time in a fully discharged state, such as when the computer was stored for more than a few months. It is possible to repack the battery with new cells, or use alternative 6 V batteries. There were three &quot;X&quot; size cylindrical sealed lead–acid cells inside the battery pack, manufactured by Gates Energy Products (now EnerSys); the same cells were also used in Quantum 1 battery packs for photographic flash use. The battery pack can be rebuilt with new EnerSys &quot;Cyclon&quot; brand batteries, using either three part number 0800-0004 single cells of 2V each, or using one 6V monobloc part number 0809-0012.

== Development ==
There is some indication that Apple executives at the time, particularly Jean-Louis Gassée, were aware of the design problems concerning the Macintosh Portable. These problems, combined with supply issues of the newly developed active-matrix screen, caused numerous delays in launching the computer. While it cannot be determined what the initial internal intended launch date was, an AppleDesign illustration depicts prototypes dated 1986. Initial officially announced launch dates indicated that the Macintosh Portable would be available by June 1988. The Macintosh Portable itself also suggests a lengthy development time with a silkscreen date stamp of 1987 on the production keyboard PCB, indicating a close-to-final design was likely to have been determined by then. The computer, however, would not be launched for over two years, with the final launch date being September 20, 1989.

== Reception ==
The Macintosh Portable product launch was held at the Universal Amphitheater in Universal City, California at an estimated cost of $1 million with over 5,000 guests. The press reaction was mixed, with many praising the clear LCD screen, but most shunning the computer due to its size, weight and high cost, with the Los Angeles Times stating &quot;It’s too big, too heavy and too expensive.&quot; Others noted that the computer seemed behind the times compared to competing laptops, stating that &quot;This machine would have been OK 12 months or 18 months ago. But not today.&quot;

Apple had forecast first year sales of 50,000 units. However, the computer only generated lackluster sales of 10,000 units in its first quarter on the market. Apple then reduced the price of the Macintosh Portable by $1,000 in 1990, just 7 months after launch. The company discontinued the computer in 1991 with the launch of its replacement, the PowerBook series.

<text>Winnetka () is a neighborhood in the west-central San Fernando Valley in the city of Los Angeles. It is an ethnically diverse area, both for the city and for Los Angeles County, with a relatively large percentage of Hispanic and Asian people.

Winnetka was founded in 1922 as a small farming community. As of 2018, there are six public and four private schools in the area, a recreation center, two pocket parks and a city-operated child-care center.

==Population==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 40,943 residents in the 4.78-square-mile Winnetka neighborhood, or 9,286 people per square mile, about an average population density for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 54,825. In 2000 the median age for residents was 32, considered average for city and county neighborhoods. The ethnic composition of the area was Latinos, 40.6%; whites, 36.1%; Asians, 15.5%; blacks, 4.3%; and others, 3.5%. Mexico (34.5%) and the Philippines (10.9%) were the most common places of birth for the 41.4% of the residents who were born abroad—an average percentage for Los Angeles.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $62,435, considered average for the city and county. The percentage of households earning $40,000 to $60,000 in 2000 was high for the county. Renters occupied 48.3% of the housing stock and house- or apartment-owners held 51.7%.

The 2010 census counted a population of 49,043 per 4.1 square miles or 11,851 people per square mile.

The median age of residents is 37.1 years of age. A little higher than the average in California, which is 36 years of age. The highest age group of the population fall between the ages of 20-29 at 16% and the lowest falling at the age of 80+ at 3%. The sex of the population slightly favors men, with men taking up 51% of the population and women taking up 49% of the population. The racially diverse community is dominated by Hispanics taking up 53% of the population, followed by whites with 24%, Asians with 17%, Blacks with 3%, and others taking up the last 3%. Out of the population only 44% are foreign born, 59% from Latin America, 35% from Asia, 5% from Europe, and about 2% from Africa.

The median yearly household income in 2010 is $62,748, which is about the same as the average California amount. About 40% of the population fell under the $50,000 mark and 14.7% of the population fall under the poverty line. Renters make of 42% of the house or apartment stock while owners make up 58%.

==Geography==

The Los Angeles neighborhoods surrounding Winnetka include Chatsworth to the north, Northridge on the northeast, Reseda to the east, Woodland Hills to the south, and Canoga Park to the west.

==Education==

A total of 21.9% of Winnetka residents aged 25 and older have earned a four-year degree, which is considered an average figure for both the city and the county. Schools located in the neighborhood are:

As of the 2010 census 76.5% of the population is a high school graduate or higher and 23.7% have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, both fall below the state average. Population of this statistic are 25 years and over.

==History==
In 1920, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce requested that Charles Weeks come to the San Fernando Valley to establish a series of one-acre egg farms. The farms would be based on the successful formula Weeks developed in East Palo Alto, California. The &quot;poultry colony&quot; Weeks created in the Winnetka area of the valley eventually developed into a small farming community named Weeks Poultry Colony.

<doc id="393061" wikidata="Q154507" url="?curid=393061" title="Speleothem">
<text>A speleothem (; ) is a geological formation made by mineral deposits that accumulate over time in natural caves. Speleothems most commonly form in calcareous caves due to carbonate dissolution reactions. They can take a variety of forms, depending on their depositional history and environment. Their chemical composition, gradual growth, and preservation in caves make them useful paleoclimatic proxies.

==Chemical and physical characteristics==
More than 300 variations of cave mineral deposits have been identified. The vast majority of speleothems are calcareous, composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minerals (calcite or aragonite). Less commonly, speleothems are made of calcium sulfate (gypsum or mirabilite) or opal. Speleothems of pure calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate are translucent and colorless. The presence of iron oxide or copper provides a reddish brown color. The presence of manganese oxide can create darker colors such as black or dark brown. Speleothems can also be brown due to the presence of mud and silt.

Many factors impact the shape and color of speleothems, including the chemical composition of the rock and water, water seepage rate, water flow direction, cave temperature, cave humidity, air currents, aboveground climate, and aboveground plant cover. Weaker flows and short travel distances form narrower stalagmites, while heavier flow and a greater fall distance tend to form broader ones.

==Formation processes==
Most cave chemistry involves calcium carbonate (CaCO3) containing rocks such as limestone or dolomite, composed of calcite or aragonite minerals. Carbonate minerals are more soluble in the presence of higher carbon dioxide (CO2) and lower temperatures. Calcareous speleothems form via carbonate dissolution reactions whereby rainwater reacts with soil CO2 to create weakly acidic water via the reaction:
:H2O + CO2 → H2CO3

As the acidic water travels through the calcium carbonate bedrock from the surface to the cave ceiling, it dissolves the bedrock via the reaction:
:CaCO3 + H2CO3 → Ca2+ + 2 HCO3−

When the solution reaches a cave, the lower pCO2 in the cave drives the precipitation of CaCO3 via the reaction:
:Ca2+ + 2 HCO3− → CaCO3 + H2O + CO2

Over time, the accumulation of these precipitates form dripstones (stalagmites, stalactites), and flowstones, two of the major types of speleothems.

==Climate proxies==
Speleothem transects can provide paleoclimate records similar to those from ice cores or tree rings. Slow geometrical growth and incorporation of radioactive elements enables speleothems to be accurately and precisely dated over much of the late Quaternary by radiocarbon dating and uranium-thorium dating, as long as the cave is a closed system and the speleothem has not undergone recrystallization. Oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13C) stable isotopes are used to track variation in rainfall temperature, precipitation, and vegetation changes over the past ~500,000 years. The Mg/Ca proxy has likewise been used as a moisture indicator, although its reliability as a palaeohygrometer can be affected by cave ventilation during dry seasons. Variations in precipitation alter the width of speleothem rings: closed rings indicates little rainfall, wider spacing indicates heavier rainfall, and denser rings indicate higher moisture. Drip rate counting and trace element analysis of the water drops record short-term climate variations, such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate events. Exceptionally, climate proxy data from the early Permian period have been retrieved from speleothems dated to 289 million years ago sourced from infilled caves exposed by quarrying at the Richards Spur locality in Oklahoma.

==Types and categories==
Speleothems take various forms, depending on whether the water drips, seeps, condenses, flows, or ponds. Many speleothems are named for their resemblance to man-made or natural objects. Types of speleothems include:
* Dripstone is calcium carbonate in the form of stalactites or stalagmites
** Stalactites are pointed pendants hanging from the cave ceiling, from which they grow
*** Soda straws are very thin but long stalactites with an elongated cylindrical shape rather than the usual more conical shape of stalactites
*** Helictites are stalactites that have a central canal with twig-like or spiral projections that appear to defy gravity
**** Include forms known as ribbon helictites, saws, rods, butterflies, hands, curly-fries, and &quot;clumps of worms&quot;
*** Chandeliers are complex clusters of ceiling decorations
*** Ribbon stalactites, or simply &quot;ribbons&quot;, are shaped accordingly
** Stalagmites are the &quot;ground-up&quot; counterparts of stalactites, often blunt mounds
*** Broomstick stalagmites are very tall and spindly
*** Totem pole stalagmites are also tall and shaped like their namesakes
*** Fried egg stalagmites are small, typically wider than they are tall
** Stalagnate results when stalactites and stalagmites meet or when stalactites reach the floor of the cave
* Flowstone is sheet like and found on cave floors and walls
** Draperies or curtains are thin, wavy sheets of calcite hanging downward
*** Bacon is a drapery with variously colored bands within the sheet
** Rimstone dams, or gours, occur at stream ripples and form barriers that may contain water
* Cave crystals
** Dogtooth spar are large calcite crystals often found near seasonal pools
** Frostwork is needle-like growths of calcite or aragonite
** Moonmilk is white and cheese-like
** Anthodites are flower-like clusters of aragonite crystals
** &quot;Cryogenic&quot; calcite crystals are loose grains of calcite found on the floors of caves formed by segregation of solutes during freezing of water.
* Speleogens (technically distinct from speleothems) are formations within caves that are created by the removal of bedrock, rather than as secondary deposits. These include:
** Pillars
** Scallops
** Boneyard
** Boxwork
* Others
** Cave popcorn, also known as &quot;coralloids&quot; or &quot;cave coral&quot;, are small, knobby clusters of calcite
** Cave pearls are the result of water dripping from high above, causing small &quot;seed&quot; crystals to turn over so often that they form into near-perfect spheres of calcium carbonate
** Snottites are colonies of predominantly sulfur oxidizing bacteria and have the consistency of &quot;snot&quot;, or mucus
** Calcite rafts are thin accumulations of calcite that appear on the surface of cave pools
** Hells Bells, a particular speleothem found in the El Zapote cenote of Yucatan in the form of submerged, bell-like shapes
** Lava tubes contain speleothems composed of sulfates, mirabilite or opal. When the lava cools, precipitation occurs.

==Calthemites==
The usual definition of speleothem excludes secondary mineral deposits derived from concrete, lime, mortar, or other calcareous material (e.g. limestone and dolomite) outside the cave environment or in artificial caves (e.g. mines, tunnels), which can have similar shapes and forms as speleothems. Such secondary deposits in man-made structures are termed calthemites. Calthemites are often associated with concrete degradation, or due to leaching of lime, mortar, or other calcareous material.

==Early life and education==
Smits was born in Brooklyn, New York. Smits&#x27;s father, Cornelis Leendert Smits (1929–2015), was from Paramaribo, Suriname, and was of Dutch descent. Smits&#x27;s mother, Emilina (née Pola; 1930–2015), was Puerto Rican, born in Peñuelas. He and his two sisters, Yvonne and Diana, grew up in a working-class neighborhood. When he was ten years old, he moved to Puerto Rico for a couple of years. Until then he did not speak Spanish. He described attending a Spanish-only school as &quot;jarring&quot; and &quot;traumatic.&quot;

Smits was raised in a strict, devout Roman Catholic family. He identifies as Puerto Rican and frequently visits Puerto Rico.

Smits was an athlete in his youth. He graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Brooklyn College in 1980 and an MFA from Cornell University in 1982.

==Career==

One of Smits&#x27;s early roles was playing Sonny Crockett&#x27;s original partner on the first episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; in 1984. In the first five minutes of the episode he falls victim to a car bomb.

Beginning in 1986, Smits played Victor Sifuentes in the first five seasons of the NBC television Steven Bochco legal drama &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, for which he was nominated for six Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, winning in 1990.

Also in 1986, Smits made his feature film debut as drug dealer Julio Gonzalez in the comedy/action cop film &quot;Running Scared&quot; starring Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines. In 1989, Smits had a leading role in the romantic adventure &quot;Old Gringo&quot; as Jane Fonda&#x27;s love interest.

Additionally, Smits played a repairman on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, and he starred in the multigenerational story of a Chicano family in the film &quot;My Family&quot; (1995), alongside Edward James Olmos and Jennifer Lopez.

One of Smits&#x27;s most acclaimed roles was that of Detective Bobby Simone on the ABC television program &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, in which he starred from 1994 to 1998. He received several Emmy nominations for his performance on the series and was reunited with his former co-star Dennis Franz at the 2016 Emmy Awards presentation. He won the ALMA award twice.
Smits was scheduled to host the 2001 Latin Grammy Awards broadcast on September 11, 2001. It was canceled due to continuous news coverage and out of respect for the victims of the terrorist attacks earlier that day. He did host a non-televised press conference to announce the winners.

Smits appeared as Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), in which the character becomes Princess Leia&#x27;s adoptive father.

In &quot;Dexter&quot; season 3, Smits played the role of Miguel Prado, an assistant district attorney who befriends the title character. Smits was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for the role.

Additionally, Smits portrayed the character Alex Vega in the CBS TV series &quot;Cane&quot;, which aired from September 25, 2007, to December 18, 2007, and was subsequently canceled by the network due to the 2007 Screen Writer&#x27;s Guild strike.

Smits joined the &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; cast in season 5 as Nero Padilla, a high-level pimp who refers to himself as a &quot;companionator&quot;. He builds a relationship with Gemma Teller Morrow (Katey Sagal) and forms an alliance and mentorship with Gemma&#x27;s son, the central character Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam).

Smits starred in &quot;The Get Down&quot;, a musical drama television series which debuted in 2016 on Netflix.

On February 25, 2019, news outlets reported that Smits was cast as Elijah Strait in NBC drama series &quot;Bluff City Law&quot; and it was picked up to series on May 6, 2019. &quot;Bluff City Law&quot; brings Smits back to TV courtrooms on a steady basis for the first time in over a quarter century since his role in &quot;L.A. Law.&quot;

<text>The Paleo-Eskimo meaning &quot;old Eskimos&quot;, also known as, pre-Thule or pre-Inuit, were the peoples who inhabited the Arctic region from Chukotka (e.g., Chertov Ovrag) in present-day Russia across North America to Greenland before the arrival of the modern Inuit (Eskimo) and related cultures. The first known Paleo-Eskimo cultures developed by 3900 to 3600 BCE, but were gradually displaced in most of the region, with the last one, the Dorset culture, disappearing around 1500 CE.

Paleo-Eskimo groups included the Pre-Dorset; the Saqqaq culture of Greenland (2500–800 BCE); the Independence I and Independence II cultures of northeastern Canada and Greenland (c. 2400–1800 BCE and c. 800–1 BCE); the Groswater of Labrador, Nunavik, and Newfoundland and the Dorset culture (500 BCE – 1400 CE), which spread across Arctic North America. The Dorset was the last major &quot;Paleo-Eskimo&quot; culture in the Arctic before the migration east from present-day Alaska of the Thule, the ancestors of the modern Inuit.

==Terminology==

The Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) has proposed that scientists use &quot;Inuit&quot; and &quot;Paleo-Inuit&quot; instead of &quot;Eskimo&quot; or &quot;Paleo-Eskimo&quot;. The archaeologist Max Friesen has argued for the ICC&#x27;s terminology to be adopted, and to capitalize the &quot;P&quot; in Paleo, to adhere to archaeological conventions in naming major traditions. In 2016, Lisa Hodgetts and &quot;Arctic&quot; editor Patricia Wells wrote: &quot;In the Canadian context, continued use of any term that incorporates &#x27;Eskimo&#x27; is potentially harmful to the relationships between archaeologists and the Inuit and Inuvialuit communities who are our hosts and increasingly our research partners&quot;; they suggested using more specific terms when possible (e.g., Dorset and Groswater); they also noted replacement for &quot;Palaeoeskimo&quot; was still an open question and discussed &quot;Paleo-Inuit&quot;, &quot;Arctic Small Tool Tradition&quot;, and &quot;pre-Inuit&quot;, as well as Inuktitut loanwords like &quot;&quot;Tuniit&quot; and &quot;Sivullirmiut&quot;&quot; as possibilities. One 2020 paper in &quot;Journal of Anthropological Archaeology&quot;, written by Katelyn Braymer-Hayes and colleagues, notes that there is a &quot;clear need&quot; to replace the term &quot;Paleo-Eskimo&quot;, citing the ICC resolution, but note finding a consensus within the Alaskan context is difficult. In particular, Native Alaskans do not use the word Inuit to describe themselves, and as such, terms used in Canada like &quot;Paleo Inuit&quot; and &quot;Ancestral Inuit&quot; would not be optimal; they use the term &quot;Early Arctic Pottery tradition&quot; while noting a lack of consensus in the field.

==Archaeological cultures==

According to Pavel Flegontov:

===Use of bow and arrows===
The relatively rapid spread of Paleo-Eskimos from Alaska as far as Greenland and Labrador may have been helped by their use of the bow and arrows. They are credited with introducing this technology to populations in Eastern Canada by 2000 BCE.

===Art work===
&quot;First Face&quot; is a paleo-Eskimo carving in the shape of an abstract human face made from walrus ivory that is between 3,900 and 3,600 years old. The artifact was located on Devon Island and is the oldest known depiction of a human face created in North America.

==First ancient human to have genome sequenced==
In February 2010, scientists reported they had performed the first genome sequencing of an ancient human. Using fragments of hair 4,000 years old, the National Museum of Denmark, the Beijing Genomics Institute, and additional collaborating scientific institutions sequenced nearly 80% of a Paleo-Eskimo man&#x27;s genome. The man was found in Greenland and believed to be from the prehistoric Saqqaq culture.

Based on the genome, scientists believe there was a distinct, separate migration of peoples from Siberia to North America some 5,500 years ago. They noted that this was independent of earlier migrations, whose descendants comprised the historic cultures of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, as well as of the later migration by the Inuit. By 4,500 years ago, descendants of this migration had reached Greenland. The remains used for analysis were found in a Saqqaq culture area.

The scientists reported that the man, dubbed &quot;Inuk&quot; (the Inuktitut word for &quot;person&quot;), had A+ blood type and genes suggesting he was adapted to cold weather, had brown eyes, brownish skin, and dark hair, and would have likely balded later in life. This marked the first sequencing of an ancient human&#x27;s genome and the first sequencing of an ancient human&#x27;s mitochondrial genome.

==Paleo-Eskimo, Athabaskans, and Eskimo-Aleut==
A 2017 study identifies Paleo-Eskimo ancestry in Athabaskan and in other Na-Dene-speaking populations. The authors note that the Paleo-Eskimo peoples lived alongside Na-Dene ancestors for millennia. The authors believe that this represents new evidence of a genetic connection between Siberian and Na-Dene populations mediated by Paleo-Eskimos.

According to these scholars, in general, the Paleo-Eskimos had large proportions of Beringian (which includes Chukotko-Kamchatkan and Eskimo-Aleut), Siberian, and Southeast Asian ancestry.

Furthermore, some geneticists and archaeologists, such as David Reich, have hypothesized that the Paleo-Eskimos spread the Na-Dene languages into the American continent, which would make the Paleo-Eskimos cultural and linguistic relatives (if not ancestors) of Na-Dene peoples.

In 2019, scholars concluded that the Palaeo-Eskimo people were the ancestors not only of modern Na-Dene-speaking peoples but also of the Eskimo-Aleut speakers. But this contribution did not come directly; rather, there was a &#x27;Neo-Eskimo&#x27; intermediary.

According to Flegontov et al., the later Old Bering Sea archaeological culture came as a result of back-and-forth migrations across the Bering Strait by the tribes associated with the Arctic Small Tool tradition, or their descendants (Old Whaling, Choris, Norton culture, from 3,100 to 2,500 cal. yr BP). These people were mixing with the Chukotko-Kamchatkan speakers of Siberia. Eventually, the Old Bering Sea archaeological culture became the ancestor of the Yupik and Inuit, the speakers of Eskimo–Aleut languages.

==Genetics==

A genetic study published in &quot;Science&quot; in August 2014 examined the remains of a large number of Paleo-Eskimos and Thule people. Paleo-Eskimos were determined to have largely belonged to the maternal haplogroup D, while Thule people largely belonged to the maternal haplogroups A. The evidence suggested that the ancestors of the Paleo-Eskimos migrated from Siberia to North America in a distinct migration c. 4000 BCE, after which they remained genetically largely isolated. By 1300 CE, the Paleo-Eskimos had been completely replaced by the Thule people (the ancestors of the Inuit), who were descended from people of the Birnirk culture of Siberia.

<doc id="393069" wikidata="Q906456" url="?curid=393069" title="Comparison of topologies">
<text>In topology and related areas of mathematics, the set of all possible topologies on a given set forms a partially ordered set. This order relation can be used for comparison of the topologies.

== Definition ==
A topology on a set may be defined as the collection of subsets which are considered to be &quot;open&quot;. (An alternative definition is that it is the collection of subsets which are considered &quot;closed&quot;. These two ways of defining the topology are essentially equivalent because the complement of an open set is closed and vice versa. In the following, it doesn&#x27;t matter which definition is used.) 

For definiteness the reader should think of a topology as the family of open sets of a topological space, since that is the standard meaning of the word &quot;topology&quot;.

Let &quot;τ&quot;1 and &quot;τ&quot;2 be two topologies on a set &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;τ&quot;1 is contained in &quot;τ&quot;2:
:formula_1.
That is, every element of &quot;τ&quot;1 is also an element of &quot;τ&quot;2. Then the topology &quot;τ&quot;1 is said to be a coarser (weaker or smaller) topology than &quot;τ&quot;2, and &quot;τ&quot;2 is said to be a finer (stronger or larger) topology than &quot;τ&quot;1.
If additionally 
:formula_2
we say &quot;τ&quot;1 is strictly coarser than &quot;τ&quot;2 and &quot;τ&quot;2 is strictly finer than &quot;τ&quot;1.

The binary relation ⊆ defines a partial ordering relation on the set of all possible topologies on &quot;X&quot;.

== Examples ==

The finest topology on &quot;X&quot; is the discrete topology; this topology makes all subsets open. The coarsest topology on &quot;X&quot; is the trivial topology; this topology only admits the empty set
and the whole space as open sets.

In function spaces and spaces of measures there are often a number of possible topologies. See topologies on the set of operators on a Hilbert space for some intricate relationships.

All possible polar topologies on a dual pair are finer than the weak topology and coarser than the strong topology.

The complex vector space C&quot;n&quot; may be equipped with either its usual (Euclidean) topology, or its Zariski topology. In the latter, a subset &quot;V&quot; of C&quot;n&quot; is closed if and only if it consists of all solutions to some system of polynomial equations. Since any such &quot;V&quot; also is a closed set in the ordinary sense, but not &quot;vice versa&quot;, the Zariski topology is strictly weaker than the ordinary one.

== Properties ==

Let &quot;τ&quot;1 and &quot;τ&quot;2 be two topologies on a set &quot;X&quot;. Then the following statements are equivalent:
* &quot;τ&quot;1 ⊆ &quot;τ&quot;2
* the identity map idX : (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;τ&quot;2) → (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;τ&quot;1) is a continuous map.
* the identity map idX : (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;τ&quot;1) → (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;τ&quot;2) is a strongly/relatively open map.

(The identity map idX is surjective and therefore it is strongly open if and only if it is relatively open.)

Two immediate corollaries of the above equivalent statements are
*A continuous map &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; remains continuous if the topology on &quot;Y&quot; becomes &quot;coarser&quot; or the topology on &quot;X&quot; &quot;finer&quot;.
*An open (resp. closed) map &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; remains open (resp. closed) if the topology on &quot;Y&quot; becomes &quot;finer&quot; or the topology on &quot;X&quot; &quot;coarser&quot;.

One can also compare topologies using neighborhood bases. Let &quot;τ&quot;1 and &quot;τ&quot;2 be two topologies on a set &quot;X&quot; and let &quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) be a local base for the topology &quot;τ&quot;&quot;i&quot; at &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; for &quot;i&quot; = 1,2. Then &quot;τ&quot;1 ⊆ &quot;τ&quot;2 if and only if for all &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, each open set &quot;U&quot;1 in &quot;B&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;) contains some open set &quot;U&quot;2 in &quot;B&quot;2(&quot;x&quot;). Intuitively, this makes sense: a finer topology should have smaller neighborhoods.

==Lattice of topologies==

The set of all topologies on a set &quot;X&quot; together with the partial ordering relation ⊆ forms a complete lattice that is also closed under arbitrary intersections. That is, any collection of topologies on &quot;X&quot; have a &quot;meet&quot; (or infimum) and a &quot;join&quot; (or supremum). The meet of a collection of topologies is the intersection of those topologies. The join, however, is not generally the union of those topologies (the union of two topologies need not be a topology) but rather the topology generated by the union.

Every complete lattice is also a bounded lattice, which is to say that it has a greatest and least element. In the case of topologies, the greatest element is the discrete topology and the least element is the trivial topology.

The lattice of topologies on a set formula_3 is a complemented lattice; that is, given a topology formula_4 on formula_3 there exists a topology formula_6 on formula_3 such that the intersection formula_8 is the trivial topology and the topology generated by the union formula_9 is the discrete topology.

If the set formula_3 has at least three elements, the lattice of topologies on formula_3 is not modular, and hence not distributive either.

==Education==
Samcheok has one university, KNU Samcheok Campus, established March 1, 2006. (formerly Samcheok National University)

==Climate==
Located on the Taebaek Mountains and the east coast, it has a mild and humid climate characterized by an Oceanic climate, and the vertical temperature distribution due to the influence of the high mountains can be seen in the neighboring mountains, and the temperature difference between the eastern and inland regions is about 30 days. The maritime climate is mild, with seasonal cold and turbulent currents, and fish resources are abundant.

The average temperature over the past 12 years is 12.5 °C, which is somewhat higher than other provinces in the Yeongseo region. The highest temperature was 37.5 °C on July 29, 1992, and the lowest temperature was -13.5 °C on January 26, 1990.

The temperature distribution shows an average of 24.1 °C in August and an average of 0.5 °C in January, indicating cooler summers and milder winters. Precipitation averages 1,284.5 mm per year, with more than 50% of the precipitation falling in July–August, with rainfall concentrated in the summer. The maximum daily precipitation was 819 mm (Nogok) during the heavy rainfall caused by Typhoon Rusa on August 31-September 1, 2002 (2 days). Due to the influence of the northeasterly winds, it snows heavily in winter, sometimes even in March and April. It is the most specialized climate in Korea.

<text>The Volvo P1800 (pronounced &quot;eighteen-hundred&quot;) is a 2+2, front-engine, rear-drive sports car manufactured and marketed by Volvo Cars between 1961 and 1973. Originally a coupé (1961–1972), it was also offered in a shooting brake configuration toward the end of its production (1972–1973). Styling was by Pelle Petterson under the tutelage of Pietro Frua when Frua&#x27;s studio was a subsidiary of the Italian carrozzeria Ghia, and the mechanicals were derived from Volvo&#x27;s Amazon/122 series.

Marketed as a touring car rather than a sports car, the P1800 became widely known when driven by British actor Roger Moore in the television series &quot;The Saint&quot;, which aired from 1962 to 1969.

In 1998, an 1800S owned by Irv Gordon (1940–2018) was certified as the highest mileage private vehicle driven by the original owner in non-commercial service—having exceeded 3.25 million miles (over 5.23 million km) as of his death in 2018.

==History==

The project was originally started in 1957 because Volvo wanted a sports car to compete in the US &amp; European markets, despite the fact that their previous attempt, the P1900, had failed to take off with only 68 cars sold. The man behind the project was an engineering consultant to Volvo, Helmer Petterson, who in the 1940s was responsible for the Volvo PV444. Unknown to him, design work was done by his son Pelle, under the tutelage of Italian auto stylist Pietro Frua while Frua&#x27;s studio as a subsidiary of the prestigious carrozzeria Ghia. Volvo insisted it was an Italian design by Frua and only officially recognized Pelle Petterson&#x27;s authorship in 2009. Carrozzeria Frua built the first three prototypes between September 1957 and early 1958, later designated by Volvo in September 1958: P958-X1, P958-X2 and P958-X3 (P:Project, 9:September, 58:Year 1958 = P958, X: eXperimental).
In December 1957 Helmer Petterson drove X1, (the first hand-built P1800 prototype) to Osnabrück, West Germany, headquarters of Karmann. Petterson hoped that Karmann would be able to take on the tooling and building of the P1800. Karmann&#x27;s engineers had already been preparing working drawings from the wooden styling buck at Frua. Petterson and Volvo chief engineer Thor Berthelius met there, tested the car and discussed the construction with Karmann. They were ready to build it and this meant that the first cars could hit the market as early as December 1958. But in February, Karmann&#x27;s most important customer, Volkswagen, forbade Karmann to take on the job. They feared that the P1800 would compete with the sales of their own cars, and threatened to cancel all their contracts with Karmann if they took on this car. This setback almost caused the project to be abandoned.

Other German firms, NSU, Drauz and Hanomag, were contacted but none was chosen because Volvo did not believe they met Volvo&#x27;s manufacturing quality-control standards.

It began to appear that Volvo might never produce the P1800. This motivated Helmer Petterson to obtain financial backing from two financial firms with the intention of buying the components directly from Volvo and marketing the car himself. At this point, Volvo had made no mention of the P1800 and the factory would not comment. Then a press release surfaced with a photo of the car, putting Volvo in a position where they had to acknowledge its existence. These events influenced the company to renew its efforts: the car was presented to the public for the first time at the Brussels Motor Show in January 1960 and Volvo turned to Jensen Motors, whose production lines were under-utilised, and they agreed on a contract for 10,000 cars. The Linwood, Scotland, body plant of manufacturer Pressed Steel was in turn sub-contracted by Jensen to create the unibody shells, which were then taken by rail to be assembled at Jensen in West Bromwich, England. In September 1960, the first production P1800 (for the 1961 model year) left Jensen.

===P1800===
The engine was the B18 (&quot;B&quot; for the Swedish word for gasoline: Bensin; &quot;18&quot; for 1800 cc displacement) with dual SU carburettors, producing 100 hp (75 kW). This variant (named B18B) had a higher compression ratio than the slightly less powerful twin-carb B18D used in the contemporary Amazon 122S, as well as a different camshaft. Some have suggested that the B18 was developed from the B36 V8 engine used in Volvo trucks, but differences between the engines cause others to dispute that origin. The B18 furnished the P1800 with a strong engine boasting five main crankshaft bearings. The B18 was matched with the new and more robust M40 manual gearbox through 1963. From 1963 to 1972 the M41 gearbox with electrically actuated Laycock de Normanville overdrive was a popular option. Two overdrive types were used, the D-Type through 1969, and the J-type through 1973. The J-type had a slightly shorter ratio of 0.797:1 as opposed to 0.756:1 for the D-type. The overdrive effectively gave the 1800 series a fifth gear, for improved fuel efficiency and decreased drivetrain wear. Cars without overdrive had a numerically lower-ratio differential, which had the effect of giving them a slightly higher top speed (just under ) than the more popular overdrive models. This was because the non-overdrive cars could reach the engine&#x27;s redline in top gear, while the overdrive-equipped cars could not, giving them a top speed of roughly .

===1800S===

As time progressed, Jensen had problems with quality control, so the contract was ended early after 6,000 cars had been built. In 1963 production was moved to Volvo&#x27;s Lundby Plant in Gothenburg and the car&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;1800S&quot; (S standing for Sverige, or in English: Sweden). The engine was improved with an additional . In 1966 the four-cylinder engine was updated to . Top speed was . In 1969 the B18 engine was replaced with the 2-litre B20B variant of the B20 giving , though it kept the designation 1800S.

===1800E===

For 1970 numerous changes came with the fuel-injected 1800E (the &#x27;E&#x27; stands for &quot;Einspritzung&quot;, the German word for fuel injection), which had the B20E engine with Bosch D-Jetronic fuel injection and a revised camshaft, and produced without sacrificing fuel economy. Top speed was around and acceleration from 0–100 km/h (0–62.1 mph) took 9.5 seconds. In addition, the 1970 model was the first 1800 with four-wheel disc brakes; until then the 1800 series had front discs and rear drums. In 1972 a lower compression B20F engine was introduced for specific markets to meet emission standards, mainly for the US. Along with the new &quot;F&quot; head, the ECU, manifold pressure sensor, and head gasket were also changed for all cars with B20F engine.

===1800ES===
Volvo introduced its final P1800 variant, the &quot;1800ES&quot;, in 1972 as a two-door shooting brake layout with a frameless, all-glass tailgate. The final design was chosen after two prototypes had been built by Sergio Coggiola and Pietro Frua. Frua&#x27;s prototype, &quot;Raketen&quot; (&quot;the Rocket&quot;), is in the Volvo Museum. Both Italian prototypes were considered too futuristic, and instead in-house designer Jan Wilsgaard&#x27;s proposal, the Beach Car, was accepted. The ES engine was downgraded to by reducing the compression ratio with a thicker head gasket (engine variant B20F); although maximum power was slightly down the engine was less &quot;peaky&quot; and the car&#x27;s on-the-road performance was actually improved.

 The ES&#x27;s rear backrest folded down to create a long flat loading area. As an alternative to the usual four-speed plus overdrive manual transmission, a Borg-Warner three-speed automatic was available in the 1800ES. With stricter American safety and emissions standards looming for 1974, Volvo did not see fit to spend the considerable amount that would be necessary to redesign the small-volume 1800 ES. Only 8,077 examples of the ES were built in its two model years.


====Influence====
The all-glass rear hatch of the ES-model proved to be very popular with future Volvo-designers. Similar designs were used on the Volvo 480, on multiple concept cars and on the Volvo C30.

====End of the line====
For the last model year, 1973, only the 1800ES wagon was produced. Total production of the 1800 line from 1961 through 1973 was 47,492 units. Production ended on 27 June 1973, although Volvo was in negotiations with Coggiola concerning a possible &quot;P1800ESC&quot;. The Volvo 262C coupé was an indirect successor.

Volvo never produced a convertible version of the 1800, but such cars were produced in the aftermarket most notably by Volvoville of New York, who offered them through their dealership after locally modifying stock coupes. Between 1964 and 1969 Volvoville sold some 30 convertible P1800. The list price for a 1800S was US$3,695 and the convertible cost US$1,000 more. Volvo in Gothenburg was not amused over the name or the convertible so it ended with a compromise where Volvoville got to keep the name, but stop making convertibles.

In Sweden the P1800ES was nicknamed Fiskbilen (The Fish van); in Germany and Switzerland it was nicknamed Schneewittchensarg (Snow White&#x27;s coffin), because of the all-glass rear hatch.

==Popular notoriety==

The Volvo P1800 received prominence in the early 1960s when a white 1962 Volvo P1800 with number plate ST1 was driven by the character Simon Templar (Roger Moore) in the TV series &quot;The Saint&quot; (1962–1969). The car became intimately linked to the show and helped raise Volvo&#x27;s profile at the time.

Roger Moore actually purchased a P1800 of his own, in the same white color as the TV car, and so was seen driving the Volvo both on-screen and around the roads of Britain.

Two new cars had been introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 1961, a Jaguar E-Type and the Volvo P1800. Jaguar was first offered the opportunity to provide an E-Type for the TV series but declined. Volvo accepted and offered a P1800, leading to increased sales. Initially, Volvo lent two cars for the series, one for static studio shots and the other for moving shots. When the P1800S came along, one of the earlier cars was cut up to allow better interior shots.

Major Samantha Carter drove a silver-grey 1963 Volvo P1800 in the TV series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (1997–2007), as first seen in S05E03 &quot;Ascension&quot;.

In the 2023 Goosebumps Series, Nathan Bratt (played by Justin Long), the new English teacher at Port Lawrence High School, drives a red 1800ES shooting brake.

==50th anniversary==
The 50th anniversary of the P1800 took place in France on 13 June 2010 during the Viking Classic Auto Show, celebrating the first presentation of the P1800 to the public at the Brussels Motor Show in 1960. The show featured more than 350 Volvo cars, about 80 Volvo P1800s Europe as well as the original prototype P958-X1 — along with designer Pelle Petterson as well as Irv Gordon. The event was promoted by Volvo Cars Heritage.

==Mileage record==
A 1966 Volvo P1800S and its owner Irv Gordon (1940–2018) of East Patchogue, New York, have the Guinness world record for highest mileage. Gordon began driving the car in 1966, and in 1987 the car reached the one million mile mark. In 1998, it was registered as the vehicle with the highest certified mileage driven by the original owner in non-commercial service, by the Guinness Book of World Records, with a total of .

On 2 April 2002, Gordon and his P1800S were guests on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, after reaching the two million mile mark.

In January 2011, Gordon and his Volvo were featured on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Nova ScienceNow&quot; and in November 2011 in &quot;Hemmings Sports &amp; Exotic Magazine.&quot;

In June 2013, when the car had reached a little over , Volvo Cars North America (VCNA) launched an unprecedented PR campaign valuing the performance and in September 2013 the car surpassed the 3 million mile mark in Alaska.

When Irv Gordon died, on 15 November 2018, the car had driven more than .

<doc id="393079" wikidata="Q917474" url="?curid=393079" title="Hugh Town">
<text>Hugh Town ( or ) is the largest settlement on the Isles of Scilly and its administrative centre. The town is situated on the island of St Mary&#x27;s, the largest and most populous island in the archipelago, and is located on a narrow isthmus which joins the peninsula known as the Garrison (historically the Hugh) with the rest of the island.

The population recorded by the 2011 census was 1,097 (up from 1,068 in 2001). Unlike the rest of the Isles of Scilly, the freehold title to land in the town is &quot;not&quot; held by the Duchy of Cornwall — in 1949 it was sold to the inhabitants. The harbour, however, continues to be owned and run by the Duchy.

Hugh Town becomes particularly busy during the May Day bank holiday weekend (the first weekend in May) when the World Pilot Gig Championships are held. The competing teams base themselves in the several bays of St Mary&#x27;s Pool (the large natural bay to the north of Hugh Town) and the numerous races finish at the end of the harbour quay.

==History==
The name Hugh is derived from an Old English word &#x27;hoh&#x27; meaning a promontory or elevated ground. The Garrison was originally known as The Hugh or Hugh Hill. The same word is used in Plymouth Hoe and Hoe Point on Gugh. Cemeteries containing native British people were found in 1949 and 1960 on the Porthcress side of the town, when housing was built. The remains are dated from the 1st to 4th century. A Roman altar was found on The Garrison in the 19th century and is now in Tresco Abbey Gardens. The area has not been excavated so there may be an undiscovered shrine or temple. During medieval times Old Town was the main centre of population but from the 17th century onwards, due to its sheltered harbour, Hugh Town began to grow. Star Castle was built in 1593, the quay in 1601 and in the 18th century, as the military defences increased, The Hugh became known as The Garrison. In 1920 two football teams were founded: Woolpack Wanderers and Garrison Gunners.

==Amenities and landmarks==
Hugh Street is the main shopping area on the islands and business is quite reliant on tourism. There are several pubs, restaurants and hotels, as well as a bank and a post office. In 2021 it was announced that the bank would close in 2022. A notable building is the Star Castle, which overlooks the town from The Garrison and is now a hotel. Similarly, Tregarthen&#x27;s Hotel is a Hugh Town landmark. It was originally the home of Captain Frank Tregarthen who introduced the first sloop in 1849, &#x27;Ariadne&#x27;, that serviced the Hugh Town from Penzance. Being on an isthmus, there are two beaches, the northern one (Town Beach) being along the bay which forms the island&#x27;s main harbour; the southern beach and bay is named Porthcressa.

The Council of the Isles of Scilly is based at the Isles of Scilly Town Hall, a grade II listed building located at The Parade, a small park situated at the centre of the isthmus (and originally a parade ground). The Duchy of Cornwall, which owns almost all the freehold land in the Isles of Scilly, as well as being the port authority, has its Isles of Scilly offices at Hugh House, located within the Garrison walls.

The Church of England&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s Church, the islands&#x27; Roman Catholic Church and St Mary&#x27;s Methodist Church are all located on or near Church Street. The Isles of Scilly Museum, previously located on Church Street, is now located at the Town Hall. The town has a public library and a police station. On the eastern outskirts of the town (heading towards Peninnis Head) are the NHS community hospital and local health centre, as well as other important public amenities such as the island&#x27;s power station, the island&#x27;s refuse depot and the town&#x27;s fire station. The island&#x27;s primary and secondary schools (both part of the Five Islands Academy) are situated to the southeast of the town, at Carn Gwaval, on the road to Old Town.

The island&#x27;s airport is located approximately to the east of the centre of Hugh Town.

The Isles of Scilly Museum was housed in a purpose-built building which was declared unsafe in 2019, and is now partly accommodated in the Town Hall. There is a plan to convert the Town Hall building to form the Isles of Scilly Cultural Centre and Museum, to open in 2025/26.

==Climate==

The Islands boast amongst the mildest and warmest climate in the UK. Often referred to as the sunshine isles, they benefit from more hours of sunshine than other regions - averaging 7.6 hours a day in July. 
As with most of the British Isles, Hugh Town experiences a maritime climate (Cfb) with mild summers and cool winters, however temperatures rarely dip below freezing.
==Harbour==
The principal harbour of the Isles of Scilly (known as St Mary&#x27;s Harbour) is located on the northern edge of the town, naturally formed by the bay at Town Beach (itself part of a larger bay named St Mary&#x27;s Pool) and improved by the construction of a quay on its western side, which acts also as a breakwater. The quay is the terminal of the ferry to Penzance, currently the &quot;Scillonian III&quot;, and the cargo vessel &quot;Gry Maritha&quot;; both vessels have St Mary&#x27;s as their port of registry. The Duchy of Cornwall is the owner and the harbour authority (the St Mary&#x27;s Harbour and Pilotage Authority).

The original quay was built in 1593 and an extension (or offshoot) began in 1836 to Rat Island under a contract of £4,000 to William Martin of Penzance. Martin resigned in November 1837 and Augustus Smith organised the completion. The enlargement of the harbour produced an increase in harbour dues as larger and deeper-draughted boats were now able to dock for loading, unloading, repairs or victualling. In 1889, Smith&#x27;s successor Thomas Smith-Dorrien-Smith extended the pier a further 250 feet eastwards, at his own expense, so that the West Cornwall Steam Ship Company ships could dock. Despite Parliamentary opposition, a Pier and Harbour Provisional Order Bill passed in June 1890 gave him revenue from the harbour dues.

The quay was extended by a further 23 metres (25 yards) in 2015, with new passenger and freight facilities being constructed too. The extension to the quay allows for vessels of a greater draft (up to 3.9 metres; 12&#x27;9&quot;). A small amount of land reclamation took place by Rat Island too, enlarging the space around the buildings there.

Improvements to the quay, including a boardwalk to improve pedestrian access to the quay, were announced in 2021 as part of the levelling up funding granted to the islands.

===Lifeboat station===
On the eastern end of Town Beach (on the rocky outcrop known as Carn Thomas) is the St Mary&#x27;s Lifeboat Station, first operated in 1837 and run by the RNLI.

<text>Eton ( ) is a town in Berkshire, England, on the opposite bank of the River Thames to Windsor, connected to it by Windsor Bridge. The civil parish, which also includes the village of Eton Wick two miles west of the town, had a population of 4,692 at the 2011 census. Within the boundaries of the historic county of Buckinghamshire, in 1974 it came under the administration of Berkshire following the Local Government Act 1972; since 1998 it has been part of the unitary authority of Windsor and Maidenhead. The town is best known as the location of Eton College.

Eton is on the Thames Path as you walk or cycle from Maidenhead to Windsor. 

Eton is also home to Swan Lifeline, the oldest registered swan rescue and treatment charity devoted entirely to the care of sick and injured swans in the Thames Valley and surrounding areas, on the Cuckoo Weir Island, patronised by George Michael and Michael Parkinson. 

==History==

The name derives from Old English &quot;Ēa-tūn&quot;, meaning &quot;River-Town&quot;, a reference to Eton&#x27;s proximity to the River Thames. The land that is now Eton once belonged to the manor of Queen Edith, wife of Edward the Confessor. The land was appropriated by the Normans after 1066; and by 1086, the lord was Walter son of Other. The main road between Windsor and London went through the area and a hamlet sprang up amid pasture meadows to maintain the road and the bridge. In 1440, Henry VI chose Eton as the location for his new college, Eton College. Workmen were moved into Eton to build the college. All of the land immediately around the hamlet was granted to the college, which stopped further growth. The new college chapel made the village a pilgrimage point, and inns were set up along the High Street. Henry VI gave the college the right to hold fairs on its grounds. 

During the English Civil War, after Windsor Castle was captured by Parliamentarian forces, the Royalist army moved into Eton and attempted to retake the town, occupying the college. Efforts to retake Windsor were unsuccessful and the royalists eventually fled. In 1812, Porny&#x27;s charity school was founded by the estate of the late Antoine Pyron du Martré, otherwise Mark Anthony Porny, French master at Eton College. Later named Eton Porny, it became the school for local children at 29 High Street. In 1863, moving to the school&#x27;s current site at 14 High Street Eton. The population was 3,526 by 1841. The college sometimes leased small plots of land to the village as an act of charity, leading to the construction of houses near the bridge. Scholars at the college also used to collect &quot;salt&quot; (money) from the inns of Eton High Street. 

This practice continued until 1845 when a scholar refused to associate with the inns because they were a &quot;temptation&quot; to Eton students. Eton was favourably modernised and was the first village in the UK to have its own post office and modern drainage system. By 1925 the town was described as more commercial than residential, with most of the buildings (apart from those of the school itself) belonging to businesses serving the schoolboys. In April 1970, Windsor Bridge, connecting Eton to Windsor, was closed to all motorised traffic. All traffic must now travel via Royal Windsor Way (formerly the Windsor and Eton relief road), a bypass opened in 1966.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Eton, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Eton Town Council and Windsor and Maidenhead Borough Council.

At the parish level, the town is represented by seven councillors in the Eton Town Council, a body which also includes seven councillors representing Eton Wick. At the district level, the town is part of the Eton and Castle electoral ward of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.

Nationally, since 1997 the ward has formed part of the UK Parliamentary constituency of Windsor and is currently represented by Jack Rankin of the Conservative Party. 

Between 1983 and 1997, the town was part of the UK Parliamentary constituency of Windsor and Maidenhead, which was held by the Conservative Party throughout that period. Before 1983, the town was within the boundaries of the UK Parliamentary constituency of Eton and Slough. This was held by the Labour Party from its creation in 1945 to its redistribution in 1983, except between 1964 and 1966 when it was held by a Conservative.
===Administrative history===

Eton was governed by a local board from 1849 to 1894, and by an urban district council from 1894 to 1974. Eton Urban District Council was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area being transferred from Buckinghamshire to Berkshire on 1 April 1974 to become part of the new district of Windsor and Maidenhead. A successor parish was created to cover the former Eton Urban District, which had covered both the town itself and Eton Wick. The parish council adopted the name Eton Town Council. It is based at 102 High Street.

==Transport==
===Bus===
Eton is served by two bus companies. Thames Valley Buses operates Monday to Saturday buses on the Slough – Eton – Eton Wick – Taplow – Maidenhead route (bus 15). Redline Buses operates the Slough – Eton – Eton Wick – Dorney – Maidenhead route on Tuesdays and Fridays (bus 63/68).

<doc id="393082" wikidata="Q7940093" url="?curid=393082" title="Volcanism of Java">
<text>The Indonesian island of Java is almost entirely of volcanic origin, and contains numerous volcanoes, 45 of which are considered active volcanoes. As is the case for many other Indonesian islands, volcanoes have played a vital role in the geological and human history of Java. Indeed, land is created on Java as a result of lava flows, ash deposits, and mud flows (&quot;lahars&quot;). Volcanoes are a major contributor to the immense fertility of Java, as natural erosion transports volcanic material as alluvium to the island&#x27;s plains, forming thick layers of fertile sediment. The benefit is not just in the immediate vicinity of the volcano, with fine ash emitted from eruptions being dispersed over wide areas.

Climbing volcanoes (and other mountains) is increasingly popular.

== List of volcanoes ==

<text>Cardiacs are an English rock band formed in Kingston upon Thames by Tim Smith (guitar and lead vocals) and his brother Jim (bass, backing vocals) in 1977 under the name Cardiac Arrest. One of Britain&#x27;s leading cult rock bands, Cardiacs&#x27; sound folded in genres including art rock, progressive rock, art punk, post-punk, jazz, psychedelia and heavy metal (as well as elements of circus, baroque pop, medieval music, nursery rhymes and sea shanties), all of which was topped by Smith&#x27;s anarchic vocals and hard-to-decipher lyrics. The band&#x27;s theatrical performance style often incorporated off-putting costumes and make-up, complete with on-stage confrontations. Their sound and image made them unpopular with the press, but they amassed a devoted following.

Tim Smith was the primary songwriter, noted for his complex and innovative compositional style. He and his brother were the only constant members in the band&#x27;s regularly changing lineup. The band created their own indie label, the Alphabet Business Concern, in 1984 and found mainstream exposure with the single &quot;Is This the Life?&quot; from their debut album &quot;A Little Man and a House and the Whole World Window&quot; (1988). Their second album, &quot;On Land and in the Sea&quot; (1989), was followed by &quot;Heaven Born and Ever Bright&quot; (1992), which displayed a harder edged, metal-leaning sound retained in the subsequent albums &quot;Sing to God&quot; (1996) and &quot;Guns&quot; (1999). The final Cardiacs album, &quot;LSD&quot;, was left unfinished after Tim Smith was hospitalised with dystonia resulting from a cardiac arrest and stroke in 2008, which caused the band to go on hiatus indefinitely.

Smith&#x27;s illness brought increased and belated critical recognition to Cardiacs, with several music outlets calling &quot;Sing to God&quot; a masterpiece. His death in 2020 saw a raft of tributes on social media. Many rock groups including Blur were influenced by Cardiacs&#x27; eclectic music, which appeared on streaming services in 2021. Alternately billed as &quot;Cardiacs&quot;, &quot;The Cardiacs&quot;, and &quot;Cardiacs Family &amp; Friends&quot;, Cardiacs members &quot;past, present, and future&quot; performed the music of Tim Smith at several sold-out gigs in 2024.

== History ==

=== 1977–1984: Early years ===

Cardiacs originated in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, in the late 1970s. Frontman Tim Smith began his musical career in 1975 after forming a nameless band at school in which he played guitar. Smith played his first gig at Surbiton Assembly Rooms aged 16 alongside Adrian Borland of the Outsiders and drummer Bruce Bisland as Gazunder. The Cardiacs biography describes their two gigs in 1976 as sounding &quot;a bit like the rocky instrumental bits&quot; on David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (1970). The band that would become Cardiacs was formed in late 1977 by Smith and his brother Jim on bass guitar and backing vocals, alongside Michael Pugh on lead vocals and Peter Tagg on drums. The project was initially called the Filth, but soon changed their name to Cardiac Arrest. According to the official history, Tim Smith formed the band merely to punish his brother &quot;for all the unkind things he would do to him as an infant&quot;, as Jim allegedly couldn&#x27;t play an instrument.

Cardiac Arrest produced a demo in 1977, and released their debut single &quot;A Bus for a Bus on the Bus&quot; in 1979 under Tortch Records. Smith, the primary lyricist, initially took on guitar and backing vocal duties before Pugh&#x27;s departure saw him promoted to frontman. Cardiac Arrest followed the single with a full-length cassette release titled &quot;The Obvious Identity&quot; in 1980, which was released at around 1000 copies exclusively sold at concerts. Shortly after, the group went through a number of name changes, settling on simply Cardiacs in 1981. They held their first concert under the new name in April.

In 1981, Cardiacs self-released the cassette album, &quot;Toy World&quot;, featuring both new material and recordings dating back to the Cardiac Arrest period. (Consequently, some tracks featured Michael Pugh as lead singer rather than Tim Smith). During 1981, Colvin Mayers left the band to join the Sound, a group led by Borland. Sarah Cutts briefly covered live keyboards as well as saxophone, before Mark Cawthra swapped drums for keyboards and Dominic Luckman was recruited from the road crew as the new drummer. At around the same time percussionist Tim Quy became a full-time member (also doubling on bass synthesizer). In July 1983, Tim Smith married Sarah Cutts – taking his surname, she was henceforward known as Sarah Smith.

In mid-1983 Mark Cawthra left the band, to be replaced on keyboards by William D. Drake. Tim Smith had previously met Drake in 1982 at the debut performance of Drake&#x27;s band Honour Our Trumpet (who promptly invited him to join as bass guitarist.) Following Cawthra&#x27;s departure, Smith returned Drake&#x27;s favour by inviting him to join Cardiacs. Drake played his first concert with the band on 31 August 1983. Later in the year, Cardiacs added Marguerite Johnston (alto saxophone) and Graham Simmonds (guitar), and for about a year the band worked as an octet. Both Johnston and Simmonds left during the following summer (in July and August respectively), although Simmonds stayed on as Cardiacs&#x27; sound engineer. At some point in 1983, Tim Smith produced two issues of a comic alternatively called &quot;Peter and His Dog&quot; and &quot;Peter and His Dog Spot&quot;.

=== 1984–1989: The &quot;classic lineup&quot; established ===

==== &quot;The Seaside&quot; and &quot;Seaside Treats&quot; ====

By autumn 1984, the band lineup had settled as the sextet generally referred to as &quot;the classic lineup&quot; – Tim Smith (lead vocals and guitar), Jim Smith (bass and vocals), William D. Drake (keyboards and vocals), Sarah Smith (saxophones and vocals), Tim Quy (percussion and keyboards) and Dominic Luckman (drums). The first Cardiacs release featuring the &quot;classic&quot; lineup was their third album, &quot;The Seaside&quot; (although Cawthra featured throughout on drums, keyboards and voice; and Simmonds and Johnston also appeared on several tracks). The album was released on Cardiacs own record label, Alphabet (which later became Alphabet Business Concern). The bizarre and sinister &quot;Alphabet Business Concern&quot; mythology now began to become a significant part of Cardiacs&#x27; artistic presentation, and the band members would promote and add to it at every opportunity. The band evolved an elaborate and theatrical stage show, involving off-putting &quot;bandsmen&#x27;s uniforms, makeup, Sarah&#x27;s music stand, (and) Tim&#x27;s mile-wide grin&quot;.

Between 5 November – 21 December 1984, Cardiacs performed their first major British support tour, supporting Marillion at the personal invitation of Marillion&#x27;s vocalist, Fish. Whilst the tour afforded the band a new level of publicity, generally they were not well received by Marillion&#x27;s fanbase. On most dates of the tour, the band was pelted with a variety of makeshift missiles. During the 13 December show at the Hammersmith Apollo, Fish himself was indignant enough about the Marillion fans and their hostile behaviour to come onstage during Cardiacs&#x27; set and berate the audience about it. The band eventually ducked out of the last three days of the Marillion tour.

A Cardiacs spin-off project – Mr and Mrs Smith and Mr Drake – emerged in 1984. As the name suggests, this featured Tim and Sarah Smith plus William D. Drake and consisted of a quieter, more acoustically-orientated take on Cardiacs&#x27; music. The project released a self-titled cassette album which was only available via the Cardiacs fan club. Later on, the project would be renamed the Sea Nymphs.

On 1 April 1985, an attempt was made to film Cardiacs at a live concert at the Surbiton Assembly Rooms. The band had been approached by film-maker Mark Francombe (later a member of Cranes) and his colleague Nick Elborough, both of whom were at that time students at Portsmouth College of Art and Design. Francombe and Elborough offered to film the band for free as part of their coursework project. However, when the band viewed the resultant footage, they decided against releasing it. Instead, they retained Francombe and Elborough for a new video project which would become &quot;Seaside Treats&quot;, named after the 12&quot; single that was released at the same time. As well as containing three music videos, &quot;Seaside Treats&quot; contained a ten-minute film named &quot;The Consultant&#x27;s Flower Garden&quot;. The latter featured Cardiacs (and various people connected with them) in bizarre, comedic situations which continued to propagate the absurdist Alphabet Business Concern mythology which surrounded the band.

==== &quot;Big Ship&quot;, &quot;A Little Man and a House&quot; &amp; &quot;On Land and in the Sea&quot; ====

Cardiacs played the Reading Festival on 24 August 1986, releasing the very rough audio footage as the &quot;Rude Bootleg&quot; album. On 27 January 1987, Cardiacs released the mini-album &quot;Big Ship&quot;, the first studio release by the sextet, to mixed reviews. The title track would prove to be one of their most enduring anthems.
In March 1987, the British tabloid newspaper &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; ran a story claiming to be an exposé and revealing the supposedly incestuous relationship between Tim Smith and Sarah Smith, in which the couple were portrayed as brother and sister. The headline ran, &quot;In their bizarre world of music... anything goes – even incest.&quot; (The article ultimately debunked the story by including a corrective quote from Tim Smith&#x27;s mother). Band manager Mark Walmesley is thought to have started the whole rumour to gain some publicity for the band, predating the superficially similar strategy later employed by the White Stripes twelve years later.

On 17 April, the band&#x27;s music video for &quot;Tarred and Feathered&quot; (from the &quot;Big Ship&quot; mini-album) was broadcast on Channel 4&#x27;s groundbreaking music show &quot;The Tube&quot;, giving Cardiacs their first exposure on national television. Later in the year, Cardiacs released a 12-inch single called &quot;There&#x27;s Too Many Irons in the Fire&quot;. In October, a live-in-the-studio session was recorded and broadcast by BBC Radio Leeds, followed in December by a similar session on BBC Radio 1 for Janice Long&#x27;s &quot;Night Track&quot; show.

In 1988, Cardiacs released their debut studio album proper, &quot;A Little Man and a House and the Whole World Window&quot;. The single from the album, &quot;Is This the Life?&quot;, saw brief chart success due to exposure on mainstream radio, and garnered the attention of a wider audience when it entered the Independent Top 10 in the UK. The band followed up this burst of success with another single, a cover of the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Susannah&#x27;s Still Alive&quot; with a video directed by Steve Payne. Strange Fruit Records also released a 12-inch vinyl EP of the band&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 session from the previous year, under the title &quot;Night Tracks (The Janice Long Session)&quot;. By this time, Cardiacs concerts were drawing hundreds of audience members and they were well on their way to becoming a hit underground band. On 15 May, the band played a concert at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, which was recorded for later release as &quot;Cardiacs Live&quot;.

Later in the year, Cardiacs recorded tracks for what would become their fifth studio album, &quot;On Land and in the Sea&quot; which was released in 1989. The album successfully consolidated the intricate style and unusual songwriting vision of &quot;A Little Man and a House...&quot;, but the stable lineup which the band had enjoyed for four years was now beginning to weaken.

=== 1989–1999: Classic lineup fractures and power quartet established ===

==== &quot;All That Glitters Is a Mares Nest&quot; and multiple departures ====

Over the following two years, the Cardiacs lineup began to disintegrate. Sarah Smith left the band suddenly in April 1989 and was not replaced, removing saxophone from the standard Cardiacs sound. Although Sarah would not rejoin the band, she would retain a long-term connection with Cardiacs by playing on future albums and would very occasionally appear as a special guest for live concerts. Tim Smith brought in a second guitarist – Christian &#x27;Bic&#x27; Hayes, formerly of the Cardiacs-inspired Ring and the Dave Howard Singers – and the new two-guitar lineup toured extensively around the UK and Europe for the rest of the year (with Sarah Smith making the first of her special guest appearances at a Brixton Fridge concert on 17 September). During this period, the band also released &quot;Archive Cardiacs&quot;, a collection of material from the 1976–83 period (some of it previously unreleased).

Cardiacs toured and gigged intermittently during 1990, culminating in a shared concert with Napalm Death at Salisbury Arts Centre on 30 June. The Cardiacs half of the concert was filmed and released as the video &quot;Maresnest&quot; (produced by Steve Mallet and directed by Steve Payne, and eventually also released as the 1995 live album &quot;All that Glitters is a Mares Nest&quot;). The band performed as a seven-piece, with Sarah Smith making a one-day return as a band member. Although the concert has achieved legendary status amongst Cardiacs fans, it was problematic for the band. Among other things, Tim Smith&#x27;s guitar fell apart and keys fell off Sarah Smith&#x27;s saxophone.

After the Salisbury concert, Tim Quy left the band to pursue other projects. Like Sarah Smith, he was not replaced: the removal of live tuned and untuned percussion from the lineup further altered the established Cardiacs sound. Quy&#x27;s departure was commemorated by a message at the end of the &quot;Maresnest&quot; video stating &quot;this film is dedicated to Tim Quy who left our world 30/6/90&quot;. (At the time, this was widely misinterpreted as an announcement of Quy&#x27;s death). Quy remained on good terms with the band and would later appear as a special guest during Cardiacs&#x27; 2001 Astoria gig.

The band was quiet for the first four months of 1991, during which time two more members departed. William D. Drake played his final concert with the band on 2 May at The Venue in New Cross (going on to join the band Nervous and, in 2001, embarking on a long-delayed solo career). Having joined up-and-coming indie-psychedelic band Levitation, Christian Hayes played his own final gig as a Cardiac in Oxford on 16 May: although Cardiacs and Levitation were friendly with each other and had even toured together, Hayes had finally found it impossible to balance the demands of both bands. Both Hayes and Drake would continue to be associated with Cardiacs, and would occasionally guest with the band at selected live concerts many years later.

Between 1991 and 1993, Tim Smith, Christian Hayes, and Jon Poole (with drumming by David Francolini) performed live shows in a revitalized lineup of Hayes&#x27; 80&#x27;s band, Panixphere. The band performed Hayes&#x27; original material, the Tim Smith-penned &quot;More Money Than God&quot;, various covers including Cardiacs, XTC, Ring, and Foetus songs, and raw versions of Jon Poole-penned tracks that would later be recorded for &quot;Sing to God&quot;.

==== &quot;Heaven Born and Ever Bright&quot; and the Rough Trade debacle ====

Although the band had historically been well-used to lineup changes, Cardiacs were profoundly affected by the multiple departures taking place between 1989 and 1991. A particular blow had been the departure of Drake, whose virtuoso keyboard skills and compositional input had made him one of the backbones of the band. Drake was considered irreplaceable and Cardiacs opted not to look for a new keyboard player, remaining as a quartet of two guitars, bass and drums (with Christian Hayes being replaced as second guitarist by Jon Poole who had previously played with the Cardiacs-inspired Milton Keynes band Ad Nauseam). While Cardiacs were still able to record more fully orchestrated music in the studio, a lack of suitable personnel (or the budget to keep them in place) meant that the live band had to change drastically. Abandoning several signature musical features (saxophone, assorted percussion and virtuoso keyboards), Cardiacs&#x27; live music shifted away from the wider instrumentation of the past and moved towards a more guitar-heavy, power-rock sound in line with the remaining quartet lineup. However, the music remained complex, if narrower in focus, and Smith recorded additional keyboard and percussion parts onto backing tapes for the band to play over.

Before 1991 was over, the revitalised band had released a new single, called &quot;Day Is Gone&quot;, and played several concerts from October to December. This year also saw the release of &quot;Songs for Ships and Irons&quot;, which compiled material from the &quot;Big Ship&quot; mini-album plus various singles and EPs. Also making an appearance in 1991 was the debut release by the Cardiacs spin-off, the Sea Nymphs. Their debut single, &quot;Appealing to Venus&quot;, was a free bonus item with the first 500 copies of &quot;Day Is Gone&quot; and was subsequently sold through the fan club. The debut Sea Nymphs album, &quot;The Sea Nymphs&quot;, was released in 1992. Cardiacs remained active during 1992, touring frequently within the UK, including a double-headed tour with Levitation. On 4 June 1992 at the London Astoria, Cardiacs were supported by Radiohead.

Prior to the departure of Hayes, Cardiacs had recorded an album called &quot;Heaven Born and Ever Bright&quot; (which featured several of Hayes&#x27; guitar and vocal parts, plus a track he had co-written called &quot;Goodbye Grace&quot;). This was released as the new Cardiacs album in the summer of 1992, the first fruit of a new distribution deal with Rough Trade Records. However, Rough Trade ceased trading shortly after the release of the album. This ensured that &quot;Heaven Born and Ever Bright&quot; could neither be stocked nor ordered by record shops, with the result that Cardiacs were left thousands of pounds in debt and unable to recoup their recording expenses. (The album was eventually reissued on a revived Alphabet Business Concern in 1995 – it featured a picture of Jon Poole on the cover, although he had not actually played on the album when it was recorded.)

Despite this crippling blow, the band soldiered on, but by July 1993 yet another long-term member – drummer Dominic Luckman – had decided to quit. He played his last concert as a Cardiacs member on 20 July at Camden Palace, London (and would later join the Shrubbies). Luckman retained his connection with the band and would later make an appearance on stage during Cardiacs&#x27; 2001 Astoria show. In December 1993, Cardiacs revealed their new drummer, Jon Poole&#x27;s former Ad Nauseam bandmate, Bob Leith. However, the following year proved to be Cardiacs&#x27; quietest year for a long time, with only four concerts played in total.

==== &quot;Sing to God&quot; &amp; &quot;Guns&quot; ====

After three years without any new releases, 1995 saw the release of the &quot;Bellyeye&quot; single on Org Records (the record-releasing wing of long-term Cardiacs&#x27; supporters Organ Magazine). This was a taster for Cardiacs&#x27; most epic recorded effort to date. &quot;Sing to God&quot; was a double album, due to the sheer amount of material that Smith had written over a number of years. The album was notable for a change in Cardiacs&#x27; working methods – whereas most previous material had been written and arranged by Smith, the &quot;Sing to God&quot; sessions saw extensive contributions from Jon Poole who played a strong role in orchestrating Smith&#x27;s basic material with detailed riffs and keyboard parts (and contributed several songs entirely written by himself). Drummer Bob Leith also made significant contributions to the album&#x27;s lyrics.

&quot;Sing to God&quot; was released in two formats – as a limited edition double CD, and as two separate CDs. At the same time, the band reissued almost their entire back catalogue on CD. This constituted all of the albums from &quot;The Seaside&quot; onwards, CD issues of live album &quot;All that Glitters is a Mares Nest&quot; and the &quot;Archive Cardiacs&quot; compilation, and a new compilation, the &quot;Cardiacs Sampler&quot;.

In April 1995, Cardiacs performed a BBC Manchester radio session on Mark Radcliffe&#x27;s show. During May, they toured with Pura Vida and Sidi Bou Said and recorded a live acoustic session for GLR Radio. On 17 June, they appeared as special guests of (and concert openers for) Blur at their triumphant London Mile End Stadium concert. From 31 October to 18 November, Cardiacs performed a long support stint on Chumbawamba&#x27;s UK tour.

In June and November 1996, Cardiacs embarked on two UK tours of their own, most significantly filling the Astoria 2 on 2 November. The June tour was promoted by a second BBC Manchester radio session with Mark Radcliffe, aired on 11 June.

The next two years saw no new music from Cardiacs and reduced live activity. However, there were three more London concerts in 1998 – at one of these (the Garage concert on 4 December) the band was joined for an encore by William D. Drake. During the same year Cardiacs also played several performances in Germany and the Netherlands, and made appearances in Brighton and at a festival in St Austell in Cornwall. 1998 also saw renewed activity by the Sea Nymphs, with the &quot;Appealing To Venus&quot; single reissued with extra tracks by Org Records, and a rare concert at the Camden Falcon in north London.

At the start of 1999, Cardiacs played three nights in a row at the Camden Falcon, London between 29 and 31 January: on the final date, Sarah Smith and William D. Drake joined in for the encore. On 20 and 21 March the band played two concerts at the Garage with support from Dark Star (a new band featuring ex-Cardiac Christian Hayes) and Camp Blackfoot. Cardiacs toured the UK in June 1999 to support the release of their new album, &quot;Guns&quot;, described by some of the music press as being their most accessible album to date. The band performed another radio session on 13 June for &quot;Inside Tracks&quot; (on BBC Choice digital radio). Three more concerts followed in October.

=== 2000–2008: lineup changes and reestablishment ===

==== Rare sightings, family gatherings and aborted recordings ====
During 1999–2000, Cardiacs began work on a new studio album that remains incomplete and unreleased. Only one song slated for inclusion (&quot;Faster Than Snakes With a Ball and a Chain&quot;) has ever been released to the public (it appears on the band&#x27;s 2002 compilation &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;). Another song, the Jon Poole-penned &quot;Silvery&quot;, appeared regularly in the band&#x27;s live repertoire, and was later re-recorded by Jon Poole himself for the God Damn Whores&#x27; second album (albeit under the title &quot;Sparkly Silver Sky&quot;). While Tim Smith&#x27;s given explanation for the album&#x27;s nonappearance was that it had been rendered &quot;broken&quot; in some manner, bandmate Kavus Torabi has since stated that, while the band did record around this time, the concept of a &quot;lost album&quot; was apocryphal. Cardiacs concerts were rare over the next few years, although the band played the Glastonbury Festival on 23 June 2000 and played two subsequent Whitchurch Festivals on 5 August 2000 and 3 August 2001.

Counterbalancing the lack of tours, the band set up an annual tradition of one-off large-scale London concerts (the first of which took place on 11 November 2000 and the last in 2007). These usually took place in November at the London Astoria, and soon became a kind of Cardiacs family gathering in which the band was joined by various guests including former members and newer Cardiacs-inspired supported bands. During these concerts, Sarah Smith, William D. Drake, Christian Hayes and Dominic Luckman all appeared onstage with the band on various occasions, as did the Consultant and Miss Swift. Support bands were always musicians with a professed Cardiacs connection or influence, and included Oceansize, the Monsoon Bassoon, the Scaramanga Six, Stars in Battledress and Jon Poole&#x27;s hard-rock band God Damn Whores.

==== &quot;The Special Garage Concerts&quot; ====
Between 17–19 October 2003, Cardiacs recorded three special concerts at the Highbury Garage venue in London. As Jon Poole was by now also the bass player for the Wildhearts (and busy rehearsing for the upcoming Wildhearts tour) he was replaced for the concert by Kavus Torabi (formerly guitarist and singer for the Monsoon Bassoon, Torabi was also a long-standing Cardiacs associate who&#x27;d served as their guitar technician since the mid-1990s.)

For these concerts, the band delved back into their distant past, abandoning virtually all of their available back catalogue in favour of exclusively playing songs that had been performed prior to 1983. These were taken mostly from the cassette albums (&quot;The Obvious Identity&quot; and &quot;Toy World&quot;, but also included songs such as &quot;An Ant&quot;, &quot;Hopeless&quot;, &quot;Gloomy News&quot; and &quot;Hello Mr Minnow&quot; (which had never been officially recorded before and had only ever been played at concerts in the late &#x27;70s/early &#x27;80s). A two-volume CD set of recordings from the three shows – &quot;The Special Garage Concerts&quot; – was eventually released in 2005. Professional video camera equipment was apparently seen being used to record the band during the concerts, leading to a rumour that members of Org Records had filmed the entire three nights for later video release. This was debunked by Torabi in a 2009 interview, in which he stated that no such recordings existed. However, a static cam recording of one night was released by The Consultant.

==== Final expanded line-ups - &quot;Ditzy Scene&quot; and &quot;LSD&quot; ====

In the autumn of 2004, Torabi officially replaced Poole as Cardiacs&#x27; second guitarist, and made his formal debut as a full group member at the annual London Astoria concert on 12 November (Poole would go on to concentrate on God Damn Whores, various Wildhearts-related projects, Crayola Lectern and others). This lineup performed classic songs on Radio2XS in December 2004 as part of the station&#x27;s &quot;Barn Sessions&quot;. A number of other new members were drafted into the Cardiacs lineup around the same time – three backing singers (Claire Lemmon and Melanie Woods of Sidi Bou Said, plus former Shrubbies and current North Sea Radio Orchestra singer Sharron Fortnam) and two percussionists – Cathy Harabaras and Dawn Staple – playing mostly bass drums.

After several years of limited live activity in front of established fans, Cardiacs made another attempt to recapture their momentum and play to fresh audiences by supporting long-terms fans the Wildhearts for the latter&#x27;s tour between 8–15 December 2004. This tour saw another substitution – drummer Stephen Gilchrist (Graham Coxon, the Scaramanga Six, Stuffy/The Fuses) stood in for Bob Leith, who had previous tour commitments with art-punk band Blurt. Smith would later perform as a live acoustic trio with Ginger Wildheart and former Cardiac Jon Poole. Around this time a &quot;Diary&quot; was begun and updated for the majority of 2005 on the official Cardiacs website, chronicling the band&#x27;s exploits in typical absurd fashion. Three more annual Astoria gigs were performed over the following three years (the 2005 edition having been professionally shot but left in an unedited state awaiting Tim Smith&#x27;s involvement).

Cardiacs performed live radio sessions hosted by Marc Riley in October 2005 and June 2007.

On 5 November 2007, Cardiacs released their first new material for eight years. The &quot;Ditzy Scene&quot; single was released on Org Records as a limited edition of 1,000 copies, and featured the new line-up, albeit minus Sharron Fortnam. Heavily pre-ordered, the single featured two other new tracks &quot;Gen&quot; and &quot;Made All Up&quot;, which teased Cardiacs&#x27; next planned project, a full album called &quot;LSD&quot; (intended as a double set, their second following &quot;Sing to God&quot;). On the release, Cardiacs biographer Adrian Bell comments &quot;It&#x27;s only when you become aware how insular the Alphabet Business Concern is that you realise the high regard they must have for &quot;The Organ&quot;&quot;. The song charted at number 72 on the Spanish iTunes Chart on 11 October 2020.

Claire Lemmon and Dawn Staple had also left the active lineup by the time of the 2007 winter tour, on which Melanie Woods and Cathy Harabaras both doubled on percussion and singing. On the tour, Torabi recalled that &quot;the crowds were getting bigger and younger and something was definitely happening&quot;, adding that Tim&#x27;s brother and bass player Jim Smith said &quot;something was in the air, that this might be our time.&quot; Cardiacs toured until the winter of 2007.

In 2008, Tim Smith played snippets of two untitled &quot;LSD&quot; songs during an interview on Resonance FM.

On 23 June 2008, the band performed three songs, including the unreleased live favorite &quot;Silvery&quot;, live on Marc Riley&#x27;s Brain Surgery. During an interview segment, Tim Smith revealed the band&#x27;s plans for the rest of the year: a DVD release of All That Glitters is a Mares Nest, the release of &quot;LSD&quot; and two accompanying singles, another Marc Riley session and a fall tour supporting the new album.

=== 2008–2020: illness of Tim Smith and hiatus ===

==== Tim Smith&#x27;s heart attack ====
At the end of June 2008, Tim Smith collapsed from a cardiac arrest after leaving a My Bloody Valentine concert. This led to hypoxic brain damage, leaving Smith severely debilitated by the rare condition dystonia. All Cardiacs-related releases and activity (including the work-in-progress for the unfinished &quot;LSD&quot;) were immediately shelved until further notice. A year of silence followed during which Smith recuperated in private. In June 2009, a new announcement appeared on the official Cardiacs website, letting readers know that, after a year of rehabilitation, Tim Smith&#x27;s mind had returned to full functionality and that &quot;no part of your favourite pop star&#x27;s intellect or personality has been found to be absent whatsoever.&quot; It thanked fans for their kind thoughts and made clear Smith&#x27;s interest in returning to playing music with Cardiacs at such time as his physical rehabilitation allowed. However, it became clear that such rehabilitation would be a long process; and in August 2010, Kavus Torabi stated in an interview podcast that Cardiacs would never play live again.

==== Hiatus, fundraisers and related activities ====
Despite the enforced halt in Cardiacs&#x27; work as an active band, the group&#x27;s influence and presence has been sustained by various concerts and campaigns. While most of these have been primarily aimed at raising money for Tim Smith&#x27;s medical rehabilitation, they have also served both to raise awareness of the band&#x27;s work and the growing body of musicians influenced by it.

In December 2010, two tribute CDs, &quot;Leader of the Starry Skies: A Tribute To Tim Smith, Songbook 1&quot; and its limited edition companion &quot;Leader of the Starry Skies - A Loyal Companion&quot;, were compiled by former Cardiac Christian Hayes and former Spratleys Japs singer Jo Spratley. These were released on Kavus Torabi&#x27;s record label Believers Roast, with all proceeds going directly to the continuing care of Tim Smith. The albums featured cover versions of Smith-penned material (originally for Cardiacs, the Sea Nymphs, Spratleys Japs and Smith&#x27;s solo album OceanLandWorld) by musicians including the Magic Numbers, Steven Wilson, Oceansize, Robert White/Andy Partridge, Sidi Bou Said and North Sea Radio Orchestra as well as former Cardiacs including Hayes himself (as Mikrokosmos), Torabi (as Knifeworld), William D. Drake, Mark Cawthra and Peter Tagg (with the Trudy).

In 2013, after a long period of radio silence, the official Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale, including a DVD release of All That Glitters is a Mares Nest. Among other updates, an amendment to the &#x27;History&#x27; section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith&#x27;s accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band&#x27;s hiatus.

In the coming years, various Cardiacs releases would and continue to be added to the online shop, most notably a 2015 &quot;The Seaside&quot; boxset containing the original album remastered and with the original four &quot;missing&quot; tracks restored, as well as various supplementary material related to the era.

In 2013 and 2015 events dubbed &quot;The Alphabet Business Convention&quot; were held in celebration of and with all proceeds going towards Tim Smith&#x27;s rehabilitation. They featured Cardiacs-related groups in performance such as Knifeworld, William D. Drake, and Redbus Noface, and were attended by Smith himself. Several smaller benefit concerts were held from time to time in this period and moving forward.

In a 2016 feature via &quot;The Quietus&quot;, Kavus Torabi shed light on several past, present, and future Cardiacs projects. It was an extraordinarily interesting and brilliant time for me because we&#x27;d already talked a great deal about what the plan was for the next few years for Cardiacs. We were going to make a film. Tim and I were planning out loads of treatments and scripts. Tim wanted to share the burden of Cardiacs a bit with someone and I was more than happy to do that. The way things stand, [LSD] is nearly done but needs vocals and eyebrows and some of them need a few other touches. What there is does sound great but there&#x27;s far more stuff completed that hasn&#x27;t come out yet, that needs to come out. Tim is a perfectionist, and rightly so. Because his melodies make so much sense of everything, it would be ridiculous to put out these recordings, as exciting as they are, without the melodies. We have talked about people who Tim would approve of adding vocals, under his direction. I think Tim just wants to be well enough to really be producing it. I think his big drive at the moment is to finish off things that were started. There are a lot of loose ends that need tying up. 

Later the same year, teaser images began appearing on Cardiacs&#x27; website and Facebook group, culminating in the announcement of the long-awaited next Sea Nymphs album, &quot;On the Dry Land&quot;, whose songs had been recorded around the same time as the first album but were left unreleased for over 20 years. The album was released in November 2016 in CD and vinyl formats. The completion of on the Dry Land was made possible thanks to a turn for the better in Tim Smith&#x27;s health; he was able to return to the studio to supervise production and additional recording necessary to the album&#x27;s completion between 2015-2016. In an interview with Uncut, Smith said that even more Sea Nymphs material will be released at some point. He also stated that he was &quot;deeply touched&quot; by the efforts of those who had contributed toward the Cardiacs tribute album, Leader of the Starry Skies (the sales of which went directly toward rehabilitating Smith) and that he had since &quot;made a pledge to [him]self to get better&quot;.

In November 2016, Jo Spratley gathered several musicians of Cardiacs-influenced origins and &quot;reformed&quot; her and Tim Smith&#x27;s band, Spratleys Japs (albeit without Smith due to his health, although he did attend as an audience member), for a one night show in which the band performed the entirety of the Japs&#x27; sole album, &quot;Pony&quot; (1999), as well as the remaining tracks from the &quot;Hazel&quot; EP (and ended the set with Cardiacs&#x27; own &quot;Flap Off You Beak&quot;). A second show was announced shortly afterward for January 2017, as a double billing with Kavus Torabi&#x27;s band Guapo.

In December 2016 Tim, Sarah, and William D. Drake were interviewed for Prog magazine, detailing more of Tim&#x27;s current condition, the sessions behind &quot;On the Dry Land&quot;&#x27;s creation and completion and confirming &quot;at least an album&#x27;s worth&quot; of Sea Nymphs material that is yet to be finished.

A third Alphabet Business Convention was held on 26 August 2017, featuring Cardiacs-related and inspired bands, with Tim Smith in attendance, in the spirit of the preceding conventions.

In September 2017, the Alphabet Business Concern released the long-awaited &quot;Some Fairytales from the Rotten Shed DVD&quot; which featured Cardiacs rehearsing early songs (mixed with surrealist comedy similar to the &quot;Maresnest&quot; DVD) in preparation for &quot;The Special Garage Concerts&quot;-era live shows. (Prior to this, only four clips had been available to the public via the &quot;abcglobus&quot; YouTube channel, with a nearly-complete version of the DVD having been screened at the 2013 Alphabet Business Convention. During this time, the unreleased film was commonly referred to as &quot;The Bumming Shed video&quot; or &quot;The Garage Rehearsals video&quot;.)

In January 2018, almost ten years since Tim Smith&#x27;s cardiac arrest, an interview and full explanation of his condition were published in multiple major news publications as well as the official Cardiacs website. A donation campaign was simultaneously launched, its goal being to facilitate improved care for Smith with the hope that the proper neurological treatment it would fund would help him regain control of his body, as he had responded positively to similar, but minimal and inconsistent treatment in the past. The initial donation goal of 40,000 GBP was breached in less than 24 hours, and a new goal of 100,000 GBP was instated, which would fund treatment for one year.

In March 2018, almost all of the Cardiacs back catalogue (including all of the post-1990 singles and EPs, plus the OceanLandWorld, Spratleys Japs, Sea Nymphs and Mr &amp; Mrs Smith &amp; Mr Drake spinoff projects) was reissued on Bandcamp as digital downloads.

On 25 October 2018, Tim Smith was awarded an honorary music doctorate by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Jim Smith accepted the award on his brother&#x27;s behalf.

Further fundraising events were held in 2018 and 2019, featuring live music from Cardiacs members and related bands, film screenings and interviews, with Tim Smith sporadically in attendance.

With the advent of social media, it has been noted that Cardiacs had perhaps become a more popular band during their inactivity than ever before. Facebook group membership numbers swelled sharply during this period, and video essays on the band now garner hundreds of thousands of views.

=== 2020–2023: Death of Tim Smith, Tim Quy, and other activities ===
Following twelve years of living with dystonia, Smith died on 21 July 2020, with his death announced on Cardiacs website and other news publications the following day by his brother and original band member Jim Smith. A tribute post was made on the official site several days later by Cardiacs&#x27; &quot;ordinary shop girl&quot; and website maintainer, Mary. Following his death, Tim Smith received a raft of tributes on social media.

An unreleased Tim Smith Cardiacs song (who had performed it solo in occasional live performances) &quot;Vermin Mangle&quot; was shared publicly on 30 July 2020 during Steve Davis&#x27; Tim Smith tribute show on Phoenix FM. The song was officially released on 1 September 2020 to mark Smith&#x27;s funeral which was held the same day. It was released by the band&#x27;s record label, the Alphabet Business Concern, as a free download through their Bandcamp page at midnight, intended as a thank you to the group&#x27;s fans. It was their first single and release of new material since &quot;Ditzy Scene&quot; in 2007, and was intended as the closing track for &quot;LSD&quot;.

A video recording of 2005&#x27;s &quot;Secret Bull &amp; Gate Concerts&quot; was broadcast on Cardiacs&#x27; YouTube channel December 2020. Percussionist Tim Quy died on 2 February 2023, aged 61, having been through long and difficult illnesses. Jim announced his passing on the Cardiacs website. In 2023, a 35th anniversary remastered and expanded boxset release of &quot;A Little Man and a House and the Whole World Window&quot;, overseen by Tim Smith in 2020 as his final task, was released in dedication to Smith and Quy, and quickly sold out.

=== 2024–: A Return to Live Shows (Sing to Tim) ===

==== Sing to Tim: First Shows (3–5 May 2024) ====

Over 3 years after Tim&#x27;s passing, and having teased at something involving the band in the days preceding, Tim Smith&#x27;s Spratleys announced a show, featuring Cardiacs members &quot;past, present, and future&quot; to pay tribute to Tim Smith and his music, which was to take place at the Garage on 4 May 2024 (subsequently adding dates 3 May at the Garage and 5 May at Brudenell Social Club). On 3 May, Cardiacs consisted of Jim Smith (bass and backup vocals), Jon Poole (vocals and guitar), Christian Hayes (vocals and guitar), and Bob Leith (drums), with new members, long-time associates Craig Fortnam (percussion), Chloe Herington (saxophone), and Adrien Rodes (keyboard). Sharron Fortnam (vocals), Jo Spratley (vocals), Tiny Wood from Sleepy People (vocals), Kavus Torabi (guitar, and who was slated to be a main member before schedule conflicts) and Mark Cawthra (vocals) appeared on stage as guests.

==== Sing to Tim: Autumn Tour (10–13 October 2024) ====
Following the May shows in London and Leeds, on 7 May 2024 it was announced that Sing to Tim would be coming back for another 4 shows in early October. These shows were marketed as an &quot;Autumn tour&quot; and the announcement was posted, like the last, on the Tim Smith&#x27;s Spratleys Facebook page. The four dates were to take place between 10–13 October and will take place in the cities of Manchester (Band on the Wall), Glasgow (SWG3 Warehouse), Newcastle (The Grove) and Brighton (Concorde 2).

==== Other activities ====

On 17 June 2024, Cardiacs, along with Tim Smith&#x27;s Spratleys, played a double-header radio session as part of the BBC Radio 6 Music Riley &amp; Coe block, nearly 16 years after their last public radio appearance (also hosted by Marc Riley). During their Riley &amp; Coe interviews, Jo Spratley and Jim Smith explained that attempts had been made to resume live activity in 2020 and 2021, but were aborted for various reasons. With the passage of time, all involved believed it was now the right time to continue. During Cardiacs&#x27; interview, Jim Smith confirmed that the long-unreleased album &quot;LSD&quot; was in the mixing stage, and that he had hoped to release it around April 2025. He also elaborated that the album had been worked on before and during Tim&#x27;s illness and after his passing, with contributions from many Cardiacs family members and friends.

== Musical and lyrical style ==

Cardiacs have been labeled as art rock, psychedelic rock, avant-punk, post-punk, art-pop, art-punk, experimental rock and indie rock. Cardiacs&#x27; music is noted for balancing the attack and &#x27;raw energy&#x27; of punk rock with the intricacies and technical cleverness of early British progressive rock. The band also incorporates elements of other musical forms such as ska, medieval music, folk music, heavy metal, hymns, classical and corporate anthems. The music magazine Organ once commented that &quot;one Cardiacs song contains more ideas than most other musicians&#x27; entire careers.&quot;

The broad combination of styles in the band&#x27;s music has sometimes been referred to as &quot;progressive punk&quot; – or &quot;pronk&quot; – and has led to Cardiacs being labelled the primary exponents of this musical style. Tim Smith rejected the term, preferring the description &quot;psychedelic&quot; or simply &quot;pop&quot;. Musicians that the band have cited as influences include XTC, Van der Graaf Generator, Gong, early Split Enz, Devo, Gentle Giant (though downplayed by Smith), Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias, early Genesis, Deaf School, Wire. The Who&#x27;s &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; was particularly influential on Smith&#x27;s approach to songwriting, having taught how to write musical notation from the album&#x27;s songbook.

&quot;I don’t know what influences [Cardiacs] really, I wouldn’t say that we are influenced by any actual bands in particular, I’ve got no bones about musically ripping someone else’s band off though…. I’ve definitely nicked bits and pieces here and there, I don’t mind if they don’t mind…. I remember working on one song we did a little while ago which was based just on the memory of a song I heard by someone else way back when I was about 14 years old, trouble was that it ended up quite similar to the original, I didn’t care, but the audacity of it raised a few wiggly eyebrows, the actual tune I wrote was totally different and all that… but the atmosphere was very similar, which pleased me as it was that which I was trying to rekindle…. I thought my memory of it had twisted the atmosphere into this new creature, but as it turned out my memory wasn’t that bad… but so what, tunes are for borrowing, you give them all back in the end. *

‘Influences’ come more from random or abstract things… like I might walk past a radio playing something nice in somebodies window…. or I’ll hear a ghost in the bushes, or whatever, and I’ll think ‘oooh I’ll do a song like that’ but it’ll twist into something totally different in the end….but I do like DEVO and I think Jim Feotus [sic] and Zappa are genius and Gentle Giant have there moments of total unique brilliance (and moments of embarrassing grimness as well, like anyone unfortunately) but I can’t say that they influence us any more than a crow on a stump does.&quot;

-Margen Magazine (Spain) April 2001, Tim Smith Interview

Earlier lineups of the band were sextets and octets employing extensive use of saxophones, percussion and live keyboards. From 1991 onwards, the band was a rock power quartet centred on two guitars (with the remaining keyboard and percussion parts sequenced on tape). Vocally, Cardiacs employed a distinctive singing style centred on Tim Smith&#x27;s lead vocals (reedy and high-pitched, with a strong, punk-styled south London suburban accent) and choral sections (varying from yelled to falsetto) involving most or all of the band. Smith&#x27;s singing style has been described by music critics as &#x27;skittish&#x27;; it has also been commented that his singing voice sounded very similar to his speaking one. The band&#x27;s music was written almost entirely by Tim Smith, although contributions were sometimes made by other group members.

Smith was also responsible for the majority of the band&#x27;s lyrics, which were written in a cryptic fractured form of English alternately hailed as poetic or nonsensical. He generally refused to discuss their content, preferring to keep the words and their inspirations shrouded in mystique and allowing for fan interpretations. Smith also sometimes employed a cut-up lyrical approach drawing on the works of (among others), William Blake, Charles Kingsley, William Shakespeare and T.S. Eliot. Two favourite cut-and-paste sources were Pedro Carolino&#x27;s &quot;English As She Is Spoke&quot; (a failed Victorian English-Portuguese phrasebook once hailed by Mark Twain as a perfect example of absurdity) and the nineteenth-century Irish poet George Darley. Fans have also spotted references to the films &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; and &quot;Eraserhead&quot; in Smith&#x27;s words and music videos. Jim Smith recalls the film &quot;Overlord&quot; as another influence on his brother.

== Performance style and mythology ==

Alphabet&#x27;s original representative characters were Cardiac&#x27;s &quot;sordid, waxy&quot; manager &quot;the Consultant&quot; (real name James Stevens) and his assistant and band advisor &quot;Miss Swift&quot;, both of whom made onstage appearances with Cardiacs during the 1980s.

In performance, Cardiacs generally rejected (or occasionally parodied) standard rock band posturing. The band&#x27;s shows instead featured behaviour which has been described as &quot;therapeutic, surrealist pantomime&quot;, compared to absurdist theatre, and labelled &quot;not so much theatrically eccentric as completely fucking neurotic&quot;. During any given performance Tim Smith ranted between and during numbers, acting out bizarre childlike ideas and emotions. During the 1980s the band perfected a detailed stage act involving shabby lift attendant costumes, badly-applied clown makeup, Tim Smith&#x27;s bullying and confrontation of other band members (predominantly Jim Smith), and a final formal presentation of champagne and flowers by the Consultant and Miss Swift complete with confetti, taking place to &quot;a euphoric sweep of saxophone and keyboards that wouldn&#x27;t seem out of place in a &#x27;70s cigar advert.&quot; During the 1990s, the theatrical elements of the live show were toned down and the uniforms replaced by formal suits, although certain rituals (including the childlike mannerisms and Smith&#x27;s ranting style) were retained.

== Legacy ==
While the critical status of Cardiacs is wildly mixed (the band tends to attract extreme responses, with some critics hailing them while others violently condemn them to the point of pariahhood), Cardiacs were renowned for their unique performing and songwriting styles and their poetically cryptic, philosophical and abstract lyrics, as well as for their ability to produce a unique, complex and innovative sound with all their musical ventures over and over again throughout their long career. Tim Smith regularly attracted fulsome praise: he has been described in the music press as the &quot;Mozart&quot;, &quot;Beethoven&quot; and &quot;Messiaen&quot; of rock and pop music for his complex and innovative compositional skills, as well as being hailed as a genius (albeit sometimes a &quot;deranged&quot; one). The snooker player Steve Davis is also a big fan of the band and attended many of their live gigs, as well as co-authoring the book &quot;Medical Grade Music&quot;, featuring Cardiacs, with Torabi.

Cardiacs have had a profound underground influence on over three decades of musicians, including the pioneers of the nu metal and avant-garde metal genres. The band has also influenced math rock artists such as the Monsoon Bassoon and Battles. The band are sometimes credited as having been the inventors of the &quot;pronk&quot; (progressive punk) music genre; Tim Smith rejected the term from the off, stating that Cardiacs are better described as a pop group or a psychedelic rock band.

Groups who have cited Tim Smith&#x27;s work as a major influence include Blur, Mike Vennart of Oceansize, Mike Patton of Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, and Tool. During the 1980s, Cardiacs were a professed influence or inspiration for Marillion, It Bites and British psychedelic acts such as Ring; during the 1990s, emerging bands and musicians who were or became Cardiacs fans included Blur, Supergrass, Shane Embury of Napalm Death, Storm Corrosion&#x27;s Steven Wilson and Mikael Åkerfeldt, Neil Cicierega, the Scaramanga Six, the Monsoon Bassoon, Leech Woman, Mike Keneally, Justin Hawkins of The Darkness, Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters, and the Wildhearts (who would later pay direct tribute via their track &quot;Tim Smith&quot; on 2009&#x27;s &quot;Chutzpah!&quot; and 2021&#x27;s &quot;We Sing for Tim&quot;). During the 2000s, Cardiacs influenced musical acts such as Rocketgoldstar, Little Trophy, the Display Team, Liberty Ships, Major Parkinson and Silvery. During the 2010s, Cardiacs-inspired musical acts like Black Midi, Everything Everything, and Bent Knee entered the scene. Visual artists Cyriak and Jim Woodring have also professed an affinity for Cardiacs and Tim Smith.

Six months after Tim Smith&#x27;s death, Cardiacs&#x27; discography was added to streaming services on 22 January 2021.

In 2024, Cardiacs members past, present &quot;and future&quot; reformed to play sold-out shows across the UK.

In January 2025, the band released a visual history coffee table book, &quot;Cardiacs: A Big Book and a Band and the Whole World Window&quot;, with author Aaron Tanner.

<text>::For the &quot;Va&#x27;adat Ezrah Vehatzalah&quot;, known as the &quot;Vaad&quot;, see Aid and Rescue Committee

Vaad () is a Hebrew term for a council. Often it refers to a council of rabbis, i.e., a rabbinical council. It is a diasporic phenomenon, having no precedent in Talmudic times. A Vaad has different responsibilities from a &quot;beth din&quot; (rabbinical court).

==Historical==
Older examples include the Council of Four Lands. 
Since the Enlightenment and the subsequent emancipation of Jews living in European nations, Jewish communities no longer have their own autonomous governments, and vaads with governmental powers no longer exist. Nevertheless, Vaads empowered by the Rabbinate and community leaders continued to wield tremendous power within their respective Jewish communities. A prime example of this was the Vaad Rosh Hashochtim of Poland and Lithuania, a council that consisted of seven Rabbis that regulated the over 3,500 practicing in Poland and Lithuania prior to the Holocaust.

Today, Vaads still exist as rabbinical councils, each with its own purview. Some deal with maintaining communal standards of kashrut (kosher food); others deal with communal standards of marriage, divorce and conversion to Judaism.

==Modern day==
Modern-day vaads in &quot;Orthodox Judaism&quot; include the Vaad Halakha and the Beth Din of America, both sponsored by the Rabbinical Council of America. Another example is the Vaad Harabonim, part of the Rabbinical Council of New England. It supervises the kashrut of foods for many food manufacturers in New England, USA.

Modern-day vaads in &quot;Conservative Judaism&quot; include the Rabbinical Assembly&#x27;s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, and the Israeli &quot;Vaad Halakha&quot;.

The term is also used at Jewish summer camps, such as Camp Ramah Darom and Camp Ramah in the Berkshires, to refer to a group of counselors who work together to plan a program for their campers. Examples include a Vaad Tefillah (which plans programs during morning prayer services), a Vaad Peulat Erev (which plans evening activities), and a Vaad Shabbat (which plans programs for the sabbath). Because of its frequent use at camps, many Jewish young adults have adopted this term for use in other contexts. For example, when planning a party, one may be a member of Vaad Tequila.

<text>The Warm Springs Indian Reservation consists of in north-central Oregon, in the United States, and is governed by the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs.

==Tribes==

Three tribes form the confederation: the Wasco, Tenino (Warm Springs) and Paiute. Since 1938 they have been unified as the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs.

==History ==
The reservation was created by treaty in 1855, which defined its boundaries as follows:
Commencing in the middle of the channel of the Deschutes River opposite the eastern termination of a range of high lands usually known as the Mutton Mountains; thence westerly to the summit of said range, along the divide to its connection with the Cascade Mountains; thence to the summit of said mountains; thence southerly to Mount Jefferson; thence down the main branch of Deschutes River; heading in this peak, to its junction with Deschutes River; and thence down the middle of the channel of said river to the place of beginning.

The Warm Springs and Wasco bands gave up ownership rights to a area, which they had inhabited for over 10,000 years, in exchange for basic health care, education, and other forms of assistance as outlined by the Treaty with the Tribes of Middle Oregon (June 25, 1855). Other provisions of the Treaty of 1855 ensured that tribal members retained hunting and fishing rights in the &quot;Natural and Accustomed Area&quot; which they had vacated. These treaty hunting and fishing rights are rights that were retained by the tribe and are not &quot;special rights&quot; granted by the U.S. government.

In 1879, the U.S. government moved about 38 Paiutes to the reservation and around 70 more in 1884, despite that tribe&#x27;s history of conflict with Columbia River tribes.

The borders of the reservation were under dispute for 101 years, during what became known as the McQuinn Strip boundary dispute. In 1871, a surveyor named T.B. Handley measured the land, determining that it was smaller than outlined in the treaty of 1855. The Warms Spring people objected and, in 1887, a surveyor named John A. McQuinn determined that they were correct; Handley had incorrectly measured the reservation&#x27;s boundaries. By this time, settlers had moved onto the disputed land. The government offered the Warm Springs people a cash settlement for the land, but the Warms Springs people refused it. In 1972, Public Law 92-427 restored the land to the Warm Springs people.

==Geography==

The reservation lies primarily in parts of Wasco County and Jefferson County, but there are smaller sections in six other counties; in descending order of land area they are: Clackamas, Marion, Gilliam, Sherman, Linn and Hood River counties. (The Hood River County portion consists of tiny sections of non-contiguous off-reservation trust land in the northeast corner of the county.) The reservation is southeast of Portland; , over half, is forested.

== Government ==
The government of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation is handled by the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. There is a tribal police department.

==Demographics ==
Its 2000 census total population was 3,314 inhabitants.

The reservations&#x27;s only significant population center is the community of Warm Springs (also known as the Warm Springs Agency), which comprises over 73 percent of the reservation&#x27;s population. As of 2003, the reservation was home to a tribal enrollment of over 4,200.

==Culture==
The Warm Springs Reservation is one of the last holdouts in the U.S. of speakers of the Chinook Jargon because of its utility as an intertribal language. The forms of the Jargon used by elders in Warm Springs vary considerably from the heavily creolized form at Grand Ronde.

Kiksht, Numu and Ichishkiin Snwit languages are taught in the Warm Springs Reservation schools.

The Museum at Warm Springs houses a large collection of North American Indian artifacts. It was opened in 1993.

==Economy==
The biggest source of revenue for the tribes is hydroelectric (Warm Springs Power Enterprises) projects on the Deschutes River. The tribes also operate Warm Springs Forest Products Industries.

Many tribal members engage in ceremonial, subsistence, and commercial fisheries in the Columbia River for salmon, steelhead, and sturgeon. The Columbia Basin Initiative aims to improve salmon-fishing for the tribe. Tribal members also fish for salmon and steelhead for subsistence purposes in the Deschutes River, primarily at Sherars Falls. Tribal members also harvest Pacific lamprey at Sherars Falls and Willamette Falls. The tribe&#x27;s fishing rights are protected by treaty and re-affirmed by court cases such as Sohappy v. Smith and United States v. Oregon.

===Tourism===
In 1964, the first part of the Kah-nee-ta resort was completed – Kah-nee-ta Village – a lodging complex with a motel, cottages, and tipis. The resort eventually included a lodge, casino, convention center, and golf course. Due to lack of rentability, the resort was closed in September 2018.
The Indian Head Casino on U.S. Route 26 opened in February 2012. It has of gaming space, with 500 slot machines and 8 blackjack tables. The tribes expect the casino to net $9 to 12 million annually. The casino previously operated at Kah-Nee-Ta, where it had only 300 slot machines and made $2 to 4 million a year. The new location was intended to be more accessible to travelers, since Kah-Nee-Ta is located about a half an hour from Highway 26.

In 2016, the tribe&#x27;s lumber mill, also located on Highway 26 near the village of Warm Springs, shut down. It had been operating for decades but output had declined in recent years. One solution proposed by a tribal entity, Warm Springs Ventures, to create new revenue and jobs for the tribe was the launch of three new business ventures: cannabis cultivation, extraction and distribution; drone training, certification and manufacture; and a carbon offset venture that would sell carbon offsets to major polluters. All three ventures were expected to be operating sometime in 2017. The tribe was awarded the right by the Federal Aviation Administration to certify drone operators in 2016. The cannabis project was approved by a vote of tribal members but as of October 2016 still faced administrative and funding challenges.

==Ecology==
Biologists of the Confederated Tribe of the Warm Springs have assisted the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in tracking the repopulation of wolves in Oregon. Wolves are dispersing into territory where they haven&#x27;t lived for decades including the northern Cascades region. The biologists fitted OR-93 with a purple radio collar in June 2020. The two-year-old male wolf had left his White River pack and became the 16th documented gray wolf in the repopulation of wolves in California when he reached Mono County, east of Yosemite National Park in the central Sierra Nevada in February 2021 Two adult wolves were found on the reservation in December 2021 by the biologists and two pups were caught on a trail camera in August 2022. These resident wolves brought the total number of known wolf groups in the region to three.

==Infrastructure==
Water from the Deschutes River goes through a treatment facility and serves around 3,800 people.

<doc id="393090" wikidata="Q12642162" url="?curid=393090" title="Northern Paiute people">
<text>The Northern Paiute people are a Numic people who have traditionally lived in the Great Basin region of the United States in what is now eastern California, western Nevada, and southeast Oregon. The Northern Paiute pre-contact lifestyle was well adapted to the harsh desert environment in which they lived. Each tribe or band occupied a specific territory, generally centered on a lake or wetland that supplied fish and waterfowl. Communal hunt drives, which often involved neighboring bands, would take rabbits and pronghorn from surrounding areas. Individuals and families appear to have moved freely among the bands.

Northern Paiute originally lived a seminomadic lifestyle, moving from place to place following animal migration patterns and seasonal foods. They lived in small, independent groups that consisted of a handful or so of different family units. Upon arrival of foreigners into western Nevada, the Northern Paiute became sedentary in order to protect themselves and handle negotiations with the new settlers. Because of their change from a nomadic to a sedentary lifestyle, women were relied upon more heavily for both their full-time employment and at-home work. In some modern Northern Paiute tribes, men work in &quot;seasonal jobs on the ranches, in the mines, and as caretakers in the nearby motels&quot; and women work &quot;in the laundry, the bakery, in homes and motels as domestics, and in the country hospital&quot;.

They gathered Pinyon nuts in the mountains in the fall as a critical winter food source. Women also gathered grass seeds and roots as important parts of their diet. The name of each band was derived from a characteristic food source. For example, the people at Pyramid Lake were known as the &quot;Cui Ui Ticutta&quot; (meaning &quot;Cui-ui eaters&quot;, or trout eaters). The people of the Lovelock area were known as the &quot;Koop Ticutta&quot;, meaning &quot;ground-squirrel eaters&quot; and the people of the Carson Sink were known as the &quot;Toi Ticutta&quot; meaning &quot;tule eaters&quot;. The &quot;Kucadikadi&quot; of Mono County, California are the &quot;brine fly eaters&quot;.

==Relations with other tribes and European settlers==
Relations among the Northern Paiute and their Shoshone neighbors were generally peaceful. There is no sharp distinction between the Northern Paiute and Western Shoshone or &quot;Sosone&quot;. Relations with the &quot;Waasseoo&quot; or Washoe people, who were culturally and linguistically very different, were not so peaceful. These differences in lifestyle and language could be because Northern Paiute may have moved from southern regions to the Nevada/California area in which they currently reside. They also may have overthrown and destroyed other Indian tribes in order to inhabit their current lands. For example, the Paiute were almost &quot;continually at war&quot; with the Klamath south and west of them. &quot;The Achomawi, south of the Klamath, also were enemies of the Northern Paiute, (so much so that) the earliest wars related in Achomawi oral tradition were (with) Northern Paiute&quot;.

Sustained contact between the Northern Paiute and European Americans began in the early 1840s, although the first contact may have occurred as early as the 1820s. Although the Paiute had adopted the use of horses from other Great Plains tribes, their culture was otherwise then largely unaffected by European influences. As Euro-American settlement of the area progressed, competition for scarce resources increased. Several violent confrontations took place, including the Pyramid Lake War of 1860, Owens Valley Indian War 1861–1864, Snake War 1864–1868; and the Bannock War of 1878. These incidents generally began with a disagreement between settlers and the Paiute (singly or in a group) regarding property, retaliation by one group against the other, and finally counter-retaliation by the opposite party, frequently culminating in the armed involvement of the U.S. Army. Fatalities were much higher among the Paiute due to newly introduced Eurasian infectious diseases, such as smallpox, which were endemic among the Europeans. The Natives had no acquired immunity. Sarah Winnemucca&#x27;s book &quot;Life Among the Piutes&quot; (1883) gives a first-hand account of this period.

The US government first established the Malheur Reservation for the Northern Paiute in eastern Oregon. It intended to concentrate the Northern Paiute there, but its strategy did not work. Because of the distance of the reservation from the traditional areas of most of the bands, and because of its poor environmental conditions, many Northern Paiute refused to go there. Those that did, soon left. They clung to their traditional lifestyle as long as possible. When environmental degradation of their lands made that impossible, they sought jobs on white farms, ranches or in cities. They established small Indian colonies, where they were joined by many Shoshone and, in the Reno area, Washoe people.

Later, the government created larger reservations at Pyramid Lake and Duck Valley, Nevada. By that time the pattern of small &quot;de facto&quot; reservations near cities or farm districts, often with mixed Northern Paiute and Shoshone populations, had been established. Starting in the early 20th century, the federal government began granting land to these colonies. Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, several individual colonies gained federal recognition as independent tribes.

==Mythology==
Humans have inhabited the area between the West and Northwest of the United States for over 11,000 years.

One version of how the Northern Paiute people came to be is that a bird, the Sagehen (also known as the Centrocercus), was the only bird that survived a massive flood. The Sagehen made a fire and cared for it until the fire grew bigger and bigger. The water from the flood dried, and a man &quot;happened.&quot; This man was called Nűműzóho, who was a cannibal. The Cannibals (as he and his kind were called) killed all the Native people, except for a woman who was able to escape. This woman kept herself alive by traveling from place to place in the region, meeting and staying with different characters. She then found a man living in the mountains whom she married. They bore four children: two Paiute (one brother, one sister) and two Pit Rivers (one brother, one sister). The two sets of children fought frequently because they were from different tribes. Their father (some think he was a Wolf) threw them in different waters. This caused them to go their separate ways while continuing to fight and quarrel whenever they came in contact with each other again. And thus the Paiute were created and their homes established in Nevada, California, and Oregon.

Another version of the creation story tells of a man and a woman who heard a voice from within a bottle. They dumped the contents of the bottle out, and four beings dropped out: two boys and two girls. The 4 people were divided by good and evil. The two good people (Paiute) were to be protected and cared for by the woman while the two bad people were subject to the man. The two sets of pairs (good and bad) left the man and woman. Each pair created fire: the two good people made a fire with minimal smoke, the two bad people made a fire with thick smoke. This made them enemies, even before foreigners plotted them against each other later on. War and strife have existed ever since.

While several other variations of these stories are told, they all share some similar events and characters. Namely Nűműzóho the Cannibal who kills almost all of the Indians but not the woman; Coyote is &quot;the one who fixed things,&quot; mentioned briefly in many of the origin stories; a man and a woman who meet and bear four children; the four children who are paired off into different tribes and quarrel with the other pair.

The creativity in which the stories were told is part of the reason for such an array of versions. These epic stories were first told long ago to large groups gathered around a fire. The season for story-telling in the American West was during the winter months. The elderly members of the tribe would animatedly and humorously tell the tale from their memory as told to them by previous elders and family members. They were told “as a way to pass on tribal visions of the animal people and the human people, their origins and values, their spiritual and natural environment, and their culture and daily lives.”

The stories were often poems that were performed musically, called &quot;song-poems.&quot; Members of the tribe chanted and acted out the stories to the beat of a drum with people dancing. The Northern Paiute origin story, among many other important and formative legends, was passed on orally from tribal elders to younger tribe members and from grandmothers and grandfathers to grandchildren. Many of their stories and much of their history is passed on orally even today.

==Gender roles==
Gender roles among the Northern Paiute did not stand out in society. Men and women divided the work between each other the most traditional way: women made household tools, gathered fruit and seeds, cooked, cleaned, cared for the children, and made the clothing, while men hunted and protected their families. Men also taught their sons how to hunt and fish as a means to pass on a survival skill. Both sexes took part in storytelling, artwork and medicine, and traditional medicine. As the Northern Paiute entered the 20th century, gender roles began to shift. Men worked in seasonal jobs and the women mainly worked in laundry and medicine. The shift happened because the men that worked seasonal jobs would not have work at the end of a given season, while women had consistent work. This made women a major provider in the family. Another shift came in the shape of politics. While some women disrupted tribe meetings, Sarah Winnemucca became a figure in the eyes of the public by making claims of being a princess and using this attention to advocate for her people.

==Medicine culture and beliefs==
Shamanism is popular among most Native American tribes, including the Northern Paiute people. A shaman is a medicine man called a puhagim by Northern Paiute people. The Northern Paiute believe in a force called puha that gives life to the physical world. It is the power that moves the elements, plants, and animals that are a part of that physical realm. Humans are seen to be very much a part of that world, not superior or inferior, simply another component. The Northern Paiute people believe that &quot;matter and places are pregnant in form, meaning, and relations to natural and human phenomena.&quot; This belief gave credibility and placed necessity in shamans, as it does today.

In order to draw upon the powers of nature and the universe, shamans would frequently visit sacred sites. These sites can be found throughout the Great Basin and the American West. They include &quot;mountains, caves, waterways, and unique geological formations.&quot; One such site is called the Parowan Gap and is sacred to the Paiute (see image). These sacred sites are where shamans performed many of their duties, including curing, rainmaking, warfare, fighting, or sorcery.&quot; Shamans were and are an integral part of the Northern Paiute community.

The Northern Paiute believe that doctors/shaman retrieve the souls of those who have committed wrongdoings and re-establish them in to Native American society. They are the intermediaries between the evil acts of the sick and the goodness of the healthy tribe. For this reason, Northern Paiute do not perceive white doctors as capable of fully healing those in need because although they may be able to cure the outer shell, the inner shell will decay and be lost, leaving the person dead in reality. A shaman, however, would take an ill person (physically or spiritually ill) and use the power from the universe to heal him. In many cases, a shaman will utilize various mediums, such as a rattle, smoke, and songs, to incite the power of the universe.

==Population==
Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber thought that the 1770 population of the Northern Paiute within California was 500. He estimated their population in 1910 as 300. Others put the total Northern Paiute population in 1859 at about 6,000.

<doc id="393093" wikidata="Q2635052" url="?curid=393093" title="Modoc War">
<text>The Modoc War, or the Modoc Campaign (also known as the Lava Beds War), was an armed conflict between the Native American Modoc people and the United States Army in northeastern California and southeastern Oregon from 1872 to 1873. Eadweard Muybridge photographed the early part of the US Army&#x27;s campaign.

Kintpuash, also known as Captain Jack, led 52 warriors in a band of more than 150 Modoc people who left the Klamath Reservation. Occupying defensive positions throughout the lava beds south of Tule Lake (in present-day Lava Beds National Monument), those few warriors resisted for months the more numerous United States Army forces sent against them, which were reinforced with artillery. In April 1873 at a peace commission meeting, Captain Jack and others killed General Edward Canby and Rev. Eleazer Thomas, and wounded two others, mistakenly believing this would encourage the Americans to leave. The Modoc fled back to the lava beds. After U.S. forces were reinforced, some Modoc warriors surrendered and Captain Jack and the last of his band were captured. Jack and five warriors were tried for the murders of the two peace commissioners. Jack and three warriors were executed and two others sentenced to life in prison.

The remaining 153 Modoc of the band were sent to Indian Territory (pre-statehood Oklahoma), where they were held as prisoners of war until 1909, settled on reservation land with the Shawnee. Some at that point were allowed to return to the Klamath Reservation in Oregon. Most Modoc (and their descendants) stayed in what became the state of Oklahoma. They achieved separate federal recognition and were granted some land in Oklahoma. There are two federally recognized Modoc tribes: in Oregon and Oklahoma.

==Events leading up to the war==
The first known explorers from the United States to go through the Modoc country were John Charles Frémont together with Kit Carson and Billy Chinook in 1843. On the night of May 9, 1846, Frémont received a message brought to him by Lieutenant Archibald Gillespie, from President James Polk about the possibility of war with Mexico. Reviewing the messages, Frémont neglected the customary measure of posting a watchman for the camp. Carson was concerned but &quot;apprehended no danger&quot;. Later that night Carson was awakened by the sound of a thump. Jumping up, he saw his friend and fellow trapper Basil Lajeunesse sprawled in blood. He sounded an alarm and immediately the camp realized they were under attack by Native Americans, estimated to be several dozen in number. By the time the assailants were beaten off, two other members of Frémont&#x27;s group were dead. The one dead attacker was judged to be a Klamath Lake native. Frémont&#x27;s group fell into &quot;an angry gloom.&quot;

In retaliation, Frémont attacked a Klamath Tribe fishing village named Dokdokwas, that most likely had nothing to do with the attack, at the junction of the Williamson River and Klamath Lake, on May 10, 1846. Accounts by scholars vary, but they agree that the attack completely destroyed the village structures; Sides reports the expedition killed women and children as well as warriors.

The tragedy of Dokdokwas is deepened by the fact that most scholars now agree that Frémont and Carson, in their blind vindictiveness, probably chose the wrong tribe to lash out against: In all likelihood the band of native Americans that had killed [Frémont&#x27;s three men] were from the neighboring Modoc ... The Klamaths were culturally related to the Modocs, but the two tribes were bitter enemies. 

Although most of the &quot;49ers&quot; missed the Modoc country, in March 1851 Abraham Thompson, a mule train packer, discovered gold near Yreka while traveling along the Siskiyou Trail from southern Oregon. The discovery sparked the California Gold Rush area to expand from the Sierra Nevada into Northeastern California. By April 1851, 2,000 miners had arrived in &quot;Thompson&#x27;s Dry Diggings&quot; through the southern route of the old Emigrant Trail to test their luck, which took them straight through Modoc territory.

===First hostilities===

Although the Modoc initially had no trouble with Americans, after the murders of settlers in a raid by the Pit River Tribe, an American militia unit, not familiar with the Indian peoples, retaliated by attacking an innocent Modoc village, killing men, women and children. (Kintpuash, the future chief also known as Captain Jack, survived the attack but lost some of his family.) To try to end the American encroachment, some Modoc chose to attack the next whites they encountered. In September 1852 the Modoc attacked a wagon train of some 65 men, women, and children on their way to California.

One badly wounded man escaped to the Oregon settlements in Willamette Valley and told of the attack. His report spread quickly and Oregon volunteers who later reached the scene, reported bodies of men, women and children mutilated and scattered for more than a mile along the lake shore and their wagons plundered and burned. The location became known as Bloody Point. In another round of retaliation, California militia led by an Indian fighter named Ben Wright killed 41 Modoc at a peace parley. John Schonchin, the brother of the Modoc chief, was one of the natives who escaped.

===Great Treaty of Council Grove===
Rounds of hostilities continued in the area as American settlers continued to encroach on Modoc land and urged the government to take over the territory. Warriors of the Klamath and the Yahooskin also attacked settlers and migrants in efforts to repulse them. In 1864 the United States and the Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin band—over 1000 Indians, mostly Klamath—signed a treaty, by which the Indians ceded millions of acres of lands and the US established the Klamath Reservation, within the boundaries of present-day Oregon. Under the treaty terms, the Modoc, with Old Chief &quot;Schonchin&quot; as their leader, gave up their lands in the Lost River, Tule Lake and Lower Klamath Lake regions of California, and moved to a reservation in the Upper Klamath River Valley. In return, the Indians would receive food, blankets, and clothing for as many years as would be required to establish themselves. Allen David signed for the Klamath, while Old Schonchin and Kintpuash for the Modoc. Looking around for something to give emphasis to his pledge, Schonchin pointed to the distant butte and dramatically declared, &quot;That mountain shall fall, before Schonchin will again raise his hand against his white brother.&quot; The old chief kept his word, although his brother and Kintpuash repudiated signing the treaty and left the reservation with a few followers.

===Captain Jack===
While the old Modoc chief remained in the reservation, Kintpuash returned to Lost River and led an abusive harassment against the white settlers who had occupied the area. The small Modoc group of about 43 Indians demanded rent for the occupation of their land, which most settlers paid. After a few attempts to negotiate in behalf of the complaining settlers, including failed attempts by Agent Lindsay Applegate in 1864–6 and Superintendent Huntington in 1867, the Modoc finally relocated in 1869 following a council between Kintpuash (also known as Captain Jack); Alfred B. Meacham, the US Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon that replaced Huntington; O.C. Knapp, the US Indian agent on the reservation; Ivan D. Applegate, sub-agent at Yainax on the reservation; and William.C. McKay. Meacham was from Oregon, and knew Captain Jack and the Modoc.

When soldiers suddenly appeared at the meeting, the Modoc warriors fled, leaving behind their women and children. Meacham placed the women and children in wagons and started for the reservation. He allowed &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, Captain Jack&#x27;s sister, to go meet with Captain Jack to persuade him to move to the reservation. She succeeded. Once on the reservation, Captain Jack and his band prepared to make their permanent home at Modoc Point.
===Mistreatment by the Klamath===
Shortly after the Modoc started building their homes, however, the Klamath, longtime rivals, began to steal the Modoc lumber. The Modoc complained, but the US Indian agent could not protect them against the Klamath. Captain Jack&#x27;s band moved to another part of the reservation. Several attempts were made to find a suitable location, but the Klamath continued to harass the band.

In 1870, Captain Jack and his band of nearly 200 left the reservation and returned to Lost River. During the months that his band had been on the reservation, a number of settlers had taken up former Modoc land in the Lost River region.

===Return to Lost River===

Acknowledging the bad feeling between the Modoc and the Klamath, Meacham recommended to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C. that Captain Jack&#x27;s Modoc band be given a separate reservation at Yainax, in the lower southern part of the reservation. Pending a decision, Meacham instructed Captain Jack to remain at Clear Lake. Oregon settlers complained that Modoc warriors roamed the countryside raiding the homesteads; they petitioned Meacham to return the Modoc to the Klamath Reservation. In part, the Modoc raided for food; the US did not adequately supply them. Captain Jack and his band did better in their old territory with hunting.

==Failure of US to respond to Modoc==
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs never responded to Meacham&#x27;s request for a separate reservation for the Modoc. After hearing more complaints from settlers, Meacham instead requested General Edward Canby, Commanding General of the Department of the Columbia, to move Captain Jack&#x27;s band to Yainax on the Klamath Reservation, his recommended site for their use. Canby forwarded Meacham&#x27;s request to General Schofield, Commanding General of the Pacific, suggesting that before using force, peaceful efforts should be made. Jack had asked to talk to Meacham, but he sent his brother John Meacham in his place.

In the middle of the crisis, the Commission of Indian Affairs replaced Meacham, appointing T. B. Odeneal as Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon. He &quot;knew almost nothing of the background of the situation and had never met Jack or the Modocs&quot; but was charged with &quot;getting the Modocs to leave Lost River.&quot; In turn, Odeneal appointed a new US Indian agent, who was also unfamiliar with the parties and conditions.

On April 3, 1872, Major Elmer Otis held a council with Captain Jack at Lost River Gap, near what is now Olene, Oregon. At the council, Major Otis presented Captain Jack with some settlers who complained about the behavior of Jack&#x27;s men. Captain Jack countered that the Modoc were abused and unjustly accused of crimes which other Indians had committed.

Although the council&#x27;s results were inconclusive, Otis resolved to remove Jack&#x27;s band of Modoc to the Klamath Reservation. As he needed reinforcements, he recommended waiting until later in the year, when he could put the Modoc at a disadvantage.

On April 12, the Commission of Indian Affairs directed US Superintendent T. B. Odeneal to move Captain Jack and his Modoc to the reservation if practicable. He was to ensure the tribe was protected from the Klamath.

On May 14, Odeneal sent Ivan D. Applegate and L. S. Dyar to arrange for a council with Captain Jack, which the latter refused. On July 6, 1872, the US Commissioner of Indian Affairs repeated his direction to Superintendent Odeneal to move Captain Jack and his band to the Klamath Reservation, peacefully if possible, but forcibly if necessary. Minor skirmishes occurred during the summer and early fall, but some of the settlers in California were sympathetic to the Modoc, as they had gotten along well with them before. The Modoc felt mistreated.

==Battle of Lost River==
On November 27, Superintendent Odeneal requested Major John Green, commanding officer at Fort Klamath, to furnish sufficient troops to compel Captain Jack to move to the reservation. On November 28 Captain James Jackson, commanding 40 troops, left Fort Klamath for Captain Jack&#x27;s camp on Lost River. The troops, reinforced by citizens from Linkville (now Klamath Falls, Oregon) and by a band of militiamen arrived in Jack&#x27;s camp on Lost River about a mile above Emigrant Crossing (now Merrill, Oregon) on November 29.

Wishing to avoid conflict, Captain Jack agreed to go to the reservation, but the situation became tense when Jackson demanded that the Modoc chief surrender his weapons. Although Captain Jack had never fought the Army, he was alarmed at this command, but he finally agreed to put down his weapons. The rest of the Modoc warriors began to follow his lead.

Suddenly an argument erupted between Modoc warrior Scarfaced Charley and Lieutenant Frazier A. Boutelle, of company B, 1st Cavalry. They drew their revolvers and shot at each other, both missing. The rest of the Modocs scrambled for their weapons, and briefly fought before fleeing toward California. After driving the remaining Modoc from the camp, Captain Jackson ordered a retreat to await reinforcements. One soldier had been killed and seven wounded in the encounter; the Modoc lost two killed and three wounded.

A small band of Modoc under Hooker Jim retreated from the battlefield to the Lava Beds south of Tule Lake. In attacks on November 29 and November 30, they killed a total of 18 settlers.

Accounts vary regarding the first clash. One version: that the soldiers and militia had gotten drunk in Klamath Falls and arrived at the Lost River camp disorganized and were outfought; that, furthermore, the militia arrived last and retreated first, with one casualty; and that the Army did not drive the Modoc away. This version claimed that some warriors held their ground while the women and children loaded their boats and paddled south; that Scarfaced Charley, who spoke good English, was foul-tempered from lack of sleep, because he&#x27;d been gambling all night and was possibly drunk—but, since there was a warrant out for his arrest on a false murder charge, he wasn&#x27;t going to go quietly. The official report, however, concealed that the operation had been badly managed, as Captain Jackson later admitted.

==Fortifying the Stronghold==
For some months, Captain Jack had boasted that in the event of war, he and his band could successfully defend themselves in an area in the lava beds on the south shore of Tule Lake. The Modoc retreated there after the Battle of Lost River. Today it is called Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold. The Modoc took advantage of the lava ridges, cracks, depressions, and caves, all such natural features being ideal from the standpoint of defense. At the time the 52 Modoc warriors occupied the Stronghold, Tule Lake bounded the Stronghold on the north and served as a source of water.

On December 21, a Modoc party scouting from the Stronghold attacked an ammunition wagon at Land&#x27;s Ranch. By January 15, 1873, the U.S. Army had 400 troops in the field near the Lava Beds. The greatest concentration of troops was at Van Brimmer&#x27;s ranch, 12 miles west of the Stronghold. Troops were also stationed at Land&#x27;s ranch, 10 miles east of the Stronghold. Col. Frank Wheaton was in command of all troops, including regular army as well as volunteer companies from California and Oregon.

On January 16, troops from Land&#x27;s ranch, commanded by Col. R. F. Bernard, skirmished with the Modoc near Hospital Rock.

==First battle of the Stronghold==

On the morning of January 17, 1873, troops advanced on the Stronghold. Hindered by fog, the soldiers never saw any Modoc. Occupying excellent positions, the Modoc repulsed troops advancing from the west and east. A general retreat of troops was ordered at the end of the day. In the attack, the U.S. Army lost 35 men killed, and 5 officers and 20 enlisted men wounded. Captain Jack&#x27;s band included approximately 150 Modoc, including women and children. Of that number, there were only 52 warriors. The Modoc suffered no casualties in the fighting, as they had the advantage of terrain and local knowledge over the militia.

==Peace Commission appointed==
On January 25, Columbus Delano, Secretary of the Interior, appointed a Peace Commission to negotiate with Captain Jack. The Commission consisted of Alfred B. Meacham, the former superintendent for Oregon as chairman; Jesse Applegate, and Samuel Case. General Edward Canby, commander in the Pacific Northwest, was appointed to serve the commission as counselor. Frank and Toby Riddle were appointed as interpreters. Toby Riddle (sometimes spelled as Tobey) was a Modoc woman and a cousin of Kintpuash.

On February 19, the Peace Commission held its first meeting at Fairchild&#x27;s ranch, west of the lava beds. A messenger was sent to arrange a meeting with Captain Jack. He agreed that if the commission would send John Fairchild and Bob Whittle, two settlers, to the edge of the lava beds he would talk to them. When Fairchild and Whittle went to the lava beds, Captain Jack told them he would talk with the commission if they would return with Judge Elijah Steele of Yreka as the judge had been friendly to Captain Jack.

Steele went to the Stronghold. After a night in the Stronghold, Steele returned to Fairchild&#x27;s ranch and informed the Peace Commission that the Modoc were planning treachery, and that all efforts of the commission would be useless. Meacham wired the Secretary of the Interior, informing him of Steele&#x27;s opinion. The Secretary instructed Meacham to continue negotiations for peace. Judge A. M. Rosborough was added to the commission. Jesse Applegate and Samuel Case resigned and were replaced by Rev. Eleazer Thomas and L. S. Dyar.

In April, Gillem&#x27;s Camp was established at the edge of the lava beds, two and one-half miles west of the Stronghold. Col. Alvan C. Gillem was placed in command of all troops, including those at Hospital Rock commanded by Col. E. C. Mason. 

On April 2, the commission and Captain Jack met in the lava beds midway between the Stronghold and Gillem&#x27;s Camp. At this meeting Captain Jack proposed: (1) Complete pardon of all Modoc; (2) Withdrawal of all troops; and (3) The right to select their own reservation. The Peace Commission proposed: (1) That Captain Jack and his band go to a reservation selected by the government; (2) That the Modoc guilty of killing the settlers be surrendered and tried for murder. After much discussion, the meeting broke up with no resolution.

The Modoc began to turn on Captain Jack, who still hoped for a peaceful solution. Led by Schonchin John and Hooker Jim, they put pressure on Jack to kill the peace commission. They believed that if the Americans lost their leaders, the Army would leave. They shamed Jack for his continuing negotiations by dressing him in women&#x27;s clothing during council meetings. Rather than lose his position as chief of the band, Captain Jack agreed to attack the commission if no progress was made.

On April 5, Captain Jack requested a meeting with Meacham. Accompanied by John Fairchild and Judge Rosborough, with Frank and Toby Riddle serving as interpreters, Meacham met Captain Jack at the peace tent; it was erected about one mile east of Gillem&#x27;s Camp. The meeting lasted several hours. Captain Jack asked for the lava beds to be given to them as a reservation. The meeting ended with no agreement. After Meacham returned to camp, he sent a message to Captain Jack, asking that he meet the commission at the peace tent on April 8. While delivering this message, the Modoc interpreter Tobey Riddle learned of the Modoc plan to kill the peace commissioners. On her return, she warned the commissioners.

On April 8, just as the commissioners were starting for the peace tent, the signal tower on the bluff above Gillem&#x27;s Camp received a message; it said that the lookout had seen five Modoc warriors at the peace tent and about 20 armed Modoc hiding among the rocks nearby. The commissioners realized that the Modoc were planning an attack and decided to stay at Gillem&#x27;s. Rev. Thomas insisted on arranging a date for another meeting with Captain Jack. On April 10, the commission sent a message asking Captain Jack to meet with them at the peace tent on the following morning.

==Murder at the peace tent==

On April 11, General Canby, Alfred B. Meacham, Rev. E. Thomas, and L. S. Dyar, with Frank and Toby Riddle as interpreters, met with Captain Jack, Boston Charley, Bogus Charley, Schonchin John, Black Jim, and Hooker Jim. After some talk, during which it became evident that the Modoc were armed, General Canby informed Captain Jack that the commission could not meet his terms until orders came from Washington.

Angrily, Schonchin John demanded Hot Creek for a reservation. Captain Jack got up and walked away a few steps. The two Modoc Brancho (Barncho) and Slolux, armed with rifles, ran forward from hiding. Captain Jack turned, giving the signal to fire. His first shot killed General Canby. Reverend Thomas fell mortally wounded. Dyar and Frank Riddle escaped by running. Meacham fell seriously wounded, but Toby Riddle saved his life and interrupted warriors intending to scalp him by yelling, &quot;The soldiers are coming!&quot; The Modoc warriors broke off and left.

US efforts for peace ended when the Modoc killed the commissioners. Canby&#x27;s Cross marks the site where Canby and Thomas died.

==Second Battle of the Stronghold==
The U.S. Army prepared to attack the Stronghold. On April 15 a general attack began, troops advancing from Gillem&#x27;s camp on the west and Mason&#x27;s camp at Hospital Rock, northeast of the Stronghold. Fighting continued throughout the day, the troops remaining in position during the night. Each advance of troops on April 16 was under heavy fire from the Modoc positions. That night the troops succeeded in cutting the Modoc off from their water supply at the shore of Tule Lake. By the morning of April 17 everything was in readiness for the final attack on the Stronghold. When the order was given to advance, the troops charged into the Stronghold.

After the fighting along the shoreline of Tule Lake on the afternoon and night of April 16, the Modoc defending the Stronghold realized that their water supply had been cut off by the troops commanding the shoreline. On April 17, before the troops had begun to charge the Stronghold, the Modoc escaped through an unguarded crevice. During the fighting at the Stronghold, April 15–17, US casualties included one officer and six enlisted men killed, and thirteen enlisted men wounded. Modoc casualties were two boys, reported to have been killed when they tried to open a cannonball and it exploded. Several Modoc women were reported to have died from sickness.

==Battle of Sand Butte==
On April 26, Captain Evan Thomas commanding five officers, sixty-six troops and fourteen Warm Spring Scouts left Gillem&#x27;s camp on a reconnaissance of the lava beds to locate the Modoc. While they were eating lunch at the base of Sand Butte (now Hardin Butte), in a flat area surrounded by ridges, Captain Thomas and his party were attacked by 22 Modoc led by Scarfaced Charley. Some of the troops fled in disorder. Those who remained to fight were either killed or wounded. US casualties included four officers killed and two wounded, one dying within a few days, and 13 enlisted men killed and 16 wounded.

Following the successful Modoc attack, many soldiers called for Col. Gillem to be removed. On May 2, Bvt. Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis, the new commander of the Department of the Columbia, reported to relieve Gillem of command, and assume control of the army in the field.

==Battle of Dry Lake==
At first light on May 10, the Modoc attacked an Army encampment at Dry Lake. The troops charged, routing the Modoc. Casualties among the Army included five men killed, two of whom were Warm Spring Scouts, and twelve men wounded. The Modoc reported five warriors killed. Among the five was Ellen&#x27;s Man, a prominent man in the band. This was the first defeat of the Modoc in battle.

With the death of Ellen&#x27;s Man, dissent arose among the Modoc, who began to split apart. A group led by Hooker Jim surrendered to the Army and agreed to help them capture Captain Jack. In return, they received amnesty for the murders of settlers at Tule Lake, Canby and Thomas.

Captain Jack, his wife, and young daughter were captured by army scouts; Captain William F. Drannan, U.S. Army and Scout George Jones, U.S. Army in Langell&#x27;s valley, June 4. 

==After the war==
General Davis prepared to execute Captain Jack and his leaders, but the War Department ordered the Modoc to be held for trial. The Army took Captain Jack and his band as prisoners of war to Fort Klamath, where they arrived July 4.

Captain Jack, Schonchin John, Black Jim, Boston Charley, Brancho (Barncho) and Slolux were tried by a military court for the murders of Canby and Thomas, and attacks on Meacham and others. The six Modoc were convicted, and sentenced to death on July 8.

On September 10, President Ulysses S. Grant approved the death sentence for Captain Jack, Schonchin John, Black Jim and Boston Charley; Brancho and Slolux were committed to life imprisonment on Alcatraz. Grant ordered that the remainder of Captain Jack&#x27;s band be held as prisoners of war.

On October 3, 1873, Captain Jack and his three lead warriors were hanged at Fort Klamath. The remainder of the band of Modoc Indians, consisting of 39 men, 64 women, and 60 children, as prisoners of war were sent to the Quapaw Agency in Indian Territory (Oklahoma). In 1909, after Oklahoma had become a state, members of the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma were offered the chance to return to the Klamath Reservation. Twenty-nine people returned to Oregon; the Modoc of Oregon and their descendants became part of the Klamath Tribes Confederation.

The historian Robert Utley believes that the Modoc War and the Great Sioux War a few years later undermined public confidence in President Grant&#x27;s peace policy. There was renewed public sentiment to use force against the American Indians to suppress them.

==Appendix to history of the Modoc War==
In the First Battle of the Stronghold, January 17, 1873, there were approximately 400 Army troops in the field. The troops included U. S. Army infantry, cavalry, and howitzer units; Oregon and California volunteer companies, and some Klamath Indian Scouts. Lt. Col. Frank Wheaton commanded all troops.

In the Second Battle of the Stronghold, April 17, 1873, approximately 530 troops were engaged. These included U. S. Army infantry, cavalry, artillery and the U.S. Army Wasco Scouts from the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. The volunteer companies had withdrawn from the field. A small number of civilians were used as runners and packers. Col. Alvin C. Gillem was in command.

During the Modoc War, the Modoc had no more than 53 warriors engaged in the fighting.

The casualty lists for the Modoc War are as follows:

Including the four Modoc executed at Fort Klamath, Captain Jack&#x27;s band suffered the loss of seventeen warriors killed.

The Modoc War is estimated to have cost the United States over $400,000; a very expensive war in terms of lives and dollars, considering the small number of opposing forces. In contrast, the estimated cost to purchase the land requested by the Modoc for a separate reservation was $20,000.
Battlefields of the Modoc War are among the outstanding features of the Lava Beds National Monument. These include Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold, where numerous cracks, ridges, and knobs were used by the Modoc to defend their positions. In addition there are numerous Modoc fortified outposts, smoke-stained caves occupied by the Modoc during the months of the war, corrals for their cattle and horses, and a war-dance ground and council area. Around the Stronghold are numerous low stone fortifications built by troops advancing on the Stronghold.

After the Modoc left the Stronghold, US troops built fortifications to protect against their possible return. The Thomas-Wright battlefield, near Hardin Butte, is a feature of the monument; as is the site of Gillem&#x27;s camp, the former military cemetery, Hospital Rock, and Canby&#x27;s Cross. The National Park Service provides self-guided trail maps for two walking tours of the battle field.

==Legacy==

===Canby&#x27;s memorial plaque and cross===
A memorial plaque and a reproduction of Canby&#x27;s Cross have been set up at Lava Beds National Monument outside of Tulelake. The names of all the fallen (both Modoc and US Army) are listed at Gillem&#x27;s Camp; another historical marker is at the Lava Beds.

Over the years, various individuals and groups have made efforts to memorialize the death of General E.R.S. Canby, the only general to be killed in the Indian Wars. The wooden cross is a replica of an original erected by a U.S. soldier in 1882, nine years after the event. Some of the same troops whom Canby had commanded at the Lava Beds were fighting other Indian Wars, and public interest ran high.

===California Historical Landmark===
On California State Route 139 and the Old Alturas Highway is a California Historical Landmark # 108 the Battle of Land&#x27;s Ranch.

California Historical Landmark number 108 reads:
:&quot;NO. 108 BATTLE OF LAND&#x27;S RANCH-1872 - One of the engagements of the Modoc War took place on December 21, 1872, on what was then known as the Land&#x27;s Ranch. Army supply wagons, escorted by cavalrymen, had reached camp in safety, but several of the soldiers who had dropped behind were suddenly attacked by Indians hiding among the rocks above the road. Two men were killed and several wounded.&quot;

<doc id="393094" wikidata="Q233837" url="?curid=393094" title="Britt Ekland">
<text>Britt Ekland (born Britt-Marie Eklund; 6 October 1942) is a Swedish actress, model, and singer. She appeared in numerous films in her heyday throughout the 1960s and 1970s, including roles in &quot;The Double Man&quot; (1967), &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; (1968), &quot;Machine Gun McCain&quot; (1969), &quot;Stiletto&quot; (1969), and the British crime film &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971), which established her as a sex symbol. She also starred in several horror films, including &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973), and appeared as a Bond girl in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974). 

Ekland continued to act throughout the 1970s, with roles in films such as &quot;The Ultimate Thrill&quot; (1974), &quot;Royal Flash&quot; (1975), &quot;High Velocity&quot; (1976), and &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Treasure&quot; (1979), and into the 1980s, starring in the likes of &quot;Fraternity Vacation&quot; (1985), &quot;Moon in Scorpio&quot; (1987), and &quot;Scandal&quot; (1989). Since the early 1990s her acting work has mainly consisted of stage shows, one-off roles, cameos, and appearances on reality television.

Her high-profile social life, her 1964 marriage to actor Peter Sellers, and her relationship with singer Rod Stewart attracted considerable press attention, making her one of the world&#x27;s most photographed celebrities during the 1970s.

==Early life==
Ekland was born Britt-Marie Eklund in Stockholm, Sweden to Maj Britt, a secretary, and Sven Eklund, who ran an upmarket clothing store in Stockholm and was captain of the Swedish national curling team, four-time national champion and one-time president of the World Curling Federation. Ekland&#x27;s mother died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the 1980s, which had a profound effect on her.

Ekland grew up with three younger brothers, and has said that she was overweight for much of her childhood: &quot;I was very heavy. God, I was brutal-looking. I always tried to be funny to make up for the fact that I was fat and ugly&quot;. As a teenager, Ekland left school to travel with a theatre company and was spotted in a coffee shop in Italy by a talent agent who sent her to London to audition for films.

==Career==
Ekland had small roles in the Swedish films &quot;Kort är sommaren&quot; (1962) and &quot;Det är hos mig han har varit&quot; (1963), before landing her first major supporting part in the George Marshall Western &quot;Advance to the Rear&quot; (1964).

In the same year Ekland was originally cast in the dramatic role of Karen Eriksson in the British film &quot;Guns at Batasi&quot; starring Richard Attenborough, Jack Hawkins, Flora Robson, and sixties heartthrob actor/singer John Leyton. However she left the Pinewood production after only three weeks into filming due to tension with her new husband Peter Sellers, who was apparently so paranoid about Ekland having an affair with Leyton he secretly asked his old acting friends, David Lodge and Graham Stark who were co-starring in the picture, to keep an eye on her. After being quizzed nightly on the telephone by Sellers about her scenes and who she was with, Ekland left the shoot to join Sellers in Los Angeles. Ekland has said that Sellers insisted that she leave the set, come to America, then claim that an illness prevented her from returning. Her role was quickly recast and completed by Mia Farrow. In response 20th Century Fox sued Ekland for $1.5 million; Sellers counter-sued for $4 million claiming the Fox suit caused him &quot;mental distress and injury to his health&quot;.

In 1964 she appeared in the Christmas television film &quot;A Carol for Another Christmas&quot; with her husband Peter Sellers. She followed this with &quot;After the Fox&quot; (1966), also starring Sellers; she made one more film with Sellers, &quot;The Bobo&quot; (1967). This was followed with a lead role as an Amish girl turned New York City burlesque dancer in William Friedkin&#x27;s musical &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; (1968), which earned Ekland critical acclaim. Next came &quot;Stiletto&quot; (1969), a crime drama, based on a novel by Harold Robbins, co-starring Alex Cord. She then starred in a string of Italian films, &quot;Machine Gun McCain&quot; (1969), &quot;The Conspirators&quot; (1969), and as Antigone in &quot;The Cannibals&quot; (1970).

In 1971 she was cast as a leading lady and gun moll in the crime film &quot;Get Carter&quot;, opposite Michael Caine, which firmly established her as a blonde bombshell. The 1970s also saw Ekland in several horror films, including &quot;What the Peeper Saw&quot; (1972) as a disturbed bride; the Agatha Christie adaptation &quot;Endless Night&quot; (1972), playing the friend and companion of an American heiress; and as a hallucinatory figure in the anthology film &quot;Asylum&quot; (1972) opposite Charlotte Rampling. Her best known 
horror role came in 1973s &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, in which she played a Pagan villager and seductress; however, her voice was dubbed in the film to disguise her Swedish-accented English.

Other roles included in the thriller &quot;The Ultimate Thrill&quot; (1974) and the British drama &quot;Baxter!&quot; (1973). On television, she was cast in the TV film &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man: Wine, Women and War&quot; (1973) opposite Lee Majors. Ekland&#x27;s next prominent role came when she was cast as the Bond girl, Mary Goodnight, in the James Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), which received mixed reviews but furthered Ekland&#x27;s status as a sex symbol. She played a comedy role in &quot;Royal Flash&quot;, which has been described as &quot;perhaps her best screen work&quot;.

In 1976 Ekland provided the French spoken part at the end of then-boyfriend Rod Stewart&#x27;s single &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night (Gonna Be Alright)&quot;. Ekland also portrayed biographical characters, such as the one based on real-life actress Anny Ondra (boxer Max Schmeling&#x27;s wife) in the television film &quot;Ring of Passion&quot; (1978). Ekland was also featured in the horror films &quot;The Monster Club&quot; (1980) and &quot;Satan&#x27;s Mistress&quot; (1982).

In 1978 she hosted a syndicated television series for American International Television called &quot;Jukebox.&quot; Directed by Bruce Gowers and produced and written by Paul Flattery for Jon Roseman Productions, the series featured then-nascent music videos, most of which were originally produced by Roseman&#x27;s companies in the United States and England.

Ekland had supporting roles in independent feature films. She appeared in the comedy film &quot;Fraternity Vacation&quot; (1985), followed by a role in the slasher film &quot;Moon in Scorpio&quot; (1988), and as prostitute Mariella Novotny in the feature &quot;Scandal&quot; (1989) about the Profumo affair.

She has guest-starred on various television series, including an appearance on the popular TV series &quot;Superboy&quot;, playing an alien disguised as Lara, Superboy&#x27;s biological mother, during the show&#x27;s second season in 1990. Ekland published a beauty and fitness book, &quot;Sensual Beauty: How to Achieve It&quot; (1984), followed by a fitness video in 1992. In the BBC television series &quot;I Love the &#x27;70s&quot; (1999), she hosted the 1971 episode in homage to her role in the film &quot;Get Carter&quot;.

Ekland&#x27;s later career has mainly consisted of stage and television, with her last feature film role being in &quot;The Children&quot; (1990). She appeared on stage as a cast member in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Regent Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent in December 1999 and January 2000. She also appeared in &quot;Grumpy Old Women Live&quot; and participated in the Swedish reality show &quot;Stjärnorna på slottet&quot; (&quot;The stars at the castle&quot;) along with Peter Stormare, Arja Saijonmaa, Jan Malmsjö, and Magnus Härenstam. In December 2007 and January 2008 she starred again in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Wyvern Theatre, Swindon. She appeared as a guest on the British daytime television show &quot;Loose Women&quot;, in January 2008. From December 2008 to January 2009 Ekland starred in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Shaw Theatre in London. In a rare instance of her singing, she performed the song &quot;My Prince&quot;, originally recorded by Lara Pulver on the album &quot;Act One – Songs from the Musicals of Alexander S. Bermange&quot;. In 2009–10 she played the Fairy Godmother in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at Princess Theatre, Torquay. In December 2010 she starred as the &#x27;Fairy Pea Pod&#x27; in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; at the Kings Theatre, Southsea. She starred in further pantomimes at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, in 2011 and 2012.

In 2010 Ekland took part in the reality TV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, where she was the fourth celebrity to be voted off the show. Ekland was one of the housewives of &quot;Svenska Hollywoodfruar&quot; (English: Swedish Hollywood Wives) on TV3 from 2012 to 2014. In 2018 she participated in &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; broadcast on TV4. She was the first to be eliminated on 30 March, placing 11th.

In 2020 Ekland appeared in Season 4 of BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Real Marigold Hotel&quot;. Also in 2020, she toured the country in a production of &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot;, playing Mrs. Pleasant. Although the production halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it resumed touring in late 2021.

==Writing==
Britt Ekland&#x27;s autobiography &quot;True Britt&quot; was published in 1980 by Prentice-Hall, Inc. The book is an archetypal celebrity tell-all, chronicling her marriage to Peter Sellers and subsequent relationship with Rod Stewart.

Ekland is also the author of one novel, &quot;Det Ljuva Livet (Sweet Life)&quot;.

In 2024, Ekland contributed an introduction to the LGBT+ horror novel, &quot;The Sugar Pit&quot; by William Jackson, published by the Cambridge Queer Press. Ekland refers to the illusory nature of all fiction. For The Wicker Man, spring had to be faked by glueing leaves to trees as principal photography took place in the autumn and Ekland herself was pregnant requiring some of her nude scenes to be filmed with a body double.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Ekland became famous overnight as a result of her 1964 whirlwind romance and marriage to English actor and comedian Peter Sellers, who proposed after seeing her photograph in the paper and then meeting her in London. She stood by him after he suffered a series of heart attacks shortly after their marriage. Ekland was stepmother to Sellers&#x27;s children Sarah and Michael (who died of a heart attack at about the same age as his father). In January 1965 they had a daughter, Victoria. The couple made three films together, &quot;A Carol for Another Christmas&quot; (1964), &quot;After the Fox&quot; (1966), and &quot;The Bobo&quot; (1967), before divorcing in 1968.

On 17 December 1968, Mr Justice Alan Orr granted Ekland a decree nisi for divorce in the High Court on the grounds of cruelty by Sellers, who did not contest the proceedings.

In June 1973, Ekland had a son, Nicolai Adler, with record producer Lou Adler. 

She also had a much publicised romance with rock star Rod Stewart. They were introduced in 1975 by Joan Collins and lived together for more than two years, with Ekland giving up her career to focus on their relationship.

From 1979 to 1981, she dated and became engaged to singer Phil Lewis of the groups Girl and L.A. Guns.

In 1984, at age 42, she married Stray Cats drummer Slim Jim Phantom, who was 23. They had a son, Thomas Jefferson, in 1988. They divorced in 1992.

==Legacy==
While Rod Stewart&#x27;s domestic partner, Ekland inspired his hit song &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night (Gonna Be Alright),&quot; which was 1977&#x27;s overall #1 song. The song features a French spoken part by Ekland.

In 2004, Charlize Theron portrayed Ekland in &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;. Ekland accompanied Theron to the Cannes Film Festival, where she became highly emotional when she saw the film.

In the 2018 film &quot;My Dinner with Hervé&quot;, Helena Mattsson played Ekland.

<text>Inga-Lill Kristina &quot;Lili&quot; Päivärinta (born 5 January 1966) is a Swedish singer and artist of Finnish ancestry.

==Career==
She scored a number of hits with the duo Lili &amp; Susie, a duo with her sister Susie Päivärinta, in the 1980s and early 1990s, several of which made the Swedish music charts.

Päivärinta has been a strong proponent of animal rights since she was a child. During 2000, Päivärinta filmed how she cared for animals, which resulted in a mini-series on TV4 that eventually lead to the long-running TV4 animal show &quot;Djurens Ö&quot;, where she showcases her job as an animal lifesaver. She is a vegetarian. Themes about animal rights have been featured regularly in Päivärinta&#x27;s music and videos. She contributed to the album &quot;Building On Tradition&quot; by Andy McCoy. She also appeared as a regular in the TV-series Djurens hjältar broadcast on TV3.

<doc id="393100" wikidata="Q50329" url="?curid=393100" title="Cheorwon County">
<text>Cheorwon County (&quot;Cheorwon-gun&quot; ), also spelled Chorwon, is a county in Gangwon Province, South Korea. It is located right next to the North Korean border.

==History==
*Goguryeo – first named &quot;Moeuldongbi&quot;.
*Silla dynasty – name changed to &quot;Cheolseong&quot;.
**During the Later Three Kingdoms period of Korea, Gung Ye determined it capital of Taebong.
*Goryeo dynasty
**In 918, during the rule of King Taejo of Goryeo, its name was changed to Cheorwon and then renamed as &quot;Dongju&quot;.
*Joseon dynasty
**King Taejong changed its name into &#x27;Dohobu&#x27;.
**In 26th year of King Sejong&#x27;s reign (1434), it was transferred from Gyeonggi-do to Gangwon.
**On May 26 of the King Gojong, altered to Chuncheon-bu.

===Korean War===
Following the Division of Korea in 1945, all of Cheorwon County was part of North Korea.

During the Korean War the region changed hands several times during the UN invasion of North Korea and the Chinese invasion of South Korea, by 1951 the frontlines had stabilized, cutting across Cheorwon County and the area became part of the Iron Triangle. The Battle of Arrowhead Hill took place north of Cheorwon town from 6 to 10 October 1952 and the Battle of White Horse Hill took place north of Cheorwon town from 6 to 15 October 1952. The Battle of Triangle Hill took place north of Gimhwa-eup from 14 October to 25 November 1952.

Following the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Korean Demilitarized Zone divided Cheorwon County in two, creating Cheorwon County in South Korea and Chorwon County in North Korea, respectively.
Several Korean War sites in Cheorwon County are now tourist destinations including the former Woljeong-ri station, the former Korean Workers’ Party Office, the Iron Triangle Tourist Office, the Second Incursion Tunnel and the Cheorwon Peace Observatory.

=== Civilian Control Line (CCL) ===
The Civilian Control Line is an additional buffer zone to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The distance between the DMZ and CCL in South Korea ranges from 5 to 20 km (3.1 to 12.4 mi). The purpose is to limit and control the entrance of civilians into areas to protect and maintain the security of military facilities and operations near the DMZ.

== Tourism ==

For South Korea, tourism has been important since the 1962 Five Year Development Plan. This designated a key economic development sector and a &#x27;patriotic industry&#x27; (Hunter, 153). Historically nationalistic or patriotic perspectives have driven for the development of tourism in South Korea. Well organized tours and defined monuments and sites ensure these bordering areas are populated with visitors that participate in the symbolic landscape promoted by the South Korean government (Hunter, 153).

Described as &quot;a scene of bloody battles&quot; (n.d) and an area of tense border activity, the front-line county of Cheorwon presents a paradox. This historical county is infrequently visited by Western tourists. To understand the historical context of the Korean War, Cheorwon County offers significant insight into the conflict between North and South Korea.

=== The Second Tunnel ===
&quot;Found in the DMZ&quot; (n.d) was found by Korean guards listening to the sound of explosions under the ground during their shift. After determined excavation on March 19, 1975, &quot;The Second Tunnel&quot; was discovered. The second tunnel was for a sudden raid by the North Korean Army into South Korea. The second tunnel is composed of a firm granitic layer, is 3.5 km (2.17 mi) in length, and various in depth from 50m-160m (164 ft-525 ft).

=== Cheorwon Peace Observatory ===
&quot;Cheorwon Peace Observatory&quot; (n.d) is located at Junggang-ri, Dongsong-eup, South Korea. The Observatory is three stories high with a basement and was opened in November 2007. The observatory&#x27;s first floor is the exhibition hall and the second floor is an observatory. Tourists on the second floor can observe the surrounding ecosystem, fortress of Gung-Ye Cast town, Pyeonggang tableland, and Seonjeon town of North Korea in the DMZ.

=== Memorial Tower of the Baekma Goji (White Horse) Battle ===
During ten days of battle, the hill would change hands 24 times after repeated attacks and counterattacks for its possession. The original shape of the hill was transformed from more than 300,000 artillery shells and bombs. The destroyed ridge looked like a white horse lying down, so it was named Baekma Goji, meaning white horse hill.

=== Victory Observatory ===
&quot;At the center of the 155 miles&quot; (n.d) of the cease-fire line is the Victory Observatory. While visiting the Victory Observatory tourists can stare at Soldiers from the North Korean army, and the actual sites of the national division such as Geumgansan Railroad, Gwangasm Plain, and Achim-ri town.

<text>Goseong (; ) is a county in Gangwon Province, South Korea.

Prior to the 1953 Armistice which ceased the Korean War, Goseong (which is located north of the 38th parallel) was a part of North Korea. Kaesong, which is south of the 38th parallel and a part of South Korea before 1953, became part of the North after the Armistice.

== Festival ==
The Goseong Lavender Festival is held every June. The lavender festival has a concert, a trial performance of lavender perfume, and a variety of lavender classes. In addition, there are programs that can be enjoyed by anyone from children to the elderly, such as lavender pizza making, children&#x27;s drawing contest, and poetry making.

==2019 fire==

On April 4, 2019, high winds led to a high-voltage power line owned by Korea Electric Power Corporation to fall, causing an electric arc. The fire spread to the cities of Sokcho, Inje, Donghae and Gangneung, resulting in two deaths, over 30 injuries and the evacuation of over 4,000 residents. The fire burned 1,307 acres (5.3 km2) and damaged some 200 homes and 2,000 buildings, causing estimated damage of KRW 5.2 billion ($4.6 million). More than 13,000 firefighters were mobilized nationwide to fight the fire. By April 6-7, the fire was extinguished.

<doc id="393105" wikidata="Q1016169" url="?curid=393105" title="Largs">
<text>Largs () is a town on the Firth of Clyde in North Ayrshire, Scotland, about from Glasgow. The original name means &quot;the slopes&quot; (&quot;An Leargaidh&quot;) in Scottish Gaelic.

A popular seaside resort with a pier, the town markets itself on its historic links with the Vikings and an annual festival is held each year in early September. In 1263 it was the site of the Battle of Largs between the Norwegian and the Scottish armies. The National Mòd has also been held here in the past.

==History==
There is evidence of human activity in the vicinity of Largs which can be dated to the Neolithic era. The Haylie Chambered Tomb in Douglas Park dates from c. 3000 BC.

Largs evolved from the estates of North Cunninghame over which the Montgomeries of Skelmorlie became temporal lords in the seventeenth century. Sir Robert Montgomerie built Skelmorlie Aisle in the ancient kirk of Largs in 1636 as a family mausoleum. Today the monument is all that remains of the old kirk.


From its beginnings as a small village around its kirk, Largs evolved into a busy and popular seaside resort in the nineteenth century. Large hotels appeared and the pier was constructed in 1834. It was not until 1895, however, that the railway made the connection to Largs, sealing the town&#x27;s popularity.

It also became a fashionable place to live in and several impressive mansions were built, the most significant of which included &#x27;Netherhall&#x27;, the residence of William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, the physicist and engineer.

Largs has historical connections much further back, however. It was the site of the Battle of Largs in 1263, in which parts of a Scottish army attacked a small force of Norwegians attempting to salvage ships from a fleet carrying the armies of King Magnus Olafsson of Mann and the Isles and his liege lord King Haakon IV of Norway, beached during a storm. The Norwegians and islemen had been raiding the Scottish coast for some time, and the Scots under Alexander III had been following the fleet, attempting to catch its raiding parties. The outcome of this confrontation is uncertain, as both sides claim victory in their respective chronicles and sagas and the only independent source of the war fails to mention the battle at all. The battle was followed soon after by the death of the 59 year old King Haakon in Bishop&#x27;s Palace on Orkney. Following the king&#x27;s demise, his more lenient son Magnus VI of Norway agreed the Treaty of Perth in 1266, under which the Hebrides were sold to Scotland, as was the Isle of Man after the demise of Magnus Olafsson.

The Largs war memorial dates from 1920 and was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.

During World War II, the Hollywood Hotel was designated HMS &quot;Warren&quot;, which was Headquarters, Combined Training. A conference was held there between 28 June 1943 and 2 July 1943, code name RATTLE, under Lord Louis Mountbatten. It was known as the &quot;Field of the Cloth of Gold&quot; (named after a famous historic event) because of the number of high-ranking officers taking part. The decision that the invasion of Europe would take place in Normandy was made at this conference. King Haakon VII of Norway, then in exile in Britain due to the German occupation of his kingdom, visited Largs in 1944 and was made the town&#x27;s first honorary citizen.

Largs was (from the summer of 2017) the first place in the world to introduce a fully integrated system to activate pedestrian crossings using a series of Neateboxes. This system allows visually or physically impaired persons to activate the crossing button with no actual requirement to find or push the button, and will be of great benefit to the disabled community.

==Culture==
Largs has hosted the National Mòd in 1956, 1965 and 2002.

Theatres and venues include Barrfields Pavilion and the Vikingar centre.

In 2014, it was rated one of the most attractive postcode areas to live in Scotland.

The town is home to the children&#x27;s theatre company The McDougalls who have headquarters in the town.

Largs hosts the popular &quot;Largs Live&quot; on the last weekend in June with live music around pubs, restaurants and other venues over Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

==Public transport==
The town is served by Largs railway station with regular services to and from Glasgow Central station.

==Places of interest==

Despite its diminished status as a holiday resort, much of Largs is still geared towards tourism. The Vikingar Centre at Barrfields is an interactive look into the history of Viking life; Kelburn Country Centre, Barrfields Pavilion Theatre, Largs Swimming Pool, Douglas Park and Inverclyde National Sports Training Centre are other attractions. Nardinis is a famous ice cream parlour, cafe and restaurant, that dominates the Esplanade and which reopened in late 2008 following clearance from Historic Scotland and major renovation works. St. Columba&#x27;s Parish Church is situated opposite Nardinis and contains a Heritage Centre. The church itself was built in 1892 and is notable for its stained glass windows and Willis organ.

There is a neolithic tomb behind Douglas Park. Known as the Haylie Chambered Tomb, it was once covered by a cairn of stones (known as Margaret&#x27;s Law). When it was uncovered in the early twentieth century the tomb was dated to around 3000 to 2000 BC.

Skelmorlie Aisle, adjoining the local museum, is in the care of Historic Scotland and is open during the summer.

Kelburn Castle, situated between Largs and Fairlie, is the ancestral home of the Boyle (originally de Boyville) family, the hereditary Earls of Glasgow. Kelburn is believed to be the oldest castle in Scotland to have been continuously inhabited by the same family. The de Boyvilles who originated in Caen in Normandy came up after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The forebears of the modern day Boyles settled at Kelburn around 1140.

The Noddsdale Water flows from the north to reach the sea at the north end of Largs, and Brisbane House sited in the dale about up the river was the birthplace of the soldier and Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane, whose name was given to the city of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia, and, in 1823, to &quot;Brisbane Water&quot; on the NSW Central Coast. Noddsdale was renamed Brisbane Glen in his honour.

The &#x27;Prophet&#x27;s Grave&#x27; is located in the Brisbane Glen close to Middleton Farm. In 1647 the Reverend William Smith died from the &#x27;plague&#x27; whilst ministering to his parishioners who had temporarily forsaken Largs as a result of the aforementioned plague. William asked to be buried in the glen next to the Noddsdale Water and prophesied that if the two rowan trees planted at either end of his grave were prevented from touching then the plague would never return to Largs. The grave is in a delightful spot during the day and was a popular tourist attraction with postcards available and a thorough restoration in 1956. Night visits, however, have resulted in reports of ghost sightings and unusual phenomenon. The prophecy has been of debatable efficacy. However it has meant that his grave has been well looked after for around four hundred years.

A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service runs from Largs to Great Cumbrae, and the paddle steamer &quot;Waverley&quot; also calls in at the pier during cruises. The town is served by Largs railway station on the railway line from Glasgow to North Ayrshire (the Ayrshire Coast Line), and also lies on the main A78 road. It remains a popular destination for holiday-makers and weekenders from Glasgow all year round.

<text>The former Royal Burgh of Lauder (, ) is a town in the Scottish Borders in the historic county of Berwickshire. On the Southern Upland Way, the burgh lies southeast of Edinburgh, on the western edge of the Lammermuir Hills.

==Etymology==

Although Lauder sits in the valley of Leader Water, Watson notes that the names Lauder and Leader appear to be unconnected. In the earliest sources Lauder appears as &quot;Lawedder&quot; and &quot;Loweder&quot;. The name may be derived from the Brittonic &quot;lǭwadr&quot;, meaning &quot;washing or bathing place&quot; (Breton &quot;laouer&quot;). Or else, Lauder may be named from a word related to Middle Welsh &quot;llawedrawr&quot;, &quot;a heap of ruins&quot;.

==Medieval history==

Below Lauder are the lands of Kedslie which were bounded on the west by a road called &quot;Malcolm&#x27;s rode&quot;, and it is thought this formed part of the Roman road known as Dere Street, which passed through Lauder. Hardie suggests that it had been reconditioned by Malcolm III for use in his almost constant warfare against England. It is the only old road in Scotland that is associated with the name of an individual person.

The ancient settlement was further up the hills on the edge of the Moor. The present town of Lauder existed as a kirk-town in the time of David I (1124–53), or from in the latter half of the twelfth century. The town was once surrounded by walls with gates commonly referred to as &#x27;ports&#x27;. Two major mills, which dated from the 12th century, also served the town.

With the introduction of the feudal system to Scotland by David I, a provincial Lordship of Regality of Lauderdale, had been created for the King&#x27;s favourite, Hugh de Morville (who founded Dryburgh Abbey), which covered an extensive amount of territory, although Thomson states that the family of de Lawedre were &quot;there in the previous century.&quot; About 1170 Richard de Morville, Constable of Scotland, made a donation to the Brethren of the Hospital at Lauder, in 1245 a chapter of the clergy of East Lothian met at Lauder, and between 1248 and 1252 Emericus is recorded as Rector of Lauder.

Joseph Bain states that the de Morville&#x27;s held one-third of half Lauder and Lauderdale for one knight&#x27;s service. It would appear that de Morville&#x27;s superiority did not extend over the entire valley of Lauderdale which, by his own demarcation recorded in the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot;, stopped at the Lauder burn south of the town. This appears to be confirmed by the fact that a charter mentions Hugo de Morville possessing half of the mill of Lauder being the mill lands and rights south of the Lauder Burn, the other half being in the possession of the Lauder family. De Morville&#x27;s inheritance passed to Alan of Galloway and later, to his daughter Ellen who had married Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester. Their daughter Margaret (d.1280) married William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby and in 1290 their son &quot;the late Sir William de Ferrers, Knt.,&quot; (d.1287) was on record as holding them.

An early member of the Lauder family, Sir Robert de Lawedre of The Bass (c1275 – September 1337) was Justiciar of Lothian as early as 1316. He received a charter dated 4 March 1316, from John Graham of Abercorn, of his lands of Dalcoif, parish of Merton, Berwickshire. The superiority of this property remained in that family for centuries. In 1683 Christina Home, the granddaughter of the last Robert Lauder of that Ilk (d. before July 1655) was retoured heir to it.

The same Robert de Lawedre was one of the witnesses to two charters of confirmation to Jedburgh Abbey on 20 December 1316, signed at Berwick-upon-Tweed. A document written in French, and dated 4 September 1319, entitled: &quot;Lettre d&#x27;attorne pur doner seysine,&quot; and is granted to &quot;Robert de Lawedir Justice de Lounes, [Lothians]...Donez a la langley en la terre de Meuros [Melrose] le quartior de Septembre en lan de grace MCCC et disneifme.&quot;

Above the burgh of Lauder, abutting Lauder Moor and the boundaries of Wedale and the lands of Ladypart, were the lands of Alanshaws, granted to the monks of Melrose by Alan of Galloway, the Constable of Scotland. By 1500 these too were in the hands of the Lauders, probably by feu. The superiority of Ladypart remained in the hands of the Lauder of Bass family until the 17th century, reconfirmed to Robert Lauder of The Bass (d. 1576).

This family erected a Scottish tower house, &quot;the beginning of authentic history as far as the town is concerned,&quot; around which the present town grew, and &quot;Alan Lawedir of the Tower of Lawedir&quot; is mentioned in 1445. Lauder Tower stood in what in 1903 was known as Tower Yard, a garden area then bounded by the Free Kirk Manse and the County Police Station, close by the Easter Port. The road west from the town crossed the Midrow and passed Tower Yard, then passed by Lauder Mill. A continuation of the road went onwards to Chester Hill. It was not taken down until 1700. In 1837 &quot;the new United Presbyterian manse was built on a site which was purchased, for £115, from Baillie [George] Lauder.&quot;
Notable buildings in the town today include the former tolbooth, Lauder Town Hall, which predates 1598 when records show it being burnt by a party of Homes and Cranstouns led by Lord Home who killed a prisoner William Lawther.

The last of the ancient proprietors, Robert Lauder of that Ilk (d.c1655), bequeathed the tower house and other lands to his daughter Isobel, who had married Alexander Home of St. Leonards, in Lauderdale, both dead by November 1683, the major part of the inheritance sold. The old family is today represented by Sir Piers Dick-Lauder, 13th Baronet.

==Thirlestane Castle==

Below the town, on Castle Hill, stood the Crown Fort, a scene of many skirmishes over the years. It is shown on Timothy Pont&#x27;s map. Early records give de Morville a castle at Lauder, but it would appear that there was a new erection of it by the English in the reign of King Edward I. James III and James IV both used the castle. In 1548 the fort was occupied and strengthened by Somerset, the Protector, and garrisoned by Sir Hugh Willoughby &#x27;in the end of winter and beginning of spring&#x27;. After a minor siege with French cannon, it was evacuated on 22 March 1550. The following year John Haitlie in Fawns and William Haitlie in Redpath (near Earlston) were arrested for &quot;treasonably supplying the English in the Castle of Lauder, thereby enabling them to hold out longer.&quot; The Crown which had in any case abandoned the fort during its occupation, had given it to Robert Lauder of that Ilk (d. bef July 1567), who provided it, in 1532, to his daughter Alison as dowry when she married. Following she and her husband&#x27;s deaths in feuds in 1547 it reverted to Robert Lauder whose wife was Alison Cranstoun. A Cranstoun relation later sold it on to Chancellor John Maitland in 1587. He commenced the building of the magnificent Thirlestane Castle upon that site two years later, parts of the original walls of the ancient fort being included in the walls of the new edifice. In 1670-7 Sir William Bruce, known as a &#x27;gentleman architect&#x27;, supervised its transformation into a palace through remodelling for the Duke of Lauderdale.

By the 18th century the Maitlands had supplanted the ancient Lauders as the pre-eminent local family, and had managed to acquire most of the properties which had belonged to the ancient family, although Windpark/Wyndepark (which overlooked Thirlestane Castle) and its Pele Tower remained in the hands of John Lauder of Winepark and Carolside (near Earlston), until about 1750.

==Church==

Near to the old Crown Fort stood the ancient parish church of St. Mary (a dependency of Dryburgh Abbey). In a Writ of c1217 an &quot;Everardus&quot; is recorded as pastor of Laweder, and in 1245 there was a Chapter of the Clergy of East Lothian at Lauder on Saturday after the Feast of Saint Peter, &quot;ad vincula&quot;, when a dispute was settled between the Priory of St. Andrews and the nuns of Haddington, regarding the tithes of Stevenstoun, nr. Haddington. In this original church many of the old Lauder family were interred, including two bishops, William de Lawedre, Bishop of Glasgow and Lord Chancellor of Scotland, and Alexander Lauder, Bishop of Dunkeld. It was from this church, in 1482, that James III&#x27;s favourites, including the architect Robert Cochrane, and his tailor James Homyll, were dragged by envious nobles led by Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus and hanged from the (earlier) Lauder Bridge. The sites of the ancient kirk and the bridge from which Cochrane and his colleagues met their demise, are now within the immediate policies of Thirlestane Castle, the church some 60 yards from the west front, and the bridge some quarter-mile to the north-east.

With their local ascendancy, and with Thirlestane Castle becoming even grander, John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale decided he would demolish the ancient kirk, and had a new church erected by Sir William Bruce in 1673 in the centre of the Royal Burgh. Around it is a walled graveyard, with a watchhouse built after a bodysnatching raid in 1830.

There was also (now demolished) a large United Presbyterian Church at the West Port. The manse still stands, but is now a private residence.

==Today==
In 2015 Lauder&#x27;s population was estimated by the National Records of Scotland as 1,803.

Lauder is today strongly influenced by its proximity to Edinburgh as it is now considered to be close enough for people to commute into the capital for work. The bus service to Edinburgh is reliable but infrequent, with 8 buses daily.

Recent developments in Lauder include the construction of a new primary school, a new health centre, and the expansion of the nearby Dun Law wind farm.

The council is based at Kilmory Castle, around which is located a woodland park and an Iron Age fort. Forestry and Land Scotland also have an office there.


==History==
As a planned settlement, Lochgilphead was created in 1790, shortly after the completion of a road from Inveraray to Campbeltown. After the completion of the Crinan Canal in 1801, the town became more important as a link across the Kintyre peninsula. When a road was completed in 1830, Lochgilphead was linked to Oban. In 1831 a pier was built, promoting maritime transit between Lochgilphead and Glasgow, and other ports along the Irish Sea.
In 1975 Lochgilphead was chosen as the administrative headquarters of the Argyll and Bute District Council as part of local government reorganisation, due to its central location.

There are a large number of Neolithic remains, including cup and ring marks in the nearby Kilmartin Glen, and Dunadd Hillfort (capital of the Kingdom of Dál Riata) is also close.

<text>Nairn (; ) is a town and former royal burgh in the Highland Council area of Scotland. It is an ancient fishing port and market town around east of Inverness, at the point where the River Nairn enters the Moray Firth. It is the traditional county town of Nairnshire.

At the 2022 census, Nairn had a population of 9,394, making it the third-largest settlement in the Highland Council area, behind Inverness and Fort William. Nairn is best known as a seaside resort, with two golf courses, beaches, a community centre and arts venue, a small theatre (called The Little Theatre) and one small museum, providing information on the local area and incorporating the collection of the former Fishertown museum.
==History==

The History of Nairn is a broad and diverse topic spanning its Palaeolithic and Mesolithic roots before recorded history, to the Picts and the visitation of Roman general Agricola. Its possible founding under the name Ekkailsbakki by Sigurd, Earl of Orkney, its royal burgh status under David I, its strong links to monarchs and regents of Scotland and its strategic position in multiple wars and famine.

==Geography==
Formerly part of the Supercontinent of Rodinia as evidenced by the discovery of Dalradian Supergroup rocks, Nairn encompasses a 2.6 mile by 1.5 mile position on the mouth of the River Nairn and is fronted by the North Sea at the Moray Firth with two extensive beaches. The east beach being predominantly sand with dune vegetation (such as marram grass) and the west having more rock though becoming more sand as it reaches the river mouth. The Culbin Sands forms part of one of the most extensive areas of stabilised blown sand in Britain. The soil by the coast is largely a thin and loose organic layer developing directly on the sand and this has been strengthened in areas such as Culbin for forestry.

The town itself is predominantly flat rising from sea level to 40 ft in Fishertown and the majority of the town sitting at 65 ft above sea level. Sections of Nairn do reach as high as 95 ft near Balblair. The low ground near the coast is fertile and the soil rich free loam over sand or gravel. In the town thin, rather acidic soils are present throughout. The alluvial plain has shown Permo-Triassic sandstones, thick accumulations of Jurassic sandstones and dark shales, and erosion by ice sheets. Excavation can reveal dark, muddy glacial deposits, with occasional fossils and shells. 

As the land rises south we see Conifer forests and on the higher slopes we see heather moorland and montane vegetation. The wider Nairnshire and Moray area is 28% woodland, one of the most-wooded areas in Britain.

Nairn is predominantly surrounded gently rolling mounds and hills of mixed-used agricultural and forestry usage upon a glacial landscape. The surrounding areas reaching a height of 620 ft at the Hill of Urchany 3.7 mils south of the town. The land remains fertile and primarily consisting of granite below. The Hydrology of the surrounding area directs water to drain northwards into the River Nairn leaving it prone to flooding. As such the embankments are strengthened in inhabited areas.

==Population==


==Culture==
On 27 May 1960 Nairn&#x27;s The Regal Ballroom on Leopold Street played host to an act that would go on to become a huge cultural influence on the world of music. A cover band touring Scotland on The Beat Ballad Show Tour with Johnny Gentle as the lead vocalists and featuring three relatively unknown musicians. The founding members of The Beatles. John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison played under the name The Silver Beetles. The cover act&#x27;s set list included &quot;Raining in My Heart&quot; by Buddy Holly and &quot;I Need Your Love Tonight&quot; by Elvis Presley. The prominent Ballerina Ballroom of Nairn played host to many famous acts over the years including Pink Floyd and The Who in 1967, Status Quo in 1970, Fleetwood Mac and Slade in 1971. The town continues to hold a musical heart hosting the Nairn International Jazz Festival each August, usually attracting some well-known musicians including Bob Wilber and the Soprano Summit Jazz supergroup.

One link to Nairn&#x27;s agricultural cultural roots is the Nairn Farmer&#x27;s Show, better known locally as just the Nairn Show is hosted by the Nairnshire Farming Society as it has been since 1798. The show features livestock competitions of cattle, sheep and horses with trade stands as well as craft and food fairs. Locals produce baked goods, honey, jams and handicrafts such as knitting to be pitted against each other in contest. Many of the people of Nairn have a passion for cooking and this passion is shown in the three day long Taste of Nairn food and drink festival event hosting the World Tattie Scone Championship.

Nairn is home to the Little Theatre, run by the Nairn Drama Club, which was established in 1946. Each year the club produces a number of shows, of varying genres, with the annual Christmas panto being the largest production of all. The Theatre began in dilapidated premises but was rebuilt and reopened in 2004.In 2007 Oscar-winning actress Tilda Swinton, who lives in Nairn, created a film festival entitled &quot;Ballerina Ballroom Cinema of Dreams&quot;, which was held in the Nairn Public Hall. It generated worldwide press about the festival and Nairn.

The people of Nairn also appreciate the written arts and is the host for the annual Nairn Book &amp; Arts festival which takes place every year in September at the Nairn Community &amp; Arts Centre. Guests have included authors such as Helen Sedgwick, journalist John Sergeant and royalty guest Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The events have included speakers, performers, cinema and readings of local poet Olive Fraser.

==Education==
Nairn is currently serviced by one secondary school named Nairn Academy located on Duncan Drive in the Tradespark area of Nairn where it has existed since 1976. Prior to this located in the building occupied by the current Rosebank Primary school on Lodgehill Rd. Nairn Academy was founded in 1832 under the name Rose&#x27;s Academical Institution by Captain James Rose. Prior to Nairn academy other facilities had existed including the preparatory boarding school for boys known under the names Seaforth in 1901 and Alton Burn in 1911. As well as Rosebank Primary school, Nairn is also the location of Millbank Primary school on Millbank Crescent. Nairn Academy also commonly takes students from Cawdor, Croy and Auldearn Primary Schools.

In 1818 we are offered insight into the status of the school facilities by the parish minister.

In 2021 Nairn Academy has been ranked as 204 out of 340 schools based on the percentage of pupils attaining five Highers at 35%. Higher than nearby Inverness High School with 13% and below Inverness Royal Academy with 41% and Charleston Academy Highland with 45%.

==Politics==
===Member of UK Parliament (MP)===
In 1617 Nairn selected John Dunbar of Moynes as the Member of Parliament in the Parliament of Scotland for the constituency Nairnshire. This constituency was last represented by John Forbes of Culloden in 1707.

In 1708 following the Acts of Union, 1707, Parliament of Scotland constituency Nairnshire was replaced by a district of burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. From 1708 to 1918 Nairn was part of the county constituency of Inverness-shire.

The constituency was abolished in 1918 and the Forres and Nairn components were merged into the then new constituency of Moray and Nairn. Moray and Nairn was a county constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1918 to 1983. This was split for the 1983 general election and incorporated into Moray and Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber.

Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber was a county constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1983 to 1997. Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber, was a county constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2005 represented by Labour&#x27;s David Stewart.

Nairn was part of the constituency of 
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey from 2005 to 2024, represented first by Danny Alexander (Lib Dem) and then Drew Hendry (SNP).

Nairn is currently residing in the Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey constituency of the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. Nairn has been represented by SNP MP Graham Leadbitter in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom since 4 July 2024.

===Member of Scottish Parliament (MSP)===
Founded under the Scotland Act 1998, a devolved Scottish Parliament was legalised placing Nairn into the Scottish Parliament in 1999 as part of the Highland council area and constituency Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber. Fergus Ewing of the Scottish National Party was elected to represent Nairn in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election as the first Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP).

Boundaries were redrawn before the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, dividing the area between Inverness and Nairn and Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch. Fergus Ewing was once again elected in the 2011 election and continues to serve.

===Local Government===
Nairn is part of in ward 18, Nairn &amp; Cawdor, of the Highland Council area. The head of this burgh or ward council is a provost, the chief magistrate or convener of a burgh, the equivalent of a mayor in other parts of the United Kingdom. The provost of Nairn is Laurie Fraser.

Formed in 1973 the community council is the lowest tier of local government in Scotland. Nairn District Council, was replaced by a larger authority, Highland Council in 1996 and community councils were formed to represent local interests. Nairn is represented by two local community councils. The Nairn West &amp; Suburban Community Council and the Nairn River Community Council.

==Religion==
During the 2011 census, the majority of responses from Nairn indicated a religious association with the largest group belonging to the Church of Scotland although this group was smaller than those who indicated that they did not follow any religion.

===Christianity===

Nairn was included traditionally within the diocese of Moray believed to be formed in the reign of Alexander I of Scotland around 1122 which extended from Spey to the River Beauly. A writ in the time of William the Lion shows Bishop of Nairn had given possession of lands in Nairn to King William for the building of Nairn Castle. Implying much of the land of Nairn and the castle had previously belonged to the church or to the Bishop of Moray himself. Possession of Auldearn was provided in compensation.

There are two Church of Scotland congregations in the town. The Old Parish Church, commonly known as Nairn Old Parish Church, is on Academy Street in Nairn erected in 1811, and containing 902 sittings.

A second working building is on the High Street. Nairn St Ninians was opened in 1881 as a Free Church of Scotland and is of an Early French Gothic design, costing £7000 and containing 1200 sittings. In 1900 The Free Church and The United Presbyterian Church united, when it became Nairn High Church. In 1974 The High Church united with The Rosebank Church, and the new congregation appropriately took the name St. Ninian&#x27;s, the Patron Saint of the Burgh and one pre-eminent in bringing the Gospel to the people of Scotland. This parish extends across most of the town and out towards Auldearn.

St Columba&#x27;s Episcopal Church is on Queen Street; the church was built of sandstone with a slate roof in 1857 and is still in use. There is also St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Academy Street, founded as a result of Gaelic-speaking Roman Catholics who moved from the island of Barra to Nairn in the second half of the 19th. century.

Other worshipping communities include Nairn Baptist Church, Nairn Free Church, and The Pentecostal Church of God.

===Islam===
Islamic practice within the area can be traced back to before World War Two with nine Muslim graves for the fallen veterans in nearby Kingussie. Lady Zainab, also known as Lady Evelyn Cobbold and Zainab Cobbold is another local figure of note and daughter of the 7th Earl of Dunmore. Born in 1867 she is the first known British woman to complete the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1932 and continued to practice her faith until her death in Inverness in 1963.

The number of Muslims noted in the 2011 Census of Scotland is reflective of the lack of Mosque in the town of Nairn. The nearest Mosque being Inverness Mosque, 16 miles west and the next Elgin Mosque 21miles east. In the north of Scotland prayers times can start as early as 2am for Fajr and as 11am for Isha.

===Paganism===

Paganism, Wicca, or Witchcraft has a long history in Scotland and in Nairn. In nearby Elgin, east of the cathedral exists the Order Pot, a deep pool of water used to test the witches of Nairn up to 1560. Over fifty people were tried and killed within two miles of Nairn including Issobel Nicoll, Margaret Wilsone and Allexander Ledy in the 16th and 17th century as witches and warlocks.

In 1662 a woman living in nearby Auldearn just two miles from Nairn named Isobel Gowdie was accused and confessed to four counts of Witchcraft and is immortalised in &quot;The Confession of Isobel Gowdie&quot;, an orchestra piece by composer James MacMillan.

Practices continued into 1848, as a corps creagh was discovered on the bank of the River Nairn near the town itself. A life-sized clay figure filled with needles, placed in such a way that water dipped over its heart. It was said that on the clay dissolving, the man the clay represented would die.

Modern day pagans have formed online groups such as the Scottish Pagan Federation, Highland Pagan Open Circle and East Scotland Heathen Moot which hold Nairnshire residents within their members.

<text>North Berwick (; ) is a seaside town and former royal burgh in East Lothian, Scotland. It is situated on the south shore of the Firth of Forth, approximately east-northeast of Edinburgh. North Berwick became a fashionable holiday resort in the nineteenth century because of its two sandy bays, the East (or Milsey) Bay and the West Bay, and continues to attract holidaymakers. Golf courses at the ends of each bay are open to visitors.

== Name ==
The name Berwick means &quot;barley farmstead&quot; (&quot;bere&quot; in Old English means &quot;barley&quot; and &quot;wic&quot; means &quot;farmstead&quot;). Alternatively, like other place names in Scotland ending in &#x27;wick&#x27;, this word means &#x27;bay&#x27; (Old Norse: vík). The word North was applied to distinguish this Berwick from Berwick-upon-Tweed, which throughout the Middle Ages the Scots called South Berwick. It was recorded as Northberwyk in 1250. 

== Prehistory and Archaeology ==
On the south side of North Berwick Law there is evidence of at least 18 hut circles, rich middens and a field system dating from 2,000 years ago. There have been numerous archaeological excavations in the town that have uncovered evidence of North Berwick&#x27;s medieval and modern remains. One such excavation found evidence of pre-medieval occupation of the area in the form of several Iron Age Cist burials.

One of the largest excavations occurred when many of the water mains in the town were replaced in the 2000s and archaeologists monitored the work. These excavations found the first evidence of the city walls - all towns of Scotland on the east coast were required by an Act of Parliament (1503) to build walls, but until then there was no evidence that they were ever built. It also found that the High Street was the main street in the medieval burgh, rather than Quality Street that had been hypothesized.

== History ==
=== Medieval ===
Excavations have shown that from as early as the eighth century, a ferry crossing to Earlsferry, near Elie in Fife was in existence, serving pilgrims on their way to the shrine of Saint Andrew. North Berwick Harbour was built in the twelfth century to meet the demands made of the existing ferry trade. This ferry was recently reinstated; during the summer, a boat travels between North Berwick and Anstruther in Fife, in homage to the original ferry.

Around 1150, Duncan, Earl of Fife of the Clan MacDuff founded an influential Cistercian nunnery (whose power continued until the Scottish Reformation, and its dissolution in 1588). Duncan&#x27;s family shortly afterwards, at the start of the thirteenth century built North Berwick Castle erecting a wooden motte and bailey on the site of what is now Castle Hill in the east end of the town, at the start of Tantallon Terrace. This castle was attacked and held by the Earl of Pembroke around 1306; the English abandoned it by 1314, during the aftermath of the Battle of Bannockburn. Late in the fourteenth century the Lauder family (owners of the Bass Rock castle) erected a stone tower with a barmkin on the site; however they had abandoned it by 1420 in favour of the Bass, possibly as a result of conflict with the owners of nearby Tantallon Castle.

In the fourteenth century the town became a baronial burgh under William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, who then built nearby Tantallon Castle to consolidate his power.

=== Post Medieval ===
Later, during the fifteenth century, the town became a royal burgh in the reign of James I of Scotland.

The &quot;Auld Kirk Green&quot; at the harbour was allegedly used for gatherings by the accused in the North Berwick Witch Trials (1590–92). Legend has it that Satan himself attended a ritual there in 1590. During the sixteenth century at least 70 people were implicated in the Witch Trials, and the events inspired works such as Burns&#x27; &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot; and &quot;The Thirteenth Member&quot; by Mollie Hunter. One of the most famous witch trials at North Berwick was that of Agnes Sampson. She was accused of making a potion to create rough storms in the North Sea as King James VI was sailing home from Denmark with his new wife, Anne of Denmark. The trial took place in 1591, attended by King James. Agnes Sampson was tortured to confess, and then burnt at the stake, like many other innocent people.

===Whaling in the eighteenth century===

Local lore, place names, and the jawbone arch first erected atop the Law in 1709, suggest that the port was involved in the whaling industry, though there is little written evidence to prove it. If so, it would have been a minor participant in the industry, overshadowed by nearby Leith. Certainly, whales have washed ashore at North Berwick over the years, even in recent times. The North Berwick Town House was erected in the High Street in 1724.

=== Industrial and Modern ===
Despite the railway arriving in 1850, the Industrial Revolution bypassed the town. The late-nineteenth century saw North Berwick develop golfing and holiday facilities. The town soon became popular as a home for Edinburgh commuters and retirees.

The size and population of the town remained fairly steady until the 1970s, at which point housebuilding began in earnest around the periphery of the town, first to the south (1950s–70s), then in a series of major expansions to the west (1980s-present) along the line of the railway. There is talk of further developments focussing on &quot;affordable housing&quot;, on the south side of the town. While the population has grown significantly but not truly &quot;exploded&quot;, house prices have rocketed since the 1950s. North Berwick consistently appears at the top of national house price surveys, and like-for-like prices are comparable to Edinburgh. North Berwick was listed as the most expensive seaside town in Scotland in 2006, and was second to St. Andrews in 2009. In 2021, it was voted best place to live in Scotland.

==Islands==
Several of the Islands of the Forth are near the town and visible from it: e.g. Fidra, Lamb, Craigleith, and the Bass Rock; the last-named hosts a thriving colony of seabirds, including puffins and gannets. The Bass Rock appears white due to the white plumage of seabirds, and their white guano, which cover much of its surface. The seabirds can be observed at close range through remote cameras operated from the Scottish Seabird Centre near the harbour.

== Attractions ==

* Boat trips to the Bass Rock, Fidra and other islands, although landings are restricted and depend on sea conditions.
* Scottish Seabird Centre – Visitor centre about seabirds found on Bass Rock and elsewhere.
* North Berwick Law – A volcanic hill that rises above the town, with a ruined Napoleonic era signal station just below its summit. The arch at the summit, formed by a whale&#x27;s jawbone, collapsed in June 2005. It was replaced by a fibreglass replica in June 2008.
* Beaches – One of North Berwick&#x27;s main attractions, the beaches, have golden sands and igneous rocks sculpted into interesting shapes by the sea. The East Sands have a tide-filled boating pond/paddling pool.
* Seacliff. An entry fee is charged at this private and largely unspoilt beach and estate, just east of the town.
* Golf – There are two golf courses in the town, the West Links and the Glen, or East Links, and several others along the East Lothian coast. There are also two 18-hole putting greens, and a Golfing Heritage Trail through the town.
* Tennis – The tennis courts at the Glen host the annual East Lothian Open Tennis Tournament.
* The East Lothian Yacht Club hosts many national and international sailing events.
* The John Muir Way, the East Lothian coastal path, passes through the town.
* Tantallon Castle is an imposing if mostly ruined 14th-century fortress in the care of Historic Scotland, located east of North Berwick.

==Governance==
Douglas Alexander of the Labour and Co-Operative Party was elected MP in the 2024 General Election. Kenny MacAskill of the Alba Party served as the Member of Parliament for East Lothian from 2019 until 2024. Former East Lothian Council leader Paul McLennan of the Scottish National Party (SNP) has served as the MSP for East Lothian since 2021. There are three councillors for North Berwick Coastal.

==Churches==

There are several churches in the town. These include:

===Church of Scotland===
*Abbey Church
*Parish Kirk
*St Andrew Blackadder Church
*St Andrew&#x27;s Old

===Roman Catholic===
*Our Lady, Star of the Sea

===Other churches===

== Transport ==
The town is served by North Berwick railway station. The North Berwick Line has provided a rail link with Edinburgh since 17 June 1850 and the line, now operated by ScotRail, is still the principal transit link between the town and the capital. The service takes 33 minutes and runs hourly with extra trains during peak commuting periods and on Saturdays. Combination rail-and-entry tickets for the Scottish Seabird Centre are available. There is an occasional service through to Glasgow Central station on weekdays, although anyone heading for central Glasgow is advised to switch to the Edinburgh – Glasgow Queen St. service. There is a regular bus service (nos 124 and X24) between the town and Edinburgh city centre. Edinburgh Airport is the nearest airport, not just to North Berwick but the whole county, and is approximately a 45-minute drive away, or around 1 hour 20 mins by public transport.

East Coast Buses, a subsidiary company run by Lothian Buses, runs a twice-hourly service between Edinburgh (Semple Street) to North Berwick Tesco via Portobello, Musselburgh, Prestonpans, Longniddry, Aberlady, Gullane and Dirleton. The bus in North Berwick runs on a loop from the High Street (Church Street bus stop) to the Tesco Terminus and back, then returns to Edinburgh. There are also local services to Haddington, Dunbar and attractions such as the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune.

==Literary links==
Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894) spent many holidays in the town during his childhood and as a young man. His father, Thomas Stevenson the engineer and lighthouse builder, took his family to stay in various locations in the town. The island of Fidra is said to be the original inspiration for &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, and much of his novel &quot;Catriona&quot; (the sequel to &quot;Kidnapped&quot;) is set locally.

The Scottish author William Dalrymple (born 1965), whose work primarily focuses on British India, has roots in the town, with his family having once owned much of the area. William&#x27;s father Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple is the current and 10th Baronet of North Berwick. William is the youngest of four brothers.

<doc id="393115" wikidata="Q11704319" url="?curid=393115" title="Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Chern theorem (or the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem after Shiing-Shen Chern, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and Pierre Ossian Bonnet) states that the Euler–Poincaré characteristic (a topological invariant defined as the alternating sum of the Betti numbers of a topological space) of a closed even-dimensional Riemannian manifold is equal to the integral of a certain polynomial (the Euler class) of its curvature form (an analytical invariant).

It is a highly non-trivial generalization of the classic Gauss–Bonnet theorem (for 2-dimensional manifolds / surfaces) to higher even-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. In 1943, Carl B. Allendoerfer and André Weil proved a special case for extrinsic manifolds. In a classic paper published in 1944, Shiing-Shen Chern proved the theorem in full generality connecting global topology with local geometry.

The Riemann–Roch theorem and the Atiyah–Singer index theorem are other generalizations of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.

== Statement ==
One useful form of the Chern theorem is that

: formula_1

where formula_2 denotes the Euler characteristic of &quot;formula_3.&quot; The Euler class is defined as

: formula_4

where we have the Pfaffian formula_5. Here &quot;formula_3&quot; is a compact orientable 2&quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary, and formula_7 is the associated curvature form of the Levi-Civita connection. In fact, the statement holds with formula_7 the curvature form of any metric connection on the tangent bundle, as well as for other vector bundles over formula_3.

Since the dimension is 2&quot;n&quot;, we have that formula_7 is an formula_11-valued 2-differential form on &quot;formula_3&quot; (see special orthogonal group). So formula_7 can be regarded as a skew-symmetric 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; matrix whose entries are 2-forms, so it is a matrix over the commutative ring formula_14. Hence the Pfaffian is a 2&quot;n&quot;-form. It is also an invariant polynomial.

However, Chern&#x27;s theorem in general is that for any closed formula_15 orientable &quot;n&quot;-dimensional &quot;formula_3&quot;,

: formula_17

where the above pairing (,) denotes the cap product with the Euler class of the tangent bundle formula_18.

=== Proofs ===

In 1944, the general theorem was first proved by S. S. Chern in a classic paper published by the Princeton University math department.

In 2013, a proof of the theorem via supersymmetric Euclidean field theories was also found.

== Applications ==
The Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem can be seen as a special instance in the theory of characteristic classes. The Chern integrand is the Euler class. Since it is a top-dimensional differential form, it is closed. The naturality of the Euler class means that when changing the Riemannian metric, one stays in the same cohomology class. That means that the integral of the Euler class remains constant as the metric is varied and is thus a global invariant of the smooth structure.

The theorem has also found numerous applications in physics, including:

* adiabatic phase or Berry&#x27;s phase, 
* string theory, 
* condensed matter physics,
* topological quantum field theory,
* topological phases of matter (see the 2016 Nobel Prize in physics by Duncan Haldane et al.).

== Special cases ==

===Four-dimensional manifolds===
In dimension formula_19, for a compact oriented manifold, we get

:formula_20

where formula_21 is the full Riemann curvature tensor, formula_22 is the Ricci curvature tensor, and formula_23 is the scalar curvature. This is particularly important in general relativity, where spacetime is viewed as a 4-dimensional manifold. 

In terms of the orthogonal Ricci decomposition of the Riemann curvature tensor, this formula can also be written as

:formula_24

where formula_25 is the Weyl tensor and formula_26 is the traceless Ricci tensor.

===Even-dimensional hypersurfaces===
For a compact, even-dimensional hypersurface formula_3 in formula_28 we get

:formula_29
where formula_30 is the volume element of the hypersurface, formula_31 is the Jacobian determinant of the Gauss map, and formula_32 is the surface area of the unit n-sphere.

=== Gauss–Bonnet theorem ===

The Gauss–Bonnet theorem is a special case when formula_3 is a 2-dimensional manifold. It arises as the special case where the topological index is defined in terms of Betti numbers and the analytical index is defined in terms of the Gauss–Bonnet integrand.

As with the two-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet theorem, there are generalizations when formula_3 is a manifold with boundary.

==Further generalizations==

=== Atiyah–Singer ===

A far-reaching generalization of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem is the Atiyah–Singer Index Theorem.

Let formula_35 be a weakly elliptic differential operator between vector bundles. That means that the principal symbol is an isomorphism. Strong ellipticity would furthermore require the symbol to be positive-definite.

Let formula_36 be its adjoint operator. Then the analytical index is defined as

: formula_37

By ellipticity this is always finite. The index theorem says that this is constant as the elliptic operator is varied smoothly. It is equal to a topological index, which can be expressed in terms of characteristic classes like the Euler class.

The Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem is derived by considering the Dirac operator

: formula_38

=== Odd dimensions ===
The Chern formula is only defined for even dimensions because the Euler characteristic vanishes for odd dimensions. There is some research being done on &#x27;twisting&#x27; the index theorem in K-theory to give non-trivial results for odd dimensions.

There is also a version of Chern&#x27;s formula for orbifolds.

== History ==
Shiing-Shen Chern published his proof of the theorem in 1944 while at the Institute for Advanced Study. This was historically the first time that the formula was proven without assuming the manifold to be embedded in a Euclidean space, which is what it means by &quot;intrinsic&quot;. The special case for a hypersurface (an (n-1)-dimensional submanifold in an n-dimensional Euclidean space) was proved by H. Hopf in which the integrand is the Gauss–Kronecker curvature (the product of all principal curvatures at a point of the hypersurface). This was generalized independently by Allendoerfer in 1939 and Fenchel in 1940 to a Riemannian submanifold of a Euclidean space of any codimension, for which they used the Lipschitz–Killing curvature (the average of the Gauss–Kronecker curvature along each unit normal vector over the unit sphere in the normal space; for an even dimensional submanifold, this is an invariant only depending on the Riemann metric of the submanifold). Their result would be valid for the general case if the Nash embedding theorem can be assumed. However, this theorem was not available then, as John Nash published his famous embedding theorem for Riemannian manifolds in 1956. In 1943 Allendoerfer and Weil published their proof for the general case, in which they first used an approximation theorem of H. Whitney to reduce the case to analytic Riemannian manifolds, then they embedded &quot;small&quot; neighborhoods of the manifold isometrically into a Euclidean space with the help of the Cartan–Janet local embedding theorem, so that they can patch these embedded neighborhoods together and apply the above theorem of Allendoerfer and Fenchel to establish the global result. This is, of course, unsatisfactory for the reason that the theorem only involves intrinsic invariants of the manifold, then the validity of the theorem should not rely on its embedding into a Euclidean space. Weil met Chern in Princeton after Chern arrived in August 1943. He told Chern that he believed there should be an intrinsic proof, which Chern was able to obtain within two weeks. The result is Chern&#x27;s classic paper &quot;A simple intrinsic proof of the Gauss–Bonnet formula for closed Riemannian manifolds&quot; published in the Annals of Mathematics the next year. The earlier work of Allendoerfer, Fenchel, Allendoerfer and Weil were cited by Chern in this paper. The work of Allendoerfer and Weil was also cited by Chern in his second paper related to the same topic.

<text>Peebles () is a town in the Scottish Borders, Scotland. It was historically a royal burgh and the county town of Peeblesshire. According to the 2011 census, the population was 8,376 and the estimated population in June 2018 was 9,000.

==History==
Initially, a market town, Peebles played a role in the woollen industry of the Borders during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Most mills had closed by the 1960s, although the last one remained open until 2015. The character of Peebles has changed; the town serves as home to many people who commute to work in Edinburgh, as well as being a popular tourist destination, especially in the summer. In the mid-to-late 19th century health tourism flourished, centring on hydropathic establishments, which over time morphed into a hotel format, with Peebles Hydro Hotel being one of the few survivors of that era. Notable buildings in the town include the Old Parish Church of Peebles and Neidpath Castle. Other local attractions include a museum and the Kailzie Gardens. Peebles has won multiple awards for the range of shops on its High Street.

=== Historic features and traditions ===

The oldest building in Peebles is the tower of St Andrew&#x27;s Church. The church was founded in 1195. It was destroyed (along with many other Borders abbeys and priories) by the soldiers of Henry VIII. The stones of the ruins were pilfered for many other local buildings leaving only the tower standing amongst the gravestones of the churchyard. Another ancient church in the town is the Cross Kirk, founded in 1261. Although now mainly ruins, the Cross Kirk plays a prominent part in the local festival.

The annual local festival in Peebles is called the Beltane, and involves (as with many Borders festivals) a Common Riding. The Beltane, proclaimed at the cross, culminates with the crowning of the Beltane Queen (a girl chosen from one of three local primary schools) along with her court, including the likes of the First and Second Courtiers, Sword Bearer and Standard Bearer; on the steps in front of the parish church. The adult principal of the festival is the Cornet, a local young man chosen by the organizing committee on a basis of being considered worthy of representing the town, who then carries the town standard for a year.

To the west of the town is Neidpath Castle, which can be reached on foot through Hay Lodge Park; the route has views of the castle. The castle is now closed to the public.

On the south side of the High Street are the old burgh offices. These incorporate the town&#x27;s library, art gallery, and local museum. The building occupied by these is called the Chambers Institution, being deeded to the town by William Chambers, a member of the Chambers publishing family who originated in the town. Chambers&#x27; house can be found on the oldest street in Peebles – Biggiesknowe. Peebles tolbooth, the civic centre of the medieval burgh, is the only medieval tolbooth site in Scotland to have been excavated by archaeologists.

Peebles is no longer connected to the railway network. In years past, the Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway had lines that connected Peebles to Edinburgh and Galashiels, with a goods station and Peebles and Peebles West stations. A connection to Edinburgh is maintained by Borders Buses service X62.

Historically Peebles and the Scottish borders have been the location of many textile businesses. Still today, March Street Mills is the location of Robert Noble along with its sister company Replin Fabrics.

=== Coat of arms ===
The arms of the Royal Burgh of Peebles feature three salmon on a red field. The heraldic blazon is: &quot;Gules, three salmons counter-naiant in pale proper&quot;. The motto is &quot;Contra Nando Incrementum&quot;, Latin for &quot;There is growth by swimming against the stream&quot;, referring to the annual migration of salmon up the River Tweed in order to breed. The one salmon facing forwards and two facing backwards represent the fact that for every salmon that goes up the river, two come back to the sea.

The arms are very old, first appearing on the town&#x27;s mercat cross, which was built sometime before 1320. Originally the colours were not standardised, the background variously appearing as blue, green or red. The last seems to have been most common, and it was red that was chosen when the arms were formally granted by Lord Lyon in 1894, following a petition from the town clerk, William Buchan, who had previously received a letter from A. C. Fox-Davies questioning the burgh&#x27;s right to use the arms.

After the abolition of the old Scottish burghs in 1975, the arms became redundant. In 1988 they were regranted to the Royal Burgh of Peebles and District Community Council, who continue to use the arms today, with the addition of a community council&#x27;s coronet. The traditional province of Ångermanland in Sweden also has a very similar coat of arms, but with a blue background.

==Location==
Peebles lies at the confluence of the River Tweed and Eddleston Water (locally called &quot;the Cuddy&quot;). The Tweed flows west to east, and the Eddleston flows from the north, turning to flow southwest before the confluence. This south-westerly turn demarcates a raised triangular piece of land, open to the east but contained by the rivers to the south and north. The name is generally accepted to come from the Brythonic &quot;pebyll&quot; tents, signifying a temporary settlement.

From around 1570, the eastern side was defended by a town wall, which ran in an east-facing arc, through which the road to Glentress passed at the East Gate. The road passing through this gate, the Eastgate, is one of four gates in Peebles, the others being Northgate, Bridgegate (where the Eddleston Water was crossed to the north of town), and Ludgate (the western gate of the town), now called Young Street.

At the junction of Eastgate and Northgate roads, where the Eastgate becomes High Street, is an ancient market cross. The present-day market is held in a car park adjacent to the site of the former railway station, at the north and south ends of which are the remains of the town wall.
Peebles High Street runs parallel with the Tweed along the spine of a ridge, at the west end of which is the parish church.

==Facilities==
In 2014 Creative Scotland named Peebles the most creative place of its size in Scotland, presenting the town with a Creative Place Award and £100,000 to enhance arts events, festivals, and arts commissions. Most arts performances take place in the Eastgate Theatre on the High Street which has a year-round programme of music, drama, dance, talks, and classes for children and adults. The town also has four major annual festivals – the Beltane Festival, Peebles Arts Festival, Tweedlove Bike Festival, and Imaginarium.

Peebles is a popular centre for walkers, cyclists, and horse riders. It is the eastern terminus of the John Buchan Way, a walking route which runs between Peebles and Broughton. The Cross Borders Drove Road, an route between Hawick and Little Vantage, also passes through the town.

The town is home to two long-established Scottish senior sporting clubs. Peebles Rovers F.C. provides Peebles with a senior Football team in the East of Scotland Football League, meanwhile Peebles RFC currently represent the town in Scottish National League Division Two in the Scottish Rugby pyramid system.

Peebles has an 18-hole golf course located at the upper end of Kirkland Street. The golf club was formerly owned and run by the local council before being taken over and run by its own members.

Peebles has three primary schools: Kingsland (now relocated to Neidpath Road from its original position on Rosetta Road), Priorsford, and the Roman Catholic Halyrude Primary School (now relocated from Elcho Street to the former Kingsland primary school building on Rosetta road). Peebles also has the largest secondary school in the Borders, Peebles High School, which is attended by pupils from all over Tweeddale.

In 2005, a study by the New Economics Foundation ranked Peebles as the best town in Scotland (second best in the UK, after Hebden Bridge in Yorkshire) for a range of independent shops and &#x27;home town identity&#x27;.

The local health facility is Hay Lodge Hospital in Neidpath Road.

<doc id="393125" wikidata="Q1011665" url="?curid=393125" title="Pitlochry">
<text>Pitlochry (; or ) is a town in the Perth and Kinross council area of Scotland, lying on the River Tummel. It is historically in the county of Perthshire, and has a population of 2,776, according to the 2011 census.

It is largely a Victorian town, which developed into a tourist resort after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited the area in 1842 and bought a highland estate at Balmoral, and the arrival of the railway in 1863. It remains a popular tourist resort today and is particularly known for its Pitlochry Festival Theatre, salmon ladder and as a centre for hillwalking, surrounded by mountains such as Ben Vrackie and Schiehallion. It is popular as a base for coach holidays. The town has retained many stone Victorian buildings, and the high street has an unusual period cast iron canopy over one side.

==History==
Pitlochry today dates largely from Victorian times, although the areas known as Moulin and Port-na-craig are much older. History records that Moulin Kirk was granted by the Earl of Atholl to Dunfermline Abbey in 1180 and Moulin became a burgh of barony in 1511. Port-na-craig was the site of the original ferry over the River Tummel which operated until the suspension footbridge was built in 1913. Building between these two separate communities followed the construction of the military road north in the 18th century which followed the line of the present main street. Moulin contained the parish school which was attended by Alexander MacKenzie (1822–1892), the second Prime Minister of Canada. This schoolhouse &quot;Blairmount&quot; now operates as a luxury holiday rental.

In 1842 Queen Victoria visited Perthshire on one of her grand tours and her favourable opinion of the area caused the town to be more widely noticed. After its railway station was built in 1863, Pitlochry became a favoured destination for tourists.

Robert Louis Stevenson stayed at Fishers Hotel in June 1881 with his wife Fanny and mother. The party then moved to Kinnaird Cottage in nearby Moulin. Here Stevenson worked on &quot;Thrawn Janet&quot; (1881), &quot;The Merry Men&quot; (1882) and &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot; (1884).

In 1947 Pitlochry became a burgh. That year also saw the beginning of construction of a dam as part of the Tummel hydro-electric power scheme. The dam and its fish ladder are a popular tourist attraction today. The damming of the river created an artificial loch, Loch Faskally, but flooded a large area north of the town including the old Recreation Park, which was relocated to its current position. The new burgh council adopted the local public hall as Pitlochry Town Hall shortly after it was formed. 

From the 1960s, Sir Robert Watson-Watt, an inventor of radar, and his wife, Dame Katherine Jane Trefusis Forbes, Director of the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force in World War II, lived at her summer house, &quot;The Observatory&quot;, in Pitlochry. Both are buried in the churchyard of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity at Pitlochry.

Pitlochry Festival Theatre was founded by John Stewart in 1951, originally situated in a tent in the grounds of Knockendarroch House in Lower Oakfield. The tent became semi-permanent and remained there for 30 years until the current building at Port-na-craig opened in 1981.

The town was awarded a Gold Medal in the 2009 Britain in Bloom horticultural contest, and outright winner in the category of &quot;Small Town&quot;.

==Governance==
Pitlochry is part of the Perth and Kinross council area.
The Scottish Parliamentary constituency is Perthshire North, represented by John Swinney of the Scottish National Party. The UK Parliament constituency is Angus and Perthshire Glens. The MP is Dave Doogan, also of the Scottish National Party.

==Demography==
At the 2011 census, Pitlochry had a population of 2,776. In the same census, 29.2% of residents were reported as being 65 years old or older – significantly higher than 16.8% for Scotland as a whole. The median ages for females and males were 51 and 49 respectively, compared to 42 and 40 for the whole of Scotland.

==Economy==

The town has two whisky distilleries. Edradour is the smallest legal distillery in Scotland, and Blair Athol Distillery, which has a popular visitor centre, dates back to 1798. Edradour sits to the east of town at the foot of the Moulin Moor. It is privately owned and produces only 12 casks per week with a production workforce of three men. Relatively unchanged since it started making whisky, it is the last example of a traditional distillery and not currently open to visitors. Blair Athol sits on the main road at the southeast of town and since 1933 has been owned by Bell&#x27;s, now part of the Diageo group.

Pitlochry station is home to Pitlochry Station Bookshop. The bookshop was set up in 2005 and is situated on Platform 1.

The power station&#x27;s dam is known for its 310-metre salmon ladder; fish can be viewed swimming from weir to weir within the ladder, via an underwater viewing station or a video from inside the visitor centre. Over 5,000 salmon pass through annually. The dam and power station were completed in 1951 as the last link in the Tummel hydro-electric power scheme which comprises nine power stations and reservoirs. The new reservoir, which was named Loch Faskally, was built across the River Tummel, flooding a large area upstream.

==Churches==
There are a number of churches in Pitlochry, including the Church of Scotland Parish Church of Pitlochry Church of Scotland on Church Road which was built in 1884. Holy Trinity, an Episcopal Church at the eastern end of Pitlochry, was built in 1858. Pitlochry Baptist Church, built in 1884, is situated at the east end of the main street. There is a Roman Catholic church, St Bride&#x27;s, at Rie-achan near Loch Faskally which was established in 1949 as a temporary facility for workers building the dam and power-station there. However, when the workers moved on the chapel remained and following a fire a new church was built and opened in 1969 and serves the local Catholics and large number of Summer visitors.

==Pitlochry Power Station==

Pitlochry was one of the pioneer schemes for hydro-electricity. The Pitlochry Dam was proposed in 1947 by the newly created Hydro Electric Board. Designs were drawn up by Harold Tarbolton. Tarbolton was responsible for the power station but died soon after, and the scheme was then completed by architect T. H. Eley, being built by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners. As a very early acknowledgement of ecological needs the scheme included the ingenious Pitlochry fish ladder to allow spawning salmon to bypass the dam.

==Transport==
===Road===
The town, which lies north of Perth, has been bypassed by the main A9 Inverness to Perth road since 1981.

===Rail===
Pitlochry railway station is located on the Highland Main Line.

===Walking===
The town lies at the eastern end of the Rob Roy Way, a long distance footpath that runs from Drymen.

==Arts and culture==


In 1951, John Stewart created the Pitlochry Festival Theatre, originally held in a tent. A purpose built structure was created at Portnacraig near the River Tummel designed by Law &amp; Dunbar-Nasmith in 1979 and completed in 1981.

Today it occupies a modern, spacious glass fronted building with open aspects across the river Tummell and Ben Vrackie. The theatre operates a unique repertoire system which means visitors to the area can see a different play every day during their Summer Season Festival. Open all year round.

The Winter Words Festival, first held in 2004, is a 10-day literary festival that takes place every year in early February. Most events take place at the Pitlochry Festival Theatre, which attracts over 40 authors, broadcasters, wordsmiths and personalities.

The sound and light show, The Enchanted Forest, takes place in Pitlochry&#x27;s nearby Faskally Wood every year in October, attracting 70,000 visitors to the town.

Every Monday during the summer, the Vale of Atholl Pipe Band, hosts a traditional evening of music, dancing and song, beginning and ending with a short parade along the high street.

==Climate==
As with the rest of the British Isles, Pitlochry experiences a maritime climate with mild summers and cool winters. The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is Faskally, about north-west of the town centre.
Typically the warmest day of the year will rise to and the coldest night will fall to . Pitlochry is notable for its range in temperature on 9 May 1978. The temperature in the morning was recorded as , rising to in the afternoon, giving a range of . This is one of the biggest daily temperature ranges in the United Kingdom.

==Sport==

Pitlochry is home to the Vale of Atholl Football Club. The &quot;Vale&quot; were founded in 1879 and originally played at the old recreation park now situated at the bottom of Loch Faskally. Relocating along with the pavilion in the 1950s when the dam was built to the current location the Vale were regular competitors in the Scottish Cup in the past having played ties against the likes of Dundee and Hibernian.
The Vale&#x27;s most famous former player is Paul Sturrock, who remains a committed Vale supporter. The Vale&#x27;s only First Division championship victory was in the 1990s but recently tasted Second Division success in 2004/5.

The Atholl Highlanders rugby team, established in 2007, also play at The Recreation Park.

Pitlochry Highland Games has been held annually on the second Saturday of September since 1852 and is the last event in the Scottish Highland Games calendar. In 1852 the original Recreation Park was formed on the north bank of the Tummel at the foot of Rie-Achan Road across what is now known as Lady&#x27;s Dell. However, with the building of the dam, the old park was flooded in 1950 and the Games moved to the new and current Recreation Park. The original pavilion had been dismantled and was re-erected for 1951. It remains unchanged externally today but was upgraded internally in 1964. A feature of the Games is the Pipe Band Championship which attracts a large entry and culminates in the unique Massed Pipe Band parade at the end of the day.

Eve Muirhead, the Olympic curler, played at a club in Pitlochry before the demolition of the curling rink.

<text>&#x27;
Selkirk is a town and historic royal burgh in the Scottish Borders council district of southeastern Scotland. It lies on the Ettrick Water, a tributary of the River Tweed. The people of the town are known as Souters, which means cobblers (shoe makers and menders). At the time of the 2011 census, Selkirk&#x27;s population was 5,784.

==History==
===Early origins===
Selkirk was formerly the county town of Selkirkshire. Selkirk is one of the oldest Royal Burghs in Scotland and is the site of the earliest settlements in what is now the Scottish Borders. The town&#x27;s name means &quot;church by the hall&quot; from the Old English &quot;sele&quot; (&quot;hall&quot; or &quot;manor&quot;) and &quot;cirice&quot; (&quot;church&quot;).

Selkirk was the site of the first Borders abbey, a community of Tironensian monks who moved to Kelso Abbey during the reign of King David I. In 1113, King David I granted Selkirk large amounts of land. William Wallace was declared guardian of Scotland in the town at the Kirk o&#x27; the Forest in 1297.

===War of the Three Kingdoms===

Selkirk sent a contingent of 80 men to fight at the Battle of Flodden in 1513; however, only one man, &quot;Fletcher&quot;, returned from the battle, bearing a blood-stained English flag belonging to the Macclesfield regiment.

During the series of conflicts that would become known as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Selkirk played host to the Royalist army of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, with his cavalry installed in the burgh, whilst the Royalist infantry were camped at the plain of Philiphaugh, below the town. On the morning of 13 September 1645, a covenanting army led by Sir David Leslie attacked the royalist forces camped at Philiphaugh, and a rout ensued. Montrose arrived to find his army in disarray and had to flee the field. The surrendered Royalist troops were subsequently executed.

The novelist, Sir Walter Scott, presided, as the sheriff-depute, in the courtroom at Selkirk Town House in the early 19th century.

===Recent history===

Selkirk grew in the mid-19th century because of its woollen industry, although that industry largely closed in the 1970s. The town is also known for bannocks, a dry fruit cake, which was first sold in the market place by a local baker, Robbie Douglas, in 1859.

==Culture==

===Traditions===
The Selkirk Common Riding is a celebration of the history and traditions of the Royal and Ancient Burgh. It is held on the second Friday after the first Monday in June.

===Landmarks===
The remains of the &quot;forest kirk&quot;, referred to in ancient times as the church of St Mary of the Forest, still stand in the old churchyard. It is also the final resting place of several maternal ancestors of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the US.

Just to the south of the town is The Haining, the late 18th-century residence of the Pringle family. In 2009 the last owner died, and left the house and grounds &quot;for the benefit of the community of Selkirkshire and the wider public.&quot; A charitable trust is now planning to restore the building as an art gallery.

===The Selkirk Grace===
The Selkirk Grace has no connection with the town of Selkirk, beyond its name; it originated in the west of Scotland. Although attributed to Robert Burns, the Selkirk Grace was already known in the 17th century, as the &quot;Galloway Grace&quot; or the &quot;Covenanters&#x27; Grace&quot;. It came to be called the Selkirk Grace because Burns was said to have delivered it at a dinner given by the Earl of Selkirk at St Mary&#x27;s Isle Priory, in Kirkcudbright in Galloway.

::::In Scots 
:Some hae meat and canna eat,
:And some wad eat that want it,
:But we hae meat and we can eat,
:Sae let the Lord be thankit.

::::In English
:Some have meat and cannot eat,
:And some would eat that want it,
:But we have meat and we can eat,
:So let God be thanked.

===Sport===
Rugby union plays its role in Selkirk culture and society. Selkirk RFC play in their home games at Philiphaugh, competing in the Scottish Premiership and the Border League.

The town cricket club was formed in 1851 and still plays in the Border League. The cricket ground at Philiphaugh is the site of the Battle of Philiphaugh.

The town also has a footballing tradition, having produced some players of note in the Scottish game including Bobby Johnstone of Hibernian. The Selkirk Football Club, founded in 1880 and part of the Lowland League since 2013, folded in 2018 due to financial troubles.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Scotland and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the nearby Selkirk TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Scotland on 93.5 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Scottish Borders and North Northumberland on 96.8 FM.

The Border Telegraph and Southern Reporter are the town&#x27;s local newspapers.

The absolute minimum temperature of at the nearest weather station is both a daily record, and the record lowest temperature for the UK outside of the Highlands. Conversely, Scotland&#x27;s highest temperature of was recorded at Greycook, St. Boswells just to the east.

<text>Tain ( ) is a royal burgh and parish in the County of Ross, in the Highlands of Scotland.

==Etymology==
The name derives from the nearby River Tain, the name of which comes from an Indo-European root meaning &#x27;flow&#x27;. The Gaelic name, &quot;Baile Dubhthaich&quot;, means &#x27;Duthac&#x27;s town&#x27;, after a local saint also known as Duthus.

==History==
Tain was granted its first royal charter in 1066, making it Scotland&#x27;s oldest royal burgh, commemorated in 1966 with the opening of the Rose Garden by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. The 1066 charter, granted by King Malcolm III, confirmed Tain as a sanctuary, where people could claim the protection of the church, and an immunity, in which resident merchants and traders were exempt from certain taxes.

Little is known of earlier history although the town owed much of its importance to Duthac. He was an early Christian figure, perhaps 8th or 9th century, whose shrine had become so important by 1066 that it resulted in the royal charter. The ruined chapel near the mouth of the river was said to have been built on the site of his birth. Duthac became an official saint in 1419 and by the late Middle Ages his shrine was an important place of pilgrimage in Scotland. King James IV came at least once a year throughout his reign to achieve both spiritual and political aims.

A leading landowning family of the area, the Clan Munro, provided political and religious figures to the town, including the dissenter the Rev. John Munro of Tain (died ca. 1630).

The early Duthac Chapel was the centre of a sanctuary. Fugitives were by tradition given sanctuary in several square miles marked by boundary stones. During the First War of Scottish Independence, Robert the Bruce sent his wife and daughter to the sanctuary for safety. The sanctuary was violated and they were captured by forces loyal to William II, Earl of Ross who handed them over to Edward I of England.

==Facilities==
Tain railway station is on the Far North Line. The station is unmanned; in its heyday it had 30 staff. The station was opened by the Highland Railway on 1 January 1864. From 1 January 1923, the station was owned by the London Midland and Scottish Railway. Then in 1948 the British railways were nationalised as British Railways. After the railways were privatised, the station was served by ScotRail.

Notable buildings in the town include Tain Tolbooth and St Duthus Collegiate Church. The town also has a local history museum, Tain Through Time, and the Glenmorangie distillery.

Tain has two primary schools; Craighill (274 pupils as of April 2011) and Knockbreck (just under 120 pupils as of April 2011). There is also a secondary school, Tain Royal Academy, with 590 pupils as of January 2017.

==RAF Tain==

With conflict looming in the 1930s, an aerodrome large enough for bombers was built next to the town on low alluvial land known as the Fendom bordering the Dornoch Firth. It was home to British, Czech (311 Sqn) and Polish airmen during the Second World War. 

It was abandoned as a flying location after the war and converted to a bombing range for the Fleet Air Arm. In 1939 RAF Lossiemouth opened and was used until 1946 when the airfield was transferred to the Admiralty and becoming Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Lossiemouth then returning to the RAF in 1972 as an RAF airfield and the Tain range reverted to the RAF. Large parts of the original aerodrome were returned to civilian use after the Second World War and some are still accessible.

==Sport &amp; recreation==

Tain Golf Club offers a Championship length links golf course. Overlooking the Dornoch Firth, the course was first designed by Old Tom Morris in 1890. Tain is represented in the Scottish Football Association affiliated North Caledonian Football League by senior football club St Duthus Football Club during the regular football season.

==Local geographical and visitor features==
The Gizzen Briggs are sandbars at the entrance to the Dornoch Firth, and with the right wind, they can be heard at low tide. The so-called &quot;million dollar view&quot; to the north-west of Tain, accessible via the A836 westward towards Bonar Bridge and then the B9176 Struie Road, gives a panoramic view of Dornoch Firth and Sutherland.

Five important castles are in the vicinity – Carbisdale Castle, built for the Dowager Duchess of Sutherland and now a youth hostel; Skibo Castle, once home of the industrialist Andrew Carnegie and now a hotel; Dunrobin Castle, ancestral seat of the Duke of Sutherland (castle and gardens open to the public); Balnagown Castle, ancestral seat of the Clan Ross, restored and owned by Mohammed Al Fayed; and Ballone Castle, restored by the owners of a local crafts business.

Highland Fine Cheeses, run by Ruaridh Stone (the brother of Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone), have a factory at Blarliath Farm, Tain.

Just outside Hill of Fearn near Tain lies the site of the medieval Fearn Abbey.

==Parliamentary burgh==
Tain was a parliamentary burgh, combined with Dingwall, Dornoch, Kirkwall and Wick in the Northern Burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. The constituency was a district of burghs known also as Tain Burghs until 1832, and then as Wick Burghs. It was represented by one Member of Parliament (MP). In 1918 the constituency was abolished, and Tain was merged into Ross and Cromarty.

<text>Hoengseong County is a county located in southwestern Gangwon Province, South Korea, bordering Pyeongchang-gun to the east, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do to the west, Hongcheon-gun to the north, and Wonju-si and Yeongwol-gun to the south.

The roots of &quot;Codonopsis lanceolata&quot; (), a bonnet bellflower species, play an important role in local agriculture, as does Hanwoo beef, a specialty product.

The Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, a notable boarding school, is located in the county, an autonomous private high school that recruits students nationwide.

It may be confused with Hongseong-gun, Chungcheongnam-do because its name is similar.

==Symbols==
* Tree : Zelkova
* Flower : Peony
* Bird : Heron

==History==
During the Goguryeo period (A.D. 413–475), it was called Hoengcheon-hyeon (橫川縣) or Eosamae (於斯買).[8] During the reign of King Gyeongdeok of Silla (AD 551), it was changed to Hwangcheonhyeon (潢川縣) and became the Yeonghyeon of Sakju (now Chuncheon).
In the Goryeo Dynasty, it was changed to Hoengcheon again and subordinated to Sakju as before. Afterwards, it was made as a sub-hyeon of Wonju.
In 1413 (13th year of King Taejong), Hyeongam was placed during the Joseon Dynasty, and Hoengcheon and Hongcheon were renamed Hoengseong in 1414 to avoid confusion due to the similar pronunciation.

==Natural Environment==
The terrain is the Charyeong Mountain Range (車嶺山脈), which branches off from Odaesan of the Taebaek Mountain Range, and extends southwest through the eastern part of the county, and is surrounded by high mountains in the east, south, and north, and the west is a gentle slope.

To the north are Suri Peak (960m), Balgyosan (髮校山, 998m), Taeui Mountain (台議山, 675m), and Oeum Mountain (五音山, 930m), and to the east are Unmusan (雲霧山, 980m), Bongbok Mountain (鳳腹山, 1,022m), Taegi Mountain (泰岐山, 1,261m), Cheongtaesan (靑太山, 1,180m), and Sajasan (獅子山, 1,120m). To the south, it is surrounded by Maehwasan (梅花山, 1,084m), Chiaksan (雉岳山, 1,288m), Hyangnobong (香爐峰, 1,043m), Namtaebong (南台峰, 1,182m), Baehyangsan (拜向山, 808m), and Satgatbong (1,030m), and to the west, Seongjibong (聖地峰, 791m). The characteristic of the mountains within the county is that all the mountains except Bongboksan border the county, forming a circular shape surrounding the county area.

==Climate==
Hoengseong has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers. The climate reflects the location of the mountainous inland area of southwest. There is a wide seasonal difference in temperature. The highest temperature ever recorded in Hoengseong-gun was on August 7, 1990 and the lowest was on December 31, 1927, and it was one of the five coldest temperatures ever recorded in Korea.

==Population==
Hongseong&#x27;s decline of population is the biggest matter among the county&#x27;s residents and officers. The staggering decline has forced the educational system to close small schools (less than ten students per school) to close. Hoengseong county has established incentives for enrolling in the schools.

==Korean beef==
Han-u, or Korean beef, from Hoengseong is widely sold and famous in South Korea. The clean environment of the region makes it possible to rear high-quality Korean beef. The muscles of the cattle are built up through labour in the fields. Beef sets are delivered to department stores in Seoul and other metropolitan cities. Nowadays, improvements to transportation infrastructure have helped reduce the cost. The county began a strategic marketing campaign in 1995 to brand itself as the origin of the highest quality beef in Korea.

==Recreational Areas==
The Hoengseong area features large forested areas thanks to its location. More than four forest resorts are still in operation.

Forests are not completely natural, man-made forests are blended into existing natural forests. All kinds of wildlife, including roe deer, wild pigs, and rabbits, inhabit the forests.

==Wind farms==
Schemes for building wind farms started in 2005 and allowed investors to complete the construction of a first complex in January 2008.

Hoengseong did install wind power plants after 2009. Construction was planned and executed by Japanese developer Eurus Energy and POSCO, installing about 20 plants around windy area.
Total plant locations were divided between the counties of Hoengseong (9) and Pyeongchang (11), respectively.

==Sister cities==
* Linhai, Zhejiang, China
* Kakegawa, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan
* Seocho-gu, Seoul

==Famous people==
Famous people born in Hoengseong County include Kim Heechul of Super Junior, and Lee Hyung-Taik.

<doc id="393135" wikidata="Q1281926" url="?curid=393135" title="Nevanlinna theory">
<text>In the mathematical field of complex analysis, Nevanlinna theory is part of the
theory of meromorphic functions. It was devised in 1925, by Rolf Nevanlinna. Hermann Weyl called it &quot;one of the few great mathematical events of (the twentieth) century.&quot; The theory describes the asymptotic distribution of solutions of the equation &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;, as &quot;a&quot; varies. A fundamental tool is the Nevanlinna characteristic &quot;T&quot;(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;f&quot;) which measures the rate of growth of a meromorphic function.

Other main contributors in the first half of the 20th century were Lars Ahlfors, André Bloch, Henri Cartan, Edward Collingwood, Otto Frostman, Frithiof Nevanlinna, Henrik Selberg, Tatsujiro Shimizu, Oswald Teichmüller,
and Georges Valiron. In its original form, Nevanlinna theory deals with meromorphic functions of one complex variable defined in a disc |&quot;z&quot;| ≤ &quot;R&quot; or in the whole complex plane (&quot;R&quot; = ∞). Subsequent generalizations extended Nevanlinna theory to algebroid functions, holomorphic curves, holomorphic maps between complex manifolds of arbitrary dimension, quasiregular maps and minimal surfaces.

This article describes mainly the classical version for meromorphic functions of one variable, with emphasis on functions meromorphic in the complex plane. General references for this theory are Goldberg &amp; Ostrovskii, Hayman and .

== Nevanlinna characteristic ==

=== Nevanlinna&#x27;s original definition ===

Let &quot;f&quot; be a meromorphic function. For every &quot;r&quot; ≥ 0, let &quot;n&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) be the number of poles, counting multiplicity, of the meromorphic function &quot;f&quot; in the disc |&quot;z&quot;| ≤ &quot;r&quot;. Then define the Nevanlinna counting function by

:formula_1

This quantity measures the growth of the number of poles in the discs |&quot;z&quot;| ≤ &quot;r&quot;, as
&quot;r&quot; increases. Explicitly, let &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the poles of &quot;ƒ&quot; in the punctured disc 0 &lt; |&quot;z&quot;| ≤ &quot;r&quot; repeated according to multiplicity. Then &quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) - &quot;n&quot;(0,&quot;f&quot;), and

:formula_2

Let log+&quot;x&quot; = max(log &quot;x&quot;, 0). Then the proximity function is defined by

:formula_3

Finally, define the Nevanlinna characteristic by (cf. Jensen&#x27;s formula for meromorphic functions)

: formula_4

=== Ahlfors–Shimizu version ===
A second method of defining the Nevanlinna characteristic is based on the formula

:formula_5

where &quot;dm&quot; is the area element in the plane. The expression in the left hand side is called the
Ahlfors–Shimizu characteristic. The bounded term &quot;O&quot;(1) is not important in most questions.

The geometric meaning of the Ahlfors—Shimizu characteristic is the following. The inner integral &quot;dm&quot; is the spherical area of the image of the disc |&quot;z&quot;| ≤ &quot;t&quot;, counting multiplicity (that is, the parts of the Riemann sphere covered &quot;k&quot; times are counted &quot;k&quot; times). This area is divided by which is the area of the whole Riemann sphere. The result can be interpreted as the average number of sheets in the covering of the Riemann sphere by the disc |&quot;z&quot;| ≤ &quot;t&quot;. Then this average covering number is integrated with respect to &quot;t&quot; with weight 1/&quot;t&quot;.

=== Properties ===

The role of the characteristic function in the theory of meromorphic functions in the plane is similar to that of

:formula_6

in the theory of entire functions. In fact, it is possible to directly compare &quot;T&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) and &quot;M&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) for an entire function:

:formula_7

and

:formula_8

for any &quot;R&quot; &gt; &quot;r&quot;.

If &quot;f&quot; is a rational function of degree &quot;d&quot;, then &quot;T&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) ~ &quot;d&quot; log &quot;r&quot;; in fact, &quot;T&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) = &quot;O&quot;(log &quot;r&quot;) if and only if &quot;f&quot; is a rational function.

The order of a meromorphic function is defined by

:formula_9

Functions of finite order constitute an important subclass which was much studied.

When the radius &quot;R&quot; of the disc |&quot;z&quot;| ≤ &quot;R&quot;, in which the meromorphic function is defined, is finite, the Nevanlinna characteristic may be bounded. Functions in a disc with bounded characteristic, also known as functions of bounded type, are exactly those functions that are ratios of bounded analytic functions. Functions of bounded type may also be so defined for another domain such as the upper half-plane.

== First fundamental theorem ==
Let &quot;a&quot; ∈ C, and define

:formula_10

For &quot;a&quot; = ∞, we set &quot;N&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,∞,&quot;f&quot;) = &quot;N&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;), &quot;m&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,∞,&quot;f&quot;) = &quot;m&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;).

The First Fundamental Theorem of Nevanlinna theory states that for every &quot;a&quot; in the Riemann sphere,

:formula_11

where the bounded term &quot;O&quot;(1) may depend on &quot;f&quot; and &quot;a&quot;. For non-constant meromorphic functions in the plane, &quot;T&quot;(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;f&quot;) tends to infinity as &quot;r&quot; tends to infinity,
so the First Fundamental Theorem says that the sum &quot;N&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) + &quot;m&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;f&quot;), tends to infinity at the rate which is independent of &quot;a&quot;. The first Fundamental theorem is a simple consequence
of Jensen&#x27;s formula.

The characteristic function has the following properties of the degree:

:formula_12

where &quot;m&quot; is a natural number. The bounded term &quot;O&quot;(1) is negligible when &quot;T&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) tends to infinity. These algebraic properties are easily obtained from Nevanlinna&#x27;s definition and Jensen&#x27;s formula.

==Second fundamental theorem==

We define (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;f&quot;) in the same way as &quot;N&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) but without taking multiplicity into account (i.e. we only count the number of distinct poles). Then &quot;N&quot;1(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;)
is defined as the Nevanlinna counting function of critical points of &quot;f&quot;, that is

:formula_13

The Second Fundamental theorem says that for every &quot;k&quot; distinct values &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; on the Riemann sphere, we have

:formula_14

This implies

:formula_15

where &quot;S&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) is a &quot;small error term&quot;.

For functions meromorphic in the plane,
&quot;S&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) = o(&quot;T&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;)), outside a set of finite length i.e. the error term is small in comparison with the characteristic for &quot;most&quot; values of &quot;r&quot;. Much better estimates of
the error term are known, but Andre Bloch conjectured and Hayman proved that one cannot dispose of an
exceptional set.

The Second Fundamental Theorem allows to give an upper bound for the characteristic function in terms of &quot;N&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;a&quot;). For example, if &quot;f&quot; is a transcendental entire function, using the Second Fundamental theorem with &quot;k&quot; = 3 and &quot;a&quot;3 = ∞, we obtain that &quot;f&quot; takes every value infinitely often, with at most two exceptions,
proving Picard&#x27;s Theorem.

Nevanlinna&#x27;s original proof of the Second Fundamental Theorem was based on the so-called Lemma on the logarithmic derivative, which says that &quot;m&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;&#x27;/&quot;f&quot;) = &quot;S&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;). A similar proof also applies to many multi-dimensional generalizations. There are also differential-geometric proofs which relate it to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. The Second Fundamental Theorem can also be derived from the metric-topological theory of Ahlfors, which can be considered as an extension of the Riemann–Hurwitz formula to the coverings of infinite degree.

The proofs of Nevanlinna and Ahlfors indicate that the constant 2 in the Second Fundamental Theorem is related to the Euler characteristic of the Riemann sphere. However, there is a very different explanations of this 2, based on a deep analogy with number theory discovered by Charles Osgood and Paul Vojta. According to this analogy, 2 is the exponent in the Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem. On this analogy with number theory we refer to the survey of and the book by .

== Defect relation ==
The defect relation is one of the main corollaries from the Second Fundamental Theorem. The &quot;defect&quot; of a meromorphic function at the point &quot;a&quot; is defined by the formula

:formula_16

By the First Fundamental Theorem, 0 ≤ &quot;δ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) ≤ 1, if &quot;T&quot;(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) tends to infinity (which is always the case for non-constant functions meromorphic in the plane). The points &quot;a&quot; for which &quot;δ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) &gt; 0 are called deficient values. The Second Fundamental Theorem implies that the set of deficient values of a function meromorphic in the plane is at most countable and the following relation holds:

: formula_17

where the summation is over all deficient values. This can be considered as a generalization of Picard&#x27;s theorem. Many other Picard-type theorems can be derived from the Second Fundamental Theorem.

As another corollary from the Second Fundamental Theorem, one can obtain that

: formula_18

which generalizes the fact that a rational function of degree &quot;d&quot; has 2&quot;d&quot; − 2 &lt; 2&quot;d&quot; critical points.

==Applications==

Nevanlinna theory is useful in all questions where transcendental meromorphic functions arise,
like analytic theory of differential and functional equations holomorphic dynamics, minimal surfaces, and 
complex hyperbolic geometry, which deals with generalizations of Picard&#x27;s theorem to higher 
dimensions.

== Further development ==

A substantial part of the research in functions of one complex variable in the 20th century was focused on 
Nevanlinna theory. One direction of this research was to find out whether the main conclusions of Nevanlinna
theory are best possible. For example, the &quot;Inverse Problem&quot; of Nevanlinna theory consists in
constructing meromorphic functions with pre-assigned deficiencies at given points. This was solved
by David Drasin in 1976. Another direction was concentrated on the study of various subclasses of the class
of all meromorphic functions in the plane. The most important subclass consists of functions of finite order.
It turns out that for this class, deficiencies are subject to several restrictions, in addition
to the defect relation (Norair Arakelyan, David Drasin, Albert Edrei, Alexandre Eremenko,
Wolfgang Fuchs,
Anatolii Goldberg, Walter Hayman, Joseph Miles, Daniel Shea,
Oswald Teichmüller, Alan Weitsman and others).

Henri Cartan, Joachim and Hermann Weyl and Lars Ahlfors extended Nevanlinna theory to holomorphic curves. This extension is the main tool of Complex Hyperbolic Geometry. Henrik Selberg and Georges Valiron extended
Nevanlinna theory to algebroid functions. Intensive research in the classical one-dimensional theory still continues.

<text>Whithorn (; ), is a royal burgh in the historic county of Wigtownshire in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, about south of Wigtown. The town was the location of the first recorded Christian church in Scotland, &quot;White/Shining House&quot;, built by Saint Ninian about 397 CE.

==Toponymy==

There is a tradition that St Ninian built a church of stone and lime nearby in the late 4th century; it was called , &#x27;White/Shining House&#x27;. &quot;Whithorn&quot; is a modern form of the Anglo-Saxon version of this name, or , &#x27;White House&#x27;. In Gallovidian Gaelic, it was called , or , the latter a version of the Anglo-Saxon name (Gaelic has no sound corresponding to English &quot;wh&quot;). Ninian dedicated the church to his master Martin of Tours, and when he died (probably in 432) Ninian was buried in the church.

==Early history==
A monastery and diocese of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria was founded on the site in the 8th century, possibly originating with a 6th-century , or monastery of Rosnat. It was the centre of the revived See of Galloway (or Candida Casa) under the patronage of Fergus, Lord of Galloway and Bishop Gille Aldan from the 12th century. The late-medieval cathedral Whithorn Priory is ruinous, much of it having disappeared completely apart from the much-altered aisleless nave and vaults at the former eastern end which once held the shrine of St. Ninian, one of medieval Scotland&#x27;s major pilgrimage destinations. A museum in the town contains finds from the site, which has been extensively excavated in recent years. A late-medieval gateway with the arms of the King of Scots leads into the site of the priory, which contains the 19th-century parish church and a museum of carved stones (Historic Environment Scotland). The collection of early medieval stones is one of the largest in Scotland, and includes the country&#x27;s earliest surviving Christian memorial, the 5th-century inscribed Latinus Stone. The museum layout and display was revised and greatly improved in 2005.

===The crozier===
One of the finest artefacts found at the site is the Whithorn Crozier. The gilded and enamelled crozier is an outstanding example of enamels which were being made in England in the second half of the 12th century, and this one dates to around 1175. It is now housed in the National Museums of Scotland, although it is loaned to the Whithorn Trust Visitor Centre every summer. It is thought that the crozier was buried with the body of Simon de Wedale, who was one of the Bishops of Whithorn.

==Churches==
* St Martin and St Ninian Catholic Church, George St, 1959–60. Designed by Harry Stuart Goodhart Rendel and is his only known building in Scotland. The interior was reordered with the altar brought forward from the east wall following the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. At that time the baldacchino was also demolished, and the decorative ironwork at the baptistry and communion rail scrapped. The original Creetown granite altar was placed outside against the east elevation. A possible source of inspiration is the church of San Julián de los Prados Ovieda, Asturias in Spain. The East elevation has a carved Hew Lorimer crucifix mounted to the wall. The crucifix has not fared well after poor cleaning in 1997 led to significant loss of detail. The church including the quadrant walls is listed Category C(S).
*St Ninian&#x27;s Priory Church, Church of Scotland. Built 1822 using stones from the medieval Whithorn Priory. The tower was added in the mid-19th century. Porch added by Peter MacGregor Chalmers in 1914.

==Geography==
Whithorn&#x27;s link to the sea was the port known as the Isle of Whithorn (a separate community from Whithorn itself and actually a peninsula). It was much used in the Middle Ages by pilgrims arriving by boat. The thirteenth-century Saint Ninian&#x27;s Chapel marked the point where pilgrims came ashore (the roofless remains are looked after by Historic Environment Scotland).

The 1st-century settlement of Rispain Camp, about west of Whithorn, is also in the care of Historic Scotland.

== Railway ==
Whithorn was once served by a railway station until 1950 when the passenger service was withdrawn and the freight services falling victim to the Beeching axe in 1964. The track was lifted in April 1965.

Using the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; of Jack Brent, he fought in the Spanish Civil War of 1936–38, against the fascist forces of General Franco. A memorial plaque was unveiled to him in 2006 on the former butcher&#x27;s shop next to The Pend where he once worked as an assistant. His story is told by his nephew, John Dickie, in the 2012 biography &quot;Geordie&#x27;s Story: A Life of Jack Brent&quot;.

<doc id="393137" wikidata="Q6084068" url="?curid=393137" title="Isle of Whithorn">
<text>Isle of Whithorn (&quot;Port Rosnait&quot; in Gaelic) is one of the most southerly villages and seaports in Scotland, lying on the coast north east of Burrow Head, about three miles from Whithorn and about thirteen miles south of Wigtown in Dumfries and Galloway. Whithorn, (&quot;Taigh Mhàrtainn&quot; in Gaelic), is a former royal burgh in Wigtownshire, Dumfries and Galloway, with which Isle of Whithorn is frequently incorrectly amalgamated or confused. It is referred to locally as &#x27;The Isle&#x27; - never &#x27;the Isle of Whithorn&#x27;.

The village is the location of the long ruined 13th-century Saint Ninian&#x27;s Chapel, previously a chapel linked to Whithorn Priory and a stopping off point for pilgrims landing on Isle Head and making their way to Whithorn. Although no longer a true island, John Ainslie&#x27;s maps as late as 1782 and 1821 show the Isle as an island. The main street was originally a causeway, with the harbour located on what was then the true Isle.

The Isle has a long history of habitation: for example, a survey of the ground between the Isle village and Saint Ninian&#x27;s Chapel revealed Clearance cairns and cultivation furrows, as well as the remains of a rectangular building occupying the crest of the low hill immediately to the west of the chapel, with possible steps leading downhill towards the east.

== Community and amenities ==
A Community Council represents the village and a Church of Scotland church, previously a Free Kirk, sits on the old boatyard, a site extending into the harbour and threatened at exceptionally high tides. There are a bowling club, a basic football pitch and two play areas for the young. The village hall is well used: in August 2008, the community took over management control of this facility and it is now completely refurbished and home to Scotland&#x27;s most southerly cinema, &#x27;Machars Movies&#x27;. Following a substantial award from the Big Lottery Fund, a new tearoom, post office and shop selling gifts and foodstuffs, &#x27;Saint Ninian&#x27;s&#x27;, was built alongside the hall, and this opened in October 2014.

The village has one pub, the Steam Packet Inn. A second pub, the Queen&#x27;s Arms, was closed some years ago and now houses an art gallery and craft shop. Also on the harbour there is a fish shop and general store called Isle Sea Foods; upstairs are a launderette, a toilet and shower facilities. The old village school is now a private house, overlooking the Stinking Port, the bay on the other side of the Isle promontory. A granite war memorial is at the north end of the village just off Main Street, on a mound overlooking the bowling green, with twelve First World War names on it and five Second World War names. The regiments and ships are given for the First World War only.

Fishing is widely available on the lochs, local rivers Bladnoch and Cree, and on the sea itself by boat or from the shore. There are numerous trails and quiet roads for walking, horse riding or cycling. Signposted by the Whithorn Pilgrimage Trust, the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way follows a route southwards from the Southern Upland Way through the Machars, passing through New Luce and the early Christian holy sites of Glenluce Abbey, the White Loch, Whithorn, Isle of Whithorn and St Ninian&#x27;s Cave. The main part of the route from Glenluce to Whithorn is 25 miles (40 km) long.

== History ==
Pliny the Elder died in AD 79 and in his &quot;Natural History&quot; he describes Britain, Ireland and the smaller islands off the coast, one being &quot;vectis&quot; and this has been identified with the Isle of Whithorn. The name &quot;Lucopibia&quot; as used by Ptolemy has also been linked with Whithorn.

This was a haunt for smugglers and a principal harbour for legitimate trade and transport; here you caught the &quot;Countess of Galloway&quot;, the steam packet which would take you to Liverpool and maybe a passage on an emigrant ship to the New World or Australia.

== Isle Castle ==

The Isle Castle is one of the village&#x27;s oldest buildings. The building is comparatively small and is nearly square in plan, although the principle of an L-shaped arrangement is retained. In the early 19th century it was the residence of the Superintendent of the Coastguard, Sir John Reid. The &#x27;Captain&#x27;s Garden&#x27; is an extension into the harbour, now with several houses on it, but originally a garden associated with the castle. Still called the Captain&#x27;s Garden it is decorated with simulated man o&#x27; war gun ports.

Above the door of these quarters is a stone with the initials of Patrick Houston of Drummaston and his wife Margaret Gordon, together with the likely date of construction, 1674. This stone has been moved from the old entrance door of the main building. The angle turrets on the second floor are carried on three plain corbels and do not show at all in the inside of the building. A Gothic-style porch was once attached to the Drumelan burn side of the castle.

The Bysbie corn mill was located on the other side of the Drummulin Burn from the castle and a sizeable mill pond and sluice supplied the water power; the mill remains lie behind the Queen&#x27;s Arms Hotel. A chalybeate &#x27;Spa Well&#x27; was located below the castle as shown by the 1850s 6 inch to the mile OS map.

== St Ninian&#x27;s Chapel ==
The chapel was repaired and partly rebuilt in 1898 by the Marquess of Bute; its main features were preserved. The present ruins are rectangular, measuring internally 31&#x27; × 16&#x27; 6&quot; (9.4 m × 5.0 m). This building was probably erected to replace a 12th to early 13th century chapel, whose foundations were found during excavations and consisted of a nave, 17&#x27; 6&quot; × 16&#x27; 6&quot; (5.3 m × 5.0 m) with a square chancel. The chapel stood within a contemporary enclosure wall, part of which is still standing. An outer enclosure may have once existed, best seen in oblique sunlight, defining a roughly oval area 100&#x27; × 110&#x27; (30 m × 34 m). This outer enclosure may be of the Celtic period. There are no records of the chapel&#x27;s use as a burial ground.

St Ninian is chiefly remembered at Whithorn. However, many places in Scotland are associated with his name, such as Saint Ninian&#x27;s Isle in the River Garnock near Kilwinning. He converted the Southern Picts and therefore journeyed throughout many areas in southern Scotland.

== The Cairn ==
The Isle&#x27;s most familiar landmark is the square, white tower known locally as &#x27;The Cairn&#x27;, that has been a navigational aid for hundreds of years.

From here there are views of the Kirkcudbright coast, the whole of the northern range of the English Lake District mountains, and to the south the rounded, mountainous form of the Isle of Man.

During the Second World War it was the site of a tracking station for anti-aircraft gunnery practice. The set-up was that an aircraft flew up and down in front of the guns, which would try to bring it down. Initially, radio-controlled &#x27;Queen Bee&#x27; aircraft were used, and the flat concrete foundation by the white tower on the cairn, now the location of the Solway Harvester memorial stone, was laid down for one of the control huts. The memorial stone to the Solway Harvester is in the form of an anchor set in a granite block.

== Isle Head ==
This promontory is nearly bisected by Chapel Port east and west. The artificial ditch of the Old Fort is still clearly visible on the approach to Isle Head.

There is a multivallate promontory fort on Isle Head, consisting of three ramparts and two ditches, with a probable fourth rampart now reduced to a slight scarp. On the seaward side of the promontory are intermittent stretches of rubble linking and using natural outcrops of rock; in the south-east corner are inner and outer faces, indicating the footings of a wall up to 3 yards wide. On the levelled summit area are slight indications of rubble walling and artificial scarping on the south and east sides; and in the north-east corner are the possible remains of a hut circle.

A small block of rig is clearly visible on Isle Head, lying between the path leading to the promontory and the ramparts and ditch of the Iron Age fort. The furrows are orientated from NE to SW across the promontory.

A witness cairn was erected in 1997 to commemorate the arrival of the Christian missionary St. Ninian to these shores, and pilgrims are encouraged to place stones with personal messages onto a rock cairn. These cairns are sited in the remains of a building used to house the Isle of Whithorn lifeboat.

The lifeboat building had a roof until well after the Second World War, although the station was closed in 1919, when a motor lifeboat was placed on station at Kirkcudbright. The Lifeboat Station was set up in 1869. During the 50 years that the lifeboat station was operating there were three lifeboats:
* Charlie Peake (1869–1886), 7 launches and 10 lives saved
* Henry and John Leighton (1886–1901), 12 launches and 22 lives saved.
* George and Margaret (1901–1919), six launches and six lives saved.

The Solway Harvester Seat is a granite-hewn bench and is one of two local tributes to the seven-strong local crew of the fishing boat Solway Harvester which sank in a storm off the Isle of Man in January 2000. The other, an anchor set in a stone inscribed with the vessel&#x27;s name, sits atop the nearby hill next to The Cairn.

== The harbour ==

The harbour remains the main focal point of the village. The Isle&#x27;s own fleet is engaged in light trawling and lobster fishing. A number of leisure craft are kept here and the Isle is increasingly being used as a stopping off location for pleasure traffic plying the west coast, and as a launching site for trailer based craft such as small angling boats and diving RIB&#x27;s.

A pier was first erected in the 16th century, but a more substantial structure was erected in 1790 to advance commerce, such as the trade with Whitehaven and other English ports. In 1969 the pier was badly damaged by storm and was only rebuilt after a prolonged campaign by local people. The perch is a reef of rock that runs out from the west side of the mouth of the Isle bay; it can be a hazard to craft coming into the Isle and for many years the end was marked with an iron pole.

In the 19th century the Isle also had strong trade links with Ireland and the Isle of Man, and ships were being built as well as sailed from here. The &quot;Countess of Galloway&quot;, the steam packet, once regularly sailed from here to Liverpool. By the end of the 20th century trading vessels had given way almost entirely to yachts and other leisure craft.

The Wigtown Bay Sailing Club welcomes all visiting yachtsmen whether they arrive by sea or by land with trailered boats. The clubhouse is situated on the harbour and has all the usual facilities. The harbour dries three hours either side of high water, and there is a dedicated visitors&#x27; berth at the outer end of the quay. There are also two slipways for launching trailer boats or dinghies, one of which is at the inner end of the quay and is sheltered in all weathers. The other, which gives access into the bay, can be used at virtually any state of the tide. The club is active throughout the summer with dinghy or cruiser races organised for most weekends and some races mid-week.

An unusual feature of the harbour was a fish trap; a wall or dyke running across part of the upper portion of the inlet which trapped fish as the tide went out. This was still marked as late as the 1850s on the OS map.

==&quot;The Wicker Man&quot;==
Various scenes from the 1973 horror film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; were filmed in and around Isle of Whithorn. The climax of the film was filmed at St Ninian&#x27;s Cave and on the clifftops at Burrow Head. The co-owner of the Isle of Whithorn castle, Elizabeth McAdam Laughland, plus several other local people featured in various scenes.

<text>Quantum turbulence is the name given to the turbulent flow – the chaotic motion of a fluid at high flow rates – of quantum fluids, such as superfluids. The idea that a form of turbulence might be possible in a superfluid via the quantized vortex lines was first suggested by Richard Feynman. The dynamics of quantum fluids are governed by quantum mechanics, rather than classical physics which govern classical (ordinary) fluids. Some examples of quantum fluids include superfluid helium (4He and Cooper pairs of 3He), Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs), polariton condensates, and nuclear pasta theorized to exist inside neutron stars. Quantum fluids exist at temperatures below the critical temperature formula_1 at which Bose-Einstein condensation takes place.

== General properties of superfluids ==

The turbulence of quantum fluids has been studied primarily in two quantum fluids: liquid Helium and atomic condensates. Experimental observations have been made in the two stable isotopes of Helium, the common 4He and the rare 3He. The latter isotope has two phases, named the A-phase and the B-phase. The A-phase is strongly anisotropic, and although it has very interesting hydrodynamic properties, turbulence experiments have been performed almost exclusively in the B-phase. Helium liquidizes at a temperature of approximately 4K. At this temperature, the fluid behaves like a classical fluid with extraordinarily small viscosity, referred to as helium I. After further cooling, Helium I undergoes Bose-Einstein condensation into a superfluid, referred to as helium II. The critical temperature formula_1 for Bose-Einstein condensation of helium is 2.17K (at the saturated vapour pressure), while only approximately a few mK for 3He-B.

Although in atomic condensates there is not as much experimental evidence for turbulence as in Helium, experiments have been performed with rubidium, sodium, caesium, lithium and other elements. The critical temperature for these systems is of the order of micro-Kelvin.

There are two fundamental properties of quantum fluids that distinguish them from classical fluids: superfluidity and quantized circulation.

=== Superfluidity ===
Superfluidity arises as a consequence of the dispersion relation of elementary excitations, and fluids that exhibit this behaviour flow without viscosity. This is a vital property for quantum turbulence as viscosity in classical fluids causes dissipation of kinetic energy into heat, damping out motion of the fluid. Landau predicted that if a superfluid flows faster than a certain critical velocity formula_3 (or alternatively an object moves faster than formula_3 in a static fluid) thermal excitations (rotons) are emitted as it becomes energetically favourable to generate quasiparticles, resulting in the fluid no longer exhibiting superfluid properties. For helium II, this critical velocity is formula_5.

=== Quantized circulation ===
The property of quantized circulation arises as a consequence of the existence and uniqueness of a complex macroscopic wavefunction formula_6, which affects the vorticity (local rotation) in a very profound way, making it crucial for quantum turbulence.

The velocity and density of the fluid can be recovered from the wavefunction formula_7 by writing it in polar form formula_8, where formula_9 is the magnitude of formula_6 and formula_11 is the phase. The velocity of the fluid is then formula_12, and the number density is formula_13. The mass density is related to the number density by formula_14, where formula_15 is the mass of one boson.

The circulation formula_16 is defined to be the line integral along a simple closed path formula_17 within the fluid

formula_18

For a simply-connected surface formula_19, Stokes theorem holds, and the circulation vanishes, as the velocity can be expressed as the gradient of the phase. For a multiply-connected surface, the phase difference between an arbitrary initial point on the curve formula_17 and the final point (same as initial point as formula_17 is closed) must be formula_22, where formula_23 in order for the wavefunction to be single-valued. This leads to a quantized value for the circulation

formula_24

where formula_25 is the &quot;quantum of circulation&quot;, and the integer formula_26 is the charge (or winding number) of the vortex. Multiply charged vortices (formula_27) in helium II are unstable and for this reason in most practical applications formula_28. It is energetically favourable for the fluid to form formula_26 singly-charged vortices rather than a single vortex of charge formula_26, and so a multiply-charged vortex would split into singly-charged vortices. Under certain conditions, it is possible to generate certain vortices with a charge higher than 1.

=== Properties of vortex lines ===
Vortex lines are topological line defects of the phase. Their nucleation makes the quantum fluid&#x27;s region to become a multiply-connected region. As given by Fig 2, density depletion can be observed near the axis, with formula_31 on the vortex line. The size of the vortex core varies between different quantum fluids. The size of the vortex core is around formula_32 for helium II, formula_33 for 3He-B and for typical atomic condensates formula_34. The simplest vortex system in a quantum fluid consists of a single straight vortex line; the velocity field of such configuration is purely azimuthal given by formula_35. This is the same formula as for a classical vortex line solution of the Euler equation, however, classically, this model is physically unrealistic as the velocity diverges as formula_36. This leads to the idea of the Rankine vortex as shown in fig 2, which combines solid body rotation for small formula_37 and vortex motion for large values of formula_37, and is a more realistic model of ordinary classical vortices.

Many similarities can be drawn with vortices in classical fluids, for example the fact that vortex lines obey the classical Kelvin circulation theorem: the circulation is conserved and the vortex lines must terminate at boundaries or exist in the shape of closed loops. In the zero temperature limit, a point on a vortex line will travel accordingly to the velocity field that is generated at that point by the other parts of the vortex line, provided that the vortex line is not straight (an isolated straight vortex does not move). The velocity can also be generated by any other vortex lines in the fluid, a phenomenon also present in classical fluids. A simple example of this is a vortex ring (a torus-shaped vortex) which moves at a self-induced velocity formula_39 inversely proportional to the radius of the ring formula_40, where formula_41. The whole ring moves at a velocity

formula_42

=== Kelvin waves and vortex reconnections ===
Vortices in quantum fluids support Kelvin waves, which are helical perturbations of a vortex line away from its straight configuration that rotate at an angular velocity formula_43, with

formula_44

Here formula_45 where formula_46 is the wavelength and formula_47 is the wavevector.

Travelling vortices in quantum fluids can interact with each other, resulting in reconnections of vortex lines and ultimately changing the topology of the vortex configuration when they collide as suggested by Richard Feynman. At non-zero temperatures the vortex lines scatter thermal excitations, which creates a friction force with the normal fluid component (thermal cloud for atomic condensates). This phenomenon leads to the dissipation of kinetic energy. For example, vortex rings will shrink, and Kelvin waves will decrease in amplitude.

=== Vortex lattice ===

Vortex lattices are laminar (ordered) configurations of vortex lines that can be created by rotating the system. For a cylindrical vessel of radius formula_40, a condition can be derived for the formation of a vortex lattice by minimising the expression formula_49, where formula_50 is the free energy, formula_51 is the angular momentum of the fluid and formula_52 is the rotation, with magnitude formula_53 and axial direction. The critical velocity for the appearance of a vortex lattice is then formula_54.

Exceeding this velocity allows for a vortex to form in the fluid. States with more vortices can be formed by increasing the rotation further, past the next critical velocities formula_55. The vortices arrange themselves into ordered configurations that are called vortex lattices.

=== Two fluid nature ===

At non-zero temperature formula_56, thermal effects must be taken into account. For atomic gases at non-zero temperatures, a fraction of the atoms are not part of the condensate, but rather form a rarefied (large free mean path) thermal cloud that co-exist with the condensate (which, in the first approximation, can be identified with the superfluid component). Since helium is a liquid, not a dilute gas like atomic condensates, there is a much stronger interaction between atoms, and the condensate is only a part of the superfluid component. Thermal excitations (consisting of phonons and rotons) form a viscous fluid component (very short free mean path, analogous to classical viscous fluid governed by the Navier-Stokes equation), called the normal fluid which coexists with the superfluid component. This forms the basis of Tisza&#x27;s and Landau&#x27;s &quot;two-fluid theory&quot; describing helium II as the mixture of co-penetrating superfluid and normal fluid components, with a total density dictated by the equation formula_57. The table displays the key properties of the superfluid and normal fluid components:.

The relative proportions of the two components change with temperature, from an all normal fluid flow at the transition temperature formula_58 (formula_59 and formula_60), to a complete superfluid flow in the zero temperature limit (formula_61 and formula_62). At small velocities, the two-fluid equations are

formula_63

formula_64

formula_65

formula_66

where here formula_67 is the pressure, formula_68 is the entropy per unit mass and formula_69 is the viscosity of the normal fluid component as given by the table above. The first of these equations can be identified as being the conservation of mass equation, while the second equation can be identified as the conservation of entropy. The results of these equations give rise to the phenomena of second sound and thermal counterflow. At large velocities the superfluid becomes turbulent and vortex lines appear; at even larger velocities both normal fluid and superfluid become turbulent.

== Classical vs quantum turbulence ==

Experiments and numerical solutions show that quantum turbulence is an apparently random tangle of vortex lines inside a quantum fluid. The study of quantum turbulence aims to explore two main questions:

# Are vortex tangles really random, or do they contain some characteristic properties or organised structures ?
# How does quantum turbulence compare with classical turbulence?

To understand quantum turbulence it is useful to make connection with the turbulence of classical fluids. The turbulence of classical fluids is an everyday phenomenon, which can be readily observed in the flow of a stream or river as was first done by Leonardo da Vinci in his famous sketches. When turning on a water tap, one notices that at first the water flows out in a regular fashion (called laminar flow), but if the tap is turned up to higher flow rates, the flow becomes decorated with irregular bulges, unpredictably splitting into multiple strands as it spatters out in an ever-changing torrent, known as turbulent flow. Leonardo da Vinci first observed and noted in his private notebooks that turbulent flows of classical fluids include areas of circulating fluid called vortices (or eddies).

The simplest case of classical turbulence is that of homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) held in a statistical steady state. Such turbulence can be created inside of a wind tunnel, for example a channel with air flow propelled by a fan from one side to the other. It is often equipped with a mesh to create a turbulent flow of air. A statistically steady state ensures that the main properties of the flow stabilises even though they fluctuate locally. Due to presence of viscosity, without the continuous supply of energy the turbulence of the flow will decay because of frictional forces. In the wind tunnel, energy is consistently provided by the fan. It is useful to introduce the concept of energy distribution over the length scales, the wavevector formula_70, and the wavenumber formula_71. In one dimension, the wavenumber can be related to the wavelength simply using formula_72. The total energy formula_73 per unit mass is given by

formula_74

where formula_75 is the &quot;energy spectrum&quot;, essentially representing the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy over the wavenumbers. The notion of an energy cascade, where an energy transfer takes place from large scale vortices to smaller scale vortices, which eventually lead to viscous dissipation, was memorably noted by Lewis Fry Richardson. Dissipation occurs at the dissipation length scales formula_76 (termed the Kolmogorov length scale), where formula_77 where formula_78 is the kinematic viscosity. By the pioneering work of Andrey Kolmogorov, the energy spectrum was found to take the form

formula_79

where formula_80 is the energy dissipation rate per unit volume formula_81. The constant formula_17 is a dimensionless constant, that takes the value formula_83. In k-space the value associated to the Kolmogorov length scale is the Kolmogorov wavenumber formula_84, where viscous dissipation occurs.

=== Kolmogorov cascade in quantum fluids ===
For temperatures low enough for quantum mechanical effects to govern the fluid, quantum turbulence is a seemingly chaotic tangle of vortex lines with a highly knotted topology, which move each other and reconnect when they collide. In a pure superfluid, there is no normal component to carry the entropy of the system and therefore the fluid flows without viscosity, resulting in the lack of a dissipation scale formula_76. Analogously to classical fluids, a quantum length scale formula_86 (and the corresponding value in k-space formula_87) can be introduced by replacing the kinematic viscosity in the Kolmogorov length scale with the quantum of circulation formula_88. For scales larger than formula_86, a small polarisation of the vortex lines allows the stretching required to sustain a Kolmogorov energy cascade.

Experiments have been performed in superfluid Helium II to create turbulence, that behave according to the Kolmogorov cascade. One such example of this is the case of two counter-rotating propellers, where both above and below the critical temperature formula_1 a Kolmogorov energy spectrum was observed that is indistinguishable from those observed in the turbulence of classical fluids. For higher temperatures, the existence of the normal fluid component leads to the presence of viscous forces and eventual heat dissipation which warms the system. As a consequence of this friction the vortices become smoother, and the Kelvin waves that arise due to vortex reconnections are smoother than in low-temperature quantum turbulence. Kolmogorov turbulence arises in quantum fluids for energy input at large length scales, where the energy spectrum follows formula_91 in the inertial range formula_92. For length scales smaller than formula_86, instead the energy spectrum follows a formula_94 regime.

For temperatures in the zero limit, the undamped Kelvin waves result in more kinks appearing in the shapes of the vortices. For large length scales the quantum turbulence manifests as a Kolmogorov energy cascade (numerical simulations using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the vortex-filament model confirmed this effect ), with the energy spectrum following formula_91. Lacking thermal dissipation, it is intuitive to assume that quantum turbulence in the low temperature limit does not decay as it would for higher temperatures, however experimental evidence showed that this was not the case: quantum turbulence decays even at very low temperatures. The Kelvin waves interact and create shorter Kelvin waves, until they are short enough that emission of sound (phonons), which results in the conversion of kinetic energy into heat, thus dissipation of energy. This process which shifts energy to smaller and smaller length scales at wavenumbers larger than formula_87 is called the Kelvin wave cascade and proceeds on individual vortices. Low temperature quantum turbulence should thus consist of a double cascade: a Kolmogorov regime (a cascade of eddies) in the inertial range formula_92, followed by a bottle-neck plateau, followed by the Kelvin wave cascade (a cascade of waves) that obeys the same formula_91 law but with different physical origin. This is at current consensus, but it must be stressed that it arises from theory and numerical simulations only: there is currently no direct experimental evidence for the Kelvin wave cascade due to the difficulty of observing and measuring at such small length scales.

=== Vinen turbulence ===
Vinen turbulence can be generated in a quantum fluid by the injection of vortex rings into the system, which has been observed both numerically and experimentally. It has been observed also in numerical simulations of turbulent Helium II driven by a small heat flux and in numerical simulations of trapped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates; it has been found even in numerical studies of superfluid models of the early universe. Unlike the Kolmogorov regime which appears to have a classical counterpart, Vinen turbulence has not been identified in classical turbulence..

Vinen turbulence occurs for very low energy inputs into the system, which prevents the formation of the large scale partially polarised structures that are prevalent in Kolmogorov turbulence, as is shown in Fig 9a. The partial polarization contributes strongly to the amount of non-local interactions between the vortex lines, which can be seen in the figure. In stark contrast, Fig 9b displays the Vinen turbulence regime, where there is very little non-local interaction. The energy spectrum of Vinen turbulence peaks at the intermediate scales around formula_87, rather than at large length scales formula_100. From Fig 10, it can be seen that for small length scales the turbulence follows the typical formula_94 behaviour of an isolated vortex. As a result of these properties Vinen turbulence appears as an almost completely random flow with a very weak or negligible energy cascade.

=== Decay of quantum turbulence ===
Stemming from the different signatures, Kolmogorov and Vinen turbulence follow power laws relating to their temporal decay. For the Kolmogorov regime, after removing the forcing which sustains the turbulence in a statistical steady-state, a decay of formula_102 for the energy and formula_103 for the vortex line density (defined as the vortex length per unit volume) are observed. Vinen turbulence decays temporally at a slower rate than Kolmogorov turbulence: the energy decays as formula_104 and the vortex line density as formula_105.

=== Turbulence in atomic condensates ===
Computer simulations have played a particularly important role in the development of the theoretical understanding of quantum turbulence

Turbulence in atomic condensates has only been studied very recently meaning that there is less information available. Turbulent atomic condensates contain a much smaller number of vortices compared to turbulence in helium. Because of the small size of typical atomic condensates, there is not a large length scale separation between the system size and the inter-vortex size, and therefore k-space is restricted. Numerical simulations suggest that turbulence is more likely to appear in the Vinen regime. Experiments performed in Cambridge have also found the emergence of wave turbulence scaling appearing.

== Generation and detection of quantum turbulence ==

=== Physical generation of quantum turbulence ===

There are a plethora of methods that can be used to generate a vortex tangle (visualised in fig 11) in the laboratory. Here they are listed by the quantum fluid that they can be generated in.

==== QT in helium II ====

* Suddenly towing a grid in the sample of fluid at rest 
* Moving the fluid along pipes or channels using bellows or pumps, creating a superfluid wind tunnel (the TOUPIE experiment in Grenoble )
* Rotating one or two propellers inside a container; the configuration of two counter-rotating propellers is called the &quot;von Karman flow&quot; (e.g. the SHREK experiment in Grenoble)
* Creating shockwaves and cavitation by locally focusing ultrasound (this allows for the generation of quantum turbulence away from the boundaries)
* Oscillating/vibrating forks or wires 
* Applying a heat flux (also termed the &quot;thermal counterflow&quot; ): the prototype experiment is a channel which is open to a helium bath at one end and the opposite is closed and has a resistor. An electric current is passed through the resistor and generates ohmic heat; the heat is carried away from the heater towards the bath by the normal fluid component, while the superfluid moves towards the heater so that the net mass flux is zero as the channel is closed. A relative velocity formula_106 (counterflow) of the two fluid components is set up in this way which is proportional to the applied heat. Above a small critical value of the counterflow velocity, a turbulent vortex tangle is generated.
* Injecting vortex rings (rings are generated by injecting electrons which form a small bubble of about 16 Angstroms in size that are accelerated by an electric field, until, upon exceeding the critical velocity, the vortex ring is nucleated)

==== QT in 3He-B and atomic condensates ====
In 3He-B, quantum turbulence can be generated by the vibration of wires. For atomic condensates, quantum turbulence can be generated by shaking or oscillating the trap which confines the BEC and by phase imprinting the quantum vortices.

=== Detection of quantum turbulence ===
In classical turbulence, one usually measures the velocity, either at a fixed position against time (typical of physical experiments) or at the same time at many positions (typical of numerical simulations). Quantum turbulence is characterised by a disordered tangle of discrete (individual) vortex lines.

In helium II techniques exists to measure the vortex line density formula_107 (the length of vortex lines per unit volume based on detecting the second sound attenuation. The average distance between vortex lines, formula_86, can be found in terms of the vortex line density as formula_109 .

==== Detection in helium II ====

* Measuring the attenuation of second sound waves
* Measuring temperature or pressure gradients 
* Measuring ions trapped in the vortices
* Using tracer particles (small glass or plastic spheres/solid hydrogen snowballs) of size of the order of a micron, and then imaging them using lasers. Techniques that can be used are PIV (particle image velocimetry) or PTV (particle tracking velocimetry). Most recently, excimer helium molecules have been used 
* Using oscillating forks 
* Using cantilevers 
* Using cryogenic hot wires 

==== Detection in 3He-B and atomic condensates ====
Quantum turbulence can be detected in 3He-B in two ways: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and by Andreev scattering of thermal quasiparticles. For atomic condensates, it is typical that the condensate must be expanded (by switching off the trapping potential) so that is sufficiently large for an image to be taken. This procedure has a disadvantage as it leads to the condensate being destroyed. The outcome leads to a 2-dimensional image which allows for the study of 2-dimensional quantum turbulence, but imposes a constraint studying 3-dimensional quantum turbulence using this method. Individual quantum vortices have been observed in 3-dimensions, moving and reconnecting using a technique which extracts small fractions of the condensate at a time, allowing for the observation of a time sequence of the same vortex configuration.

<text>Hongcheon (&quot;Hongcheon-gun&quot;) is a county and city in Gangwon Province, South Korea. The city lies on the northern bank of the Hongcheon River, southeast of Chuncheon. The terrain of the county is mainly mountainous and contains hot springs in the Hongcheong River valley. The county produces ginseng, maize, and vegetables. As of 2012 the county had a population of 70,401 people (including foreigners) in 29,894 households.

==History==
Hongcheon&#x27;s historic name was BulRyeokChunHyeon during the rule of Goguryeo. King Gyeongduk of Silla changed the name to YoungHyeon of Sak-Ju, In 1043, it was named Hongcheon during the reign of King In-Jong. Following the independence of the country on 15 August 1945, many administrative changes were made, affecting the jurisdiction of various units under its control.

Korean Federation for Environmental Movement (KFEM) opened an educational facility in Hongcheon in 1995.

Hongcheon County uses an emblem to represent itself as the “County of Culture and Tourism.” The emblem, a simple depiction of a leaf and dew, symbolizes a clean environment, patriotism, and love of one&#x27;s hometown.

==Geography==

Hongcheon is located in Gangwon Province. The county, located in the middle of the peninsula, is the largest in Korea with an area of about and is reported to be three times the size of Seoul. It is bounded by Chuncheon city on the north, the Inje County and Yangyang County to the northeast, by Gapyeong County of Gyeonggi Province to the west, by Hoengseong and Pyeongchang counties to the south. The county is a middle-level mountainous region, an offshoot of the Baegdu mountain range. The eastern end of the mountain range, where Myeonggae village and Nae township are located, runs in an east–west direction for a length of The western part of the mountain range which has Dongmak village and Seotown extends over a length of in an east–west direction. While the southern part of the hill range covers the Sidong village and the Nam town, the northern part has Jangnam village and Duchon township. The Palbong Mountain (327.4 m) has scenic views of the course of the Hongcheon River; the river forms white sandy banks. The Hongcheon river system which rises the Taebaek mountain watershed, joins the Hongcheon River which forms a small plain area at Seorak-myeon, Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do. It then flows in to the Cheongpyeong Dam in Gyeonggi Province. Gachilbong Sambong Spring is located in Gwangwon-ri, Nae-myeon and originates from the Palbong Mountain; Garyeong Waterfall is located in Waya-ri, Naechon-myeon at the foot of Mt. Baekam (1,099m) which drops through rapids over a height of 50 m. The area is known for medicinal herbs, wild flowers and mountain birds.
The bus terminal provides connections with Gimpo and Incheon airports. A bus ride from Dong Seoul Bus Terminal to Hongcheon is approximately one hour. Naerincheon, a small river, crosses Hongcheon and is the only one in the country which flows north. Nearby is the Daemyung Vivaldi Park Ski World, a ski resort (with 13 ski runs, each with a music theme) and water park called &quot;OceanWorld&quot; in the mountains. Local football club Hongcheon Idu FC play their games at Hongcheon Public Park.

One of the attractions of Hongcheon is &quot;Alpaca World&quot;. Located in the forest of Pungcheon-ri, Hwachon-myeon, Hongcheon-gun, this place is designed to provide communication and experience with animals. It is popular with people because they can meet various animals as well as alpacas.

==Climate==
The climate of Hongcheon County is a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;). Climatic conditions are considered extreme as its location is away from the sea. The minimum temperature recorded is –28.1 °C in January. The climatic data is given in the table below. On 1 August 2018, Hongcheon County recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in South Korea.
==Flora and fauna==

Daisy fleabane, a native plant of North America, was inadvertently introduced to Korea in the 1990s and is found in Hongcheon County also. A strange spot on its leaf was found in daisy fleabanes in June 2011. This was tested in the laboratory and found to be caused by a pest identified as &quot;Septoria erigerontis&quot;.

==Rice cultivation==
The dominant crop grown in the country is called the Sura rice. The county, with its widely varying temperatures between day and night times, and with clean and un polluted water, provides an ideal environmental condition ideal to grow this crop which is considered to be of very high quality with cooked rice retaining its taste for much longer than other species of rice. It is grown in 38% of the land under cultivation in the county. It is also disease resistant and can be stored for a long time.

==Culture==
The county is noted for its beef production with its climatic conditions favorable for raising male calves (bred by artificial insemination) which are bred for their exquisite flavor and texture. They are fed alcohol-fermented feed which is reported to reduce the cholesterol content and give flavor to the beef. The calves are raised for minimum of 27 months.

Cultural festivals celebrated in Hongcheon include the Chal Oksusu (Corn) Festival, Mugunghwa (Hibiscus) Festival, and Ginseng Festival. The Mugunghwa Festival honors the memory of Namgung Eok, a statesman and journalist from Hongcheon. The Hongcheon Ginseng Festival, first held in 2003, is held annually in October to celebrate the medicinal properties of ginseng, considered a miracle medicine in Korea. Traditional Taekkyeon and Dudrak performances are part of the festivities. Previously, the county celebrated Choi Seung-hee Dance Festival in honor of a dancer who developed modern forms of traditional folk dances, but because she spent the latter years of her life in North Korea, she is no longer celebrated.

== Symbol Mark ==
Among the five colors of Mugunghwa petals, blue symbolizes the spirit of the county people, green symbolizes the unpolluted natural environment. Pink symbolizes the fragrance of flowers. Yellow symbolizes the peace of Hongcheon. Red symbolizes the passion of Hongcheon.

The center of the flower represents the cohesive power of the Hongcheon people and the green water droplets in the lower part represent a clean earth.

== Character ==
The name of the character is Mugung-gi (literally Eternal-flag) - a symbol of Hongcheon with MugungHwa (literally Eternal Flower) central to its design incorporating other elements.

The water droplets representing the nature of Hongcheon were expressed to the face. The high-tech antenna on the right expressed its meaning as a character leading the information age.

==Notable sites==
The Korean peninsula has been subject to archaeological excavations for establishing obsidian (a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed as an extrusive igneous rock) at many Paleolithic sites. One such site excavated is located in Hongcheon county, known as Hahwageri III. Several samples collected from the site have been subject to carbon dating. In the first cultural layer, out of the two layers established during the excavations, the finds consists of microliths of obsidian and quartz crystal which are embedded in microblade cores. In addition, arrowheads, cores, anvils, hammerstones and pecking tools have also been recovered, apart from a large cache of obsidian artifacts.

The Suta Temple of Mt Gongjak is a Buddhist shrine at the foot of the Gongjak Mountain which appears like a peacock spreading its wings and its flora consists of azalea and ancient pine trees. It is a national monument that was built in 708, in stone, by the Buddhist priest WonHyo during the reign of King SeongDeok, the 33rd King of Silla.

==Notable people==
It is the birthplace of Lee Young-Pyo, who gained global recognition as the legendary leftback of the 2002 South Korea national football team which reached the semifinal of 2002 World Cup, and went on to play for various top tier teams in Europe such as Tottenham Hotspur and PSV Eindhoven to great acclaim.

<doc id="393141" wikidata="Q1012013" url="?curid=393141" title="Lossiemouth">
<text>Lossiemouth () is a town in Moray, Scotland. Originally the port belonging to Elgin, it became an important fishing town. Although there has been over 1,000 years of settlement in the area, the present day town was formed over the past 250 years and consists of four separate communities that eventually merged into one. From 1890 to 1975, it was a police burgh as Lossiemouth and Branderburgh.

Stotfield, the first significant settlement (discounting Kinneddar which has now disappeared), lies to the north west of the town. Next was the Seatown – a small area between the river and the canal inholding of 52 houses, 51 of which are the historic fisher cottages. When the new harbour was built on the River Lossie, the 18th-century planned town of Lossiemouth, built on a grid system, was established on the low ground below the Coulard Hill. Branderburgh formed the final development during the 19th century. This part of the town developed entirely as a result of the new harbour with its two basins, and eventually covered the entire Coulard Hill; it has an impressive profile when seen from a distance.

==History==

===Roman to Medieval===
Although the Romans never conquered the peoples of the north of Scotland, they made several journeys to the Moray Firth coast. Suspected Roman forts have been discovered at Thomshill, near Elgin and at Easter Galcantray, Cawdor, Nairnshire as well as a suspected marching camp at Wester Alves, Moray. The Greco-Roman astronomer and geographer Ptolemy (c. 90 – c. 168), describes in chapter two of his &quot;Geographa&quot; entitled &quot;Albion Island of Britannia&quot; the mouth of the River Lossie as &quot;ostium Loxa Fluvius&quot;. Settlement in this area has a long history. St Gervadius, a Celtic hermit, inhabited a cave overlooking the entrance to the sea loch, Loch Spynie. In his time, the River Lossie entered the loch further to the south, near Inchbroom. The rocky promontory is recorded in the Chartulary of Moray as Holyman&#x27;s Head and it is said that Gervadius (St Gerardine as he became known in later times) would walk around the headland with a flaming torch to warn ships away from the dangerous rocks. Even today the Halliman Skerries retain the reference to St Gervadius. He died in 934 and his cave was a place of pilgrimage right up to the 16th century. The cave was eventually quarried out.

The settlement at the river mouth is significant particularly in its relationship with the royal burgh of Elgin. An argument between Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray and John Dunbar, 4th Earl of Moray was documented in 1383 regarding the &quot;ownership&quot; of the port of &quot;Losey&quot;. This document mentions that Losey was commonly known to fall within the limits of the episcopal estates. The Bishop&#x27;s description of the port suggests that it was well downstream from his fishing station at Spynie. So it seems likely that Losey was not merely a fishing station but also a trading port that the Elgin burgesses used as a counterbalance to the Royal Burgh of Forres&#x27;s trading port of Findhorn. The dispute with the Earl of Moray went further. That same year of 1383, the Earl wrote to the Elgin burgesses offering them the use of his port at the mouth of the River Spey with no duties, in an attempt to take trade from the Bishop. The port and fishery was mentioned again in 1551.

The loch and the river became separated around 1600. A succession of storms built banks of sand and boulders that eventually closed off the sea entrance. It is documented that in 1609, to avoid flooding, the post-Reformation Protestant Bishop Alexander Douglas took steps to exclude the River Lossie from the loch. Evidence of a sudden and apparently artificial right-angled bend between Caysbriggs and Inchbroom may indicate the location of this diversion.

Modern Lossiemouth has its origins in five separate communities that in time grew into one. These were Kinneddar, Stotfield, Seatown, Lossiemouth, and finally Branderburgh; the most ancient of these are Kinneddar and Stotfield.

===Kinneddar===
Kinneddar (Gaelic: ) has now disappeared as a &quot;ferm toun&quot;, however an old farmhouse still retains its name and is probably its location. A Pictish settlement occupied the area and large numbers of carved stones, now held in Elgin Museum, were found. These stones date the settlement to around the 8th or 9th century. Pictish crosses were found in or near the cemetery and indicate the presence of a Christian establishment. Early documented references to the settlement refer to it as Kenedor dating it to the 10th century; it may, of course, have been a continuation of the original Pictish religious community. Saint Gervadius (Gerardine) is referred to as &quot;Gervadius of Kenedor&quot; and may have been part of this community, establishing his cell in the cave just to the northeast.

Bishop Richard is known to have resided at Kinneddar and for that period, it became the cathedral church of the diocese. However maps dating from the early 16th century clearly show this farming community as King Edward. It is unlikely, though, that this community took its name from King Edward I of England, &quot;The Hammer of the Scots&quot;, even though Edward travelled twice to this area to demonstrate his grip over the country; the most likely explanation is that the early cartographers took the local pronunciation of Kinneddar as King Edward and recorded it as such. He is known to have stayed in Elgin for four days in late July 1296 and it was during this sojourn into Scotland that he removed the Stone of Scone (Stone of Destiny) from Scone Palace and had it placed in a wooden chair at Westminster Abbey. He again stayed in Elgin for two days in September 1303 and then camped at Kinloss Abbey from 13 September to 4 October.

At that time the castle at Kinneddar, along with those at Elgin and Duffus, was left under the control of English garrisons. In 1308, Robert the Bruce, taking advantage of King Edward II&#x27;s preoccupation with matters in England and France, started capturing and usually destroying castles that were either English garrisoned or controlled throughout Scotland. Joined by an army provided by David de Moravia, the Bishop of Moray, Bruce burned the castles of Inverness and Nairn before seizing and burning Kinneddar castle. He attacked Elgin castle only to be twice repulsed before finally succeeding. King Edward had the Bishop ex-communicated causing him to flee to Norway only to return after Edward&#x27;s death.

Kinneddar village was still sizeable in the early 19th century but dwindled away with the building of the new Lossiemouth, just to the east.

===Stotfield===
The early maps, some dating back to the early 16th century, clearly show Stotfield; some maps name the settlement as Stotfold or Stodfauld. The name Stotfold comes from the Middle Scots meaning, &#x27;horse fold&#x27;. King David I introduced settlers from other parts of the kingdom as a way of reducing the powers of the lords who had ruled large territories as independent provinces. Indeed, King David put down a rebellion by the Mormaer of Moray in 1130 and it is possible that Stotfield dated from shortly after this event. The English-speaking inhabitants of the Lothians would most likely have been the chosen settlers. It is notable that the people inhabiting the Lothians were Angles (formally part of the Kingdom of Northumbria).

In the Middle Ages, Stotfield was primarily a farm hamlet with small-scale fishing. The fishing gradually became more important and the population specialised into farm workers and fishermen. However, the religious strictures introduced in the Reformation impacted the community, especially the fishers. The minutes of the Kinneddar Parish Kirk Session clearly show that the ancient superstitions were at least as important to them as observance of church niceties: &quot;17 Aprilis 1670 After Sermon the Session Assembling &amp;c. The said day the fishers of Stotefold &amp; Cousea being remitted from þe Presbetry to this Church discipline for satisfaction of þr (their) great &amp; gross scandall &amp; Idolatrous custome in burning torches on þe new years even The Presbetry having ordained þ&#x27; (that) those psons mor in accession in this transgression þn (than) oþrs (others) satisfy þe discipline in Sacco And oyra according to the arbitrement of þe Sessione. The Session do þrfore (therefore) ordain John Edward in Stotefold to satisfy in Sacco on day &amp; to pay 20s James Jafray in Cousea to satisfy in the Joges two dayes, Wm Innes Wm Hesbein Thomas Edward &amp; John Thome all of þm (them) to testify þr (their) Repentance by standing at þe pillar And ilk ane of þm to pay 20s. Alexr Innes owner of þe Boats of Stotefold, Wm Young owner of þe boats of Cousea each of þm are ordained to pay 4 libs (pounds). In regard that they had not restrained this abuse Conform to þr (their) engagement before þe Presbetry in Ano 66 (year 1666) The fors (four) psons (persons) all of þ snd Compeiring þr sentence being intimated unto þm they accepting &amp; submitting to disciplin were sharpely rebuked exhorted to serious Repentance &amp; enjoyned to satisfy conform to þe ordinance The next Lords day.&quot;

But the practices continued, and 35 years later the minutes from the session records stated: &quot;23 Dec 1705 Also after sermon þe min1&#x27; (the minister) did guard þe Seamen to beware of þe old Heathenish superstitious practice of carrieing of lighted Clevies or torches about þr boats on new years even certifieing all that should be found any manner of way to concurr with or contribute to þe said work—should be put in þe hands of þe civill magistrate.&quot;

This is interesting because it shows that the power to fine parishioners had by then been removed and put in the hands of magistrates.

Parish records from Duffus Kirk show that similar events were happening at Brughsea (Burghead). It is apparent, therefore, that Clavie burning was carried out in the three fisher towns of Brughsea, Causie (Covesea) and Stotefold (Stotfield). It is unlikely that this practice would have been restricted to the three Morayshire locations and likely that it would have been more widespread. Burghead still burns a ceremonial clavie on the eve of the &quot;old&quot; (Julian) new year but it is no longer associated with fishing boats. A puzzling date for the modern ceremony as the 17th-century ones were held on 31 December.
====Stotfield fishing disaster====

The Stotfield fishing disaster struck on 25 December 1806 and every able-bodied male in the village perished in the storm; this had an enormous effect on the Stotfield community. The folk memory of it is still retained among the fishermen of Lossiemouth.

===Seatown===
The Seatown was established at the end of the 17th century when the old port at Spynie became landlocked. A succession of storms had built up large shingle banks to block the outlet of Loch Spynie to the sea. The merchants of Elgin decided that a new harbour that could berth larger trading vessels at the river mouth was required. The fishermen did not use the new pier, however, but continued to sail their boats up to the beach at the Seatown. Seatown is called &quot;The Toonie&quot; by its inhabitants and sometimes referred to as the &quot;Dogwall&quot;. This was a reference to dog-skins that were dried here before being turned into floats for nets.
===Lossiemouth===
In 1685, the Elgin burgh council called upon a German engineer, Peter Brauss, to look at the viability of providing a harbour at the mouth of the River Lossie; he decided that a harbour could be established. The first efforts at the beginning of the 18th century looked to have failed but by 1764, the new jetty had been built at a cost of £1200.

At the time that the new river mouth harbour was being constructed, so too was a more planned development laid out in streets running parallel and right angles to each other. An open square with a cross separated the first settlement from the new. The fishers occupied the houses at the Seatown and the builders, craftsmen and merchants in the new Lossiemouth. Later, a canal cut to drain Loch Spynie, would present a physical barrier to the two communities and entered the River Lossie in this area.

===Branderburgh===
By the early 19th century, the river harbour was busy but its long-term future was unsustainable and meant that a new solution was sought. In 1834, a Stotfield and Lossiemouth Harbour Company was formed to look into building a new harbour at Stotfield Point. That same year, &quot;The Inverness Courier&quot; carried the following: &quot;&quot;A paragraph is quoted from an Elgin paper under the heading &quot;unexampled economy worthy of imitation.&quot; The two senior bailies of the burgh went on behalf of the town to Lossiemouth to meet the gentlemen appointed to stake off the ground for a proposed new harbour. The worthy Magistrates walked the whole distance, five miles out and five miles home, and only spent one shilling! This expenditure consisted of sixpence for whisky and the other sixpence to the waiter.&quot;&quot;
The construction of the new harbour was carried out between 1837 and 1839 but initially in a relatively small form. The beginning of the building process was marked by a ceremony and reported in the &quot;Inverness Courier&quot; as follows, &quot;The ceremony of laying the foundation stone of the inner basin of the new harbour at Stotfield Point, Lossiemouth, took place on the 15th inst [June]. The stone was laid by Lieut. Colonel James Brander of Pitgaveny, the proprietor of the site, with the assistance of the Trinity Lodge of Freemasons, and in presence of the Chairman and shareholders of the Harbour Company, and representatives of the burgh of Elgin.&quot; This was the beginning of the final phase of building that was to become Branderburgh. However, by 1858, the basin had been enlarged further and deepened to at spring tides. This encouraged many fishing families from up and down the coast to move to the town. The harbour as well as having a large herring fleet by now, also shared the available space with trading ships. This prompted the now renamed Elgin and Lossiemouth Harbour Company to build a new second basin at a cost of £18,000. This basin was intended solely for fishing boats and opened in 1860.
Branderburgh, with its characteristic wide streets, continued to push its boundaries westward and by the early 20th century finally joined with Stotfield. A substantial amount of sandstone was quarried from the east side of the town to accommodate this rapid house building project. After Lossiemouth and Branderburgh became a police burgh in 1863, the town evolved to become known as Lossiemouth. Lossiemouth Town Hall was completed in 1885.

====Fishing boats====

The boats used at Stotfield, Seatown and finally Branderburgh were the same as those found across the entire Scottish east coast fishery. Chronologically, these were the two masted luggers, the Skaffies, Fifies and Zulus; then the powered Steam Drifters and Seine Netters.
*The &quot;Skaffie&quot; appeared at the beginning of the 19th century. These boats were initially small so that they could be easily beached, but later versions were heavier when large harbours became prevalent. Their stems were rounded and had raked sterns.
*The &quot;Fifie&quot; was the predominant fishing boat on the east coast from the 1850s until the mid-1880s. The Fifie&#x27;s main features were the vertical stem and stern. Fifies built from 1860 onwards were all decked and from the 1870s onwards the bigger boats were built with carvel planking, i.e. the planks were laid edge to edge instead of the overlapping clinker style of previous boats. Some boats were built up to about in length and were very fast.
*The &quot;Zulu&quot; took its name from the Zulu war that was raging in South Africa at the time. Lossiemouth fisherman William &#x27;Dad&#x27; Campbell was the first to introduce this form of fishing boat. His boat, the &quot;Nonesuch&quot;, had the characteristic vertical stem and steeply raking stern. The Zulu Boats rapidly became very popular in Lossiemouth and then along the whole of the east coast. Because these boats were ultimately very big and fast, they could reach the fishing grounds quickly and return with the catch equally fast.
* The &quot;Steam Drifters&quot; were so called because just like the Fifies and Zulus, they used drift nets. They were large boats, usually in length with a beam of around . Steam drifters had many advantages. They were usually about longer than the sailing vessels, so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important because the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from weather, wind and tide. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. However they did have disadvantages: they were expensive to build and run and as the herring fishery declined they became too expensive to operate.
* The &quot;Seine Netters&quot; initially were converted Fifies and Zulus. From 1906, petrol and paraffin engines began to be installed, initially for auxiliary power. However, as more powerful engines became available, sails (apart from the mizzen sail) were dispensed with. Danish &quot;seine net&quot; boats were landing huge quantities of plaice and other white fish at English east coast ports. Lossiemouth fishermen noted this and a few decided to use the seine net. It was obvious that this would be successful, but they were still hampered by the design and cost of the majority steam boats. John Campbell, nephew of William Campbell who designed the first Zulu boat, saw that a new design was needed to accommodate the large amounts of white fish that could be caught. His boat, the &quot;Marigold&quot;, did very well and over a short period the entire fleet (the first in Scotland) converted to the seine net.

====Morayshire Railway====
The Morayshire Railway was officially opened at ceremonies in Elgin and Branderburgh on 10 August 1852, the steam engines having been delivered to Lossie by sea. It was the first railway north of Aberdeen. Initially it went only the between Lossie and Elgin, but it was later extended south to Craigellachie. The Lossie–Elgin section had three intermediate stops: the Rifle Range Halt, Greens of Drainie and Linksfield. The Great North of Scotland Railway took over the working of the line in 1863 and bought the company in 1881 following the Morayshire Railway&#x27;s return from crippling debt back to solvency. The railway and harbour became very important to the economy of both Lossie and Moray. It was the Morayshire Railway that persuaded Col Brander, of Pitgaveny, to build the bridge from the Seatown to the east beach to encourage more day tripping in the summer months.

===Timeline===

Note: From early maps, Stotfield is known to exist in the 16th century (see National Library of Scotland) but is probably older. Kinneddar is referenced in the 10th century.

==Geography, geology and wildlife==
The town is located on the most northerly point of the south coast of the Moray Firth, at the mouth of the River Lossie. To the west of the town are a sandy beach, golf links and the Royal Air Force station, RAF Lossiemouth. Lossie Forest is a large pine forest that starts on the town&#x27;s south-east boundary and the river splits it into two sections. The south side of the town is joined by the fertile plains of the Laich o&#x27; Moray.

Lossiemouth Beach is a large strip of dunes separated from the rest of the town by the River Lossie, creating a useful sheltered expanse of water. The town looks down onto this natural harbour with a plain promenade street from which the East Beach Bridge leads onto the sands. Ringed plover, grey heron, black-headed gull, oystercatcher, curlew, mallard and other waders feed under the bridge and are easy to watch from the street, and there are vast numbers of water birds in the more rural area further east.

A large part of the town is built on the Coulard Hill which consists of pale grey and yellow sandstones and with these is associated a cherty and calcareous band, known as &quot;&#x27;the cherty rock of Stotfield&#x27; &quot;. This rock is a form of silica that contains micro-crystalline quartz. Also in the calcareous band of the Stotfield rock there is limestone with nodular masses of flint, crystals of galena (lead ore) and iron pyrites. The quarry on the east side of the town that produced the stone for the building of Branderburgh produced the largest variety and total numbers of fossil reptiles from the late Triassic Period to have been found in the UK. This was a total of eight species and 97 individuals; five of the species are unique to Lossiemouth, one of which is an early form of dinosaur. This quarry is ranked as one of Britain&#x27;s most important fossil bearing locations of this period.

Lossiemouth&#x27;s population in 1901 was 3904

==Economy==
Lossiemouth is heavily dependent on the Royal Air Force station for its employment of civilians. In 2005, RAF Lossiemouth along with its neighbour RAF Kinloss contributed £156.5 million (including civilian expenditure) to the Moray economy, of which £76.6 million was retained and spent locally. The bases are responsible for providing, directly or indirectly, 21 per cent of all employment in the area.

Before the RAF, fishing was almost the sole industrialised process in Lossiemouth, but it now contributes very little to the overall economy; in 2001, fishing accounted for 1.62% (55 individuals) of the full-time employment of Lossiemouth. However, some engineering businesses once associated with fishing still exist in the town. Unlike other sizable towns in the area, Lossiemouth has not attracted the large supermarket groups due to its proximity to Elgin, which also provides employment to a significant proportion of the working population.

==Transport==
Three roads converge on the town. The A941 connects to Elgin, while the B9103 joins the A96 (main Inverness to Aberdeen route) and the B9040 connects to Hopeman and Burghead. There is a regular bus service to and from Elgin.

The nearest railway station is at Elgin and offers services every 90 to 120 minutes to both Inverness (about 50 minutes travel time) and Aberdeen (about 90 minutes travel time), and onwards to the rest of the UK. The former Morayshire Railway line to Elgin was closed to passenger traffic in 1964 and goods in 1966. The former railway route has been turned into a footpath, and the edge of the station platform is visible in the main car park near the harbour.

There is a frequent bus service from Lossiemouth to Elgin.

Inverness Airport (36 miles / 58 km) and Aberdeen Airport (62 miles / 100 km) offer a wide range of destinations.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s main football club is Lossiemouth F.C., nicknamed &quot;The Coasters&quot;, who play in the Highland Football League. The club play their home games at Grant Park. They have won several trophies in recent seasons, including the Highland League Cup and several North of Scotland Cups. The local derby had been against Elgin City FC; however their promotion to the higher Scottish leagues in recent years has reduced the frequency of the matches. The town&#x27;s junior football club is Lossiemouth United. RAF Lossiemouth also has a junior football club. In addition, the station has a rugby union and a cricket club that play in their respective North of Scotland leagues and a rugby league side that plays in the Scotland Rugby League as the Moray Eels; most station teams also play in their respective RAF competitions. The Moray Golf Club is the town&#x27;s golf club and has two courses, the &quot;Old Course&quot; established in 1889, designed by Old Tom Morris who predicted that it would become the best in the north, and the 18 hole &quot;New Course&quot;, designed by Sir Henry Cotton, opened in 1979.

==Language==
Lossiemouth, as with all of Moray and almost the entirety of Scotland, was previously Scottish Gaelic speaking. Following the 19th century, the process of Anglicization which had advanced for centuries saw it briefly adopt a dialect of the Scots language – closely related to the Doric dialect that was prevalent in nearby Aberdeenshire – which became dominant before being almost entirely displaced by standard Scottish English.

Many variations of the Doric dialect can be heard along the Grampian coast; identifiable dialects from towns as close as apart (i.e. Lossiemouth and Hopeman) are not unheard of. Just as the Doric is in decline, however, so it is in Lossiemouth. The reasons for this include the demise of Lossiemouth as a fishing port where its fishermen used Scots extensively. In fishing towns such as Peterhead and Fraserburgh, Scots is still widely spoken. In Lossiemouth, though, the high level of employment at the RAF station and a large population of non-Scots (nearly 25%) has hastened this decline. Quite a lot of the words still remain in use but on the whole, Scottish English is increasingly spoken among the indigenous population.

==Twin town==
Lossiemouth has been twinned with Hersbruck in Bavaria, Germany since 1972.

==Snippets==
Two Royal Navy vessels, both named after the River Lossie, were involved in rescues following torpedo sinkings during the Second World War.
* HMS Lossie, a River class frigate, was patrolling in the Indian Ocean. On 29 June 1944, the freighter &quot;Nellore&quot; was sunk and a week later HMS Lossie picked up 112 crewmen including the captain near the Chagos Archipelago and landed them at Addu Atoll.
* HMS River Lossie (requisitioned Aberdeen drifter A332) picked up the master and 41 crew members of the merchant ship &quot;Cairnmona&quot; off Rattray Head on 30 October 1939 after she was sunk by a German U-boat while in a convoy bound from Montreal to Leith and Newcastle.

Lossiemouth was mentioned in &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;; character Bernard Woolley thought it was a type of dog food.

<text>The NC-4 is a Curtiss NC flying boat that was the first aircraft to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, albeit not non-stop. The NC designation was derived from the collaborative efforts of the Navy (N) and Curtiss (C). The NC series flying boats were designed to meet wartime needs, and after the end of World War I they were sent overseas to validate the design concept.

The aircraft was designed by Glenn Curtiss and his team, and manufactured by Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, with the hull built by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Corporation in Bristol, Rhode Island.

In May 1919, a crew of United States Navy and US Coast Guard aviators flew the NC-4 from New York State to Lisbon, Portugal, over the course of 19 days. This included time for stops for numerous repairs and crewmen&#x27;s rest, with stops along the way in Massachusetts, Nova Scotia (on the mainland), Newfoundland, and twice in the Azores Islands. Then its flight from the Azores to Lisbon completed the first transatlantic flight between North America and Europe, and two more flights from Lisbon to northwestern Spain to Plymouth, England, completed the first flight between North America and Great Britain. This accomplishment was somewhat eclipsed in the minds of the public by the first &quot;nonstop&quot; transatlantic flight, made by the Royal Air Force pilots John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown two weeks later.
==Background==

The transatlantic capability of the NC-4 was the result of developments in aviation that began before World War I. In 1908, Glenn Curtiss had experimented unsuccessfully with floats on the airframe of an early &quot;June Bug&quot; craft, but his first successful takeoff from water was not carried out until 1911, with an &quot;A-1&quot; airplane fitted with a central pontoon. In January 1912, he first flew his first hulled &quot;hydro-aeroplane&quot;, which led to an introduction with the retired English naval officer John Cyril Porte who was looking for a partner to produce an aircraft with him to attempt win the prize of the newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for the first transatlantic flight between the British Isles and any point in the United States of America, Canada, or Newfoundland—not necessarily nonstop, but using just one airplane. (e.g. changing airplanes in Iceland or the Azores was not allowed.)

Emmitt Clayton Bedell, a chief designer for Curtiss, improved the hull by incorporating the Bedell Step, the innovative hydroplane &quot;step&quot; in the hull allowed for breaking clear of the water at takeoff. Porte and Curtiss were joined by Lt. John H. Towers of the U.S. Navy as a test pilot. The 1914 &quot;America&quot; flying boat produced by Porte and Curtiss was a larger aircraft with two engines and two pusher propellers. The members of the team hoped to claim the prize for a transatlantic flight, however their ambitions were curtailed on 4 August 1914 with the outbreak of World War I in Europe.

Development continued in the U.S. and Porte now back in the Royal Navy&#x27;s flight arm the RNAS, commissioned more flying boats to be built by the Curtiss Company. These could be used for long-range antisubmarine warfare patrols. Porte modified these aircraft, and he developed them into his own set of Felixstowe flying boats with more powerful engines, longer ranges, better hulls and better handling characteristics. He shared this design with the Curtiss Company, which built these improved models under license, selling them to the U.S. Government.

This led in a set of four similar aircraft, the NC-1, NC-2, NC-3 and the NC-4, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first series of four huge Curtiss NC flying boats made for the Navy by the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. The NC-4 made its first test flight on 30 April 1919.

World War I had ended in November 1918, before the completion of the four Curtiss NCs. Then in 1919, with several of the new floatplanes in its possession, the officers in charge of the U.S. Navy decided to demonstrate the capability of the seaplanes with a transatlantic flight. However it was necessary to schedule refueling and repair stops that were also for crewmen&#x27;s meals and sleep and rest breaks—since these Curtiss NCs were quite slow in flight. For example, the flight between Newfoundland and the Azores required many hours of night flight because it could not be completed in one day.

==Transatlantic flight==

The U.S. Navy&#x27;s transatlantic flight expedition began on 8 May 1919. The NC-4 started out in the company of two other Curtiss NCs, the NC-1 and the NC-3 (with the NC-2 having been cannibalized for spare parts to repair the NC-1 before this group of planes had even left New York City). The three aircraft left from Naval Air Station Rockaway, with intermediate stops at the Chatham Naval Air Station, Massachusetts, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, before flying on to Trepassey, Newfoundland, on 15 May. Eight U.S. Navy warships were stationed along the northern East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada to help the Curtiss NCs in navigation and to rescue their crewmen in case of any emergency.

The &quot;base ship&quot;, or the flagship for all of the Navy ships that had been assigned to support the flight of the Curtiss NCs, was the former minelayer , which the Navy had converted into a seaplane tender just before the flight of the Curtiss NCs. With a displacement of just over 3,000 tons, &quot;Aroostook&quot; was larger than the Navy&#x27;s destroyers that had been assigned to support the transatlantic flight in 1919. Before the Curtiss NCs took off from New York City, &quot;Aroostook&quot; had been sent to Trepassey, Newfoundland, to await their arrival there, and then provide refueling, relubrication, and maintenance work on the NC-1, NC-3 and NC-4. Next, she steamed across the Atlantic meet the group when they arrived in England.

On 16 May, the three Curtiss NCs departed on the longest leg of their journey, from Newfoundland to the Azores Islands in the mid-Atlantic. Twenty-two more Navy ships, mostly destroyers, were stationed at about spacings along this route. These &quot;station ships&quot; were brightly illuminated during the nighttime. Their sailors blazed their searchlights into the sky, and they also fired bright star shells into the sky to help the aviators to stay on their planned flight path.

After flying all through the night and most of the next day, the NC-4 reached the town of Horta on Faial Island in the Azores on the following afternoon, having flown about . It had taken the crewmen 15 hours, 18 minutes, to fly this leg. The NCs encountered thick fog banks along the route. Both the NC-1 and the NC-3 were forced to land on the open Atlantic Ocean because the poor visibility and loss of a visual horizon made flying extremely dangerous. NC-1 was damaged landing in the rough seas and could not become airborne again. NC-3 had mechanical problems.

The crewmen of the NC-1, including future Admiral Marc Mitscher, were rescued by the Greek cargo ship SS &quot;Ionia&quot;. This ship took the NC-1 in tow, but it sank three days later and was lost in deep water.

The pilots of the NC-3, including future Admiral Jack Towers, taxied their floatplane some to reach the Azores, where it was taken in tow by a U.S. Navy ship.

Three days after arriving in the Azores, on 20 May, the NC-4 took off again bound for Lisbon, but it suffered mechanical problems, and its pilots had to land again at Ponta Delgada, São Miguel Island, Azores, having flown only about . After several days of delays for spare parts and repairs, the NC-4 took off again on 27 May. Once again there were station ships of the Navy to help with navigation, especially at night. There were 13 warships arranged along the route between the Azores and Lisbon. The NC-4 had no more serious problems, and it landed in Lisbon harbor after a flight of nine hours, 43 minutes. Thus, the NC-4 became the first aircraft of any kind to fly across the Atlantic Ocean – or any of the other oceans. By flying from Massachusetts and Halifax to Lisbon, the NC-4 also flew from mainland-to-mainland of North America and Europe. Note: the seaplanes were hauled ashore for maintenance work on their engines.

The part of this flight just from Newfoundland to Lisbon had taken a total time 10 days and 22 hours, but with the actual flight time totaling just 26 hours and 46 minutes.

The NC-4 later flew on to England, arriving in Plymouth on 31 May to great fanfare, having taken 23 days for the flight from Newfoundland to Great Britain. For the final flight legs – from Lisbon to Ferrol, Spain, and then from Ferrol to Plymouth – 10 more U.S. Navy warships were stationed along the route. A total of 53 U.S. Navy ships had been stationed along the route from New York City to Plymouth.

Most of the flight route taken by the NC-4 was indicated on the map of the North Atlantic published by &quot;Flight&quot; magazine on 29 May 1919, while the NC-4 was still on the mainland of Portugal.

The feat of making the first transatlantic flight was somewhat eclipsed shortly afterwards by the first &quot;nonstop&quot; transatlantic flight by John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in a Vickers Vimy biplane, when they flew from Newfoundland to Ireland nonstop on 14–15 June 1919, in 16 hours and 27 minutes. Consequently, Alcock and Brown won a prize of £10,000 offered by the newspaper, &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which had been first announced in 1913, and then renewed in 1918, to &quot;the aviator who shall first cross the Atlantic in an aeroplane in flight from any point in the United States, Canada, or Newfoundland to any point in Great Britain or Ireland, in 72 consecutive hours.&quot; The conditions also stipulated that &quot;only one aircraft may be used for each attempt.&quot; Hence, there was no possibility of changing to a fresh aircraft in Iceland, Greenland, the Azores, and beyond.

Alcock and Brown also made their flight nonstop, even though this was not specified in the rules given by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Conceivably, any aviators could have made stops on Iceland, Greenland, or the Azores along the way for refueling, as long as they completed the entire flight within 72 hours. The rule that &quot;only one aircraft may be used&quot; eliminated the possibility of having fresh aircraft, with their fuel tanks already topped off, and new oil in their crankcase(s), waiting for the pilot or pilots to change from one exhausted airplane to a fresh one.

The Curtiss NCs were never entered into the above competition – because the U.S. Navy never planned for their flight to be completed in fewer than 72 hours.

==Flight crew==

The crewmen of the &quot;NC-4&quot; were Albert Cushing Read, the commander and navigator; Walter Hinton and Elmer Fowler Stone (Coast Guard Aviator #1), the two pilots; James L. Breese and Eugene S. Rhoads, the two flight engineers; and Herbert C. Rodd, the radio operator. Earlier, E.H. Howard had been chosen to go as one of the flight engineers, but on 2 May, Howard lost a hand in misjudging his distance from a whirling propeller. Consequently, he was replaced by Rhoads in the crew.

==After the crossing==

After arriving at Plymouth, England, the crewmen of the NC-4, who had been reunited with the crewmen of the less-successful NC-1 and NC-3, went by train to London, and there they received a tumultuous welcome. Next, they visited Paris, France, to be lionized again.

The NC-4 was dismantled in Plymouth, and then loaded onto , the base ship for the Curtiss NC&#x27;s transatlantic flight, for the return journey to the United States. &quot;Aroostook&quot; arriving in New York Harbor on 2 July 1919.

Following the return of all three of the aircrews on board the ocean liner , a goodwill tour of the East Coast of the United States and the Gulf Coast of the Southern States was carried out by the aircrew.

On 9 February 1929, Congress passed Public Law 70-714 (45 Stat. 1157), awarding Congressional Gold Medals to Lt. Commander John H. Towers for &quot;conceiving, organizing, and commanding the first trans-Atlantic flight&quot;, and the six men of the flight crew &quot;for their extraordinary achievement in making the first successful trans-Atlantic flight, in the United States naval flying boat NC-4, in May 1919.&quot; The Navy created a military decoration known as the &quot;NC-4 Medal&quot;.

It is very rare that a Congressional Gold Medal in miniature form be authorized for wear on a naval or military uniform.

The NC-4 is property of the Smithsonian Institution, since it was given to that institution by the Navy after its return home. However, this aircraft was too large to be housed in either the older Smithsonian Arts &amp; Industries Building in Washington, D.C., or in its successor, the 1976-completed &quot;National Air and Space Museum&quot; main building, also in Washington. A smaller model of the NC-4 is kept in the Milestones of Flight Gallery in the National Air and Space Museum, a place of honor, along with the original Wright &quot;Flyer&quot; of 1903; Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of St. Louis of 1927&quot;; Chuck Yeager&#x27;s &quot;Glamorous Glennis&quot; X-1 rocket plane of 1947, and an X-15 rocket aircraft. As of 1974, the reassembled NC-4 is on loan from the Smithsonian to the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida.

<doc id="393148" wikidata="Q1086480" url="?curid=393148" title="Roton">
<text>In theoretical physics, a roton is an elementary excitation, or quasiparticle, seen in superfluid helium-4 and Bose–Einstein condensates with long-range dipolar interactions or spin-orbit coupling. The dispersion relation of elementary excitations in this superfluid shows a linear increase from the origin, but exhibits first a maximum and then a minimum in energy as the momentum increases. Excitations with momenta in the linear region are called phonons; those with momenta close to the minimum are called rotons. Excitations with momenta near the maximum are called maxons.

The term &quot;roton-like&quot; is also used for the predicted eigenmodes in 3D metamaterials using beyond-nearest-neighbor coupling. The observation of such a &quot;roton-like&quot; dispersion relation was demonstrated under ambient conditions for both acoustic pressure waves in a channel-based metamaterial at audible frequencies and transverse elastic waves in a microscale metamaterial at ultrasound frequencies.

==Models==
Originally, the roton spectrum was phenomenologically introduced by Lev Landau in 1947. Currently there exist models which try to explain the roton spectrum with varying degrees of success and fundamentality. The requirement for any model of this kind is that it must explain not only the shape of the spectrum itself but also other related observables, such as the speed of sound and structure factor of superfluid helium-4. Microwave and Bragg spectroscopy has been conducted on helium to study the roton spectrum.

==Bose–Einstein condensation==
Bose–Einstein condensation of rotons has been also proposed and studied. Its first detection has been reported in 2018. Under specific conditions the roton minimum gives rise to a crystal solid-like structure called the supersolid, as shown in experiments from 2019.

<text>Carolina Rediviva is the main building of the Uppsala University Library in Uppsala, Sweden. The building was begun in 1820 and completed in 1841. The original architect was Carl Fredrik Sundvall. Later additions to the building have been designed by Axel Johan Anderberg and Peter Celsing. The name, literally &quot;Carolina Revived&quot;, was given in remembrance of the old &quot;Academia Carolina&quot; building, which had functioned as the university library for most of the 18th century (see Uppsala University Library). Carolina Rediviva is the oldest and largest university library building in the country. It is also the site where the &quot;Codex Argenteus&quot; and the Cancionero de Upsala are kept.

== Exhibition ==

By the entrance hall of the library there is an exhibition hall where some of the most important objects in the library can be seen. Among the items are the &quot;Codex Argenteus&quot;, the map &quot;Carta marina&quot;, and a first edition of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;. The library contains also books stolen from Poland in 17th century by Swedish army (e.g. Łaski&#x27;s Statute or Nicolaus Copernicus books). According to treaty of Oliwa (1660), all these elements should be returned to Poland but till now, Sweden has returned only approximately 0.1% of them.

<doc id="393152" wikidata="Q50346" url="?curid=393152" title="Hwacheon County">
<text>Hwacheon County () is a county in Gangwon Province, South Korea. The northern border is, in some places, within nine kilometres of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Neighboring counties are Cheorwon to the northwest and north, Yanggu to the east, Chuncheon to the south, and the Gyeonggi-do province to the southwest. The county consists largely of mountains and rivers, between which are small farming communities, military bases and military training grounds. The area is renowned for its rivers, lake trout, indigenous otters, and natural scenery.

==Demographics==
As of 2005, the population of Hwacheon stood at 23,822. 12,471 of these people were male; 11,351 were female. Only 90 of these people (0.38%) were foreign residents - 20 male and 70 female. The average household was home to 2.4 people, and 3,577 of the population (15%) was aged 65 or older. These numbers do not reflect soldiers stationed in the area, which are estimated at approximately 35,000 personnel.

==Administrative divisions==
The county administers 4 &quot;myeon&quot; and 1 &quot;eup&quot;.

==History==
===Prehistory and three kingdom period===
Artifacts from the Neolithic period were found in Wirari area in 1964.An ancient residential area was found in Yongamri. The discovery of the remains in Woncheonri in 2011 showcased the presence of Baekje influence in the region.

===Goryeo and Joseon periods===
The region was called Nangcheon County during the Goryeo period, and was a dependent county of Chuncheon. In 1644, the county was abolished and was merged under Kimhwa County, but the county was restored in 1653.The county received its current name in 1897.

===Modern history===
Before 1900, Hwacheon was extremely sparsely populated, with only a few small villages alongside major rivers, due to its rugged terrain and harsh winters. 
In 1919, the region participated in protests as part of the March 1st movement on March 23 and March 28, with the March 23 protest led by Cheondoists.
Hwacheon Dam was completed in 1944 and the electricity it generated proved to be a boon.
After liberation of korea in 1945, the region was initially administered by the DPRK until the ROK took administration from the DPRK during the korean war. The region was the source of conflict during the Korean War due to its strategic value as both a power plant and potential weapon (by intentionally flooding downstream areas). It ended up well inside allied territory with the establishment of the DMZ to the north in 1953.

==Culture==
As Gangwon Province is South Korea&#x27;s coldest region, Hwacheon is home to the yearly Hwacheon Sancheoneo ice fishing festival in which thousands of visitors try to catch as many &quot;sancheoneo&quot; (, wild trout) as possible. This takes place in the Hwacheoncheon (stream) during nearly the entire month of January. The festival organizers claim there are roughly 1,000,000 visitors annually. The Hwacheon Sancheoneo Festival is classified by CNN as one of the 7 wonders of winter.

Other annual events in Hwacheon include the &quot;jjokbae&quot; (, water raft) Festival in late July, the Tomato Festival in mid-August, and the Dragon Festival.

==Food==
Hwacheon is famous for its &quot;samgyeopsal&quot;, a pork dish offered at nearly every restaurant in town. Pork is cooked on a grill over hot coals, cut into bite-sized pieces, and wrapped in a lettuce leaf along with garlic, hot peppers, rice, and various other vegetables and sauces, then eaten by hand. Variants of the meal include using marinated beef.

==Tourism==
*Paroho lake

Paroho is an artificial lake measuring in area. Built during the Japanese colonial rule in 1944, the hydroelectric power station was constructed by the Japanese in order to support the defense industry for their ongoing invasion of the continent.

*Peace Dam

Peace Dam is correspondence dam completed on October 19, 2005, under construction Geumgangsandaem by North Korea. Total storage capacity, one hundred million tons 26.3, length 601 m, height 125 m is a large dam. There are the Bimokpark and Mulmunhall on the left the entrance. Mulmunhall promote the importance of water resources and has been operating a restaurant and other facilities.

== Symbol Mark ==

The image of the flowing water is derived from Hwacheon&#x27;s  resource, &quot;water,&quot; which means high-level welfare through informationization and ideal administrative services. Combining the image of a bird and the shape of water, Hwacheon&#x27;s Korean initial ㅎ is modeled.
