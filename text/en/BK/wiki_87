<text>Jeffrey Robert Bagwell (born May 27, 1968) is an American former professional baseball first baseman and coach who spent his entire 15-year Major League Baseball (MLB) playing career with the Houston Astros.

Originally a Boston Red Sox fourth-round selection from the University of Hartford in the 1989 amateur draft, Bagwell was traded to the Astros in 1990. Bagwell was named the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year in 1991 and won the NL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) in 1994. Bagwell and longtime Astros second baseman Craig Biggio and teammate Lance Berkman were known as the &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot;, and the team experienced consistent success during their careers; Houston finished in first or second place in the NL Central division in eleven of twelve seasons from 1994 to 2005. During that period, the Astros qualified for the playoffs six times, culminating in Bagwell&#x27;s lone World Series appearance in 2005.

Bagwell hit 449 home runs for the Astros, the most in club history, and set numerous other franchise career and single-season records. He is a four-time MLB All-Star, a three-time Silver Slugger winner and a Gold Glove recipient. The only player in MLB history to have six consecutive seasons (1996–2001) with thirty home runs, 100 RBIs, 100 runs scored, and 100 walks, Bagwell is one of twelve players in history to hit 400 home runs and record an on-base percentage (OBP) of .400. He is the only first baseman with at least 400 home runs and 200 stolen bases. Overall, Bagwell batted over .300 six times, had a career OBP of .408 (39th all-time), and had a slugging percentage of .540 (32nd all-time). He was elected to the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2017, Bagwell was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Born in Boston, Massachusetts, as the only son of Janice (née Hare) and Robert Bagwell, Jeff Bagwell and his family moved to Killingworth, Connecticut, when he was one year old. Much of Bagwell&#x27;s family is from the Greater Boston area, including both his parents, and are avid fans of the Boston Red Sox. His favorite baseball player, Carl Yastrzemski, was a longtime left fielder for the Red Sox. Robert, from Watertown, pitched college baseball at Northeastern University and as a semi-professional. Janice, a police officer, grew up in Newton and played softball in local Boston leagues until her 20s. Bagwell&#x27;s parents divorced when he was 11. Precocious and demonstrating much athletic ability early in life, he played a wide variety of sports as a youth. Recalled Janice, Jeff &quot;could throw a ball before he could walk. When he was six months old, we&#x27;d throw a ball to him and he would throw it back.&quot;

Bagwell graduated from Xavier High School, a private all-male Catholic school located in Middletown, Connecticut. A versatile athlete, he excelled at soccer, setting the school goal-scoring mark, played shortstop, and lettered in basketball. In early 1989, Bagwell was honored by Xavier for his character and generosity. He also excelled in American Legion Baseball under coach Fred Tremalgia for Post 75 in Middletown and went on to be named the 2003 American Legion Baseball Graduate of the Year.

==College career==
Bill Denehy, head coach of the University of Hartford, offered Bagwell a scholarship in spite of baseball not being his primary sport. Bagwell&#x27;s acceptance of Hartford&#x27;s baseball scholarship was based at least in part on the lack of a professional soccer league in the United States at the time. At Hartford, Denehy switched Bagwell to third base. Over three seasons playing for Hartford, he batted .413 in 400 at bats, a school record, and, for a time, a New England collegiate record. He also was the school&#x27;s career home run (31) and run batted in (126) leader when he was drafted, and a two-time Eastern College Athletic Conference player of the year. In 1987 and 1988, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham A&#x27;s of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and in 1988 was named the starting third baseman for the East Division in the league&#x27;s annual all-star game.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The Boston Red Sox selected Bagwell in the fourth round (110th overall) of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Throughout his career, Barry Axelrod served as his agent. For his first professional assignment, the Red Sox appointed Bagwell to the Single-A Winter Haven Red Sox of the Florida State League in , where he batted .310 with two home runs. In , while playing for the Double-A New Britain Red Sox, Bagwell won the Eastern League Most Valuable Player Award. In 136 games with New Britain, he batted .333 with 160 hits, four home runs (HR), 61 runs batted in (RBI), 34 doubles, seven triples, 73 bases on balls (BB or walks), 57 strikeouts (SO), .422 on-base percentage (OBP), .457 slugging percentage (SLG) and .880 on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS). He finished first in the league in hits and doubles, second in batting, OBP and OPS, fourth in walks, fifth in SLG, ninth in runs scored and tenth in RBI.

Late in the 1990 season, the Red Sox, who were in search of relief pitching to improve their chances of making the playoffs, contacted the Houston Astros about Larry Andersen. Stan Benjamin, who scouted the New England region for the Astros, recommended that they ask for Bagwell in return. The Astros initially hesitated owing to his sparse home run production, but Benjamin persuaded them, quipping that New Britain&#x27;s Beehive Field was so large that &quot;Babe Ruth couldn&#x27;t hit home runs in that ballpark.&quot; On August 30, 1990, the Red Sox took the Astros&#x27; offer. The trade is now considered one of the most one-sided trades in baseball history; in 2001, ESPN&#x27;s readers named it the second-worst trade in sports history, behind only the Red Sox trading Ruth to the New York Yankees. Although Andersen pitched well down the stretch in 1990 — he allowed three runs in 22 innings — to help the Red Sox secure the American League East division title on the final day of the season, the Oakland Athletics swept them out of the American League Championship Series (ALCS). They then lost Andersen after the season when he was declared a &quot;new-look&quot; free agent due to the third collusion settlement.

According to the Red Sox&#x27; then-general manager, Lou Gorman, the trade made sense at the time. Gorman spent the ensuing years defending the decision-making process that led up to the Bagwell trade. In his 2005 autobiography, &quot;One Pitch from Glory&quot;, Gorman noted that Boston already had Wade Boggs at the major league level at third base, and had rated prospects Tim Naehring and Scott Cooper higher than Bagwell on the organization&#x27;s depth chart. Bagwell had seen some time in the minors at first base, but he was blocked from that position by Mo Vaughn. Gorman pursued Andersen only after receiving assurances from MLB&#x27;s player relations committee that Andersen would not be lost to the new-look free agency. Nevertheless, it is considered one of the most one-sided trades in baseball history. Not only did the Red Sox lose Andersen to free agency after one month, but neither Naehring nor Cooper played in MLB past 1997. The disproportionate results of the trade notwithstanding, Bagwell eventually became acquainted with Andersen and they formed a friendship. &quot;I knew LA and I love him,&quot; Bagwell asserted. &quot;He used to make fun of me when I was playing bad. He said, &#x27;you&#x27;re making me look bad, you have to step it up.&#x27; Look up his numbers. He was pretty good at what he did.&quot;

===Houston Astros===
In spite of the unexpected detour early in Bagwell&#x27;s professional baseball career, he blossomed in Houston, becoming one of the most accomplished players in Astros franchise history. He spent his entire major league career in a Houston uniform and, along with teammate Craig Biggio in their 15 seasons playing together, were a prodigious offensive and defensive unit known as the &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot;, synonymous with the Astros throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. During their 10 peak seasons from 1994 to 2003, they appeared in nine All-Star Games, won five Gold Gloves, ranked in the top five of the Most Valuable Player Award voting five times and averaged 226 runs scored. They totaled 689 home runs, 2,485 RBI and 3,083 runs scored while the Astros advanced to the postseason six times.

With an exaggerated and unusual batting style, Bagwell waited for each pitch in a low crouch, with legs wide open and knees bent nearly 90 degrees, appearing as if he was sitting on an invisible bench. He stepped &quot;back&quot; with his front foot as he began his swing. Next, he would rise from his stance and rotate his hands with the bat forward into his powerful, uppercut swing. &quot;That wide stance keeps him from over striding&quot;, Joe Torre observed, &quot;which can be your biggest problem when you&#x27;re trying to hit for power.&quot; The low crouch also shrunk his strike zone, allowing him to walk more often. Standing 6 feet tall () and weighing , he did not present the image of an imposing, home run-hitting giant that would cause pitchers to be very careful when he batted after he began his major league career.

====Rookie of the Year Award and early career (1991–1993)====
The Astros invited Bagwell to major league camp in spring training of 1991. Bagwell, expecting for the club to assign him to their Triple-A affiliate in Tucson, enthused them with his play. Because they, too, already had an established major leaguer at third base in Ken Caminiti, they approached Bagwell about shifting to first base, which he accepted. Having not previously played the position as a regular, Bagwell received a crash course, playing minor league games in the morning and Astros games in the afternoon until Opening Day. Observed &quot;The Sporting News&quot;: &quot;Rookie Jeff Bagwell never played first base before this spring, but the position is his to lose. It&#x27;s up to his bat.&quot; Thus, Bagwell made the major league club without an assignment to AAA, making the uncommon jump from AA to the major leagues, and made his major league debut on Opening Day. On May 6, he hit the ninth-ever upper-deck home run at Three Rivers Stadium off Bob Kipper in a seventh-inning pinch hit appearance, estimated at . Bagwell hit .350 in September. He finished the year hitting .294 with 15 home runs and 82 RBI while leading the Astros in several offensive categories. He was named the 1991 National League (NL) Rookie of the Year, the first Astros player to win the award, &quot;Baseball America&quot;&#x27;s Rookie of the Year, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year and postseason All-Star and on the Topps&#x27; Rookie All-Star Team.

Bagwell&#x27;s power hike piqued the curiosity of many baseball observers. In two minor league seasons from 1989 to 1990, he had managed six home runs in 932 at bats–a ratio of 155 at bats per home run (AB/HR). With 15 home runs in his first year in Houston, that average shrunk to 36.9. He also exhibited extraordinary plate discipline for a rookie: while ranking tenth in the league in walks with 75, his OBP placed fifth at .387. Of the power surge, commented Bagwell to hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo, &quot;That&#x27;s awesome&quot;, to which he reacted, &quot;Awesome? We can get more out of you than that.&quot; By altering an approach to contact the pitch with topspin as he did when he arriving to Houston, Jaramillo taught Bagwell to hit with backspin, resulting in a soaring trajectory rather than nose diving. He also habituated Bagwell to manipulate the count, waiting for a pitch to drive instead of indiscriminately swinging at any pitch that appeared to be a strike. Accounted Bagwell of the newfound advantage, &quot;I didn&#x27;t hit many home runs in the minor leagues, but when I hit one, when I got backspin on it, it went a long way.&quot;

Although firmly established as the Astros&#x27; first baseman from Opening Day in 1991, Bagwell remarked years later that transitioning from third base was not automatic. First basemen approach fielding plays from their right side, which is opposite to playing third base. He recounted one conversation that occurred during an Astros pitching change in a game against St. Louis. Shortstop Ozzie Smith was on first and asked Bagwell, &quot;How&#x27;s it going?&quot; Bagwell responded, &quot;I&#x27;m really struggling with my backhand.&quot; Smith replied, &quot;Well, here&#x27;s what you do. You can&#x27;t field the ball deep. You have to get out in front of it.&quot; Remarked Bagwell, &quot;I was basically being given a lesson from Ozzie Smith at first base during a pitching change. It&#x27;s pretty cool.&quot;

The next year, Bagwell hit .273, driving in 96 runs with 18 home runs. In 1993, the Astros improved to a third-place finish in the National League West division, and in mid-September, Bagwell was batting .320 with 20 home runs and 88 RBI. However, a pitch from the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; Ben Rivera broke the fourth metacarpal bone in Bagwell&#x27;s left hand, ending his season prematurely. It was the first of three successive seasons that ended early or was interrupted due to an incoming pitch breaking the same bone in that hand. His tendency to dip just before starting to swing made his hand more vulnerable to being hit by inside pitches. His .320 average was sixth in the NL. In February 1994, Bagwell and the Astros agreed to a one-year contract with a $2.4 million base salary (USD, $ million today).

====Unanimous selection for Most Valuable Player Award (1994)====
The most productive season in Bagwell&#x27;s professional career was the strike-shortened 1994 season which set several franchise records. On Opening Day, April 4, against the Montreal Expos, Bagwell hit the game-tying home run while going 3-for-6 as the Astros won in a 12-inning walk-off. For the month of April, he batted .360 with six home runs and added another six home runs in May. In June, he hit 13 home runs, establishing an Astros&#x27; franchise record for one month, while batting .394, 11 doubles, .455 OBP, .899 SLG, and 1.354 OPS. On June 24, he hit three home runs against the Los Angeles Dodgers at the Astrodome — two in the same inning — in a 16–4 rout, becoming the first Astro since Glenn Davis in 1990 to do so. He was the NL Player of the Week for consecutive weeks on June 19 and June 26 and the NL Player of the Month for June, his second career monthly award.

Selected to his first All-Star Game as a reserve, Bagwell had tied Kirby Puckett for the major league RBI lead at 81 going into the All-Star break, and batted .348 with 27 home runs and 74 runs scored. In the All-Star Game, Bagwell entered as a pinch hitter for starting pitcher Greg Maddux, singling off David Cone, and wound up collecting two hits in four at bats. The first player in the majors to reach 100 RBI on July 27, Bagwell homered off José Rijo in a 6–5 win over Cincinnati to give him 101 RBI in his first 101 games. In July, he tied a club record for RBI in any month with 29, which José Cruz and Jimmy Wynn shared. and hit .409 with 11 home runs, 20 walks and 1.384 OPS and collected his second consecutive Player of the Month award. He would hit another three home runs with six walks in nine August games before a pitch from Andy Benes fractured his left hand on August 10 and ended his season in the same manner the season before. Entering that game, Bagwell carried an 18-game hitting streak. Two days later, the strike ended the season for all the major leagues. His production accelerated in 26 games after the All-Star break, as he posted a .432 batting average, .530 OBP, .916 SLG, 1.446 OPS, 10 doubles, 12 home runs, 34 RBI and 30 runs scored. The Astros finished one-half game out of first place in the inaugural season of the National League Central division, a product of MLB&#x27;s division realignment.

Bagwell played in 110 games in the 1994 season, batting .368 with a .750 SLG, 1.201 OPS, 39 home runs, 116 RBI, 104 runs scored, 300 total bases and 213 adjusted OPS (OPS+) in 400 at bats. He led the major leagues in SLG, OPS+, RBI, and total bases, and the NL in runs scored and OPS, but fell short of winning the batting Triple Crown, finishing second for the batting title to Tony Gwynn, who, after batting .394, had the highest average in the major leagues since Ted Williams in 1941. Bagwell finished second in home runs to Matt Williams, who hit 43. Bagwell set the record for the fewest plate appearances in a season reaching 100 of both runs scored and runs driven in and became the first National Leaguer to finish first or second in batting average, home runs, RBI, and runs scored since Willie Mays in . His .750 SLG at the time ranked as the seventh-best ever and was the highest by a National Leaguer since Rogers Hornsby in 1925 (.756). Further, at the time in National League history, the 213 OPS+ trailed only Hornsby&#x27;s 1924 season (222 OPS+) for the second-highest ever. The 116 RBI in 110 games qualified for the 13th-highest ratio in history. He also hit 23 home runs in 56 games at the Astrodome, setting a record that stood for the stadium that was famed to be pitcher-friendly until the Astros moved out following the 1999 season. He set single-season club records for batting average, SLG, OPS, OPS+, AB/HR, and offensive win percentage (.858), and also for home runs, breaking Wynn&#x27;s 27-year-old record, and RBI, breaking Bob Watson&#x27;s record he had set 17 years earlier — later which he again both subsequently broke.

The unanimous winner of the NL Most Valuable Player Award, he became the fourth player in National League history to win by this distinction, and the first Astros player to win the award. Bagwell also won his first Silver Slugger, Gold Glove, and Player of the Year Awards from &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, Associated Press, &quot;Baseball Digest&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot; &quot;Baseball Weekly.&quot; &quot;Crazy stuff happened that year&quot;, Bagwell recalled of his 1994 season. &quot;Every pitch that I was looking for, I got. And when I got it, I didn&#x27;t miss it.&quot; The Astros and Bagwell agreed to a four-year contract on November 23, 1994, worth $27.5 million (USD, $ million today) with the three option years. The average annual value of $6.875 million ($ million today) made him the fifth-highest paid player in the majors.

====Continued peak (1995–96)====

The 1995 season was shortened by 18 games due to the players&#x27; strike that commenced the year before. Bagwell endured a slump through the month of May in which he batted .183. In June, his results started to improve as he batted .339 and followed up in July by driving in 31 runs. Both Bagwell and Derek Bell — included as a &quot;Killer B&quot; — registered 31 RBI that month, breaking the monthly club RBI record. Bagwell had tied the previous record one year earlier to the month. He hit his first two career home runs against Maddux of the Atlanta Braves within a week — on May 28 and June 3 — who ceded eight over the entire season. On July 28 against the Colorado Rockies, Bagwell&#x27;s 10th-inning home run tied the score and two innings later he scored the winning run for a 5–4 final score.

For the third time in three seasons, an incoming pitch broke a bone in Bagwell&#x27;s left hand: on this occasion, it was on July 30 from the Padres&#x27; Brian Williams. Rather than change his successful style, Bagwell resorted to wearing a heavily padded protective batting glove. He returned in September to bat .313 with five home runs and 21 RBI as Houston finished one game behind the Rockies for the NL wild card. Bagwell missed a total of 30 games, appearing in 114 and batted .290 with 21 home runs. He won the 1995 ESPY Awards for Best Breakthrough Athlete and Outstanding Baseball Performer (later renamed &quot;Best Major League Baseball Player&quot;). After the season, he commenced a rigorous training program that enabled him to gain 20 pounds and increased his endurance for the long season. Activities of focus included concentrated weight lifting, change of diet, and the use of creatine and androstenedione.

By the start of the 1996 season, Bagwell and Biggio had gained seniority — even if not necessarily by age — within the Astros clubhouse as well as status as superstars. According to journalist Dayn Perry, the earliest recorded reference to an Astros version of the nickname &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot; encountered via a Google Search occurred that year. Bagwell enforced accountability and preparation which fostered camaraderie and incorporated all players as instrumental to the success of the team. Thus, the Astros raised their level of play, and a new string of playoff appearances followed. In time, all who entered the Astros gym were greeted with a banner that read: &quot;Bagwell&#x27;s Gym. Work Hard. Play Hard. Or Leave.&quot;

On May 7 against Philadelphia, Bagwell reached the 500th RBI of his career with two home runs and four RBI. By hitting his second upper-deck home run at Three Rivers Stadium on May 29 — it travelled — Bagwell joined longtime Pirate Willie Stargell as the only players to homer twice into the stadium&#x27;s upper deck. For the month of May, he batted .360 with .740 SLG, 10 home runs, 31 RBI, 22 runs scored, and four stolen bases. He was named NL Player of the Month, his fourth career monthly award. On June 14, Bagwell tied a major league record with four doubles in one game against San Francisco. He played all 162 games that year, batting .315 with a 1.021 OPS, 31 home runs, 120 RBI, 111 runs scored, and 135 walks. With 21 successful stolen bases in 28 attempts, it was his first season in the 20–20 club, that is, to steal 20 bases while hitting 20 home runs in the same season. Bagwell reached base 324 total times and in all but 11 games. He led the NL in doubles with 48 while earning his second All-Star selection and finishing ninth in the MVP voting.

Rumors had surfaced during the 1996 season that manager Terry Collins did not get along well with Bagwell and Biggio, largely contributing to his dismissal. The Astros hired team color commentator Larry Dierker after the season to replace him. According to his autobiography, &quot;This Ain&#x27;t Brain Surgery&quot;, Dierker was asked during the interview how he would handle the players. His response: &quot;&#x27;Look, I&#x27;m tired of this Bagwell and Biggio s---,&#x27; I said. &#x27;Bagwell and Biggio will not be a problem, believe me.&#x27; I now believe that this statement is the one that got me the job.&quot; The Astros won division titles in four of five seasons with Dierker as manager; however, in each instance, they did not advance past the first round of the playoffs, and 2001 was Dierker&#x27;s last season as the club&#x27;s manager.

====First two playoff appearances (1997–98)====
The 1,000th hit of Bagwell&#x27;s career was a home run on May 20, 1997, off Calvin Maduro, one of his two that game, in a 9–5 win over the Philadelphia Phillies. He was selected to the play in the All-Star Game. Exhibiting above-average speed and baserunning skills for a first baseman, Bagwell became the first full-time first baseman to join the 30–30 club, capping the 1997 season with 31 steals in 41 attempts. The only other first baseman to accomplish the 30–30 club is Joe Carter. Bagwell batted .286 and scored 109 runs. He finished second in the league with both 43 home runs and 135 RBI — the RBI total was a career high — and was third in the MVP balloting. He made the playoffs for the first time in 1997 when the Astros won the National League Central division, the club&#x27;s first appearance in 11 years. The Astros faced the Atlanta Braves in the National League Division Series (NLDS), who swept them in three games. Bagwell, Biggio and Bell combined for two hits in 37 at bats.

In 1998, Bagwell informed a &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; reporter that he was using androstenedione (commonly referred to as &quot;andro&quot;), which at the time the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified it as a nutritional dietary supplement, finding it benign and authorized for non-medicinal purposes. It was considered a &quot;weak&quot; androgen steroid hormone and allegedly in widespread use around the sport at the time. Bagwell hit his first career grand slam while tying a career-high six RBI against Cincinnati on September 8 in a 13–7 victory. It was his 218th career home run, making his streak the then-longest among active players without a grand slam.

Bagwell finished the 1998 season batting .304 with 34 home runs, 111 RBI, 124 runs scored, 19 stolen bases, 109 walks, .424 OBP, .557 SLG, .981 OPS. He ranked third in the league in runs scored and walks, fifth in OPS+, sixth in OBP, and eighth in OPS. The Astros won a franchise-best 102 games while winning the NL Central division title, leading the league in runs scored. Their season ended by defeat to the San Diego Padres in the NLDS, including losing two starts against Kevin Brown — both by a 2–1 score. Bagwell, Bell, and Biggio combined for six hits in 51 at bats in this series.

====MVP runner-up and second player with multiple 40–30 seasons (1999)====
The high school which ruminated Bagwell, Xavier, officially retired his uniform number 9 in a commemoration on January 30, 1999. As the &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot; brand gained increased national attention, journalist Dayn Perry jocosely noted that in 1999 the Astros, &quot;in pursuit of arcane history, used eight players whose last names began with &#x27;B&#x27;&quot;, including Bagwell, Paul Bako, Glen Barker, Bell, Sean Bergman, Lance Berkman, Biggio, and Tim Bogar. On April 21, Bagwell hit three home runs in a 10–3 win against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, his second career three-home run game. The second home run allowed him to overtake Wynn as the Astros&#x27; all-time home run leader at 224 and he tied a career-high with six RBI in one game. Bagwell produced another three-home run game on June 9 against the Chicago White Sox that was a grand slam short of the &quot;home run cycle&quot;, accounted with a solo home run, a three-run home run, and a two-run home run, respectively. The two three-home run games made him the only player to accomplish this feat at two different stadiums in Chicago in the same season.

Nominated to his fourth career All-Star Game, Bagwell to that point in the season had scored or driven in 28.6% of the Astros&#x27; runs, the highest portion of a team&#x27;s offense for which any one player in MLB accounted. He was stationed first in the NL in walks (83), runs scored (81) and OBP (.464), second in home runs (28), RBI (78) and SLG (.648) and stole 17 bases while Houston tenanted percentage points behind Cincinnati for first in the division. On August 20, 1999, he walked a major-league record six times in a 16-inning battle against the Florida Marlins. Bagwell&#x27;s aggregate output in 1999 included leading the major leagues in runs scored (143), bases on balls (149), and games played (162). He also batted .304, hit 42 home runs, 126 RBI, and .591 SLG and stole 30 bases, giving him his second 30–30 season. Further, he paired with Barry Bonds as the only major leaguers to obtain the 40–30 mark (40 home runs and 30 stolen bases) twice. The Astros engulfed the Reds to clinch the NL Central division title in 1999, their third consecutive. They faced Atlanta in an NLDS rematch of two years prior but were defeated in four games. The NL MVP balloting materialized with Bagwell scaled second to the Braves&#x27; Chipper Jones. Bagwell was honored with the third Silver Slugger Award of his career.

====National League runs scored record (2000)====
In a presentation of rankings of active major leaguers prior to the 2000 season, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; slotted Bagwell second among position players behind Ken Griffey Jr., and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; placed him sixth among all players, including pitchers. Bagwell christened the team&#x27;s 2000 move to Enron Field (later renamed Minute Maid Park) with the stadium&#x27;s first-ever hit and first two runs driven in, in a 6–5 exhibition victory over the New York Yankees on March 30. His two-run, ninth-inning home run against Trevor Hoffman in San Diego on June 10 won the contest for Houston, 7–6, and stopped a 10-game road losing streak. On August 14 in Philadelphia, he homered twice and tied a club record with seven RBI in a 14–7 win, shared by Rafael Ramírez and Pete Incaviglia. Five days later against Milwaukee, Bagwell again homered twice for the 299th and 300th of his career; the second home run broke an eighth-inning tie to give Houston a 10–8 win. He joined Hank Aaron, Joe DiMaggio, Frank Robinson and Ted Williams as the fifth player in major league history to record 300 home runs, 1,000 RBI and 1,000 runs scored in his first ten seasons.

Bagwell finished the 2000 season with a career-high 47 home runs, .310 average, .424 OBP, .615 SLG — the second-best mark of his career — for a 152 OPS+. His 152 runs scored was the highest total in a season since Lou Gehrig in 1936, and his 295 runs scored from 1999 to 2000 set a National League two-season record. His pair of cleats from the 2000 season were turned in for display at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. On December 20, 2000, Bagwell and the Astros agreed to a five-year, $85 million (USD, $ million today) contract extension. With an average annual value of $17 million, he became the third-highest paid player in the sport at the time. By 2005, he was the seventh-highest paid player in the sport, receiving $18 million in the fourth year of the deal.

====Sixth consecutive season of 30 HR, 100 RBI, 100 runs scored and 100 BB (2001)====

With a triple on May 7, 2001, against Chicago, Bagwell achieved the 700th extra base hit of his career. For the second time in his career, he reached seven RBI in a game — again tying a club record — at Kansas City on July 7. Over four successive games from July 8–13, Bagwell homered and totaled five home runs in that span. In a contest at Enron Field against the St. Louis Cardinals on July 18, he hit for the cycle. He went 4-for-5 with five RBI as the Astros won, 17–11. He was the NL Player of the Month that July after batting .333 with nine home runs, and breaking his own club record with 36 RBI in a month, exceeding the 34 RBI in the previous August.

While hitting his 32nd home run on August 19, 2001, against Pittsburgh, Bagwell collected his 100th RBI. It was the sixth consecutive season he reached at least 30 home runs and 100 RBI, making him the eighth player in MLB history to achieve such a streak, and the only Houston player to do so. Five days later, also against Pittsburgh, he scored his 100th run, joining Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Babe Ruth as the only players in MLB history with six consecutive seasons of 30 homers, 100 RBI and 100 runs scored. On September 30 at Chicago, Bagwell walked for his 100th of the season, thus making him the only player in MLB history to register six consecutive seasons of at least 30 home runs, 100 RBI, 100 runs scored, and 100 walks. The Astros won the NL Central division title and faced the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS. In spite of Bagwell reaching base in eight of 12 plate appearances by single or by walk, he did not score any runs, and the Braves swept the Astros in three games.

Playing with sound health until 2001, an explosive pain started to progress in his left shoulder during the season. Bagwell underwent surgery to remove bone spurs and to reconstruct a partially torn labrum on October 26, 2001. He had also began to develop arthritis in his right shoulder, which gradually worsened and diminished his playing ability.

====Other milestones (2002–03)====
For the first three months of the 2002 season, Bagwell labored greatly with throwing; he still had not fully recovered from the shoulder surgery of the previous offseason. Even after it improved, it was noticeably less strong than two years prior. In July, he batted .349 with six home runs and 23 RBI. Before a game against the San Diego Padres on August 27, he met with an 11-year-old bone cancer patient named Stephen Rael who asked him to hit a home run for him. Bagwell replied, &quot;I&#x27;m going to try, but I&#x27;m not Babe Ruth.&quot; In the fifth inning, he hit a pitch from Mike Bynum over the left field wall and pointed to the child in the stands as he rounded third base. He later said, &quot;I hit the home run, and he felt it was for him. I&#x27;m glad for that. It made it special.&quot; From August 10–24, Bagwell produced a season-high 15-game hitting streak, marking the 12th consecutive season with at least one double-digit hit streak, a club record, and second to Roberto Alomar with 14 among all then-active players. In September, he batted .343 with 11 multiple-hit games.

During a 3–2 loss to the Montreal Expos on April 26, 2003, Bagwell&#x27;s infield single gave him 2,000 hits for his career, joining Biggio as the only Astro to achieve this mark. Bagwell collected the assist for the final out of a combined no-hitter and 8–0 win over the Yankees on June 11. He scooped a ground ball batted from Hideki Matsui and relayed it to Billy Wagner covering first base, the final of a record six pitchers participating in the feat. Playing the Cincinnati Reds on July 20, 2003, Bagwell hit two home runs for the 400th of his career off Danny Graves, becoming the 35th player in MLB history to do so. ESPN&#x27;s &quot;The List&quot; ranked Bagwell as the second-most underrated athlete of the top four North American professional sports leagues in August 2003, and Biggio third.

====Milestones of 1,500 RBI, 1,500 runs scored and 200 stolen bases (2004)====
When he hit his sixth career grand slam against Milwaukee on April 9, 2004, Bagwell tied a club record. He recorded his 200th career stolen base on August 30 against Cincinnati to become the tenth player in MLB history to reach that plateau while hitting 400 home runs. On September 18, 2004, Bagwell collected his 1,500th career RBI with a single in the third inning against the Brewers. Two innings later, he homered for his 1,500th run scored, becoming just the 29th player in MLB history and the first Astro to reach both milestones. Bagwell finished with 27 home runs, stopping a streak of eight consecutive seasons with at least 30, but extending a streak of 12 with at least 20.

The Astros faced the Braves in the playoffs for the fourth time in Bagwell&#x27;s career in the 2004 NLDS. In Game 3, on October 7, he hit his first career postseason home run off Mike Hampton in the first inning in a 4–2 extra-inning loss. After three failed attempts to advance past the first round of the playoffs earlier in Bagwell&#x27;s career — all to the Braves (1997, 1999, and 2001) — and seven overall in 43 years of franchise history, the Astros defeated the Braves for their first-ever playoff series win. The quartet dubbed the &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot; — this time with the additions of Carlos Beltrán and Lance Berkman — ignited the Astros&#x27; offense, batting .395 (34-for-86) with eight home runs, 21 RBI and 24 runs scored. The Astros scored an NLDS-record 36 runs in all and Bagwell batted .318 with two home runs and five RBI. They advanced to Bagwell&#x27;s first National League Championship Series (NLCS) to face the Cardinals. St. Louis defeated Houston in seven games to advance to the World Series.

====Health issues and World Series drive (2005)====

In February 2005, Bagwell and Biggio were jointly inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. Shortly after the 2005 season began, the chronic arthritic condition in his shoulder that had begun in 2001 finally sidelined him, rendering him inactive for three-quarters of the season. The former Gold Glove winner was now a defensive liability with a severely limited throwing arm; he had to &quot;push&quot; the ball instead of throwing it. Teams began taking advantage of his defensive weakness. Once possessing great ability to throw out the lead runner at third base ahead on bunt plays, Bagwell found it difficult to practice with the other infielders between innings.

Concurrently, Bagwell&#x27;s offensive production suffered, and pressure mounted on Astros management to bench the perennial All-Star; the club had started the season with a 15–30 won–loss record. He hit his last major league home run against Maddux on April 29, tying him for the most against any pitcher with seven. Bagwell continued to play through the pain until, after going 0-for-5 in a loss to the Pirates on May 4, it became so unbearable that he asked manager Phil Garner to remove him from the lineup the following day. He had hit just .250 with three home runs in 88 at-bats. The Astros placed him on the disabled list a few days later, and shoulder surgery followed.

The Astros dramatically improved after their poor start to finish 74–43 over their final 117 games and capture the NL wild card. Rendered unable to throw from his surgery, Bagwell was activated in September as a pinch hitter, and he played a symbolic role in the successful drive to capture their first-ever National League pennant and World Series appearance. Moreover, the Astros secured the pennant against their division rival St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, reversing the outcome from the year prior against the same club.

After having played 4,714 games and their entire major league careers together in Houston, Bagwell and Biggio appeared in their first World Series in 2005. Bagwell was the Astros&#x27; designated hitter in the first two games against the White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field, and was a pinch hitter in the two games played in Houston at Minute Maid Park. His last official major league plate appearance was in the seventh inning of Game 4, when he pinch-hit for pitcher Brandon Backe and grounded out. The White Sox won this contest to sweep the Astros and secure the championship. The White Sox outscored the Astros by a combined six runs, the lowest scoring differential in World Series history.

Together with Biggio, Bagwell received &quot;Baseball America&quot;&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award after the 2005 season.

====Comeback attempt and retirement (2006)====
On January 23, 2006, the Astros indicated that they would file a claim on an insurance policy on Bagwell&#x27;s health to collect approximately $15.6 million of the $17 million in salary owed to him for the 2006 season. Days earlier, orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews had performed a physical examination on Bagwell and determined that he had become &quot;completely disabled&quot; and was unable to play baseball again. Because of the language of the policy, the Astros could not release him without losing their settlement, nor could he take the field. The decision effectively eliminated his chances of playing again in the Major Leagues. On March 28, Cigna rejected the claim, contending that because Bagwell had played during 2005 World Series he could not have become more disabled during the period of baseball inactivity characteristic of the offseason.

Nonetheless, Bagwell still reported to spring training hoping he could contribute in some way during the upcoming 2006 campaign, and to test the injured shoulder. His mere presence in camp put the Astros&#x27; insurance claim into further question, creating an awkward situation between the player and the team. He appeared in several games, batting .219 with two RBI. He never had to make any difficult throws that would place notable stress on his shoulder, as the other infielders shifted toward him. As expected, the Astros put him on the 15-day disabled list in late March with bone spurs in the shoulder. Bagwell disclosed that he was only in good enough condition to play every several days, rather than every day. He was eventually paid the full amount of his contract. The Astros and the insurance company settled the claim in a confidential arrangement the same day he announced his retirement.

The Astros declined to pick up Bagwell&#x27;s $18 million club option for 2007, instead buying it out for $7 million. He filed for free agency in November 2006 but announced his retirement one month later. Owner Drayton McLane and general manager Tim Purpura stated that he would remain in player development department of the Astros organization, as one of the assistants to the general manager.

==After retirement==

Bagwell made his first public appearance at Minute Maid Park since the end of his career on June 28, 2007. Former teammate and long-time friend Biggio had just logged his 3,000th career hit in the seventh inning against the Colorado Rockies. Bagwell, who was in the dugout, emerged to congratulate him. The Astros fans, who had momentarily quieted after cheering Biggio for his achievement, erupted into cheers again the moment Biggio dragged Bagwell onto the playing field and to the first-base line. &quot;The thing with Baggy is that he and I worked so hard here for this city and for this organization,&quot; Biggio remarked. &quot;We made so many sacrifices as far as playing the game and giving your body to a city, a team.&quot; Together, they bowed to the crowd as Bagwell raised Biggio&#x27;s arm, and returned to the dugout. Biggio was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015.

The Houston Astros officially retired Bagwell&#x27;s jersey number 5 on August 26, 2007, prior to the start of a game versus the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was the eighth player in Astros history to have his number retired. Two of Bagwell&#x27;s closest friends and former teammates, Biggio and Brad Ausmus, spoke on his behalf. Said Ausmus, &quot;He was the quintessential teammate. He was a superstar who always put the team before himself. And between him and Bidge (Biggio), they always shouldered the blame we struggled and tried to deflect the credit when we won.&quot; Yastrzemski, Bagwell&#x27;s childhood hero, delivered a special message: &quot;Congratulations, Jeff, on your number being retired. I begged the Red Sox not to trade you when you were in the minors with us. Boston&#x27;s loss was Houston&#x27;s gain. See you in Cooperstown.&quot; Three first bases were used in the game, each embossed with a commemorative insignia and inscription, &quot;No. 5, Jeff Bagwell jersey retirement, Aug. 26, 2007.&quot; One was given to Bagwell and the other two were auctioned to raise funds on behalf of the Astros in Action Foundation.

In 2009, Bagwell received the Bill Shea Distinguished Little League Graduate Award.

Bagwell, along with Craig Biggio were on hand to witness the Astros win their first-ever World Series championship at Dodger Stadium on November 1, 2017. Both were elated at their franchise&#x27;s first championship with Bagwell saying, &quot;I&#x27;m ecstatic. They&#x27;re great kids, they play hard, they never gave up. To see them win, the celebration, excitement, relief...the city of Houston, I&#x27;m sure, is going crazy right now. I couldn&#x27;t be more proud of the guys that represent the Houston Astros right now.&quot; Both Bagwell and Biggio received World Series rings from the Astros during the World Series ring ceremony before an April 3, 2018 game against the Baltimore Orioles.

===Continued employment by the Astros===
As part of a personal services contract Bagwell signed with the Astros, he served as a coach in spring training of 2007.

On July 11, 2010, the Astros hired Bagwell to be their hitting coach, replacing Sean Berry. At the time of the switch, the Astros had the second-worst average (.237) in the majors and the worst OBP (.295). At the end of the season, the team marginally improved, but was still last in the league in OBP (.303) and SLG (.362) and Bagwell announced he would not return as hitting coach.

After a five-year gap in contact with the Astros organization, Bagwell accepted a formal invitation from manager A. J. Hinch to be a guest instructor in spring training of 2015.

Bagwell is currently employed by the Astros as a special advisor to team owner Jim Crane.

===Allegations of steroid use and National Baseball Hall of Fame===
Bagwell was eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for the first time in 2011. Speculation abounded that some baseball writers initially refrained from voting for Bagwell on the premise that he used performance-enhancing drugs, since most of his playing career took place during what is commonly referred to as &quot;the steroid era.&quot; In spite of the speculation, as of 2016, no concrete evidence has surfaced linking him to the use of performance-enhancing drugs. However, one report indicates that he disclosed use of androstenedione to a &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; reporter in 1998. At that time, neither the FDA nor MLB had banned its use. Bagwell has not been connected with any of the 104 positive samples in the 2003 survey tests that were leaked. Bagwell was not among the 89 players named in the &quot;Mitchell Report&quot; released in 2007.

Longtime Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox said the following about Bagwell: &quot;Jeff Bagwell was [in Houston] for so long and starred every year. For me a guy that dominated like that for one team, even in the league stats through the years. His are up there with anybody&#x27;s. I would put him in right away. So he would get my vote on the first ballot.&quot; Still, in spite of the speculation that Bagwell used performance-enhancing drugs, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; sportswriter Bruce Jenkins opined that Bagwell did not have the credentials to be in the Hall of Fame. In July 2015, he acknowledged &quot;that many are suspicious of Bagwell—without proof, as you say. I&#x27;ve always voted for the best players — Bonds, McGwire, Clemens, etc. — so that&#x27;s not a factor for me. I always found Bagwell just a bit short of Hall of Fame material.&quot;

In 2011, Bagwell received 242 votes, or 41.7% of total ballots cast; the threshold for entry is 75%. In his second year on the ballot, he received 321 votes, or 56.0% of the ballots cast. In 2016, he received his highest percentage of the vote to that time, 71.6%. On January 18, 2017, Bagwell was voted into the Hall of Fame with 86.2% of the vote in his seventh year of eligibility. He was inducted on July 30, 2017.

==Highlights==

Per Baseball Reference, Bagwell&#x27;s 79.6 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) ranks sixth-most all-time among first basemen, trailing only Lou Gehrig, Albert Pujols, Jimmie Foxx, Cap Anson, and Roger Connor. He spent the first nine seasons of his career (1991–99) playing home games at the Astrodome, notorious for its reputation as the toughest park in which to hit when baseball was still played there. However, during those nine years, his production at home was nearly identical to his production on the road. In that same period of time, his 160 OPS+ was fourth behind Bonds, McGwire, and Frank Thomas; his 56.7 WAR was third behind Bonds and Ken Griffey Jr. From 1994 to 2000, a span including his age-26 through age-32 seasons, he averaged 41 home runs and 41 doubles per 162 games while batting .309, .433 OBP, and .593 SLG for a 167 OPS+.

Over his career, Bagwell batted at least .300 six times, amassed a 1.000 OPS five times, collected at least 30 home runs eight times, 100 RBI eight times, 100 runs scored nine times, and 100 walks seven times. He is the only player in history to achieve six consecutive seasons (1996–2001) with each of 30 home runs, 100 RBI, 100 runs scored, and 100 walks. Bagwell had seven seasons with 30 home runs and 100 walks; the only players with more are Gehrig, Ruth, Williams, Jim Thome, and Thomas.

Bagwell is one of 12 players in MLB history to hit at 400 home runs and attain a career on-base percentage of at least .400. The only National League first baseman to reach the 30–30 club, he is the only first baseman in history to do it twice. He is also one of only two players in history to have two 40-30 seasons (Barry Bonds being the other). Bagwell is also the only first baseman to reach both 400 home runs and 200 stolen bases. He is just one of 21 players in history to win both a Rookie of the Year Award and an MVP. His 1,529 RBI during the span of his playing career ranked second in the Majors and first among right-handed hitters. He was in the top 10 in the MVP voting five times. From 1994 to 2003, he led all first basemen in stolen bases, doubles, hits, runs, walks, and extra-base hits, was second in games and RBI, and was third in home runs. He is the Astros&#x27; all-time leader in home runs and RBI and is the first Astro to win an MVP.

In addition to stealing over 200 bases in his career, Bagwell contributed significantly around the field as a whole. During one series against Pittsburgh in 1994, the Pirates shifted while he batted, and Bagwell responded with seven opposite-field hits. A standout defender at first base, he won the 1994 Gold Glove award. Remarked &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, &quot;he&#x27;s an extraordinary fielder who excels at charging bunts and throwing runners out at second and third. Although he has average speed, he&#x27;s one of the game&#x27;s smartest baserunners. ...&quot; From 1999 to 2000, his 295 runs scored led the major leagues and set a National League two-season record.

===Commendations===


===Statistical achievements===


===Various accomplishments===
==Personal life==
Since his playing career ended, Bagwell has spent much of his time with his family while sporadically taking coaching and special assignment positions for the Astros. He is married to Rachel Bagwell, his third wife, with whom he has five children in a blended family. Rachel had three children prior to meeting Jeff. Before his marriage to Rachel, Jeff had two daughters, Blake and Bryce. Bagwell married his first wife, model Shaune Bagwell (née Stauffer), in 1992. He later married Ericka Bagwell, with whom he had his two daughters. Rachel Bagwell was the widow of Greater Houston-area hand surgeon Dr. Michael Brown, the owner and founder of Brown Hand Center.

In spite of his professional success, Bagwell has stated that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t enjoy too much of the spotlight&quot; that follows. While giving a tribute to him during the retirement ceremony of his uniform number, longtime friend and former teammate Brad Ausmus noted several little-known facts. &quot;He liked soccer as much as ... baseball&quot; while growing up in Connecticut. He hit three fewer home runs than his boyhood idol, Carl Yastrzemski — 452 to 449. &quot;His baseball card says he&#x27;s six feet tall. He&#x27;s closer to 5&#x27; 10&quot;.&quot; Both Bagwell and Ausmus hit 32 triples in their careers. After his playing career, Bagwell was seen with significantly longer hair. Remarked Ausmus, &quot;I want to confirm he does not have hair extensions.&quot;

In January 2015, Bagwell reportedly sold his home in the Memorial neighborhood of Houston.

Darryl Kile, a former teammate with the Astros, died of a heart attack on June 22, 2002, while an active player for the Cardinals, before a game against the Cubs. The Darryl Kile Good Guy Award was established in his honor, annually for one player on both the Cardinals and the Astros. Bagwell was the first recipient for the Astros in 2003. Ken Caminiti, another former teammate of Bagwell&#x27;s, died on October 10, 2004. Bagwell delivered a eulogy at his funeral.

Bagwell is a recovering alcoholic. He struggled with addiction for several years until 2017.

At the time, androstenedione was a substance of widespread consumption around the major leagues, as the FDA did not prohibit its use; MLB likewise had not found reason to do so. However, it was then already classified as an anabolic steroid and thus banned by the International Olympic Committee, the NFL and the NCAA. In 2004, MLB announced they had listed androstenedione as a banned substance in accordance with their drug policy. In April 2004, the FDA sent letters to 23 pharmaceutical drug companies ordering them to stop distributing products sold as dietary supplements that contain androstenedione.

<doc id="390785" wikidata="Q7151529" url="?curid=390785" title="Paul Jackson (producer)">
<text>Kevin Paul Jackson (born 2 October 1947), credited as Paul Jackson; sometimes as K. Paul Jackson, is an English television director, producer and executive, known for his production roles within the BBC, ITV, and previously, Carlton and Granada. His most famous television work includes &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; and &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, and as the original producer for the sci-fi sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. In 2006, Jackson was named Director of Comedy and Entertainment at ITV.

== Early life ==
Jackson was born in London in 1947, the son of BBC Light Entertainment Producer T. Leslie Jackson, whose credits included the 1950s series &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;. He graduated from the University of Exeter in 1970.

== Career ==

===BBC===
Jackson began his career with the BBC, joining it in 1971 as an assistant floor manager. Over the next 11 years he was promoted, becoming a director, producer and eventually executive producer, working on a range of the best-known shows of the time - the Larry Grayson incarnation of &quot;The Generation Game&quot;, &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and the last series of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; all feature among his credits. However, it is for a quartet of programmes that he is particularly known: &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; (which he produced and directed, and for which he won three BAFTA nominations); &quot;Three of a Kind&quot; (the show featured Tracey Ullman and Lenny Henry and was a winner of the BAFTA award for best entertainment show and a Rose of Montreux); &quot;The Young Ones&quot; (winner of a BAFTA for best comedy); and &quot;Carrott&#x27;s Lib&quot;, a series transmitted live.

He also produced and directed Ben Elton&#x27;s first solo TV project, &quot;Happy Families&quot;, with Jennifer Saunders, Adrian Edmondson, Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry amongst others and the follow-up series to &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, &quot;Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap&quot;.

===Freelance career===
In 1982, Jackson left the BBC and went freelance, producing &quot;The Cannon and Ball Show&quot; for LWT and two series of &quot;Girls on Top&quot; (starring Tracey Ullman, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders and Ruby Wax) for Central Television. Eighteen months later, he set up Paul Jackson Productions, one of the newly created independent producers made possible by the arrival of Channel Four. The company made &quot;Coming Next&quot;, a sketch show with Hale and Pace and Chris Barrie as well as several other series. One series gave Ruby Wax her first solo outing, &quot;Don&#x27;t Miss Wax&quot;, which was produced for Channel Four. At this time Jackson was a member of the council of IPPA, a forerunner of Pact, the body which established terms for trade between independent producers and the BBC and other broadcasters.

PJP was eventually taken over by Noel Gay Television, a company chaired by the British entertainment executive, Bill Cotton. Jackson served as the managing director and the company produced &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, the long-running and internationally successful comedy series, the pilot episode of &quot;Bottom&quot; (Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson) and, working with LWT, the hugely influential Channel Four variety show, &quot;Saturday Live&quot;. &quot;Saturday Live&quot; featured such comedy stars as Lenny Henry, Pamela Stephenson, Michael Barrymore, Peter Cook and Barry Humphries and brought to prominence talents such as Ben Elton (as a performer), Fry and Laurie, Harry Enfield and Julian Clary. The company also held the contract to provide all entertainment programming for the short lived UK satellite service, British Satellite Broadcasting and produced shows featuring then unknown names such as Armando Iannucci, Steve Coogan, Lee Evans and Jack Dee, as well as &quot;The Happening&quot;, a precursor to the long-running BBC show &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;. In 1988 Jackson also co-produced the Oscar-winning short film, &quot;The Appointments of Dennis Jennings&quot;, starring Steven Wright and Rowan Atkinson.

=== Carlton Television ===
In 1991, Jackson was a member of the five-man team which prepared Carlton Television&#x27;s successful bid for the London weekday franchise in the franchise round of that year. He served as a director of programmes for the bid, and was made managing director of the company the night it went on air on 1 January 1993. He later became managing director of Carlton Television Productions, but after the company&#x27;s merger with Central Television in 1994 Jackson felt this model was at odds with the independent production model on which Carlton had been built and he left barely a year later.

=== Return to BBC ===
In 1996 Jackson was appointed head of BBC Entertainment, overseeing the combined output of all the BBC&#x27;s television, radio and online content, the only time one person had responsibility for all three areas; and was subsequently promoted to Controller of BBC Entertainment. His time running the department saw the arrival on screen of comedies such as &quot;People Like Us&quot;, &quot;The Royle Family&quot;, &quot;Marion and Geoff&quot; and &quot;The Office&quot;. He also introduced Ant &amp; Dec to prime time television, with their series &quot;Friends Like These&quot;. Jackson also oversaw the return of the &quot;Parkinson&quot; series for its second long and successful run at the heart of the BBC&#x27;s Saturday night schedule.

=== Granada Television ===
In 2000 Jackson became the CEO of Granada&#x27;s Australian operations. He turned an underperforming joint venture with local broadcaster Network 7 into a successful independent producer which remains successful. In 2005, after a brief period back in the UK, he went to Los Angeles to take control of the five separate entities that were now all owned by the newly merged ITV. Jackson was CEO and President of Granada USA and executive produced many hit shows including the Gordon Ramsay vehicle &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; for Fox, &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot; for NBC (both shows making the number one spot in the US ratings during their first season) and &quot;Game Show Marathon&quot; for CBS as well as &quot;Nanny 911&quot; also for Fox, and numerous cable shows for networks including MTV, VH1, WE and A+E.

===ITV===
In 2006, Jackson returned to the UK as Director of Comedy and Entertainment for the ITV network, intending to return comedy back to the ITV schedule. As well as cementing &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot; into the heart of the network&#x27;s Saturday nights, &quot;Benidorm&quot;, &quot;Headcases&quot;, &quot;Ladies of Letters&quot; and &quot;No Heroics&quot; were all commissioned by Jackson&#x27;s new team, alongside one off comedy films starring talent such as Catherine Tate, Shane Richie, Timothy Spall, Julia McKenzie and Anton Rodgers as well as writers such as Caroline Aherne, Richard Herring and Irvine Welsh.

&quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, which secured the decade&#x27;s highest audience for an entertainment show, was also commissioned during this period. At the end of 2008, after three years at ITV, Jackson returned to making shows. He became CEO of Eyeworks UK, a London-based entertainment producer. In their first year they produced two films featuring Nadya Suleman including &quot;The Octomom&quot;, and a series for Channel Five starring Justin Lee Collins.

==Other interests==
Jackson was the founding chairman of the charity Comic Relief and chairman of its parent organisation, Charity Projects. He remained as chairman for twelve years before following Jane Tewson, one of the founding partners, to Pilotlight, a new venture where he also chaired the board of trustees.
Subsequently, he served as trustee of the UK volunteering charity, Timebank, acting as chairman from 2000 to 2002 and from 2006 to the present day. While Jackson was in Australia he served as a trustee of Pilotlight Australia.
He has at various times been a board member of The International Emmys, The Aspen Comedy Festival, Frappa and the Entertainment Master Class, as well as serving on the board of Natpe during his time in Los Angeles. From 1994 to 1996 Jackson was the chairman of the Royal Television Society and for four years from 2006, chaired their Craft and Design awards. He is currently on the board of the Riverside Theatre Trust and is a Fellow of the Royal Television Society and the Institute of Directors.

The University of Exeter awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Letters in 2004. He held the post of visiting professor in the School of English at the institution for five years. He has for the last ten years been a frequent broadcaster on BBC Radio 4, including five series of his talk show, &quot;In Conversation With...&quot;. Four series of &quot;Britain In A Box&quot; and various one offs such as &quot;LA Stories&quot;, the companion piece &quot;Soho Stories&quot;, &quot;The Sit Down Comedian&quot; and &quot;The Godfathers of Comedy&quot;.

<text>William Clement Stone (May 4, 1902 – September 3, 2002) was an American businessman, philanthropist and New Thought self-help book author.

==Biography==
Stone was born in Chicago, Illinois, on May 4, 1902. His father died in 1905 leaving his family in debt. In 1908 he hawked newspapers on the South Side of Chicago while his mother worked as a dressmaker. By 1915 he owned his own newsstand. In 1918 he moved to Detroit to sell casualty insurance for his mother.

Stone dropped out of high school to sell insurance full-time. He received a diploma from the YMCA Central High School in Chicago. He took courses at Detroit College of Law (now, Michigan State University College of Law) and Northwestern University.

Much of what is known about Stone comes from his autobiography &quot;The Success System That Never Fails&quot;. In that book, he tells of his early business life, which started with selling newspapers in restaurants. At the time, this was a novel thing to do, a departure from the typical practice of boys hawking newspapers on street corners.

At first, restaurant managers of restaurants tried to discourage him, but he gradually won them over by his politeness, charm, persistence and the fact that most restaurant patrons had no objection to this new way of selling papers.

In 1919, he graduated to selling insurance policies in downtown business offices. His mother managed his new career. Then in 1922, he opened his own small insurance agency, Combined Registry Company, in Chicago. By 1930, he had over 1000 agents selling insurance for him across the United States.

In 1947, after his business had grown significantly, Stone built the Combined Insurance Company of America, which provided both accident and health insurance coverage. By 1979, his insurance company exceeded $1 billion in assets. Combined later merged with the Ryan Insurance Group to form Aon Corporation in 1987, and Combined was later spun off by Aon to ACE Limited in April 2008 for $2.56 billion.

Stone considered his success to be an example of the rags-to-riches protagonists in the Horatio Alger stories he admired. He mentored Og Mandino, an alcoholic who became the Executive Editor of &quot;Success Unlimited&quot; Magazine.

In 1951, Stone founded the interfaith group &quot;The Washington Pilgrimage&quot;, which later became the &quot;Religious Heritage of America&quot;. It successfully advocated the Eisenhower administration to add the &quot;under God&quot; to the Pledge of Allegiance.

Stone contributed up to $10 million to President Richard Nixon&#x27;s election campaigns in 1968 and 1972; they were cited in Congressional debates after the Watergate scandal to institute campaign spending limits.
 According to Tim Weiner, in &quot;One Man Against the World: The Tragedy of Richard Nixon&quot;, in 1972 President Nixon&#x27;s lawyer, Herbert Kalmbach, helped raise money for Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign by selling ambassadorships to large donors, including &quot;W. Clement Stone, [who] pledged $3 million.&quot; Stone wanted to become ambassador to Great Britain, &quot;which already was occupied by Ambassador Walter Annenberg, who gave $254,000 in order to stay on&quot; (p. 160).

Stone associated with Napoleon Hill to teach the &quot;Philosophy of Personal Achievement&quot; &quot;Science of Success&quot; course. Stone wrote: &quot;One of the most important days in my life was the day I began to read &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; in 1937. Stone said that the Bible was &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest self-help book&quot;.

Stone died on September 3, 2002, in Evanston, Illinois.

==Books==
Stone emphasized using a &quot;positive mental attitude&quot; to succeed. Stone adopted the motto of his mentor, Napoleon Hill, &quot;Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve (with PMA).&quot; In 1960, Stone teamed up with Napoleon Hill to author &quot;Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude&quot;. The book &quot;Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude&quot; includes the following testimonial from the Rev. Robert H. Schuller on the inside front cover page: &quot;Success Through A Positive Mental Attitude is one of the ten books that has most impacted my faith and my philosophy...no person&#x27;s education is complete without the concepts articulated in it so wisely and so well.&quot; Norman Vincent Peale said that Stone and Hill &quot;have the rare gift of inspiring and helping people...In fact, I owe them both a personal debt of gratitude for the helpful guidance I have received from their writings.&quot; Stone and Hill also founded a monthly digest magazine, entitled &quot;Success Unlimited&quot;. In 1962, Stone wrote the &quot;Success System That Never Fails&quot;, in which he suggested how to become successful and have a healthy, productive lifestyle. In 1964, he and Norma Lee Browning collaborated on writing &quot;The Other Side of the Mind&quot;.

==Publishing==
Stone founded &quot;Success Unlimited&quot; Magazine in collaboration with Napoleon Hill in 1954. They &quot;conceived of the idea of a monthly magazine to supply mental vitamins to revitalize those seeking self-help and wished inspiration...&quot;

In 1965, W. Clement Stone became Chairman of the Board of Hawthorn Books. Stone intended to use the publishing house as a vehicle to supplement his magazine &quot;Success Unlimited.&quot; Then, in 1967 the publishing company was purchased outright by the Clement Stone interests. Hawthorn Books was then later sold in 1977 to W. H. Allen. (as cited by the Harry Ransom Center).

In 1981, the magazine dropped &quot;Unlimited&quot; from its name and adopted the title &quot;Success&quot; until it stopped publication in 2001, shortly before Stone&#x27;s death in 2002.

==Philanthropy==
Stone gave over $275 million to charity including civic groups, mental health and Christian organizations. Stone was once quoted as saying, &quot;All I want to do is change the world&quot;.

Among his philanthropic activities were his long-time support of the Boys Clubs of America (now Boys and Girls Clubs of America), and the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. The Stone Student Center was dedicated on June 24, 1967, on the campus of the Interlochen Center for the Arts. Stone donated one million dollars to Rev. Robert H. Schuller to begin construction on the Crystal Cathedral. The W. Clement and Jessie V. Stone Foundation was established by Stone and his wife to support humanitarian, mental health, religious and community causes. In 2009 the Foundation gave $3,805,625 to worthwhile causes. The foundation also gives college scholarships; one of the beneficiaries is the demographer, pollster, and political pundit Elliott Stonecipher of Shreveport, Louisiana, who entered the &quot;Boy of the Year&quot; competition in the late 1960s at the national Boys Clubs competition.

Stone was a supporter of The Napoleon Hill Foundation, which he directed for forty years, and to which his estate contributes funding. Stone celebrated his 100th birthday with a gift of $100,000 to the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Stone provided much of the initial funding for the self-help organization, GROW. Stone was inducted into the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, and was a Freemason.

W. Clement Stone once stated, &quot;Regardless of what you are or what you have been, you can still become what you may want to be.&quot;

== Other ==
In 1969 and 1970, Stone served as a Republican member of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees, having been appointed to fill the vacancy left by the death in office of Harold A. Pogue. In 1970, Stone ran unsuccessfully for reelection as a trustee.

In 1973, Stone was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree from Whittier College.

<doc id="390789" wikidata="Q1061313" url="?curid=390789" title="Sutherland">
<text>Sutherland () is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area in the Highlands of Scotland. The name dates from the Viking era when the area was ruled by the Jarl of Orkney; although Sutherland includes some of the northernmost land on the island of Great Britain, it was called &quot;&quot; (&quot;southern land&quot;) from the standpoint of Orkney and Caithness.

From the 13th century, Sutherland was a provincial lordship, being an earldom controlled by the Earl of Sutherland. The earldom just covered the south-eastern part of the later county. A shire called Sutherland was created in 1633, covering the earldom of Sutherland and the neighbouring provinces of Assynt to the west and Strathnaver to the north. Shires gradually eclipsed the old provinces in administrative importance, and also become known as counties.

The county is generally rural and sparsely populated. Sutherland was particularly affected by the Highland Clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the population has been in decline since the mid-19th century. As at 2011 the population of the county was 12,803, being less than half of the peak of 25,793 which was recorded in 1851. Only one town held burgh status, being Dornoch, where the county&#x27;s courts were held. Between 1890 and 1975 Sutherland had a county council, which had its main offices in the village of Golspie.

Sutherland has a coast to the east onto the Moray Firth and a coast to the north-west onto the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the county is mountainous, and the western and northern coasts include many high sea cliffs. There are four national scenic areas wholly or partly in the county: Assynt-Coigach, North West Sutherland, Kyle of Tongue and Dornoch Firth, with the first three of these lying along the western and northern coasts.

The county ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975, when the area became part of the Highland region, which in turn became a single-tier council area in 1996. There was a local government district called Sutherland from 1975 to 1996, which was a lower-tier district within the Highland region, covering a similar but not identical area to the pre-1975 county. The pre-1975 county boundaries are still used for certain functions, being a registration county. The neighbouring counties prior to the 1975 reforms were Caithness to the north-east and Ross and Cromarty to the south.

The Sutherland lieutenancy area was redefined in 1975 to be the local government district. The registration county and the lieutenancy area therefore have slightly different definitions; the registration county does not include Kincardine, but the lieutenancy area does.

==History==
In Gaelic, the area is referred to according to its traditional areas: &#x27; (or &#x27;) (MacAoidh&#x27;s country) in the north (also known in English as Mackay Country), &#x27; (Assynt) in the west, and &#x27; in the east. &quot;&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to the area as a whole.

Much of the area that would become Sutherland was anciently part of the Pictish kingdom of Cat, which also included Caithness. It was conquered in the 9th century by Sigurd Eysteinsson, Jarl of Orkney. The Jarls owed allegiance to the Norwegian crown. It is possible that Sigurd may have taken Ross to the south as well, but by the time of his death in 892 the southern limit of his territory appears to have been the River Oykel. The Scottish crown claimed the overlordship of the Caithness and Sutherland area from Norway in 1098. The Earls of Orkney thereafter owed allegiance to the Scottish crown for their territory on the mainland, which they held as the Mormaer of Caithness, but owed allegiance to the Norwegian crown for Orkney.
The Diocese of Caithness was established in the 12th century. The bishop&#x27;s seat was initially at Halkirk, but in the early 13th century was moved to Dornoch Cathedral, which was begun in 1224. Around the same time, a new earldom of Sutherland was created from the southern part of the old joint earldom of Orkney and Caithness.

In terms of shires (areas where justice was administered by a sheriff), the north of mainland Scotland was all included in the shire of Inverness from the 12th century. An act of parliament in 1504 acknowledged that the shire of Inverness was too big for the effective administration of justice, and so declared Ross and Caithness to be separate shires. The boundary used for the shire of Caithness created in 1504 was the diocese of Caithness, which included Sutherland. The Sheriff of Caithness was directed to hold courts at either Dornoch or Wick. That act was set aside for most purposes in 1509, and Caithness (including Sutherland) once more came under the sheriff of Inverness.

In 1633 a new shire called Sutherland was created. It covered the earldom of Sutherland plus the provincial lordships of Strathnaver on the north coast and Assynt on the west coast. Dornoch was declared to be the head burgh of the new shire. The position of Sheriff of Sutherland was a hereditary one, held by the Earls of Sutherland.

Over time, Scotland&#x27;s shires became more significant than the old provinces, with more administrative functions being given to the sheriffs. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were established for each shire, which would serve as the main administrative body for the area until the creation of county councils in 1890. Following the Acts of Union in 1707, the English term &#x27;county&#x27; came to be used interchangeably with the older term &#x27;shire&#x27;.
Following the Jacobite rising of 1745, the government passed the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746, returning the appointment of sheriffs to the crown in those cases where they had become hereditary positions, as had been the case in Sutherland. From 1748 the government merged the positions of Sheriff of Sutherland and Sheriff of Caithness into a single post. Although they shared a sheriff after 1748, Caithness and Sutherland remained legally separate counties, having their own commissioners of supply and, from 1794, their own lord lieutenants.

The sheriff courts for Sutherland were held at Dornoch Castle until 1850, when they moved to the purpose-built Dornoch Sheriff Court, also known as &#x27;County Buildings&#x27;, which also served as the meeting place for the Sutherland Commissioners of Supply.

===Highland Clearances===
Sutherland, like other parts of the Highlands, was affected by the Highland Clearances, the eviction of tenants from their homes and/or associated farmland in the 18th and 19th centuries century by the landowners. Typically, this was to make way for large sheep farms. The Sutherland Estate (consisting of about two thirds of the county) had the largest scale clearances that occurred in the Highlands, much of this being carried out in 1812, 1814 and 1819–20. In this last period (the largest of the three listed), 1,068 families were evicted: representing an estimated 5,400 people. This population was provided with resettlement in coastal areas, with employment available in fishing or other industries. However, many instead moved to farms in Caithness or left Scotland to emigrate to Canada, the US or Australia. The population has continued to decline since the mid-19th century.

One effect of the clearances was that it concentrated Gaelic speakers in the newly created fishing villages, so extending the survival of the language in these communities. The area on Sutherland&#x27;s east coast around Golspie, Brora and Embo had its own dialect, East Sutherland Gaelic. This was the last area on the east coast of Scotland where a Gaelic dialect was commonly spoken. Work by the linguist Nancy Dorian from the 1960s onwards studied the gradual decline of East Sutherland Gaelic. The last known native speaker of the dialect died in 2020.

===County council===
Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners of supply (which were eventually abolished in 1930). The first provisional meeting of the council was held on 13 February 1890 at the County Buildings in Dornoch, but it was decided that a more accessible location was needed for the council&#x27;s meetings. Although Dornoch was the county&#x27;s only burgh, it was in the extreme south-eastern corner of the county and lay some seven miles from its then nearest railway station at The Mound. The council&#x27;s first official meeting was held on 22 May 1890 at Bonar Bridge, and subsequent meetings were generally held in Lairg, with occasional meetings in other places, including Dornoch, Golspie, Brora and Lochinver.
Although the county council generally met in Lairg, from its creation in 1890 the county council&#x27;s clerk was based in Golspie, and in 1892 the council moved its main administrative offices to a new building on Main Street in Golspie called County Offices, initially sharing the building with the village post office.

The 1889 Act also led to a review of boundaries, with parish and county boundaries being adjusted to eliminate cases where parishes straddled county boundaries. The parish of Reay had straddled Sutherland and Caithness prior to the act; the county boundary was retained, but the part of Reay parish in Sutherland was transferred to the parish of Farr in 1891.

===Since 1975===

Local government was reformed in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Sutherland became part of the Highland Region. At the district level, most of Sutherland was included in the Sutherland District. The differences between the post-1975 district and the pre-1975 county were that the district excluded the parishes of Farr and Tongue (which both went to the Caithness district), but included the parish of Kincardine from Ross and Cromarty. The transfer of Farr and Tongue to Caithness district was not popular; less than two years later, in 1977, they were transferred to the Sutherland district, after which the border between the Sutherland and Caithness districts followed the pre-1975 county boundary.

As part of the 1975 reforms, the area served by the Lord Lieutenant of Sutherland was redefined to be the new district, having previously been the county.

Sutherland District Council was based at the former county council&#x27;s headquarters at the County Offices in Golspie. Throughout the district&#x27;s existence from 1975 to 1996, a majority of the seats were held by independent councillors.
Further local government reforms in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the regions and districts created in 1975 abolished and replaced with single-tier council areas. The former Highland region became one of the new council areas. The Sutherland lieutenancy area continues to be defined as the area of the pre-1996 district, despite the abolition of the district itself. The boundaries of the historic county (as it was following the 1891 boundary changes) are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.

The Highland Council has an area committee called the Sutherland County Committee, comprising the councillors representing the wards which approximately cover the Sutherland area. The council also marks some of the historic county boundaries with road signs.

==Geography==
Much of the population of approximately 13,000 inhabitants are situated in small coastal communities, such as Helmsdale and Lochinver, which until very recently made much of their living from the rich fishing of the waters around the British Isles. Much of Sutherland is poor relative to the rest of the UK, with few job opportunities beyond government-funded employment, agriculture and seasonal tourism. Further education is provided by North Highland College, part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, which has campuses in Dornoch.

The inland landscape is rugged and very sparsely populated. Despite being Scotland&#x27;s fifth-largest county in terms of area, it has a smaller population than a medium-size Lowland Scottish town. It stretches from the Atlantic in the west, up to the Pentland Firth and across to the North Sea in the east. The west and north coasts have very high sea cliffs and deep sea lochs. The east coast contains the sea lochs of Loch Fleet and Dornoch Firth. Cape Wrath is the most north-westerly point in Scotland. Several peninsulas can be found along the north and west coasts, most notably Strathy Point, A&#x27; Mhòine, Durness/Faraid Head (the latter two formed by the Kyle of Durness, Loch Eriboll and the Kyle of Tongue), Ceathramh Garbh (formed by Loch Laxford and Loch Inchard), and Stoer Head. The county has numerous beaches, a remote example being Sandwood Bay, which can only be reached by foot along a rough track.

Sutherland has many rugged mountains such as Ben Hope, the most northerly Munro, and Ben More Assynt, the tallest peak in the county at 998 m (3,274 ft). The western part comprises Torridonian sandstone underlain by Lewisian gneiss. The spectacular scenery has been created by denudation to form isolated sandstone peaks such as Foinaven, Arkle, Cùl Mòr and Suilven. Such mountains are attractive for hill walking and scrambling, despite their remote location. Together with similar peaks to the south in Wester Ross, such as Stac Pollaidh, they have a unique structure with great scope for exploration. On the other hand, care is needed when bad weather occurs owing to their isolation and the risks of injury.

The county contains numerous lochs, some of which have been enlarged to serve as reservoirs. The larger inland lochs are:

*Loch Assynt
*Loch Choire
*Loch Hope
*Loch Loyal
*Loch Meadie
*Loch More
*Loch Naver
*Loch Shin
Owing to its isolation from the rest of the country, Sutherland was reputedly the last haunt of the native wolf, the last survivor being shot in the 18th century. However, other wildlife has survived, including the golden eagle, sea eagle and pine marten amongst other species which are very rare in the rest of the country. There are pockets of the native Scots Pine, remnants of the original Caledonian Forest.

The importance of the county&#x27;s scenery is recognised by the fact that four of Scotland&#x27;s forty national scenic areas (NSAs) are located here. The purpose of the NSA designation is to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The areas protected by the designation are considered to represent the type of scenic beauty &quot;popularly associated with Scotland and for which it is renowned&quot;. The four NSAs within Sutherland are:

* The Assynt-Coigach NSA has many distinctively shaped mountains, including Quinag, Canisp, Suilven, Cùl Mòr, Stac Pollaidh and Ben More Assynt, that rise steeply from the surrounding &quot;cnoc and lochan&quot; scenery. These can often appear higher than their actual height would indicate due to their steep sides and the contrast with the moorland from which they rise. Assynt lies within Sutherland, whilst Coigach lies within Ross and Cromarty.
* The Dornoch Firth NSA also straddles the boundary between Sutherland and Ross and Cromarty, and covers a variety of landscapes surrounding the narrow and sinuous firth.
* The Kyle of Tongue NSA covers the mountains of Ben Hope and Ben Loyal, as well as woodlands and crofting settlements on the shoreline of the kyle itself.
* The North West Sutherland NSA covers the mountains of Foinaven, Arkle and Ben Stack as well as the coastal scenery surrounding Loch Laxford and Handa Island.

Sutherland includes numerous small islands, generally lying close to the coast of the mainland. None are now inhabited, although some formerly were, notably including Eilean Hoan in Loch Eriboll, Eilean nan Ròn off the north coast near Skerray, and Handa Island in Eddrachillis Bay.

==Population==

The parishes which make up the registration county (being the pre-1975 county) had a population of 12,803 at the 2011 census. The Sutherland lieutenancy area (additionally including Kincardine) had a population of 13,451.

The population peaked at just under 26,000 in the 1851 census, but has been in decline since then.

==Transport==
The A9 road main east coast road is challenging north of Helmsdale, particularly at the notorious Berriedale Braes, and there are few inland roads. The Far North Line north-south single-track railway line was extended through Sutherland by the Highland Railway between 1868 and 1871. It enters Sutherland near Invershin and runs along the east coast as far as possible, but an inland diversion was necessary from Helmsdale along the Strath of Kildonan. The line exits to the east of Forsinard.

Helmsdale on the east coast is on the A9 road, at a junction with the A897, and has a railway station on the Far North Line. Buses operate about every two hours Mondays-Saturdays and infrequently on Sundays from Helmsdale to Brora, Golspie, Dornoch, Tain and Inverness in the south, and Berriedale, Dunbeath, Halkirk, Thurso and Scrabster in the north. These are on route X99 and are operated by Stagecoach Group, but tickets can be bought on the Citylink website. Various other Stagecoach buses link the other towns of eastern Sutherland, such as Lairg and Bonar Bridge to Tain and Inverness. The western areas of the county are less well served by public transport, however the Far North Bus company does provided scheduled services connecting Durness to Lairg (bus 806), and from Durness to Thurso via the towns of the north Sutherland coast (bus 803).

There are no commercial airports in the county. There is a small general aviation airstrip south of Dornoch, the former RAF Dornoch, which sees little traffic.

==Civil parishes==
Parishes existed from medieval times. From 1845 to 1894 they had parish boards and from 1894 to 1930 they had parish councils. They have had no administrative functions since 1930, but continue to be used for the presentation of statistics.

Following the 1891 parish boundary changes, Sutherland contained the following civil parishes:
*Assynt
*Clyne
*Creich
*Dornoch (included burgh of same name)
*Durness
*Eddrachillis
*Farr
*Golspie
*Kildonan
*Lairg
*Loth
*Rogart
*Tongue
Eddrachillis and Tongue were formerly part of Durness parish, being separated in 1724. The other eleven parishes are ancient in origin.

=== Community councils ===
Community councils were created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. They have no statutory powers, but serve as a representative body for their communities. The Highland Council designates community council areas, but a community council is only formed if there is sufficient interest from the residents. Following a review in 2019, Sutherland comprised the following communities, all of which have community councils as at 2024:

*Ardgay and District
*Assynt
*Bettyhill, Strathnaver and Altnaharra
*Brora
*Creich
*Dornoch
*Durness
*Helmsdale
*Golspie
*Kinlochbervie
*Lairg
*Melvich
*Rogart
*Scourie
*Strathy and Armadale
*Tongue
==Settlements==

== Constituency ==
The Sutherland constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom represented the county from 1708 to 1918. The constituency excluded the burgh of Dornoch, which was represented as a component of the Northern Burghs constituency. In 1918 the Sutherland constituency and Dornoch were merged into the then new constituency of Caithness and Sutherland. In 1997 Caithness and Sutherland was merged into Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross.

The Scottish Parliament constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross was created in 1999 for the newly established parliament. The constituency was extended for the 2011 election to include more of Ross-shire, and was so renamed Caithness, Sutherland and Ross. In the Scottish Parliament, Sutherland is represented also as part of the Highlands and Islands electoral region.

==Flag==

In 2018 a flag was adopted for Sutherland, following a competition organised by the Lord Lieutenant of Sutherland. The winning design has black lines on a white background, arranged as an overlapping saltire and Nordic cross, representing combined Scottish and Norwegian heritage. A gold star representing the sun is formed where the lines intersect.

==Sutherland in popular culture==

In M. C. Beaton&#x27;s Hamish Macbeth mystery series, the fictional towns of Lochdubh and Strathbane are located in Sutherland.

Rosamunde Pilcher&#x27;s last novel &quot;Winter Solstice&quot; is largely set in and around the fictional Sutherland town of Creagan, located in the Sutherland town of Dornoch.

The ship captained by Horatio Hornblower in C. S. Forester’s book &quot;A Ship of the Line&quot; is called HMS &quot;Sutherland&quot;.

The short story &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; by Neil Gaiman is set in Sutherland, and includes a discussion on the origin of the name.

It is still common to refer to the entire Gaelic-speaking world with the phrase &quot;Ó Chataibh go Cléire&quot; (from Sutherland to Cape Clear) or &quot;Ó Chataibh go Ciarraí&quot; (from Sutherland to Kerry). Cléire and Ciarraí are Gaelic-speaking regions in the far south-west of Ireland.

<text>Ciskei ( , meaning &quot;on this side of [the river] Kei&quot;), officially the Republic of Ciskei (), was a Bantustan for the Xhosa people, located in the southeast of South Africa. It covered an area of , almost entirely surrounded by what was then the Cape Province, and possessed a small coastline along the shore of the Indian Ocean.

Under South Africa&#x27;s policy of apartheid, land was set aside for black peoples in self-governing territories. Ciskei was designated as one of two homelands, or &quot;Bantustans&quot;, for Xhosa-speaking people.

Xhosa people were forcibly resettled in the Ciskei and Transkei, the other Xhosa homeland.

In contrast to the Transkei, which was largely contiguous and deeply rural, and governed by hereditary chiefs, the area that became the Ciskei had initially been made up of a patchwork of &quot;reserves&quot;, interspersed with pockets of white-owned farms. In Ciskei, there were elected headmen and a relatively educated working-class populace, but there was a tendency of the region&#x27;s black residents—who often worked in East London, Queenstown, and King Williams Town—to oppose traditional methods of control. These differences have been posited as the reason for two separate homelands for the Xhosa people being developed, as well as the later nominal independence of Ciskei from South Africa, than Transkei.

After its creation, large numbers of blacks, in particular, &quot;non-productive Bantus&quot;—women with dependent children, the elderly, and the infirm—were expelled by the apartheid government from designated white areas in the Cape Province to Ciskei, and it was also treated as a reservoir of cheap black labour. The diaspora of the Ciskei Xhosa was due to the settler colonialism and internal wars between the Xhosa.

Ciskei had a succession of capitals during its existence. Originally, Zwelitsha served as the capital, with the view that Alice would become the long-term national capital. However, it was Bisho (now spelled &quot;Bhisho&quot;) that became the capital until Ciskei&#x27;s reintegration into South Africa.

==History==
By the time Sir John Cradock was appointed governor of the Cape Colony in 1811, the Zuurveld region had lapsed into disorder, and many white farmers had begun abandoning their farms. Early during 1812, on the instructions of the governor, Lieutenant-Colonel John Graham forced 20,000 Xhosa to cross the Fish River. Subsequently, 27 military posts were erected across this border, which resulted in the establishment of the garrison towns of Grahamstown and Cradock.

At the end of the 19th century, the area known as British Kaffraria between the Fish and Kei rivers had been set aside for the &quot;Bantu&quot;, and was known as the Ciskei from then on. Europeans gave the name &quot;Ciskei&quot; to the area to distinguish it from the &quot;Transkei&quot;, the area north of the Kei.

After the Union of South Africa formed in 1910, the &quot;Bantu&quot; rights of occupation remained unclear, and differed from colony to colony within South Africa. The Native Lands Act of 1913 demarcated the reserves in the Union, and made it illegal to sell or lease these lands to Europeans (except in the Cape Colony). General Hertzog pursued his segregation policy, and subsequently passed the Native Trust and Land Act in 1936. This act effectively abolished the right of the Cape &quot;Bantu&quot; to buy land outside of the existing reserves.

The boundaries of the Ciskei region changed as land was added and excised. A notable excision was the removal of the Glen Grey and Herschel Districts, and their allocation to the newly independent Transkei, with the populations of the districts moving into the rest of Ciskei to retain their South African citizenship (which was subsequently lost when Ciskei became independent).

By the 1970s, the South African government decided on the final boundaries of Ciskei, as a consolidated area, through the amalgamation of existing reserves allocated to Ciskei, and the purchase of intervening white-owned land. This amalgamation reduced the total length of Ciskei&#x27;s borders, making them easier for the South African government to police, as well being an attempt to create a more viable area for the homeland.

==Independence==
In 1961, Ciskei became a separate administrative region, and in 1972, was declared self-governing under the rule of Chief Justice Mabandla, who was then followed by Lennox Sebe. Mabandla was a Fengu, a group that had allied itself with the British in the frontier wars, and were better educated as a result of historically embracing colonial education. Further embittered by the policies of &quot;retribalisation&quot; by the apartheid authorities, the Rharhabe became resentful, and asserted their position, which culminated in the election of Sebe—although Sebe later abandoned his anti-Fengu rhetoric.

In 1978, it became a single-party state under the rule of Sebe. In 1981, following an independence referendum in 1980, it became the fourth homeland to be declared independent by the South African government, and its residents lost their South African citizenship. However, there were no border controls between South Africa and Ciskei.

Black people who were found to be living without permits in white areas or farms in South Africa, often for generations, were forcibly relocated to Ciskei by apartheid authorities, generally from &quot;black spots&quot; in the neighbouring &quot;white corridor&quot;, and moved into squalid resettlement camps. A 1983 study by Rhodes University found that 40% of the children in one camp suffered from wasting caused by malnutrition, and 10% suffered from kwashiorkor. In another camp at Thornhill, 50% of the children died before the age of 5. Typhoid epidemics also broke out in the resettlement camps, which were often isolated, located far from urban areas, and lacked health facilities, sanitation, and schools. The forced relocations of blacks to the Ciskei resulted in high population densities in the homeland, a situation that persists to the present day.

On several occasions, the Ciskei government imposed collective punishment on communities that opposed its rule, and people fled the Bantustan back into South Africa proper, because of the harassment and denial of government services to dissenters.

In common with other Bantustans, its independence was not recognised by the international community. Sebe once claimed that the State of Israel had granted official recognition to Ciskei, but the Israeli Foreign Ministry denied this.

===Ciskei–Transkei hostilities and &quot;Operation Katzen&quot;===

In 1986 and 1987, Transkei, a larger, wealthier, and more populous entity, undertook a series of military raids on Ciskei, and attempted to seize control of Ciskei. One of these raids was an attack on leader Lennox Sebe&#x27;s compound, with the apparent goal of taking him hostage, in order to force a merger of the two Bantustans. Transkei had previously granted sanctuary to Lennox Sebe&#x27;s estranged brother, Charles, the former head of Ciskei&#x27;s security forces, who had been imprisoned in Ciskei on charges of sedition, in addition to previously kidnapping Lennox Sebe&#x27;s son. The South African government ostensibly intervened to warn the Transkei government off. However, during a later meeting of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it was revealed that the plan to amalgamate the Transkei and Ciskei into a proposed &quot;Xhosaland&quot;, as well as the freeing of Charles Sebe from prison, had been carried out by South African security forces linked to the Civil Cooperation Bureau, in order to consolidate an anti-ANC front in the Eastern Cape region, as part of the abortive &quot;Operation Katzen&quot;.

==Coup d&#x27;état==

In 1990, Brigadier Oupa Gqozo deposed Sebe and ruled as a dictator—despite an initial promise of a swift return to civilian rule. During 1991 and 1992, many of the legal foundations of apartheid in South Africa were removed, undermining the rationale for the homelands&#x27; continued existence. The African National Congress pressed strongly for them to be reincorporated into South Africa. This was opposed by Gqozo and the other homeland leaders.

===Bisho massacre===

On 7 September 1992, the Ciskei Defence Force fired into a crowd of ANC members (led by Ronnie Kasrils, Cyril Ramaphosa, and Chris Hani) who demanded the reincorporation of Ciskei into South Africa. 28 people were killed, and hundreds injured in the massacre outside the sports stadium in Bisho, the small capital of Ciskei.
==Annexation==
Gqozo refused to participate in the negotiations to agree to a post-apartheid constitution for South Africa, and initially threatened to boycott the first non-racial elections. This became unsustainable, and in March 1994, Ciskei government workers went on strike for fear of losing their job security and pensions in the post-apartheid era. The police then mutinied, prompting Gqozo to resign on 22 March. The Transitional Executive Council (TEC) appointed two administrators, who took control of the homeland to ensure security until the elections could be held the following month. The TEC also blocked the South African government from deploying the paramilitary Internal Stability Unit (ISU) of the South African Police force, as the unit was suspected of fomenting violence in other parts of the country after the Ciskei military had threatened to open fire on the ISU if it entered the territory.

On 27 April 1994, Ciskei and all of the other homelands were reincorporated into South Africa, after the first post-apartheid elections. Along with Transkei, Ciskei became part of the new Eastern Cape Province, with its capital becoming the capital of the new province, and the former territory of the Ciskei forming parts of the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, the Chris Hani District Municipality, and the Amathole District Municipality—as of 2016.

==Economy==
According to historian Quinn Slobodian, Ciskei, on the suggestion of a group of economists led by South African Leon Louw -- called the “supply siders of Ciskei” by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; --, was operated as a &quot;de facto&quot; export processing zone of South Africa. Its economy was centered around the textile industry, with a majority female workforce, and was reliant on Taiwanese and Hong Kong investors, generous investor incentives by the South African government (including paying the wages of their employees, subsidizing 80% of their factories&#x27; rents, and not charging corporate tax), and repression of the labour movement.

<text>Manuel de Falla y Matheu (, 23 November 187614 November 1946) was a Spanish composer and pianist. Along with Isaac Albéniz, Francisco Tárrega, and Enrique Granados, he was one of Spain&#x27;s most important musicians of the first half of the 20th century. He has a claim to being Spain&#x27;s greatest composer of the 20th century, although the number of pieces he composed was relatively modest.

==Biography==

Falla was born Manuel María de los Dolores Falla y Matheu in Cádiz. He was the son of José María Falla, a Valencian, and María Jesús Matheu, from Catalonia.

In 1889 he continued his piano lessons with Alejandro Odero and learned the techniques of harmony and counterpoint from Enrique Broca. At age 15 he became interested in literature and journalism and founded the literary magazines &quot;El Burlón&quot; and &quot;El Cascabel&quot;.

===Madrid===

By 1900 he was living with his family in the capital, where he attended the Real Conservatorio de Música y Declamación. He studied piano with José Tragó, a colleague of Isaac Albéniz, and composition with Felip Pedrell. In 1897 he composed &quot;Melodía&quot; for cello and piano and dedicated it to Salvador Viniegra, who hosted evenings of chamber music that Falla attended. In 1899, by unanimous vote, he was awarded the first prize at the piano competition at his school of music. He premiered his first works: &quot;Romanza para violonchelo y piano&quot;, &quot;Nocturno para piano&quot;, &quot;Melodía para violonchelo y piano&quot;, &quot;Serenata andaluza para violín y piano&quot;, and &quot;Cuarteto en Sol y Mireya&quot;. That same year he started to use &quot;de&quot; with his first surname, making &quot;Manuel de Falla&quot; the name he became known as from that time on. When only the surname is used, however, the &quot;de&quot; is omitted.

In 1900 he composed his &quot;Canción para piano&quot; and various other vocal and piano pieces. He premiered his &quot;Serenata andaluza y Vals-Capricho para piano&quot; in the Ateneo de Madrid. Due to the precarious financial position of his family, he began to teach piano classes.

It was from Pedrell, during the Madrid period, that Falla became interested in the music of his native Andalusia, particularly Andalusian flamenco (specifically &quot;cante jondo&quot;), the influence of which can be strongly felt in many of his works. Among his early pieces are a number of zarzuelas like &quot;La Juana y la Petra&quot; and &quot;La casa de tócame Roque&quot;. On 12 April 1902 he premiered &quot;Los amores de la Inés&quot; in the Teatro Cómico de Madrid. The same year he met the composer Joaquín Turina and saw his &quot;Vals-Capricho&quot; y &quot;Serenata andaluza&quot; published by the Society of Authors.

The following year he composed and performed &quot;Allegro de concierto&quot; for the Madrid Royal Conservatory competition. Enrique Granados took first prize with his composition of the same title, but the Society of Authors published Falla&#x27;s works &quot;Tus ojillos negros&quot; and &quot;Nocturno&quot;. Falla then began his collaboration with composer Amadeo Vives on the zarzuelas &quot;Prisionero de guerra&quot;, &quot;El cornetín de órdenes&quot; and &quot;La cruz de Malta&quot; (only fragments of these works survive).

His first important work was the one-act opera &quot;La vida breve&quot; (&quot;Life is Short&quot;, or &quot;The Brief Life&quot;, written in 1905, though revised before its premiere in 1913). With a libretto by Carlos Fernández Shaw, &quot;La vida breve&quot; won Falla first prize in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando musical competition, with a prize of 2500 pesetas and a promise of a production at the Teatro Royal in Madrid—a pledge which unfortunately was not fulfilled In April 1905 he won the first prize in a piano competition sponsored by the firm of Ortiz and Cussó. On 15 May his work &quot;Allegro de concierto&quot; premiered at the Ateneo de Madrid and on 13 November the Real Academia presented him with his prize for &quot;La vida breve&quot;.

===Paris===
Falla moved to Paris in 1907, where he remained for seven years. There he met a number of composers who had an influence on his style, including Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy and Paul Dukas, as well as Igor Stravinsky, Florent Schmitt, Isaac Albéniz and the impresario Sergei Diaghilev. In 1908 King Alfonso XIII awarded him a royal grant that enabled him to remain in Paris while he finished his &quot;Cuatro piezas españolas&quot;. In 1910 Falla met Stravinsky and in 1911–12 traveled to London, Brussels and Milan to give concerts and investigate possible venues for &quot;La vida breve&quot;, which he had composed shortly after his arrival in Paris in 1907 but which, despite the support of Dukas and Falla&#x27;s own best efforts, was not finally performed until 1 April 1913 at the Municipal Casino in Nice, with the libretto translated into French by the dramatist Paul Milliet. A second production was given the following year at the Opéra-Comique, to acclaim from critics such as Pierre Lalo and André Coeuroy. He wrote &quot;Siete canciones populares españolas&quot;, which he finished in mid-1914. Shortly after, World War I began, forcing Falla to return to Madrid. While at no stage was he a prolific composer, it was then that he entered into his mature creative period.
===Return to Madrid===
In Madrid he composed several of his best-known pieces, including:
* The nocturne for piano and orchestra &quot;Noches en los jardines de España&quot; (1916)
* The ballet &quot;El amor brujo&quot; (1915) which includes the much excerpted and arranged &quot;Danza ritual del fuego&quot;
* The ballet &quot;The Magistrate and the Miller&#x27;s Wife&quot; (&quot;El corregidor y la molinera&quot;) which, after revision, became &quot;El sombrero de tres picos&quot; (1917) and was produced by Serge Diaghilev with set design and costumes by Pablo Picasso. It derives from &quot;The Three-Cornered Hat&quot; (1874), a novel written by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón.

===Granada period===

From 1921 to 1939 Manuel de Falla lived in Granada, where he organized the Concurso de Cante Jondo in 1922. In Granada he wrote the puppet opera &quot;El retablo de maese Pedro&quot; (&quot;Master Peter&#x27;s Puppet Show&quot;, 1923) and a concerto for harpsichord and chamber ensemble (&quot;Harpsichord Concerto&quot;, 1926). The puppet opera marked the first time Falla included the harpsichord in his orchestra. Both of these works were written with Wanda Landowska in mind. In these works, the Spanish folk influence is somewhat less apparent than a kind of Stravinskian neoclassicism.

During the 1920s and 1930s, he frequently visited Barcelona and Catalonia and became associated with various Catalan artists, critics and intellectuals, such as Joan Lamote de Grignon, Oleguer Junyent, Frank Marshall, Rafael Moragas, Jaume Pahissa and Santiago Rusiñol. He showed great interest in the sound of the cobla and attended several concerts of the Cobla Barcelona. He also collaborated with various Catalan institutions, such as the Associació de Música Da Camera, the Banda Municipal de Barcelona or the Orquestra Pau Casals, with whom he premiered the &quot;Concerto for clave&quot; with Wanda Landowska. In 1925, after an honorary banquet held at the Hotel Majestic, Falla said: «I have to tell you, and I say it with all my soul, that, without the Catalans, I might not have been able to carry out my work, or to be who I am».

Also in Granada, Falla began work on the large-scale orchestral cantata &quot;Atlántida&quot; (&quot;Atlantis&quot;), based on the Catalan text &quot;L&#x27;Atlàntida&quot; by Jacint Verdaguer.
===Argentina===
Falla continued work on &quot;Atlántida&quot; after moving to Argentina in 1939, following Francisco Franco&#x27;s victory in the Spanish Civil War. The orchestration of the piece remained incomplete at his death and was completed posthumously by Ernesto Halffter. He also premiered his &quot;Suite Homenajes&quot; in Buenos Aires in November 1939. In 1940, he was named a Knight of the Order of King Alfonso X of Castile. Franco&#x27;s government offered him a large pension if he would return to Spain, but he refused.

Falla did spend some time teaching in exile. Among his notable pupils was composer Rosa García Ascot. His health began to decline and he moved to a house in the mountains where he was tended by his sister María del Carmen de Falla (1882–1971). He died of cardiac arrest on 14 November 1946 in Alta Gracia, in the Argentine province of Córdoba, 9 days before his 70th birthday. He had left in writing that he wanted to be buried in the Sierras de Córdoba in Argentina. The Spanish Embassy of Francisco Franco took charge of his possessions when the family decided to bring him back to Spain. In 1947 his remains were brought back to Spain and entombed in the Cádiz Cathedral. One of the lasting honors to his memory is the Manuel de Falla Chair of Music in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at Complutense University of Madrid. Manuel de Falla never married and had no children.

== Legacy ==
Falla&#x27;s home in Granada was a villa overlooking the city which has been preserved as a biographical museum.
In the 1970s a concert hall, the Auditorio Manuel de Falla, was built on an adjacent site. The hall opened with a concert of works by Falla. It has since become the home of the City of Granada Orchestra.

His image appeared on the Spanish 1970 100-pesetas banknote.

A station on Madrid Metro&#x27;s Line 10 is named after him.

<text>Terry Farrell (born November 19, 1963) is an American actress and fashion model. She is best known for her roles as Jadzia Dax in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and as Regina &quot;Reggie&quot; Kostas in the comedy series &quot;Becker&quot;.

==Early life==
Farrell was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

In her junior year of high school, Farrell submitted her image to the Elite modeling agency in New York City. Shortly after, at the age of 16, she was invited to New York City and, within two days of arriving, had an exclusive contract with &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;. She went on to appear on the covers of the Italian and German editions of &quot;Vogue&quot;, and was also featured in numerous editorials for American &quot;Vogue&quot;.

==Career==

After 18 months of modeling, she studied acting while still modeling on the side. Her first major roles were in the short-lived 1984 television series &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;, playing a model, and in the feature film &quot;Back to School&quot; (in her film debut) with Rodney Dangerfield, playing love interest to Keith Gordon’s character. In 1986, Farrell appeared in an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot;

In 1989, she began studying acting with Stella Adler and appeared in a number of guest-starring roles in series, including &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; and &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. In 1992, she played Cat in a second pilot for a U.S. version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, which was not picked up.

Soon after the &quot;Red Dwarf USA&quot; project folded, she was offered a lead role in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Farrell starred as Jadzia Dax, the space station&#x27;s Starfleet science officer, a character from an alien species known as the Trill, who is host to a 300-year-old symbiont, and can draw upon the memories and knowledge of the symbiont&#x27;s seven previous hosts. The series debuted in January 1993. When she left the show at the end of the sixth season, Paramount killed off Farrell&#x27;s &quot;host&quot; character (though continuing the &quot;symbiont&quot; character in a new Dax host, played by Nicole DeBoer).
Farrell then co-starred on Paramount&#x27;s television comedy series &quot;Becker&quot;. She played Regina &quot;Reggie&quot; Kostas, foil and love interest to Ted Danson&#x27;s John Becker, for four years and 94 episodes, before her character was written out of the show. Farrell told the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; that she was fired from the show just after the season-four cliffhanger finale aired. She told the paper that she was completely surprised by the firing.

Farrell also provided the voice of Six of One in the animated short film &quot;Tripping the Rift&quot;, which eventually became a Sci-Fi Channel TV series with other actors providing the voice of Six. First released independently on the Internet, &quot;Tripping the Rift&quot; originally featured Patricia Beckmann as the voice of Six and was replaced by Farrell&#x27;s voice for an episode of the Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s short film series &quot;Exposure&quot;, in which Farrell was guest host. Farrell&#x27;s version of Six was heard only once on television.

Farrell retired in 2002 after marrying actor Brian Baker. They divorced in 2015, and Farrell played a role in the web-released fan film &quot;Star Trek: Renegades&quot;. She is expected to appear in the same role in episodes of &quot;Renegades&quot;, which strips mention of &quot;Star Trek&quot; for legal purposes.

==Personal life==
Farrell retired from acting to concentrate on her family. She lived in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with her husband, former Sprint Corporation spokesman Brian Baker and their son. She enjoys sewing and yoga. Farrell appeared with Baker at the Hershey Area Playhouse in Hershey, in a production of A.R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;Love Letters&quot;. Farrell and Baker have been divorced since December 2015.

In August 2015, she was reportedly in a relationship with Adam Nimoy and Farrell confirmed on Twitter that they were engaged. Farrell and Nimoy were married in San Francisco on March 26, 2018, Leonard Nimoy&#x27;s 87th birthday. An August 28, 2024, &quot;LA Times&quot; interview with Nimoy called the marriage &quot;brief,&quot; and Nimoy confirmed that it had ended.

Farrell and her &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; co-star Nana Visitor were honored in 2001 when William Kwong Yu Yeung named two small Solar System bodies he had discovered after them – asteroid 26,734 (Terryfarrell) and asteroid 26,733 (Nanavisitor).

<doc id="390809" wikidata="Q8047957" url="?curid=390809" title="Yamate">
<text>is the name of a historic neighbourhood in Naka-ku, Yokohama often referred to in English as &quot;The Bluff.&quot; The neighbourhood is famous as having been a foreigners&#x27; residential area in the Bakumatsu, Meiji and Taishō periods. While still dominantly residential in character, with views over downtown Yokohama, historic residential properties, ornamental gardens and public parks, the area is also a popular visitor destination.

==History==
When the Port of Yokohama first opened to foreign trade under the terms of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1859, the foreigner&#x27;s settlement was initially confined to a low-lying area known as Kannai. As commercial activity in the Kannai settlement rapidly outgrew the available space, construction on the elevated Yamate Bluff started in 1862. Initially a residential area for the foreign diplomatic community, one of the first structures to be built on the Bluff was the residence of the British Consul-General, Sir Rutherford Alcock.

===British Military Garrison===
From 1862 until 1875, British diplomatic and commercial interests were protected by a troop garrison stationed at Yamate at the crest of the hill overlooking the harbour, a location that now serves as Harbour View Park. After a series of attacks on the British legation at Yedo a military guard for British diplomats stationed at Yokohama was first established in 1860. In 1861 this small detachment was supplemented by Royal Marines from HMS Renard. Much larger numbers of troops of the 20th (East Devonshire) Regiment of the Foot arrived on troopship in January 1864, together with two companies of the 2nd Baloochees from the Bombay Native Infantry. A Royal Marine battalion arrived on 25 May 1864, aboard HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot;, bringing garrison troop numbers in that year to 1,700. In subsequent years these units were replaced by members of the 9th (East Norfolk),11th, 67th and the 10th (North Lincoln) Regiment of Foot.

 Contemporary maps produced in 1864 indicate that officer and troop accommodation, a naval hospital, stores facilities and a large parade ground stretched from the modern park area overlooking the harbour as far as the current location of Christ Church, Yokohama. Team sports, notably cricket and rugby union, were introduced to Japan for the first time on the parade ground by British service personnel.

Conditions in the camp varied greatly; while the wooden huts of the 20th regiment afforded greater protection from the vagaries of the weather, bell tents assigned to the Marine Battalion provided little protection against the torrential rain and humidity of the Yokohama summer. Detailed Royal Navy medical records of the period reported frequent smallpox outbreaks among the troops and that a dysentery epidemic shortly after the arrival of the Marine Battalion in the summer of 1864 claimed the lives of 11 men.

During the same period the French diplomatic mission also had a smaller detachment of troops located at a site adjacent to its own consular property. A French military hospital was also established at the foot of the Yamate hill.

==Historic Residential Properties==

Over succeeding years during the Meiji era, many senior officers of the Kannai trading companies, &quot;oyatoi gaikokujin&quot; and the diplomatic representatives of other trading nations established homes in the neighbourhood.

Although many of the original foreign resident&#x27;s accommodation and civic buildings were destroyed in the Great Kantō earthquake, a number of older Meiji and Taishō Period properties have been preserved and relocated to this neighbourhood. The buildings and their ornamental gardens are open to the public free of charge and serve as popular tourist attractions, many featuring tea rooms, art and seasonal ikebana exhibits. Current properties from the Meiji, Taishō and early Showa periods open to visitors include:

* Diplomat&#x27;s House (1910) designed for Japanese Ambassador Sadatsuchi Uchida by James McDonald Gardiner. Located adjacent to the Bluff 18 House in the Italian Garden Park.
* The Ehrismann Residence (1927) designed by Antonin Raymond
* Berrick Hall (1930) designed by Jay H. Morgan as the residence of a British trading merchant. 
* Former British Consul&#x27;s Residence (1937) located in Harbour View Park
* Yamate 111 House designed by Jay H. Morgan and the Yamate 234 house.

==Sightseeing and local landmarks==

The area features the campuses of Yokohama International School, Saint Maur International School and Ferris University. Additionally:

* Harbour View Park
* Yokohama Foreign General Cemetery established in 1859, contains graves and memorials to many prominent members of the Bakumatsu and Meiji Period foreign community. There is also a small museum on site with photographs and descriptions of individual community members and their contributions to the development of Yokohama.
* Anglican, Christ Church first established in Yamashita-cho in 1863
* Catholic, Sacred Heart Cathedral first established in Yamashita-cho in 1862
* Protestant, Yokohama Union Church, with the first worship in 1963.
* Kirin Park adjacent to the location of William Copeland&#x27;s original Spring Valley Brewery, the first beer production facility of any notable size in Japan. 
* Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club, Japan&#x27;s oldest sporting and social club founded in 1868.
* Former Negishi Racecourse. Constructed in 1866 as a replacement for the original 1862 Swamp Ground racecourse at the rear of the Kannai foreign settlement. Home to some of the earliest horse races in Japan, conducted in a recognisably European style. Horseracing came to and end at the site in 1942. Now a public park and home to a small museum of horseracing. The main grandstand designed in 1929 by American architect Jay H. Morgan is still a prominent landmark. 
* Italian Garden Park
* Gaiety Theatre Museum, built on the site of the Gaiety Theatre established in 1866.
* The Yokohama Cat Museum
* The Yokohama Tin Toys Museum

The neighborhood still maintains a reputation as an exclusive residential district today, along with the Motomachi neighborhood located at the foot of the Yamate hill.

==Transportation==
Yamate is served by Motomachi-Chūkagai Station, the terminus of the Minatomirai Line subway. Pedestrian access to and from the station and the historic properties on the Yamate ridge road is facilitated by elevators and escalators rising directly from the station on Motomachi Shopping Street to America-yama Park.

Ishikawacho Station on the JR East Negishi Line provides alternative pedestrian access to sites such as the Italian Garden Park, Bluff 18 House and Ferris University. Yamate Station, also on the JR East Negishi Line, serves the Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club and the site of the former Negishi Racecourse.

== Education==
The operates public elementary and junior high schools.

Most portions of Yamatecho are zoned to Motomachi Elementary School (元街小学校). However some portions (the following &quot;ban&quot;: 84-88, 104-176, 178, 188, and 241-245) are zoned to Kitagata Elementary School (北方小学校). The Motomachi Elementary zone and the portions of Yamatecho zoned to Kitagata Elementary are all zoned to Minato Junior High School (港中学校).

<text>Dongba (Nakhi: &quot;²dto¹mba&quot;, ) refers to both the religion and the priests of the Nakhi people of southwest China.

== Role in society ==
&quot;Dongba&quot; is believed to have originated from the indigenous Tibetan Bon religion. According to Nakhi legend, these teachings first came to Yunnan from a Bon shaman from eastern Tibet named Dongba Shilo (丁巴什罗). The strong Tibetan influence can be seen today in the rituals and costumes of the Dongba priests, who invoke Bon spirits and are often adorned with pictures of Bon gods on their headgear.

Currently, the religion is deeply ingrained in Nakhi culture, with Dongba priests serving as the primary transmitters of traditional Nakhi culture, literature and the pictographic Dongba symbols. The priests also conduct a variety of rituals to propitiate the many gods and spirits which are believed to play an active part in the natural world. The core of the Dongba religion is based on the belief that both man and nature are two half-brothers born of two mothers and the same father.

Prior to Tibetan influence, it is suggested that the original Nakhi priests were female &quot;llü-bu&quot;. At that time, statues or religious images could be widely seen everywhere.

A complete annotated translation of ancient Nashi Dongba books (), in 100 volumes, has been published.

<text>The Dongba, Tomba or Tompa or Mo-so symbols are a system of pictographic glyphs used by the &quot;²dto¹mba&quot; (Bon priests) of the Naxi people in southern China. In the Naxi language it is called &quot;²ss ³dgyu&quot; &#x27;wood records&#x27; or &quot;²lv ³dgyu&quot; &#x27;stone records&#x27;. The first artifacts with this script on them originate from approximately 30 AD.

The glyphs may be used as rebuses for abstract words which do not have glyphs. Dongba is largely a mnemonic system, and cannot by itself represent the Naxi language; different authors may use the same glyphs with different meanings, and it may be supplemented with the &quot;geba&quot; syllabary for clarification.

==Origin and development==
The Dongba script appears to be an independent ancient writing system, though presumably it was created in the environment of older scripts. According to Dongba religious fables, the Dongba script was created by the founder of the Bön religious tradition of Tibet, Tönpa Shenrab (Tibetan: &quot;ston pa gshen rab)&quot; or Shenrab Miwo (Tibetan: &quot;gshen rab mi bo),&quot; while traditional Naxi genealogies attribute the script to a 13th-century king named Móubǎo Āzōng. From Chinese historical documents, it is clear that Dongba was used as early as the 7th century, during the early Tang dynasty. By the Song dynasty in the 10th century, Dongba was widely used by the Naxi people. It continues to be used in certain areas; thus, it is the only pictographic writing system in the world still actively maintained.

Chinese historical documents referred to Naxi 納西 as Mosuo or Moso (麽些 &quot;mósuò&quot;, &quot;tiny little&quot;), The Dongba script was called Les Mo-So: Ethnographie des Mo-so Écriture by Jacques Bacot on 1913. Dongba means Priest.
After the conclusion of the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949, the use of Dongba was discouraged.

In 1957, the Chinese government implemented a Latin-based phonographic writing system for Naxi.

During the Cultural Revolution, thousands of manuscripts were destroyed. Paper and cloth writings were boiled into construction paste for building houses. About half of the Dongba manuscripts that survive today had been taken from China to the United States, Germany and Spain.

Today Dongba is nearly extinct, and the Chinese government is trying to revive it in an attempt to preserve Naxi culture.

==Usage==
The script was originally used as a prompt for the recitation of ritual texts. For inventories, contracts, and letters, the geba script was used. Milnor concludes it is &quot;unlikely that it [the Dongba script] would make the minor developmental leap to becoming a full-blown writing system. It arose a number of centuries ago to serve a particular ritual purpose. As its purpose need not expand to the realm of daily use among non-religious specialists—after all, literate Naxi today, as in the past, write in Chinese—at most it will presumably but continue to fulfill the needs of demon exorcism, amusing tourists and the like.&quot;

The script is also present in modern settings, especially in the Ancient City of Lijiang, where tourists may see Dongba used alongside Chinese and English on business signs and public spaces. This usage emphasizes its role as a cultural symbol that represents the Naxi people&#x27;s heritage.

Today, Dongba continues to be used in religious contexts, such as ceremonial chants and rituals, while also appearing in artistic and commercial forms. Dongba symbols are incorporated into local crafts, souvenirs, and artwork, providing a visual link to Naxi cultural identity. This integration supports its visibility and contributes to local cultural tourism.

==Structure and form==
Dongba is both pictographic and ideographic. There are about a thousand glyphs, but this number is fluid as new glyphs are coined. Each glyph in the Dongba script can have multiple meanings or serve various functions depending on its context. For example, a single pictogram could represent an object, an idea, or even a sequence of actions. This inherent ambiguity allows for creativity and adaptability but also means that texts are often personalized by the author’s unique use of symbols. 

Priests drew detailed pictures to record information, and illustrations were simplified and conventionalized to represent not only material objects but also abstract ideas. Glyphs are often compounded to convey the idea of a particular word. Generally, as a mnemonic, only keywords are written; a single pictograph can be recited as different phrases or an entire sentence.

Examples of Dongba rebus include using a picture of two &quot;eyes (myə3)&quot; to represent &quot;fate (myə3),&quot; a rice bowl for both &quot;xa2&quot; &#x27;food&#x27; and &quot;xa2&quot; &#x27;sleep&#x27;, and a picture of a &quot;goral (se3)&quot; stands in for an aspectual particle. It has two variants &quot;&quot; (玛里玛莎文) and &quot;/&quot; (阮坷文).

==Writing media and tools==
The Naxi name of the script, &#x27;wood and stone records&#x27;, testifies that Dongba was once carved on stone and wood. Nowadays it is written on handmade paper, typically from the trees &quot;Daphne tangutica&quot; and &quot;D. retusa.&quot; The sheets are typically 28 by 14 cm, and are sewn together at the left edge, forming a book. The pages are ruled into four horizontal lines. Glyphs are written from left to right and top to bottom. Vertical lines are used to section off elements of the text (see image above), equivalent to sentences or paragraphs. Writing utensils include bamboo pens and black ink made from ash.

<text>Endive () is a leaf vegetable belonging to the genus &quot;Cichorium&quot;, which includes several similar bitter-leafed vegetables. Species include &quot;Cichorium endivia&quot; (also called endive), &quot;Cichorium pumilum&quot; (also called wild endive), and &quot;Cichorium intybus&quot; (also called chicory). Chicory includes types such as radicchio, puntarelle, and Belgian endive.

There is considerable confusion between &quot;Cichorium endivia&quot; and &quot;Cichorium intybus&quot;.

==&quot;Cichorium endivia&quot;==
There are two main varieties of cultivated &quot;C. endivia&quot; chicon:

* Curly endive, or frisée (var. &quot;crispum&quot;). This type has narrow, green, curly outer leaves. It is sometimes called chicory in the United States and is called &quot;chicorée frisée&quot; in French. Further confusion results from the fact that frisée also refers to greens lightly wilted with oil.
* Escarole, or broad-leaved endive (var. &quot;latifolia&quot;), has broad, pale green leaves and is less bitter than the other varieties. Varieties or names include broad-leaved Batavian endive, grumolo, scarola, and scarole. It is eaten like other greens, sauteed, chopped into soups and stews, or as part of a green salad.

==&quot;Cichorium intybus&quot;==

&quot;Cichorium intybus&quot; endive is popular in Europe, and is also known as leaf chicory.
==Chemical constituents==
Endive is rich in many vitamins and minerals, especially in folate and vitamins A and K, and is high in fiber. It also contains kaempferol.

<text>A wedding cake is the traditional cake served at wedding receptions following dinner. In some parts of England, the wedding cake is served at a wedding breakfast; the &#x27;wedding breakfast&#x27; does not mean the meal will be held in the morning, but at a time following the ceremony on the same day. In modern Western culture, the cake is usually on display and served to guests at the reception. Traditionally, wedding cakes were made to bring good luck to all guests and the couple. Nowadays, however, they are more of a centerpiece to the wedding and are not always even served to the guests. Some cakes are built with only a single edible tier for the bride and groom to share, but this is rare since the cost difference between fake and real tiers is minimal.

==Basic information==
Wedding cakes come in a variety of sizes, depending on the number of guests the cake will serve. Modern pastry chefs and cake designers use various ingredients and tools to create a cake that usually reflects the personalities of the couple. Marzipan, fondant, gum paste, buttercream, and chocolate are among the popular ingredients used. Cakes range in price along with size and components. Cakes are usually priced on a per-person, or per-slice, basis. Prices can range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars per-person or slice, depending on the pastry chef who is hired to make the cake. Wedding cakes and cake decorating in general have become a certain pop culture symbol in western society. In the United States, reality television shows such as &quot;Cake Boss&quot; and &quot;Amazing Wedding Cakes&quot; have become popular and are trending in today&#x27;s popular culture.

==History==
The first wedding cakes were probably made in ancient Greece.

The contemporary wedding cake has grown out of several different ethnic traditions. One of the first traditions began in Ancient Rome, where a cake of wheat or barley was broken over the bride&#x27;s head to bring good fortune to the couple.

=== Early modern European wedding cakes ===
During the 16th century to the 17th century, the &quot;bride&#x27;s pie&quot; was served at most weddings. Different from the modern sweet wedding cake, bride pie is savoury. Bride pie is a pie with pastry crust and filled an assortment of oysters, lamb testicles, pine kernels, and cocks&#x27; combs (from Robert May&#x27;s 1685 recipe). For May&#x27;s recipe, there is a compartment of bride pie which is filled with live birds or a snake for the guests to pass the time in a wedding when they cut up the pie at the table. Guests were expected to have a piece out of politeness. It was considered very rude and bad luck not to eat the bride&#x27;s pie. One tradition of bride&#x27;s pie was to place a glass ring in the middle of the dessert and the maiden who found it would be the next to marry, similar to the modern tradition of catching the flower bouquet.

In the 17th century, two cakes were made: one for the bride and one for the groom. The groom&#x27;s cake would fall out of favour as the bride&#x27;s cake became the main cake for the event. When the two cakes were served together, the groom&#x27;s cake was typically the darker colored, rich fruit cake and generally much smaller than the bride&#x27;s cake. The bride&#x27;s cake was usually a simple pound cake with white icing because white was a sign of virginity and purity.

Wedding cake was originally a luxury item, and a sign of celebration and social status (the bigger the cake, the higher the social standing). Wedding cakes in England and early America were traditionally fruit cakes, often tiered and topped with marzipan and icing. Cutting the cake was an important part of the reception. 

In medieval England cakes were stacked as high as possible for the bride and groom to kiss over. A successful kiss meant they were guaranteed a prosperous life together. From this the Croquembouche was created. The myth behind this cake tells of a pastry chef, visiting medieval England, who witnessed their tradition of piling sweet rolls between the bride and groom, which they attempted to kiss over without knocking them all down. The pastry chef then went back to France and piled sweet rolls up into a tower to make the first Croquembouche. The modern croquembouche is still very popular in France, where it is now common to place the croquembouche tower on a bed of cake and make it a top tier. This traditional French wedding cake is built from profiteroles and given a halo of spun sugar.

In 1703, Thomas Rich, a baker&#x27;s apprentice from Ludgate Hill, fell in love with his employer&#x27;s daughter and asked her to marry him. He wanted to make an extravagant cake, so he drew on St Bride&#x27;s Church, on Fleet Street in London for inspiration.

Traditionally the bride would place a ring inside the couple&#x27;s portion of the cake to symbolize acceptance of the proposal. Bride&#x27;s pie would evolve into the bride&#x27;s cake. At this point the dessert was no longer in the form of a pie and was sweeter than its predecessor. The bride cake was traditionally a plum or fruit cake. In the mid-18th century, double icing (covering the cake first with almond icing and then with white icing) was used on bride cake. The white-iced upper surface of the bride cake was used as a platform on which all sorts of scenes and emblems could be mounted. The decoration was often at least partially three-dimensional and colourful in appearance. However, since some decorations were made with a variety of substances, sometimes the decoration or even parts of wedding cake were inedible. The myth that eating the pie would bring good luck was still common, but the glass ring slowly fell out of favor as the flower bouquet toss replaced it.

=== Modern Western approach ===
The bride&#x27;s cake would transform into the modern wedding cake we know today. In the early 19th century, sugar became easier to obtain during the time when the bride&#x27;s cakes became popular. The more refined and whiter sugars were still very expensive, so only wealthy families could afford to have a very pure white frosting. This display would show the wealth and social status of the family. When Queen Victoria used white icing on her cake it gained a new title: royal icing.

The modern wedding cake as we know it now would originate at the 1882 wedding of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany; his wedding cake was the first to actually be completely edible. Pillars between cake tiers did not begin to appear until about 20 years later. The pillars were very poorly made from broomsticks covered in icing. The tiers represented prosperity and were a status symbol because only wealthy families could afford to include them in the cake. Prince Leopold&#x27;s wedding cake was created in separate layers with very dense icing. When the icing would harden the tiers could be stacked, a groundbreaking innovation for wedding cakes at the time. Modern wedding cakes still use this method, with an added form of support with dowels imbedded in the cake to help carry the load, especially of larger cakes.

==Symbolism==

Wedding cakes have been present at wedding ceremonies for centuries. They were not always the focus of the event and often came in different forms, like pies or bread. There has always been a lot of symbolism associated with the wedding cake. The earliest known sweet wedding cake is known as a Banbury cake, which became popular in 1655.

The white color has been attached to wedding ceremonies since the Victorian era when Queen Victoria chose to wear a white lace wedding dress at her wedding to Prince Albert in 1840. Queen Victoria accentuated an existing symbol, the color white, being frequently associated with virginity and purity in Western culture. The wedding cake was originally known as the bride&#x27;s cake; therefore, the color white became common because the cake needed to reflect the bride – and the expensive ingredients that the family was able to afford, such as refined white sugar.

The cutting of the cake is a task full of symbolism.

In China, the couple begins cutting a multi-tier cake from the lowest level and gives the first pieces to their parents and other ancestors as a symbolic way of honoring their place as the foundation of the family.

==Superstitions==

The wedding cake is surrounded by superstitions. In a traditional American wedding, maidens would be invited to pull ribbons that are attached to the bottom layer of the wedding cake. Out of all the ribbons, only one contains a charm or a ring, and whoever gets the charm will be the next person to marry. In other countries, the wedding cake is broken over the bride&#x27;s head to ensure fertility and bring good fortune to the couple. Also, some people today think that eating the crumbs of the wedding cake would give them good luck because the wedding cake symbolizes happiness and good life to the newlywed couple.

There are also myths that bridesmaids have on dreaming of their future husbands. Hopeful bridesmaids would take a piece of cake home and place it under the pillow. Some bridesmaids would sleep with the pieces of cake in their left stocking and the rest under their pillows after passing the pieces of cake through the bride&#x27;s wedding ring.

In the medieval era, wedding cakes were constructed in rolls and buns that were laid on top of each other. The groom and bride would attempt to share a kiss on top of the stack of rolls to ensure fertility and have good fortune.

==Types of wedding cakes==
Different types of cakes have been popular in different countries and at different times. In some countries, such as Italy, different couples choose different types of cake, according to their preferences. In others, a single type is chosen by most people. Even when a type is preferred within a culture, the preferred type may change significantly over time. For example, the traditional wedding cake in Korea was a rice cake topped with a powder made from red beans, but now guests are likely to see a sponge cake and fresh fruit.

=== Styles ===
The typical style for a modern white wedding is a decorated white layer cake. It is usually coated and decorated with frosting. The layers may be filled with frosting, pastry cream, lemon curd, or other cake fillings. It may be topped by decorations made from frosting, with edible flowers, or with other decorations. A layer cake can be a single cake, or it can be assembled to form a tiered cake.

Very tall tiered cakes are important in Indonesia. The overall height of the cake is said to predict the couple&#x27;s prosperity.

In the US, three tiers has been the most common choice since at least the 1960s.

In Appalachia, a stack cake was a way for poorer people to celebrate potluck-style by spreading the expense across the community. A stack cake is made of thin cakes baked by different guests for the wedding. These cakes are stacked on top of each other, with the layers usually being filled with apple butter or cooked apples.

Among the Cajuns in the US, multiple cakes are baked at home by the bride&#x27;s family, rather than having one large cake.

=== Flavors ===
In the United Kingdom and Australia, the traditional wedding cake is a rich fruitcake, which is elaborately decorated with icing and may be filled with almond paste. Fruitcake was also the traditional wedding cake in the US until the middle of the 20th century.

According to the results of one survey, in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, most wedding cakes in the US were either white or yellow cakes. In the 2000s and 2010s, there was more diversity in flavors, but most of them were white or chocolate cake.

In Greece, the traditional flavor combination was honey, sesame seed, and quince. In modern Greece, an almond torte is more common. Greek wedding cakes are elaborate and even architectural, with many tiers.

In the Philippines, the cake may be a vanilla sponge cake, but it might also be a purple ube cake.

White cake is currently the most popular wedding cake flavor in the US, but different flavors of filling can be added between layers. Chocolate, carrot, Italian Rum and Italian Cream are also popular choices.

Wedding cakes based on flavor include chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry. Many modern cakes now consist of flavors such as vanilla sponge, chocolate sponge or carrot cake.

=== Groom&#x27;s cake ===
In some areas, particularly the American South, two cakes are presented at weddings. Usually, a large, white tiered cake, decorated mostly in white frosting, is called the bride&#x27;s cake, and a second flavor choice is called the &quot;groom&#x27;s cake&quot;. This tradition was brought over from England by early American colonists, who considered the white-iced bride&#x27;s cake too light for men&#x27;s tastes. The groom&#x27;s cake was usually a dark, liquor-soaked fruitcake. More recently, groom&#x27;s cakes are usually chocolate or another of his favorite flavors. The groom&#x27;s cake may be decorated or shaped as something significant to him, such as a hobby item, sports team or symbol of his occupation. The movie &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; included a red velvet groom&#x27;s cake in the shape of a giant armadillo.

Bermuda has a different tradition of two cakes. There, the bride&#x27;s cake is a three-tiered fruitcake, and the groom&#x27;s cake is a pound cake. The bride&#x27;s cake is decorated with silver and represents prosperity, and the groom&#x27;s cake is decorated with gold and represents his role as the head of the family. The groom&#x27;s cake is topped with a live cedar tree, which represents the couple&#x27;s growing love, and which the couple later plants and cares for.

When Prince William married Kate Middleton in 2011, a groom&#x27;s cake was served alongside the wedding cake at the reception. The groom&#x27;s cake was a chocolate biscuit cake based on a family recipe and McVitie&#x27;s were asked to create it.

=== Decorations ===
Tiered cakes are often separated by flowers or columns to add visual impact and height. Separators can include jewels, shells, flowers and the like or can be completely separated by using traditional chrome stands.

Fondant is a form of frosting style that is rolled out and draped over tiers. Its smooth, firm sugar icing is often embellished with appliqués, Fondant can be cut into designs, formed into shapes, flavored or tinted. Poured fondant is used to glaze petits fours and other detailed confections.

Flowerpaste or gumpaste is a pliable dough usually made from egg whites, unflavored gelatine, and powdered sugar. There are an array of methods and ingredients around the world on how to make flowerpaste and gumpaste. The purpose of this dough is typically to create flowers and other decorations for a cake. Due to the use of gum as one of the ingredients, it can be rolled very thin.

Royal icing is made with water, sugar and egg white or meringue powder. It hardens to a firm finish that can be piped or thinned for &quot;flood work&quot;, when larger sections need to be iced. It hardens fast and is ideal for making detailed shapes ahead of time. It can also be piped directly onto cake tiers and works beautifully for delicate detail work. There are a few things to consider when working with royal icing: You must use grease free utensils. Humidity also affects the consistency of royal icing. Joseph Lambeth, a well known British cake decorator, developed a technique where he creates layered scrolls using royal icing as a medium.

A wedding cake may be topped with fresh flowers. This is typical in the Philippines. 
Wedding cake toppers are models or art pieces that sit atop the cake. In the US, the most common type of cake topper features a representation of a bride and groom in wedding attire. This custom was dominant in US weddings in the 1950s, where it represented togetherness. Wedding toppers may also be figures that indicate shared hobbies or other passions, if they are used at all. Some are humorous, or may represent the couple&#x27;s hobby or occupation. In Mexico, the wedding topper and other decorations tell a story about the couple&#x27;s history.

== Alternatives ==
Instead of, or in addition to, a wedding cake, some people prefer to serve other desserts, such as pastries or cookies.

Rather than the multiple tier wedding cake, some wedding parties have stands with multiple tiers where cupcakes are placed, perhaps topped off with a small wedding cake at the top for the ceremonial cake-cutting. Being cheaper than a multi-tiered wedding cake, cupcakes also versatile in that they can have multiple flavors, colors, and designs.

Croquembouche is a complex pastry made of cream puffs and caramelized sugar. This pastry is the traditional approach to wedding cake in France.

In Norway and other Scandinavian countries, a pastry called Kransekake is the preferred approach to a wedding cake. This is often made by the family.

Kanom sam kloe is a fried pastry served at Thai weddings. Three balls of dough, made from coconuts and sesame seeds, are fried together. There are superstitions about whether the pieces of dough stay together; if they do, then this is said to portend a successful marriage and at least one child.

==After the wedding==
In Europe in the 19th century, the cakes baked to serve at the christening of an infant were similar to wedding cakes. Eventually, since the wedding cakes were generally made of fruitcake, which would store well, and because the first baby often arrived within a year or so of the wedding, it became traditional to save the top part of the wedding cake to eat in celebration of the couple&#x27;s first child. More recently, some people freeze part of the cake and save it until the couple&#x27;s first wedding anniversary.

<text>Venda ( ) or Tswetla, officially the Republic of Venda (; ), was a Bantustan in northern South Africa. It was fairly close to the South African border with Zimbabwe to the north, while, to the south and east, it shared a long border with another black homeland, Gazankulu. It is now part of the Limpopo province. Venda was founded by the South African government as a homeland for the Venda people, speakers of the Venda language. The United Nations and international community refused to recognise Venda (or any other Bantustan) as an independent state.

==History==
Venda was declared self-governing on 1 February 1973, with elections held later in the year. Further elections were held in July 1978. The territory was declared independent by the South African government on 13 September 1979, and its residents lost their South African citizenship. In common with the other Bantustans, its independence was not recognised by the international community.

Venda was initially a series of non-contiguous territories in the Transvaal, with one main part and one main exclave. Its capital, formerly at Sibasa, was moved to Thohoyandou (which included the old Sibasa administrative district) when Venda was declared independent in 1979. Prior to independence, it was expanded to form one contiguous territory, with a total land area of 6,807 km2 (2628 sq. mi.). In the 1984 elections, the ruling Venda National Party retained its position as ruling party, beating the perpetual opposition Venda Independent People&#x27;s Party (VIPP).

At independence in 1979, the population of Venda stood at about 200,000 people. The state was cut off from neighbouring Zimbabwe by the Madimbo corridor, patrolled by South African troops, to the north, and from nearby Mozambique by the Kruger National Park.

The first President of Venda, Patrick Mphephu, was also a Paramount Chief of the Vhavenda people; he was born and lived in Dzanani in Limpopo. His successor, Frank Ravele, was overthrown in a military coup by the Venda Defence Force in 1990. Afterwards, the territory was ruled by the Council of National Unity, a military junta chaired by General Gabriel Ramushwana. Venda was re-incorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994.

==Institutions of education==
In 1982, the University of Venda, known as Univen, was established as an institution of higher learning for the Vhavenda people.

==Districts in 1991==

Districts of the province and population at the 1991 census.
* Dzanani: 123,035
* Mutale: 244,532
* Thohoyandou: 136,089
* Vuwani: 55,141

==Security forces==

The Venda National Force was established with Venda&#x27;s independence in 1979 and included defence and other services such as police and prisons. Strangely enough, traffic policing was part of this national force, but, by 1981, it was transferred to the Department of Justice. The Fire Brigade was, however, still part of the Venda National Force, although there were plans to transfer this to the civilian government.

This was the 25th anniversary, or silver jubilee, of the park, and in keeping with the theme, the new season of Global Village launched on 25 October and ran for 25 weeks, concluding on 18 April 2021.

Some accommodations were made in recognition of the continuing Covid pandemic.

The 25th anniversary season was extended to 2 May so families might enjoy Ramadan in Global Village.

<text>George Wythe Randolph (March 10, 1818 – April 3, 1867) was a Virginia lawyer, planter, politician and Confederate general. After representing the City of Richmond during the Virginia Secession Convention in 1861, during eight months in 1862 he was the Confederate States Secretary of War during the American Civil War, then served in the Virginia Senate representing the City of Richmond until the war&#x27;s end.

==Early and family life==
Born in 1818 at Monticello near Charlottesville, Virginia, to Martha Jefferson Randolph, the daughter of U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, and her husband (and future Virginia governor) Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr., the couple&#x27;s youngest son could trace his descent to Pocahontas and had many relations among the First Families of Virginia. His name honored George Wythe, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, law professor of his grandfather Thomas Jefferson, and Virginia judge who opposed slavery (which position likely caused his murder). Randolph&#x27;s relations also included Edmund Randolph (Virginia&#x27;s second governor after statehood as well as the first Attorney General of the United States), colonist William Randolph, Isham Randolph of Dungeness, Richard Randolph and Thomas Randolph of Tuckahoe.

Following a private education appropriate for his class, Randolph briefly attended preparatory schools in Cambridge, Massachusetts (under the direction of his brother in law Joseph Coolidge) and Washington, D.C., where his mother sent him to give him distance from Virginia politics and family troubles. His father had incurred much debt, and creditors foreclosed after his term as Virginia&#x27;s 21st governor ended. However, his elder brother Thomas Jefferson Randolph managed to buy the family&#x27;s Edgehill plantation at a foreclosure auction in 1826. Meanwhile, G.W. Randolph became a midshipman in the United States Navy from 1831 to 1839, sailing on the &quot;USS John Adams&quot; and &quot;USS Constitution&quot; in the Mediterranean Sea as well as training at the Naval School in Norfolk, Virginia. Randolph also began attending the University of Virginia in Charlottesville near his home during his naval service in 1837, perhaps while recovering from tuberculosis contracted during his naval voyages (which went into a very long remission but which ultimately proved fatal).

Randolph read the law with an established lawyer, probably in part guided by George Tucker, who was a professor of moral philosophy at the University of Virginia (at which his eldest brother Thomas Jefferson Randolph was rector) and also wrote the first widely read biography of Thomas Jefferson (in 1837) and various treatises about economics and slavery before retiring from the faculty and moving to Philadelphia in 1845.

===Marriage and family===
On April 10, 1852, George W. Randolph married the young widow Mary Elizabeth (Adams) Pope (1830–1871). Like Randolph, she descended from the First Families of Virginia. However, they had no children. His wife Mary Randolph later became active in the Richmond Ladies Association, which organized welfare and relief for the Confederate war effort.

===Slaveholdings===

Several of the Randolphs, like Jefferson&#x27;s teacher George Wythe, opposed slavery and freed slaves either during their lifetimes or in their wills. Following Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion, his brother Thomas Jefferson Randolph introduced a gradual emancipation plan as a bill in the Virginia House of Delegates but it was soundly defeated. In the 1860 federal census, George Wythe Randolph owned one slave, a 78-year-old woman. However, like other plantations in Virginia, Edgehill plantation used slave labor.

==Career==
After admission to the bar in 1840, Randolph practiced law in Charlottesville, Virginia, and he and Mary lived at the family&#x27;s Edgehill plantation. They moved to the capital of Richmond between 1849 and 1851. Randolph became active in the community as well as continued a law practice. He founded the Richmond Mechanics&#x27; Institute and was an officer in the Virginia Historical Society.

Following John Brown&#x27;s raid at Harper&#x27;s Ferry, rumors arose that abolitionist raiders would raid the jail at Charles Town to free him. Randolph responded by organizing the Richmond Howitzers, which were among the troops that Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise sent to secure the town until Brown&#x27;s execution. On their return, they received the naval howitzers that gave their unit their name, and first paraded in Richmond on July 4, 1860. Late in 1860, they received the designation, Company H of the First Regiment of Volunteers in the Virginia militia.

As the Confederacy formed after southern states began seceding from the Union following the election of Abraham Lincoln as president, the United States divided into two hostile camps and the sections moved toward open conflict. Richmond voters elected Randolph and fellow attorneys William H. McFarland and Marmaduke Johnson (Lawyer and Soldier) as their representatives to the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861. Despite Randolph&#x27;s speech in favor of secession, the first secession vote failed (Randolph among the ayes, McFarland and Johnson among the nays). Randolph&#x27;s brother Thomas Jefferson Randolph was one of the Albemarle County delegates. A special delegation, composed of G.W. Randolph, William B. Preston and Alexander H.H. Stuart, traveled to Washington, D.C. where they met newly inaugurated President Abraham Lincoln on April 12, 1861, the same day that South Carolina artillery militia fired at Fort Sumter. Finding the President firm in his resolve to hold the Federal forts in the South, the three men returned to Richmond on April 15. On April 18, the day after President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the Confederate show of force, the Convention approved a secession resolution, which was sent for voter approval at a referendum the following month.
On April 21 Governor Wise called the Richmond Howitzers into state service and sent them down the James River to stop the &quot;USS Pawnee&quot;, allegedly en route to shell Richmond. They were then sent to barracks established at Richmond Baptist College under Col. John B. Magruder, who had fought as an artillery officer in the Mexican War and who requested ten cadets from the Virginia Military Institute as drill instructors. When enlistments proved heavy, the unit expanded into a battalion at the suggestion of Col. Edward Porter Alexander (who would later become CSA General Longstreet&#x27;s artillery commander). On May 1, 1861, Randolph accepted a commission as major and command of the Richmond Howitzers, with three companies designated (a fourth company was started in July but disbanded in August when recruitment lagged). He sent Lt. John Thomson Brown with several militiamen to Gloucester Point, where on May 7 they fired on the &quot;USS Yankee&quot;, thus the first hostile shot fired in that conflict in Virginia. On May 13, the battalion left the college and encamped on the Mechanicsville Turnpike for a while until moving to Chimborazo Hill, where they posted their guns overlooking the James River at Rockett&#x27;s Landing, where many slaves disembarked. Later in the month, First Company was sent to Manassas Junction (and returned for the battle below, but were then sent to Fairfax Court House where they were involved in a friendly fire incident on July 4, and were not actually called into action at the First Battle of Manassas, only experienced hostile fire); Second Company to Yorktown (where they joined General Magruder&#x27;s forces on May 27 and did not return, being reassigned) and Third Company to the lower Peninsula, where Randolph became General Magruder&#x27;s artillery commander and designed fortifications to secure Yorktown and the Hampton Roads area. On June 10 Randolph&#x27;s Howitzers fought the Battle of Big Bethel near Yorktown, their only engagement as a battalion during the war, and in which three men were wounded. His defenses anticipated Union General George McClellan&#x27;s campaign of the following spring.

On September 13, 1861, General Magruder organized ten artillery companies (including the Richmond Howitzers) into a regiment, with Major Randolph promoted to colonel. It was initially called the 2nd Regiment Virginia Artillery but by January 1862 became the 1st Regiment Virginia Artillery. He was promoted to brigadier general on February 12, 1862, but saw no combat as such, initially assigned to plan the defense of Suffolk. He was officially mustered out on December 18, 1864.
Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed Randolph as Secretary of War on March 18, 1862, and he took office on March 24, 1862. Randolph helped reform the department, improving procurement and writing a conscription law similar to one he had created for Virginia. He strengthened the Confederacy&#x27;s western and southern defenses, but came into conflict with Jefferson Davis. He also was involved in a controversy over the use of hidden shells, which Union troops found upon capturing Yorktown; Randolph argued the explosive devices contravened the laws of civilized warfare but were acceptable if left on a parapet of a fort to prevent its capture or allow defenders to retreat more safely. With weakening health due to tuberculosis (TB), he resigned on November 17, 1862.

However, Randolph did accept election as Richmond&#x27;s state senator, and served in the Virginia Senate during the remainder of the conflict.

==Post-Civil War==
In 1864, Randolph ran the U.S. naval blockade and took his family to Europe, receiving medical treatment in England and southern France. He took the oath of allegiance to the United States in April 1866 in Pau, France. The Randolphs then returned to Virginia. Randolph died of tuberculosis on April 3, 1867, at Edgehill. He is buried at Monticello in the Jefferson family graveyard.

<text>Benthuizen is a village in the Dutch province of South Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Alphen aan den Rijn and lies about 1 km east of Zoetermeer.

== History ==
Benthuizen was described between 1280 and 1287. Benthuizen developed as a peat excavation settlement in the Late Middle Ages.

The Dutch Reformed church is a T-shaped aisleless church which was built between 1796 and 1797. The tower dates from 1672. The church was restored and extended on the north side between 1937 and 1938.

Until 1991 Benthuizen was an independent municipality in that year the municipality became part of the larger municipality &quot;Rijneveld&quot;. In 1993 the name was changed to Rijnwoude, and in 2014 it became part of Alphen aan den Rijn.

The HSL-Zuid being constructed passes Benthuizen on the eastern side. Also the new Bentwoud (forest) is planted to the east of Benthuizen.

Benthuizen has several buildings that are officially designated monuments. One of these is the historic windmill known as &#x27;De Haas&#x27; (&#x27;The Hare&#x27;). The grist mill dates from 1772. In 1924, an electro motor was installed. Demolition of the windmill was considered several times, but in 1983 restoration began and the windmill was back in service in 1985. The windmill grinds both for human consumption and fodder.

<doc id="390846" wikidata="Q33494" url="?curid=390846" title="Martha's Vineyard Sign Language">
<text>Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL) was a village sign-language that was once widely used on the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard from the early 18th century to 1952. It was used by both deaf and hearing people in the community; consequently, deafness was not a barrier to participation in public life. Deaf people who signed Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language were extremely independent.

The language was able to thrive because of the unusually high percentage of deaf islanders and because deafness was a recessive trait, which meant that almost anyone might have both deaf and hearing siblings. In 1854, when the island&#x27;s deaf population peaked, an average of one person in 155 was deaf, while the United States national average was one in about 5,730. In the town of Chilmark, which had the highest concentration of deaf people on the island, the average was 1 in 25; at one point, in a section of Chilmark called Squibnocket, as much as 1 in 4 of the population of 60 was deaf.

Sign language on the island declined when the population migrated to the mainland. There are no fluent signers of MVSL today. Katie West, the last deaf person born into the island&#x27;s sign-language tradition, died in 1952, though there were a few elderly residents still able to recall MVSL when researchers started examining the language in the 1980s. Linguists are working to save the language, but their task is difficult because they cannot experience MVSL firsthand.

== Origins ==
Hereditary deafness had appeared on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard by 1714. The ancestry of most of the deaf population of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard can be traced to a forested area in the south of England known as the Weald—specifically the part of the Weald in the county of Kent. Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL) may be descended from a hypothesized sign language of that area in the 16th century, now referred to as Old Kent Sign Language. Families from a Puritan community in the Kentish Weald emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in British America in the early 17th century, and many of their descendants later settled on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. The first deaf person known to have settled there was Jonathan Lambert, a carpenter and farmer, who moved there with his wife—who was not deaf—in 1694. By 1710, the migration had virtually ceased, and the endogamous community that was created contained a high incidence of hereditary deafness that persisted for over 200 years.

In the town of Chilmark, which had the highest concentration of deaf people on the island, the average was 1 in 25; at one point, in a section of Chilmark called Squibnocket, as much as 1 in 4 of the population of 60 was deaf. By the 18th century there was a distinct Chilmark Sign Language. In the 19th century, this was influenced by French Sign Language, and evolved into MVSL in the 19th and 20th centuries. From the late 18th to the early 20th century, virtually everybody on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard possessed some degree of fluency in the language.

== Deaf migration to the mainland ==
In the early 19th century, a new educational philosophy began to emerge on the mainland, and the country&#x27;s first school for the deaf opened in 1817 in Hartford, Connecticut (now called the American School for the Deaf). Many of the deaf children of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard enrolled there, taking their sign language with them. The language of the teachers was French Sign Language, and many of the other deaf students used their own home-sign systems. This school became known as the birthplace of the deaf community in the United States, and the different sign systems used there, including MVSL, merged to become American Sign Language or ASL—now one of the largest community languages in the country.

As more deaf people remained on the mainland, and others who returned brought with them deaf spouses they met there (whose hearing loss may not have been due to the same hereditary cause), the line of hereditary deafness began to diminish. At the outset of the 20th century, the previously isolated community of fishers and farmers began to see an influx of tourists that would become a mainstay in the island&#x27;s economy. Jobs in tourism were not as deaf-friendly as fishing and farming had been, and as intermarriage and migration joined the people of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard to the mainland, the island community grew to resemble the wider community there more and more.

The last deaf person born into the island&#x27;s sign-language tradition, Katie West, died in 1952. A few elderly residents were able to recall MVSL as recently as the 1980s when research into the language began. Indeed, when Oliver Sacks subsequently visited the island after reading a book on the subject, he noted that a group of elderly islanders talking together dropped briefly into sign language then back into speech.

== Life as a deaf person on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard ==

Although the people who were dependent on MVSL were different, they still did the same activities as the typical Martha&#x27;s Vineyard resident would. Deaf people would work both complex and simple jobs, attend island events, and participate within the community. In contrast to some other deaf communities around the world, they were treated as typical people. Deaf people living in rural Mexico have a similar community, but few hearing people live there permanently. Other deaf communities are often isolated from the hearing population; the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard deaf community of that period is exceptional in its integration into the general population.

Deaf MVSL users were not excluded by the rest of society at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, but they certainly faced challenges due to their deafness. Marriage between a deaf person and a hearing person was extremely difficult to maintain, even though both could use MVSL. For this reason, the deaf usually married the deaf, raising the degree of inbreeding even beyond that of the general population of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. This high rate of deaf–deaf marriages increased the deaf population within the community over time, as all offspring of such couples inherited their parents&#x27; shared recessive deafness trait and were also congenitally deaf. The MVSL users often associated closely, helping and working with each other to overcome other issues caused by deafness. They entertained at community events, teaching hearing youngsters more MVSL. The sign language was spoken and taught to hearing children as early as their first years to help them communicate with the many deaf people they would encounter in school. Non-manual markers, such as lip movement and facial expressions as well as hand gestures and mannerisms were all studied. There were even separate schools specifically for learning MVSL. Hearing people sometimes signed even when there were no deaf people present. For example, children signed behind a schoolteacher&#x27;s back, adults signed to one another during church sermons, farmers signed to their children across a wide field, and fishermen signed to each other from their boats across the water where the spoken word would not carry.

== Decline ==
Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language declined after the opening of the American School for the Deaf. Although students from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard influenced the creation of American Sign Language with contributions from MVSL when they returned home, they brought ASL usage back with them, and MVSL faded. Additionally, as transportation became easier in the 19th century, the influx of hearing people meant that more genetic diversity was introduced, and hereditary deafness was no longer commonplace. The last person in the line of hereditary deafness of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard was Katie West, who died in 1952. Following her death, Oliver Sacks noted in the 1980s that some elderly hearing residents of the island could remember a few signs, but the language truly died out after this point.

== Resurgence of Sign Language on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard ==
In recent years there has been a push to reintroduce American sign language into the Island&#x27;s culture. A Martha&#x27;s Vineyard resident, Lynn Thorp, began her mission to revive ASL in the early 2000s with the ultimate goal of reinstating ASL as a second language. After studying the language through references such as &quot;Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language&quot; by Ellen Groce, and a series of 1989 teachings called &quot;Interax&quot;, Thorp began meeting with fellow Vineyard residents every week to practice sign language together. About a decade later, Thorp began teaching classes regularly at local community centers. Recently, the Edgartown Elementary School has adopted ASL into their regular curriculum, and other Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Public Schools are soon to follow.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Show Me a Sign&quot; by Ann Clare LeZotte is a middle grade novel about the thriving deaf community living on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in the early part of the 19th century. In the novel deaf and hearing characters successfully use Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language to communicate with each other.

<text>Said Bahaji (, also transliterated as Saeed Bahaji, also known as Zuhayr al-Maghribi, 15 July 1975 in Haselünne, Lower Saxony – September 2013), was a citizen of Germany, electrical engineer, and an alleged member of the Hamburg cell that provided money and material support to the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks.

==History==

Bahaji was a German citizen, born in 1975 to a Moroccan father and a German mother. Raised in a small town in Lower Saxony, he moved with his family when he was nine years old to Morocco, where he completed his education. He came to Hamburg in 1995. He enrolled in an electrical engineering program at a technical university in 1996. He spent five months in the German army and then received a medical discharge. He lived in a student home during the weekdays and he spent weekends with his aunt, Barbara Arens. Both of them loved computers, and he called her his &quot;high-tech aunt&quot;. She saw that he was secular until other students introduced him to radical Islam. She later put an end to the weekend visits.

On November 1, 1998, he moved into an apartment in Germany with future hijackers Mohamed Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. The Hamburg cell was born at this apartment. They met three or four times a week to discuss their anti-American feelings and plot possible attacks. Many al-Qaeda members lived in this apartment at various times, including hijacker Marwan al-Shehhi, Zakariya Essabar, and others. He served as the group&#x27;s Internet expert.

He had already been under investigation by German intelligence for his connections with Mohammed Haydar Zammar, a radical Islamic cleric. Through this, German intelligence was able to learn some of the activities of Atta and others, but the investigation was eventually dropped for lack of evidence.

In October 1999, he got married at the Al-Quds Mosque in Hamburg. Atta, Jarrah, Shehhi, Zammar, and bin al-Shibh all attended his wedding.

In late 1999, Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and bin al-Shibh decided to travel to Chechnya to fight against the Russians, but were convinced by Khalid al-Masri and Mohamedou Ould Slahi at the last minute to change their plans. They instead traveled to Afghanistan to meet with Osama bin Laden and train for terrorist attacks. There are conflicting reports as to whether he went with them; some news reports say that he went, but the 9/11 Commission Report says he stayed in Germany and helped cover for them in their absence. When the group returned to Germany, he was put on a border patrol watch list.

He told his employer in June 2001 that he was going to an internship for a software company in Pakistan. His aunt, Barbara Arens, says that she was suspicious and that she went to the police and pleaded to them &quot;to do something.&quot; She says that police took no action against him. 
Al-Qaeda leader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told him in August that if he wanted to go to Afghanistan, he should go in the next few weeks, because it would soon become more difficult. He left Germany on September 4, 2001, just a week before the attacks, and flew to Karachi via Istanbul.

==Aftermath of the attacks==
He and Ramzi bin al-Shibh were charged with 5,000 counts of murder by German officials. Bin al-Shibh was arrested on 11 September 2002, but Bahaji was still at large at the time.

During the October 2009, Pakistan military operation against terrorists in South Waziristan, his German passport was found in a captured militant town. This region, part of the tribal areas, had become a sanctuary for al-Qaeda and other jihadist groups following the collapse of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in late 2001.

In mid-2010, Bahaji reunited with Ahmad Wali Sidiqi and Naamen Meziche, longtime acquaintances from Hamburg. According to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, the meeting was described as a joyful gathering of old veterans.

==Death==
In August 2017, the Associated Press reported that al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri announced in an audio message that Bahaji (referring to him by his alias &quot;Zuhayr al-Maghrebi&quot;) had died but did not say when or how he died. In a list published by the United Nations Security Council of people and entities against whom there are sanctions, Bahaji is said to be &quot;reportedly deceased in September 2013 in the Afghanistan/Pakistan border area.&quot;

However, the German BKA still maintains an active wanted notice for Bahaji, which was last updated in June 2024.

<doc id="390852" wikidata="Q31694" url="?curid=390852" title="Edible frog">
<text>The edible frog (Pelophylax&quot; kl. &quot;esculentus) is a hybrid species of common European frog, also known as the common water frog or green frog (however, this latter term is also used for the North American species &quot;Rana clamitans&quot;).

It is used for food, particularly in France as well as Germany and Italy, for the delicacy frog legs. Females are between long, males between .

This widespread and common frog has many common names, including European dark-spotted frog, European black-spotted pond frog, and European black-spotted frog.

==Distribution==
&quot;Pelophylax esculentus&quot; is endemic to Europe. It naturally occurs from the northern half of France to western Russia, and from Estonia and Denmark to Bulgaria and northern Italy. The edible frog is introduced in Spain, Norway and the United Kingdom. The natural range is nearly identical to that of &quot;P. lessonae&quot;.

== Hybridogenesis ==

&quot;Pelophylax&quot; kl. &quot;esculentus&quot; is the fertile hybrid of the pool frog (&quot;Pelophylax lessonae&quot;) and the marsh frog (&quot;Pelophylax ridibundus&quot;). It reproduces by hybridogenesis (hemiclonally).

Hybridogenesis implies that during gametogenesis hybrids (of RL genotype) exclude one parental genome (L or R) and produce gametes with an unrecombined genome of the other parental species (R or L, respectively), instead of containing mixed recombined parental genomes. The hybrid populations are usually propagated by mating (backcrosses) with a sympatric parental species – &quot;P. lessonae&quot; (LL) or &quot;P. ridibundus&quot; (RR) – providing the second, discarded parental genome (L or R respectively). Hybridogenesis is thus a hemiclonal mode of reproduction; half of the genome is transmitted to the next generation clonally, unrecombined (intact); the other half sexually, recombined.

For example, in the most widespread so called L–E system, edible frogs &quot;Pelophylax&quot; kl. &quot;esculentus&quot; (RE) produce gametes of the marsh frog &quot;P. ridibundus&quot; (R) and mate with coexisting pool frogs &quot;Pelophylax lessonae&quot; (L gametes) – see below in the middle.
Because this hybrid requires another taxon as a sexual host to reproduce, usually one of the parental species, it is a klepton, hence the addition of the &quot;kl.&quot; (for &quot;klepton&quot;) in the species name.

There are also known all-hybrid populations, where diploid hybrids (LR) coexist with triploid (LLR or LRR) hybrids, providing L or R genomes respectively. In this situation, diploid hybrids (LR) generate not only haploid R or L gametes, but also the diploid gametes (RL) needed to recreate triploids.

<text>Arenal Volcano () is an active andesitic stratovolcano in north-western Costa Rica around northwest of San José, in the province of Alajuela, canton of San Carlos, and district of La Fortuna. The Arenal volcano measures at least high. It is conically shaped with a crater in diameter. Geologically, Arenal is considered a young volcano and it is estimated to be less than 7,500 years old. It is also known as &quot;Pan de Azúcar&quot;, &quot;Canaste&quot;, &quot;Volcan Costa Rica&quot;, &quot;Volcan Río Frío&quot; or &quot;Guatusos Peak&quot;.

The volcano was dormant for hundreds of years and exhibited 2 craters at its summit, with minor fumaroles activity, covered by dense vegetation. In 1968 it erupted unexpectedly, destroying the small town of Tabacón. Due to the eruption three more craters were created on the western flanks but only one of them exists today. Arenal&#x27;s eruption from 1968 to 2010 is the tenth longest duration volcanic eruption on Earth since 1750. Since 2010, Arenal has been dormant.

==Geographic setting and description==
Arenal is one of seven historically active Costa Rican volcanoes along with Poás, Irazú, Miravalles, Orosí, Rincón de la Vieja complex, and Turrialba. It was Costa Rica&#x27;s most active volcano until 2010, and one of the ten most active volcanoes in the world. It has been studied by seismologists for many years. The volcano is located at the center of Arenal Volcano National Park in the northern zone of the country, southwest of the La Fortuna district in San Carlos (canton), Costa Rica.

Arenal Volcano area is an important watershed for the Arenal Lake Reservoir. The reservoir&#x27;s water is used for hydroelectric power. It is also connected to the national system.

Arenal has several eruptive vents. Chato is a dormant stratovolcanic cone. It is believed that Chato first erupted 38,000 years ago during the Pleistocene period and last erupted about 3,500 years ago. Chatito is a lava dome with an elevation of . Espina is another lava dome.

==Geologic history==
Arenal is the youngest of all the volcanoes in Costa Rica. Scientists have been able to date its activity back more than 7000 years. The area remained largely unexplored until 1937, when a documented expedition took place to reach the summit. It was eruptive from 1968 until 2010.

===July 29, 1968===

On Monday, July 29, 1968, at 7:30 am, the Arenal Volcano suddenly and violently erupted. The eruptions continued unabated for several days, burying over under rocks, lava and ash. When it was finally over, the eruptions had killed 87 people and buried 3 small villages – Tabacón, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luís – and affected more than of land. Crops were spoiled, property was ruined, and large numbers of livestock were killed.

At the height of its ferocious activity, the volcano flung giant rocks – some weighing several tons – more than a kilometer (half a mile) away at a rate of . These explosions would go on to form three new active craters.

As the three towns were destroyed on the western side of the volcano, a town by the name of El Borio on the east side was untouched and unharmed. It is a popular myth that after the volcano ceased to erupt, El Borio was renamed La Fortuna, which means &quot;The Fortune&quot;, referring to its luckiness that the volcano erupted to the west and not the east. However, the town was renamed La Fortuna by its residents before the 1968 eruption. &quot;The Fortune&quot; refers to the flat, fertile lands in the area, which are unlike the rough, mountainous terrain which surrounds most of the Arenal volcano.

===June 1975===
Between the 17th and the 21st of June 1975 several avalanches went down from one of the craters. The vegetation along Tabacon River was destroyed and a great amount of material was deposited on the riverbed. Four strong explosions also blew large amounts of ash into the sky. The ash was spread within a distance of .

===March 1996===
At this time the volcano started to produce regular lava flows, accompanied by intermittent explosions of gases. This was the regular activity of the volcano until May 5, 1998.

===May 5, 1998===
The Arenal Volcano experienced a series of large eruptions on Tuesday afternoon, May 5, 1998. The first ratchet eruption was recorded at 1:05 p.m. when part of the northwest wall of the crater fell apart. Large amounts of lava, rocks, and ash flew out of the volcano during this explosion. Another eruption took place at 2:20 p.m. with material emerging from the same part of the volcano.

A specialist from the Costa Rica Volcanic and Seismic Observatory explained that the eruptions are nothing unusual for the volcano. Nevertheless, during this occasion, the amount of lava within the crater was significantly greater than normal and therefore more material was poured out. This time a landslide took place, too, as a part of the crater wall falling apart on the northwest side. This phenomenon occurs sporadically, although this time the consequences were greater than usual.

As a normal precaution, authorities declared a red alert, closed the road between La Fortuna and Tilarán, which runs around the north side of the volcano, and evacuated approximately 450 people (mostly tourists) from the immediate area, including several hotels and tourism-oriented businesses. There were no reports of injuries caused by the volcanic activity.

At 5:20 p.m. on Tuesday the volcano was still discharging material, but activity had decreased significantly.

===May 7, 1998===
The eruptions of May 7, 1998, damaged and destroyed a area of green forest in the vicinity of Arenal Volcano. A fissure, long and deep, was opened up in the wall of the crater and all the material slid down the side of the volcano.

During this day 23 eruptions were reported, between 1:05 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., and thereafter the volcano returned to its normal state. Authorities reported no unusual behavior and the national park was reopened the same week. Local seismologists investigate the activity of the volcano and park rangers continue to vigorously enforce the safety perimeter.

===October, 2010===
Last eruption reported, presence of fumeroles at the summit, under Green Alert (calm status) by local authorities.

<doc id="390863" wikidata="Q213609" url="?curid=390863" title="Ian Paice">
<text>Ian Anderson Paice (born 29 June 1948) is an English musician who is the drummer and last remaining original member of the rock band Deep Purple. He remains the only member of Deep Purple who has served in every line-up since the band&#x27;s inception in 1968, as well as having played on every album and at every live appearance. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple in 2016.

Aside from Deep Purple, he was also a member of a number of projects that also involved other Deep Purple members, including Whitesnake (also featuring Jon Lord and David Coverdale, both of Deep Purple), and Paice Ashton Lord (also featuring Jon Lord). He also played drums backing other musicians, including Gary Moore, the Velvet Underground, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison.

== Biography ==
===The early years===
Born in Nottingham before moving south in early childhood, Paice got his first drum kit at 15. He began his professional career in the early 1960s playing drums in his father&#x27;s dance band. The first band he was in was called Georgie &amp; the Rave-Ons, which after being renamed the Shindigs released their first single featuring the 17-year-old Paice and George Adams.

In 1966 Paice joined the MI5, which soon changed its name to the Maze. Primarily a club band, the Maze produced a number of singles, recorded mainly in Italy and France.

===Deep Purple===

The Maze featured vocalist Rod Evans, who alongside Paice was to form the original line-up of Deep Purple in March 1968. Evans had responded to an ad for a lead singer published by Deep Purple management, and showed up for his audition with Ian Paice in tow. Given that Deep Purple&#x27;s first choice as drummer, Bobby Woodman, had expressed dislike for the band&#x27;s musical direction, the group hastily arranged an audition for Paice, with guitarist Ritchie Blackmore leading the charge. Blackmore in interviews years later stated: &quot;I had looked for Ian Paice for about a year after seeing him perform in Hamburg. He&#x27;s an incredible drummer. And he was the motor of the band&quot;. Paice is the last remaining original Deep Purple member in the band in the present day.

===Whitesnake===
Deep Purple split up in 1976 and eventually reformed in 1984. During the split, Paice formed a new group, Paice Ashton Lord in 1976. The band, also comprising singer/pianist Tony Ashton, Deep Purple organist Jon Lord, guitarist/vocalist Bernie Marsden and bassist Paul Martinez, recorded one album (&quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot;) and played only five live shows. Paice Ashton Lord were put on hold in 1977, halfway through recording the group&#x27;s second album. They subsequently broke up, allegedly because Tony Ashton only felt at home playing live shows in little clubs.

In August 1979, Paice was asked by David Coverdale to join Whitesnake on the Japanese tour for the &quot;Lovehunter&quot; album. He stayed with the band for almost three years. He appeared on the Whitesnake albums &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot; (1980), &quot;Live...in the Heart of the City&quot; (1980), &quot;Come an&#x27; Get It&quot; (1981) and &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; (1982).

This incarnation of Whitesnake featured David Coverdale and Jon Lord, which meant three members of the Mark III and IV line-ups of Deep Purple were in Whitesnake during this period. Following musical differences with David Coverdale, Paice left Whitesnake in January 1982.

===Gary Moore Band===
In 1982, Paice joined Gary Moore for an album that turned into &quot;Corridors of Power&quot;. Moore&#x27;s manager subsequently came up with the idea of Moore and Paice putting a band together under Moore&#x27;s name, so that his management would take the business side of the project with Paice having a sizeable interest in the band. The collaboration turned out to be a successful one and produced a couple of albums and extensive tours. Paice left Moore&#x27;s band in April 1984 when the reformed Deep Purple reconvened, and he remains in Deep Purple to the present day.

===Notable collaborations===
Paice played drums on the Velvet Underground&#x27;s final album &quot;Squeeze&quot;, which was released in 1973. At that point, the band only consisted of singer and multi-instrumentalist Doug Yule (all of the other members, including Lou Reed, had either left or been fired by their manager), and the album was poorly received and quickly fell into obscurity.

In 1973, Paice was among English rock musicians invited by Eddie Harris, an American jazz player, to take part in the saxophonist&#x27;s London sessions at Morgan Studios. Paice played on two songs: &quot;He&#x27;s Island Man&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Tried Everything&quot; along with Jeff Beck, Steve Winwood and Rick Grech. The album, called &quot;E.H. in the U.K. – The Eddie Harris London Sessions&quot;, produced by Geoffrey Haslam, was released the next year thru Atlantic Records.

In 1983, Paice took part in one of the first tribute recordings by symphonic orchestra paid to a rock band. &quot;Arrested – The Music of Police&quot; was a joint venture by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Don Airey and assembled rock musicians (other artists involved included Neil Murray, Graham Bonnet, Chris Thompson, Gary Moore, Roy Wood, Keth Airey and Raff Ravenscroft). The sessions took place mainly in London, primarily at Abbey Road Studios, but also in Los Angeles.

In July 1989, Paice took part in George Harrison&#x27;s recording session at Friar Park, which resulted in three songs &quot;Cheer Down&quot;, &quot;Cockamamie Business&quot; and &quot;Poor Little Girl&quot;, which also featured Jeff Lynne, Jim Horn and Richard Tandy among others. The songs were recorded for the compilation album &quot;Best of Dark Horse 1976-1989&quot;, released in October the same year. The purpose of this album was to close Harrison&#x27;s contractual obligations to Warner Brothers. &quot;Cheer Down&quot; was also released on the &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; (1989) soundtrack album.

In March 1999, Paice joined Paul McCartney at Abbey Road Studios for the recording of &quot;Run Devil Run&quot;, released in October that year. The line-up also featured Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour and The Pirates&#x27; Mick Green. Paice also joined the album&#x27;s line-up at three one-off performances in September and December 1999, including a show at the famous Cavern Club. Steve Morse said of Paice: &quot;He&#x27;s like a real heavy Ringo. He&#x27;s just so good on the drums, but doesn&#x27;t want to make a big deal about it.&quot;

In 2001, Paice guested on Jim Capaldi&#x27;s album &quot;Living on the Outside&quot;. He played on a 1960s-style rock-and-roll song, &quot;Anna Julia&quot;, and the guitar-driven &quot;We&#x27;re Not Alone&quot;. &quot;Anna Julia&quot;, which was also released as a single and turned out a considerable hit, also features George Harrison and Paul Weller.

Paice has worked on numerous occasions with former Spencer Davis Group drummer, Pete York. In December 2001 the two played a low key club tour of Germany, playing two drums on one stage, supported by Colin Hodgkinson (bass) and Miller Anderson (guitar, vocals). Apart from the regular setlist consisting of songs from York&#x27;s and Paice&#x27;s back catalogue, the shows featured impromptu drumming demonstrations and Q&amp;A sessions.

Paice often joins Italian guitarist Tolo Marton, with whom he has performed on many occasions over the last decade, on stage. Marton&#x27;s live album &quot;Dal Vero&quot; features Paice on the Jimi Hendrix songs &quot;Stone Free&quot; and &quot;Hey Joe&quot;. Since 2005, he has also been involved in Moonstone Project led by Italian guitarist Matteo Filippini. The band performs regularly, mainly in Italy; they have also released two studio albums on which Paice has guested. &quot;Time to Take a Stand&quot;, released in 2006, featured two songs featuring both Paice and Glenn Hughes, performing together for the first time since 1976.

The list of Paice&#x27;s declared admirers includes Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; Chad Smith. On 21 June 2004 Smith and Paice joined forces at the launch of the London Drum Company. The next year they also played together at the Modern Drummer Festival at New Jersey Performing Arts Center. Both performances were released on DVD.

In mid-2011, Paice took part in the all-star recording of William Shatner&#x27;s &quot;Seeking Major Tom&quot;, the actor&#x27;s fourth album, a collection of space-themed cover songs. Paice plays on a rendition of Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot; alongside Johnny Winter. The album also features former Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore.

===Special performances/charity activities===
On 19 June 1992, Paice was among guest musicians performing at the Leukaemia Research charity concert in Oxford. The concert featured members of Bad Company and Procol Harum as well as Gary Moore and Tony Ashton.

On 20 October 1992 in New York, Paice played at the John Bonham Tribute alongside Jason Bonham, Tommy Aldridge, Denny Carmassi, and Frankie Banali among others. Paice performed &quot;The Rover&quot; from the Led Zeppelin album &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;.

Paice joined Tony Ashton at two performances at the Hell Blues Festival on 10 and 11 September 1999 in Norway. The band also featured Paul Martinez on bass, who had played alongside Ashton and Paice in Paice Ashton Lord in 1976/1977. The group was, however, billed as Tony Ashton &amp; Legendary Friends.

Paice entertained more than 1000 people at a special charity concert in Reading on 13 January 2006. This highly successful event, which raised over £7000, was organised by Chris Wright, MD of DrumWright. The show was organised in aid of Tong-Len, which supports primary education for highly deprived children in Northern India.

On 31 March and 1 April 2006, Paice joined Don Airey, Thomas Blug and Thijs van Leer at impromptu performances held during the ProLight+Sound fair in Frankfurt, Germany. The show included songs from the highly acclaimed Billy Cobham album &quot;Spectrum&quot; as well as songs by Deep Purple and Focus.

Since 2006, Paice has also been involved in The Sunflower Jam, a London-based charity founded by his wife Jacky Paice and also involving actor Jeremy Irons. Paice is usually featured as a member of the SunflowerJam house band. He has performed there with likes of Robert Plant, Brian May, John Paul Jones, Gary Moore and Bruce Dickinson.

On 2 March 2007, Paice held a drum clinic organised by the University of Glamorgan. The show was organised in partnership with ATRiuM the University&#x27;s Cardiff School of Creative &amp; Cultural Industries. Commenting after the show Paice said: &quot;ATRiuM will be a great place for young musicians to learn their craft, not to mention all the other things they’ve got going on there. This drum clinic of mine will hopefully demonstrate that drummers are also musicians, despite the jokes!&quot;.

On 13 January 2008, Paice took part in the ChildLine Rocks charity concert in London, where he played live with former Deep Purple bassist Glenn Hughes for the first time since 1976.

On 24 May 2008, Paice participated in &quot;Rock Legends Adventure&quot; concert in Cologne, Germany. He joined an all-stars line-up featuring Pete York, Leland Sklar, Steve Lukather, Bobby Kimball and John Miles among others. Paice played on 10 of 32 songs performed that night, including The Kinks&#x27; &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;Come Together&quot;, Allman Brothers Band&#x27;s &quot;One Way Out&quot;, Steve Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Superstition&quot; and Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;.

Paice appeared at the Pearl Day (Pearl drums event) which was held on 1 June 2008 at the East Midlands Conference Centre in Nottingham, UK. Apart from Paice, guests included Jerry Brown, Mark Brzezecki, Jimmy Degrasso, Darrin Mooney, and Dan Foord.

On 6 September 2009, Paice joined Neil Murray, Doogie White, Jonathan Noyce, Clive Bunker and Phil Hilborne at a &quot;Night with Jethro Tull and Deep Purple&quot; concert in Turin, Italy.

On 18 April 2010, Paice, Jon Lord and Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson joined leading actors (Gillian Anderson, Julie Christie, Sinéad Cusack, Emilia Fox, Derek Jacobi, Zoe Wanamaker, James Wilby, among others) to support Survival International at the Apollo Theatre in London for fundraising event &quot;We are One – a celebration of tribal peoples&quot;, created by actor Mark Rylance.

On 2 April 2012, Paice performed at the Buddy Rich 25th Anniversary Memorial Concert at the London Palladium. He was joined on stage by the Buddy Rich Orchestra and Bruce Dickinson.

On 16 September 2012, Paice appeared at the Sunflower Jam charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall, performing alongside guitarist 
Brian May of Queen, bassist John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, and vocalists Bruce Dickinson and Alice Cooper.

==Personal life==
Paice is married and has three children: James, Emmy and Calli. His wife, Jacky, is the twin sister of the late Jon Lord&#x27;s wife, Vicky.

It had been rumored (and even mentioned by former Gillan guitarist Bernie Torme in an interview) that Paice has only one lung: in reality, he is only missing a portion of the lower lobe in his left lung, due to contracting a case of pneumonia when he was six years old that turned into tuberculosis.

He is almost always seen wearing glasses with blue (or occasionally green or purple)-tinted spectacle lenses.

Paice is a supporter of England rugby and has a good knowledge of the game. His son James played for a long time. He talked about it in &quot;Oval Bin&quot; Show with Luca Tramontin.

===Health===
On 14 June 2016, he suffered a transient ischaemic attack, or mini stroke. This led to Deep Purple cancelling two concerts planned in Sweden that week. He said after the incident that there was &quot;no serious or permanent damage&quot; and expected to return to performing in July. He added that the cancelled concerts were the first Deep Purple performances of which he had forced the cancellation since his co-founding of the band in 1968. He returned to stage with Deep Purple in Gothenburg on 1 July, playing a full setlist with the band, but without performing his drum solo.

==Equipment==

Today Paice uses Pearl drumkits as his main performing drums, incorporating Paiste cymbals, Remo drumheads and Pro-Mark drumsticks. He used Ludwig kits during the seventies and early eighties in remarkable large sizes: 26&quot; Bass drum, 16&quot; Tom, an 18 &amp; 20&quot; floor tom and 14 x 6.5&quot; Supraphonic snare which was a blueprint for his signature snare from Pearl. In 1982 he switched companies, because Ludwig&#x27;s development stalled and he got a better deal from Pearl. He also prefers a single bass drum set-up, both live and in the studio. Pearl Drums produce his signature snare drum.

He has also released a solo DVD which is aimed at both drummers and music fans in general.

==Influences and style==
Paice&#x27;s early influences include jazz and rock drummers such as Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, Bobby Elliott, Ringo Starr and Charles Connor, and later he was inspired by Carmine Appice, Ginger Baker and Mitch Mitchell.

He is primarily left-handed with a left-handed drum-kit set-up and uses the matched-grip approach. He is well known for his extremely fast and smooth single and double-stroke rolls as well as single bass pedal speed. He did however perform once with a double-bass setup on the title track of the &quot;Fireball&quot; album and was performed live occasionally. He is also known for perfecting the one-handed roll as demonstrated on a Drummerworld video.

Paice has been cited as an influence on many notable rock drummers, including Clive Burr, Mikkey Dee, Virgil Donati, Dave Grohl, Gary James, Simon Phillips and Matt Starr.

==Recognition==
On 5 November 2007 at the Classic Rock Awards, Jacky and Ian Paice received the ChildLine award in recognition of their philanthropic work with the SunflowerJam raising money for children with cancer. Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden presented them with the award. It was the first time the award has been given.

On 2 April 2012, Paice was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Buddy Rich 25th Anniversary Memorial Concert at the London Palladium.

He was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2016, Paice was ranked 21st in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot;.

As a member of Deep Purple, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 8 April 2016.

<text>Rhinogradentia is a fictitious order of extinct shrew-like mammals invented by German zoologist Gerolf Steiner. Members of the order, known as rhinogrades or snouters, are characterized by a nose-like feature called a &quot;nasorium&quot;, which evolved to fulfill a wide variety of functions in different species. Steiner also created a fictional persona, naturalist Harald Stümpke, who is credited as author of the 1961 book &quot;Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia&quot; (translated into English in 1967 as &quot;The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades&quot;). According to Steiner, it is the only remaining record of the animals, which were wiped out, along with all the world&#x27;s Rhinogradentia researchers, when the small Pacific archipelago they inhabited sank into the ocean due to nearby atomic bomb testing.

Successfully mimicking a genuine scientific work, Rhinogradentia has appeared in several publications without any note of its fictitious nature, sometimes in connection with April Fools&#x27; Day.

==Background==
Rhinogradentia, their island home of Hy-yi-yi, zoologist Harald Stümpke, and a host of other people, places, and documents are fictional creations of Gerolf Steiner (1908–2009), a German zoologist. Steiner is best known for his fictional work as Stümpke, but he was an accomplished zoologist in his own right. He held a professorship at the University of Heidelberg and later the Technical University of Karlsruhe, where he occupied the department chair from 1962 to 1973.

Steiner was also interested in illustration, and in 1945 drew a picture for one of his students as thanks for some food. He took inspiration from a short nonsense poem by Christian Morgenstern, &quot;The Nasobame&quot; (&quot;Das Nasobēm&quot;) about an animal that walked using its nose. He took to the drawing, made a copy for himself, and later incorporated the creatures into his teaching. According to Bud Webster, Steiner&#x27;s motivation for writing a book about them was instructional, to illustrate &quot;how animals evolve in isolation&quot;, but Joe Cain speculates that the success of the joke may have led to a teaching and writing career based on that rather than the other way around.

==Harald Stümpke&#x27;s account==
Steiner&#x27;s fictional author, credited as &quot;quondam curator of the Museum of the Darwin Institute of Hy-yi-yi, Mairuwili&quot;, provides a very detailed account of the order and individual species, written in a dry, scholarly tone. Michael Ohl wrote that the book is written &quot;in truly amusing attention to detail and using what is immediately recognizable as a practiced scientific patois&quot;. The evidently expert voice of the author, his competent writing, and apparent familiarity with conventions of academic literature set the work apart as a rare example at the intersection of fiction and scholarship. Steiner credits himself by name as illustrator of the book, and explains how that role led him to possess the only remaining record of Rhinogradentia.

===Discovery and study at Hy-yi-yi===
According to Stümpke, Rhinogradentia were native to Hy-yi-yi, a small Pacific archipelago comprising eighteen islands: Annoorussawubbissy, Awkoavussa, Hiddudify, Koavussa, Lowlukha, Lownunnoia, Mara, Miroovilly, Mittuddinna, Naty, Nawissy, Noorubbissy, Osovitissy, Ownavussa, Owsuddowsa, Shanelukha, Towteng-Awko, and Vinsy. The islands occupied and the archipelago&#x27;s highest peak, , was on its main island, Hiddudify (Hy-dud-dye-fee).

The first description of Hy-yi-yi published in Europe was that of Einar Pettersson-Skämtkvist, a Swedish explorer who arrived in Hiddudify by chance in 1941, after escaping from a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. Each of the islands was home to distinctive fauna, dominated by Rhinogradentia, the only mammals other than humans and one species of shrew. In the time after the war, a number of scientists took interest in the rhinogrades and began formal research into their physiology, morphology, behaviors, and evolution.

In the late 1950s, nearby nuclear weapons testing by the United States military accidentally caused all of the islands of Hy-yi-yi to sink into the ocean, destroying all traces of the rhinogrades and their unique ecosystem. Also killed were all the world&#x27;s Rhinogradentia researchers, who were attending a conference on Hy-yi-yi at the time. The book&#x27;s epilogue, credited to Steiner in his capacity as the book&#x27;s illustrator, explains that Stümpke had sent the book&#x27;s materials to Steiner to serve as the basis for illustrations in preparation for publication. Following the disaster, it is the only remaining record of the subjects it describes.

===Biological characteristics and behavior===

Rhinogrades are mammals characterized by a nose-like feature called a &quot;nasorium&quot;, the form and function of which vary significantly between species. According to Stümpke, the order&#x27;s remarkable variety was the natural outcome of evolution acting over millions of years in the remote Hy-yi-yi islands. All the 14 families and 189 known snouter species descended from a small shrew-like animal, which gradually evolved and diversified to fill most of the ecological niches in the archipelago — from tiny worm-like beings to large herbivores and predators.

Many rhinogrades used their nose for locomotion, for example the &quot;snout leapers&quot; like &quot;Hopsorrhinus aureus&quot;, whose nasorium was used for jumping, or the &quot;earwings&quot; like &quot;Otopteryx&quot;, which flew backwards by flapping its ears and used its nose as a rudder. Some species used their nasorium for catching food, for example by using it to fish or to attract and trap insects. Other species included the fierce &quot;Tyrannonasus imperator&quot; and the shaggy &quot;Mammontops&quot;.

Pettersson-Skämtkvist&#x27;s early descriptions of the animals he encountered on Hy-yi-yi led zoologists to name them after the title creature in Christian Morgenstern&#x27;s &quot;The Nasobame&quot;. In the poem, which exists outside of this fictional universe and also served as an inspiration for Steiner, the Nasobame is seen &quot;striding on its noses&quot; (&quot;auf seinen Nasen schreitet&quot;).

===Genera===
Stümpke&#x27;s book classifies 138 species of rhinograde in the following fictitious genera:
The names generally refer to particular forms or functions of the nasorium of animals in that genus, typically providing vernacular names for clarity.

==Legacy==

Rhinogradentia is considered one of the best known biological hoaxes and scientific jokes and Steiner&#x27;s pseudonymous works on the subject continue to be reprinted and translated. The first edition did not explicitly state that it was a hoax.

Following the publication of the French translation, George Gaylord Simpson wrote a seemingly serious review which extended the hoax in a 1963 issue of the journal &quot;Science&quot;, taking issue with the way Stümpke named the animals as &quot;criminal violations of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature&quot;. Simpson also noted that Stümpke neglected to include an unrelated mathematical concept, a &quot;rotated matrix&quot;.

Since the book&#x27;s original publication several scientists and publishers have written about Rhinogradentia as though Steiner&#x27;s account were true, though it is unclear how many of those who continued and popularized the joke did so intentionally. Wulf Ankle wrote that the order &quot;is not a poetic invention, but has really lived&quot;. Rolf Siewing&#x27;s &quot;Zoology Primer&quot; lists them as an order of mammal, noting that their existence is doubted. Erich von Holst celebrated the discovery of &quot;a completely new animal world&quot;. Timothy E. Lawlor&#x27;s widely read textbook &quot;Handbook to the Orders and Families of Living Mammals&quot; includes an entry for Rhinogradentia that does not acknowledge its fictional nature. The East German &quot;Liberal Democratic Newspaper&quot; took note of the nuclear demise of the rhinogrades, writing that they would still be alive &quot;had we, the peaceable powers, managed in time to implement widespread disarmament and prohibit the production and testing of nuclear weapons.&quot;
Prior to the publication of Leigh Chadwick&#x27;s English translation, an abbreviated version ran in the April 1967 edition of &quot;Natural History&quot;, a magazine published by the American Museum of Natural History. It comprised material from the book&#x27;s introduction, first chapter, selected descriptions of genera, and the epilogue, and was presented as the lead story, without qualification, by the normally serious publication. The following month, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a story about the snouters on the front page, based on the &quot;Natural History&quot; article. According to the magazine&#x27;s editorial director, they had &quot;received more than 100 letters and telegraphs about the snouters, most of them from people who forgot that the article was published on April Fool&#x27;s Day.&quot; &quot;Natural History&quot; printed several letters to the editor in its June–July issue, and conveyed to the &quot;Times&quot; the content of several more, ranging from skeptical to fascinated and continuations of the joke. One reader, entomologist Alice Gray, expressed thanks for the article, which enabled her family to identify an animal-shaped metal bracelet from the South Pacific as having been modeled after a &quot;Hoop Snouter&quot;, and included a drawing to preserve the record because, she said, it had been melted down with some toy soldiers and a spoon by a young cousin with a new casting set.

Decades later, papers are still published purporting to continue Stümpke&#x27;s research or otherwise paying homage to Steiner&#x27;s hoax. In a 2004 paper in the &quot;Russian Journal of Marine Biology&quot;, authors Kashkina &amp; Bukashkina claim to have discovered two new marine genera: &quot;Dendronasus&quot; and an as yet unnamed parasitic taxon. The Max Planck Institute for Limnology announced a new species discovered in Großer Plöner See. On April Fools&#x27; Day in 2012, the National Museum of Natural History in France announced the discovery of a wood-eating termite-like genus, &quot;Nasoperferator&quot;, with a rotating nose resembling a drill.

Rhinogradentia has been included in a number of museum exhibitions and collections. The National Museum of Natural History&#x27;s &quot;Nasoperferator&quot; announcement was accompanied by a two-month exhibit honoring the animals, featuring purported stuffed specimens in its gallery of extinct species. Mock taxidermies of rhinogrades have also been included in an exhibit at the Musée d&#x27;ethnographie de Neuchâtel, and in the permanent collections of the Musée zoologique de la ville de Strasbourg and the Salzburg Haus der Natur.

Three real species have been named after Steiner and Stümpke: &quot;Rhinogradentia steineri&quot;, a snout moth, &quot;Hyorhinomys stuempkei&quot;, a shrew rat also known as the Sulawesi snouter, and &quot;Tateomys rhinogradoides&quot;, the Tate&#x27;s shrew rat.

<doc id="390867" wikidata="Q2093100" url="?curid=390867" title="UHF (film)">
<text>UHF (released internationally as The Vidiot from UHF) is a 1989 American comedy film starring &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, David Bowe, Fran Drescher, Victoria Jackson, Kevin McCarthy, Michael Richards, Stanley Brock, Gedde Watanabe, Billy Barty, Anthony Geary, Emo Philips and Trinidad Silva in his final film role; as Silva died before filming wrapped, the film is dedicated to his memory. Directed by Jay Levey, Yankovic&#x27;s manager, who also co-wrote the screenplay with him, the film was originally released by Orion Pictures and became owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after their takeover in 1997. Yankovic and Levey struggled to find a production company to finance the film, but eventually secured Orion&#x27;s support after agreeing to a budget. Principal photography took place around Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Yankovic stars as shiftless dreamer George Newman, who stumbles into managing a low-budget television station and surprisingly succeeds with his eclectic programming choices, spearheaded by the antics of a janitor turned children&#x27;s television host, Stanley Spadowski (Richards). The competitive upstart provokes a major network station. The title refers to the ultra high frequency (UHF) analog television broadcasting band on which such low-budget television stations were often placed in the United States. Yankovic and Levey wrote the film following Yankovic&#x27;s second album, &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic in 3-D&quot;, and set parodies within George&#x27;s vivid imagination.

Overshadowed by several concurrent major Hollywood blockbusters, &quot;UHF&quot; underperformed commercially and also received mixed critical reviews, which left Yankovic in a slump until the surprise success of his next album &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; in 1992. However, &quot;UHF&quot; soon became a cult film on home video and cable TV. The VHS version was rare and out of print for many years, with high prices online. In 2002, the DVD was released, and Shout! Factory released a special 25th-anniversary edition on November 11, 2014, on DVD and Blu-ray. On July 2, 2024, Shout! Factory released a 35th Anniversary Edition on 4K UHD, with a new 4K scan of the original 35mm camera negative and audio commentary with Weird Al and director Jay Levey.

==Plot==

George Newman, a daydreaming slacker who bounces between jobs, is put in charge of Channel 62, a UHF television station, after his uncle Harvey Bilchik wins ownership of it in a poker game. George and his friend Bob Steckler realize the station is nearly bankrupt, subsisting on reruns of old shows like &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;Mister Ed&quot;. When a package meant for its competitor, VHF station Channel 8, is misdelivered to Channel 62, George decides to deliver it himself, only to be rudely dismissed by RJ Fletcher, owner and CEO of Channel 8. Outside, George meets Stanley Spadowski, a janitor whom RJ had recently fired unfairly for falsely discarding a missing report, and hires him at Channel 62.

The new programs created by George and Bob, including the live children&#x27;s show &quot;Uncle Nutzy&#x27;s Clubhouse&quot;, hosted by George, fail to increase viewership. While fretting over their finances, George forgets his girlfriend Teri&#x27;s birthday dinner and she breaks up with him. The next day, during the &quot;Uncle Nutzy&quot; broadcast, a depressed George abandons the set, hands over hosting responsibilities to Stanley, and goes to a bar with Bob to drown their sorrows, but discovers the patrons enjoying Stanley&#x27;s slapstick antics on Channel 62. Inspired, the pair create various bizarre shows to fill the schedule, headlined by the re-titled &quot;Stanley Spadowski&#x27;s Clubhouse&quot;.

Infuriated that Channel 62&#x27;s ratings now rival those of Channel 8, including a majority of Top Five shows, RJ discovers Harvey owes his bookie Big Louie $75,000 by the end of the week, and offers to pay the debt in exchange for the deed to Channel 62. George launches a telethon to sell stock in the station, which would not only save it from RJ but also make it publicly owned. RJ&#x27;s henchmen stall the telethon by kidnapping Stanley, whom George and several staff-members eventually rescue. RJ again attempts to stall the telethon with a televised public statement, but Channel 62 engineer Philo hijacks it with secretly recorded footage of RJ insulting the town&#x27;s population to Teri&#x27;s face during her visit to his Channel 8 headquarters.

The telethon ends about $2,000 short of its goal. Harvey concedes victory to RJ who, instead of immediately taking ownership, gloats to the crowd. Meanwhile, a homeless man approaches George, asking to buy the remaining stock with money obtained by selling a rare 1955 doubled die cent that RJ, unaware of its true value, gave him when he was begging for change. George pays off Big Louie, Harvey signs the ownership transfer, and the station officially becomes publicly owned. Due to both its tardiness in filing its broadcast license renewal and the tirade that Philo broadcast, the FCC revokes Channel 8&#x27;s license and shuts it down. After the Channel 62 staff and audience celebrate, George and Teri reconcile.

==Production==
Yankovic and his manager Jay Levey had discussed the idea of a movie for Yankovic around 1985, after the success of his third album, &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;; his popularity at that time led the two to thinking what other venues would work for the musician. The story concept they created was based on Yankovic&#x27;s approach to his music video parodies. After sketching several such parodies for a film, they conceived Yankovic&#x27;s character owning a small-time UHF station broadcasting these parodies as shows, as this would not require having any significant plot to string the parodies together, in a manner similar to &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980).

The two shopped the script around Hollywood film agencies for about three years. They were surprised to learn one of their agents had shown the script to the founders of a new production company, Cinecorp, which was interested and had given it to producers Gene Kirkwood and John W. Hyde; Kirkwood stated he had previously seen Yankovic&#x27;s videos and wanted to make a movie with him. Kirkwood and Hyde had connections with Orion Pictures, which offered up to (equivalent to $ in ).

The title refers to the ultra-high-frequency broadcast band, which in the United States was typically known for low-budget television stations with no network affiliation. Yankovic suggested the title &quot;The Vidiot&quot; for the international release, but the studio chose &quot;The Vidiot from UHF&quot; to connect the international and American versions, with which Yankovic has expressed dissatisfaction.

===Locations===
Primary filming occurred in Tulsa between July 18 and September 21, 1988. Executive producer Gray Frederickson had earlier finished shooting of &quot;The Outsiders&quot; in Oklahoma, and found the ease and cost of filming in the state appealing. They found several favorable factors that made the city suitable for filming. The Kensington Galleria (71st and Lewis) was being closed down to convert the mall into office space, allowing the production team to use it for both sound stage and interior scenes including those for Channels 8 and 62. The mall was situated near a hotel, for housing the cast and crew. The area and close proximity to Dallas allowed them to recruit additional local talent for some of the acts during the telethon scenes.

The Burger World location was Harden&#x27;s Hamburgers at 6835 East 15th Street, and &quot;Bowling for Burgers&quot; was filmed at Rose Bowl Lanes on East 11th Street. The bar location was Joey&#x27;s House of the Blues at 2222 East 61st Street. The building used for Kuni&#x27;s Karate School belongs to Welltown Brewery and is located at 114 West Archer in Tulsa, and &quot;Crazy Ernie&#x27;s Used Car Emporium&quot; was filmed on the lot of Ernie Miller Pontiac at 4700 South Memorial. The dead fish in &quot;Wheel of Fish&quot; were obtained from the White River Fish Market. The news desk was located at OETA, a local PBS member station. The steps of City Hall are actually First Christian Church at 913 S. Boulder, built in 1920. Channel 8&#x27;s exterior is an office block (6655 South Lewis Building) occupied by Hewlett-Packard. The U-62 building was constructed around KGTO 1050&#x27;s AM radio transmitter site (5400 West Edison Street); the real KGTO studios had been moved elsewhere in 1975.

Yankovic was always envisioned to be the central character of the film George Newman, written as a straight man with a vivid imagination as to allow the insertion of the parodies into the film&#x27;s script in a manner similar to the film &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (1947). To focus on the parodies, George was not developed beyond driving the principal storyline. The name &quot;Newman&quot; was selected as homage to &quot;Mad&quot; magazine&#x27;s mascot, Alfred E. Neuman (the title of George&#x27;s children&#x27;s show &quot;Uncle Nutsy&#x27;s Clubhouse&quot; also came from &quot;Mad&quot;).

Yankovic wrote the role of Stanley Spadowski with Michael Richards in mind, having been impressed with his stand-up comedy and performance on the show &quot;Fridays&quot;. Stanley&#x27;s role was influenced by Christopher Lloyd&#x27;s performance on &quot;Taxi&quot;, so Yankovic had considered offering it to him, but kept Richards due to their original premise. Richards&#x27;s agents had told Yankovic that he was not interested in the role due to a bout of Bell&#x27;s palsy, but on second contact, Richards arrived on set and dropped right into the character for the test read.

Other principal roles were cast through normal auditions, with most of the choices based on how well the actor fit the role. For George&#x27;s girlfriend Teri Campbell, they did not significantly develop the relationship because they did not consider Yankovic a romantic lead. Jennifer Tilly and Ellen DeGeneres auditioned, and Victoria Jackson&#x27;s soft demeanor was preferred.

For R.J. Fletcher, they found that Kevin McCarthy was in a similar stage of his career as Leslie Nielsen, one of many &quot;serious vintage actors who had crossed over into satire&quot;, according to Levey, and McCarthy relished the role. Yankovic noted that McCarthy struggled not to laugh during takes. McCarthy later described his character as a fellow who &quot;makes Ebenezer Scrooge look like Sally Struthers&quot;. Yankovic cited one of McCarthy&#x27;s best-known roles as the ageless history teacher in the classic &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Long Live Walter Jameson&quot;. Noting McCarthy&#x27;s gray hair, Yankovic recalled a scene at the end, when Jameson aged rapidly, saying, &quot;For just a split second, he looked just like [in &quot;UHF&quot;].&quot;

Fran Drescher was cast as Pamela Finklestein, for her established comedy and for her nasally voice that made a humorous contrast for a news anchor. The producers considered Jerry Seinfeld for the role of George&#x27;s friend Bob Speck, but he turned it down. David Bowe, a long-time Yankovic fan, easily fit the role during auditions. Philo&#x27;s role was inspired by Joel Hodgson&#x27;s stand-up routines with homemade inventions and deadpan comedy. Hodgson declined the role because he felt he was not a good actor and he was also working on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. Crispin Glover was approached for the role, but only wanted to play a used car salesman. As the producers sought other actors, their casting agent Cathy Henderson suggested Anthony Geary, who had gained popularity on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Geary wanted the role as a fan of Yankovic, and as completely opposite from his normal acting.

Kuni was conceived for Gedde Watanabe, while Yankovic created the role of the clumsy shop teacher for Emo Philips, a close friend of his. Ginger Baker of the rock band Cream volunteered to audition for the role of the hobo, but Yankovic and the production team found Vance Colvig Jr. as a better fit. Levey appears as Mahatma Gandhi in the spoof segment &quot;Gandhi II&quot;.

After Trinidad Silva performed his primary scenes, he was to return for the yet-unfilmed telethon scenes; however, he was killed by a drunken driver on July 31, 1988. The filmmakers were too grief-stricken to use body doubles and changed the telethon.

Sylvester Stallone had initially agreed to a cameo appearance in the final act, where Newman imagines himself as a John Rambo-type soldier on a mission to rescue Stanley Spadowski, but Stallone ultimately declined.

==Reception==
&quot;UHF&quot; received mixed reviews. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 63% rating based on 24 reviews, with an average score of 5.6/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;UHF&quot; is bizarre, freewheeling, and spotty, though its anarchic spirit cannot be denied.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average based on selected critic reviews, the film has a score of 32 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable&quot; reviews. Critic Roger Ebert wrote in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; that Yankovic&#x27;s approach to satire and parody works for the short-form music video, but does not work to fill out a full-length movie. Ebert also called to Yankovic&#x27;s lack of screen presence, creating a &quot;dispirited vacuum at the center of many scenes&quot;; he gave &quot;UHF&quot; one star out of four. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Gene Siskel wrote of the film, &quot;Never has a comedy tried so hard and failed so often to be funny&quot;; he gave it a zero star rating. Fellow &quot;Tribune&quot; critic Dave Kehr said of it &quot;It&#x27;s not surprising to find that &quot;UHF&quot; ultimately resolves itself into a series of four-minute, video-style sketches laid pretty much end-to-end, but at least Weird Al has given feature-length fiction the old college try, introducing rudimentary plot and number of semi-functional characters.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; believed that, as the entire film comprised parodies, it gave no structure for the larger plot to work, thus resulting in &quot;not much of a movie&quot;.

According to Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episode, &quot;UHF&quot; has one of the most successful test screenings in Orion&#x27;s history. Orion Pictures released &quot;UHF&quot; on July 21, 1989, hoping for a blockbuster that would revive their commercial fortunes. However, critical response was negative, and it was out of the theaters by the end of the month. The film has been compared to &quot;Young Einstein&quot;, which similarly scored well with test audiences but failed to make a critical impression. Yankovic has stated that it was not a &quot;critic movie&quot; but was expected to &quot;save the studio&quot; for Orion. He was treated very well because of this, saying: &quot;Every morning I would wake up to fresh strawberries next to my bed. Then, when the movie bombed, I woke up and...no more strawberries!&quot;

Since the month prior to the release of &quot;UHF&quot;, studios released bigger movies like &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;, &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, and &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot;. Yankovic has argued that the draw of these blockbusters depleted the attendance at &quot;UHF&quot;″s premiere. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, in a retrospective, called &quot;UHF&quot; &quot;a sapling among the redwoods&quot; and the type of film that Hollywood has since abandoned. Yankovic and the film&#x27;s other creators considered that the film had a strong audience with younger viewers, which did well to fill midday matinees but did not succeed in helping to sell tickets for more lucrative evening and nighttime showings.

The poor critical response of &quot;UHF&quot; left Yankovic in a slump for three years, impacting the finalization of his next studio album. The slump was broken when the band Nirvana rose to wide popularity, inspiring him to write &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; and complete the album &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;UHF&quot; has since become a cult classic, becoming popular on cable and home video. The movie was released on VHS in Europe, the United States and Canada but, because of the little money earned at the box office, it soon fell out of print. In the several years &quot;UHF&quot; was out of print, it developed a cult following. It was released on DVD in 2002 by MGM and, in its debut week, it became a top ten bestseller in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine. The US and Canadian DVD contains numerous extras including a music video of the theme song, a commentary track featuring director Jay Levey and Yankovic (with surprise guest appearances by costars Michael Richards and Emo Philips and a phoned-in appearance by Victoria Jackson), and a deleted-scenes reel with Yankovic&#x27;s commentary. Shout! Factory released a special 25th Anniversary Edition of &quot;UHF&quot; on November 11, 2014, on DVD and Blu-ray, and Fabulous Films released the movie on Blu-Ray in the United Kingdom on July 27, 2015.

Though Yankovic has considered the possibility of a sequel, he has not actively pursued this. He noted that &quot;UHF&quot; is &quot;a product of its era, and comedy has changed so much over the decades&quot;, but also considered that the type of comedy predated the nature of Internet phenomena and viral videos. Yankovic further maintained the unlikelihood of a sequel to &quot;UHF&quot; in an interview, citing the underwhelming box office returns of the original, and lack of industry interest in financing another &quot;UHF&quot; project.

Gedde Watanabe later reprised his role as Kuni for a guest appearance on &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot; in 1997.

The music video for Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;Word Crimes&quot; has the name George Newman on a test paper, and a Reddit account called u/George-Newman.

A webseries called &quot;The Real UHF&quot; which was heavily inspired by &quot;UHF&quot; started in 2009. It stars Dr. Demento, Neil Hamburger, and Count Smokula, and guest appearances including Devo and George Clinton.

==Soundtrack==
Yankovic released the soundtrack in late 1989, titled &quot;UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff&quot;, with songs and advertisements from the movie and new studio material.

<text>São Paulo (, ; Portuguese for &#x27;Saint Paul&#x27;) is the capital of the state of São Paulo, as well as the most populous city in Brazil, the Americas, and both the Western and Southern Hemisphere. Listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) as an alpha global city, it exerts substantial international influence in commerce, finance, arts, and entertainment. It is the largest urban area by population outside Asia and the most populous Portuguese-speaking city in the world. The city&#x27;s name honors Paul the Apostle and people from the city are known as &quot;paulistanos&quot;. The city&#x27;s Latin motto is &quot;Non ducor, duco&quot;, which translates as &quot;I am not led, I lead.&quot; 

Founded in 1554 by Jesuit priests, the city was the center of the &quot;bandeirantes&quot; settlers during Colonial Brazil, but it became a relevant economic force only during the Brazilian coffee cycle in the mid-19th century and later consolidated its role as the main national economic hub with industrialization in Brazil in the 20th century, which made the city a cosmopolitan melting pot, home to the largest Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas in the world, with ethnic neighborhoods like Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade, and people from more than 200 other countries. The city&#x27;s metropolitan area, Greater São Paulo, is home to more than 20 million inhabitants and ranks as the most populous in Brazil and one of the most populous in the world. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around Greater São Paulo also created the São Paulo Macrometropolis, the first megalopolis in the Southern Hemisphere, with more than 30 million inhabitants.

São Paulo is the largest urban economy in Latin America, representing around 10% of the Brazilian GDP and just over a third of São Paulo state&#x27;s GDP. The city is the headquarters of B3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization, and has several financial districts, mainly in the areas around Paulista, Faria Lima and Berrini avenues. São Paulo is home to 63% of established multinationals in Brazil, and is the source of around one third of the Brazilian scientific production. Its main university, the University of São Paulo, is often considered the best in Brazil and Latin America. The metropolis is also home to several of the tallest skyscrapers in Brazil, including the Platina 220, Figueira Altos do Tatuapé, Mirante do Vale, Edifício Itália, Altino Arantes Building, North Tower and many others. 

The city is one of the main cultural hubs in Latin America and it is home to monuments, parks and museums such as the Latin American Memorial, Ibirapuera Park, São Paulo Museum of Art, Pinacoteca, Cinemateca, Itaú Cultural, Museum of Ipiranga, Catavento Museum, Football Museum, Museum of the Portuguese Language, and the Museum of Image and Sound. São Paulo also holds relevant cultural events like the São Paulo Jazz Festival, São Paulo Art Biennial, São Paulo Fashion Week, Lollapalooza, Primavera Sound, Comic Con Experience and the São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, the second-largest LGBT event in the world. São Paulo was also host of many sporting events such as the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 1963 Pan American Games and the São Paulo Indy 300 in addition to hosting the annual Brazilian Grand Prix of Formula One and the Saint Silvester Road Race.

==History==

===Pre-colonial period===

The region of modern-day São Paulo, then known as Piratininga plains around the Tietê River, was inhabited by the Tupi people, such as the Tupiniquim, Guaianás, and Guarani. Other tribes also lived in areas that today form the metropolitan region.

The region was divided in Caciquedoms (chiefdoms) at the time of encounter with the Europeans. The most notable cacique was Tibiriçá, known for his support for the Portuguese and other European colonists. Among the many indigenous names of places, rivers, neighborhoods, etc., that survive today are Tietê, Ipiranga, Tamanduateí, Anhangabaú, Piratininga, Itaquaquecetuba, Cotia, Itapevi, Barueri, Embu-Guaçu, etc.

===Colonial period===

The Portuguese village of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga was marked by the founding of the Colégio de São Paulo de Piratininga on 25 January 1554. The Jesuit college of twelve priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and Spanish priest José de Anchieta. They built a mission on top of a steep hill between the Anhangabaú and Tamanduateí rivers.

They first had a small structure built of rammed earth, made by Native Indian workers in their traditional style. The priests wanted to evangelize these Indians who lived in the Plateau region of Piratininga and convert them to Christianity. The site was separated from the coast by the Serra do Mar mountain range, called &quot;Serra Paranapiacaba&quot; by the Indians.

The college was named for a Christian saint and its founding on the feast day of the celebration of the conversion of the Apostle Paul of Tarsus. Father José de Anchieta wrote this account in a letter to the Society of Jesus:

For the next two centuries, São Paulo developed as a poor and isolated village that survived largely through the cultivation of subsistence crops by the labor of natives. For a long time, São Paulo was the only village in Brazil&#x27;s interior, as travel was too difficult for many to reach the area. Mem de Sá forbade colonists to use the Caminho do Piraquê &quot;(Piraquê Path)&quot; and today known as Piaçaguera, because of frequent Indian raids along it.

On 22 March 1681, Luís Álvares de Castro, the Second Marquis de Cascais and donee of the Captaincy of São Vicente, moved the capital to the village of São Paulo &quot;(see Timeline of São Paulo)&quot;, designating it the &quot;Head of the captaincy&quot;. The new capital was established on 23 April 1683, with public celebrations.

====The Bandeirantes====

In the 17th century, São Paulo was one of the poorest regions of the Portuguese colony. It was also the center of interior colonial development. Because they were extremely poor, the Paulistas could not afford to buy African slaves, as did other Portuguese colonists. The discovery of gold in the region of Minas Gerais, in the 1690s, brought attention and new settlers to São Paulo. The Captaincy of São Paulo and Minas de Ouro (see Captaincies of Brazil) was created on 3 November 1709, when the Portuguese crown purchased the Captaincies of São Paulo and Santo Amaro from the former grantees.

Conveniently located in the country, up the steep &quot;Serra do Mar&quot; escarpment/mountain range when traveling from Santos, while also not too far from the coastline, São Paulo became a safe place to stay for tired travelers. The town became a center for the &quot;bandeirantes&quot;, intrepid invaders who marched into unknown lands in search for gold, diamonds, precious stones, and Indians to enslave. The &quot;bandeirantes&quot;, which could be translated as &quot;flag-bearers&quot; or &quot;flag-followers&quot;, organized excursions into the land with the primary purpose of profit and the expansion of territory for the Portuguese crown. Trade grew from the local markets and from providing food and accommodation for explorers. The &quot;bandeirantes&quot; eventually became politically powerful as a group, and forced the expulsion of the Jesuits from the city of São Paulo in 1640. The two groups had frequently come into conflict because of the Jesuits&#x27; opposition to the domestic slave trade in Indians.
On 11 July 1711, the town of São Paulo was elevated to city status. Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiabá and Goiânia. The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the Tordesillas Line to incorporate the gold regions. When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, São Paulo shifted to growing sugar cane. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the Port of Santos. At that time, the first modern highway between São Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Calçada do Lorena &quot;(&quot;Lorena&#x27;s settway&quot;)&quot;. Nowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor of the State of São Paulo, in the city of São Paulo, is called the &quot;Palácio dos Bandeirantes&quot; (Bandeirantes Palace), in the neighborhood of Morumbi.

===Imperial period===


After Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, as declared by Emperor Pedro I where the Monument to the Independence of Brazil is located, he named São Paulo as an Imperial City. In 1827, a law school was founded at the Convent of São Francisco, today part of the University of São Paulo. The influx of students and teachers gave a new impetus to the city&#x27;s growth, thanks to which the city became the &quot;Imperial City and Borough of Students of St. Paul of Piratininga&quot;.

The expansion of coffee production was a major factor in the growth of São Paulo, as it became the region&#x27;s chief export crop and yielded good revenue. It was cultivated initially in the Paraíba Valley region in the East of the State of São Paulo, and later on in the regions of Campinas, Rio Claro, São Carlos and Ribeirão Preto.

From 1869 onward, São Paulo was connected to the port of Santos by the Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundiaí (Santos-Jundiaí Railroad), nicknamed&quot; The Lady&quot;. In the late 19th century, several other railroads connected the interior to the state capital. São Paulo became the point of convergence of all railroads from the interior of the state. Coffee was the economic engine for major economic and population growth in the State of São Paulo.

In 1888, the &quot;Golden Law&quot; (&quot;Lei Áurea&quot;) was sanctioned by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, abolishing the institution of slavery in Brazil. Slaves were the main source of labor in the coffee plantations until then. As a consequence of this law, and following governmental stimulus towards the increase of immigration, the province began to receive a large number of immigrants, largely Italians, Japanese and Portuguese peasants, many of whom settled in the capital. The region&#x27;s first industries also began to emerge, providing jobs to the newcomers, especially those who had to learn Portuguese.

===Old Republican period===

By the time Brazil became a republic on 15 November 1889, coffee exports were still an important part of São Paulo&#x27;s economy. São Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing Brazilian presidents, an alliance that became known as &quot;coffee and milk&quot;, given that Minas Gerais was famous for its dairy production. During this period, São Paulo went from regional center to national metropolis, becoming industrialized and reaching its first million inhabitants in 1928. Its greatest growth in this period was relative in the 1890s when it doubled its population. The height of the coffee period is represented by the construction of the second Luz Station (the present building) at the end of the 19th century and by the Paulista Avenue in 1900, where they built many mansions.
Industrialization was the economic cycle that followed the coffee plantation model. By the hands of some industrious families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories began to arise and São Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air. The cultural scene followed modernist and naturalist tendencies in fashion at the beginning of the 20th century. Some examples of notable modernist artists are poets Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade, artists Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral and Lasar Segall, and sculptor Victor Brecheret. The Modern Art Week of 1922 that took place at the Theatro Municipal was an event marked by avant-garde ideas and works of art. In 1929, São Paulo won its first skyscraper, the Martinelli Building.

The modifications made in the city by Antônio da Silva Prado, Baron of Duprat and Washington Luís, who governed from 1899 to 1919, contributed to the climate development of the city; some scholars consider that the entire city was demolished and rebuilt at that time. São Paulo&#x27;s main economic activities derive from the services industry – factories are since long gone, and in came financial services institutions, law firms, consulting firms. Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as Barra Funda and Brás. Some cities around São Paulo, such as Diadema, São Bernardo do Campo, Santo André, and Cubatão are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.

In 1924 the city was the stage of the São Paulo Revolt, an armed conflict fought in working-class neighborhoods near the center of São Paulo that lasted 23 days, from 5 to 28 July, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured. The confrontation between the federal troops of president Artur Bernardes against rebels of the Brazilian Army and the Public Force of São Paulo was classified by the federal government as a conspiracy, a mutiny and a &quot;revolt against the Fatherland, without foundation, headed by disorderly members of the Brazilian Army&quot;. To face the rebels, the federal government launched an indiscriminate artillery bombardment against the city, which affected mostly civilian targets; as a result of the bombing, a third of São Paulo&#x27;s 700,000 inhabitants fled the city. The revolt has been described as &quot;the largest urban conflict in the history of Brazil&quot;.

===Revolution of 1932 and contemporary era===


In 1932, São Paulo mobilized in its largest civic movement: the Constitutionalist Revolution, when the entire population engaged in the war against the &quot;Provisional Government&quot; of Getúlio Vargas. In 1934, with the reunion of some faculties created in the 19th century, the University of São Paulo (USP) was founded, today the largest in Brazil.

The first major project for industrial installation in the city was the industrial complex of Indústrias Matarazzo in Barra Funda. In the 1930s, the Jafet brothers, operating in the fabric business, Rodolfo Crespi, the Puglisi Carbone brothers and the Klabin family, who would found the first large cellulose industry in Brazil, the Klabin. Another major industrial boom occurred during the Second World War, due to the crisis in coffee farming in the 1930s and restrictions on international trade during the war, which resulted in the city having a very high economic growth rate that remained high in the post-war period.

In 1947, São Paulo gained its first paved highway: the Via Anchieta (built on the old route of José de Anchieta), connecting the capital to the coast of São Paulo. In the 1950s, São Paulo was known as &quot;the city that never stop&quot; and as &quot;the fastest growing city in the world&quot;. São Paulo held a large celebration, in 1954, of the &quot;Fourth Centenary&quot; of the city&#x27;s founding, when the Ibirapuera Park was inaugurated, many historical books are released and the source of the Tietê River in Salesópolis is discovered. With the transfer of part of the city&#x27;s financial center, which was located in the historic center (in the region called the &quot;Historic Triangle&quot;), to Paulista Avenue, its mansions were, for the most part, replaced by large buildings.
In the period from the 1930s to the 1960s, the great entrepreneurs of São Paulo&#x27;s development were mayor Francisco Prestes Maia and the governor Ademar de Barros, who was also mayor of São Paulo between 1957 and 1961. Prestes Maia designed and implemented, in the 1930s, the &quot;Avenue Plan for the City of São Paulo&quot;, which revolutionized São Paulo&#x27;s traffic. These two rulers are also responsible for the two biggest urban interventions, after the Avenues Plan, which changed São Paulo: the rectification of the Tietê river with the construction of its banks and the São Paulo Metro: on February 13, 1963, governor Ademar de Barros and mayor Prestes Maia created study commissions (state and municipal) to prepare the basic project for the São Paulo Metro, and allocated their first funds to the Metro. At the beginning of the 1960s, São Paulo already had four million inhabitants. Construction of the metro began in 1968, under the administration of Mayor José Vicente de Faria Lima, and the commercial operation started on September 14, 1974. In 2016 the system had a network 71.5 km long and 64 stations spread across five lines. That year, 1.1 billion passengers were transported by the system.

At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, São Paulo became the main financial center in South America and one of the most populous cities in the world. As the most influential Brazilian city on the global stage, São Paulo is currently classified as an alpha global city. The metropolis has one of the largest GDP in the world, representing, alone, 11% of all Brazilian GDP, and is also responsible for one third of the Brazilian scientific production.

==Geography==
São Paulo is the capital of the most populous state in Brazil, São Paulo, located at latitude 23°33&#x27;01&quot; south and longitude 46°38&#x27;02&quot; west. The total area of the municipality is , according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), being the ninth largest in the state in terms of territorial extension. Of the entire area of the municipality, are urban areas (2015), being the largest urban area in the country.

The city is on a plateau placed beyond the Serra do Mar (Portuguese for &quot;Sea Range&quot; or &quot;Coastal Range&quot;), itself a component of the vast region known as the Brazilian Highlands, with an average elevation of around above sea level, although being at a distance of only about from the Atlantic Ocean. The distance is covered by two highways, the Anchieta and the Imigrantes, (see &quot;Transportation&quot; below) that roll down the range, leading to the port city of Santos and the beach resort of Guarujá. Rolling terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of São Paulo except in its northern area, where the Serra da Cantareira Range reaches a higher elevation and a sizable remnant of the Atlantic Rain Forest. The region is seismically stable and no significant activity has ever been recorded.

=== Hydrography ===


The Tietê River and its tributary, the Pinheiros River, were once important sources of fresh water and leisure for São Paulo. However, heavy industrial effluents and wastewater discharges in the later 20th century caused the rivers to become heavily polluted. A substantial clean-up program for both rivers is underway. Neither river is navigable in the stretch that flows through the city, although water transportation becomes increasingly important on the Tietê river further downstream (near river Paraná), as the river is part of the River Plate basin.

No large natural lakes exist in the region, but the Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs in the city&#x27;s southern outskirts are used for power generation, water storage and leisure activities, such as sailing. The original flora consisted mainly of broadleaf evergreens. Non-native species are common, as the mild climate and abundant rainfall permit a multitude of tropical, subtropical and temperate plants to be cultivated, especially the ubiquitous eucalyptus.

The north of the municipality contains part of the Cantareira State Park, created in 1962, which protects a large part of the metropolitan São Paulo water supply. In 2015, São Paulo experienced a major drought, which led several cities in the state to start a rationing system.

=== Parks and biodiversity ===
São Paulo is located in an ecotone area between 3 biomes: mixed ombrophilous forest, dense ombrophilous forest and cerrado; the latter had some plant species native to the pampas in the city. There were several species typical of both biomes, among them we can mention: araucarias, pitangueiras, cambucís, ipês, jabuticabeiras, queen palms, muricís-do-campo, etc.

In 2010, São Paulo had 62 municipal and state parks, such as the Cantareira State Park, part of the São Paulo Green Belt Biosphere Reserve and home to one of the largest urban forests on the planet with of extension, the Fontes do Ipiranga State Park, the Ibirapuera Park, the Tietê Ecological Park, the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area, the Serra do Mar State Park, Villa-Lobos State Park, People&#x27;s Park, and the Jaraguá State Park, listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994.

In 2009, São Paulo had of green area, less than 1.5% of the city&#x27;s area and below the per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). About 21% of the municipality&#x27;s area is covered by green areas, including ecological reserves (2010 data).

In the municipality it is possible to observe forest birds that usually appear in the spring, due to the belt of native forest that still surrounds the metropolitan region. Species such as the rufous-bellied thrush, golden-chevroned tanager, great kiskadee and hummingbird are the most common. Despite the intense pollution, the main rivers of the city, the Tietê and the Pinheiros, shelter several species of animals such as capybaras, hawks, southern lapwings, herons and nutrias. Other species found in the municipality are the gray brocket, howler monkey, green-billed toucan and the Amazonian umbrellabird.

=== Environment ===
Air pollution in some districts of the city exceeds local standards, mainly due to car traffic. The World Health Organization (WHO) sets a limit of 20 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air as a safe annual average. In an assessment carried out by the WHO among over a thousand cities around the world in 2011, the city of São Paulo was ranked 268th among the most polluted, with an average rate of 38 micrograms per cubic meter, a rate well above the limit imposed by the organization, but lower than in other Brazilian cities, such as Rio de Janeiro (64 micrograms per cubic meter). A 2013 study found that air pollution in the city causes more deaths than traffic accidents.

The stretch of the Tietê River that runs through the city is the most polluted river in Brazil. In 1992, the Tietê Project began, with the aim to clean up the river by 2005. 8.8 billion reais was spent on the failed project. In 2019, the Novo Rio Pinheiros Project began, under the administration of João Doria, with the aim to reduce sewage discharged into the Tietê&#x27;s tributary, the Pinheiros River.

The problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: São Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins. The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport – leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen classification, the city has a temperate humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;, bordering on &quot;Cwa&quot;). In summer (January through March), the mean low temperature is about and the mean high temperatures is near . In winter, temperatures tend to range between . The record high temperature was on 17 October 2014 and the lowest on 25 June 1918. The Tropic of Capricorn, at about 23°27&#x27; S, passes through north of São Paulo and roughly marks the boundary between the tropical and temperate areas of South America. Because of its elevation, however, São Paulo experiences a more temperate climate. The summer is warm and rainy. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winter is mild, but still the coldest season, with cloudiness around town and frequent polar air masses. Frosts occur sporadically in regions further away from the center, in some winters throughout the city.

Rainfall is abundant, annually averaging . It is especially common in the warmer months averaging and decreases in winter, averaging . Neither São Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a tropical cyclone and tornadic activity is uncommon. During late winter, especially August, the city experiences the phenomenon known as &quot;veranico&quot; or &quot;verãozinho&quot; (&quot;little summer&quot;), which consists of hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching temperatures well above . On the other hand, relatively cool days during summer are fairly common when persistent winds blow from the ocean. On such occasions daily high temperatures may not surpass , accompanied by lows often below , however, summer can be extremely hot when a heat wave hits the city followed by temperatures around , but in places with greater skyscraper density and less tree cover, the temperature can feel like , as on Paulista Avenue for example. In the summer of 2014, São Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above , peaking on . Secondary to deforestation, groundwater pollution, and climate change, São Paulo is increasingly susceptible to drought and water shortages.
==Demographics==
São Paulo&#x27;s population has grown rapidly. By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil&#x27;s most populous city. By this time, the urbanized area of São Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million. Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed.

In 2013, São Paulo was the most populous city in Brazil and in South America. According to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 11,244,369 people residing in the city of São Paulo. Portuguese remains the most widely spoken language and São Paulo is the largest city in the Portuguese speaking world. 
In 2010, the city had 2,146,077 opposite-sex couples and 7,532 same-sex couples. The population of São Paulo was 52.6% female and 47.4% male. The 2022 census found 6,214,422 White people (54.3%), 3,820,326 Pardo (multiracial) people (33.4%), 1,160,073 Black people (10.1%), 238,603 Asian people (2.1%) and 17,727 Amerindian people (0.2%).

===Immigration and migration===
São Paulo is considered the most multicultural city in Brazil. From 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3 million immigrants arrived in the state, from all parts of the world. The Italian community is one of the strongest, with a presence throughout the city. Of the 12 million inhabitants of São Paulo, 50% (6 million people) have full or partial Italian ancestry. São Paulo has more descendants of Italians than any Italian city (the largest city of Italy is Rome, with 2.8 million inhabitants).

The main groups, considering all the metropolitan area, are: 6 million people of Italian descent, 3 million people of Portuguese descent, 1.7 million people of African descent, 1 million people of Arab descent, 665,000 people of Japanese descent, 400,000 people of German descent, 250,000 people of French descent, 150,000 people of Greek descent, 120,000 people of Chinese descent, 120,000–300,000 Bolivian immigrants, 50,000 people of Korean descent, and 80,000 Jews.

Even today, Italians are grouped in neighborhoods like Bixiga, Brás, and Mooca to promote celebrations and festivals. In the early twentieth century, Italian and its dialects were spoken almost as much as Portuguese in the city, which influenced the formation of the São Paulo dialect of today. Six thousand pizzerias are producing about a million pizzas a day. Brazil has the largest Italian population outside Italy, with São Paulo being the most populous city with Italian ancestry in the world.

The Portuguese community is also large; it is estimated that three million paulistanos have some origin in Portugal. The Jewish colony is more than 80,000 people in São Paulo and is concentrated mainly in Higienópolis and Bom Retiro.

From the nineteenth century through the first half of the twentieth century, São Paulo also received German immigrants (in the current neighborhood of Santo Amaro), Spanish and Lithuanian (in the neighborhood Vila Zelina).

Until 1920, 1,078,437 Italians entered in the State of São Paulo. Of the immigrants who arrived there between 1887 and 1902, 63.5% came from Italy. Between 1888 and 1919, 44.7% of the immigrants were Italians, 19.2% were Spaniards and 15.4% were Portuguese. In 1920, nearly 80% of São Paulo city&#x27;s population was composed of immigrants and their descendants and Italians made up over half of its male population. At that time, the Governor of São Paulo said that &quot;if the owner of each house in São Paulo display the flag of the country of origin on the roof, from above São Paulo would look like an Italian city&quot;. In 1900, a columnist who was absent from São Paulo for 20 years wrote &quot;then São Paulo used to be a genuine Paulista city, today it is an Italian city.&quot;

São Paulo also is home of the largest Japanese community outside Japan. In 1958 the census counted 120,000 Japanese in the city and by 1987, there were 326,000 with another 170,000 in the surrounding areas within São Paulo state. As of 2007, the Paulistano Japanese population outnumbered their fellow diaspora in the entirety of Peru, and in all individual American cities.

Research conducted by the University of São Paulo (USP) shows the city&#x27;s high ethnic diversity: when asked if they are &quot;descendants of foreign immigrants&quot;, 81% of the students reported &quot;yes&quot;. The main reported ancestries were: Italian (30.5%), Portuguese (23%), Spanish (14%), Japanese (8%), German (6%), &quot;Brazilian&quot; (4%), African (3%), Arab (2%) and Jewish (1%).

The city once attracted numerous immigrants from all over Brazil and even from foreign countries, due to a strong economy and for being the hub of most Brazilian companies. São Paulo is also receiving waves of immigration from Haiti and from many countries of Africa and the Caribbean. Those immigrants are mainly concentrated in Praça da Sé, Glicério and Vale do Anhangabaú in the Central Zone of São Paulo.

Since the 19th century people began migrating from northeastern Brazil into São Paulo. This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants was found in the area of Sé/Brás (districts of Brás, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, Pari and Sé). In this area they composed 41% of the population.

===Metropolitan area===
The nonspecific term &quot;Grande São Paulo&quot; (&quot;Greater São Paulo&quot;) covers multiple definitions. The legally defined &quot;Região Metropolitana de São Paulo&quot; consists of 39 municipalities in total and a population of 21.1 million inhabitants ().

Because São Paulo has urban sprawl, it uses a different definition for its metropolitan area alternately called the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo and the São Paulo Macrometropolis. Analogous to the BosWash definition, it is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world, with 32 million inhabitants, behind Tokyo, which includes four contiguous legally defined metropolitan regions and three micro-regions.

===Religion===

Like the cultural variety verifiable in São Paulo, there are several religious manifestations present in the city. Although it has developed on an eminently Catholic social matrix, both due to colonization and immigration – and even today most of the people of São Paulo declare themselves Roman Catholic – it is possible to find in the city dozens of different Protestant denominations, as well as the practice of Islam, Spiritism, among others. Buddhism and Eastern religions also have relevance among the beliefs most practiced by Paulistanos. It is estimated that there are more than one hundred thousand Buddhist and Hindu followers each. Also considerable are Judaism, Mormonism and Afro-Brazilian religions.

According to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2010 the population of São Paulo was 6,549,775 Roman Catholics (58.2%), 2,887,810 Protestants (22.1%), 531,822 Spiritists (4.7%), 101,493 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (0.9%), 75,075 Buddhists (0.7%), 50,794 Umbandists (0.5%), 43,610 Jews (0.4%), 28,673 Catholic Apostolic Brazilians (0.3%), 25,583 eastern religious (0.2%), 18,058 Candomblecists (0.2%), 17,321 Mormons (0.2%), 14,894 Eastern Orthodox (0.1%), 9,119 spiritualists (0.1%), 8,277 Muslims (0.1%), 7,139 esoteric (0.1%), 1,829 practiced Indian traditions (&lt;0.1%) and 1,008 were Hindu (&lt;0.1%). Others 1,056 008 had no religion (9.4%), 149,628 followed other Christian religiosities (1.3%), 55,978 had an undetermined religion or multiple belonging (0.5%), 14,127 did not know (0.1%) And 1,896 reported following other religiosities (&lt;0.1%).

The Catholic Church divides the territory of the municipality of São Paulo into four ecclesiastical circumscriptions: the Archdiocese of São Paulo, and the adjacent Diocese of Santo Amaro, the Diocese of São Miguel Paulista and the Diocese of Campo Limpo, the last three suffragans of the first. The archive of the archdiocese, called the Metropolitan Archival Dom Duarte Leopoldo e Silva, in the Ipiranga neighborhood, holds one of the most important documentary heritage in Brazil. The archiepiscopal is the Metropolitan Cathedral of São Paulo (known as Sé Cathedral), in Praça da Sé, considered one of the five largest Gothic temples in the world. The Catholic Church recognizes as patron saints of the city Saint Paul of Tarsus and Our Lady of Penha of France.

The city has the most diverse Protestant or Reformed creeds, such as the Evangelical Community of Our Land, Maranatha Christian Church, Lutheran Church, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church, Anglican Episcopal Church, Baptist churches, Assemblies of God in Brazil (the largest evangelical church in the country), The Seventh-day Adventist Church, the World Church of God&#x27;s Power, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others, as well as Christians of various denominations. &quot;

===Public security===

In 2008, the city of São Paulo ranked 493rd on the list of the most violent cities in Brazil. Among the capitals, it was the fourth least violent, registering, in 2006, homicide rates higher only than those of Boa Vista, Palmas and Natal. In November 2009, the Ministry of Justice and the Brazilian Public Security Forum released a survey that identified São Paulo as the safest Brazilian capital for young people. Between 2000 and 2010, the city of São Paulo reduced its homicide rate by 78%.

According to the 2011 Global Homicide Study, released by the United Nations (UN), in the period between 2004 and 2009 the homicide rate fell from 20.8 to 10.8 murders per hundred thousand inhabitants. In 2011, the UN pointed to São Paulo as an example of how large cities can reduce crime. In a survey on the Adolescent Homicide Index (AHI) in 2010, the city of São Paulo was considered the least lethal for adolescents, among 283 municipalities surveyed, with more than 100,000 inhabitants. According to data from the &quot;Map of Violence 2011&quot;, published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the city had the lowest homicide rate per hundred thousand inhabitants that year among all the state capitals in Brazil.

Crime indicators, such as homicide, according to data from April 2017, showed a reduction in the capital of São Paulo, compared to 2016. In the same period, there was a 12.64% reduction in homicides, the number of robbery records fell by eleven to seven (34% reduction), and there was an 8.09% reduction in rape cases. The 9th DP in the Carandiru neighborhood was considered, in March 2007, one of the five best police stations in the world and the best in Latin America.

Based on data from IBGE and the Ministry of Health, it is considered the 2nd safest capital and the least lethal capital in the country, according to the 2023 Brazilian Public Security Yearbook.

===Social challenges===

Since the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America. During two World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected. This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned São Paulo into Brazil&#x27;s largest industrial hub.
* Crime rates consistently decreased in the 21st century. The citywide homicide rate was 6.56 in 2019, less than a fourth of the 27.38 national rate.
* Air quality has steadily increased during the modern era.
* The two major rivers crossing the city, Tietê and Pinheiros, are highly polluted. A major project to clean up these rivers is underway.
* The Clean City Law or antibillboard, approved in 2007, focused on two main targets: anti-publicity and anti-commerce. Advertisers estimate that they removed 15,000 billboards and that more than 1,600 signs and 1,300 towering metal panels were dismantled by authorities.
* São Paulo metropolitan region, adopted vehicle restrictions from 1996 to 1998 to reduce air pollution during wintertime. Since 1997, a similar project was implemented throughout the year in the central area of São Paulo to improve traffic.
* There were more than 30,000 homeless people in 2021 according to official data. It increased by 31% in two years, and doubled in 20 years.

===Languages===
The primary language is Portuguese. The general language from São Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages.
The Italian influence in São Paulo accents is evident in the Italian neighborhoods such as Bela Vista, Mooca, Brás and Lapa. Italian mingled with Portuguese and as an old influence, was assimilated or disappeared into spoken language. The local accent with Italian influences became notorious through the songs of Adoniran Barbosa, a Brazilian samba singer born to Italian parents who used to sing using the local accent.

Other languages spoken in the city are mainly among the Asian community: São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan. Although today most Japanese-Brazilians speak only Portuguese, some of them are still fluent in Japanese. Some people of Chinese and Korean descent are still able to speak their ancestral languages. In some areas it is still possible to find descendants of immigrants who speak German (especially in the area of Brooklin paulista) and Lithuanian or Russian or East European languages (especially in the area of Vila Zelina). In the west zone of São Paulo, specially at Vila Anastácio and Lapa region, there is a Hungarian colony, with three churches (Calvinist, Baptist and Catholic), so on Sundays it is possible to see Hungarians talking to each other on sidewalks.

===Sexual diversity===

The Greater São Paulo is home to a prominent self-identifying gay, bisexual and transgender community, with 9.6% of the male population and 7% of the female population declaring themselves to be non-heterosexual. Same-sex civil unions have been legal in the whole country since 5 May 2011, while same-sex marriage in São Paulo was legalized on 18 December 2012. Since 1997, the city has hosted the annual São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, considered the biggest pride parade in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records with over 5 million participants, and typically rivalling the New York City Pride March for the record.

Strongly supported by the State and the City of São Paulo government authorities, in 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested R$1 million reais in the parade and provided a solid security plan, with approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds. The parade, considered the city&#x27;s second largest event after the Formula One, begins at the São Paulo Museum of Art, crosses Paulista Avenue, and follows Consolação Street to Praça Roosevelt in Downtown São Paulo. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best in the world.

===Education===

São Paulo has public and private primary and secondary schools and vocational-technical schools. More than nine-tenths of the population are literate and roughly the same proportion of those age 7 to 14 are enrolled in school. There are 578 universities in the state of São Paulo.

The city of São Paulo is also home to research and development facilities and attracts companies due to the presence of regionally renowned universities. Science, technology and innovation is leveraged by the allocation of funds from the state government, mainly carried out by means of the Foundation to Research Support in the State of São Paulo (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo – FAPESP), one of the main agencies promoting scientific and technological research.
===Health care===


São Paulo is one of the largest health care hubs in Latin America. Among its hospitals are the Albert Einstein Israelites Hospital, ranked the best hospital in all Latin America and the Hospital das Clínicas, the largest in the region, with a total area of 600,000 square meters and offers 2,400 beds, distributed among its eight specialized institutes and two assisting hospitals.

The main hospitals in the city of São Paulo concentrate in the upper-income areas, the majority of the population of the city has a private health insurance. This can includes hospitals, private practices and pharmacies. The city of São Paulo has the largest number of foreigners comparing with any other Brazilian city and an intense health tourism. In Brazil, the city of São Paulo has the largest number of doctors who can speak more than one language, which in this case is Portuguese, with the secondary languages predominantly are English and Spanish.

The private health care sector is very large and most of Brazil&#x27;s best hospitals are in the city. As of September 2009, the city of São Paulo had: 32,553 ambulatory clinics, centers and professional offices (physicians, dentists and others); 217 hospitals, with 32,554 beds; 137,745 health care professionals, including 28,316 physicians.

The municipal government operates public health facilities across the city&#x27;s territory, with 770 primary health care units (UBS), ambulatory and emergency clinics and 17 hospitals. The Municipal Secretary of Health has 59,000 employees, including 8,000 physicians and 12,000 nurses. 6,000,000 citizens uses the facilities, which provide drugs at no cost and manage an extensive family health program (PSF – Programa de Saúde da Família).

The Sistema Integrado de Gestão de Assistência à Saúde de São Paulo – SIGA Saúde (&quot;Integrated Health Care Management System in São Paulo&quot;) has been operating in the city of São Paulo since 2004. Today there are more than 22 million registered users, including the people of the Greater São Paulo, with a monthly average of 1.3 million appointments.

==Government==


As the capital of the state of São Paulo, the city is home to the Bandeirantes Palace (state government) and the Legislative Assembly. The Executive Branch of the municipality of São Paulo is represented by the mayor and his cabinet of secretaries, following the model proposed by the Federal Constitution. The organic law of the municipality and the Master Plan of the city, however, determine that the public administration must guarantee to the population effective tools of manifestation of participatory democracy, which causes that the city is divided in regional prefectures, each one led by a Regional Mayor appointed by the Mayor.

The legislative power is represented by the Municipal Chamber, composed of 55 aldermen elected to four-year posts (in compliance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Constitution, which dictates a minimum number of 42 and a maximum of 55 for municipalities with more than five million inhabitants). It is up to the house to draft and vote fundamental laws for the administration and the Executive, especially the municipal budget (known as the Law of Budgetary Guidelines). In addition to the legislative process and the work of the secretariats, there are also a number of municipal councils, each dealing with different topics, composed of representatives of the various sectors of organized civil society. The actual performance and representativeness of such councils, however, are sometimes questioned.

The following municipal councils are active: Municipal Council for Children and Adolescents (CMDCA); of Informatics (WCC); of the Physically Disabled (CMDP); of Education (CME); of Housing (CMH); of Environment (CADES); of Health (CMS); of Tourism (COMTUR); of Human Rights (CMDH); of Culture (CMC); and of Social Assistance (COMAS) and Drugs and Alcohol (COMUDA). The Prefecture also owns (or is the majority partner in their social capital) a series of companies responsible for various aspects of public services and the economy of São Paulo:
* &quot;São Paulo Turismo S/A&quot; (SPTuris): company responsible for organizing large events and promoting the city&#x27;s tourism.
* &quot;Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego&quot; (CET): subordinated to the Municipal Transportation Department, is responsible for traffic supervision, fines (in cooperation with DETRAN) and maintenance of the city&#x27;s road system.
* &quot;Companhia Metropolitana de Habitação de São Paulo&quot; (COHAB): subordinate to the Department of Housing, is responsible for the implementation of public housing policies, especially the construction of housing developments.
* &quot;Empresa Municipal de Urbanização de São Paulo&quot; (EMURB): subordinate to the Planning Department, is responsible for urban works and for the maintenance of public spaces and urban furniture.
* &quot;Companhia de Processamento de Dados de São Paulo&quot; (PRODAM): responsible for the electronic infrastructure and information technology of the city hall.
* &quot;São Paulo Transportes Sociedade Anônima&quot; (SPTrans): responsible for the operation of the public transport systems managed by the city hall, such as the municipal bus lines.

===Subdivisions===
São Paulo is divided into 32 subprefectures, each with an administration (&quot;subprefeitura&quot;) divided into several districts (&quot;distritos&quot;). The city also has a radial division into nine zones for purpose of traffic control and bus lines, which do not fit into the administrative divisions. These zones are identified by colors in the street signs. The historical core of São Paulo, which includes the inner city and the area of Paulista Avenue, is in the Subprefecture of Sé. Most other economic and tourist facilities of the city are inside an area officially called &quot;Centro Expandido&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;Broad Center&quot;, or &quot;Broad Downtown&quot;), which includes Sé and several other subprefectures, and areas immediately around it.

==Economy==

São Paulo is Brazil&#x27;s highest GDP city and one of the largest in the world. According to data from the IBGE, its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 was R$450 billion, approximately billion, 12.26% of Brazilian GDP and 36% of the São Paulo state&#x27;s GDP. The per capita income for the city was R$32,493 in 2008.

São Paulo is considered the financial capital of Brazil, as it is the location for the headquarters of major corporations and of banks and financial institutions. The city is the headquarters of B3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization, and has several financial districts, mainly in the areas around Paulista, Faria Lima and Berrini avenues. 63% of all the international companies with business in Brazil have their head offices in São Paulo. São Paulo has one of the largest concentrations of German businesses worldwide and is the largest Swedish industrial hub alongside Gothenburg.

, São Paulo is the third largest exporting municipality in Brazil after Parauapebas, PA and Rio de Janeiro, RJ. In that year São Paulo&#x27;s exported goods totaled $7.32B (USD) or 3.02% of Brazil&#x27;s total exports. The top five commodities exported by São Paulo are soybean (21%), raw sugar (19%), coffee (6.5%), sulfate chemical wood pulp (5.6%), and corn (4.4%).

São Paulo&#x27;s economy is going through a deep transformation. Once a city with a strong industrial character, São Paulo&#x27;s economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary sector of the economy, focusing on services. São Paulo also has a large &quot;informal&quot; economy. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers average annual economic growth of the city is 4.2%. In 2005, the city of São Paulo collected R$90 billion in taxes and the city budget was R$15 billion. The city has 1,500 bank branches and 70 shopping malls.

The city is unique among Brazilian cities for its large number of foreign corporations. São Paulo ranked second after New York in FDi magazine&#x27;s bi-annual ranking of Cities of the Future 2013–14 in the Americas, and was named the Latin American City of the Future 2013–14. According to Mercer&#x27;s 2011 city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, São Paulo is among the ten most expensive cities in the world.

Luxury brands tend to concentrate their business in São Paulo. Because of the lack of department stores and multi-brand boutiques, shopping malls as well as the Jardins district attract most of the world&#x27;s luxurious brands. Most of the international luxury brands can be found in the Iguatemi, Cidade Jardim or JK shopping malls or on the streets of Oscar Freire, Lorena or Haddock Lobo in the Jardins district. They are home of brands such as Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Tiffany &amp; Co. Cidade Jardim was opened in São Paulo in 2008, it is a mall, landscaped with trees and greenery scenario, with a focus on Brazilian brands but also home to international luxury brands such as Hermès, Jimmy Choo, Pucci and Carolina Herrera. Opened in 2012, JK shopping mall has brought to Brazil brands that were not present in the country before such as Goyard, Tory Burch, Llc., Prada, and Miu Miu.

The Iguatemi Faria Lima, in Faria Lima Avenue, is Brazil&#x27;s oldest mall, opened in 1966. The Jardins neighborhood is regarded among the most sophisticated places in town, with upscale restaurants and hotels. The New York Times once compared Oscar Freire Street to Rodeo Drive. In Jardins there are luxury car dealers. One of the world&#x27;s best restaurants as elected by The World&#x27;s 50 Best Restaurants Award, D.O.M., is there.

=== Tourism ===
Large hotel chains whose target audience is the corporate traveler are in the city. São Paulo is home to 75% of the country&#x27;s leading business fairs. The city also promotes one of the most important fashion weeks in the world, São Paulo Fashion Week, established in 1996 under the name Morumbi Fashion Brasil, is the largest and most important fashion event in Latin America. Besides, the São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, held since 1997 on Paulista Avenue is the event that attracts more tourists to the city.

The annual March For Jesus is a large gathering of Christians from Protestant churches throughout Brazil, with São Paulo police reporting participation in the range of 350,000 in 2015. In addition, São Paulo hosts the annual São Paulo Pancake Cook-Off in which chefs from across Brazil and the world participate in competitions based on the cooking of pancakes.

Cultural tourism also has relevance to the city, especially when considering the international events in the metropolis, such as the São Paulo Art Biennial, that attracted almost 1 million people in 2004.

The city has a nightlife that is considered one of the best in the country, and is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight. There are cinemas, theaters, museums, and cultural centers. The Rua Oscar Freire was named one of the eight most luxurious streets in the world, according to the Mystery Shopping International, and São Paulo the 25th &quot;most expensive city&quot; of the planet.

According to the International Congress &amp; Convention Association, São Paulo ranks first among the cities that host international events in Americas and the 12th in the world, after Vienna, Paris, Barcelona, Singapore, Berlin, Budapest, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Seoul, Lisbon, and Copenhagen. 

According to a study by MasterCard in 130 cities around the world, São Paulo was the third most visited destination in Latin America (behind Mexico City and Buenos Aires) with 2.4 million foreign travelers, who spent US$2.9 billion in 2013 (the highest among the cities in the region). In 2014, CNN ranked nightlife São Paulo as the fourth best in the world, behind New York City, Berlin and Ibiza, in Spain.

The cuisine of the region is a tourist attraction. The city has 62 cuisines across 12,000 restaurants. During the 10th International Congress of Gastronomy, Hospitality and Tourism (Cihat) conducted in 1997, the city received the title of &quot;World Gastronomy Capital&quot; from a commission formed by 43 nations&#x27; representatives.

==Urban infrastructure==

Since the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been one of the main economic centers of Latin America. With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy) and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states. From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.

São Paulo is practically all served by the water supply network. The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos. Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.

===Urban planning===

São Paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics. The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, São Paulo is considered a &quot;low-rise building&quot; city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings &quot;Emporis Buildings&quot;, besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as &quot;Palácio Zarzur Kogan&quot;, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.

Such tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine. Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, drug trafficking, street vending and prostitution, which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.

São Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.

Urban growth in São Paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th century and until the 1940s, São Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, São Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security. Thus, São Paulo differs considerably from other Brazilian cities such as Belo Horizonte and Goiânia, whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan, or a city like Brasília, whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction.

The effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable. Some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes. In São Paulo until the mid-1950s, the plans were based on the idea of &quot;demolish and rebuild&quot;, including former Mayor Francisco Prestes Maia&#x27;s road plan for São Paulo (known as the Avenues Plan) or Saturnino de Brito&#x27;s plan for the Tietê River. The Plan of the Avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts. This plan included renewing the commercial city center, leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods. The plan also led to the expansion of bus services, which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system. This contributed to the outwards expansion of São Paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents. Peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of self-built single-family houses.

In 1968 the Urban Development Plan proposed the Basic Plan for Integrated Development of São Paulo, under the administration of Figueiredo Ferraz. The main result was zoning laws. It lasted until 2004 when the Basic Plan was replaced by the current Master Plan. That zoning, adopted in 1972, designated &quot;Z1&quot; areas (residential areas designed for elites) and &quot;Z3&quot; (a &quot;mixed zone&quot; lacking clear definitions about their characteristics). Zoning encouraged the growth of suburbs with minimal control and major speculation. After the 1970s peripheral lot regulation increased and infrastructure in the periphery improved, driving land prices up. The poorest and the newcomers now could not purchase their lot and build their house, and were forced to look for a housing alternative. As a result, favelas and precarious tenements (cortiços) appeared. These housing types were often closer to the city&#x27;s center: favelas could sprawl in any unused terrain (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization – alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges. By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo&#x27;s population lived in favelas, compared to 5.2% in 1980. Today, it is estimated that 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, which represents about 11% of the metropolitan area&#x27;s population.
===Transport===
====Air====
São Paulo has two main airports, São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport for international flights and national hub, and São Paulo–Congonhas Airport for domestic and regional flights.

==Culture==
===Music===
Adoniran Barbosa was a samba singer and composer who became successful during São Paulo&#x27;s early radio era. Born in 1912 in the town of Valinhos, Barbosa was known as the &quot;composer to the masses&quot;, particularly Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bela Vista, also known as &quot;Bexiga&quot; and Brás, as well as those who lived in the city&#x27;s many &#x27;cortiços&#x27; or tenements. His songs drew from the life of urban workers, the unemployed and those who lived on the edge. His first big hit was &quot;Saudosa Maloca&quot; (&quot;Shanty of Fond Memories&quot; – 1951), wherein three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty home, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. His 1964 Trem das Onze (&quot;The 11 pm Train&quot;), became one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the Jaçanã suburb, for his mother will not sleep before he arrives home. Another important musician with a similar style is Paulo Vanzolini. Vanzolini is a PhD in biology and a part-time professional musician. He composed a song depicting a love murder scene in São Paulo called &quot;Ronda&quot;.

In the late 1960s, a psychedelic rock band called Os Mutantes became popular. Their success is related to that of other tropicalia musicians. The group was known as very &quot;paulistanos&quot; in its behavior and clothing. Os Mutantes released five albums before lead singer Rita Lee departed in 1972 to join another group called Tutti Frutti. Although initially known only in Brazil, Os Mutantes became successful abroad after the 1990s. In 2000, &quot;Tecnicolor&quot;, an album recorded in the early 1970s in English by the band, was released with artwork designed by Sean Lennon.

In the early 1980s, a band called &quot;Ultraje a Rigor&quot; (Elegant Outrage) emerged. They played a simple and irreverent style of rock. The lyrics depicted the changes in society and culture that Brazilian society was experiencing. A late punk and garage scene became strong in the 1980s, perhaps associated with the gloomy scenario of unemployment during an extended recession. Bands originating from this movement include Ira!, Titãs, Ratos de Porão and Inocentes. In the 1990s, drum and bass arose as another musical movement in São Paulo, with artists such as DJ Marky, DJ Patife, XRS, Drumagick and Fernanda Porto. Many heavy metal bands also originated in São Paulo, such as Angra, Project46, Torture Squad, Korzus and Dr. Sin. Famous electro-pop band Cansei de Ser Sexy, or CSS (Portuguese for &quot;tired of being sexy&quot;) also has its origins in the city.

Many of the most important classical Brazilian living composers, such as Amaral Vieira, Osvaldo Lacerda and Edson Zampronha, were born and live in São Paulo. Local baritone Paulo Szot has won international acclaim performing for six consecutive seasons at The Metropolitan Opera, La Scala and Opera de Paris, among others; and The Tony Award for best actor in a musical for his performance in a 2008 revival of &quot;South Pacific&quot;. The São Paulo State Symphony is one of the world&#x27;s outstanding orchestras; their artistic director beginning in 2012 is the noted American conductor Marin Alsop. In 1952, Heitor Villa-Lobos wrote his Symphony Number 10 (&#x27;Ameríndia&#x27;) for the 400th anniversary of São Paulo: an allegorical, historical and religious account of the city told through the eyes of its founder José de Anchieta.

São Paulo&#x27;s opera houses are: São Paulo Municipal Theater, Theatro São Pedro and Alfa Theater, for the symphonic concerts there is the Sala São Paulo, the latter being the headquarters of OSESP, an orchestra.

The auditorium of the Latin-American Cultural Center, The Mozarteum, holds concerts through the year. Festivals as the Virada Cultural (Cultural Overnight) happen once a year and holds hundreds of attractions spread throughout the city.

===Literature===


São Paulo was home to the first Jesuit missionaries in Brazil, in the early 16th century. They wrote reports to the Portuguese crown about the newly found land, the native peoples and composed poetry and music for the catechism, creating the first written works from the area. The literary priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and José de Anchieta, living in or near the colony then called &quot;Piratininga&quot;. They also helped to register the Old Tupi language, lexicon and its grammar.
In 1922, the Brazilian Modernist Movement, launched in São Paulo, began to achieve cultural independence. Brazil had gone through the same stages of development as the rest of Latin America, but its political and cultural independence came more gradually.

Brazilian elite culture was originally strongly tied to Portugal. Gradually writers developed a multi-ethnic body of work that was distinctively Brazilian. The presence of large numbers of former slaves added a distinctive African character to the culture. Subsequent infusions of immigrants of non-Portuguese origin broadened the range of influences.

Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade were the prototypical modernists. With the urban poems of &quot;Paulicéia Desvairada&quot; and &quot;Carefree Paulistan land&quot; (1922), Mário de Andrade established the movement in Brazil. His rhapsodic novel &quot;Macunaíma&quot; (1928), with its abundance of Brazilian folklore, represents the apex of modernism&#x27;s nationalist prose through its creation of an offbeat native national hero. Oswald de Andrade&#x27;s experimental poetry, avant-garde prose, particularly the novel Serafim Ponte Grande (1933) and provocative manifestos exemplify the movement&#x27;s break with tradition.

Modernist artists and writers chose the Municipal Theatre of São Paulo to launch their Modernist manifesto. The site happened to be a bastion of European culture with opera and classical music presentations from Germany, France, Austria and Italy. They defied the high society that frequented the venue and who insisted on speaking only foreign languages such as French, behaving as if Brazilian culture did not matter.

===Theaters===
Many historians believe that the first theatrical performance in Brazil was held in São Paulo. The Portuguese Jesuit missionary José de Anchieta (1534–1597) wrote short plays that were performed and watched by the Tupi–Guarani natives. In the second half of the 19th century a cultural, musical and theatrical life emerged. European ethnic groups began holding performances in some of the state&#x27;s rural cities. The most important period for the art in São Paulo was the 1940s. São Paulo had had a professional company, Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia, (Brazilian Theater of Comedy), along with others.

During the 1960s, major theater productions in São Paulo and Brazil were presented by two groups. Teatro de Arena began with a group of students from Escola de Arte Dramática (Drama Art School), founded by Alfredo Mesquita, in 1948. In 1958, the group excelled with the play &quot;Eles não usam black tie&quot; by Gianfrancesco Guarnieri which was the first in the history of the Brazilian drama to feature labor workers as protagonists.

After the military coup of 1964, plays started focusing on Brazilian history (Zumbi, Tiradentes). Teatro de Arena and Teatro Oficina supported the democratic resistance during the military dictatorship period, marked by its censorship. The Tropicalist movement began there. A number of plays represented historic moments, notably &quot;O Rei da Vela&quot;, &quot;Galileu Galilei&quot; (1968), &quot;Na Selva das Cidades&quot; (1969) and &quot;Gracias Señor&quot; (1972).

The district of Bixiga concentrates the greatest number of theaters, around 40 including the theaters that are closed for refurbishing or for other reasons, and small alternatives companies venues. Some of the most important are Renault, Brigadeiro, Zaccaro, Bibi Ferreira, Maria della Costa, Ruth Escobar, Opera, TBC, Imprensa, Oficina, Àgora, Cacilda Becker, Sérgio Cardoso, do Bixiga, and Bandeirantes.

The hostel hosted approximately 3,000 people on average, but occasionally reached 8,000. The hostel received the last immigrants in 1978. In 1998 the hostel became a museum, where it preserves the immigrants&#x27; documentation, memory and objects. Located in one of the few remaining centenarian buildings, the museum occupies part of the former hostel. The museum also restores wooden train wagons from the former São Paulo Railway. Two restored wagons inhabit the museum. One dates from 1914, while a second class passenger car dates from 1931.

<doc id="390881" wikidata="Q1047264" url="?curid=390881" title="Wampanoag">
<text>The Wampanoag, also rendered Wôpanâak, are a Native American people of the Northeastern Woodlands currently based in southeastern Massachusetts and formerly parts of eastern Rhode Island. Their historical territory includes the islands of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket.

Today, two Wampanoag tribes are federally recognized:
* Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe
* Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah).

The Wampanoag language, also known as Massachusett, is a Southern New England Algonquian language.

Prior to English contact in the 17th century, the Wampanoag numbered as many as 40,000 people living across 67 villages composing the Wampanoag Nation. These villages covered the territory along the east coast as far as Wessagusset (today called Weymouth), all of what is now Cape Cod and the islands of Natocket and Noepe (now called Nantucket and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard), and southeast as far as Pokanocket (now Bristol and Warren, Rhode Island). The Wampanoag lived on this land for over 12,000 years.

From 1615 to 1619, a leptospirosis epidemic carried by rodents arriving in European ships dramatically reduced the population of the Wampanoag and neighboring tribes. Indigenous deaths from the epidemic facilitated the European invasion and colonization of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. More than 50 years later, Wampanoag Chief Sachem Metacom and his allies waged King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1676) against the colonists. The war resulted in the death of 40 percent of the surviving Wampanoag. The English sold many Wampanoag men into slavery in Bermuda, the West Indies, or on plantations and farms run by colonists in New England.

Today, Wampanoag people continue to live in historical homelands and maintain central aspects of their culture while adapting to changing socioeconomic needs. Oral traditions, ceremonies, song and dance, social gatherings, and hunting and fishing remain important traditional ways of life to the Wampanoag. In 2015, the federal government declared 150 acres of land in Mashpee and 170 acres of land in Taunton as the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe’s initial reservation, on which the Tribe can exercise its full tribal sovereignty rights. The Mashpee tribe currently has approximately 3,200 enrolled citizens. The Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head currently has 901 enrolled citizens. Early 21st-century population estimates indicated a total of 4,500 Wampanoag descendants.

Wampanoag activists have been reviving the Wampanoag language; Mashpee High School began a course in 2018 teaching the language.

==Name==
&quot;Wampanoag&quot; probably derives from &quot;Wapanoos&quot;, first documented on Adriaen Block&#x27;s 1614 map, which was the earliest European representation of the Wampanoag territory. The Wampanoag translate this word to &quot;People of the First Light.&quot; Increase Mather first recorded it in 1676 to describe the alliance of tribes who fought against the English in King Philip&#x27;s War.

In 1616, John Smith referred to one of the Wampanoag tribes as the Pokanoket. The earliest colonial records and reports used &quot;Pokanoket&quot; as the name of the tribe whose leaders (the Massasoit Ousemequin until 1661, his son Wamsutta from 1661 to 1662, and Metacomet from 1662 to 1676) led the Wampanoag confederation at the time the English began settling southeastern New England. The Pokanoket were based at Sowams, near where Warren, Rhode Island, developed and on the peninsula where Bristol, Rhode Island, arose after King Philip&#x27;s War. The Seat of Metacomet, or King Philip&#x27;s seat, at Mount Hope Bay in Bristol, Rhode Island became the political center from which Metacomet began King Philip&#x27;s War, the first intertribal war of Native American resistance to English settlement in North America.

==Wampanoag groups and locations==

==Culture==
The Wampanoag people were semi-sedentary (that is, partially nomadic), with seasonal movements between sites in southern New England. The men often traveled far north and south along the Eastern seaboard for seasonal fishing expeditions, and sometimes stayed in those distant locations for weeks and months at a time. The women cultivated varieties of the &quot;three sisters&quot; (maize, climbing beans, and squash) as the staples of their diet, supplemented by fish and game caught by the men. Each community had authority over a well-defined territory from which the people derived their livelihood through a seasonal round of fishing, planting, harvesting, and hunting. Southern New England was populated by various tribes, so hunting grounds had strictly defined boundaries.

The Wampanoag had a matrilineal system, like other indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands, in which women owned property, and hereditary status was passed through the maternal line. They were also matrifocal; when a young couple married, they lived with the woman&#x27;s family. Women elders could approve selection of chiefs or sachems. Men acted in most of the political roles for relations with other bands and tribes, as well as warfare. Women passed plots of land to their female descendants, regardless of their marital status.

The production of food among the Wampanoag was similar to that of many American Indian societies, and food habits were divided along gender lines. Men and women had specific tasks. Women played an active role in many of the stages of food production and processing, so they had important socio-political, economic, and spiritual roles in their communities. Wampanoag men were mainly responsible for hunting and fishing, while women took care of farming and gathering wild fruits, nuts, berries, and shellfish. Women were responsible for up to 75 percent of all food production in Wampanoag societies.

The Wampanoag were organized into a confederation in which a head sachem presided over a number of other sachems. The colonists often referred to him as &quot;king&quot;, but the position of a sachem differed in many ways from a king. They were selected by women elders and were bound to consult their own councilors within their tribe, as well as any of the &quot;petty sachems&quot; in the region. They were also responsible for arranging trade privileges, as well as protecting their allies in exchange for material tribute. Both women and men could hold the position of sachem, and women were sometimes chosen over close male relatives.

Pre-marital sexual experimentation was accepted, although the Wampanoag expected fidelity within unions after marriage. Roger Williams (1603–1683) said that &quot;single fornication they count no sin, but after Marriage... they count it heinous for either of them to be false.&quot; Polygamy was practiced among the Wampanoag, although monogamy was the norm. Some elite men could take several wives for political or social reasons, and multiple wives were a symbol of wealth. Women were the producers and distributors of corn and other food products. Marriage and conjugal unions were not as important as ties of clan and kinship.

==Language and revival==

The Wampanoag originally spoke Wôpanâak, a dialect of the Massachusett language, which belongs to the Algonquian languages family. The first Bible published in America was a 1663 translation into Wampanoag by missionary John Eliot. He created an orthography, which he taught to the Wampanoag. Many became literate, using Wampanoag for letters, deeds, and historic documents.

The rapid decline of Wampanoag speakers began after the American Revolution. Neal Salisbury and Colin G. Calloway suggest that New England Indian communities suffered from gender imbalances at this time due to premature male deaths, especially due to warfare and their work in the hazardous trades of whaling and shipping. They posit that many Wampanoag women married outside their linguistic groups, making it difficult for them to maintain the various Wampanoag dialects.

Jessie Little Doe Baird, a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, founded the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project in 1993. They have taught some children, who have become the first speakers of Wôpanâak in more than a century. The project is training teachers to reach more children and to develop a curriculum for a &quot;Wôpanâak&quot;-based school. Baird has developed a 10,000-word Wôpanâak-English dictionary by consulting archival Wôpanâak documents and using linguistic methods to reconstruct unattested words. For this project she was awarded a $500,000.00 grant from the Macarthur Fellows in 2010. She has also produced a grammar, collections of stories, and other books. Mashpee High School began a course in 2018 teaching the language.

== History ==
Contacts between the Wampanoag and colonists began in the 16th century when European merchant vessels and fishing boats traveled along the coast of New England. In 1524, Giovanni de Verrazano contacted various tribes such as the Wampanoag and the Narragansett in modern day Rhode Island. Captain Thomas Hunt captured several Wampanoag in 1614 and sold them in Spain as slaves. A Patuxet named Tisquantum (or Squanto) was kidnapped by Spanish monks who attempted to convert him before setting him free. He accompanied an expedition to Newfoundland as an interpreter, then made his way back to his homeland in 1619, only to 
discover that the entire Patuxet tribe had died in an epidemic.

In 1620, the Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth, and Tisquantum and other Wampanoag taught them how to cultivate the varieties of corn, squash, and beans (the Three Sisters) that flourished in New England, as well as how to catch and process fish and collect seafood. They enabled the Pilgrims to survive their first winters, and Squanto lived with them and acted as a middleman between them and &quot;Massasoit&quot;, the Wampanoag sachem. In &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation,&quot; initial contact between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag was recorded as beginning in the Spring of 1621.

The Wampanoag suffered from an epidemic between 1616 and 1619, long thought to be smallpox introduced by contact with Europeans. However, a 2010 study suggests that the epidemic was leptospirosis, introduced by rat reservoirs on European ships. The groups most devastated by the illness were those who had traded heavily with the French and the disease was likely a virgin soil epidemic. Alfred Crosby has estimated population losses to be as high as 90 percent among the Massachusett and mainland Pokanoket.

Since the late 20th century, the event celebrated as the first Thanksgiving has been debated in the United States. Many American Indians and historians argue against the romanticized story of the Wampanoag celebrating together with the colonists. Some say that there is no documentation of such an event. One primary account of the 1621 event was written by a firsthand observer.

Massasoit became gravely ill in the winter of 1623, but he was nursed back to health by the colonists. In 1632, the Narragansetts attacked Massasoit&#x27;s village in Sowam, but the colonists helped the Wampanoag to drive them back.
After 1632, the Plymouth Colony was outnumbered by the growing Puritans settlements around Boston. The colonists expanded westward into the Connecticut River Valley. In 1638, they destroyed the powerful Pequot Confederation. In 1643, the Mohegans defeated the Narragansetts in a war with support from the colonists, and they became the dominant tribe in southern New England.

=== Conversion to Christianity ===
After 1650, John Eliot and other Puritan missionaries sought to convert local tribes to Christianity, and those that converted settled in 14 Praying towns. Eliot and his colleagues hoped that the Indians would adopt practices such as monogamous marriage, agriculture, and jurisprudence. The high levels of epidemics among the Indians may have motivated some conversions. Salisbury suggests that the survivors suffered a type of spiritual crisis because their medical and religious leaders had been unable to prevent the epidemic losses. 
Individual towns and regions had differing expectations for Indian conversions. In most of Eliot&#x27;s mainland praying towns, religious converts were also expected to follow colonial laws and manners and to adopt the material trappings of colonial life. Eliot and other ministers relied on praise and rewards for those who conformed, rather than punishing those who did not. The Christian Indian settlements of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard were noted for a great deal of sharing and mixing between Wampanoag and colonial ways of life. Wampanoag converts often continued their traditional practices in dress, hairstyle, and governance. The Martha&#x27;s Vineyard converts were not required to attend church and they often maintained traditional cultural practices, such as mourning rituals.

The Wampanoag women were more likely to convert to Christianity than the men. Experience Mayhew said that &quot;it seems to be a Truth with respect to our Indians, so far as my knowledge of them extend, that there have been, and are a greater number of their Women appearing pious than of the men among them&quot; in his text &quot;Indian Converts&quot;. The frequency of female conversion created a problem for missionaries, who wanted to establish patriarchal family and societal structures among them. Women had control of property, and inheritance and descent passed through their line, including hereditary leadership for men. Wampanoag women on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard were the spiritual leaders of their households. In general, English ministers agreed that it was preferable for women to subvert the patriarchal model and assume a dominant spiritual role than it was for their husbands to remain unconverted. Experience Mayhew asked, &quot;How can those Wives answer it unto God who do not Use their utmost Endeavors to Perswade and oblige their husbands to maintain Prayer in their families?&quot; In some cases, Wampanoag women converts accepted changed gender roles under colonial custom, while others practiced their traditional roles of shared power as Christians.

=== Metacomet (King Philip) ===
Massasoit was among those Indians who adopted colonial customs. He asked the legislators in Plymouth near the end of his life to give both of his sons English names. The older son Wamsutta was given the name Alexander, and his younger brother Metacom was named Philip. After his father&#x27;s death, Alexander became the sachem of the Wampanoag. The colonists invited him to Plymouth to talk, but Wamsutta became seriously ill on the way home and died shortly after. The Wampanoag were told that he died of fever, but many Indians thought that he had been poisoned. The following year, his brother Philip (Metacom) became sachem of the Wampanoag.

Under Philip&#x27;s leadership, the relationship changed dramatically between the Wampanoag and the colonists. Philip believed that the ever-increasing colonists would eventually take over everything — not only land, but also their culture, their way of life, and their religion — so he decided to limit the further expansion of colonial settlements. The Wampanoag numbered only 1,000, and Philip began to visit other tribes to build alliances among those who also wanted to push out the colonists. At that time, the population colonists in southern New England was already more than double that of the Indians, at 35,000 to 15,000. In 1671, Philip was called to Taunton, Massachusetts, where he listened to the accusations of the colonists and signed an agreement that required the Wampanoag to give up their firearms. To be on the safe side, he did not take part in the subsequent dinner. His men never delivered their weapons.

Philip gradually gained the Nipmuck, Pocomtuc, and Narragansett as allies, and the beginning of the uprising was first planned for the spring of 1676. In March 1675, however, John Sassamon was murdered. Sassamon was a Christian Indian raised in Natick, one of the praying towns. He was educated at Harvard College and had served as a scribe, interpreter, and counselor to Philip and the Wampanoag. But, a week before his death, Sassamon reported to Plymouth governor Josiah Winslow that Philip was planning a war against the colonists.

Sassamon was found dead under the ice of Assawompsett Pond a week later. A Christian Indian accused three Wampanoag warriors of his murder. The colonists took the three captive and hanged them in June 1675 after a trial by a jury of 12 colonists and six Christian Indians. This execution, combined with rumors that the colonists wanted to capture Philip, was a catalyst for war. Philip called a council of war on Mount Hope. Most Wampanoag wanted to follow him, except the Nauset on Cape Cod and the small groups on the offshore islands. Allies included the Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, some Pennacook, and eastern Abenaki from farther north. The Narragansett remained neutral at the beginning of the war.

=== King Philip&#x27;s War ===

On June 20, 1675, some Wampanoag attacked colonists in Swansea, Massachusetts, and laid siege to the town. Five days later, they destroyed it completely, leading to King Philip&#x27;s War. The united tribes in southern New England attacked 52 of 90 colonial settlements and partially burned them down.

At the outbreak of the war, many Indians offered to fight with the colonists against King Philip and his allies, serving as warriors, scouts, advisers, and spies. Mistrust and hostility eventually caused the colonists to discontinue Indian assistance, even though they were invaluable in the war. The Massachusetts government moved many Christian Indians to Deer Island in Boston Harbor, in part to protect the &quot;
praying Indians&quot; from vigilantes, but also as a precautionary measure to prevent rebellion and sedition from them. Mary Rowlandson&#x27;s &quot;The Sovereignty and Goodness of God&quot; is an account of her months of captivity by the Wampanoag during King Philip&#x27;s War in which she expressed shock at the cruelties from Christian Indians.

From Massachusetts, the war spread to other parts of New England. The Kennebec, Pigwacket (Pequawkets), and Arosaguntacook from Maine joined in the war against the colonists. The Narragansetts of Rhode Island gave up their neutrality after the colonists attacked one of their fortified villages. The Narragansetts lost more than 600 people and 20 sachems in the battle which became known as the &quot;Great Swamp Massacre&quot;. Their leader Canonchet was able to flee and led a large group of Narragansett warriors west to join King Philip&#x27;s warriors.

The war turned against Philip in the spring of 1676, following a winter of hunger and deprivation. The colonial troops set out after Canonchet and took him captive. After a firing squad executed him, colonists quartered his corpse and sent his head to Hartford, Connecticut, where it was set on public display.

During the summer months, Philip escaped from his pursuers and went to a hideout on Mount Hope in Rhode Island. Colonial forces attacked in August, killing and capturing 173 Wampanoags. Philip barely escaped capture, but his wife and their nine-year-old son were captured and put on a ship at Plymouth. They were then sold as slaves in the West Indies. On August 12, 1676, colonial troops surrounded Philip&#x27;s camp, and soon shot and killed him.

=== Consequences of the war ===
With the death of Metacomet and most of their leaders, the Wampanoags were nearly exterminated; only about 400 survived the war. The Narragansetts and Nipmucks suffered similar rates of losses, and many small tribes in southern New England were finished. In addition, many Wampanoag were sold into slavery. Male captives were generally sold to slave traders and transported to the West Indies, Bermuda, Virginia, or the Iberian Peninsula. The colonists used the women and children as slaves or indentured servants in New England, depending on the colony. Massachusetts resettled the remaining Wampanoags in Natick, Wamesit, Punkapoag, and Hassanamesit, four of the original 14 praying towns. These were the only ones to be resettled after the war. Overall, approximately 5,000 Indians (40 percent of their population) and 2,500 colonists (5 percent) were killed in King Philip&#x27;s War.

===18th to 20th century===

==== Mashpee ====
The exception to relocation was the coastal islands&#x27; Wampanoag groups, who had stayed neutral through the war. The colonists forced the Wampanoag of the mainland to resettle with the Saconnet (Sekonnet), or with the Nauset into the praying towns in Barnstable County. Mashpee is the largest Indian reservation set aside in Massachusetts, and is located on Cape Cod. In 1660, the colonists allotted the natives about there, and beginning in 1665 they had self-government, adopting an English-style court of law and trials. Mashpee sachems Wepquish and Tookenchosin declared in 1665 that this land would not be able to be sold to non-Mashpee without the unanimous consent of the tribe, writing &quot;We freely give these lands forementioned unto the South Sea Indians and their children forever: and not to be sold or given away from them by anyone without all their consents thereunto.&quot; An Indian Deed relating to the Petition of Reuben Cognehew presented a provision established by a representative of the community named Quatchatisset establishing that the allotment would &quot; for ever not to be sold or given or alienated from them [his descendants] or any part of these lands.&quot; Property deeds in 1671 recorded this area known as the Mashpee Plantation as consisting of around 55 square miles of land. The area was integrated into the district of Mashpee in 1763.

In 1788 after the American Revolutionary War, the state revoked the Wampanoag ability to self-govern, considering it a failure. It appointed a supervisory committee consisting of five European-American members, with no Wampanoag. In 1834, the state returned a certain degree of self-government to the First Nations People, and although the First Nations People were far from autonomous, they continued in this manner. To support assimilation, in 1842 the state violated the Nonintercourse Act when it illegally allocated plots from of their communal , to be distributed in parcels to each household for subsistence farming, although New England communities were adopting other types of economies. The state passed laws to try to control white encroachment on the reservation; some stole wood from its forests. A large region, once rich in wood, fish, and game, it was considered highly desirable by the whites. With competition between whites and the Wampanoag, conflicts were more frequent than for more isolated native settlements elsewhere in the state. In 1870, each member of the Mashpee tribe over the age of 18 was granted 60 acres of land for private ownership, effectively dismantling the thousands of acres of common tribal lands, and by 1871, non-Mashpee land ownership of the choicest portions of land purchased from impoverished Mashpee, leading to significant loss of Mashpee land ownership.

==== Wampanoag on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard ====
On Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in the 18th and 19th centuries, there were three reservations—Chappaquiddick, Christiantown and Gay Head. The Chappaquiddick Reservation was part of a small island of the same name and was located on the eastern point of that island. As the result of the sale of land in 1789, the natives lost valuable areas, and the remaining land was distributed among the Indian residents in 1810. In 1823 the laws were changed, in order to hinder those trying to get rid of the natives and to implement a visible beginning of a civic organization. Around 1849, they owned of infertile land, and many of the residents moved to nearby Edgartown, so that they could practice a trade and obtain some civil rights.

Christiantown was originally a praying town on the northwest side of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, northwest of Tisbury. In 1849 the reservation still consisted of , of which all but 10 were distributed among the residents. The land, kept under community ownership, yielded very few crops and the tribe members left it to get paying jobs in the cities. Wampanoag oral history tells that Christiantown was wiped out in 1888 by a smallpox epidemic.

The third reservation on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard was constructed in 1711 by the New England Company (founded in 1649) to Christianize the natives. They bought land for the Gay Head natives who had lived there since before 1642. There was considerable dispute about how the land should be cultivated, as the colony had leased the better sections to the whites at low interest. The original goal of creating an undisturbed center for missionary work was quickly forgotten. The state finally created a reservation on a peninsula on the western point of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and named it Gay Head. This region was connected to the main island by an isthmus; it enabled the isolation desired by the Wampanoag. In 1849 they had there, of which 500 acres were distributed among the tribe members. The rest was communal property. In contrast to the other reservation groups, the tribe had no guardian or headman. When they needed advice on legal questions, they asked the guardian of the Chappaquiddick Reservation, but other matters they handled themselves. The band used usufruct title, meaning that members had no legal claim to their land and allowed the tribal members free rein over their choice of land, as well as over cultivation and building, in order to make their ownership clear. They did not allow whites to settle on their land. They made strict laws regulating membership in the tribe. As a result, they were able to strengthen the groups&#x27; ties to each other, and they did not lose their tribal identity until long after other groups had lost theirs.

The Wampanoag on Nantucket Island were almost completely destroyed by an unknown plague in 1763; the last Nantucket Wampanoag died in 1855.

== Sachems of the Wampanoag ==

==Current status==

Today, there are two federally recognized Wampanoag tribes and one state-recognized Wampanoag tribe. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe has about 3,200 enrolled citizens in 2023. The Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) had 1,364 enrolled tribal citizens in 2019. The state-recognized Herring Pond Tribe has not posted their citizen records.

Some genealogy experts testified that some of the tribes did not demonstrate the required continuity since historic times. For instance, in his testimony to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the historian Francis Hutchins said that the Mashpee &quot;were not an Indian tribe in the years 1666, 1680, 1763, 1790, 1834, 1870, and 1970, or at any time between 1666 and 1970.&quot; In his opinion, an Indian tribe was &quot;an entity composed of persons of American Indian descent, which entity possesses distinct political, legal, cultural attributes, which attributes have descended directly from aboriginal precursors.&quot; Without accounting for cultural change, adaptation, and the effects of non-Indian society, Hutchins argued the Mashpee were not an Indian tribe historically because they adopted Christianity and non-Indian forms of dress and appearance, and chose to remain in Massachusetts as &quot;second-class&quot; citizens rather than emigrating westward (note: to Indian Territory) to &quot;resume tribal existence.&quot; Hutchins also noted that they intermarried with non-Indians to create a &quot;non-white&quot; or &quot;colored&quot; community. Hutchins appeared to require unchanged culture, including maintenance of a traditional religion and essentially total social autonomy from non-Indian society.&quot;

A project titled &quot;Massachusetts Native Peoples and the Social Contract: A Reassessment for Our Times&quot; began in 2015 to serve as an updated report on the cultural, linguistic, and economic state of Wampanoag peoples, including those from federally and non-federally recognized tribes.

=== Federally recognized Wampanoag tribes ===
==== Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe ====
The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe consists of more than 1,400 enrolled members who must meet defined membership requirements including lineage, community involvement and reside within 20 miles of Mashpee. Since 1924 they have held an annual powwow at the beginning of July in Mashpee. This first powwow was held at the New Light Baptist Church, at the time called Pondville Church, in Pondville, Massachusetts. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council was established in 1972 under the leadership of its first president, Russell &quot;Fast Turtle&quot; Peters. In 1974 the Council petitioned the Bureau of Indian Affairs for recognition. In 1976 the tribe sued the Town of Mashpee for the return of ancestral homelands. The case was lost but the tribe continued to pursue federal recognition for three decades.

In 2000 the Mashpee Wampanoag council was headed by chairman Glenn Marshall. Marshall led the group until 2007 when it was disclosed that he had a prior conviction for rape, had lied about having a military record and was under investigation associated for improprieties associated with the tribe&#x27;s casino lobbying efforts. Marshall was succeeded by tribal council vice- chair Shawn Hendricks. He held the position until Marshall pleaded guilty in 2009 to federal charges of embezzling, wire fraud, mail fraud, tax evasion and election finance law violations. He steered tens of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions to politicians through the tribe&#x27;s hired lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who was convicted of numerous charges in a much larger scheme. Following the arrests of Abramoff and Marshall, the newly recognized Mashpee Tribe led by new chair Shawn Hendricks, continued to work with Abramoff lobbyist colleague Kevin A. Ring pursuing their Indian gaming-related interests. Ring was subsequently convicted on corruption charges linked to his work for the Mashpee band. Tribal elders who had sought access to the tribal council records detailing the council&#x27;s involvement in this scandal via a complaint filed in Barnstable Municipal Court were shunned by the council and banned them from the tribe for seven years.

In 2009 the tribe elected council member Cedric Cromwell to the position of council chair and president. Cromwell ran a campaign based on reforms and distancing himself from the previous chairmen, even though he had served as a councilor for the prior six years during which the Marshall and Abramoff scandals took place – including voting for the shunning of tribe members who tried to investigate. A challenge to Cromwell&#x27;s election by defeated candidates following allegations of tampering with voting and enrollment records was filed with the Tribal Court, and Cromwell&#x27;s administration has been hampered by a series of protest by Elders over casino-related finances.

The Mashpee Wampanoag tribal offices are located in Mashpee on Cape Cod. After decades of legal disputes, the Mashpee Wampanoag obtained provisional recognition as an Indian tribe from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in April 2006, and official Federal recognition in February 2007. Tribal members own some land, as well as land held in common by Wampanoag descendants at both Chapaquddick and Christiantown. Descendants have also purchased land in Middleborough, Massachusetts, upon which the tribe under Glenn A. Marshall&#x27;s leadership had lobbied to build a casino. The tribe has moved its plans to Taunton, Massachusetts, but their territorial rights have been challenged by the Pocasset Wampanoag Tribe of the Pokanoket Nation, an organization not recognized as a tribe.

But Indian gaming operations are regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. It contains a general prohibition against gaming on lands acquired into trust after October 17, 1988. The tribe&#x27;s attempts to gain approvals have been met with legal and government approval challenges.

The Wampanoag Tribe&#x27;s plan as of 2011 had agreement for financing by the Malaysian Genting Group and has the political support of Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, and former Massachusetts Congressman Bill Delahunt, who is working as a lobbyist to represent the casino project. Both Kerry and Delahunt received campaign contributions from the Wampanoag Tribe in transactions authorized by Glenn Marshall as part of the Abramoff lobbying scandal.

In November 2011, the Massachusetts legislature passed a law to license up to three sites for gaming resort casinos and one for a slot machine parlor. The Wampanoag are given a &quot;headstart&quot; to develop plans for a casino in southeastern part of the state.

A December 2021 ruling from the United States Department of the Interior gives the Mashpee Wampanoag &quot;substantial control&quot; over 320 acres on Cape Cod. The Obama administration had put the land in federal trust, but the Trump administration reversed that decision. A federal judge blocked that action and the federal government appealed, but the Biden administration dropped the appeal.

==== Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) ====
The Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) are headquartered in Aquinnah, Massachusetts. &quot;Aquinnah&quot; translates as &quot;land under the hill&quot;. They are the only Wampanoag tribe to have a formal land-in-trust reservation, which is located on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Their reservation consists of and is located on the outermost southwest part of the island. In 1972, Aquinnah Wampanoag descendants formed the Wampanoag Tribal Council of Gay Head, Inc., to achieve self-determination and federal recognition. The Bureau of Indian Affairs recognized the tribe in 1987. The tribe has 1,121 enrolled citizens.

Gladys Widdiss, an Aquinnah Wampanoag tribal historian and potter, served as the President of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head from 1978 to 1987. The Aquinnah Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head won federal recognition from the United States government during her tenure. Under Widdis, the Aquinnah Wampanoag also acquired the Herring Creek, the Gay Head Cliffs, and the cranberry bogs surrounding Gay Head (now called Aquinnah) during her presidency.

The Aquinnah Wampanoag are led by tribal council chair Cheryl Andrews-Maltais, who was elected to the post in November 2007. In 2010, Andrews-Maltais put forward plans for the development of an Aquinnah reservation casino, which was met with opposition by state and local officials.

=== State-recognized tribe ===
The Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe is a state-recognized tribe based in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey granted them state-recognition on November 19, 2024 through Executive Order 637.

== Cultural heritage groups ==

Numerous organizations that self-identify as Native American tribes identify as Wampanoag. The Massachusetts&#x27; Commission on Indian Affairs works with some of these organizations.

Some groups have submitted letters of intent to petition for federal acknowledgment, but none have actively petitioned for federal acknowledgment. Unrecognized groups who identify as being of Wampanoag descent include:
# Assawompsett-Nemasket Band of Wampanoags
# Assonet Band of Wampanoags
# Chappaquiddick Wampanoag Tribe, South Yarmouth, MA (Letter of Intent to Petition 05/21/2007)
# Massachuset-Ponkapoag Tribal Council, Holliston, MA
# Nova Scotia Wampanoag Council, Clark&#x27;s Harbour, NS
# Pocasset Wampanoag Indian Tribe, Great Falls, MA. (Letter of Intent to Petition 1/23/1995)
# Seaconke Wampanoag Tribe, Warwick, RI (Letter of Intent to Petition 10/29/1998)

<text>An electric locomotive is a locomotive powered by electricity from overhead lines, a third rail or on-board energy storage such as a battery or a supercapacitor. Locomotives with on-board fuelled prime movers, such as diesel engines or gas turbines, are classed as diesel–electric or gas turbine–electric and not as electric locomotives, because the electric generator/motor combination serves only as a power transmission system.

Electric locomotives benefit from the high efficiency of electric motors, often above 90% (not including the inefficiency of generating the electricity). Additional efficiency can be gained from regenerative braking, which allows kinetic energy to be recovered during braking to put power back on the line. Newer electric locomotives use AC motor-inverter drive systems that provide for regenerative braking. Electric locomotives are quiet compared to diesel locomotives since there is no engine and exhaust noise and less mechanical noise. The lack of reciprocating parts means electric locomotives are easier on the track, reducing track maintenance. Power plant capacity is far greater than any individual locomotive uses, so electric locomotives can have a higher power output than diesel locomotives and they can produce even higher short-term surge power for fast acceleration. Electric locomotives are ideal for commuter rail service with frequent stops. Electric locomotives are used on freight routes with consistently high traffic volumes, or in areas with advanced rail networks. Power plants, even if they burn fossil fuels, are far cleaner than mobile sources such as locomotive engines. The power can also come from low-carbon or renewable sources, including geothermal power, hydroelectric power, biomass, solar power, nuclear power and wind turbines. Electric locomotives usually cost 20% less than diesel locomotives, their maintenance costs are 25–35% lower, and cost up to 50% less to run.

The chief disadvantage of electrification is the high cost for infrastructure: overhead lines or third rail, substations, and control systems. The impact of this varies depending on local laws and regulations. For example, public policy in the U.S. interferes with electrification: higher property taxes are imposed on privately owned rail facilities if they are electrified. The EPA regulates exhaust emissions on locomotive and marine engines, similar to regulations on car &amp; freight truck emissions, in order to limit the amount of carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitric oxides, and soot output from these mobile power sources. Because railroad infrastructure is privately owned in the U.S., railroads are unwilling to make the necessary investments for electrification. In Europe and elsewhere, railway networks are considered part of the national transport infrastructure, just like roads, highways and waterways, so are often financed by the state. Operators of the rolling stock pay fees according to rail use. This makes possible the large investments required for the technically and, in the long-term, also economically advantageous electrification.

==History==

===Direct current===

The first known electric locomotive was built in 1837 by chemist Robert Davidson of Aberdeen, and it was powered by galvanic cells (batteries). Davidson later built a larger locomotive named &quot;Galvani&quot;, exhibited at the Royal Scottish Society of Arts Exhibition in 1841. The seven-ton vehicle had two direct-drive reluctance motors, with fixed electromagnets acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle, and simple commutators. It hauled a load of six tons at four miles per hour (6 kilometers per hour) for a distance of . It was tested on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in September of the following year, but the limited power from batteries prevented its general use. It was destroyed by railway workers, who saw it as a threat to their job security.

The first electric passenger train and first electric locomotive powered by a generator was presented by Werner von Siemens at Berlin in 1879. The locomotive was driven by a 2.2 kW, series-wound motor, and the train, consisting of the locomotive and three cars, reached a speed of 13 km/h. During four months, the train carried 90,000 passengers on a circular track. The electricity (150 V DC) was supplied through a third insulated rail between the tracks. A contact roller was used to collect the electricity.

The world&#x27;s first electric tram line opened in Lichterfelde near Berlin, Germany, in 1881. It was built by Werner von Siemens (see Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway and Berlin Straßenbahn). Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway opened in 1883 in Brighton. Also in 1883, Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram opened near Vienna in Austria. It was the first in the world in regular service powered from an overhead line. Five years later, in the U.S. electric trolleys were pioneered in 1888 on the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, using equipment designed by Frank J. Sprague.

The first electrified Hungarian railway lines were opened in 1887. Budapest (See: BHÉV): Ráckeve line (1887), Szentendre line (1888), Gödöllő line (1888), Csepel line (1912).

Much of the early development of electric locomotion was driven by the increasing use of tunnels, particularly in urban areas. Smoke from steam locomotives was noxious and municipalities were increasingly inclined to prohibit their use within their limits. The first electrically worked underground line was the City and South London Railway, prompted by a clause in its enabling act prohibiting the use of steam power. It opened in 1890, using electric locomotives built by Mather and Platt. Electricity quickly became the power supply of choice for subways, abetted by Sprague&#x27;s invention of multiple-unit train control in 1897. Surface and elevated rapid transit systems generally used steam until forced to convert by ordinance.

The first use of electrification on an American main line was on a four-mile stretch of the Baltimore Belt Line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) in 1895 connecting the main portion of the B&amp;O to the new line to New York through a series of tunnels around the edges of Baltimore&#x27;s downtown. Parallel tracks on the Pennsylvania Railroad had shown that coal smoke from steam locomotives would be a major operating issue and a public nuisance. Three Bo+Bo units were initially used, the EL-1 Model. At the south end of the electrified section; they coupled onto the locomotive and train and pulled it through the tunnels. Railroad entrances to New York City required similar tunnels and the smoke problems were more acute there. A collision in the Park Avenue tunnel in 1902 led the New York State legislature to outlaw the use of smoke-generating locomotives south of the Harlem River after 1 July 1908. In response, electric locomotives began operation in 1904 on the New York Central Railroad. In the 1930s, the Pennsylvania Railroad, which had introduced electric locomotives because of the NYC regulation, electrified its entire territory east of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad (the Milwaukee Road), the last transcontinental line to be built, electrified its lines across the Rocky Mountains and to the Pacific Ocean starting in 1915. A few East Coastlines, notably the Virginian Railway and the Norfolk and Western Railway, electrified short sections of their mountain crossings. However, by this point electrification in the United States was more associated with dense urban traffic and the use of electric locomotives declined in the face of dieselization. Diesel shared some of the electric locomotive&#x27;s advantages over steam and the cost of building and maintaining the power supply infrastructure, which discouraged new installations, brought on the elimination of most main-line electrification outside the Northeast. Except for a few captive systems (e.g. the Deseret Power Railroad), by 2000 electrification was confined to the Northeast Corridor and some commuter service; even there, freight service was handled by diesel. Development continued in Europe, where electrification was widespread. 1,500 V DC is still used on some lines near France and 25 kV 50 Hz is used by high-speed trains.

===Alternating current===
The first practical AC electric locomotive was designed by Charles Brown, then working for Oerlikon, Zürich. In 1891, Brown had demonstrated long-distance power transmission for the International Electrotechnical Exhibition, using three-phase AC, between a hydro–electric plant at Lauffen am Neckar and the expo site at Frankfurt am Main West, a distance of 280 km. Using experience he had gained while working for Jean Heilmann on steam–electric locomotive designs, Brown observed that three-phase motors had a higher power-to-weight ratio than DC motors and, because of the absence of a commutator, were simpler to manufacture and maintain. However, they were much larger than the DC motors of the time and could not be mounted in underfloor bogies: they could only be carried within locomotive bodies. In 1896, Oerlikon installed the first commercial example of the system on the Lugano Tramway. Each 30-tonne locomotive had two motors run by three-phase 750 V 40 Hz fed from double overhead lines. Three-phase motors run at a constant speed and provide regenerative braking and are thus well suited to steeply graded routes; in 1899 Brown (by then in partnership with Walter Boveri) supplied the first main-line three-phase locomotives to the 40 km Burgdorf–Thun railway (highest point 770 metres), Switzerland. The first implementation of industrial frequency single-phase AC supply for locomotives came from Oerlikon in 1901, using the designs of Hans Behn-Eschenburg and Emil Huber-Stockar; installation on the Seebach-Wettingen line of the Swiss Federal Railways was completed in 1904. The 15 kV, 50 Hz , 48 tonne locomotives used transformers and rotary converters to power DC traction motors.

In 1894, Hungarian engineer Kálmán Kandó developed a new type 3-phase asynchronous electric drive motors and generators for electric locomotives at the Fives-Lille Company. Kandó&#x27;s early 1894 designs were first applied in a short three-phase AC tramway in Évian-les-Bains (France), which was constructed between 1896 and 1898.
In 1918, Kandó invented and developed the rotary phase converter, enabling electric locomotives to use three-phase motors whilst supplied via a single overhead wire, carrying the simple industrial frequency (50 Hz) single phase AC of the high voltage national networks.
Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a mainline rather than just a short stretch. The 106 km Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz Works. The electrical system was three-phase at 3 kV 15 Hz. The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices. The three-phase two-wire system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as &quot;the Italian system&quot;. Kandó was invited in 1905 to undertake the management of Società Italiana Westinghouse and led the development of several Italian electric locomotives. During the period of electrification of the Italian railways, tests were made as to which type of power to use: in some sections there was a 3,600 V  Hz three-phase power supply, in others there was 1,500 V DC, 3 kV DC and 10 kV AC 45 Hz supply. After WW2, 3 kV DC power was chosen for the entire Italian railway system.

A later development of Kandó, working with both the Ganz works and Societa Italiana Westinghouse, was an electro-mechanical converter, allowing the use of three-phase motors from single-phase AC, eliminating the need for two overhead wires. In 1923, the first phase-converter locomotive in Hungary was constructed on the basis of Kandó&#x27;s designs and serial production began soon after. The first installation, at 16 kV 50 Hz, was in 1932 on the 56 km section of the Hungarian State Railways between Budapest and Komárom. This proved successful and the electrification was extended to Hegyeshalom in 1934.
In Europe, electrification projects initially focused on mountainous regions for several reasons: coal supplies were difficult, hydroelectric power was readily available, and electric locomotives gave more traction on steeper lines. This was particularly applicable in Switzerland, where almost all lines are electrified. An important contribution to the wider adoption of AC traction came from SNCF of France after World War II. The company had assessed the industrial-frequency AC line routed through the steep Höllental Valley, Germany, which was under French administration following the war. After trials, the company decided that the performance of AC locomotives was sufficiently developed to allow all its future installations, regardless of terrain, to be of this standard, with its associated cheaper and more efficient infrastructure. The SNCF decision, ignoring as it did the of high-voltage DC already installed on French routes, was influential in the standard selected for other countries in Europe.
The 1960s saw the electrification of many European main lines. European electric locomotive technology had improved steadily from the 1920s onwards. By comparison, the Milwaukee Road class EP-2 (1918) weighed 240 t, with a power of 3,330 kW and a maximum speed of 112 km/h; in 1935, German E 18 had a power of 2,800 kW, but weighed only 108 tons and had a maximum speed of 150 km/h. On 29 March 1955, French locomotive CC 7107 reached 331 km/h. In 1960 the SJ Class Dm 3 locomotives on Swedish Railways produced a record 7,200 kW. Locomotives capable of commercial passenger service at 200 km/h appeared in Germany and France in the same period. Further improvements resulted from the introduction of electronic control systems, which permitted the use of increasingly lighter and more powerful motors that could be fitted inside the bogies (standardizing from the 1990s onwards on asynchronous three-phase motors, fed through GTO-inverters).

In the 1980s, the development of very high-speed service brought further electrification. The Japanese Shinkansen and the French TGV were the first systems for which devoted high-speed lines were built from scratch. Similar programs were undertaken in Italy, Germany and Spain; in the United States the only new mainline service was an extension of electrification over the Northeast Corridor from New Haven, Connecticut, to Boston, Massachusetts, though new electric light rail systems continued to be built.

On 2 September 2006, a standard production Siemens electric locomotive of the Eurosprinter type ES64-U4 (ÖBB Class 1216) achieved , the record for a locomotive-hauled train, on the new line between Ingolstadt and Nuremberg. This locomotive is now employed largely unmodified by ÖBB to haul their Railjet which is however limited to a top speed of 230 km/h due to economic and infrastructure concerns.

==Types==

An electric locomotive can be supplied with power from
* Rechargeable energy storage systems, such as a battery or ultracapacitor-powered mining locomotives.
* A stationary source, such as a third rail or overhead wire.
* A mixture of both.

The distinguishing design features of electric locomotives are:
* The type of electrical power used, AC or DC.
* The method of storing (batteries, ultracapacitors), collecting (transmission) electrical power, and/or mixed method.
* The means used to couple the traction motors to the driving wheels (drivers).

===Direct and alternating current===
The most fundamental difference lies in the choice of AC or DC. The earliest systems used DC, as AC was not well understood and insulation material for high voltage lines was not available. DC locomotives typically run at relatively low voltage (600 to 3,000 volts); the equipment is therefore relatively massive because the currents involved are large in order to transmit sufficient power. Power must be supplied at frequent intervals as the high currents result in large transmission system losses.

As AC motors were developed, they became the predominant type, particularly on longer routes. High voltages (tens of thousands of volts) are used because this allows the use of low currents; transmission losses are proportional to the square of the current (e.g. twice the current means four times the loss). Thus, high power can be conducted over long distances on lighter and cheaper wires. Transformers in the locomotives transform this power to a low voltage and high current for the motors. A similar high voltage, low current system could not be employed with direct current locomotives because there is no easy way to do the voltage/current transformation for DC so efficiently as achieved by AC transformers.

AC traction still occasionally uses dual overhead wires instead of single-phase lines. The resulting three-phase current drives induction motors, which do not have sensitive commutators and permit easy realisation of a regenerative brake. Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The two-phase lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss rack railways. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe electric brake is an advantage of the system, while speed control and the two-phase lines are problematic.

Rectifier locomotives, which used AC power transmission and DC motors, were common, though DC commutators had problems both in starting and at low velocities. Today&#x27;s advanced electric locomotives use brushless three-phase AC induction motors. These polyphase machines are powered from GTO-, IGCT- or IGBT-based inverters. The cost of electronic devices in a modern locomotive can be up to 50% of the cost of the vehicle.

Electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking, in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of the train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines. This system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations, as descending locomotives can produce a large portion of the power required for ascending trains. Most systems have a characteristic voltage and, in the case of AC power, a system frequency. Many locomotives have been equipped to handle multiple voltages and frequencies as systems came to overlap or were upgraded. American FL9 locomotives were equipped to handle power from two different electrical systems and could also operate as diesel–electrics.

While today&#x27;s systems predominantly operate on AC, many DC systems are still in use – e.g., in South Africa and the United Kingdom (750 V and 1,500 V); Netherlands, Japan, Ireland (1,500 V); Slovenia, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain (3,000 V) and Washington, D.C. (750 V).

===Power transmission===


Electrical circuits require two connections (or for three phase AC, three connections). From the beginning, the track was used for one side of the circuit. Unlike model railroads the track normally supplies only one side, the other of the circuit being provided separately.

====Overhead lines====
Railways generally tend to prefer overhead lines, often called &quot;catenaries&quot; after the support system used to hold the wire parallel to the ground. Three collection methods are possible:

* Trolley pole: a long flexible pole, which engages the line with a wheel or shoe.
* Bow collector: a frame that holds a long collecting rod against the wire.
* Pantograph: a hinged frame that holds the collecting shoes against the wire in a fixed geometry.

Of the three, the pantograph method is best suited for high-speed operation. Some locomotives use both overhead and third rail collection (e.g. British Rail Class 92).
In Europe, the recommended geometry and shape of pantographs are defined by standard EN 50367/IEC 60486

====Third rail====

Mass transit systems and suburban lines often use a third rail instead of overhead wire. It allows for smaller tunnels and lower clearance under bridges, and has advantages for intensive traffic that it is a very sturdy system, not sensitive to snapping overhead wires. Some systems use four rails, especially some lines in the London Underground. One setback for third rail systems is that level crossings become more complex, usually requiring a gap section.

The original Baltimore and Ohio Railroad electrification used a sliding pickup (a contact shoe or simply the &quot;shoe&quot;) in an overhead channel, a system quickly found to be unsatisfactory. It was replaced by a third rail, in which a pickup rides underneath or on top of a smaller rail parallel to the main track, above ground level. There are multiple pickups on both sides of the locomotive in order to accommodate the breaks in the third rail required by trackwork. This system is preferred in subways because of the close clearances it affords.

===Driving the wheels===

During the initial development of railroad electrical propulsion, a number of drive systems were devised to couple the output of the traction motors to the wheels. Early locomotives often used jackshaft drives. In this arrangement, the traction motor is mounted within the body of the locomotive and drives the jackshaft through a set of gears. This system was employed because the first traction motors were too large and heavy to mount directly on the axles. Due to the number of mechanical parts involved, frequent maintenance was necessary. The jackshaft drive was abandoned for all but the smallest units when smaller and lighter motors were developed,

Several other systems were devised as the electric locomotive matured. The Buchli drive was a fully spring-loaded system, in which the weight of the driving motors was completely disconnected from the driving wheels. First used in electric locomotives from the 1920s, the Buchli drive was mainly used by the French SNCF and Swiss Federal Railways. The quill drive was also developed about this time and mounted the traction motor above or to the side of the axle and coupled to the axle through a reduction gear and a hollow shaft – the quill – flexibly connected to the driving axle. The Pennsylvania Railroad GG1 locomotive used a quill drive. Again, as traction motors continued to shrink in size and weight, quill drives gradually fell out of favor in low-speed freight locomotives. In high-speed passenger locomotives used in Europe, the quill drive is still predominant.

Another drive was the &quot;bi-polar&quot; system, in which the motor armature was the axle itself, the frame and field assembly of the motor being attached to the truck (bogie) in a fixed position. The motor had two field poles, which allowed a limited amount of vertical movement of the armature. This system was of limited value since the power output of each motor was limited. The EP-2 bi-polar electrics used by the Milwaukee Road compensated for this problem by using a large number of powered axles.

Modern freight electric locomotives, like their Diesel–electric counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, one side of the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as support. Power transfer from the motor to the axle is effected by spur gearing, in which a pinion on the motor shaft engages a bull gear on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.

===Wheel arrangements===

The Whyte notation system for classifying steam locomotives is not adequate for describing the variety of electric locomotive arrangements, though the Pennsylvania Railroad applied classes to its electric locomotives as if they were steam. For example, the PRR GG1 class indicates that it is arranged like two 4-6-0 class G locomotives coupled back-to-back.

UIC classification system was typically used for electric locomotives, as it could handle the complex arrangements of powered and unpowered axles and could distinguish between coupled and uncoupled drive systems.

===Battery locomotive===

A battery–electric locomotive (or battery locomotive) is powered by onboard batteries; a kind of battery electric vehicle.

Such locomotives are used where a diesel or conventional electric locomotive would be unsuitable. An example is maintenance trains on underground lines when the electricity supply is turned off. Another use for battery locomotives is in industrial facilities (e.g. explosives factories, oil, and gas refineries or chemical factories) where a combustion-powered locomotive (i.e., steam- or diesel-powered) could cause a safety issue due to the risks of fire, explosion or fumes in a confined space. Battery locomotives are preferred for mine railways where gas could be ignited by trolley-powered units arcing at the collection shoes, or where excessive electrical resistance could develop in the supply or return circuits, especially due to poor contact at rail joints, and allow dangerous current leakage into the ground.

The first electric locomotive built in 1837 was a battery locomotive. It was built by chemist Robert Davidson of Aberdeen in Scotland, and it was powered by galvanic cells (batteries). Another early example was at the Kennecott Copper Mine, McCarthy, Alaska, wherein 1917 the underground haulage ways were widened to enable working by two battery locomotives of . In 1928, Kennecott Copper ordered four 700-series electric locomotives with onboard batteries. These locomotives weighed and operated on 750 volts overhead trolley wire with considerable further range whilst running on batteries. The locomotives provided several decades of service using nickel–iron battery (Edison) technology. The batteries were replaced with lead-acid batteries, and the locomotives were retired shortly afterward. All four locomotives were donated to museums, but one was scrapped. The others can be seen at the Boone and Scenic Valley Railroad, Iowa, and at the Western Railway Museum in Rio Vista, California.

The Toronto Transit Commission previously operated on the Toronto subway a battery electric locomotive built by Nippon Sharyo in 1968 and retired in 2009.

London Underground regularly operates battery–electric locomotives for general maintenance work.

, battery locomotives with 7 and 14 MWh energy capacity have been ordered by rail lines and are under development.

===Supercapacitor power storage===
In 2020, Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Company, manufacturers of stored electrical power systems using supercapacitors initially developed for use in trams, announced that they were extending their product line to include locomotives.

==Electric locomotives around the world==

===Europe===
Electrification is widespread in Europe, with electric multiple units commonly used for passenger trains. Due to higher density schedules, operating costs are more dominant with respect to the infrastructure costs than in the U.S. and electric locomotives have much lower operating costs than diesel. In addition, governments were motivated to electrify their railway networks due to coal shortages experienced during the First and Second World Wars.

Diesel locomotives have less power compared to electric locomotives for the same weight and dimensions. For instance, the 2,200 kW of a modern British Rail Class 66 diesel locomotive was matched in 1927 by the electric SBB-CFF-FFS Ae 4/7 (2,300 kW), which is lighter. However, for low speeds, the tractive effort is more important than power. Diesel engines can be competitive for slow freight traffic (as it is common in Canada and the U.S.) but not for passenger or mixed passenger/freight traffic as on many European railway lines, especially where heavy freight trains must be run at comparatively high speeds (80 km/h or more).

These factors led to high degrees of electrification in most European countries. In some countries, such as Switzerland, even electric shunters are common and many private sidings are served by electric locomotives. During World War II, when materials to build new electric locomotives were not available, Swiss Federal Railways installed electric heating elements in the boilers of some steam shunters, fed from the overhead supply, to deal with the shortage of imported coal.

Recent political developments in many European countries to enhance public transit have led to another boost for electric traction. In addition, gaps in the unelectrified track are closed to avoid replacing electric locomotives by diesel for these sections. The necessary modernization and electrification of these lines are possible, due to the financing of the railway infrastructure by the state.

British electric multiple units were first introduced in the 1890s, and current versions provide public transit and there are also a number of electric locomotive classes, such as: Class 76, Class 86, Class 87, Class 90, Class 91 and Class 92.
===Russia and former USSR===

Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union have a mix of 3,000 V DC and 25 kV AC for historical reasons.

The special &quot;junction stations&quot; (around 15 over the former USSR – Vladimir, Mariinsk near Krasnoyarsk, etc.) have wiring switchable from DC to AC. Locomotive replacement is essential at these stations and is performed together with the contact wiring switching.

Most Soviet, Czech (the USSR ordered passenger electric locomotives from Škoda), Russian and Ukrainian locomotives can operate on AC or DC only. For instance, VL80 is an AC machine, with VL10 a DC version. There were some half-experimental small series such as VL82, which could switch from AC to DC and were used in small amounts around the city of Kharkiv in Ukraine, where is no junction station at many lines. Also, the latest Russian passenger locomotive EP20 and its half-experimental predecessor EP10 are a dual system.

Historically, 3,000 V DC was used for simplicity. The first experimental track was in the Georgian mountains, then the suburban zones of the largest cities were electrified for EMUs – very advantageous due to the much better dynamic of such a train compared to the steam one, which is important for suburban service with frequent stops. Then the large mountain line between Ufa and Chelyabinsk was electrified.

For some time, electric railways were only considered to be suitable for suburban or mountain lines. In around 1950, a decision was made (according to legend, by Joseph Stalin) to electrify the highly loaded plain prairie line of Omsk-Novosibirsk. After this, electrifying the major railroads at 3,000 V DC became mainstream.

25 kV AC started in the USSR in around 1960 when the industry managed to build the rectifier-based AC-wire DC-motor locomotive (all Soviet and Czech AC locomotives were such; only the post-Soviet ones switched to electronically controlled induction motors). The first major line with AC power was Mariinsk-Krasnoyarsk-Tayshet-Zima; the lines in European Russia such as Moscow-Rostov-on-Don followed.

In the 1990s, some DC lines were rebuilt as AC to allow the usage of the huge 10 MW AC locomotive of VL85. The line around Irkutsk is one of them. The DC locomotives freed by this rebuild were transferred to the St Petersburg region.

The Trans-Siberian Railway has been partly electrified since 1929, entirely since 2002. The system is 25 kV AC 50 Hz after the junction station of Mariinsk near Krasnoyarsk, 3,000 V DC before it, and train weights are up to 6,000 tonnes.

===North America===
====Canada====

Historically, Canada has used a variety of electric locomotives, primarily for moving passengers and cargo through poorly ventilated tunnels. Electric locomotives that were in use in Canada include the St. Clair Tunnel Co. Boxcab Electric, CN Boxcab Electric, and GMD GF6C. Exo in Montreal operated ALP-45DP dual-mode electro-diesel locomotives in order to allow the locomotives to traverse the poorly ventilated Mount Royal Tunnel. The locomotives run in electric mode along the entire length of the Deux-Montagnes line and along the Mascouche line between Montreal Central Station and Ahuntsic station. The locomotives run in diesel mode for the remainder of the Mascouche line and along three other non-electrified lines. However, with the conversion of the Mount Royal Tunnel into the mainline of the Réseau express métropolitain light metro system and the permanent truncation of the Mascouche line to Ahuntsic station starting in January 2020, the locomotives are run exclusively in diesel mode.

Similar to the US the flexibility of diesel locomotives and the relatively low cost of their infrastructure has led them to prevail except where legal or operational constraints dictate the use of electricity. Leading to limited electric railway infrastructure and by extension electric locomotives operating in Canada today. As of 2021, only one example exists today, GMD SW1200MG electric locomotives operated by the Iron Ore Company of Canada for a small isolated railway hauling raw ore from their Carol Lake mine to a processing plant.

In the future Toronto&#x27;s GO Transit plans to operate a fleet of new electric locomotives as a part of its Regional Express Rail initiative. The feasibility of using hydrogen fuel-cell locomotives is also being studied.

====United States====
Electric locomotives are used for passenger trains on Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor between Washington, DC, and Boston, with a branch to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and on some commuter rail lines. Mass transit systems and other electrified commuter lines use electric multiple units, where each car is powered. All other long-distance passenger service and, with rare exceptions, all freight is hauled by diesel–electric locomotives.

In North America, the flexibility of diesel locomotives and the relatively low cost of their infrastructure have led them to prevail except where legal or operational constraints dictate the use of electricity. An example of the latter is the use of electric locomotives by Amtrak and commuter railroads in the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak and New Jersey Transit&#x27;s New York corridor use electric locomotives, currently ALP-46s, due to the prohibition on diesel operation in Penn Station and the Hudson and East River Tunnels leading to it. Some other trains to Penn Station use dual-mode locomotives that can also operate off third-rail power in the tunnels and the station.

During the steam era, some mountainous areas were electrified but these have been discontinued. The junction between electrified and non-electrified territory is the locale of engine changes; thus Northeast Corridor trains that extend south of Washington, D.C., change locomotives there. Northeast Corridor trains used to make lengthy stops in New Haven, Connecticut, as locomotives were swapped, a delay which contributed to the decision to electrify the New Haven to Boston segment of the Northeast Corridor in 2000.

===Asia===

====China====
China has over of electrified railway. With most trunk line freight and long-distance passenger trains operated using high power electric locomotives, typically in excess of of power output. Heavy freight is hauled with extremely high power multi-section locomotives, reaching up to on the &quot;Shen 24&quot; series of six section electric locomotives.

====India====
All mainline electrified routes in India use 25 kV AC overhead electrification at 50 Hz. As of March 2017, Indian Railways haul 85% of freight and passenger traffic with electric locomotives and 45,881 km of railway lines have been electrified.

====Japan====

Japan has come close to complete electrification largely due to the relatively short distances and mountainous terrain, which make electric service a particularly economical investment. Additionally, the mix of freight to passenger service is weighted much more toward passenger service (even in rural areas) than in many other countries, and this has helped drive government investment into the electrification of many remote lines. However, these same factors lead operators of Japanese railways to prefer EMUs over electric locomotives. The vast majority of electric passenger service in Japan is operated with EMUs, relegating electric locomotives to freight and select long-distance services.

===Australia===

The Victorian Railways and New South Wales Government Railways, which pioneered electric traction in Australia in the early 20th century and continue to operate 1,500 V DC electric multiple units, have withdrawn their electric locomotives.

In both states, the use of electric locomotives on principal interurban routes proved to be a qualified success. In Victoria, because only the Gippsland line was electrified, the economic advantages of electric traction were not fully realized due to the need to change locomotives for trains that ran beyond the electrified network. The Victorian Railways L class were withdrawn from service by 1987, and the Gippsland line electrification had been dismantled by 2004.

The New South Wales 86 class locomotives introduced to NSW in 1983 had a relatively short life because the cost of maintaining the infrastructure, the need to change locomotives at the extremities of the electrified network, and higher charges levied for electricity, saw diesel locomotives take over services the electrified network.

Queensland Rail implemented electrification in the 1980s and utilises the more recent 25 kV AC technology with around 1,000 km of the narrow gauge network now electrified. It operates a fleet of electric locomotives to transport coal for export, the most recent of which the 3,000 kW (4,020 HP) 3300/3400 class.

<text>Hyde Park Corner is between Knightsbridge, Belgravia and Mayfair in London, England. It primarily refers to a major road junction at the southeastern corner of Hyde Park, that was originally planned by architect Decimus Burton. The junction includes a broad green-space roundabout in its centre, which is now the setting for Burton&#x27;s triumphal Wellington Arch. 

Six streets converge at the junction: Park Lane (from the north), Piccadilly (northeast), Constitution Hill (southeast), Grosvenor Place (south), Grosvenor Crescent (southwest) and Knightsbridge (west). Hyde Park Corner tube station served by the Piccadilly line has many accessways around the junction as do its notable monuments. Immediately to the north of the junction is Burton&#x27;s Ionic Screen gateway entrance to Hyde Park, and Apsley House museum, the 18th century townhouse of the 1st Duke of Wellington, hero of Waterloo.

== Creation by Decimus Burton ==

===Central London parks===
During the second half of the 1820s, the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and King George IV resolved that Hyde Park, and the area around it, must be renovated to the extent of the splendour of rival European capital cities, and that the essence of the new arrangement would be a triumphal approach to Buckingham Palace, which had been recently completed. The committee of the project, led by the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, and advised by Charles Arbuthnot, President of the Board of Commissioners of Woods and Forests, selected Decimus Burton as the project&#x27;s architect: in 1828, when giving evidence to a Parliamentary Select Committee on the Government&#x27;s spending on public works, Arbuthnot explained that he had nominated Burton &#x27;having seen in the Regent&#x27;s Park, and elsewhere, works which pleased my eye, from their architectural beauty and correctness&#x27;. Burton intended to create an urban space dedicated to the celebration of the House of Hanover, national pride, and the nation&#x27;s heroes.

The renovation of Hyde Park, Green Park, and St James&#x27;s Park, began, in 1825, with the demarcation of new drives and pathways, subsequent to which Burton designed new lodges and gates, viz. Cumberland Gate, Stanhope Gate, Grosvenor Gate, the Hyde Park Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner, and, later, the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Gate, Knightsbridge, in the classical style. There were no authoritative precedents for such buildings, which required windows and chimney stacks, in the classical style, and, in the words of Guy Williams, &#x27;Burton&#x27;s reticent treatment of the supernumerary features&#x27; and of the cast iron gates and railings, was &#x27;greatly admired&#x27;.

At Hyde Park Corner, the King required that &#x27;some great ceremonial outwork that would be worthy of the new palace that lay to its rear&#x27;, and accepted Burton&#x27;s consequent proposal for a sequence comprising a gateway and a classical screen, and a triumphal arch, which would enable those approaching Buckingham Palace from the north to ride or drive first through the screen and then through the arch, before turning left to descend Constitution Hill and enter the forecourt of Buckingham Palace through John Nash&#x27;s Marble Arch. The screen became the Roman revival Hyde Park Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner, which delighted the King and his Committee, and which architectural historian Guy Williams describes as &#x27;one of the most pleasing architectural works that have survived from the neo-classical age&#x27;. The triumphal arch became the Wellington Arch on Constitution Hill facing Green Park, which has been described as &#x27;one of London&#x27;s best loved landmarks&#x27;. Burton&#x27;s original design for the triumphal arch, which was modelled on the Arch of Titus at Rome, on which the central and side blocks of the Screen had been modelled, was more technically perfect, and coherent with the Screen, than that of the arch that was built: this original design, however, was rejected by the Committee—who had envisaged a design based on the Arch of Constantine (on which Nash&#x27;s Marble Arch had been modelled)—because it was not sufficiently ostentatious. Burton created a new design, &#x27;to pander to the majestic ego&#x27;, which was much larger and modelled on a fragment found in the Ancient Roman Forum, which was accepted on 14 January 1826, and subsequently built as the present Wellington Arch.

===Sculpture of the Triumphal Arch===
The arch at Constitution Hill was left devoid of decorative sculpture as a result of the moratorium in 1828 on public building work, and, instead, despite the absolute objection of Burton, was mounted with an ungainly equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington by Matthew Cotes Wyatt, the son of the then recently deceased James Wyatt, who had been selected by statue&#x27;s commissioner, and one of its few subsequent advocates, Sir Frederick Trench. Matthew Cotes Wyatt was not competent: Guy Williams contends that he was &#x27;not noticeably talented&#x27;, and the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; that &#x27;thanks to royal and other influential patronage, Wyatt enjoyed a reputation and practice to which his mediocre abilities hardly entitled him&#x27;. Trench, and his patron John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland, had told the public subscribers to the statue that the statue would be placed on top of Burton&#x27;s triumphal arch at Hyde Park Corner: Burton expressed his opposition to this proposal &#x27;as plainly and as vehemently as his nature allowed&#x27; consistently over successive years, because the ungainly statue would &#x27;disfigure&#x27; his arch, for which it was much too large, and the surrounding neighbourhood, because it would have to be placed, contrary to all classical precedent, across, instead of parallel with, the roadway under the arch. Burton had envisaged that his arch would be topped with only a small quadriga whose horses would have been parallel with the road under the arch. Burton&#x27;s objections were extensively endorsed by most of the aristocratic residents of London. A writer in &quot;The Builder&quot; asked Lord Canning, the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests, to ban the project: &quot;We have learnt, and can state positively, that Mr. Burton has the strongest objection possible against placing the group in question on the archway... and that he is taking no part whatever in the alteration proposed to be made in the upper part of the structure to prepare it to receive the pedestal... Mr. Burton, through the mildness which characterizes him, has not expressed this opinion so loudly and so publicly as he ought to have done... an opinion prevails very generally, that he is a party to the proceedings, and this has induced many to be silent who would otherwise have spoken...&quot;. The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, contended that another site would be preferable, and proposed, on behalf of the Crown, to offer any other site, but the statue&#x27;s subscribers rejected all alternative proposals. Every single MP except Sir Frederick Trench wanted the statue to be placed elsewhere. Canning wrote that &#x27;the remonstrances which reach Her Majesty&#x27;s Government against the proposed appropriation of the arch are so many and so strong, the representations of its architect, Mr. Burton, in the same sense, are so earnest, and the opinion of every other eminent architect, artist, or other competent authority who has been consulted on the subject is so decided [against the placing of the Wellington statue on the arch]&quot;&quot;.

Decimus Burton himself wrote, &quot;The arch would, I consider, suffer greatly in importance if the colossal statue in question be placed there, because it would become a mere pedestal. The want of proportion in the proposed surmount, compared with the columns and other details of the architecture, would show that they had been designed by different hands, and without reference for each other. ...I have desired to witness the completion of this building, as originally designed by me, and as approved by the Lords of the Treasury, yet I would prefer that the building should remain for the present in its forlorn and bare state, rather than a colossal equestrian statue should be placed upon it... I fear that if this appropriation of the building should be decided upon, a proposition would soon be made for removing altogether the facades of columns, the slender proportions of which would appear so incongruous and out of proportion compared with the prodigious dimensions of the statue&quot;. Burton had realized that the disciples of Pugin and advocates of Pugin&#x27;s anti-classicism would remove all classical elements from his arch if permitted the opportunity to do so.

The Government placed the Wellington statue on the arch in autumn 1846: Williams contends that the product was &#x27;ridiculous&#x27;. &quot;The Builder&quot; contended, &quot;down, unquestionably, it must come. As the network of timber is removed, spar by spar, from before it, so do the folly of the experiment, the absurdity of the conjunction, and the greatness of the sacrifice become apparent. Its effect is even worse than we anticipated - the destruction of the arch by the statue, and of the statue by its elevation on the arch, more complete. Every post brings us letters urging renewed efforts to remove the figure to another site&quot;. The contestation about the prospective removal of the statue became national. However, the Government failed to remove the statue, despite that they had professed, when it had been placed, that they would do so if it provoked the aversion which it had provoked. Foreign intellectuals who visited London identified the incongruous fusion of the statue and the arch as &#x27;spectacular confirmation&#x27; of the &#x27;artistic ignorance of the English&#x27;. Architectural historian Guy Williams writes that &quot;[the] arch at Hyde Park Corner is a visible reminder of one of the fiercest attacks that have ever been launched in the worlds of art and architecture. The face of London might have been very different now - freer, perhaps, of the &#x27;monstrous carbuncles&#x27; so disliked by the present Prince of Wales - if the attacked party [Decimus Burton] had been a little more pugnacious, and so better equipped to stand his ground&quot;.

During 1882, traffic congestion at Hyde Park Corner motivated advocacy for Burton&#x27;s triumphal arch to be moved to the top of Constitution Hill to create space for traffic. In response to this advocacy, Burton&#x27;s great-nephew Francis Fearon compiled and published a pamphlet that advocated the removal of the Wellington statue from the arch in the event of the removal of the arch to another location: Fearon contended that the arch should be &#x27;relieved once and for all of its unsightly load&#x27;. The campaign led by Fearon was successful: Wyatt&#x27;s incongruous statue was removed to Aldershot, and its place on Burton&#x27;s arch, which was moved to Constitution Hill in 1883, was occupied by a Quadriga by Captain Adrian Jones. Jones&#x27; statue is not nearly as elegant as Burton&#x27;s designed statue intended for the arch, but it is more coherent with the arch than Wyatt&#x27;s statue, and its figures, unlike those of Wyatt&#x27;s statue, are aligned with the roadway under the arch. The boundary of Buckingham Palace Garden was moved south, and a new road named Duke of Wellington Place was created; this separated the space containing the Arch from the rest of the Green Park.

===Development subsequent to Decimus Burton===
Following the passage of the Park Lane Improvement Act 1958, Park Lane was widened in the early 1960s. For most of its length this was achieved by converting the former East Carriage Drive of Hyde Park into the northbound lanes of a dual carriageway, but at Hyde Park Corner, all lanes of traffic came together on a line immediately to the east of Apsley House that required demolition of houses on Piccadilly. This left Apsley House on an island site. The InterContinental London hotel was subsequently built on the cleared site between the new route of Park Lane and Hamilton Place.

At part of the same scheme, a tunnel was constructed beneath the junction to allow traffic to flow freely between Knightsbridge and Piccadilly. As a result, the area around the Arch became a large traffic island, mostly laid to grass, and accessible only by pedestrian underpassess, and formally ceased to be part of the Green Park.

Subsequent changes to the road layout in the 1990s reinstated a route between Hyde Park and the Green Park for pedestrians, cyclists and horseriders using surface-level crossings.

The traffic island includes a smaller equestrian statue of Wellington by Joseph Edgar Boehm—unveiled in 1888—the Machine Gun Corps Memorial, the Royal Artillery Memorial, the Australian War Memorial and the New Zealand War Memorial.

Other monuments in the vicinity of Hyde Park Corner include Adrian Jones&#x27;s Monument to the Cavalry of the Empire (off the west side of Park Lane), Alexander Munro&#x27;s &quot;Boy and Dolphin&quot; statue (in a rose garden parallel to Rotten Row, going west from Hyde Park Corner), the Queen Elizabeth Gate (behind Apsley House), the Wellington Monument (off the west side of Park Lane), and a statue of Lord Byron (on a traffic island opposite the Wellington Monument).

The term is often erroneously used for Speakers&#x27; Corner, at the north-eastern corner of Hyde Park.

<text>A concept car (also known as a concept vehicle or show vehicle) is a car made to showcase new styling or new technology. Concept cars are often exhibited at motor shows to gauge customer reaction to new and radical designs which may or may not be produced. 

General Motors designer Harley Earl is generally credited with inventing the concept car, and did much to popularize it through its traveling Motorama shows of the 1950s.

Concept cars never go into production directly. In modern times, all would have to undergo many changes before the design is finalized for the sake of practicality, safety, regulatory compliance, and cost. A &quot;production-intent&quot; prototype, as opposed to a concept vehicle, serves this purpose.

== Design ==

Concept cars are often radical in engine or design. Some use non-traditional, exotic, or expensive materials, ranging from paper to carbon fiber to refined alloys. Others have unique layouts, such as gullwing doors, three or five (or more) wheels, or special abilities not usually found on cars. Because of these often impractical or unprofitable leanings, many concept cars never get past scale models or even drawings. Other more traditional concepts can be developed into fully drivable (operational) vehicles with a working drivetrain and accessories. The state of most concept cars lies somewhere in between and does not represent the final product. A very small proportion of concept cars are functional to any useful extent, and some cannot move safely at speeds above .

Inoperative &quot;mock-ups&quot; are usually made of wax, clay, metal, fiberglass, plastic, or a combination thereof.

If drivable, the drivetrain is often borrowed from a production vehicle from the same company or may have defects and imperfections in design. They can also be quite refined, such as General Motors&#x27; Cadillac Sixteen concept.

<text>Constitution Hill is a road in the City of Westminster in London. It connects the western end of The Mall (just in front of Buckingham Palace) with Hyde Park Corner, and is bordered by Buckingham Palace Gardens to the south, and Green Park to the north. At the top of the rise in the roadway at the Corner is the Wellington Arch, near where the road is flanked by the Memorial Gates war memorial.

==Name==
The origin of the name is uncertain. Parliamentary records from 1642 show a reference to &quot;a small redoubt and battery on Constitution Hill&quot;. One theory is that King Charles II had a habit of taking &quot;constitutional&quot; walks there. In Strype&#x27;s Map, 1720, it is marked &quot;Road to Kensington&quot;. In John Smith&#x27;s map of 1724, it is called &quot;Constitution Hill&quot;.

An old lane on this route was widened in connection with the development of Buckingham Palace in the 1820s by John Nash. It formed a processional route from the palace to Hyde Park. It is now closed to traffic on Sundays and public holidays.

==History==
One account has Charles&#x27; brother, James, Duke of York returning from a hunt on Hounslow Heath and stopping his coach along Constitution Hill to avoid hitting the king walking across the road. Upon wondering if Charles put himself in danger by walking out in front of a vehicle, the King replied, &quot;No danger whatever, James, for I am sure that no man in England would take my life to make you king.&quot;

Constitution Hill was a popular spot for duels. On 11 January 1696, Sir Henry Colt, 1st Baronet was challenged to a duel by Robert &quot;Beau&quot; Fielding (future husband of Charles II&#x27;s mistress Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland), near what is now the site of Bridgewater House. Fielding injured the Baronet, but was subsequently disarmed, ending the fight. In 1730, William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath duelled with John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey.

The area was the scene of three assassination attempts on Queen Victoria—in 1840 (by Edward Oxford), 1842 (by John Francis) and 1849 (by William Hamilton). In 1850, the former Conservative Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel was thrown from his horse on Constitution Hill by the gate into Green Park; he suffered a fatal injury and died three days later.

Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner sits at the end of the road by Apsley House. It was designed by Decimus Burton and completed in 1828. A major restoration project by English Heritage was undertaken between 1999 and 2001. In 2002, war memorial to over five million Commonwealth soldiers, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Africa, Caribbean and Nepal, was constructed near the top of Constitution Hill, just before Hyde Park Corner; the memorial is known as the Memorial Gates. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 6 November.

Large concrete lamp posts were installed in Constitution Hill in the 1960s. Thanks to the swift intervention of comedian and enthusiastic environmentalist Spike Milligan they were removed within days and the old gas lamps are still there.

<text>The English Electric Company Limited (EE) was a British industrial manufacturer formed after World War I by amalgamating five businesses which, during the war, made munitions, armaments and aeroplanes.

It initially specialised in industrial electric motors and transformers, locomotives and traction equipment, diesel motors and steam turbines. Its products were later expanded to include consumer electronics, nuclear reactors, guided missiles, military aircraft and mainframe computers.

Two English Electric aircraft designs became landmarks in British aeronautical engineering; the Canberra and the Lightning. In 1960, English Electric Aircraft (40%) merged with Vickers (40%) and Bristol (20%) to form British Aircraft Corporation.

In 1968 English Electric&#x27;s operations were merged with GEC&#x27;s, the combined business employing more than 250,000 people.

==Foundation==
Aiming to turn their employees and other assets to peaceful productive purposes, the owners of a series of businesses decided to merge them forming The English Electric Company Limited in December 1918.

===Components===
English Electric was formed to acquire ownership of:
* Coventry Ordnance Works of Coventry, which retained a separate identity, and their ordnance works at Scotstoun which was later sold to Harland and Wolff in April 1920.
* Phoenix Dynamo Manufacturing Company of Bradford
* Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. of Preston founded 1880 and its subsidiaries:
** United Electric Car Company of Preston
** Willans &amp; Robinson of Rugby which retained a separate identity—not wholly owned.
The owners of the component companies took up the shares in English Electric.

====Planned activities of the combined businesses====
John Pybus was appointed managing director in March 1921 and chairman in April 1926. Initially J H Mansell of Coventry Ordnance Works, John Pybus of Phoenix Dynamo Manufacturing and W Rutherford of Dick, Kerr were joint managing directors.&lt;br&gt;The five previously independent major operations under their control had these principal capabilities:
* Coventry Ordnance Works: the plant was built for the production of heavy armaments but was suitable for the manufacture of large generating units
* Phoenix Dynamo Works: during the war production was shells and aeroplanes but by July 1919 had been returned to electric motors
* Dick, Kerr and United Electric Car: special war work munitions, aeroplanes and metallic filament lamps, prior to the war locomotives and tram cars
* Willans &amp; Robinson: made steam turbines, condensers and diesel motors, there was a foundry
Together these businesses covered the whole field of electrical machinery from the smallest fan motor to the largest turbo-generator.

In November 1919, English Electric bought the Stafford works of Siemens Brothers Dynamo Works Ltd. In 1931 Stafford became English Electric&#x27;s centre.

However, there was no post-war boom in electrical generation. Though English Electric products were indeed in heavy demand, potential buyers were unable to raise the necessary capital funds. In 1922, a drastic reorganisation of the works was carried through and that managed to halve overheads. The Coventry Ordnance Works was practically closed down. Cables, lamps and wireless equipment were then in buoyant demand, but that would have been a new field for the company to enter. English Electric&#x27;s business was in heavy electrical and mechanical plant. Both the 1926 general strike and the miners strike caused heavy losses. In 1929 part of the Coventry Ordnance Works was sold and the pattern shop at Preston, neither of which was required.

By the end of 1929, it was clear the only solution to English Electric&#x27;s financial difficulties was a financial restructure. The restructure acknowledged the loss of much of the shareholders&#x27; capital and brought in new capital to re-equip with new plant and machinery. In the event, an American syndicate fronted by Lazard Brothers and Co. bankers came up with the new capital, but left control in the hands of the previous shareholders.

In June 1930, four fresh directors were appointed, filling four new vacancies.

Ten days later, there was a formal announcement of an American arrangement. &quot;English Electric, with works at Preston, Stafford, Rugby, Bradford and Coventry, had entered into a comprehensive arrangement&quot; with Westinghouse Electric International Company of New York and Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company of East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania US, whereby there would be an exchange of technical information between the two organisations on steam turbines and electrical apparatus. It was made clear that this technical and manufacturing link did not carry with it any control from America. In recognition of the exchange arrangement, Westinghouse had offered to provide further capital, which would be less than 10% of the total, including that new capital organised earlier by Lazard Brothers.

==George Nelson==
Seven weeks later the chairman, Lionel Hichens, who had temporarily replaced John Pybus in 1927, retired at the end of July 1930 and was replaced by Sir Holberry Mensforth as a director and as chairman. It was then announced that George H. Nelson had been appointed to the board and would take up the position of managing director early in October. Mensforth had been taken away from his position as general manager of American Westinghouse Trafford Park Manchester, where George Nelson had been his apprentice, in 1919 by the Minister of Transport. The minister had given Mensforth the responsibility of easing the transition of the nation&#x27;s munitions businesses back into peacetime industry. It was Mensforth who had arranged the technical exchange agreement and extra capital with Westinghouse. They began to reorganise.

===Relocations===

The main base of the company&#x27;s operation was moved from London to Stafford including the sales departments, general and factory accounts and the principal executives previously in London. The managing director was to divide his time between the various works but would be mainly in Stafford or in London

On 30 December 1930 the engineering shops at Preston closed leaving the following distribution:
*Preston: specialists in high-tension direct-current railway electrification, rolling stock and trolley buses Dick, Kerr
*Stafford: medium-sized electrical plant, transformers and switchgear and (from Preston) large turbo-alternator work Siemens
*Rugby: prime movers, steam turbines and condensing plant, Fullagar and Diesel engines and (from Preston) water turbine plant Willans &amp; Robinson
*Bradford: small motors and control gear and (from Preston) traction motor and traction control work Phoenix
*Coventry: engineers small tools (stopped in 1931), zed fuse (cartridge type) transferred to Stafford in 1931 C.O.W.

===Radiators and cookers===

Manufacture of domestic apparatus got underway at both Stafford and Bradford during 1931. They were followed in 1934 by a range of household meters of various kinds. In the same report to shareholders, the chairman pointed out that every day 330 more homes adopted electricity for heating cooking and lighting and between 1929 and 1935 the production of electricity in Britain had increased by 70 per cent.

===Recovery===
1933 proved to be the first of four years of real achievement. At the beginning of July 1933, Mensforth stepped down and George Nelson took up the post of chairman. Nelson remained managing director. Mensforth kept a seat on the board from which he later retired at the end of 1936.

English Electric&#x27;s recovery was noted by commentators as remarkable. During 1936, past preference dividends had been brought up to date: they were English Electric&#x27;s first dividend since a 1924 dividend on ordinary shares. The balance sheet at the end of 1936 showed liquidity was in a strong position and the chairman told shareholders that the rate of production in the factories for the last three months of the year was double the rate of production in the first three months.

During 1938, the first dividend was paid on ordinary shares since 1924.

In the summer of 1938, a large display advertisement confidently declared:
==World War II==

=== Airframes ===

The first steps to strengthen the Royal Air Force had been taken in May 1935 and English Electric was brought into the scheme for making airframes working in conjunction with Handley Page. The chairman reported to shareholders that though both Dick, Kerr and Phoenix were involved in the aircraft business during and shortly after the previous war the problems had so changed they were now completely new to the company. He also noted as he ended his address that the demand for domestic appliances including cookers, breakfast cookers, washing machines and water heaters was growing progressively.

The Preston works without subcontracting made more than 3,000 Hampden and Halifax aircraft.

=== Aero engines ===

In December 1942, English Electric bought the ordinary shares of D. Napier &amp; Son Limited. Mr H G Nelson, son of English Electric chairman George H Nelson, was appointed managing director.

Napier&#x27;s Sabre engines were used in Typhoon and Tempest aircraft and Lion engines in Motor Torpedo Boats

=== Tanks, locomotives, submarines, ships, power generation ===
The Stafford works made thousands of Covenanter, Centaur and Cromwell tanks as well as precision instruments for aircraft, electric propulsion and electrical equipment.&lt;br&gt;The Rugby works made Diesel engines for ships, submarines and locomotives, steam turbines for ships and turbo-alternator sets for power stations.&lt;br&gt;Bradford made electric generators for ships&#x27; auxiliaries and a wide variety of other naval and aviation material.

=== Employees ===
In April 1945, English Electric employed 25,000 persons in its four main works. Subsequently the chairman revealed that the peak employment number during wartime had been 45,000 when including Napier&#x27;s people. C. P. Snow was appointed director of scientific personnel in 1944. Later he was physicist-director, a position he held until 1964.

=== de Havilland Vampire ===
In September 1945, details were released of the Vampire jet, the fastest British aircraft with a top speed of 548 mph. The aircraft was built by English Electric at its Preston works, the Frank Halford designed Goblin jet engine, the world&#x27;s most powerful, by de Havilland in London.

==Peacetime==

===Trams===
From 1912 to 1924, United Electric and English Electric (with assistance from Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock) supplied second- and third-series tramcars for Hong Kong Tramways. These cars were eventually retired from 1924 to 1930 as the fourth Generation cars were being introduced.

===Railways===
In 1923, English Electric supplied the EO electric locomotives for the New Zealand Railways for use between Arthurs Pass and Otira, in the Southern Alps. Between 1924 and 1926, they delivered nine box-cab electric (B+B) locomotives to the Harbour Commissioners of Montreal (later the National Harbours Board); later they were transferred to Canadian National Railways, where four of them ran until 1995. In 1927, English Electric delivered 20 electric motor cars for Warsaw&#x27;s Warszawska Kolej Dojazdowa. During the 1930s, equipment was supplied for the electrification of the Southern Railway system, reinforcing EE&#x27;s position in the traction market, and it continued to provide traction motors to them for many years.

In 1936, production of diesel locomotives began in the former tramworks in Preston. Between the late 1930s and the 1950s, English Electric supplied electric multiple unit trains for the electrified network in and around Wellington, New Zealand. In 1951 English Electric supplied 3 &amp; 5 car articulated Diesel Electric multiple units to the Egyptian State Railways Egyptian-thumpers. Between 1951 and 1959, English Electric supplied the National Coal Board with five 51-ton, 400 hp electric shunting locomotives for use on the former Harton Coal Company System at South Shields (which had been electrified by Siemens in 1908) to supplement the existing fleet of ten ageing Siemens and AEG locomotives. English Electric took over Vulcan Foundry and Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns, both with substantial railway engineering pedigrees, in 1955.

English Electric produced nearly 1000 diesel and electric locomotives, of nine different classes, for British Rail as part of the Modernisation Plan in the 1950s and 1960s. Most of these classes of locomotive gave long service to British Rail and its successor train operating companies, some still being active well into the 21st century.

===Aviation===

Both Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. and the Phoenix Dynamo Manufacturing Company built aircraft in the First World War, including flying boats designed by the Seaplane Experimental Station at Felixstowe, 62 Short Type 184 and 6 Short Bombers designed by Short Brothers. Aircraft manufacture under the English Electric name began in Bradford in 1922 with the Wren but lasted only until 1926 after the last Kingston flying boat was built.

With War in Europe looming, English Electric was instructed by the Air Ministry to construct a &quot;shadow factory&quot; at Samlesbury Aerodrome in Lancashire to build Handley Page Hampden bombers. Starting with Flight Shed Number 1, the first Hampden built by English Electric made its maiden flight on 22 February 1940 and, by 1942, 770 Hampdens had been delivered – more than half of all the Hampdens produced. In 1940, a second factory was built on the site and the runway was extended to allow for construction of the Handley Page Halifax four-engined heavy bomber to begin. By 1945, five main hangars and three runways had been built at the site, which was also home to No. 9 Group RAF. By the end of the war, over 2,000 Halifaxes had been built and flown from Samlesbury.

In 1942, English Electric took over D. Napier &amp; Son, an aero-engine manufacturer. Along with the shadow factory, this helped to re-establish the company&#x27;s aeronautical engineering division. Post-war, English Electric invested heavily in this sector, moving design and experimental facilities to the former RAF Warton near Preston in 1947. This investment led to major successes with the Lightning and Canberra, the latter serving in a multitude of roles from 1951 until mid-2006 with the Royal Air Force.

At the end of the war, English Electric started production under licence of the second British jet fighter, the de Havilland Vampire, with 1,300 plus built at Samlesbury. Their own design work took off after the Second World War under W. E. W. Petter, formerly of Westland Aircraft. Although English Electric produced only two aircraft designs before their activities became part of BAC, the design team put forward suggestions for many Air Ministry projects.

The aircraft division was formed into the subsidiary English Electric Aviation Ltd. in 1958, becoming a founding constituent of the new British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in 1960; English Electric having a 40% stake in the latter company. The guided weapons division was added to BAC in 1963.

===Industrial Electronics===
The Industrial Electronics Division was established at Stafford. One of the products produced at this branch was the Igniscope, a revolutionary design of ignition tester for petrol engines. This was invented by Napiers and supplied as Type UED for military use during World War 2. After the war, it was marketed commercially as type ZWA.

===Mergers, acquisitions and demise===
In 1946, English Electric took over the Marconi Company, a foray into the domestic consumer electronic market. English Electric tried to take over one of the other major British electrical companies, the General Electric Company (GEC), in 1960 and, in 1963, English Electric and J. Lyons and Co. formed a jointly owned company – English Electric LEO Company – to manufacture the LEO computer developed by Lyons.

English Electric took over Lyons&#x27; half-stake in 1964 and merged it with Marconi&#x27;s computer interests to form English Electric Leo Marconi (English Electric LM). The latter was merged with Elliott Automation and International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) to form International Computers Limited (ICL) in 1967. In 1968 GEC, recently merged with Associated Electrical Industries (AEI), merged with English Electric; the former being the dominant partner, the English Electric name was then lost.

<doc id="390893" wikidata="Q216914" url="?curid=390893" title="St James's Park">
<text>St James&#x27;s Park is a urban park in the City of Westminster, central London. A Royal Park, it is at the southernmost end of the St James&#x27;s area, which was named after a once isolated medieval hospital dedicated to St James the Less, now the site of St James&#x27;s Palace. The area was initially enclosed for a deer park near the Palace of Whitehall for King Henry VIII in the 1530s. It is the most easterly of a near-continuous chain of public parks that includes (moving westward) Green Park, Hyde Park, and Kensington Gardens.

The park is bounded by Buckingham Palace to the west, The Mall to the north, Horse Guards to the east, and Birdcage Walk to the south. It meets Green Park at Queen&#x27;s Gardens with the Victoria Memorial at its centre, opposite the entrance to Buckingham Palace. St James&#x27;s Palace is on the opposite side of The Mall. The closest London Underground stations are St James&#x27;s Park, Green Park, Victoria, and Westminster.

The park is Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==Features==
The park has a small lake, St James&#x27;s Park Lake, with two islands, West Island and Duck Island, the latter named for the lake&#x27;s collection of waterfowl. At the end of the nineteenth century Duck Island was considered a sufficiently remote location for Scotland Yard to establish a bomb disposal facility there; the resident bird-keeper was given the responsibility of looking after the implements kept for dismantling the devices. It now houses pumps and water treatment machinery for the lake and fountains.

A resident colony of pelicans has been a feature of the park since a Russian ambassador donated them to Charles II in 1664. While most of the birds&#x27; wings are clipped, there is a pelican which can be seen flying, occasionally beyond the confines of the Park.

The Blue Bridge across the lake affords a tree-framed view west towards Buckingham Palace. Looking east, the view includes the Swire Fountain to the north of Duck Island and, past the lake, the grounds of Horse Guards Parade, with Horse Guards, the Old War Office and Whitehall Court behind. To the south of Duck Island is the Tiffany Fountain on Pelican Rock; and past the lake is the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, with the London Eye, the Shell Tower, and the Shard behind. The park has a children&#x27;s playground including a large sandpit.

The species of trees in the park include London planes, Scarlet oak, black mulberry, and a fig tree.

== History ==
In 1532, Henry VIII purchased from Eton College an area of marshland through which the Tyburn flowed. It lay to the west of York Place acquired by Henry from Cardinal Wolsey; it was purchased in order to turn York Place, subsequently renamed Whitehall, into a dwelling fit for a king. Henry enclosed the park for deer hunting and built St James Palace to initially serve as his hunting lodge. On James I&#x27;s accession to the throne in 1603, he ordered that the park be drained and landscaped, and exotic animals were kept in the park, including camels, crocodiles, an elephant and exotic birds, kept in aviaries.

While Charles II was in exile in France under the Commonwealth of England, he was impressed by the elaborate gardens at French royal palaces, and on his ascension he had the park redesigned in a more formal style, probably by the French landscaper André Mollet. A 775-metre by 38-metre (850 by 42-yard) ornamental canal was created as evidenced in the old plan. The king opened the park to the public and used the area to entertain guests and mistresses, such as Nell Gwyn. The park became notorious at the time as a meeting place for impromptu acts of lechery, as described by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester in his poem &quot;A Ramble in St James&#x27;s Park&quot;.

In the late 17th and early 18th centuries cows grazed on the park, and milk could be bought fresh at the &quot;Lactarian&quot;, described by Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach in 1710. The 18th century saw further changes, including the reclamation of part of the canal for Horse Guards Parade and the purchase of Buckingham House (now Buckingham Palace) at the west end of the Mall, for the use of Queen Charlotte in 1761.
Further remodelling in 1826–27, commissioned by the Prince Regent (later George IV) and overseen by the architect and landscaper John Nash, saw the canal&#x27;s conversion into a more naturally-shaped lake, and formal avenues rerouted to romantic winding pathways. At the same time, Buckingham House was expanded to create the palace, and Marble Arch was built at its entrance, whilst The Mall was turned into a grand processional route. It opened to public traffic 60 years later in 1887. The arch was moved to its current location at the junction of Oxford Street and Park Lane in 1851 and the Victoria Memorial was erected between 1906 and 1911.

<doc id="390896" wikidata="Q7984" url="?curid=390896" title="Chukotka Autonomous Okrug">
<text>Chukotka ( ; ), officially the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, is the easternmost federal subject of Russia. It is an autonomous okrug situated in the Russian Far East, and shares a border with the Sakha Republic to the west, Magadan Oblast to the south-west, and Kamchatka Krai to the south, as well as a maritime border on the Bering Strait with the U.S. state of Alaska to the east. Anadyr is the largest town and the capital, and the easternmost settlement to have town status in Russia. It is the closest point from Russia to the United States, measuring at 88.51 kilometres or 55 miles.

Chukotka is primarily populated by ethnic Russians, Chukchi, and other indigenous peoples. It is the only autonomous okrug in Russia that is not included in, or subordinate to, another federal subject, having separated from Magadan Oblast in 1992. It is home to Lake Elgygytgyn, an impact crater lake, and Anyuyskiy, an extinct volcano. The village of Uelen is the easternmost settlement in Russia and the closest substantial settlement to the United States (Alaska).

The autonomous okrug covers an area of over , and is the seventh-largest federal subject in Russia, although it has a population of only 50,526. Chukotka is the second-least-populated federal subject, and the least densely populated federal subject in Russia. The region is the northeasternmost region of Russia, and since the sale of Alaska in 1867, it has been the only part of Russia lying partially in the Western Hemisphere.

==Geography==
Chukotka is bordered in the north by the Chukchi Sea and the East Siberian Sea, which are part of the Arctic Ocean; in the east by the Bering Strait and the Bering Sea, part of the Pacific Ocean; in the south by Kamchatka Krai and Magadan Oblast; and in the west by the Sakha Republic. The Chukchi Peninsula projects eastward forming the Bering Strait between Siberia and the Alaska Peninsula, and encloses the north side of the Gulf of Anadyr. The peninsula&#x27;s easternmost point, Cape Dezhnev, is also the easternmost point of mainland Russia.

Ecologically, Chukotka can be divided into three distinct areas: the northern Arctic desert, the central tundra, and the taiga in the south. About half of its area is above the Arctic Circle. This area is very mountainous, containing the Chukotsky Mountains (highest point Iskhodnaya) and the Anadyr Highlands.

Chukotka&#x27;s rivers spring from its northern and central mountains. The major rivers are:
*Anadyr River, with tributaries Belaya, Tanyurer, Yablon, Yeropol, Mayn and Velikaya rivers, as well as the Avtatkuul River, which flows across the Anadyr Lowlands into the Gulf of Anadyr.
*Omolon and the Great and Little Anyuy Rivers that flow west into the Kolyma River in Yakutia (Sakha).
*Rauchua, Chaun, Palyavaam, Pegtymel, Chegitun and Amguyema Rivers that flow north into the arctic seas.

The largest lakes are Lake Krasnoye, west of Anadyr, Lake Pekulney and Lake Elgygytgyn in central Chukotka. Other important lakes are Koolen, Lake Ioni, Pychgynmygytgyn, Medvezhye, Achchyon and Maynits.

The okrug&#x27;s extensive coastline has several peninsulas, the main ones being the Kyttyk Peninsula, Cape Shelagsky, the Aachim Peninsula, the Chukchi Peninsula and Russkaya Koshka.

There are also several islands belonging to Chukotka, from west to east the main ones being Ayon Island, Ryyanranot Island, Chengkuul Island, Mosey Island, the Routan Islands, Shalaurov Island, Wrangel Island, Herald Island, Kosa Dvukh Pilotov Island, Karkarpko Island, Kolyuchin Island, Serykh Gusey Islands, Idlidlya Island, Big Diomede Island, Ilir Island, Arakamchechen Island, Yttygran Island, Merokinkan Island, Achinkinkan Island and Kosa Meechkyn Island.

Large parts of Chukotka are covered with moss, lichen, and arctic plants, similar to western Alaska. Surrounding the Gulf of Anadyr and in the river valleys grow small larch, pine, birch, poplar, and willow trees. More than 900 species of plants grow in Chukotka, including 400 species of moss and lichen. It is home to 220 bird species and 30 fresh water fish species.

===Climate===
Chukotka&#x27;s climate is influenced by its location on the three neighboring seas: the Bering Sea, the East Siberian Sea, and the Chukchi Sea with its weather characterized by cold northerly winds that can quickly change to wet southern winds. Cape Navarin has the highest number of hurricanes and storms in Russia. The coastal areas are windy with little precipitation, between per year. Temperature varies between in January, and between in July. Growing season is short, lasting only 80 to 100 days per year.

==History==
===Pre-history===
The first inhabitants were Paleo-Siberian hunters who came to Chukotka from Central and East Asia. The area was then part of the Beringia land bridge that is thought to have enabled human migration to the Americas.

===Pre-Russian===
Traditionally, Chukotka was the home of the native Chukchi people, Siberian Yupiks, Koryaks, Chuvans, Evens/Lamuts, Yukaghirs, and Inuit. As of 1930, the population was primarily Chukchi.

===Russian exploration and conquest===
After the Russians conquered the Kazan and Astrakhan Khanates in the 16th century, the trade routes to the Urals, Siberia, and Central Asia opened for travel and traders and Cossacks moved eastwards. The Cossacks built forts in strategic locations and subjected the indigenous people to the Tsar.
During the first half of the 17th century, Russians reached the far north-east. In 1641, the first reference to Chukchi people was made by the Cossacks. In 1649, Russian explorer Semyon Dezhnyov explored the far north-eastern coast and established winter quarters on the upstream portion of the Anadyr River that became the fortified settlement of Anadyrsk. Dezhnyov tried to subjugate the Chukchi and exact tribute during the next ten years, but was mostly unsuccessful. Eventually, the fort was abandoned, because of the harsh northern conditions and lack of game animals for food.

At the end of the 17th century, the fort regained some importance when the sea route from Anadyrsk to Kamchatka was discovered. It was used as the staging base for expeditions to Kamchatka and all other forts and settlements were made subject to Anadyrsk. When the wealth of Kamchatka&#x27;s natural resources was discovered, the Russian government started to give the far north-eastern region more serious attention. In 1725, Tsar Peter the Great ordered Vitus Bering to explore Kamchatka and Afanasy Shestakov to lead a military expedition to subjugate the Chukchi. This expedition failed when the fleet suffered shipwreck and the survivors, including Shestakov, were killed by the Chukchi.

In 1731, Dmitry Pavlutsky tried again, aided by Cossacks, Yukaghirs, and Koryaks (indigenous Siberian tribes that were subjugated earlier). Pavlutsky sailed up the Anadyr River and destroyed the Chukchi garrison on the Arctic Ocean. His ruthless methods had some limited success in forcing tribute from some Chukchi. But in 1747, the Chukchi defeated the Russian regiment and killed Pavlutsky.

Realizing that the Chukchi could not easily be subjugated by military means, the Russians changed tactics and offered the Chukchi citizenship in the Russian Empire. A peace treaty was concluded in 1778 in which the Chukchi were exempted from paying yasak.

That same year, British Captain James Cook made an exploration of Cape North (now Cape Schmidt) and Providence Bay. Anxious that other European powers would occupy the area, Tsaritsa Catherine II ordered the exploration and mapping of the area. Starting in 1785, an expedition led by Joseph Billings and Gavril Sarychev mapped the Chukchi Peninsula, the west coast of Alaska, and the Aleutian Islands. Then from 1821 to 1825, Ferdinand von Wrangel and Fyodor Matyushkin led expeditions along the coast of the East Siberian Sea and explored the Kolyma, Great Anyuy, and Little Anyuy Rivers.

===Western influence===
Chukotka remained mostly outside the control of the Russian Empire and consequently other foreign powers (American, British, Norwegian) began to hunt and trade in the area from about 1820 onwards. After the sale of Alaska to the United States, American whalers and traders especially extended their activities into Chukotka and foreign influence reached its peak. By 1880, the Russians reacted by setting up coastal patrols to stop American ships and confiscate their property. And in 1888, the administrative region of Anadyr was created. Yet Russian control diminished again and around 1900, a large stream of foreigners entered Chukotka, lured to the region by the Yukon gold rush in 1898.

In 1909, in order to keep the region within Russian control, two districts were created within the Anadyr Region: the districts of Anadyr and Chukotka. The Russian government granted concessions to foreign companies such as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the US Northeast Siberia Company, which was granted gold, iron, and graphite mining rights in the entire Chukotka between 1902 and 1912.

Wrangel Island in particular was subject to claims by the United States and Canada. In 1916, the Russians officially claimed the uninhabited island. But in 1921, Canadian Vilhjalmur Stefansson made a serious attempt to claim it for Canada by populating it and building a small settlement. Another contingent arrived in 1923 but a year later, the Soviets permanently conquered the island, removing the remaining inhabitants, and thereby ending all foreign influence.

===Soviet period===
Chukotka was subject to collectivization and resettlement of the indigenous people, but this process started later and was less extreme than in other parts of the Soviet Union.

When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, everything was done to start tin production as quickly as possible in Chukotka. Mining rapidly developed, and this industry would become its economic base. Also during the war, geologists discovered large reserves of gold that would be mined in the 1950s.

The Chukotka National Okrug (later Autonomous Okrug) was created in 1930 and was originally subordinated to Far Eastern Krai. In 1932, Kamchatka Oblast was created within the Far Eastern Krai (later Khabarovsk Krai) and was given jurisdiction over Chukotka from 1932 to 1953. Since the formation of Magadan Oblast from the northern parts of Khabarovsk Krai in 1953, Chukotka was administratively subordinated to the region.

===Russian Federation period===
In 1991, Chukotka declared its separation to become a subject of the Russian Federation in its own right, a move that was confirmed by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation in 1993.

From 2001 to 2008, Roman Abramovich was the Governor of Chukotka. He invested billions of rubles, including his own money, into the Chukotka economy by developing its infrastructure, schools, and housing. This has helped to double the GDP of the region and to more than triple the income of its residents. In 2004, Abramovich tried to resign from this position but was reappointed governor for another term by Vladimir Putin. In early July 2008, it was announced that President Dmitry Medvedev had accepted Abramovich&#x27;s latest request to resign as governor of Chukotka, although his various charitable activities in the region would continue. In the period 2000–2006 the average salaries in Chukotka increased from about US$165 (€117/£100) per month in 2000 to US$826 (€588/£500) per month in 2006.

On 11 July 2008, Dmitry Medvedev nominated Roman Kopin to be the governor. On 13 July, the local legislators unanimously confirmed Kopin as the next governor of Chukotka. As of 2023, Vladislav Kuznetsov is the current governor of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug.

==Economy==
Chukotka has large reserves of oil, natural gas, coal, gold, and tungsten, which are slowly being mined, but much of the rural population survives on subsistence reindeer herding, whale hunting, and fishing. The urban population is employed in mining, administration, construction, cultural work, education, medicine, and other occupations.

The largest companies in the region include Chukotka Mining and Geological Company (Highland Gold), Severnoye zoloto, Mayskoye Gold Mining Company (Polymetal), FSUE Chukotsnab. In April 2022, Kinross announced that it was selling 100% of its Russian assets following other international companies obliged to exit the Russian economy.

==Transportation==

Chukotka is mostly roadless and air travel is the main mode of passenger transport. There are local permanent roads between some settlements (e.g. Egvekinot-Iultin ()). When cold enough, winter roads are constructed on the frozen rivers to connect regional settlements in a uniform network. The Anadyr Highway is under construction to link Chukotka to Magadan, and to connect the settlements of Anadyr, Bilibino, Komsomolsky and Egvekinot within Chukotka.

In 2009, replacement of the emergency bridge through Loren River on the busy local road from Lavrentiya to Lorino () became the main event in transport in Chukotka.

The main airport is Ugolny Airport near Anadyr. Coastal shipping also takes place, but ice prevents this for at least half the year.

==Local government==
The legislative (representative) body of state power is the Duma of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. It consists of 15 deputies elected for a term of 5 years. As of 2016, it is represented by three factions: United Russia, LDPR, and CPRF.

===Governor===
The current governor of Chukotka is Vladislav Kuznetsov, who replaced Roman Kopin on 15 March 2023. Kuznetsov previously served as deputy prime minister of the unrecognized Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic.

The governor is elected by universal suffrage for a term of 5 years.

Roman Abramovich was governor of Chukotka from 2000 to 2008. Abramovich had spent over US$1 billion in the region (partly as normal tax payments) on developing infrastructure and providing direct aid to the inhabitants during his time as governor from 2000 until 2008. In 2004, there were also reports, however, that Chukotka gave Abramovich&#x27;s company Sibneft tax breaks in excess of US$450 million.

On 13 July 2008, the deputies of the Duma of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, during a secret ballot, unanimously approved Roman Kopin as governor, whose candidacy was submitted for consideration to the Duma of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug on 11 July 2008 by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in connection with the early resignation of Abramovich. On 8 September 2013, Kopin was elected governor.

On 15 March 2023, Vladislav Kuznetsov replaced Kopin as the governor of Chukotka.

==Administrative divisions==

Chukotka Autonomous Okrug is administratively divided into the following districts:

Along the Arctic coast (from west to east): Bilibinsky District (northwest), Chaunsky District around Chaunskaya Bay, then Iultinsky District, and finally Chukotsky District at the eastern cape.

Along the Pacific coast (from north to south): Providensky District south of Chukotsky, southern Iultinsky District around Kresta Bay, and finally eastern Anadyrsky District at the Anadyr Estuary.

Interior: The western quarter of the Okrug is Bilibinsky District, and the rest of the interior is Anadyrsky District.

==Demographics==
Population: 
The Chukotka Autonomous Okrug is one of the very few places in Russia where there are more men than women.

===Vital statistics===

===Life expectancy===

As of June 2022, Chukotka had the lowest life expectancy in Russia. This statistic varies greatly from year to year due to the region&#x27;s relatively small population.

===Ethnic groups===
According to the 2021 Census, the ethnic composition was:
*Russian 54.2%
*Chukchi 28.3%
*Ukrainian 3.2%
*Yupik 3.1%
*Even 2.7%
*Chuvan 1.6%
*Kalmyk 0.8%
*Tatar 0.7%
*Buryat 0.5%
*other groups of less than two hundred persons each

Historical figures are given below:

There are 86 recognized ethnic groups in the okrug as of 2021. Indigenous peoples make up 37% of the total population.

Ethnographic maps shows the Yupik peoples as the indigenous population of some villages near Provideniya, Chuvans in the Chuvanskoye village some west of Markovo, the Evens in some inland areas, and the Chukchi throughout the rest of the region.

===Religion===
The Russian Orthodox Church in Chukotka is represented by the Eparchy (Diocese) of Anadyr and Chukotka (). The controversial conservative Bishop of Anadyr and Chukotka, Diomid, who had occupied the Anadyr see since 2000 and had been instrumental in the development of the church in the peninsula, was removed by the Holy Synod in the summer of 2008. Diomid would later go on to establish a True Orthodox denomination in Chukotka, which has become largely inactive. Diomid was succeeded by Mark (Tuzhikov) as he was the acting Archbishop of Khabarovsk at the time.

The current Russian Orthodox bishop of Chukotka is Ipaty (Golubev) who was installed on 21 August 2018.

There is also a small evangelical presence in the city of Provideniya, founded by the Moldovan community there.
