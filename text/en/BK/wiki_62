<text>Calvary Chapel is an international association of charismatic evangelical churches, with origins in Pentecostalism. It maintains a number of radio stations around the world and operates many local Calvary Chapel Bible College programs.

Beginning in 1965 in Southern California, this fellowship of churches grew out of Chuck Smith&#x27;s Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa.

==History==

The association has its origins in the founding of a Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa (California) in 1965 by pastor Chuck Smith of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel with 25 people. In 1968 they broke away from Foursquare Church. Prior to Smith, Costa Mesa members spoke of their own vision of becoming part of a massive church movement.

In 1969 Calvary Chapel became a hub in what later became known as the Jesus movement when Smith&#x27;s daughter introduced him to her boyfriend John Higgins Jr., a former hippie who had become a Christian, and who went on to head the largest Jesus freak movement in history, the Shiloh Youth Revival Centers (1968–1989). John Higgins introduced Smith to Lonnie Frisbee, the &quot;hippie evangelist&quot; who became a key figure in the growth of both the Jesus Movement and Calvary Chapel. Frisbee moved into Smith&#x27;s home, and he would minister to other hippies and counter-culture youth on the beaches. At night he would bring home new converts, and soon Smith&#x27;s house was full. Frisbee became leader in a rental home for the steadily growing crowd of Christian hippies and he named the commune &quot;House of Miracles&quot;; other Houses of Miracles would develop throughout California and beyond. As Calvary Chapel grew &quot;explosively&quot;, a tent was erected during the construction of a new building.

The converts included musicians who began writing music for praise and worship. This became the genesis for Jesus music and Christian rock concerts. Maranatha! Music eventually formed to publish and promote the music. The services led by Frisbee usually resembled rock concerts more than any worship services of the time.
Frisbee featured in national television-news reports and magazines with images of him baptizing hundreds at a time in the Pacific Ocean. The network of House of Miracles communes/crash pads/coffee houses began doing outreach concerts with Smith or Frisbee preaching, Frisbee calling forth the Holy Spirit and the newly forming bands playing the music. By the early 1970s Calvary Chapel was home to ten or more musical groups that were representative of the Jesus people movement.

In 1982 John Wimber, a Calvary Chapel pastor, and the Calvary Chapel leadership mutually agreed to part ways. Tension had been mounting over Wimber&#x27;s emphasis on spiritual manifestations, leading Wimber to withdraw from Calvary Chapel and to affiliate with a network of churches that would become the Association of Vineyard Churches.

In 2012, Pastor Chuck Smith founded the Calvary Chapel Association (CCA) to unite all of the movement&#x27;s churches around the world.

On October 3, 2013, Pastor Smith died after a long battle with lung cancer. Smith remained as the senior pastor at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa during his battle with cancer; this included preaching at three services on the Sunday before his death.

== Statistics ==
According to a 2022 census of the association, it had 1,800 churches.

==Beliefs==
Chuck Smith&#x27;s &quot;Calvary Chapel Distinctives&quot; summarize the tenets for which Calvary Chapel stands. Calvary Chapels place great importance on the practice of expository teaching, a &quot;verse by verse, chapter by chapter, book by book&quot; approach to teaching the Bible.
Typically, Calvary Chapels operate under a senior pastor-led system of church government, also known as the &quot;Moses&quot; model.

It presents itself as a &quot;fellowship of churches&quot; rather than being a denomination.

Affiliates of Calvary Chapel believe in the doctrines of evangelical Christianity, which include the inerrancy of the Bible and the Trinity. Within evangelical Christianity, they say that they stand in the &quot;middle ground between fundamentalism and Pentecostalism in modern Protestant theology&quot;. While they share with a belief in the inerrancy of the Bible, they accept charismatic spiritual gifts. However, they feel that Pentecostalism values experience at the expense of the word of God.

===Calvinism and Arminianism===
According to Calvary Chapel literature, the association strives to &quot;strik[e] a balance between extremes&quot; when it comes to controversial theological issues such as Calvinism&#x27;s and Arminianism&#x27;s conflicting views on salvation. Calvary Chapels hold the following views on the five points of Calvinism:
# Regarding total depravity, Calvary Chapel affirms that &quot;apart from God&#x27;s grace, no one can be saved,&quot; and that &quot;mankind is clearly fallen and lost in sin.&quot;
# Regarding unconditional election, Calvary Chapel affirms that God, &quot;based on his foreknowledge, has predestined the believer,&quot; and that &quot;God clearly does choose, but man must also accept God&#x27;s invitation to salvation.&quot;
# Regarding limited atonement, Calvary Chapel affirms that Jesus died &quot;for the whole world&quot; and that the &quot;atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ was clearly sufficient to save the entire human race.&quot;
# Regarding irresistible grace, Calvary Chapel affirms that &quot;God&#x27;s grace can either be resisted or received by the exercise of human free will&quot;.
# Calvary Chapels &quot;believe in the perseverance of the saints (true believers) but are deeply concerned about sinful lifestyles and rebellious hearts among those who call themselves &#x27;Christians&#x27;.&quot;

===Spiritual gifts===
Although Calvary Chapel believes in the continuing efficacy of the gift of tongues, it does not recognize uninterpreted tongues spoken in a congregational setting as necessarily inspired (or at least directed) by the Holy Spirit because of its understanding of . Calvary Chapel accepts that the Bible affirms interpreted tongues and modern prophecy. Practicing tongues in private occurs more commonly. Calvary Chapel does not teach that the outward manifestation of every Christian counts as speaking in tongues.

Similar to other Pentecostal or Charismatic movements, Calvary Chapel holds that the baptism of the Holy Spirit does not take place during conversion, but is available as a second experience. It is their understanding that there are three distinct relationships with the Holy Spirit. The first is that which is experienced prior to conversion. In this relationship the Holy Spirit is convicting the person of his sin. In the second relationship the Holy Spirit indwells believers during conversion for the purpose of sanctification. The third relationship is the baptism of the Holy Spirit which Calvary Chapel believes is for the purpose of being a Christian witness.

===Baptism and Communion===
Calvary Chapels practice believer&#x27;s baptism by immersion. Calvary Chapel does not regard baptism as necessary for salvation, but instead sees it as an outward sign of an inward change. As a result, the Chapels do not baptize infants, although they may dedicate them to God. Calvary Chapel views Communion in a symbolic way, with reference to .

===Eschatology===
Calvary Chapels strongly espouse pretribulationist and premillennialist views in their eschatology (the study of the end times). They believe that the rapture of the Church will occur first, followed by a literal seven-year period of Great Tribulation, followed by the second coming of Jesus Christ, and then finally a literal thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ on Earth called the Millennial Kingdom. Calvary Chapel also rejects supersessionism, and instead believes that the Jews remain God&#x27;s chosen people and that Israel will play an important part in the end times.

Interest in one event during the Tribulation—the building of a Third Temple in Jerusalem—led in the early 1980s to associations between some in Calvary Chapel (including Chuck Smith) and Jewish groups interested in seeing the temple rebuilt.

===Return of Christ in 1981===
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Chuck Smith wrote and published a prophetic timeline that declared the imminent return of Christ.

In the book &quot;Snatched Away!&quot;, published in 1976, Smith wrote:

the generation that was living in May 1948 shall not pass until the second coming of Jesus Christ takes place and the kingdom of God be established upon the earth.

In a 1978 book, Smith wrote:

I believe that the generation of 1948 is the last generation. Since a generation of judgment is forty years and the Tribulation period lasts seven years, I believe the Lord could come back for His Church any time before the Tribulation starts, which would mean any time before 1981.

The reasoning had to do with the idea that the seven-year Tribulation would end in 1988, forty years after the establishment of the state of Israel. In his 1978 book, Smith reasoned that Halley&#x27;s Comet in 1986 would result in problems for those left behind:

The Lord said that towards the end of the Tribulation period the sun would scorch men who dwell upon the face of the Earth (Rev. 16). The year 1986 would fit just about right! We&#x27;re getting close to the Tribulation and the return of Christ in glory. All the pieces of the puzzle are coming together.

Disappointment resulting from the prophecy not materializing in 1981 caused some to leave the church.

==Practices==
Calvary Chapel pastors tend to prefer expositional sermons rather than topical ones, and they will often give their sermons sequentially from Genesis to Revelation in the Bible. They believe that expository preaching allows the congregation to learn how all parts of the Bible address issues as opposed to topical sermons which they see as allowing preachers to emphasize certain issues more than others. Another advantage, they say, is that it makes difficult topics easier to address because members of the congregation won&#x27;t feel like they are being singled out. It sees expository teaching as providing consistent teaching that, over time, brings the &quot;perfecting of the saints&quot; which is part of their general philosophy for the Church. In teaching expositorily through scripture sequentially, Calvary Chapel believes God sets the agenda, not the pastor.

Calvary Chapels believe that most churches have a &quot;dependent, highly organized, [and] structured&quot; environment, but that most people want an &quot;independent and casual way of life&quot;. Calvary churches typically have a casual and laid-back atmosphere. As a practical implication of this philosophy, people may wear informal clothes to church. Praise and worship usually consists of upbeat contemporary Christian music though many of the churches also sing hymns. The style of worship generally reflects the region and the specific make-up of the congregation.

Calvary Chapel does not have a formalized system of church membership. Calling a Calvary Chapel one&#x27;s church usually means regularly attending church services and becoming involved in fellowship with other &quot;members&quot; of the church.

==Organization==
The form of church government practiced by Calvary Chapel does not conform to any of the three historical forms. They do not employ congregational polity, believing that God&#x27;s people collectively made poor decisions in the Old Testament, citing as an example. They also criticize presbyterian polity because when &quot;the pastor is hired by the board and can be fired by the board,&quot; they fear that &quot;the pastor becomes a hireling&quot;. Although Calvary Chapel&#x27;s governance shares a similarity with episcopal polity in that the congregation has no direct authority over the pastor, it does not have the formal hierarchy characteristic of episcopal polity.

The majority of Calvary Chapels have adopted models of government based on their understanding of the theocracy that God established in the Old Testament they sometimes call the &quot;Moses model&quot;. In this system, God was head of his people and under God&#x27;s authority was Moses, who led the Israelites as God directed him. Moses also had a priesthood and seventy elders providing him support. Calvary Chapel has adapted this order believing their pastors have a role like Moses and their boards of elders function in supporting roles.

Calvary Chapels are independent and self-governing churches. They do not have church membership apart from pastors recognized through their affiliate program. The Calvary Chapel Association has the responsibility of affiliating churches with Calvary Chapel. A church that affiliates with Calvary Chapel often (but not always) uses the name &quot;Calvary Chapel&quot;. Three requirements for becoming affiliated exist:
# the pastor must &quot;embrace the characteristics of the Calvary Chapel movement as described in &quot;Calvary Chapel Distinctives&quot;&quot;
# the church must have the characteristics of a church (as opposed to a less-developed home fellowship)
# an applicant must express willingness to spend the time to fellowship with other Calvary Chapels

The requirements do not include a seminary degree. In accordance with Calvary&#x27;s interpretation and understanding of the Bible (see 1 Timothy 3:2 and 1 Timothy 3:12), Calvary Chapel does not ordain women or sexually-active homosexuals as pastors.

Regional lead pastors exercise a measure of accountability.
Since no legal or financial ties link the different Calvary Chapels, only disaffiliation can serve as a disciplinary procedure.

The Calvary Chapel trademark is owned by Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, the flagship church of the Calvary Chapel Global Network. The Calvary dove logo is also a &quot;trademark-protected property of Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa.&quot;

==Controversies==
Various criticisms of the organization and of the pastorate role in the organization exist. For example, Chuck Smith has been criticized for drawing connections between disasters (e.g., earthquakes, the September 11 attacks) and divine wrath against homosexuality and abortion.

Calvary Chapel leaders, including Smith, were the subject of a lawsuit alleging that they knew or should have known that a minister named Anthony Iglesias was prone to sexual abuse when they moved him from ministry positions in Diamond Bar, California, to Thailand, to Post Falls, Idaho. Iglesias was convicted of molesting two 14-year-old boys in California in 2004, and the lawsuit stemmed from events in Idaho, but all alleged abuse occurred in or before 2003. The church was dismissed as a defendant in the lawsuit.

As a result of what he saw as micromanaging church elders and board members, Chuck Smith used &quot;an independent board of elders&quot; when he took the senior pastor role at Calvary Chapel. Smith subsequently wrote that &quot;senior pastors should be answerable to God, not to a denominational hierarchy or board of elders&quot;. &quot;Christianity Today&quot; says that Smith&#x27;s &quot;Moses Model&quot;, in which senior pastors do not permit their authority to be challenged, can lead to churches that are often resistant to accountability. In response, Smith says he is following the authority structure that God used when Israel was under the rule of Moses.

According to one article, &quot;Smith&#x27;s book &quot;Calvary Chapel Distinctives&quot; teaches that senior pastors should be answerable to God, not to a denominational hierarchy or board of elders.&quot; Critics say this &#x27;Moses model&#x27; produces pastors who do not permit their authority to be challenged. Calvary Chapel suggests that some churches are led astray by the management of their boards and that a biblical board of elders should aid the ministry and give wise counsel, not control the affairs of the church.

In November 2016, Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa left the Calvary Chapel Association and formed the Calvary Chapel Global Network. The latter continues to count the association&#x27;s 1,700 churches as members unless they opt out.

==Ministries==

===Bible college===

Calvary Chapel Bible College (CCBC) in Twin Peaks, California is the flagship of at least 50 affiliated campuses throughout the world. The college recently returned to a newly renovated site after about three decades in Murrieta, California. Founded in 1975, it originally offered a &quot;short, intensive study program&quot;, but became a college awarding Certificates of Completion, Associate in Theology degrees (for high-school graduates), and Bachelor of Biblical Studies degrees (to students who have an Associate of Arts from an approved college). The college as a whole is pursuing accreditation; and students can transfer CCBC credits to some major accredited colleges such as Azusa Pacific, Biola University, Liberty University, Veritas International University, etc. The college was initially reluctant on seeking accreditation,
stating that this allows Calvary Chapel Bible College to keep tuition costs lower and offer courses taught by instructors without master&#x27;s degrees. But C.C.B.C. has reversed course and is currently seeking accreditation.

===Harvest Crusades===

Harvest Crusades operate as a ministry of Harvest Christian Fellowship (a former Calvary Chapel in Riverside, California). They carry out an evangelistic ministry similar to Billy Graham&#x27;s. They meet in stadiums and have Christian music bands play followed by an evangelical message normally given by Greg Laurie. They estimate three million people have attended since its inception in 1990.

In addition, a Calvary Chapel in Twin Falls, Idaho founded the CSN International (originally known as the &quot;Calvary Satellite Network&quot;) and Effect Radio networks; though CSN still carries a significant number of programs from several Calvary Chapels, the networks and the church (subsequently known by the name &quot;The River Christian Fellowship&quot;) severed their official ties with the Calvary Chapel as part of a 2007 legal settlement. In 2010, Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa sold 11 stations and 20 translators in the midwestern United States to the Calvary Radio Network.

<text>Central Saint Martins is a constituent college of the University of the Arts London, a public art university in London, England. The college offers full-time courses at foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and a variety of short and summer courses.

It was formerly known as Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, and before that as Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design.

==History==
Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design was formed in 1989 from the merger of the Central School of Art and Design, founded in 1896, and Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art, founded in 1854. Since 1986 both schools had been part of the London Institute, formed by the Inner London Education Authority to bring together seven London art, design, fashion and media schools. The London Institute became a legal entity in 1988, could award taught degrees from 1993, was granted university status in 2003 and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004. It also includes Camberwell College of Arts, Chelsea College of Arts, the London College of Communication, the London College of Fashion and Wimbledon College of Arts.

The Drama Centre London, founded in 1963, joined Central Saint Martins in 1999 as an integral school, maintaining its name and teaching approaches. The Byam Shaw School of Art, founded in 1910, was merged into Central Saint Martins in 2003.

===Central School of Art and Design===
The Central School of Art and Design was established as the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896 by London County Council. It grew directly from the Arts and Crafts movement of William Morris and John Ruskin. The first principal, from 1896 until 1911, was William Richard Lethaby; a blue plaque in his memory was erected in 1957. The school was at first housed in Morley Hall, rented from the Regent Street Polytechnic. It moved to purpose-built premises in Southampton Row, in the London Borough of Camden, in 1908. In the same year the Royal Female School of Art, established in 1842, was merged into the school. Central became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Saint Martin&#x27;s in 1989.

===Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art===

Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art was established in 1854 by Henry Mackenzie, vicar of the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. It became independent from the church in 1859. Frank Martin became head of the sculpture department in 1952; he brought in young sculptors and recent graduates of the department as teachers. Among these, Anthony Caro was particularly influential. The group around him came to be known as the New Generation of British sculptors and the sculpture department of Saint Martin&#x27;s became, in the words of Tim Scott: &quot;the most famous in the art world&quot;. Saint Martin&#x27;s became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Central in 1989.

===Drama Centre London===

The Drama Centre London was founded in 1963 by a breakaway group of teachers and students from the Central School of Speech and Drama, led by John Blatchley, Yat Malmgren and Christopher Fettes. The school was a member of Drama UK and its undergraduate acting course was accredited by Drama UK. The Drama Centre London merged with Central Saint Martins in 1999. The University of the Arts London decided in 2020 to close it.

===Byam Shaw School of Art===
Byam Shaw School of Art was founded by the artists John Byam Shaw and Rex Vicat Cole in 1910 as a school of drawing and painting. It was originally located in Campden Street, Kensington, and moved to larger premises in Archway in 1990. It was subsumed by Central Saint Martins in 2003.

==Awards and assessment==
In 1998 the London Institute received a Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for the &quot;massive contribution&quot; of Central Saint Martins College of Art &amp; Design to the growth of the fashion industry in Britain. The University of the Arts London received a Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize in 2013, for the contribution of CSM industrial and product design graduates to commerce, industry and the design profession.

CSM does not receive independent assessment in the &quot;Complete University Guide&quot; league tables, but is ranked as part of the University of the Arts London. In 2014 the university received an overall ranking of 67 out of 124 institutions, with a rank of 102 for graduate prospects and 123 for student satisfaction with teaching. In 2018 it was placed 83rd out of 129 universities, with a rank of 125 for student satisfaction.

== Schools and location ==

Teaching at Central Saint Martins is organised into nine programmes, which include acting, art, design, fashion, graphics and jewellery and textiles, as well as foundation courses.

Central Saint Martins moved to a converted warehouse complex on Granary Square at King&#x27;s Cross in 2011. Most of the college is housed there, but it also uses the former Byam Shaw building in Elthorne Road, Archway, and premises in Richbell Place, Holborn.

==Staff and alumni==

Among the alumni of the school are the Turner Prize winner Laure Prouvost, the musician Jarvis Cocker, and many fashion designers, including John Galliano, Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen, Zac Posen and Riccardo Tisci.

In 2022 Rathna Ramanathan became head of the college, succeeding Jeremy Till who had been in the post since 2012.

<text>ISO/IEC 11404, General Purpose Datatypes (GPD), are a collection of datatypes defined independently of any particular programming language or implementation. These datatypes can be used to describe interfaces to existing libraries without having to specify the language (such as Fortran or C). 

The first edition of this standard was published in 1996 under the title &quot;Language-independent datatypes&quot;. The standard was revised by the responsible ISO sub-committee (JTC1/SC22 - Information Technology - Programming languages).

<doc id="385290" wikidata="Q4914" url="?curid=385290" title="Jimmy Kimmel">
<text>James Christian Kimmel (born November 13, 1967) is an American actor, television host, comedian, writer, producer. He has been the host and executive producer of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, a late-night talk show, since 2003. Kimmel has hosted the Primetime Emmy Awards three times, in 2012, 2016 and 2020, and the Academy Awards four times, in 2017, 2018, 2023, and 2024.

Before hosting &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Kimmel was the co-host of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Man Show&quot; and &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot;. Kimmel has also produced several TV shows, including &quot;Crank Yankers&quot;, &quot;Sports Show with Norm Macdonald&quot;, and &quot;The Andy Milonakis Show&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Time&quot; named him as one of &quot;The World&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People&quot;. Kimmel has hosted a late-night talk show the longest of all current late-night television hosts in the United States, after Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s retirement from hosting a late-night program.

== Early life and family ==
Kimmel was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and grew up in the neighborhood of Mill Basin. He is the eldest of the three children of Joan (née Iacono) and James John Kimmel, who worked at American Express and was an IBM executive.

He was raised Catholic and as a child, was an altar boy. Kimmel&#x27;s mother is of Italian descent; her grandparents migrated to the United States from Ischia, Naples after the 1883 earthquake. Two of his paternal great-great-grandparents were German immigrants. His family&#x27;s surname was &quot;Kümmel&quot; (&quot;caraway&quot; in German) several generations back. According to a DNA test, Kimmel is also of partial Albanian descent.

The family moved to Las Vegas when he was nine years old. He graduated from Ed W. Clark High School and attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, for one year before transferring to Arizona State University. He received an honorary degree from UNLV in 2013.

Kimmel&#x27;s uncle, Frank Potenza (&quot;Uncle Frank&quot;), appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; as a regular from 2003 until his death in 2011. His cousin Sal Iacono performed Kimmel&#x27;s former co-hosting duties during the last season of &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot; and then became a writer and sketch performer on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; His Aunt Chippy (Concetta Potenza) is also a featured part of the show. His brother Jonathan works on the show as a director. His sister, Jill, is a comedian.

== Career ==

=== Radio career ===

Inspired by David Letterman&#x27;s start in radio, Kimmel began working in radio while in high school. He was the host of a Sunday night interview show on UNLV&#x27;s college station, KUNV. While attending Arizona State University, he became a popular caller to the KZZP-FM afternoon show hosted by radio personalities Mike Elliott and Kent Voss in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1989, Kimmel landed his first paying job alongside Voss as morning drive co-host of &quot;The Me and Him Show&quot; at KZOK-FM in Seattle, Washington. Over the next 10 months, the hosts performed several stunts on air, including one that led to an $8,000 loss in advertising.

In 1990, Kimmel and Voss were fired by KZOK and were fired again a year later at WRBQ-FM in Tampa. Kimmel went on to host his own show at KCMJ in Palm Springs, California, where he recruited as his intern Carson Daly, who had been a family friend since his childhood. After a morning stint at KRQQ in Tucson, Arizona, Kimmel landed at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. He spent five years as &quot;Jimmy The Sports Guy&quot; for the Kevin and Bean morning show. During that time he met and befriended the comedian Adam Carolla.

=== Comedy Central ===

Kimmel initially did not want to do television; he began writing for Fox announcers and promotions and was quickly recruited to do the on-air promotions himself. He declined several offers for television shows from producer Michael Davies, being uninterested in the projects, until he was offered a place as the comedic counterpart to Ben Stein on the game show &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot;, which began airing on Comedy Central in 1997. His quick wit and &quot;everyman&quot; personality were counterpoints to Stein&#x27;s monotonous vocal style and faux-patrician demeanor. The combination earned the pair an Emmy award for Best Game Show Host.

In 1999, during his time on &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot;, Kimmel co-hosted (with Adam Carolla) and co-produced (with Daniel Kellison), Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Man Show&quot;. Kimmel left &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot; in 2001 and was replaced by comedian Nancy Pimental, who was eventually replaced by Kimmel&#x27;s cousin Sal Iacono. &quot;The Man Show&quot;″s success allowed Kimmel, Carolla, and Kellison to create and produce, under the banner Jackhole Productions, &quot;Crank Yankers&quot; for Comedy Central (on which Kimmel plays the characters &quot;Elmer Higgins&quot;, &quot;Terrence Catheter&quot;, &quot;The Nudge&quot;, &quot;Karl Malone&quot; and himself) and later &quot;The Andy Milonakis Show&quot; for MTV2. Kimmel also produced and co-wrote the feature film &quot;Windy City Heat&quot;, Festival Prize winner of the Comedia Award for Best Film at the 2004 Montreal Comedy Festival.

=== &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; ===
In January 2003, Kimmel permanently left &quot;The Man Show&quot; to host his own late-night talk show, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, on ABC. In April 2007, Stuffmagazine.com named Kimmel the &quot;biggest badass on TV.&quot; Kimmel said it was an honor but clearly a mistake.

Despite its name, the show has not actually aired live since 2004, when censors were unable to properly bleep censor a barrage of swearing from actor Thomas Jane.

During the 2004 NBA Finals in Detroit, Kimmel appeared on ABC&#x27;s halftime show to make an on-air plug for his show. He suggested that if the Detroit Pistons defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, &quot;they&#x27;re gonna burn the city of Detroit down ... and it&#x27;s not worth it.&quot; Officials with Detroit&#x27;s ABC affiliate, WXYZ-TV, immediately announced that that night&#x27;s show would not air on the station. Hours later, ABC officials pulled that night&#x27;s show from the entire network. Kimmel later apologized.

Kimmel usually ends his show with &quot;My apologies to Matt Damon, we ran out of time.&quot; When Matt Damon did actually appear on the show to be interviewed, he walked in and sat down only to be told just a few seconds later by Kimmel, &quot;Unfortunately, we are totally out of time,&quot; followed by &quot;my apologies to Matt Damon.&quot; Damon appeared angry but both performers have since indicated that their faux-feud is a joke.

In February 2008, Kimmel showed a mock music video with a panoply of stars called &quot;I&#x27;m Fucking Ben Affleck&quot;, as &quot;revenge&quot; after his then-girlfriend Sarah Silverman and Damon recorded a similar video titled &quot;I&#x27;m Fucking Matt Damon&quot;. Silverman&#x27;s video originally aired on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and became an &quot;instant YouTube sensation&quot;. Kimmel&#x27;s &quot;revenge&quot; video featured himself, Ben Affleck, and a large lineup of stars, particularly in scenes spoofing the 1985 &quot;We Are the World&quot; video: Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, Cameron Diaz, Robin Williams, Harrison Ford, Dominic Monaghan, Benji Madden and Joel Madden from Good Charlotte, Lance Bass, Macy Gray, Josh Groban, Huey Lewis, Perry Farrell, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Pete Wentz, Meat Loaf, Rebecca Romijn, Christina Applegate, Dom Joly, Mike Shinoda, Lauren Conrad, and Joan Jett, among others.

After this, Kimmel&#x27;s sidekick, Guillermo, appeared in a spoof of &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;, which starred Damon. He was then chased down by Damon, who was cursing about Kimmel being behind all this. Guillermo also stopped Damon on the red carpet one time and, before he could finish the interview, said, &quot;Sorry, we are out of time.&quot; The most recent encounter was titled &quot;The Handsome Men&#x27;s Club&quot; which featured Kimmel, along with the &quot;Handsome Men&quot;, who were: Matthew McConaughey, Rob Lowe, Lenny Kravitz, Patrick Dempsey, Sting, Keith Urban, John Krasinski, Ethan Hawke, Josh Hartnett, Tony Romo, Ted Danson, Taye Diggs, Gilles Marini, and Ben Affleck speaking about being handsome and all the jobs that come with it. At the end of the skit, Kimmel has a door slammed in his face by Damon, who says they have run out of time and laughs sinisterly. Jennifer Garner also makes a surprise appearance. As a tradition, celebrities voted off &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; appear on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, causing Kimmel to describe himself as &quot;the three-headed dog the stars must pass on their way to No-Dancing Hell.&quot;

In October 2013, a new segment of the show, &quot;Kids Table&quot;, showcased five- and six-year-olds discussing the U.S. government shutdown and U.S. debts. When one of the children suggested &quot;killing all the people in China&quot; as a way of resolving the U.S. debt, Kimmel responded that that was &quot;an interesting idea&quot; and soon jokingly asked a followup: &quot;Should we allow the Chinese to live?&quot; The incident triggered discussions and protests on the internet, even from Mainland China. In an October 25 letter to a group called the 80-20 Initiative, which identifies itself as a pan-Asian-American political organization, ABC apologized for the segment, saying &quot;We would never purposefully broadcast anything to upset the Chinese community, Asian community, anyone of Chinese descent or any community at large.&quot; More than a hundred people took to the streets in San Francisco on October 28 to protest the show and demand &quot;a more elaborate apology&quot; and that Kimmel be fired. On that day&#x27;s broadcast, Kimmel addressed the controversy personally, saying: &quot;I thought it was obvious that I didn&#x27;t agree with that statement, but apparently it wasn&#x27;t ... So I just wanted to say, I&#x27;m sorry, I apologize.&quot; Despite the apologies from ABC and Kimmel, protests continued. A White House petition was created to investigate the incident and reached the 100,000 signatures needed to require a response from the White House. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus denounced the incident and demanded a formal apology from ABC.

During a November 2022 appearance on Stitcher&#x27;s &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; podcast, Kimmel revealed he told ABC executives, soon after the 2016 election of Donald Trump, that if he could not tell Trump jokes, then he would leave the show. It appears the execs once spoke to Kimmel about laying off Trump in order to not alienate Republican viewers. Kimmel said ABC execs were right in their apprehension, as he estimates he lost around half of his audience due to Trump jokes.

=== Other television work ===

In spring 1996, Kimmel appeared as &quot;Jimmy the Fox Guy&quot; in promos on the Fox Network. His other television work included being the on-air football prognosticator for &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; for four years. He has had numerous appearances on other talk shows, including &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

He has appeared on &quot;The Late Show&quot; five times, most recently in 2010. Kimmel served as roastmaster for the New York Friars&#x27; Club Roast of Hugh Hefner and the Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson. He has appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

In August 2006, ABC announced that Kimmel would be host of their new game show &quot;Set for Life&quot;. The show debuted on July 20, 2007. On April 6, 2007, Kimmel filled in for Larry King on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. That particular broadcast dealt with paparazzi. Kimmel reproached Emily Gould, an editor at Gawker.com, for the site&#x27;s alleged stalking of celebrities. On July 8, 2007, Kimmel managed the National League in the 2007 Taco Bell All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game in San Francisco. He played in the game in 2004 and 2006 (in Houston and Pittsburgh, respectively). On July 11, 2007, Kimmel, along with basketball player LeBron James, hosted the 2007 &quot;ESPY Awards&quot;. The show aired on ESPN on July 15, 2007. Kimmel hosted the American Music Awards on ABC five times, in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008.

Kimmel guest-hosted &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; during the week of October 22–26, 2007, commuting every day between New York and Los Angeles. In the process, he broke the Guinness World Record for the longest distance () traveled in one work week. Kimmel himself has questioned the record, suggesting that a world leader or the Pope must actually hold the record.

Kimmel has performed in several animated films, often voicing dogs. His voice appeared in &quot;&quot; and &quot;Road Trip&quot;, and he portrayed Death&#x27;s Dog in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Saturday Knight&quot;; &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane later presented Kimmel with a figurine of his character on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; Kimmel also did voice work for &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. Kimmel&#x27;s cousin Sal Iacono has accepted and won a wrestling match with Santino Marella.

On January 14, 2010, amid the 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host and time slot conflict, Kimmel was the special guest of Jay Leno on &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;″s &quot;10 at 10&quot; segment. Kimmel derided Leno in front of a live studio audience for taking back the 11:35 pm time slot from Conan O&#x27;Brien, and repeatedly insulted Leno. He ended the segment with a plea that Leno &quot;leave our shows alone&quot;, as Kimmel and O&#x27;Brien had &quot;kids&quot; while Leno only had &quot;cars&quot;.

Kimmel hosted the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 23, 2012, and the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 18, 2016. With the presidential election only weeks away, Kimmel pointed out the role Mark Burnett played in the rise of Trump.

Kimmel hosted the 89th edition of the Academy Awards ceremony on February 26, 2017. He returned as host for the 90th edition on March 4, 2018, and the 95th edition on March 12, 2023. He returned for the fourth time to host the 96th edition on March 10, 2024.

In June 2018, Kimmel was challenged by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz to a one-on-one basketball game after Kimmel compared Cruz&#x27;s appearance to that of a blobfish. Kimmel accepted and the game (known as the Blobfish Basketball Classic) was scheduled to take place at Texas Southern University on June 16, with the loser donating $5,000 to the non-political charity of the winner&#x27;s choice. Cruz defeated Kimmel 11–9, and over $80,000 was raised from the game and donated to the charities.

In November 2018, Kimmel launched his second production company, Kimmelot.

Kimmel was the host and co-executive producer of a celebrity edition of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, which premiered for the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2020. It premiered on April 8, 2020, on ABC. In June 2020, it was announced that Kimmel would return to host the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards on September 20, 2020.

=== Books ===
In July 2019, Kimmel released his first book, &quot;The Serious Goose&quot;, an interactive children&#x27;s picture book featuring his own illustrations that tasks readers with helping to make the serious goose smile.

=== Podcasts ===
On August 30, 2023, Kimmel began hosting the comedy podcast &quot;Strike Force Five&quot; with Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert, and John Oliver to support their staff members out of work due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.

== Influences ==
Kimmel&#x27;s biggest influences in comedy are David Letterman and Howard Stern. Kimmel has said of Letterman, &quot;His show was just so weird and different. I&#x27;d never seen anything like it. I didn&#x27;t know anyone who had a sense of humor like that.&quot; Kimmel has often joked that the only reason he got into show business was to be friends with Letterman; he has also questioned why anybody would watch his show instead of Letterman&#x27;s.

Kimmel wrote a piece for &quot;Time&quot; about his love for Letterman, saying:

== Personal life ==

Kimmel is a practicing Catholic. He has spoken publicly about having narcolepsy.

Kimmel married Gina Maddy in 1988; they divorced in 2002. Their daughter Katherine was born in 1991 and their son Kevin was born in 1993. He had a relationship with comedian Sarah Silverman from 2002 to March 2009.

Kimmel started dating Molly McNearney, a co-head writer for &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot;, in October 2009. They were engaged in August 2012 and married in July 2013. Their daughter Jane was born in July 2014, they are both living in Hermosa Beach, California.

Their second child, William &quot;Billy&quot; John, was born on April 21, 2017. He was born with a rare congenital heart defect, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with pulmonary atresia, which was first detected when he had a purplish appearance at three hours after birth. He underwent successful surgery at three days of age. The first guests Kimmel had when his show returned following his son&#x27;s birth were cardiac surgeon Mehmet Oz, who explained the condition, and snowboarder Shaun White, who was born with TOF. Kimmel later cited his son&#x27;s condition in a monologue criticizing a previous guest, Senator Bill Cassidy, who had co-authored a congressional healthcare bill, for not living up to the &quot;Jimmy Kimmel test&quot; regarding access for patients with preexisting conditions. The monologue was widely discussed as part of the wider debate about the American healthcare system.

In 2020, Kimmel learned that he and Martha Stewart are cousins through a genealogy report on the TV show &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;.

=== Interests ===
Kimmel plays the bass clarinet, and was a guest performer at a concert in Costa Mesa, California, on July 20, 2008, featuring The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, performing with the group on the song &quot;The Impression That I Get&quot;.

Kimmel co-founded the annual Los Angeles Feast of San Gennaro, a New York City annual tradition, and co-hosted the eighth annual Los Angeles version in 2009.

In 2018, he fundraised for Nevada U.S. Senate candidate (and eventual Senator) Jacky Rosen.

In 2021, Kimmel became the title sponsor of the LA Bowl for that year; in 2022, a college football bowl game was to be played annually in Los Angeles at Inglewood&#x27;s SoFi Stadium. The game became officially known as the Jimmy Kimmel LA Bowl.

<text>ORP &quot;Błyskawica&quot; (Polish for Lightning) is a which served in the Polish Navy during World War II. She is the only Polish Navy ship to have been decorated with the &quot;Virtuti Militari&quot;, Poland&#x27;s highest military order for gallantry, and in 2012 was given the Pro Memoria Medal. &quot;Błyskawica&quot; is preserved as a museum ship in Gdynia and is the oldest preserved destroyer in the world. &quot;Błyskawica&quot; is moored next to the &quot;Dar Pomorza&quot;.

She was the second of the two &quot;Grom&quot; (Thunderbolt)-class destroyers built for the Polish Navy by J. Samuel White, of Cowes, in 1935–37. The &quot;Grom&quot; class were two of the most heavily armed and fastest destroyers in World War II.

==Construction and design==
In 1934 the British shipbuilder J. Samuel White won a competition to design and build large destroyers for the Polish Navy, beating a proposal from fellow British shipbuilder Swan Hunter. (A design by the French shipyard Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire had been rejected in 1933). An order for two destroyers of the &quot;Grom&quot; class was placed on 29 March 1935.

At the turn of the 1920s and 1930s, the Naval Directorate (KMW) made efforts to acquire other destroyers after the &quot;Wicher&quot; and &quot;Burza&quot;. The 1932 Danzig crisis led to a navalist turn in Poland, and Poland&#x27;s de facto leader, Marshal Józef Piłsudski, became more willing to allocate funds for the navy. On November 24, 1932, the head of the KMW Rear Admiral Jerzy Świrski obtained, after a personal conversation with Marshal Piłsudski, his oral consent to expand the existing fleet. As a result, in May 1933, a tender for the supply of two destroyers was issued among the French shipyards, and after its fiasco, the next in January 1934 among the Swedish shipyards, also failed in disagreement. During this time, tactical and technical assumptions for the planned ships crystallized, including, among others, the use of 120 mm Bofors guns as their primary armament.

When they were built, the &quot;Grom&quot;s were amongst the fastest and most heavily armed destroyers to be built. &quot;Błyskawica&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Three 3-drum boilers fed steam to two sets of geared steam turbines which were rated at , driving two propeller shafts to give a design speed of . Main gun armament consisted of seven 120 mm (4.7 in) guns (50 calibre M34/36 guns supplied by Bofors of Sweden) in three twin and one single mounts, with an anti-aircraft armament of two twin Bofors 40 mm guns and eight 13.2 mm machine guns. Six torpedo tubes were carried, compatible with the French torpedoes used by the preceding s. Anti-submarine armament consisted of two depth charge chutes with 40 depth charges, while rails were fitted to permit up to 44 mines to be carried. The ship&#x27;s complement consisted of 180 officers and men.

&quot;Błyskawica&quot;, the second of the two destroyers, was laid down on 1 October 1935 at J. Samuel White&#x27;s Cowes, Isle of Wight shipyard, and was launched on 1 October 1936. Sea trials were successful, with the ship exceeding the design speed of 39 knots. &quot;Błyskawica&quot; was commissioned on 1 October 1937.

===Modifications===
When &quot;Błyskawica&quot; and arrived in the United Kingdom in September 1939, it was found that the ships, designed for operations in the sheltered Baltic, were top-heavy for operations in the rougher North Atlantic, so the ships were modified to reduce the centre of gravity. A searchlight tower on top of the ship&#x27;s bridge was removed, as was a deck house aft carrying a second searchlight, and the distinctive funnel cap. In addition, the aft set of torpedo tubes was removed to allow fitting of a anti-aircraft gun. In December 1941, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; was rearmed, with the 120 mm guns for which ammunition was not available replaced by four twin Mk XVI dual-purpose guns. The 13.2 mm machine guns were replaced by four Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and the second set of torpedo tubes were reinstated.

==Operational history==

Two days before the war, on 30 August 1939, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; withdrew, along with the destroyers and , from the Baltic Sea to Britain in accordance with the Peking Plan to avoid open conflict with Germany and possible destruction. The three destroyers were sighted by German warships, including the cruiser on 30 and 31 August, but hostilities had not yet started, and the Polish destroyers passed by unhindered, reaching Leith in Scotland at 17:30 on 1 September 1939. From then on they acted in tandem with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Home Fleet. On 7 September 1939, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; made contact with and attacked an U-boat.

In early May 1940, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; took part in the Norwegian Campaign, shelling German positions and downing two Luftwaffe aircraft. Her sister ship &quot;Grom&quot; was bombed and sunk during the campaign. Later that month, she took part in covering Operation Dynamo, the successful British led evacuation from Dunkirk.

During the rest of the war, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; took part in convoy and patrol duties, engaging both U-boats and the Luftwaffe in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. On 1 September 1940, for example, she rescued the sole survivor from the torpedoed merchant ship . In 1941 her 120 mm guns were replaced with British dual-purpose guns. The ship was also given escort duties for troop transports, notably , being one of the few ships that could keep up with the liner.

On the night of 4–5 May 1942, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; helped to defend the Isle of Wight town of East Cowes from an air raid by 160 German bombers. The ship was undergoing an emergency refit at the J. Samuel White yard where she had been built and, on the night of the raid, fired repeated rounds at the German bombers from outside the harbour; her guns became so hot they had to be doused with water from the River Medina to keep them from overheating. Extra ammunition had to be ferried over from Portsmouth. The intervention of &quot;Błyskawica&quot; forced the bombers to stay high, making it difficult for them to target properly. The ship also laid down a smokescreen hiding Cowes from sight, further compounding the difficulty the bomber crews faced in targeting it. The town and the shipyard were badly damaged, but it is generally considered that without this defensive action, it would have been far worse. In 2002 the crew&#x27;s courage was honoured by a local commemoration lasting several days to mark the 60th anniversary of the event. In 2004 an area of Cowes was named Francki Place in honour of the ship&#x27;s commander. The Isle of Wight Council approved the idea of having &quot;Błyskawica&quot; return to Cowes in 2012 to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the event and the 75th anniversary of the ship&#x27;s commissioning. There were large celebrations commemorating the 70th anniversary of Cowes&#x27;s defence in 2012 lasting several days and attended by Polish warship . Another large event to commemorate &quot;Błyskawica&quot;&#x27;s 75th anniversary was organised by Friends of the ORP Błyskawica Society in May 2017, the Polish Navy minelayer arrived at the port to take part in the celebrations.

In March 1943 &quot;Błyskawica&quot; replaced , which was sunk by E-boats on 12 March 1943, in Cruiser Force Q based at Bône, North Africa. In January 1944, the &quot;Błyskawica&quot; was assigned to the Anglo-Polish-Canadian 10th Destroyer Flotilla that battled the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; for the control of the English Channel. The Canadian sailors could not pronounce the name of the &quot;Błyskawica&quot; correctly and always called her the &quot;bottle of whiskey&quot;. On 8 June 1944, the &quot;Błyskawica&quot; took part in the Battle of Ushant against &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; destroyers.

During the war, she logged and escorted 83 convoys. In combat, she damaged three U-boats, helped sink other ships, and shot down at least four aircraft. In late 1945 and early 1946 &quot;Błyskawica&quot;, along with the destroyer , took part in Operation Deadlight, the scuttling of over 100 German U-boats.

In the spring of 1947, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; was transferred to the new Polish government, but it was not until 1 July 1947 that she sailed out of Rosyth under the Polish People&#x27;s Navy flag. A few days later on July 4, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; docked in Gdynia.

In the first few years of its return to Poland, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; was used as a training ship and cruised with officer cadets on board. In 1951 &quot;Błyskawica&quot; visited Leningrad.

In 1951-52 &quot;Błyskawica&quot; was modernized. The ship&#x27;s British 4-inch gun barrels were replaced by Soviet B-34 100 mm gun barrels in the same mountings to allow Soviet ammunition to be used, while Soviet 37 mm AA guns in four twin and two single mountings replaced the old 40 mm and 20 mm mountings. A single Soviet triple 533.4 mm torpedo tube mount replaced the British mount. Soviet radar was added, including a Soviet copy of the British type 291 radar set.

In September 1955, ORP &quot;Błyskawica&quot; along with ORP &quot;Burza&quot; paid a courtesy visit to Portsmouth, England. In July 1957, &quot;Błyskawica&quot;, along with two Kronshtadt-class submarine chasers visited Stockholm, Sweden. During this visit, two Polish sailors jumped ship and asked for political asylum in Sweden.

&quot;Błyskawica&quot; underwent a second modernization in late 1957–1960 to address issues with her propulsion system as well as radio and electronic equipment and updated radar. At the same time, her Soviet B-34 100 mm main guns were replaced with upgraded B-34 U 100mm guns.

ORP &quot;Błyskawica&quot; continued to make courtesy visits to foreign ports in the decade of the 60s. She made a visit to Helsinki, Finland in 1961, followed by a visit to Greenwich, England in 1962. In September 1963, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; made a port call to Copenhagen, Denmark. The ship also visited Chatham, England in 1964 and Narvik, Norway in 1965.

On August 9, 1967, destroyer &quot;Błyskawica&quot; had a tragic accident at sea while on an exercise. A high-pressure steam pipe ruptured in one of her boiler rooms, killing seven sailors. After this accident, &quot;Błyskawica&quot; remained immobilized and it was decided she would not undergo repairs. Instead, she was reclassified as an anti-aircraft defence ship for the port of Świnoujście in June 1969.

In May 1976 she became a museum ship, part of the Naval Museum in Gdynia – replacing the other WW2 veteran, the ageing ORP &quot;Burza&quot;.

In July 2006 the preserved Canadian destroyer was &quot;twinned&quot; with &quot;Błyskawica&quot; in a ceremony in Gdynia, Poland. Both ships served in the 10th Destroyer Flotilla during the Second World War. The ceremony was attended by former crew members of both ships and the general public. The ship was visited in 2009 by Prince Charles, Prince of Wales (now King Charles III), and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall (now Queen Camilla), and on 29 June 2010, at Government House in Nova Scotia, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, presented to representatives of HMCS &quot;Haida&quot; the World Ship Trust Certificate.

<text>Vicente García-Huidobro Fernández (; January 10, 1893 – January 2, 1948) was a Chilean poet born to an aristocratic family. He promoted the avant-garde literary movement in Chile and was the creator and greatest exponent of the literary movement called &quot;Creacionismo&quot; (&quot;Creationism&quot;).

==Life and work==

===Early years===

Huidobro was born into a wealthy family from Santiago, Chile. He spent his first years in Europe, and was educated by French and English governesses. Once his family was back in Chile, Vicente was enrolled at the Colegio San Ignacio, a Jesuit secondary school in Santiago, where he was expelled for wearing a ring that he claimed was a wedding ring.

In 1910 he studied literature at the Instituto Pedagogico of the University of Chile, but a good part of his knowledge of literature and poetry came from his mother, poet María Luisa Fernández Bascuñán. She used to host &quot;tertulias&quot; or salons in the family home, where sometimes up to 60 people came to talk and to listen to her talk about literature, with guests including members of the family, servants, maids and a dwarf. Later, in 1912, she would help him financially and emotionally to publish his first magazine &quot;Musa Joven&quot; (Young Muse).

In 1911 he published &quot;Ecos del alma&quot; (&quot;Echoes of the Soul&quot;), a work with modernist tones. The following year he married Manuela Portales Bello. In 1913 he published &quot;Canciones en la noche&quot; (&quot;Songs in the Night&quot;). The book included some poems previously published in &quot;Musa Joven&quot; as well as his first calligram, &quot;Triángulo armónico&quot; (&quot;Harmonic Triangle&quot;).

In 1913, along with Carlos Díaz Loyola (better known as Pablo de Rokha), he published three issues of the magazine &quot;Azul&quot; (Blue), and published both &quot;Canciones en la noche&quot; and &quot;La gruta del silencio&quot; (&quot;The Grotto of Silence&quot;). The next year, he gave a lecture, &quot;Non serviam&quot;, in which he reflected on his aesthetic vision. The same year, in &quot;Pasando y Pasando&quot; (“Passing and Passing”), Vicente explained his religious doubts, earning himself the reproach of both his family and the Jesuits.

The same year, he published &quot;Las pagodas ocultas&quot; (1916), and signed it for the first time as Vicente Huidobro.

===Move abroad===

In 1916, he traveled to Buenos Aires with Teresa Wilms Montt, a young poet whom he had rescued from a convent. While in Buenos Aires, Huidobro outlined his creationism literary theory, later a literary movement, and published &quot;El espejo de agua&quot; (The Mirror of Water).

Also in 1916, he moved to Europe with his wife and children. While passing through Madrid, he met Rafael Cansino Assens, with whom he had exchanged letters since 1914.

He settled in Paris and published &quot;Adán&quot; (1916), a work that began his next phase of artistic development. Huidobro met and mixed with most of the Parisian avant garde of this period: Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Jacques Lipchitz, Francis Picabia, Joan Miró, Max Ernst, Paul Éluard, Amedeo Modigliani and Blaise Cendrars.

In 1917, he contributed to the magazine Nord-Sud edited by Pierre Reverdy, along with Guillaume Apollinaire, Tristan Tzara, Jean Cocteau, André Breton, Louis Aragon and Max Jacob, until a disagreement with Reverdy forced him to leave the magazine. That same year he published &quot;Horizon carré&quot;, including poems previously shown in &quot;El espejo de agua&quot; translated to French with the help of Juan Gris.

In October 1918, Huidobro traveled to Madrid, making the first in a series of annual trips to that city. There he shared both &quot;Creacionismo&quot; and his knowledge of the Parisian vanguard with the artistic elite. In Madrid, Vicente met with Robert and Sonia Delaunay, refugees in Spain, and resumed his friendship with Rafael Cansinos-Assens. He started the literary movement &quot;Ultraísmo&quot;, corresponded with Tristan Tzara and collaborated with him on his Dadaist magazine.

In 1919, he brought to Madrid a rough draft of the series of poems that would eventually become his masterpiece, &quot;Altazor&quot;. That same year, he took some science classes and became interested in esoteric subjects like astrology, alchemy, ancient Kabbalah among other forms of occultism.

While in Paris, he worked with Amédée Ozenfant and Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris) at L&#x27; Esprit Nóuveau, a magazine directed by Paul Dermée. There he also worked for the Spanish magazines &quot;Grecia&quot;, &quot;Cervantes&quot;, &quot;Tableros&quot; and &quot;Ultra&quot;.

In the El Liberal, a Spanish newspaper, journalist and literary critic Enrique Gómez Carrillo published an interview with Pierre Reverdy where he accuses Huidobro of antedating the edition of &quot;El espejo de agua&quot; and claims that he himself created &quot;creacionismo&quot;. Grecia magazine took Huidobro&#x27;s side, and between August and September Huidobro traveled to Madrid to refute Gómez Carrillo&#x27;s claims.
===Altazor and creacionismo===

In 1921, Huidobro founded and edited an international art magazine, &quot;Creación&quot; (Creation), in Madrid. The magazine featured a Lipchitz sculpture and paintings by Georges Braque, Picasso, Juan Gris and Albert Gleizes. In November he printed a second issue in Paris, titled &quot;Création Revue d&#x27;Art&quot;. In December he presented his famous lecture, &quot;La Poesía&quot; (&quot;Poetry&quot;), which served as prologue to his works &quot;Temblor de Cielo&quot; (&quot;Tremor of Heaven&quot;), and &quot;Saisons Choisies&quot; (Chosen Seasons).

The next year, Huidobro presented his theory of &quot;Pure Creation&quot; at &quot;Branche Studio&quot; in Paris, and then in Berlin and Stockholm.He wrote for the Polish magazine &quot;Nowa Sztuka&quot;. In Paris, his &quot;Painted poems&quot; exhibition at the Théâtre Edouard VII was shut down for being too &quot;disruptive&quot;.

In 1923, he published &quot;Finis Britannia&quot;, a critique of the British empire, which provoked antipathy from the British and resulted in him receiving a postcard in support from Mahatma Gandhi. In 1924 he was -arguably- kidnapped for this reason, disappearing for three days. Later in an interview, he briefly commented that the perpetrators of the kidnap were two &quot;Irish scouts&quot; but refused to give more details.

Huidobro continued with his diverse artistic activities in Europe, producing the third edition of &quot;Création&quot;, where he published his &quot;Manifeste peut-être&quot; (Maybe Manifesto). Collaborator in this edition included Tristan Tzara, René Crevel, Juan Larrea and Erik Satie. He joined the French Masonic Lodge and met Spanish philosopher and writer Miguel de Unamuno, who was exiled in Paris at the time.

In 1925 he returned to Chile, where he edited and published &quot;Acción. Diario de Purificación Nacional&quot; (Action: Journal of National Purification) a political newspaper where he criticised the state and reported fraudulent activities. He was consequently assaulted and beaten outside his home and, on 21 November, the newspaper was shut down. He started another newspaper, &quot;La reforma&quot; (Reform), in a symbolic gesture, young supporters of the progressive party declared him as their candidate for president. A bomb was then set off outside his house, though Huidobro escaped unharmed.
While in Chile, he wrote for the publications &quot;Andamios&quot;, &quot;Panorama&quot; and &quot;Ariel&quot; and published &quot;Automne Régulier&quot; (Regular Autumn) and &quot;Tout à coup&quot; (Suddenly).

In 1926, he published a fragment of what would become the fourth canto of &quot;Altazor&quot; in &quot;Panorama&quot;.

In 1927, he traveled to New York, where he met Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks and Gloria Swanson, wrote a script for a film of his novel &quot;Cagliostro&quot;, and wrote the &quot;Canto a Lindbergh&quot; (Song for Lindbergh) dedicated to aviator Charles Lindbergh.

He returned to Europe by the late 1920s, where he began to write the novel, &quot;Mío Cid Campeador&quot;; he also continued his work on &quot;Altazor&quot; and began &quot;Temblor de Cielo&quot; (Tremor of Heaven). It was at this time that he discovered that he was heir to the Marquisate of Casa Real. He also participated in the Mandrágora, a Chilean surrealist movement founded in 1938. There was a scandal when he married Ximena Amunátegui in a Muslim ceremony.

In 1930, while in the Italian Alps, he wrote &quot;La Proxima&quot; (The Next), and published his poem &quot;Chanson de l&#x27;oeuf et de l&#x27;infini&quot; (Song of the Egg and Infinity) in the magazine &quot;Revue Européenne&quot; and a fragment of &quot;Altazor&quot;, in French, in the June edition of &quot;Transition&quot;.

In 1931, he went back to Madrid to publish &quot;Altazor&quot;, where he attended Federico García Lorca&#x27;s poetry recital &quot;Poet in New York&quot; and started his friendship with Uruguayan painter Joaquín Torres García. The same year he published &quot;Portrait of a Paladin&quot; and the English versions of his &quot;Mío Cid Campeador&quot;, &quot;Temblor de Cielo&quot; and &quot;Altazor&quot;.

==Back to Chile==

Huidobro went back to Chile in 1932, under the pressure of the Great Depression. In Chile, he published &quot;Gilles de Raíz&quot;.

In 1933, he got involved with the Communist Party of Chile and published his article &quot;Manifiesto a la juventud de Hispanoamérica&quot; (Manifesto to the Youth of Hispano America) in Barcelona&#x27;s &quot;Europa&quot; magazine, where he proposed the creation of a united republic formed of Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.

In 1934 he wrote film reviews for Santiago magazines and newspapers, and published &quot;La Próxima&quot; (The Next) (Santiago, Walton); &quot;Papá o el diario de Alicia Mir&quot; (Father, or the diary of Alicia Mir) (Santiago, Walton), a novel written as a diary; and the play &quot;En la Luna&quot; (In the Moon) (Santiago, Ercilla). He founded the magazine Vital/Ombligo with Omar Cáceres and Eduardo Anguita.

In 1935 a young Volodia Teitelboim read a Rabindranath Tagore poem, similar to Poem 16 of Neruda&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair&quot;, Teitelboim mentioned this to Huidobro, and Huidobro accused Neruda of plagiarism. This would initiate a conflict between Neruda and Huidobro that later would involve Pablo de Rokha.

In 1936, along with Picasso, Arp, Kandinsky, and Robert and Sonia Delaunay among others, he signed the &quot;Dimensionist Manifesto&quot;

In 1937, while in Spain supporting the republican cause, the conflict with Neruda resurfaced while Neruda was also supporting the republicans. The Parisian &quot;Association Internationale des Ecrivains pour la Défense de la Culture&quot;, sending them a letter which called on them to change their attitude, signed by Tristan Tzara, Alejo Carpentier, César Vallejo and Juan Larrea, among others.

Once back in Chile, he published the prose poem &quot;Fuera de aquí&quot; (Out of Here), arguing against Italian fascism and the Italian military (who were visiting Chile at that time), as well as the poem &quot;Gloria y Sangre&quot; (Glory and Blood) in &quot;Madre España: Homenaje de los poetas chilenos&quot; (Mother Spain: Tribute of the Chilean poets). In 1938 his mother died, and he became part of the creation of the Chilean surrealist group La Mandrágora. The first meetings of the group took place in his home.

==Last years==

In 1942, Huidobro published the second editions of &quot;Temblor de cielo&quot;, &quot;Cagliostro&quot; and &quot;Mio Cid Campeador&quot; in Santiago.

In 1944, he edited and published the first and last edition of &quot;Actual&quot;, the final magazine he would create. In November of that year he traveled back to Europe and made a stop in Montevideo, Uruguay to give a lecture on &quot;Introducción a la poesía&quot; (Introduction to Poetry). In 1945 he went to Paris as a correspondent for “La Voz de América&quot;. In Paris, he received a letter from his wife Ximena informing him of her wish for a divorce. He entered Berlin (as a war correspondent) with the Allies. He was discharged and went back to Santiago with his third wife, Raquel Señoret.

In 1946 he settled in Cartagena, a seaside town in central Chile, and published a new edition of &quot;Trois Nouvelles Exemplaires&quot;, with text written in collaboration with Jean Arp.

The following year he suffered a stroke attributed to his war wounds, and died on 2 January 1948, in his Cartagena house. According to his wishes, he was buried on a hill facing the sea. His eldest daughter Manuela and Eduardo Anguita wrote the epitaph: &quot;Aquí yace el poeta Vicente Huidobro / Abrid la tumba / Al fondo de esta tumba se ve el mar&quot;. (Here lies the poet Vicente Huidobro / Open the tomb / At the bottom you can see the sea). That same year, Manuela published unedited texts and poems previously seen only in magazines.

Huidobro wrote over thirty works, including books of poetry and poetic narrative, of which more than a dozen were published posthumously.

==Vicente Huidobro Museum and Foundation==

The Vicente Huidobro Foundation was created in 1990, in order to preserve the poet&#x27;s works. The foundation runs a research center and archive, which is open to researchers, students and general public. On 6 April 2013 Huidobro&#x27;s house in Cartagena was converted into a museum, with help of funds from FONDART. The museum, which has six rooms and a floor space of 320 square metres, will be run by the Vicente Huidobro Foundation, and will showcase manuscripts, correspondence, first editions of Huidobro&#x27;s works, photographs and his collection of African art, among other items.

==Tribute==
On January 10, 2020, Google celebrated his 127th birthday with a Google Doodle.

The Spanglish novel Yo-Yo Boing! (1998) by Puerto Rican poet Giannina Braschi features a debate about creators and masters of Spanish and Latin American poetry, including Huidobro, Luis Cernuda, Alberti, Vicente Aleixandre, Pedro Salinas, and Jorge Guillén.

Chile printed several postage stamps of portraits of Huidobro, including in 1986 and 1993.

<doc id="385299" wikidata="Q4661432" url="?curid=385299" title="Aama (1964 film)">
<text>Aama () is a 1964 Nepali drama film directed by Hira Singh Khatri in his directorial debut. The film is written by Durga Shrestha and Chaitya Devi. &quot;Aama&quot; was produced by King Mahendra of Nepal under the banner of Information Department of Government of Nepal (formally Royal Nepal Film Corporation). The film stars Shiva Shankar and Bhuwan Chand, with Basundhara Bhusal, Chitya Devi Singh, Hira Singh Khatri and Hari Prasad Rimal, in supporting roles. It follows a young man who returns home after serving in his country&#x27;s army.

Hira Singh Khatri, was requested by Mahendra of Nepal to direct &quot;Aama.&quot; The film&#x27;s post-production and indoor filming were mainly done in Kolkata, India. It was released on 7 October 1964. After the release, &quot;Aama&quot; became the first Nepalese film to be produced in Nepal.

After the film&#x27;s release in Nepal, it quickly became popular in the country. After the success of &quot;Aama&quot;, Khatri directed the films &quot;Hijo Aaja Bholi&quot; (1967), and &quot;Parivartan&quot; (1971) for the Nepalese government, both of which were used to convey patriotism to Nepalese citizens. &quot;Aama&quot; is regarded as one of the most important films in the history of Nepalese cinema.

== Plot ==
Harka Bahadur is an alcoholic who physically abuses his wife. One day later, his house is being repossessed due to non-payment of loan repayments, after which Harka Bahadur promises his wife he will give up drinking. Later that day, he returns to his house drunk and starts attacking his wife but dies after being struck by lightning. After his death, Harka&#x27;s son Man Bahadur (Shiva Shankar) leaves his house to join the army.

A few years later, Man returns home after serving in a foreign army for two years but cannot find his mother. After hearing about his mother&#x27;s death, Man decides to leave Nepal but his neighbours persuade him to stay in the village and serve the community, saying that &quot;service to the motherland is equally virtuous as service to a mother&quot;. Man Bahadur says he will remain in Nepal to help his country&#x27;s growing economy.

== Production ==
Mahendra of Nepal requested prominent film director Hira Singh Khatri, who was mainly working in Indian cinema, to direct &quot;Aama&quot;, which was made to develop Nepali cinema and to promote Nepali art and culture through it. In the early years of Nepalese cinema there was no professional infrastructure in the country to produce, distribute, and present Nepalese cinema. There were no professional actors so the director chose Nepalese singer-songwriter Shiva Shankar and theatrical performer Bhuwan Chand. Shiva Shankar was chosen to play the lead actor in the film because the director&#x27;s original choice for the role was home sick. The leading female actor Bhuwan Chand remembered being &quot;very excited&quot; about acting in the film; she said it &quot;was one of the incidents of my life I can never forget&quot;. At the age of fourteen, Hari Prasad Rimal also made his acting debut in &quot;Aama&quot;.

Filming on the project lasted between three and four months, and the post-production work, which was completed in Kolkata, India, took about six months. Most of the scenes were filmed in a single take. Bhuwan Chand was paid about 5,000 rupees ($45.01 as of April 2019). Chand told &quot;Kathmandu Craze&quot;, &quot;the director of the film had asked for cameramen&#x27;s opinion and he responded in my favour. So it was cameraman Dev and of course the director who were responsible for me receiving the part.&quot;

== Release ==
The film premiered on 7 October 1964, in the Kathmandu Valley. Upon release, the film met with success. Sunita of &quot;Films Of Nepal&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Aama&quot; took the nation by storm&quot;. After the success of the film, director Hira Singh Khatri went on to direct &quot;Hijo Aaja Bholi&quot; (1967), and &quot;Parivartan&quot; (1971), films which were used to convey patriotism to Nepalese citizens. &quot;Aama&quot; became an important film in history of Nepalese cinema, after becoming the first Nepalese film to be produced in Nepal. Following its release, the leading actors became publicly prominent. &quot;Kathmandu Films&quot;, wrote &quot;This [&quot;Aama&quot;] was the most important event in history of filming in Nepal&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;BossNepal&quot; wrote, &quot;The title of the movie did justice to it ... &quot;Aama&quot; (mother) gives us a glimpse of what to expect and meets people&#x27;s expectations as well. It goes perfectly with the theme of the movie&quot;. The reviewer also said, &quot;&quot;Aama&quot; deserves a watch&quot;. Philip Cryan Marshall of &quot;Migyul&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Aama&quot; was clearly a nation-building tool&quot;, and &quot;The image of the mother, a universal symbol of national unity, was used to forward themes of nationalization. Characters ... were dressed in distinct garbs of the nation – men in daura suruwal and dhaka topi and women draped in saree and cholo fariya&quot;.

<text>Samuel Allyne Otis (November 24, 1740 – April 22, 1814) was an American politician who was the first Secretary of the United States Senate, serving for its first 25 years.

== Early political career ==
Otis was a delegate to both the Second Continental Congress, from 1777 to 1778, and to the Congress of the Confederation in 1787 and 1788. He was also a Massachusetts state representative, serving as speaker in 1784 and 1785, and an unsuccessful congressional candidate in 1788.

==Secretary of the Senate==
Early in 1789, as plans went forward for establishing the new Congress under the recently ratified Constitution, a heated contest developed for the job of Senate Secretary. The obvious candidate was dapper sixty-year-old Charles Thomson, secretary of the soon-to-expire Continental Congress during its entire fifteen-year existence. But Thomson weakened his candidacy by telling friends that he had a different secretarial post in mind—one in George Washington&#x27;s cabinet. As the March 1789 convening date of the Senate neared, however, Thomson realized that he had no chance of landing a cabinet appointment. Consequently, he decided he would indeed like to become the first Secretary of the Senate—as well as Secretary of the House and Secretary of the entire government. This would not be too taxing, he thought, because he expected to have an assistant who would &quot;do the ordinary business of the [Senate], so that I may not be under the necessity of attending except on special occasions and when the great business of the Nation is under deliberation.&quot; This expression of Thomson&#x27;s lofty self-importance helps explain why he had attracted a more-than-usual number of enemies during his public career.

A group of those foes devised a scheme—disguised as an honor—to get him out of town during the crucial last-minute maneuvering leading to the Secretary&#x27;s election. Congressional leaders asked Thomson to travel from the nation&#x27;s temporary New York City capital to Virginia to &quot;notify&quot; George Washington of his election and accompany the president-elect back to New York. Washington needed no notification, but he accepted Thomson&#x27;s companionship in good humor. With Thomson safely away from the Senate, Vice President-elect John Adams maneuvered for the election of his own candidate—Samuel Allyne Otis.

Supremely qualified for the job, the forty-eight-year-old Otis had been a former quartermaster of the Continental Army, speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, member of Congress under the Articles of Confederation, and John Adams&#x27; long-term ally. On April 8, 1789, two days after the Senate achieved its first quorum, members elected Otis as their chief legislative, financial, and administrative officer.

Otis&#x27; early duties combined symbolism and substance. On April 30, he had the high honor of holding the Bible as George Washington took his presidential oath of office. Throughout that first session, which lasted until September, Otis tirelessly engaged the many tasks associated with establishing a new institution. As the Senate set down its legislative procedures and carefully negotiated relations with the House and President Washington, Otis became a key player. 

Others noticed and several coveted his increasingly influential job. Among the contenders was William Jackson, a secretary to President Washington. Jackson asked Washington to advance his prospects by removing Otis from the scene—through an appointment to a federal post in Massachusetts. Washington failed to cooperate, perhaps thinking that John Adams might view this as executive meddling in legislative affairs. From 1789 to 1801—the period of Adams&#x27; eight years as Vice President, and four as President—Otis enjoyed great job security. The situation changed in 1801. The electoral &quot;Revolution of 1800&quot;, which shifted control of Congress and the presidency from the Adams Federalists to the Jeffersonian Republicans, gave Otis reason to begin checking his retirement options. When John Quincy Adams became a senator in 1803, he reported to his father that Otis &quot;is much alarmed at the prospect of being removed from office. It has been signified to him that in order to retain it, he must have all the [Senate&#x27;s] printing done by [William] Duane [editor of an anti-Adams newspaper]. His compliance may possibly preserve him one session longer.&quot; The Senate subsequently awarded Duane the lucrative contract.

Through the considerable political turbulence between 1800 and 1814, Samuel Otis held on as Secretary. But with the passing years, Otis appeared to some as less vigorous in attending to his duties. Senators complained that the Senate Journal was not being kept up to date, official communications not recorded in a timely way, and records kept in a &quot;blind confused manner&quot; – but no one actively moved to replace him. Like Continental Congress Secretary Charles Thomson, Otis had become the body&#x27;s institutional memory at a time of great turnover among members. 

When the seventy-three-year-old Otis died on April 22, 1814, having not missed a single day&#x27;s work in twenty-five years, senators seemed to truly lament his death. The stability that he brought to the office endured well into the nineteenth century. His successor, former New Hampshire Senator Charles Cutts, served for eleven years. Cutts&#x27; successor, former Pennsylvania Senator Walter Lowrie, held the post from 1825 to 1836, followed by Asbury Dickins, who came within six months of breaking Otis&#x27; still-standing quarter-century service record. When Dickins retired in 1861 at age eighty, the Senate voted him an additional year&#x27;s salary, using language that would have been equally fitting for Otis – &quot;an old and faithful servant of the Senate.&quot;

<text>Crystal Palace Football Club, commonly referred to as simply Palace, is a professional football club based in Selhurst, South London, England, which competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Although formally created as a professional outfit in 1905 at the Crystal Palace Exhibition building, the club&#x27;s origins can be traced as far back as 1861. The club used the FA Cup final stadium situated inside the grounds of the Palace for their home games between 1905 and 1915, when they were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the First World War. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.

Palace spent their early years as a professional club playing in the Southern League, winning various regional titles. They were elected to the Football League in 1920, and have overall mainly competed in the top two tiers of English football during their league history. Since 1964, Palace have only dropped below the second tier once for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Palace became a force in the top flight and challenged Arsenal and Liverpool for the English league title in 1990–91, but eventually ended the season in third place, the club&#x27;s highest league finish to date. They only missed out on qualification for the UEFA Cup at the end of that season due to the limited number of European places available to English clubs after the lifting of the UEFA ban caused by the Heysel Stadium disaster. Palace also reached the FA Cup final in 1990, narrowly losing to Manchester United after a replay, and were founder members of the Premier League.

However, Palace went into decline after their relegation from the Premier League in 1998, suffering financial problems which resulted in the club going into administration twice in 1999 and 2010. They eventually recovered and were promoted back to the Premier League in 2013, where the club have remained ever since and reached another FA Cup final in 2016, again finishing runners-up to Manchester United. The club are currently on their longest continuous run in the top flight, achieving twelve consecutive seasons at the start of the 2024–25 campaign.

The club&#x27;s kit colours were claret and blue until 1973, when they changed to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, and also share strong rivalries with local clubs Millwall and Charlton Athletic.

==History==


===The Crystal Palace Company (1854–1905)===
In 1854, the Crystal Palace Exhibition building had been relocated from Hyde Park, London, and rebuilt in an area of South London next to Sydenham Hill. This area was renamed Crystal Palace which included the Crystal Palace Park that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. The Crystal Palace Company who owned the exhibition building founded the Crystal Palace Club in 1857 to play cricket before turning their attention to football. It had been lobbied by existing members of the cricket club to provide a continuation of sporting activities during the winter months. The company formed an amateur Crystal Palace football club in 1861. Many of its original players were members of the cricket club, and they shared the same pitch within the Crystal Palace Park.

The amateur club became one of the original founder members of the Football Association in 1863, and competed in the first FA Cup competition in 1871–72, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the Royal Engineers. They played in the FA Cup over the next four seasons, but disappeared from historical records after a match against Barnes F.C. on 18 December 1875. In 1895, the Football Association found a new permanent venue for the FA Cup final at the sports stadium situated inside the Palace grounds. Some years later the Crystal Palace Company, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form a new professional football club to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area.
===Birth of the professional club and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1905–1920)===
The professional Crystal Palace football club was formed on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of Aston Villa assistant secretary Edmund Goodman. The club applied for election to the Football League, but were rejected and instead found itself in the Southern League Second Division for the 1905–06 season. Palace were successful in their inaugural season achieving promotion to the Southern League First Division, crowned as champions. They also played in the mid-week United League, finishing runners-up to Watford, and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 3–0 away to New Brompton.
Palace remained in the Southern League up until 1914, their one highlight the 1907 shock First Round victory over Newcastle United in the FA Cup. The outbreak of the First World War led to the Admiralty requisitioning the Crystal Palace and its grounds, which meant the club was forced to leave and they moved to the home of nearby West Norwood F.C. at Herne Hill Velodrome. Three years later they moved again to the Nest following the demise of Croydon Common F.C..

The Palace stadium was almost destroyed in an attempted terrorist bombing of the 1913 FA Cup final, when the suffragettes of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union, plotted to blow up the stands. This was part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, in which the suffragettes carried out a series of politically motivated bombing and arson attacks nationwide, as part of their campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage.

===Into the Football League (1920–1958)===
The club became founder members of the new Football League Third Division in the 1920–21 season, finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the Second Division. This achievement meant they joined Preston North End, Small Heath, Liverpool, and Bury as the only clubs at that time to have won a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace then moved to a new stadium Selhurst Park in 1924, where the club still play their home games today.

The opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against The Wednesday, with Palace losing 0–1 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club were relegated to the Third Division South. Before the Second World War, Palace made good efforts at promotion, mostly finishing in the top half of the table and were runners-up on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two Wartime Leagues. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for re-election.

===Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958–1973)===

The club remained in the Third Division South up until the end of the 1957–58 season, after which the league was restructured with clubs in the bottom half of the Third Division South merging with those in the bottom half of the Third Division North to form a new Fourth Division. Palace had finished fourteenth – just below the cut – and were consigned to the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman Arthur Wait appointed the ex-Tottenham manager Arthur Rowe in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The 1960–61 season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great Real Madrid team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play Benfica in the European Cup final. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4–3. Although Rowe resigned for health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club&#x27;s history. Dick Graham and then Bert Head guided Palace to successive promotions in 1963–64 and 1968–69, taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the First Division.

Palace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5–0 home win against Manchester United in the 1972–73 season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed Malcolm Allison as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.

===Bouncing between the divisions (1973–1984)===
After the disappointment of demotion from the top flight, the next season was to prove even worse for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace suffered a second consecutive relegation, and found itself back in Division Three for the 1974–75 season. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from &quot;The Glaziers&quot; to &quot;The Eagles&quot;, and ended its association with claret and blue kit colours by changing to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the 1975–76 FA Cup, beating Leeds and Chelsea along the way, but lost 0–2 in the semi-final at Stamford Bridge to the eventual winners, Southampton. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975–76 season after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under Terry Venables&#x27; management that Palace moved back up to the top flight with promotions in 1976–77 and 1978–79; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.

That team from 1979 was dubbed the &quot;Team of the Eighties&quot;, because it included a number of very talented young players who had emerged from the youth team which won the FA Youth Cup in 1976–77 and 1977–78, and they were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the 1979–80 season. However, financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that group of players, and this ultimately led to Palace being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in 1980–81, coinciding with Ron Noades&#x27; takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier and Noades even appointed the ex-Brighton manager Alan Mullery, which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.

===Steve Coppell years (1984–1993)===
On 4 June 1984, the former Manchester United and England player Steve Coppell, who had recently retired from the game due to injury, was appointed as Palace manager. Coppell rebuilt the club steadily over the next few years which resulted in the Eagles achieving promotion back to the top flight via the play-offs in 1988–89. Palace followed this up by reaching the 1990 FA Cup final, drawing 3–3 with Manchester United after extra-time in the first match, but losing the replay 0–1. The club built on this success and the 1990–91 campaign saw Palace challenge Arsenal and Liverpool for the English league title, but eventually ended the season in third place to achieve their highest league finish to date. Palace missed out on a European place at the end of that season partly due to the UEFA ban on English clubs caused by the Heysel Stadium disaster. Though by that time the ban had been lifted, it resulted in England being unranked in the UEFA coefficient rankings used that season, which meant the English top flight was only entitled to one European place in the UEFA Cup, and this went to the runners-up Liverpool. The club also returned to Wembley and won the Full Members Cup, beating Everton 4–1 after extra-time in the final. During the following season, star striker Ian Wright left the club to join Arsenal. Palace finished tenth, and became a founding member of the new Premier League in 1992–93.
Palace then sold their other top striker Mark Bright to Sheffield Wednesday, and struggled to score goals throughout the next season which ended with the club relegated (Losing the final safety spot to Oldham Athletic, who had a superior goal difference of -11, against Palace&#x27;s -13). The Eagles also finished on 49 points, which set a Premier League record that still stands today, for the highest number of points for a relegated club. Coppell resigned and Alan Smith, his assistant at the club, took over as manager.

===The yo-yo years (1993–1998)===
Alan Smith&#x27;s first season as manager saw Palace win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League. Their stay on this occasion proved both eventful and controversial. On 25 January 1995, Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park in which United forward Eric Cantona was sent off. He was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons, and retaliated with a flying kick. Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail, reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal. Simmons was immediately banned from Selhurst Park, and later found guilty on two charges of threatening Cantona. More was to follow in March, when Palace striker Chris Armstrong was suspended by the FA for failing a drugs test. On the field, Smith guided the club to the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and League Cup, but their form in the league was inconsistent and Palace once again found themselves relegated, finishing fourth from bottom as the Premier League was reduced from 22 to 20 clubs.

Smith left the club and Steve Coppell returned as technical director in the summer of 1995, and through a combination of the first-team coaching of Ray Lewington and latterly Dave Bassett&#x27;s managership, Palace reached the play-offs. They lost the 1996 First Division play-off final in dramatic fashion when Steve Claridge scored in the last minute of extra-time for Leicester City to win 2–1. The following season saw Coppell take charge as first-team manager when Bassett departed for Nottingham Forest in early 1997. The club reached the play-offs for the second year running and this time achieved promotion back to the Premier League, when they defeated Sheffield United 1–0 in the final at Wembley.

The club&#x27;s third campaign in the Premier League was no more successful than the previous two, and in true yo-yo club fashion, Palace again suffered relegation back to the First Division at the end of the 1997–98 season. The club also had a new owner when recruitment tycoon Mark Goldberg completed his takeover in June 1998.

===Financial crisis (1998–2010)===
Terry Venables returned to Palace for a second spell as manager and the club competed in European competition during the summer when they played in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. Palace then went into administration in 1999, when owner Mark Goldberg was unable to sustain his financial backing of the club. Venables left and Steve Coppell took over again as manager. The club emerged from administration under the ownership of Simon Jordan, and Coppell was replaced as manager by Alan Smith for a second time. Palace were almost relegated to the third tier in Jordan&#x27;s first season, in 2000–01. Smith was sacked in April and long-serving coach Steve Kember took over as caretaker manager and he managed to win the two remaining fixtures that would guarantee Palace survival, with Dougie Freedman scoring the winner in the 87th minute on the final day of the season, securing a 1–0 victory over Stockport County. Former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce was appointed manager for the 2001–02 season. A good start to the season gave Palace hope for a promotion challenge, but Bruce attempted to walk out on the club after just four months in charge following an approach from Birmingham City to become their new manager. After a short spell on gardening leave, Bruce was eventually allowed to join Birmingham, and was succeeded by Trevor Francis, who had been his predecessor at the West Midlands club.

Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, but he was then sacked, and replaced by Steve Kember, who became permanent manager. The club won their opening three games of the 2003–04 season under Kember, which put them at the top of the table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw Palace slip towards the relegation zone. Former Palace striker Iain Dowie was appointed manager and guided the club to the play-off final, securing promotion with a 1–0 victory over West Ham. Again Palace could not maintain their place in the top tier and were relegated on the last day of the season after drawing at local rivals Charlton Athletic.
Following that relegation, Simon Jordan was unable to put the club on a sound financial footing over the next few years, and in January 2010, Palace were once again placed in administration, this time by a creditor. Due to the Football League&#x27;s regulations, the club were deducted ten points, and the administrators P&amp;A Partnership were forced to sell key players including Victor Moses and José Fonte. Neil Warnock had also departed as manager in the early part of 2010. He had been appointed in 2007, replacing the former Palace favourite Peter Taylor who had a brief spell as manager. Paul Hart took over as caretaker manager for the final weeks of the season. Survival in the Championship was only secured on the final day of the season after a memorable 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday, which was itself relegated as a result.

During the close of that season, CPFC 2010, a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans, successfully negotiated the purchase of the club. They were led by Steve Parish, the vocal representative for the consortium of four that also included Stephen Browett, Jeremy Hosking and Martin Long. Crucially, the consortium also secured the freehold of Selhurst Park, and paid tribute to a fans&#x27; campaign which helped pressure Lloyds Bank into selling the ground back to the club.

===Established back in the Premier League (2010–present)===
The CPFC 2010 consortium swiftly installed George Burley as the new Palace manager. However a poor start to the following season saw the club hovering around the bottom of the table by December. On 1 January 2011, after a 0–3 defeat to Millwall, Burley was sacked and his assistant Dougie Freedman named caretaker manager. Just over a week later Freedman was appointed manager on a full-time basis. Palace moved up the table and by securing a 1–1 draw at Hull City on 30 April, the club was safe from relegation with one game of the season left. After another year and a half as manager, Freedman departed to manage Bolton Wanderers on 23 October 2012.

In November 2012, Ian Holloway became the new Palace manager. He guided the club back to the Premier League after an eight-year absence by defeating Watford 1–0 in the Championship play-off final at the new Wembley, but resigned in October 2013. Following a brief spell under Tony Pulis, and an unsuccessful second tenure for Neil Warnock, former Palace player Alan Pardew was confirmed as the new manager in January 2015. In his first full season, Pardew led the club to the 2016 FA Cup final, their first for 26 years. Palace met Manchester United who they had lost to in the 1990 final, and the Eagles suffered disappointment again losing 1–2 after extra-time. In December 2016, Pardew was sacked and replaced by Sam Allardyce, who kept the club in the Premier League, but resigned unexpectedly at the end of the season. On 26 June 2017, Palace appointed Frank de Boer as their first permanent foreign manager. He was dismissed after only 77 days in charge, with the club having lost their first four league games at the start of the 2017–18 season while failing to score in any of them. Former England manager Roy Hodgson was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager the next day. Palace finished in eleventh-place in the Premier League in Hodgson&#x27;s first season, twelfth in the 2018–19 season and fourteenth the following season.

On 18 May 2021, the club announced Hodgson would be leaving at the end of the 2020–21 season, upon the expiration of his contract, having achieved a second consecutive fourteenth-place. On 4 July 2021, Palace appointed the former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira as their new manager on a three-year contract. Despite guiding the club to an FA Cup semi-final and a twelfth-place league finish in his first season, Vieira was sacked during the next campaign on 17 March 2023, after a winless run of 12 games left the club three points above the relegation zone.

On 21 March 2023, Hodgson was re-appointed Palace manager until the end of the season. He guided the club to safety, finishing comfortably in eleventh place. On 3 July, Hodgson was appointed permanent manager for a second time, though he stepped down from the role prematurely on 19 February 2024. He was replaced by former Eintracht Frankfurt and VfL Wolfsburg manager Oliver Glasner. The club achieved a strong finish at the end of the 2023–24 season under Glasner, equalling their highest Premier League finish of tenth place, and highest points total of 49. Subsequently, four Palace players (Ebere Eze, Marc Guéhi, Dean Henderson and Adam Wharton) were named in the English national team for Euro 2024, more than any other Premier League club for England at the tournament.

==Colours and crest==

The original amateur club wore blue and white hooped shirts with blue shorts, although there were variations on this, it is thought their first kit in 1861 was light blue and white halves. When the professional Crystal Palace club was created in 1905, its choice of colours were originally claret and blue shirts paired with white shorts and socks tending to be claret. This was a result of the important role in the club&#x27;s formation played by Edmund Goodman, an Aston Villa employee who later became Palace manager. The club kept to this formula fairly consistently until 1938, when they decided to abandon the claret and blue and adopt white shirts and black shorts with matching socks. They returned to claret and blue from 1949 to 1954, but in 1955 the club reverted to white and black, using claret and blue trim.

There were variations on this theme until 1963, when the club adopted the away strip of yellow shirts as its home colours. In 1964, the club changed to an all-white strip modelled on Real Madrid whom Palace had played recently in a friendly, before they returned to claret and blue jerseys with white shorts in 1966. The club continued with variations on this theme up until Malcolm Allison&#x27;s arrival as manager in 1973. Allison overhauled the club&#x27;s image, adopting red and blue vertical stripes for colours and kit, inspired by FC Barcelona. Palace have played in variations of red and blue ever since, bar the centenary season of 2005 which saw them wear a version of their 1971–72 claret, blue and white kit.

The club was relatively late in establishing a crest. Although the initials were embroidered on the shirt from the 1935–36 season, a crest featuring the façade of The Crystal Palace did not appear until 1955. This crest disappeared from the shirt in 1964, and the team&#x27;s name appeared embroidered on shirts, between 1967 and 1972. A round badge was then adopted in 1972, with the club&#x27;s initials and nickname the &quot;Glaziers&quot; before Allison changed this too. The club&#x27;s nickname became the &quot;Eagles&quot;, inspired by Portuguese club Benfica, with the badge showing the image of an eagle holding a ball. This emblem remained until 1987 when the club married the eagle with the Crystal Palace façade, and although updated in 1996 and again in 2012, the crest retains these features. In June 2022, the club changed the year of its crest from 1905 to 1861, reflecting when the original Crystal Palace Football Club was established.

From mid-2010 to 2020, the club made use of an American bald eagle, called Kayla, as the club mascot, with the bird flying from one end of the stadium to the other at every home game. The bird died in June 2020.

===Kit manufacturers and sponsors===
Since 2022, Crystal Palace&#x27;s kit has been manufactured by Macron. Previous manufacturers include Umbro (1975–77), Admiral (1977–80, 1987–88, 2003–04), Adidas (1980–83, 1996–99), Hummel (1984–87), Bukta (1988–93), Ribero (1992–94), Nutmeg (1994–96), TFG Sports (1999–2001), Le Coq Sportif (2001–03), Diadora (2004–07), Erreà (2007–09), Nike (2009–12), Avec (2012–14), Macron (2014–18, 2022–present), and Puma (2018–22).

The club&#x27;s shirts are currently sponsored by NET88 (2024–present). Previous sponsors have been Red Rose (1983–84), Top Score (1985–86), AVR (1986–87), Andrew Copeland (1987–88), Fly Virgin (1988–91), Tulip Computers (1991–93), TDK (1993–99), Churchill Insurance (2000–06), GAC Logistics (2006–14), Neteller (2014–15), Mansion.com (2015–17), ManBetX (2017–20), W88 (2020–22) and cinch (2022–24).

The club signed its first sleeve sponsor with All Football, a Chinese football-based social media application in 2017.

In 2023, Crystal Palace and Kaiyun Sports announced their joint partnership for the company to become the club&#x27;s official new sleeve sponsor.

==Stadium==

In 1905, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the FA Cup final venue situated inside the grounds of The Crystal Palace, wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. They formed a new professional Crystal Palace football club to play at the stadium. When the First World War broke out, the Palace and grounds were seized by the armed forces, and in 1915 the club were forced to move by the Admiralty. They found a temporary base at the Herne Hill Velodrome. Although other clubs offered the use of their grounds to Palace, the club felt it best to remain as close to their natural catchment area as possible. When Croydon Common F.C. were wound up in 1917, Palace took over their old stadium located at the Nest. In 1919, they began the purchase of the land on which they would eventually build Selhurst Park, their current home.

The renowned stadium architect Archibald Leitch was employed to draw up plans, and the construction of Selhurst Park was completed in time for the 1924–25 season. The stadium remained relatively unchanged, with only the introduction of floodlights and some maintenance improvements until 1969, when the Arthur Wait Stand was built. The Main Stand became all-seater in the summer of 1981 and more work followed in the next few years, when the Whitehorse Lane End was redeveloped to allow for a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, club offices and a club shop. The Arthur Wait Stand became all-seater in 1990, and in 1994 the Holmesdale Terrace was replaced with a new two tier stand.

Selhurst Park&#x27;s record attendance was set in 1979, with an official total of 51,482. After all the redevelopments to the ground and safety requirements due to the Taylor Report, the current capacity is 25,486.

In 2011, proposals were put forward to move the club back to their original home at the Crystal Palace National Stadium, but after the club gained promotion to the Premier League in 2013, there has been a renewed focus on redeveloping Selhurst Park into a 40,000 seater stadium.
Revised plans for a new 13,500-seater Main Stand (extending overall stadium capacity to 34,000) were approved at a Croydon Council meeting on 19 April 2018. However these plans were subsequently delayed firstly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and latterly the club&#x27;s focus on delivering its Academy upgrade at Beckenham which was completed in 2021. When the club finally began to push again for the stand redevelopment, further delays occurred due to opposition to the demolition of houses in nearby Wooderson Close. The club signed a legal agreement to provide replacement homes to relocate residents. In August 2024, the expansion of the Main Stand was re-approved by Croydon Council and preliminary works commenced with proposed completion by the summer of 2027.

==Supporters==

Crystal Palace have a fan base predominantly from the local area which draws on South London, Kent, and Surrey. Their original home at the Crystal Palace was on the boundary with Kent, while Selhurst Park was located within the borders of Surrey, until the London Government Act 1963 saw Greater London encompass Croydon. The club&#x27;s passionate support at home games emanates from the Holmesdale Road Stand, in which the ultras group the Holmesdale Fanatics have been based since 2005.

The fans have established at least two other supporters groups. The Palace Independent Supporters&#x27; Association was set up to raise supporter concerns with the club, while the Crystal Palace Supporters&#x27; Trust was originally established to enable fans to purchase the club during the administration of 2000 and remained in existence up to the end of 2023.

A number of fanzines have been produced by the supporters over the years. &quot;Eagle Eye&quot; was launched in 1987 and ran until 1994, with a number of contributors producing the replacement &quot;Palace Echo&quot; in 1995, which continued until 2007. &quot;The Eastern Eagles&quot;, &quot;So Glad You&#x27;re Mine&quot; and &quot;One More Point&quot; were also published by fans in the 1990s. When &quot;One More Point&quot; ceased publication, &quot;Five Year Plan&quot; was launched in its place, and maintains an online presence. Supporters also engage in debate on two internet forums, The BBS and Holmesdale.net which the club use as channels to communicate with the fans.
Because Crystal Palace are a London club, they compete against a number of other local clubs for the attention of supporters, but it does have a recognisably large catchment area of 900,000. When the new owners took control in 2010, they sought the fans&#x27; input into future decisions. They consulted on a new badge design, and when their chosen designs were rejected, the club instead opted for a design based on a fans&#x27; idea from an internet forum. The club have strengthened their ties with the local community, and through the Crystal Palace F.C. Foundation, they work with the local London Boroughs of Croydon, Bromley and Sutton to provide sports and educational programmes which they also hope will continue to develop their supporter and geographical base. The Foundation&#x27;s work was recognised by the Football League in August 2009 with their Silver Standard Community Scheme Award.

The club also enjoys a sizeable celebrity support. Kevin Day and Jo Brand host an annual comedy night for Comic Relief and the Palace Academy, and fellow comedians Eddie Izzard and Mark Steel are also staunch Palace fans. The actor Neil Morrissey developed Palace Ale, a beer on sale in the ground, while fellow actor Bill Nighy is patron of the Crystal Palace Children&#x27;s Charity (CPSCC). Radio DJ David Jensen is chairman of the Crystal Palace Vice Presidents Club, and acted as spokesman for the CPFC 2010 consortium during their takeover bid for the club. Actor, writer and producer John Salthouse was on the books of Palace as a player from 1968 to 1970 under the name of John Lewis, and was also a mascot for the club as a child. He incorporated the club into his role as Tony in Abigail&#x27;s Party. The television presenter Susanna Reid revealed her love of Palace while taking part in &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, and visited Selhurst Park for inspiration.

===Rivalries===
Due to their location in the capital, Crystal Palace are involved in a number of local derbies, mostly across South London. They enjoy rivalries with both Millwall and former tenants Charlton Athletic. The club have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion which developed after Palace&#x27;s relegation to the Third Division in 1974, reaching its height when the two teams were drawn together in the first round of the 1976–77 FA Cup. The tie went to two replays, but the second replay ended in controversy after referee Ron Challis ordered a successful Brighton penalty to be retaken because of reported encroachment by a Brighton player, although other sources also claim that this was due to contact from a Crystal Palace player. The retake was saved, Palace won the tie 1–0 and a fierce rivalry was born.

==Ownership==

The Crystal Palace Company formed both the amateur and professional clubs. The first chairman of the professional Crystal Palace club was Sydney Bourne who was found by club secretary Edmund Goodman after he had examined records of FA Cup final ticket purchasers. Goodman noted his name as one that had bought a number of tickets every year, and so met with Bourne and found him very agreeable to the idea of the new club. Bourne was invited onto the board of directors and elected chairman at the club&#x27;s first meeting. He remained chairman until his death in 1930.

After Bourne&#x27;s death, there were a number of short-term chairmanship appointments: Louis Bellatti (1930–1935), R.S. Flew (1935), Carey Burnett (1935–36), E.T. Truett (1936–1939), before Percy Harper&#x27;s reign (1939–1950). Local builder Arthur Wait established a consortium of seven other businessmen to purchase the club in 1949, and took over from Harper in 1950, initially rotating the chairmanship. In 1958, Wait became the permanent chairman, lasting until 1972 when Raymond Bloye took over. Bloye&#x27;s ownership lasted until 26 January 1981, when property developer Ron Noades and his consortium took control of the club. Noades eventually sold the club to Mark Goldberg on 5 June 1998, becoming the second-longest serving Palace chairman behind Sydney Bourne. However, Noades did maintain ownership of Selhurst Park, leasing it to the club to use. Goldberg&#x27;s tenure of the club was not a success and Palace entered administration in March 1999. Although the fans established a group called the Crystal Palace Supporters&#x27; Trust in a bid to gain control of the club, millionaire and lifelong fan Simon Jordan negotiated a deal with creditors and the administrator, and a new company, CPFC 2000 took control. This company entered administration in January 2010, and it was not until June of that year that a takeover was completed by a consortium of four wealthy fans known as CPFC 2010.

CPFC 2010 was established by a consortium of four businessmen, Steve Parish, Martin Long, Stephen Browett and Jeremy Hosking, with each owning a 25% share of the company. The four successfully negotiated a takeover with the administrator Brendan Guilfoyle from the P&amp;A Partnership and a company voluntary arrangement was formally accepted by company creditors on 20 August 2010. The consortium also purchased back Selhurst Park from Lloyds Bank after a demonstration by fans put pressure on the bank to agree terms.

In December 2015, American investors Josh Harris and David Blitzer each bought an 18% stake in the club as general partners for a total of £50 million, although the stake is now estimated to be 10%. In August 2021, another American investor John Textor bought a 40% stake worth £87.5 million, increasing to 45% in 2023. Parish remains chairman with ownership around 10% equity. Robert Franco and other investors own the remaining 9%.

==Statistics and records==

Jim Cannon holds the record for the most Crystal Palace appearances in all competitions, having played 660 first-team matches between 1973 and 1988. The defender also holds the record for the most league appearances, making 571. Striker Peter Simpson holds the record for the most goals scored in a season, 54 in the 1930–31 season in Division Three (South) and is also the top scorer over a career – 165 goals between 1929 and 1935. Goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey holds the club record for most international caps.

Crystal Palace were inaugural champions of the newly formed Third Division in 1920–21, which was also their first season in the Football League and so became one of only a small group of clubs to have achieved the feat of winning a Football League Division at the first time of asking. Their average league attendance of 19,092 in the 1960–61 season and the attendance of 37,774 for the Good Friday game at Selhurst Park between Palace and Millwall the same season are Fourth Division attendance records. Palace&#x27;s official record home attendance is 51,482 for a Second Division match against Burnley on 11 May 1979. The club&#x27;s biggest victory margin in the league was the 9–0 home win against Barrow in the Fourth Division in 1959, while their heaviest defeat in the league was by the same scoreline away to Liverpool in the First Division in 1989.

The highest transfer fee received for a Crystal Palace player is £50.8 million from Bayern Munich for Michael Olise in July 2024, while the highest transfer fee paid by the club to date is £32 million for Christian Benteke from Liverpool in August 2016.

The club&#x27;s highest ever league finish so far is third place in the old Football League First Division, which is now called the Premier League, achieved in the 1990–91 season. Palace hold the record for the most points for a relegated Premier League club with 49 (although that was in a 42-game season in 1992–93). They are also the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League even though they finished fourth from bottom, as it had been decided at the end of the 1994–95 season that the bottom four clubs would be relegated in order to accommodate the league being reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the 1995–96 season; Palace&#x27;s points total that season of 45 is also the second-highest points total in Premier League history for a relegated club. Palace hold the record for the most play-off final wins (4) resulting in promotion to the top flight. Each of these play-off final wins occurred at a different location: Selhurst Park in 1989 (the first leg of the two-legged final was played at Ewood Park in Blackburn), old Wembley Stadium in 1997, Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in 2004, and new Wembley in 2013.

==In popular culture==
In the 1999 film &quot;Wonderland&quot;, the scenes of the character Dan and his son at a football match were filmed at Selhurst Park during Crystal Palace&#x27;s 1–1 draw against Birmingham City on 6 February 1999. In the stage and television play &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot;, its character Tony mentions that he used to play professionally for Crystal Palace, but it &quot;didn&#x27;t work out&quot;, something actor John Salthouse brought to the character in rehearsals based on his own life. Salthouse also incorporated the club into the children&#x27;s television series he wrote, &quot;Hero to Zero&quot;, in which the father of the main character once played for Palace reserves. In the first series of the TV Comedy &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, a Crystal Palace scarf could be seen on the coat rack, placed there by producer Ray Butt, even though its character Rodney&#x27;s middle name was Charlton, as his brother Del revealed on Rodney&#x27;s wedding day: their mother was a fan of &quot;Athletic&quot; not &quot;Heston&quot;. Headmaster Keith Blackwell, who played Palace mascot &quot;Pete the Eagle&quot; in the late nineties, fronted a series of Coca-Cola advertisements in 1996. Blackwell spoke about his role and the embarrassment it brought to his family, and clips of him in costume were used in the campaign.

The 2008 episode of &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;, &quot;Are We Not Men?&quot;, used Selhurst Park to film the crowd scenes.

The Apple TV series Ted Lasso filmed its stadium scenes at Selhurst Park.

After the Dave Clark Five performed &quot;Glad All Over&quot; at Selhurst Park in 1968, the song became synonymous with the club, and the Palace fans sing it at every match.

Crystal Palace F.C. was the subject of an Amazon Prime Video five-part series released in 2021 called &quot;When Eagles Dare&quot;, which documented the club&#x27;s 2012–13 season, when they achieved promotion to the top flight via the Championship play-offs.

The DJ and presenter of Palace TV; the official Television channel of Crystal Palace Football club, is Jay Knox.

==Crystal Palace Women==

Crystal Palace F.C. (Women) is a women&#x27;s football club founded in 1992, which is affiliated to the men&#x27;s equivalent. They currently compete in the Women&#x27;s Super League and play their home games at the VBS Community Stadium in Sutton, South London.

==Crystals cheerleaders==
The &quot;Crystals&quot; or &quot;Crystal Girls&quot; are the official cheerleading squad of Crystal Palace F.C. which is the only club in English football that has NFL-style cheerleaders. They were established in 2010 and perform before each home match and during half-time. The squad also perform at charity events as ambassadors for the club.

<doc id="385316" wikidata="Q1529051" url="?curid=385316" title="Gladesville Bridge">
<text>Gladesville Bridge is a heritage-listed concrete arch road bridge that carries Victoria Road over the Parramatta River, linking the Sydney suburbs of Huntleys Point and Drummoyne, in the local government areas of Canada Bay and Hunter&#x27;s Hill, in New South Wales, Australia. Despite its name, the bridge is not in Gladesville. 

The Gladesville Bridge is a few kilometres upstream of the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge. When it was completed in 1964, Gladesville Bridge was the longest single span concrete arch ever constructed. Gladesville Bridge is the largest of a complex of three bridges, including Fig Tree Bridge and Tarban Creek Bridge, designed to carry traffic as part of the North Western Expressway. The bridge was the first phase of this freeway project that was to connect traffic from the via /Lane Cove, then through / to connect into the city. Due to community action the freeway project was abandoned by the Wran Government in 1977, leaving the Gladesville Bridge connecting the existing arterial roads.

The Gladesville Bridge was designed by Anthony Gee, G. Maunsell &amp; Partners and Eugène Freyssinet and built from 1959 to 1964 by Reed &amp; Mallik (Engineers, England) and Stuart Bros (Builders, Sydney). The property is owned by Transport for NSW. The bridge was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 October 2014.

==History==

Europeans first settled in the Gladesville/Drummoyne area of Sydney soon after landfall at Sydney Cove. In the 1790s, Crown grants of lots were made available in the vicinity of Gladesville to encourage agricultural pursuits in the area. The future suburb of Gladesville remained isolated and rural until the 1850s when the earlier land grants were subdivided into large urban building blocks for the development of &#x27;gentlemen&#x27;s residences&#x27; for the wealthier colonists of NSW. 

===1881 bridge===

To provide better access to Sydney, a wharf was soon erected on the Parramatta River at Gladesville and a two-lane steel lattice truss girder bridge with swing span was built across the river between Drummoyne and Huntleys Point. Remnants of the sandstone abutments of the original bridge still exist on the river banks to the south-west of the present bridge. This bridge carried a tramline and road traffic but did not accommodate pedestrians. This bridge, called the Gladesville Bridge, and also known as the Parramatta River Bridge, was opened on 1 February 1881.

The old Gladesville Bridge was constructed as part of a series of bridges built during the 1880s, which also saw the construction of the Fig Tree Bridge and the Iron Cove Bridge. It was the only crossing of the Parramatta River east of Parramatta at the time of construction, with punts and ferries (steamers) providing the main methods of crossing the river. The closest crossing to the bridge was the Bedlam Punt, which operated from 1829 through to 1881 between Punt Road in the present-day Gladesville and the Great North Road in present-day . This bridge was also constructed per agitation by the community on providing a tram service from Ryde to the city.

The 1881 Gladesville Bridge was about to the west of the modern bridge. This original bridge only carried one lane of traffic in each direction as well as a tramway. It featured a swing section on the southern end of the bridge that could be opened to permit sailing ships and steamers with high funnels to pass. &#x27;Sixty miler&#x27; colliers from Newcastle would require the bridge to be opened to gain access to the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) gasworks site at , (now redeveloped as ). The bridge stood on iron cylinders with a sandstone pier at each end of the bridge. The sandstone piers are all that remain today of the original bridge, with the northern pier adjacent to the Huntleys Point ferry wharf, and the southern in Howley Park in Drummoyne.

===Current bridge===
By the 1950s, due to a rapid growth in private car ownership and road freight transport in Sydney during the interwar and post World War 2 period, the traffic crossing the old Gladesville Bridge was becoming increasingly congested. With consistent interruptions and delays from the tramline and from shipping transportation along the Parramatta River, it was soon realised that a new bridge was required to alleviate the problem.

In the late 1950s, the Department of Main Roads (DMR) intended the replacement Gladesville Bridge to be a conventional steel truss of its own design. However, an alternative approach, prepared by English civil engineering firm G. Maunsell &amp; Partners, was soon submitted by another English firm, Reed &amp; Mallik Ltd which had teamed up with Sydney-based builders Stuart Brothers. 

Civil engineer Guy Maunsell, having recently split from his professional business partners and seeking new international engineering opportunities, recognised that a concrete arch bridge would be a much better suited and economical solution for the new Gladesville Bridge than the steel truss the DMR had designed. However, winning the bridge contract was perhaps considered a long shot by the firm&#x27;s partners and scarce resources were invested into the project from the outset. The firm&#x27;s first graduate recruit, 22-year-old Anthony Gee, was given the task of developing Maunsell&#x27;s preliminary drawings into a viable design from which Reed &amp; Mallik Ltd and Stuart Brothers, could formulate a price. Due in part to the unprecedented nature of the design, the proposal was independently reviewed by internationally revered engineer, and pioneer of pre-stressed concrete methods, Eugene Freyssinet. Among the last works of Freyssinet&#x27;s life, the proposed , six-lane, high level concrete arch bridge was soon extended to , the design accepted and the contract to build was issued. 

DMR intended the new $6.3 million Gladesville Bridge to be part of the North Western Expressway, a larger program of road works that would act as a main artery to link Sydney with the northern suburbs, and through to Newcastle. Although the strategic project was finally abandoned in the 1970s, the new Gladesville Bridge started in December 1959, and took nearly five years to complete. It was officially opened by Princess Marina on 2 October 1964. The bridge was originally opened with six traffic lanes, but the extra-wide outer lanes enabled a later reconfiguration to take place. The bridge now has three northbound lanes and four southbound lanes, separated by a concrete median.

====Design and construction====
At the time when the bridge was planned, it was anticipated that extremely large vessels would need to pass underneath it in the years to come. This, as well as the topography of the site, explains why the bridge was designed with a high 61 metre (200 ft) clearance.

The construction of the new Gladesville Bridge was a noteworthy engineering achievement for its time and, being both daring and untried, its innovative design and construction set several new standards on the international stage. In many ways the construction echoed the Roman method of building arches using segmented units built over a temporary formwork. In Gladesville&#x27;s case, these were hollow precast concrete blocks which were hoisted up from barges on the river, then moved down a railway on the top of the formwork into position. Every few blocks, special inflatable rubber gaskets were inserted. When all of the blocks in the arch (there are four parallel arches altogether, not seen in the picture) were in place, the gaskets were &#x27;inflated&#x27; using synthetic hydraulic fluid, expanding the entire arch and lifting it away from the formwork to support its own weight. Once adjusted to the correct position, the gaskets were filled with liquid concrete, driving out the oil and setting to form a permanent solid arch. The formwork was then moved sideways and the next arch constructed in the same fashion. Once all four arches were erected, the deck was laid on top built from further precast concrete units. The arches bed into solid sandstone bedrock on either side of the river.

The bridge as originally tendered for this location was a rather conventional steel cantilever bridge, but one of the contractors tendered the alternative catenary arch design, recognising it was pushing the envelope of existing bridge-building knowledge. The contractor&#x27;s designer was G Maunsell &amp; Partners of London. Their alternative was accepted after submission to the famous bridge engineer Eugène Freyssinet, who approved the design with recommendations. The inflatable gasket method for example had been pioneered by Freyssinet on much earlier designs.

Gladesville Bridge was the first span concrete bridge in the world and had a substantial number of engineering and technical elements that made it a world-leading bridge design and construction achievement. It was also the first bridge, if not one of the first bridges, to utilise computer programming in its construction. As there was no suitable proprietary engineering software available at that time, the bridge designer (Anthony Gee of G. Maunsell &amp; Partners) also wrote a suite of five computer programs for analysis and detailed design to guide its construction. 

Having eclipsed Sweden&#x27;s Sando Bridge (built in 1943 at ) to become the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world, the new Gladesville Bridge was an unprecedented success that attracted world-wide attention and interest. Measuring in length, above the water level, and wide, with wide pathways on either side, the scale of the new Gladesville Bridge established it as one of the landmark engineering achievements of the world. 

In the 1970s, the roadway of Gladesville Bridge was widened from six to seven-lanes (without structural modification) to accommodate increased traffic flow. This widening was achieved by narrowing the generous width of the pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway. Aside from this, the bridge has remained relatively unchanged since its completion in 1964. 

Gladesville Bridge was named an Engineering Heritage International Marker upon its 50th anniversary on 1 October 2014; and was named an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark on 15 December 2015.

== Description == 
The Gladesville Bridge connects the suburbs of Gladesville (located on the northern bank of the Parramatta River) and Drummoyne (located on its southern and eastern sides). Gladesville Bridge is a four-box pre-stressed concrete arch with a span of . Its total length (including approaches) is . The roadway across the bridge is includes seven roadway lanes with pathway on either side. 

The arch of the bridge is supported by concrete thrust blocks embedded into sandstone foundations on either side of Parramatta River. The bridge was constructed as four arches, each made from precast concrete box sections. Each rib of blocks was erected on a falsework system supported on piles. When the four arches were in place, they were stressed together (using the Freyssinet stressing system) by transverse cables passing through diaphragms. 

On completion of the arch, the piers (stressed vertically using the Lee McCall system) were constructed on both the arch and approaches. These supported the deck which is a waffle construction of eight longitudinal pre-cast and pre-stressed &quot;T&quot; beams with four intermediate cast-in-place transverse beams per span, and with cast in place fillers between the &quot;T&quot; beams. At its northern end, the deck flares out from its six lanes to accommodate the diverging traffic lanes feeding both Victoria Road and Burns Bay Road. 

Gladesville Bridge is the furthest east (downstream) of the crossings on Parramatta River. A short distance further east, Parramatta River enters Port Jackson, and the next crossing on Port Jackson is Sydney Harbour Bridge.

=== Condition === 
Still in active operation and serving heavy inner-city road traffic on a daily basis, the Gladesville Bridge appears to be in good physical condition due to regular maintenance works. 

=== Modifications and dates === 
In the 1970s, the roadway of Gladesville Bridge was widened from six to seven-lanes (without structural modification) to accommodate an increased traffic flow over the bridge. This widening was achieved by taking in some of the generous width of the pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway. Fencing along the north eastern side of the Gladesville Bridge appears to have been a later addition.

===Bicycle and pedestrian access===
The bridge has a footpath on both sides of the bridge. The path on the west side is under a metre wide, much too narrow to cycle on. The path on the east side is listed as a shared cycle path, but it is also only wide bound between a low barrier with a steel hand rail on the road side and a fence on the drop side. These barriers make the effective path approximately wide for two way cycle and pedestrian traffic.

Access from the northern end is via a pedestrian tunnel off Huntleys Point Road, directly under the bridge, with stairs. The bridge is not wheelchair accessible.

== Heritage listing == 

As at 19 December 2013, Gladesville Bridge has state heritage significance as the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world at the time of its completion in 1964, being . One of only two of its type in NSW, Gladesville Bridge is considered to be a leading example of technical and engineering achievement on the international stage. An innovative design that set new global standards for design and construction, Gladesville Bridge was one of the first bridges in the world (if not, the first) to utilise computer programming in its construction. With particular social significance and an important association with a number of internationally acclaimed engineers and engineering firms (including G. Maunsell &amp; Partners and Eugene Freyssinet), Gladesville Bridge is one of the landmark engineering achievements of the world. Gladesville Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 October 2014 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. 

Gladesville Bridge has state heritage significance as the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world at the time of its completion in 1964 (at 1000 feet, this record was held for 15 years until 1980). Considered to be a leading example of technical and engineering achievement, the Gladesville Bridge was an innovative design that set new standards for design and construction on the international stage. One of the landmark engineering achievements of the world, Gladesville Bridge was one of the first bridges in the world (if not, the first) to utilise computer programming in its construction. 

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history. 

Gladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its association with a number of internationally acclaimed engineers and engineering firms. Designed by English firm G. Maunsell &amp; Partners, the vision of the new Gladesville Bridge being a concrete arch bridge, rather than a more standard steel truss bridge, is attributed to Guy Maunsell. Maunsell was a revered British engineer and early developer of pre-stressed concrete. In the mid-20th century, at the time of the construction of Gladesville Bridge, G. Maunsell &amp; Partners were applying their creative methods to building iconic bridges across the world. Gladesville Bridge is also associated with the celebrated French engineer, Eugene Freyssinet who reviewed the innovative and unprecedented design. A pioneer in using pre-stressed concrete in bridge construction, Freyssinet&#x27;s contribution to the design of Gladesville Bridge was among the last works of his life. 

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.
Gladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its aesthetic and technical significance. Upon its construction in 1964, Gladesville Bridge was the longest concrete arch span bridge in the world and its innovative design set new standards for design and construction on the international stage. An internationally leading example of technical and engineering achievement, Gladesville Bridge was considered to be one of the landmark engineering achievements of the world. Built in an era when aesthetic qualities were given high priority, particularly on high-profile infrastructure projects, Gladesville Bridge is an impressive and visually distinctive structure that serves as an inner-city landmark from the road and river. 

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. 

Gladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its social value to the community of NSW. The replacement of the 1881 Gladesville Bridge, and the development of the unrealised North-Western Expressway, was a major Department of Main Roads project that was instigated by, and responded directly to, the demands of the Sydney community. The crossing of Parramatta River at this point was considered to be a critical connection between the city and the northern suburbs. A critical link in the planned expressway to Newcastle, the new Gladesville Bridge was to alleviate traffic congestion and provide better access for the new residential suburbs and communities that were developing in the post-war period. Today, Gladesville Bridge is a landmark structure that continues to be a major arterial roadway servicing the Sydney community. 

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 

Gladesville Bridge has state heritage significance for its technical significance and, as such, may have potential to reveal information about its world-class standards of design and construction that led to the structure being considered a leading example of technical and engineering achievement. 

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 

Gladesville Bridge has state heritage significance as a rare example of a concrete arch span bridge in NSW. Gladesville Bridge is one of only two of its type in the state-the other is the nearby Tarban Creek Bridge which is a 300-foot bridge, built in 1965 as part of the same unrealised North-Western Expressway project that was also responsible for the construction of Gladesville Bridge. Although both were built by the same team, both Gladesville Bridge and Tarban Creek Bridge are distinctly different in their structural specifications and construction methods. The longest concrete arch span bridge in the world upon its construction (a record held for 15 years), Gladesville Bridge is now the seventh longest bridge of its type (in excess of 1000 feet) in the world. Eclipsed by the1280 foot Krk Bridge in Croatia (built in 1980), Gladesville Bridge continues to be the longest concrete arch span bridge in Australia. 

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. 

Gladesville Bridge is a representative example of the technological advancement of bridge design and construction in NSW. From the peak of the arch, one can witness the evolution of bridge engineering in Sydney - from the Sydney Harbour Bridge (1932), to the Gladesville Bridge (1964) to the Anzac Bridge (1995). Replacing an earlier 1881 swing bridge and ferry service, Gladesville Bridge is also a representative example of a critical transport crossing across the Parramatta River.

== Engineering heritage awards ==
The bridge received an Engineering Heritage International Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program and was designated as an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

<doc id="385319" wikidata="Q491713" url="?curid=385319" title="Sound (geography)">
<text>In geography, a sound is a smaller body of water usually connected to a sea or an ocean. A &quot;sound&quot; may be an inlet that is deeper than a bight and wider than a fjord; or a narrow sea channel or an ocean channel between two land masses, such as a strait; or also a lagoon between a barrier island and the mainland.

==Overview==

A sound is often formed by the seas flooding a river valley. This produces a long inlet where the sloping valley hillsides descend to sea-level and continue beneath the water to form a sloping sea floor. These sounds are more appropriately called rias. The Marlborough Sounds in New Zealand are good examples of this type of formation.

Sometimes a sound is produced by a glacier carving out a valley on a coast then receding, or the sea invading a glacier valley. The glacier produces a sound that often has steep, near vertical sides that extend deep underwater. The sea floor is often flat and deeper at the landward end than the seaward end, due to glacial moraine deposits. This type of sound is more properly termed a fjord (or fiord). The sounds in Fiordland, New Zealand, have been formed this way.

A sound generally connotes a protected anchorage. It can be part of most large islands.

In the more general northern European usage, a sound is a strait or the narrowest part of a strait. In Scandinavia and around the Baltic Sea, there are more than a hundred straits named &quot;Sund&quot;, mostly named for the island they separate from the continent or a larger island.

In contrast, &quot;the&quot; Sound is the common international short name for Øresund, the narrow stretch of water that separates Denmark and Sweden, and is the main waterway between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. It is also a colloquial short name, among others, for Plymouth Sound, England.

In areas explored by the British in the late 18th century, particularly the northwest coast of North America, the term &quot;sound&quot; was applied to inlets containing large islands, such as Howe Sound in British Columbia and Puget Sound in the U.S. state of Washington. It was also applied to bodies of open water not fully open to the ocean, such as Caamaño Sound or Queen Charlotte Sound in Canada; or broadenings or mergings at the openings of inlets, like Cross Sound in Alaska and Fitz Hugh Sound in British Columbia.
Along the east coast and Gulf Coast of the United States, a number of bodies of water that separate islands from the mainland are called &quot;sounds&quot;. Long Island Sound separates Long Island from the eastern shores of the Bronx, Westchester County, and southern Connecticut. Similarly, in North Carolina, a number of large lagoons lie between the mainland and its barrier beaches, the Outer Banks. These include Pamlico Sound, Albemarle Sound, Bogue Sound, and several others. The Mississippi Sound separates the Gulf of Mexico from the mainland, along much of the gulf coasts of Alabama and Mississippi.

==Etymology==
The term sound is derived from the Anglo-Saxon or Old Norse word &quot;sund&quot;, which also means &quot;swimming&quot;.

The word &quot;sund&quot; is also documented in Old Norse and Old English as meaning &quot;gap&quot; (or &quot;narrow access&quot;). This suggests a relation to verbs meaning &quot;to separate&quot;, such as &quot;absondern&quot; and &quot;aussondern&quot; (German), &quot;söndra&quot; (Swedish), &quot;sondre&quot; (Norwegian), as well as the English noun &quot;sin&quot;, German &quot;Sünde&quot; (&quot;apart from God&#x27;s law&quot;), and Swedish &quot;synd&quot;. English has also the adjective &quot;asunder&quot; and the noun &quot;sundry&#x27;, and Swedish has the adjective &quot;sönder&quot; (&quot;broken&quot;).

In Swedish and in both Norwegian languages, &quot;sund&quot; is the general term for any strait. In Danish, Swedish and Nynorsk, it is even part of names worldwide, such as in Swedish &quot;Berings sund&quot; and &quot;Gibraltar sund&quot;, and in Nynorsk &quot;Beringsundet&quot; and &quot;Gibraltarsundet&quot;. In German &quot;Sund&quot; is mainly used for place names in the Baltic Sea, like Fehmarnsund, Strelasund, and Stralsund.

<text>Sven Joakim Eriksson Thåström (born 20 March 1957), better known as Thåström, is a Swedish singer and songwriter, mostly known for the bands Ebba Grön and Imperiet. He has moved between a number of genres, from punk to rock, industrial and autobiographical singer-songwriter music.

==Life and career==
===Early career and Ebba Grön===
Thåström grew up on Skebokvarnsvägen in Högdalen, south of Stockholm. He formed his first band &quot;Helt sonika&quot; with Thomas Svanljung, Lars Elffors, Lennart &quot;Elton&quot; Hellgren, Bosse Steinholtz and Lars Bremer. The band played around Stockholm in youth centers, clubs and outdoor festivals. Lennart Eriksson (or Fjodor as he was known) lived in Rågsved. Together with Gunnar &quot;Gurra&quot; Ljungstedt, they formed a band first called The Haters. The Haters changed their name after only three days to Ebba Grön, which originates from a police code in connection with the so-called Operation Leo, where the German terrorist Norbert Kröcher planned to kidnap the Swedish Minister for Immigration Anna-Greta Leijon. &quot;Ebba röd&quot; was the police code of the operation to arrest Kröcher. When the arrest was accomplished the police called out &quot;Ebba grön&quot; on the radio. Thåström was the singer and guitarist of punk band Ebba Grön from 1977 to 1983.

===1982–1989: Rymdimperiet and Imperiet===
When Ebba Grön went in hiatus in 1981 due to bassist Lennart &quot;Fjodor&quot; Eriksson having to serve time in jail for refusing military service, the three remaining members (Thåström, drummer Gunnar &quot;Gurra&quot; Ljungstedt and keyboardist Anders &quot;Stry Terrarie&quot; Sjöblom) formed side-project &quot;Rymdimperiet&quot; (&quot;Galactic Empire&quot;).

When Ebba Grön officially disbanded in 1983, Rymdimperiet was renamed Imperiet (&quot;The Empire&quot;). With a then-modern sound firmly set in the 80s and a more focused leftist political stance combined with easily accessible songs, Imperiet became one of the biggest Swedish bands of the 1980s.

In an attempt to cross over to international audiences, Imperiet also recorded an album with some of their songs translated to English.

===1989–1997: First solo releases and Peace Love &amp; Pitbulls===
In 1989 Thåström started a solo career as a rock singer-songwriter with progg influences. He began his solo career with the release of two solo albums, the self-titled &#x27;Thåström&#x27; in 1989 and then &quot;Xplodera mig 2000&quot; (&quot;Xplode Me 2000&quot;) in 1991. The later was extremely computer-based and led to the development of the band Peace Love &amp; Pitbulls.

In 1992, he started the heavy industrial rock band Peace Love &amp; Pitbulls, with lyrics in English. The band existed until 1997 and released three studio albums.

===1999–2005: Focus on solo career===
The Swedish audience longed for a new rock album so when Thåström in 1999 released the album &quot;Det är ni som e dom konstiga, det är jag som e normal&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re the Strange Ones, I am the One Who&#x27;s Normal&quot;) it became a very big success. Once again with Swedish lyrics and less computerized music Thåström had gone back to his original rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll-roots.

In 2002 Thåström released the album &quot;Mannen som blev en gris&quot; (&quot;The Man Who Became a Pig&quot;) which was a dark and &#x27;filthy&#x27; album with a lot of dusty sounds.

In late 2005 Thåström released the album &quot;Skebokvarnsv. 209&quot; (&quot;Skebokvarn Street 209&quot;). The title refers to Thåström&#x27;s childhood home address. The album is the most biographical album Thåström has ever released. It contains several songs with extremely personal lyrics and the music is mostly based on acoustic guitars.

===2007–present: Sällskapet and recent work===
In 2007, Thåström presented a new band called &quot;Sällskapet&quot;. The band had been kept a secret since 2003 and was revealed together with their self-titled debut album. Sällskapet is commonly seen upon as a one time thing and in 2008 Thåström announced that he&#x27;s working on a new solo album and that he is going to share two shows with the Swedish band &quot;Kent&quot;, play at the Peace &amp; Love-festival in Borlänge and also play at the Beatday-festival in Copenhagen in the beginning of August.

On 13 March 2009 he released a new album called &quot;Kärlek är för dom&quot; (&quot;Love is for them [or those]&quot;).

On 15 February 2012 his seventh album was released, &quot;Beväpna dig med vingar&quot; (&quot;Arm yourself with wings&quot;), and he went on tour in Sweden supporting this release. A large portion of the proceeds from the merchandise sold on this tour was donated to the cause of the homeless people in Sweden. In November that year, Thåström released his first live-DVD: &quot;Som jordgubbarna smakade...&quot;.

Thåström released &quot;Den Morronen&quot; (&quot;That Morning&quot;) 2015.

In 2017, he released his ninth album &quot;Centralmassivet&quot; (&quot;The Massif Central&quot;).

In 2021 he released his tenth album entitled &quot;Dom som skiner&quot; (&quot;Those who beam&quot;) to critical acclaim.

<text>Jean Louisa Kelly (born March 9, 1972) is an American actress and singer. After making her film debut as Tia Russell in &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989) alongside John Candy, she appeared in a wide range of other films including &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; (1995) and &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot; (1995). From 2000 to 2006, she portrayed Kim Warner on the CBS sitcom &quot;Yes, Dear&quot;.

==Career==
Her first professional paying job was as a kid, starring in &quot;Annie&quot; at the Theater by the Sea in Mantunuck, Rhode Island. She reprised her &quot;Annie&quot; role the following summer at the Candlewood Playhouse in Fairfield, Connecticut. Before attending college, she already had roles in the original Broadway cast of Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (as Snow White) at the age of 15 and understudy to Rapunzel and Little Red Ridinghood, and as Tia Russell in the film &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; with John Candy. She also took roles in college productions, including with the Barnard College Gilbert and Sullivan Society.

In the mid-1990s, after graduating from Columbia University, Kelly became well known for a series of television commercials she did for MCI long distance, in which she played a telephone operator who challenged AT&amp;T. In 1995, she starred as Luisa in the musical film &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; with Joey McIntyre and Joel Grey, although the film was shelved until 2000. The same year, she appeared as Rowena Morgan, the muse for the title character of &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot;; she was cast while the movie was already in production, replacing another actress. 

In the 1990s, other films followed, including &quot;Origin of the Species,&quot; &quot;The Day Lincoln was Shot&quot; and &quot;Landfall&quot; (2001). Kelly appeared Off Broadway at the York Theatre in the title role in Paul McKibbins and B.T. McNicholl&#x27;s &quot;The It Girl&quot;, based on the 1927 movie &quot;It&quot;. She also appeared in the York&#x27;s &quot;Musicals in Mufti&quot; series as Lois Lane in &quot;It&#x27;s a Bird, It&#x27;s a Plane, It&#x27;s Superman&quot;.

In 1996, Kelly voiced the title role in the second season of the animated series &quot;Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders&quot;. After several made-for-TV movies, Kelly&#x27;s broadest exposure came from her roles in situation comedies, first guest starring in such shows as &quot;Mad About You&quot;, and then as a cast member of the short-lived NBC version of &quot;Cold Feet&quot;. From 2000 to 2006, she starred as Kim Warner on the long-running sitcom &quot;Yes, Dear&quot;. In 2006 she guest starred in the ABC drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. After her series ended, she guest starred on numerous television shows and starred in movies of the week. She recurred as Bernice Pope in the Yahoo production of &quot;Sin City Saints&quot;.

She played opposite William Fichtner in the movie &quot;The Neighbor&quot; and opposite John Diehl in &quot;Out of the Wild&quot; in 2015. In 2019 she played opposite Bradley Whitford in &quot;Call of the Wild,&quot; and played Jane Doe/Serena May in the James Wan movie &quot;Malignant.&quot;

She released an album of children&#x27;s music called &quot;Color of Your Heart&quot; in 2013. In 2015, she released a five-song EP called &quot;Willing&quot;, and in 2017 she released an album titled &quot;For My Folks&quot;, which features a collection of standards.

Kelly appears as Sarah Kazansky - wife of Val Kilmer&#x27;s character Tom &quot;Iceman&quot; Kazansky - in the 2022 action drama movie &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kelly was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, the daughter of J. Joseph Kelly III and Wendy Kelly. Her father was a high school English teacher, and her mother taught piano. She grew up on Linden Street, off Central Street, in Boylston, MA, eventually moving to Maryland when she was a junior in high school, and attended Easton High School in Easton, Maryland. In 1994, Kelly graduated from Columbia University&#x27;s Columbia College with a Bachelor of Arts in English.

<text>The Porsche 64, also known as the Type 64 and Type 60K10, is considered by many to be the first automobile from what was to become the Porsche company, and a true design precursor to the post-war production model. 
==History==
===Name and origin===
The model number comes from the fact that it was built mainly from design drawings for the Type-64 &quot;record car&quot;. Most mechanical parts came from the VW 38, the prototype of the KdF-Wagen better known as the Volkswagen Beetle. The chassis was heavily reinforced and the engine also reworked to produce around 40 horsepower. The Type 64 was only a drawing until the three racers were built. The body was also a compromise in that the cab had to look like a KdF car, but the rest was &#x27;record&#x27; car. The VW beetle was the Type 60, and the name the &quot;60K10&quot; means body design 10 for the Type 60 Beetle. Its flat-four engine produced between 32 and 40 bhp and gave a top speed of around .
===Planned races and scrapping===
The body design was made by the Porsche Büro after wind tunnel tests for a planned V10 sports car that never came into existence, the Type 114. Dr. Ingr. Porsche promoted the idea to enter the car into the Berlin-Rome race scheduled for September 1939. The race did not take place but three cars were completed, with aluminium bodies hand shaped by the bodywork company Reutter (which also produced the VW 38 prototypes). One of these, the 38/41, was destroyed early in World War II. The two remaining cars, numbered 38/42 and 38/43, were used by the Porsche family. Eventually they only used one of them and put the other in storage.

===Last examples===
In May 1945, American troops discovered the one put in storage, cut the roof off and used it for joyriding for a few weeks until the engine gave up and it was scrapped. The last remaining Porsche 64 was owned by Ferry Porsche who had it restored by Battista Farina in 1947. In 1949 it was sold to the Austrian motorcycle racer and with it he won the Alpine Rally in 1950. The last time he drove it in a race was at the Monterey Historic Automobile Races in Monterey, California, in 1982. The scrapped car, chassis 38/42, has also been rebuilt and is now on display in the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.

Otto Mathé retained possession of 38/43 until his death in 1995, and two years later the Type 64 was sold for the second time in its history to Porsche collector and marque expert Dr. Thomas Gruber of Vienna, Austria. The 1939 Porsche Type 64, was to be auctioned in August 2019 during Monterey Car Week. RM Sotheby&#x27;s predicted a selling price “in excess of $20 million” but it failed to sell at an auction marred by incorrectly displayed bid amounts.

<text>This is a list of known and hypothesized microscopic particles in particle physics, condensed matter physics and cosmology.

== Standard Model elementary particles ==
Elementary particles are particles with no measurable internal structure; that is, it is unknown whether they are composed of other particles. They are the fundamental objects of quantum field theory. Many families and sub-families of elementary particles exist. Elementary particles are classified according to their spin. Fermions have half-integer spin while bosons have integer spin. All the particles of the Standard Model have been experimentally observed, including the Higgs boson in 2012. Many other hypothetical elementary particles, such as the graviton, have been proposed, but not observed experimentally.
=== Fermions ===
Fermions are one of the two fundamental classes of particles, the other being bosons. Fermion particles are described by Fermi–Dirac statistics and have quantum numbers described by the Pauli exclusion principle. They include the quarks and leptons, as well as any composite particles consisting of an odd number of these, such as all baryons and many atoms and nuclei.

Fermions have half-integer spin; for all known elementary fermions this is . All known fermions except neutrinos, are also Dirac fermions; that is, each known fermion has its own distinct antiparticle. It is not known whether the neutrino is a Dirac fermion or a Majorana fermion. Fermions are the basic building blocks of all matter. They are classified according to whether they interact via the strong interaction or not. In the Standard Model, there are 12 types of elementary fermions: six quarks and six leptons.

==== Quarks ====
Quarks are the fundamental constituents of hadrons and interact via the strong force. Quarks are the only known carriers of fractional charge, but because they combine in groups of three quarks (baryons) or in pairs of one quark and one antiquark (mesons), only integer charge is observed in nature. Their respective antiparticles are the antiquarks, which are identical except that they carry the opposite electric charge (for example the up quark carries charge +, while the up antiquark carries charge −), color charge, and baryon number. There are six flavors of quarks; the three positively charged quarks are called &quot;up-type quarks&quot; while the three negatively charged quarks are called &quot;down-type quarks&quot;.

==== Leptons ====
Leptons do not interact via the strong interaction. Their respective antiparticles are the antileptons, which are identical, except that they carry the opposite electric charge and lepton number. The antiparticle of an electron is an antielectron, which is almost always called a &quot;positron&quot; for historical reasons. There are six leptons in total; the three charged leptons are called &quot;electron-like leptons&quot;, while the neutral leptons are called &quot;neutrinos&quot;. Neutrinos are known to oscillate, so that neutrinos of definite flavor do not have definite mass: Instead, they exist in a superposition of mass eigenstates. The hypothetical heavy right-handed neutrino, called a &quot;sterile neutrino&quot;, has been omitted.


=== Bosons ===
Bosons are one of the two fundamental particles having integral spinclasses of particles, the other being fermions. Bosons are characterized by Bose–Einstein statistics and all have integer spins. Bosons may be either elementary, like photons and gluons, or composite, like mesons.

According to the Standard Model, the elementary bosons are:

The Higgs boson is postulated by the electroweak theory primarily to explain the origin of particle masses. In a process known as the &quot;Higgs mechanism&quot;, the Higgs boson and the other gauge bosons in the Standard Model acquire mass via spontaneous symmetry breaking of the SU(2) gauge symmetry. The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) predicts several Higgs bosons. On 4 July 2012, the discovery of a new particle with a mass between was announced; physicists suspected that it was the Higgs boson. Since then, the particle has been shown to behave, interact, and decay in many of the ways predicted for Higgs particles by the Standard Model, as well as having even parity and zero spin, two fundamental attributes of a Higgs boson. This also means it is the first elementary scalar particle discovered in nature.

Elementary bosons responsible for the four fundamental forces of nature are called force particles (gauge bosons). The strong interaction is mediated by the gluon, the weak interaction is mediated by the W and Z bosons, electromagnetism by the photon, and gravity by the graviton, which is still hypothetical.

== Composite particles ==

Composite particles are bound states of elementary particles.

=== Hadrons ===
Hadrons are defined as strongly interacting composite particles. Hadrons are either:
* Composite fermions (especially 3 quarks), in which case they are called baryons.
* Composite bosons (especially 2 quarks), in which case they are called mesons.

Quark models, first proposed in 1964 independently by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig (who called quarks &quot;aces&quot;), describe the known hadrons as composed of valence quarks and/or antiquarks, tightly bound by the color force, which is mediated by gluons. (The interaction between quarks and gluons is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.) A &quot;sea&quot; of virtual quark-antiquark pairs is also present in each hadron.

==== Baryons ====


Ordinary baryons (composite fermions) contain three valence quarks or three valence antiquarks each.
* Nucleons are the fermionic constituents of normal atomic nuclei:
** Protons, composed of two up and one down quark (uud)
** Neutrons, composed of two down and one up quark (ddu)
* Hyperons, such as the Λ, Σ, Ξ, and Ω particles, which contain one or more strange quarks, are short-lived and heavier than nucleons. Although not normally present in atomic nuclei, they can appear in short-lived hypernuclei.
* A number of charmed and bottom baryons have also been observed.
* Pentaquarks consist of four valence quarks and one valence antiquark.
* Other exotic baryons may also exist.

==== Mesons ====

Ordinary mesons are made up of a valence quark and a valence antiquark. Because mesons have integer spin (0 or 1) and are not themselves elementary particles, they are classified as &quot;composite&quot; bosons, although being made of elementary fermions. Examples of mesons include the pion, kaon, and the J/ψ. In quantum hadrodynamics, mesons mediate the residual strong force between nucleons.

At one time or another, positive signatures have been reported for all of the following exotic mesons but their existences have yet to be confirmed.
* A tetraquark consists of two valence quarks and two valence antiquarks;
* A glueball is a bound state of gluons with no valence quarks;
* Hybrid mesons consist of one or more valence quark–antiquark pairs and one or more real gluons.

=== Atomic nuclei ===

Atomic nuclei typically consist of protons and neutrons, although exotic nuclei may consist of other baryons, such as hypertriton which contains a hyperon. These baryons (protons, neutrons, hyperons, etc.) which comprise the nucleus are called nucleons. Each type of nucleus is called a &quot;nuclide&quot;, and each nuclide is defined by the specific number of each type of nucleon.
* &quot;Isotopes&quot; are nuclides which have the same number of protons but differing numbers of neutrons.
* Conversely, &quot;isotones&quot; are nuclides which have the same number of neutrons but differing numbers of protons.
* &quot;Isobars&quot; are nuclides which have the same total number of nucleons but which differ in the number of each type of nucleon. Nuclear reactions can change one nuclide into another.

=== Atoms ===

Atoms are the smallest neutral particles into which matter can be divided by chemical reactions. An atom consists of a small, heavy nucleus surrounded by a relatively large, light cloud of electrons. An atomic nucleus consists of 1 or more protons and 0 or more neutrons. Protons and neutrons are, in turn, made of quarks. Each type of atom corresponds to a specific chemical element. To date, 118 elements have been discovered or created.

Exotic atoms may be composed of particles in addition to or in place of protons, neutrons, and electrons, such as hyperons or muons. Examples include pionium () and quarkonium atoms.

==== Leptonic atoms ====
Leptonic atoms, named using -onium, are exotic atoms constituted by the bound state of a lepton and an antilepton. Examples of such atoms include positronium (), muonium (), and &quot;true muonium&quot; (). Of these positronium and muonium have been experimentally observed, while &quot;true muonium&quot; remains only theoretical.

=== Molecules ===

Molecules are the smallest particles into which a substance can be divided while maintaining the chemical properties of the substance. Each type of molecule corresponds to a specific chemical substance. A molecule is a composite of two or more atoms. Atoms are combined in a fixed proportion to form a molecule. Molecule is one of the most basic units of matter.

=== Ions ===
Ions are charged atoms (monatomic ions) or molecules (polyatomic ions). They include cations which have a net positive charge, and anions which have a net negative charge.

===Other categories===
* Goldstone bosons are a massless excitation of a field that has been spontaneously broken. The pions are quasi-goldstone bosons (quasi- because they are not exactly massless) of the broken chiral isospin symmetry of quantum chromodynamics.
* Parton, is a generic term coined by Feynman for the sub-particles making up a composite particle – at that time a baryon – hence, it originally referred to what are now called &quot;quarks&quot; and &quot;gluons&quot;.
* Odderon, a particle composed of an odd number of gluons, detected in 2021.

== Quasiparticles ==

Quasiparticles are effective particles that exist in many particle systems. The field equations of condensed matter physics are remarkably similar to those of high energy particle physics. As a result, much of the theory of particle physics applies to condensed matter physics as well; in particular, there are a selection of field excitations, called quasi-particles, that can be created and explored. These include:
* Anyons are a generalization of fermions and bosons in two-dimensional systems like sheets of graphene that obeys braid statistics.
* Excitons are bound states of an electron and a hole.
* Magnons are coherent excitations of electron spins in a material.
* Phonons are vibrational modes in a crystal lattice.
* Plasmons are coherent excitations of a plasma.
* Polaritons are mixtures of photons with other quasi-particles.
* Polarons are moving, charged (quasi-) particles that are surrounded by ions in a material.

== Hypothetical particles ==

=== Graviton ===

The graviton is a hypothetical particle that has been included in some extensions to the Standard Model to mediate the gravitational force. It is in a peculiar category between known and hypothetical particles: As an unobserved particle that is not predicted by, nor required for the Standard Model, it belongs in the table of hypothetical particles. But gravitational force itself is a certainty, and expressing that known force in the framework of a quantum field theory requires a boson to mediate it.

If it exists, the graviton is expected to be massless because the gravitational force has a very long range, and appears to propagate at the speed of light. The graviton must be a spin-2 boson because the source of gravitation is the stress–energy tensor, a second-order tensor (compared with electromagnetism&#x27;s spin-1 photon, the source of which is the four-current, a first-order tensor). Additionally, it can be shown that any massless spin-2 field would give rise to a force indistinguishable from gravitation, because a massless spin-2 field would couple to the stress–energy tensor in the same way that gravitational interactions do. This result suggests that, if a massless spin-2 particle is discovered, it must be the graviton.

=== Dark matter candidates ===

Many hypothetical particle candidates for dark matter have been proposed like weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP), weakly interacting slender particles or a feebly interacting particles (FIP).

=== Dark energy candidates ===
Hypothetical particle candidates to explain dark energy include the chameleon particle and the acceleron.

== Auxiliary particles ==
Virtual particles are mathematical tools used in calculations that exhibits some of the characteristics of an ordinary particle but do not obey the mass-shell relation. These particles are unphysical and unobservable. These include:

* Ghost particles, like Faddeev–Popov ghosts and Pauli–Villars ghosts
* Spurions, auxiliary field in a quantum field theory that can be used to parameterize any symmetry 
* Soft photons, photons with energies below detectable in experiment.

There are also instantons are field configurations which are a local minimum of the Yang–Mills field equation. Instantons are used in nonperturbative calculations of tunneling rates. Instantons have properties similar to particles, specific examples include:
*Calorons, finite temperature generalization of instantons.
*Merons, a field configuration which is a non-self-dual solution of the Yang–Mills field equation. The instanton is believed to be composed of two merons.
*Sphalerons are a field configuration which is a saddle point of the Yang–Mills field equations. Sphalerons are used in nonperturbative calculations of non-tunneling rates.
*Renormalons, a possible type of singularity arising when using Borel summation. It is a counterpart of an instanton singularity.

== Classification by speed ==
* A bradyon (or tardyon) travels slower than the speed of light in vacuum and has a non-zero, real rest mass.
* A luxon travels as fast as light in vacuum and has no rest mass.
* A tachyon is a hypothetical particle that travels faster than the speed of light so they would paradoxically experience time in reverse (due to inversion of the theory of relativity) and would violate the known laws of causality. A tachyon has an imaginary rest mass.

<doc id="385335" wikidata="Q3570117" url="?curid=385335" title="Writ of assistance">
<text>A writ of assistance is a written order (a writ) issued by a court instructing a law enforcement official, such as a sheriff or a tax collector, to perform a certain task. Historically, several types of writs have been called &quot;writs of assistance&quot;. Most often, a writ of assistance is &quot;used to enforce an order for the possession of lands&quot;. When used to evict someone from real property, such a writ is also called a &quot;writ of restitution&quot; or a &quot;writ of possession&quot;. In the area of customs, writs of assistance date from Colonial times. They were issued by the Court of Exchequer to help customs officials search for smuggled goods. These writs were called &quot;writs of assistance&quot; because they called upon sheriffs, other officials, and loyal subjects to &quot;assist&quot; the customs official in carrying out his duties.

In general, customs writs of assistance served as general search warrants that did not expire, allowing customs officials to search anywhere for smuggled goods without having to obtain a specific warrant. These writs became controversial when they were issued by courts in British America between 1755 and 1760 (then mirroring like writs having previously been issued, and being enforced, in the motherland by Britain&#x27;s Exchequer Court), especially the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Controversy over these general writs of assistance inspired the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids general search warrants in the United States of America. Though generally these colonial writs were no more onerous than the ones enforced in Britain, a fallacious 1760 &quot;London Magazine&quot; article asserted the writs issued in the motherland &quot;...were &quot;specific&quot;, not &quot;general&quot;&quot; thereby generating the perception in the colonies that the colonists were being treated unfairly. John Adams was to later assert that the ensuing court battle was the &quot;seeds of the American Revolution.&quot;

==In colonial America==
General writs of assistance played an important role in the increasing tensions that led to the American Revolution and the creation of the United States of America. In 1760, Great Britain began to enforce some of the provisions of the Navigation Acts by granting customs officers these writs. In New England, smuggling had become common. However, officers could not search a person&#x27;s property without giving a reason. Colonists protested that the writs violated their rights as British subjects.

Among the grounds for which the colonists opposed the writs were that they were permanent and even transferable; the holder of a writ could assign it to another; any place could be searched at the whim of the holder; and searchers were not responsible for any damage they caused.

All writs of assistance expired six months after the death of the king, at which time new writs had to be obtained. With the death of King George II on 25 October 1760, all writs would expire on 25 April 1761. The crisis began on 27 December 1760 when news of King George II&#x27;s death reached Boston and the people of Massachusetts learned that all writs faced termination.

===Paxton&#x27;s case===
Within three weeks, the writs were challenged by a group of 63 Boston merchants represented by fiery Boston attorney James Otis Jr. A countersuit was filed by a British customs agent Paxton, and together these are known as &quot;Paxton&#x27;s case&quot;. Otis argued the famous writs of assistance case at the Old State House in Boston in February 1761 and again on 16 November 1761. Otis gave the speech of his life, making references to liberty, English common law, &quot;a man&#x27;s house is his castle,&quot; and the colonists&#x27;s &quot;rights as Englishmen.&quot;

The court ruled against the merchants. However, Otis&#x27;s arguments were published in the colonies, and stirred widespread support for colonial rights. As a young lawyer John Adams observed the case in the packed courtroom. Moved by Otis&#x27;s performance and legal arguments, he later declared that &quot;Then and there the child Independence was born&quot;.

In a pamphlet published in 1765, Otis expanded his argument that the general writs violated the British unwritten constitution hearkening back to the Magna Carta. Any law in violation of the constitution or &quot;natural law&quot; which underlay it, he said, was void.

===Malcom Affair===
A writ of assistance was used in an incident known as the &quot;Malcom Affair&quot;, which was described by legal scholar William Cuddihy as &quot;the most famous search in colonial America.&quot; The episode demonstrated a fundamental difference between the colonists&#x27; view of their rights and the official British view of imperial law. &quot;The Malcom affair was a minor matter, a comedy of blundering revenue officers and barricaded colonials,&quot; wrote legal historian John Phillip Reid, &quot;but were we to dismiss it in haste we might run the risk of dismissing much of the story of the American Revolution.&quot;

On 24 September 1766, customs officials in Boston, with a deputy sheriff, searched merchant Daniel Malcom&#x27;s home, which was also his place of business. They claimed the authority to do so by a writ of assistance issued to customs official Benjamin Hallowell, and the information of a confidential informant. Malcom allowed them to search, but denied them access to a locked cellar, arguing that they did not have the legal authority to break it open. According to customs officials, Malcom threatened to use force to prevent them from opening the door; according to Malcom and his supporters, his threat specified resisting any &quot;unlawful&quot; forced entry.

The officials left and returned with a specific search warrant, only to find that Malcom had locked his house. A crowd supportive of Malcom had gathered around the house; Tories claimed that this &quot;mob&quot; numbered 300 or more people and was hostile to the customs officers, while Whigs insisted that this was a peaceful gathering of about 50 curious onlookers, mostly boys. No violence occurred, but reports written by Governor Francis Bernard and the customs officials created the impression in Britain that a riot had taken place. The incident furthered Boston&#x27;s reputation in Britain as a lawless town controlled by &quot;mobs&quot;, a reputation that would contribute to the government&#x27;s decision to send troops in 1768.

Although British officials, and some historians, described Malcom as acting in defiance of the law, the constitutional historian John Phillip Reid argued that Malcom&#x27;s actions were lawful—so precisely lawful, in fact, that Reid speculated that Malcom may have been acting under the advice of his lawyer, James Otis. According to Reid, Malcom and Otis may have been attempting to provoke a lawsuit so that they could once again &quot;challenge the validity of writs of assistance&quot; in court. This was one of several incidents when a Boston merchant resisted a search with a seemingly exact knowledge of the law; John Hancock, a prominent merchant and well-known smuggler, would act in a similar manner when customs officials attempted to search his ship &quot;Lydia&quot; in 1768.

===End of colonial writs===
Uncertainty about the legality of writs of assistance issued by colonial superior courts prompted Parliament to affirm that such writs were legal in the 1767 Townshend Acts. However, most colonial courts refused to issue general writs, and the Malcom case was apparently the last time a writ of assistance was issued in Boston.

===Legacy===
In response to the much-hated general writs, several of the colonies included a particularity requirement for search warrants in their constitutions when they established independent governments in 1776; the phrase &quot;particularity requirement&quot; is the legal term of art used in period cases to refer to an express requirement that the target of a search warrant must be &quot;particularly&quot; described in detail. Several years later, the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution also contained a particularity requirement that outlawed the use of writs of assistance (and all general search warrants) by the federal government. Later, the Fourth Amendment was incorporated against the states via the Fourteenth Amendment, and writs of assistance were proscribed.

==In the United Kingdom==
Writs of assistance continue to have force in the United Kingdom and may be used by customs officers to enter any building by force and search and seize anything liable to forfeiture.
The officer must have reasonable grounds to suspect that goods liable for forfeiture are kept on the premises and that the goods are likely to be removed, destroyed or lost before a search warrant can be obtained and executed. Writs of assistance are valid from the date of issue and cease to be valid six months after the end of the reign of the monarch under which the order was issued.

== In Canada ==
Until 1985, four federal statutes in Canada—the &quot;Customs Act&quot;, &quot;Excise Tax Act&quot;, &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot;, and &quot;Narcotic Control Act&quot;—provided that writs of assistance were to be granted to officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other federal officers, on a mandatory basis, for enforcement purposes. The notion of a writ of assistance in Canadian statute dates back at least to 1847, when a statute of the Province of Canada was passed providing for writs of assistance in customs enforcement; a statute of Nova Scotia referred to such a writ in 1834, while a New Brunswick statute dated to 1846.

Statutory writs of assistance were described by the Exchequer Court of Canada (now the Federal Court) as &quot;in effect, search warrants unrelated to any particular suspected offence and of continuing operation, which are issued to members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other officers in the service of the Government of Canada to have effect as long as the holder continues to hold the position by virtue of which the writ was issued to him.&quot; Perhaps more concisely, one commentator described the legal effect of a writ of assistance as, &quot;to all intents and purposes, a blanket warrant&quot; which &quot;authorizes the holder to search for particular things (e.g., controlled drugs or smuggled goods) anywhere and at any time.&quot;

However, since judicial authorization was not required for any given search conducted pursuant to a writ of assistance, this characterization is somewhat misleading. Rather, as noted by the Law Reform Commission of Canada in a 1983 report, &quot;[i]n essence, they are documents that identify their holders as members of a specific class of peace officers with special powers of warrantless search and seizure.&quot; Moreover, although search warrants are subject to various common law requirements of particularity, the same was not evidently true for statutory writs of assistance.

In 1984, the Ontario Court of Appeal declared statutory writs of assistance to be contrary to section 8 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. Statutory writs of assistance were repealed in Canada in 1985.

<text>In mathematics, a generalized flag variety (or simply flag variety) is a homogeneous space whose points are flags in a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field F. When F is the real or complex numbers, a generalized flag variety is a smooth or complex manifold, called a real or complex flag manifold. Flag varieties are naturally projective varieties.

Flag varieties can be defined in various degrees of generality. A prototype is the variety of complete flags in a vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field F, which is a flag variety for the special linear group over F. Other flag varieties arise by considering partial flags, or by restriction from the special linear group to subgroups such as the symplectic group. For partial flags, one needs to specify the sequence of dimensions of the flags under consideration. For subgroups of the linear group, additional conditions must be imposed on the flags.

In the most general sense, a generalized flag variety is defined to mean a projective homogeneous variety, that is, a smooth projective variety &quot;X&quot; over a field F with a transitive action of a reductive group &quot;G&quot; (and smooth stabilizer subgroup; that is no restriction for F of characteristic zero). If &quot;X&quot; has an F-rational point, then it is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot;/&quot;P&quot; for some parabolic subgroup &quot;P&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. A projective homogeneous variety may also be realised as the orbit of a highest weight vector in a projectivized representation of &quot;G&quot;. The complex projective homogeneous varieties are the compact flat model spaces for Cartan geometries of parabolic type. They are homogeneous Riemannian manifolds under any maximal compact subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, and they are precisely the coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups.

Flag manifolds can be symmetric spaces. Over the complex numbers, the corresponding flag manifolds are the Hermitian symmetric spaces. Over the real numbers, an &quot;R&quot;-space is a synonym for a real flag manifold and the corresponding symmetric spaces are called symmetric &quot;R&quot;-spaces.

==Flags in a vector space==

A flag in a finite dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field F is an increasing sequence of subspaces, where &quot;increasing&quot; means each is a proper subspace of the next (see filtration):
:formula_1
If we write the dim &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; then we have
:formula_2
where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of &quot;V&quot;. Hence, we must have &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;. A flag is called a &quot;complete flag&quot; if &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;i&quot; for all &quot;i&quot;, otherwise it is called a &quot;partial flag&quot;. The &quot;signature&quot; of the flag is the sequence (&quot;d&quot;1, ..., &quot;d&quot;&quot;k&quot;).

A partial flag can be obtained from a complete flag by deleting some of the subspaces. Conversely, any partial flag can be completed (in many different ways) by inserting suitable subspaces.

==Prototype: the complete flag variety==

According to basic results of linear algebra, any two complete flags in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field F are no different from each other from a geometric point of view. That is to say, the general linear group acts transitively on the set of all complete flags.

Fix an ordered basis for &quot;V&quot;, identifying it with F&quot;n&quot;, whose general linear group is the group GL(&quot;n&quot;,F) of &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; invertible matrices. The standard flag associated with this basis is the one where the &quot;i&quot;th subspace is spanned by the first &quot;i&quot; vectors of the basis. Relative to this basis, the stabilizer of the standard flag is the group of nonsingular lower triangular matrices, which we denote by &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;. The complete flag variety can therefore be written as a homogeneous space GL(&quot;n&quot;,F) / &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;, which shows in particular that it has dimension &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot;−1)/2 over F.

Note that the multiples of the identity act trivially on all flags, and so one can restrict attention to the special linear group SL(&quot;n&quot;,F) of matrices with determinant one, which is a semisimple algebraic group; the set of lower triangular matrices of determinant one is a Borel subgroup.

If the field F is the real or complex numbers we can introduce an inner product on &quot;V&quot; such that the chosen basis is orthonormal. Any complete flag then splits into a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces by taking orthogonal complements. It follows that the complete flag manifold over the complex numbers is the homogeneous space
:formula_3
where U(&quot;n&quot;) is the unitary group and T&quot;n&quot; is the &quot;n&quot;-torus of diagonal unitary matrices. There is a similar description over the real numbers with U(&quot;n&quot;) replaced by the orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;), and T&quot;n&quot; by the diagonal orthogonal matrices (which have diagonal entries ±1).

==Partial flag varieties==

The partial flag variety
:formula_4
is the space of all flags of signature (&quot;d&quot;1, &quot;d&quot;2, ... &quot;d&quot;&quot;k&quot;) in a vector space &quot;V&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; = &quot;d&quot;&quot;k&quot; over F. The complete flag variety is the special case that &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;i&quot; for all &quot;i&quot;. When &quot;k&quot;=2, this is a Grassmannian of &quot;d&quot;1-dimensional subspaces of &quot;V&quot;.

This is a homogeneous space for the general linear group &quot;G&quot; of &quot;V&quot; over F. To be explicit, take &quot;V&quot; = F&quot;n&quot; so that &quot;G&quot; = GL(&quot;n&quot;,F). The stabilizer of a flag of nested subspaces &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; of dimension &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; can be taken to be the group of nonsingular block lower triangular matrices, where the dimensions of the blocks are &quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot; := &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; − &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot;−1 (with &quot;d&quot;0 = 0).

Restricting to matrices of determinant one, this is a parabolic subgroup &quot;P&quot; of SL(&quot;n&quot;,F), and thus the partial flag variety is isomorphic to the homogeneous space SL(&quot;n&quot;,F)/&quot;P&quot;.

If F is the real or complex numbers, then an inner product can be used to split any flag into a direct sum, and so the partial flag variety is also isomorphic to the homogeneous space
:formula_5
in the complex case, or
:formula_6
in the real case.

== Generalization to semisimple groups ==
The upper triangular matrices of determinant one are a Borel subgroup of SL(&quot;n&quot;,F), and hence the stabilizers of partial flags are parabolic subgroups. Furthermore, a partial flag is determined by the parabolic subgroup which stabilizes it.

Hence, more generally, if &quot;G&quot; is a semisimple algebraic or Lie group, then the (generalized) flag variety for &quot;G&quot; is &quot;G&quot;/&quot;P&quot; where &quot;P&quot; is a parabolic subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. The correspondence between parabolic subgroups and generalized flag varieties allows each to be understood in terms of the other.

The extension of the terminology &quot;flag variety&quot; is reasonable, because points of &quot;G&quot;/&quot;P&quot; can still be described using flags. When &quot;G&quot; is a classical group, such as a symplectic group or orthogonal group, this is particularly transparent. If (&quot;V&quot;, &quot;ω&quot;) is a symplectic vector space then a partial flag in &quot;V&quot; is &quot;isotropic&quot; if the symplectic form vanishes on proper subspaces of &quot;V&quot; in the flag. The stabilizer of an isotropic flag is a parabolic subgroup of the symplectic group Sp(&quot;V&quot;,&quot;ω&quot;). For orthogonal groups there is a similar picture, with a couple of complications. First, if F is not algebraically closed, then isotropic subspaces may not exist: for a general theory, one needs to use the split orthogonal groups. Second, for vector spaces of even dimension 2&quot;m&quot;, isotropic subspaces of dimension &quot;m&quot; come in two flavours (&quot;self-dual&quot; and &quot;anti-self-dual&quot;) and one needs to distinguish these to obtain a homogeneous space.

==Cohomology==

If &quot;G&quot; is a compact, connected Lie group, it contains a maximal torus &quot;T&quot; and the space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;T&quot; of left cosets with the quotient topology is a compact real manifold. If &quot;H&quot; is any other closed, connected subgroup of &quot;G&quot; containing &quot;T&quot;, then &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is another compact real manifold. (Both are actually complex homogeneous spaces in a canonical way through complexification.) 

The presence of a complex structure and cellular (co)homology make it easy to see that the cohomology ring of &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is concentrated in even degrees, but in fact, something much stronger can be said. Because &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G/H&quot; is a principal &quot;H&quot;-bundle, there exists a classifying map &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; → &quot;BH&quot; with target the classifying space &quot;BH&quot;. If we replace &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; with the homotopy quotient &quot;G&quot;&quot;H&quot; in the sequence &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G/H&quot; → &quot;BH&quot;, we obtain a principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle called the Borel fibration of the right multiplication action of &quot;H&quot; on &quot;G&quot;, and we can use the cohomological Serre spectral sequence of this bundle to understand the fiber-restriction homomorphism &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;) → &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;)
and the characteristic map &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;BH&quot;) → &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;), so called because its image, the &quot;characteristic subring&quot; of &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;), carries the characteristic classes of the original bundle &quot;H&quot; → &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;.

Let us now restrict our coefficient ring to be a field &quot;k&quot; of characteristic zero, so that,
by Hopf&#x27;s theorem, &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;) is an exterior algebra on generators of odd degree (the subspace of primitive elements). It follows that the edge homomorphisms 

:formula_7

of the spectral sequence must eventually take the space of primitive elements in the left column &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;) of the page &quot;E&quot;2 bijectively into the bottom row &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;BH&quot;): we know &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; have the same rank,
so if the collection of edge homomorphisms were &quot;not&quot; full rank on the primitive subspace, then the image of the bottom row &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;BH&quot;) in the final page &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;) of the sequence would be infinite-dimensional as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space, which is impossible, for instance by cellular cohomology again, because a compact homogeneous space admits a finite CW structure.

Thus the ring map &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;) → &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;) is trivial in this case, and the characteristic map is surjective, so that &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;) is a quotient of &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;BH&quot;). The kernel of the map is the ideal generated by the images of primitive elements under the edge homomorphisms, which is also the ideal generated by positive-degree elements in the image of the canonical map &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;BG&quot;) → &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;BH&quot;) induced by the inclusion of &quot;H&quot; in &quot;G&quot;. 

The map &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;BG&quot;) → &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;BT&quot;) is injective, and likewise for &quot;H&quot;, with image the subring &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;BT&quot;)&quot;W&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of elements invariant under the action of the Weyl group, so one finally obtains the concise description

:formula_8

where formula_9 denotes positive-degree elements and the parentheses the generation of an ideal. For example, for the complete complex flag manifold &quot;U&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)/&quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;, one has 

:formula_10

where the &quot;t&quot;&quot;j&quot; are of degree 2 and the σ&quot;j&quot; are the first &quot;n&quot; elementary symmetric polynomials in the variables &quot;t&quot;&quot;j&quot;. For a more concrete example, take &quot;n&quot; = 2, so that &quot;U&quot;(&quot;2&quot;)/[&quot;U&quot;(1) × &quot;U&quot;(1)] is the complex Grassmannian Gr(1,formula_112) ≈ formula_11&quot;P&quot;1 ≈ &quot;S&quot;2. Then we expect the cohomology ring to be an exterior algebra on a generator of degree two (the fundamental class), and indeed,

:formula_13

as hoped.

==Highest weight orbits and projective homogeneous varieties==

If &quot;G&quot; is a semisimple algebraic group (or Lie group) and &quot;V&quot; is a (finite dimensional) highest weight representation of &quot;G&quot;, then the highest weight space is a point in the projective space P(&quot;V&quot;) and its orbit under the action of &quot;G&quot; is a projective algebraic variety. This variety is a (generalized) flag variety, and furthermore, every (generalized) flag variety for &quot;G&quot; arises in this way.

Armand Borel showed that this characterizes the flag varieties of a general semisimple algebraic group &quot;G&quot;: they are precisely the complete homogeneous spaces of &quot;G&quot;, or equivalently (in this context), the projective homogeneous &quot;G&quot;-varieties.

==Symmetric spaces==

Let &quot;G&quot; be a semisimple Lie group with maximal compact subgroup &quot;K&quot;. Then &quot;K&quot; acts transitively on any conjugacy class of parabolic subgroups, and hence the generalized flag variety &quot;G&quot;/&quot;P&quot; is a compact homogeneous Riemannian manifold &quot;K&quot;/(&quot;K&quot;∩&quot;P&quot;) with isometry group &quot;K&quot;. Furthermore, if &quot;G&quot; is a complex Lie group, &quot;G&quot;/&quot;P&quot; is a homogeneous Kähler manifold.

Turning this around, the Riemannian homogeneous spaces

:&quot;M&quot; = &quot;K&quot;/(&quot;K&quot;∩&quot;P&quot;)

admit a strictly larger Lie group of transformations, namely &quot;G&quot;. Specializing to the case that &quot;M&quot; is a symmetric space, this observation yields all symmetric spaces admitting such a larger symmetry group, and these spaces have been classified by Kobayashi and Nagano.

If &quot;G&quot; is a complex Lie group, the symmetric spaces &quot;M&quot; arising in this way are the compact Hermitian symmetric spaces: &quot;K&quot; is the isometry group, and &quot;G&quot; is the biholomorphism group of &quot;M&quot;.

Over the real numbers, a real flag manifold is also called an R-space, and the R-spaces which are Riemannian symmetric spaces under &quot;K&quot; are known as symmetric R-spaces. The symmetric R-spaces which are not Hermitian symmetric are obtained by taking &quot;G&quot; to be a real form of the biholomorphism group &quot;G&quot;c of a Hermitian symmetric space &quot;G&quot;c/&quot;P&quot;c such that &quot;P&quot; := &quot;P&quot;c∩&quot;G&quot; is a parabolic subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. Examples include projective spaces (with &quot;G&quot; the group of projective transformations) and spheres (with &quot;G&quot; the group of conformal transformations).

<text>Charles Dawson Butler (November 16, 1916May 18, 1988), professionally known as Daws Butler, was an American voice actor. He worked mostly for the Hanna-Barbera animation production company and the Walter Lantz cartoon studio. He originated the voices of many familiar Hanna-Barbera characters, including: Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, Quick Draw McGraw and Baba Looey, Augie Doggie, Loopy De Loop, Wally Gator, Snooper and Blabber, Dixie and Mr. Jinks, Hokey Wolf, Lippy the Lion, Elroy Jetson, Lambsy, Peter Potamus, The Funky Phantom and Hair Bear. While at Walter Lantz, he did the voices of: Chilly Willy, Smedley, Maxie the Polar Bear, Gooney and Sam in the &quot;Maggie and Sam series&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Butler was born on November 16, 1916, in Toledo, Ohio, the only child of Charles Allen Butler (1890–1972) and Ruth Butler (1899–1960). The family later moved from Ohio to Oak Park, Illinois, where Butler became interested in impersonating people.

In 1935, Butler began performing as an impressionist, entering multiple amateur contests and winning most of them—not with the intention of showing his talent, but as a personal challenge to overcome his shyness. He subsequently won professional engagements at vaudeville theaters.

He then teamed up with fellow performers Jack Lavin and Willard Ovitz, forming the comedy trio The Three Short Waves. They played in theaters, on radio, and in nightclubs, with positive reviews from regional critics and audiences. They dissolved the act in 1941 when Butler joined the U.S. Navy as America entered World War II. He subsequently met his wife-to-be Myrtis at a wartime function near Washington, D.C.

His first voice work for an animated character was in the animated short &quot;Short Snorts on Sports&quot; (1948), produced by Screen Gems. At the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio, Tex Avery hired Butler to provide the voice of a British wolf on &quot;Little Rural Riding Hood&quot; (1949) and also to narrate several of his cartoons.

Throughout the late 1940s and mid-1950s, Butler had roles in many Avery-directed cartoons: the Fox in &quot;Out-Foxed&quot;, the narrator/cat in &quot;The Cuckoo Clock&quot;, the Cobbler in &quot;The Peachy Cobbler&quot;, Mr. Theeves and Spike (one line) in &quot;Droopy&#x27;s Double Trouble&quot;, Mysto the Magician in &quot;Magical Maestro&quot;, John the Cab and John the B-29 Bomber in &quot;One Cab&#x27;s Family&quot; and &quot;Little Johnny Jet&quot;, and Charlie in &quot;The Legend of Rockabye Point&quot;.

Beginning with &quot;The Three Little Pups&quot;, Butler provided the voice for a nameless wolf that spoke in a Southern accent and whistled all the time (the tune was Henry C. Work&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot;). The character also appeared in &quot;Sheep Wrecked&quot;, &quot;Billy Boy,&quot; and many other cartoons. At MGM, Avery wanted Butler to take on the voice of Droopy, at a time when Bill Thompson was unavailable due to radio engagements. Butler did a few lines, then recommended Don Messick, another actor and Butler&#x27;s lifelong friend, who was better at imitating Thompson. Messick voiced Droopy in several shorts.

In 1949, Butler landed a role in a televised puppet show created by former Warner Bros. Cartoons animation director Bob Clampett called &quot;Time for Beany&quot;. He was teamed with Stan Freberg, with whom he did all the puppets&#x27; voices: Butler voiced Beany Boy and Captain Huffenpuff, and Freberg voiced Cecil and Dishonest John. An entire stable of recurring characters were also seen. The show&#x27;s writers were Charles Shows and Lloyd Turner, whose dependably funny dialog was still always at the mercy of Butler&#x27;s and Freberg&#x27;s ad libs. &quot;Time for Beany&quot; ran from 1949 to 1954, and won several Emmy Awards.

In 1952, Butler starred in the live-action short &quot;Nice Try, Virgil&quot;.

He briefly turned his attention to writing and voicing TV commercials. In the 1950s, Freberg asked him to help him write comedy skits for his Capitol Records albums. Their first collaboration, &quot;St. George and the Dragonet&quot; (based on &quot;Dragnet&quot;), was the first comedy record to sell over a million copies. Freberg was more of a satirist who did song parodies, but the bulk of his dialogue routines were co-written by and co-starred Butler.

Butler teamed again with Freberg and actress June Foray in a CBS radio series, &quot;The Stan Freberg Show&quot;, which ran from July to October 1957 as a summer replacement for Jack Benny&#x27;s program. Freberg&#x27;s box set, &quot;Tip of the Freberg&quot; (Rhino Entertainment, 1999), chronicles every aspect of Freberg&#x27;s career except the cartoon voice-over work, and showcases his career with Butler. In &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot;, the UPA theatrical animated short series for Columbia Pictures, Butler played Magoo&#x27;s nephew Waldo (also voiced by Jerry Hausner at various times). In Freberg&#x27;s &quot;Green Chri$tma$&quot; in 1958, a scathing indictment of the over-commercialization of the holiday, Butler soberly hoped instead that we&#x27;d remember &quot;whose birthday we&#x27;re celebrating&quot;.

Butler provided the voices of many nameless Walter Lantz Productions&#x27; characters for theatrical shorts later seen on the &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; program. His characters included the penguin Chilly Willy and his best friend Smedley, a Southern-accented dog (the same voice used for Tex Avery&#x27;s laid-back wolf character and for Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Huckleberry Hound).

In 1957, when MGM had closed their animation unit, producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera quickly formed their own company, and Butler and Don Messick were on hand to provide voices. The first, &quot;The Ruff and Reddy Show&quot;, with Butler voicing Reddy, set the formula for the rest of the series of cartoons that the two helmed until the mid-1960s. He played the title roles in &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;, &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot;, and &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;, and portrayed a variety of other characters.

Butler voiced most of these characters for decades, in both TV shows and in some commercials. The breakfast cereal mascot Cap&#x27;n Crunch became an icon of sorts on Saturday morning TV through many commercials produced by Jay Ward. Butler played Cap&#x27;n from the 1960s to the 1980s. He based the voice on that of character actor Charles Butterworth. In 1961, while Mel Blanc was recovering from a road accident, Daws Butler substituted for him to voice Barney Rubble in five episodes of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (&quot;The Hit Songwriter&quot;, &quot;Droop-Along Flintstone&quot;, &quot;Fred Flintstone Woos Again&quot;, &quot;The Rock Quarry Story&quot;, &quot;The Little White Lie&quot;). Butler had previously voiced the characters of Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble in the 90 second pilot for the series (when it was called &quot;The Flagstones&quot;).

In 1964, Butler was featured as Huckleberry Hound on a 45rpm record, &quot;Bingo, Ringo&quot;, a comedic story combining The Beatles&#x27; drummer Ringo Starr and Lorne Greene&#x27;s hit record &quot;Ringo&quot;.

In &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, Butler provided the voices for a number of the racers, Rock Slag, Big Gruesome, the Red Max, Sgt. Blast, Peter Perfect, and Rufus Ruffcut. He voiced a penguin and a turtle in the movie &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, his only known work for Disney. Along with Stan Freberg, Paul Frees and June Foray, Butler also provided voices for children&#x27;s records featuring recreations of several successful Disney cartoons and films.

==Inspirations==

Butler based some of his voices on popular celebrities of the day. Yogi Bear began as an Art Carney impression; Butler had done a similar voice in several of Robert McKimson&#x27;s films at Warner Brothers, and on Stan Freberg&#x27;s comedy record &quot;The Honey-Earthers&quot;. However, he soon changed Yogi&#x27;s voice, making it much deeper and more sing-songy.

Hokey Wolf began as an impression of Phil Silvers, and Snagglepuss as Bert Lahr. When Snagglepuss began appearing in commercials for Kellogg&#x27;s Cocoa Krispies in 1961, Lahr threatened to sue Butler for &quot;stealing&quot; his voice. As part of the settlement, the disclaimer &quot;Snagglepuss voice by Daws Butler&quot; was required to appear on each commercial, making him the only voice actor ever to receive credit in an animated TV commercial. Huckleberry Hound was inspired by a North Carolina neighbor of Butler&#x27;s wife&#x27;s family; he previously used the voice for Tex Avery&#x27;s laid-back wolf and Walter Lantz&#x27;s Smedley.

==Later life==
In the 1970s, Butler was the voice of &quot;Hair Bear&quot; on &quot;Help!... It&#x27;s the Hair Bear Bunch!&quot; and a few characters in minor cartoons such as &quot;C.B. Bears&quot;. On &quot;Laff-a-Lympics&quot;, he was virtually the entire &quot;Yogi Yahooey&quot; team. He also played the title character in &quot;The Funky Phantom&quot;, and Louie and Pug on &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;. In 1977, he guest-starred as Captain Numo and his lackey Schultz on the &quot;What&#x27;s New, Mr. Magoo?&quot; episode &quot;Secret Agent Magoo&quot;.

Apart from specials and commercials, Butler was less prolific in the 1970s and 1980s until a revival of &quot;The Jetsons&quot; and Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s crossover series &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot;, both in 1985. In 1983, he voiced the title character Wacky WallWalker in &quot;Deck the Halls with Wacky Walls&quot;.

In 1975, Butler began an acting workshop which spawned such talents as Nancy Cartwright, Corey Burton, Joe Bevilacqua, Bill Farmer, Pat Parris, Tony Pope, Linda Gary, Bob Bergen, Greg Berg, Greg Burson, Mona Marshall, Brian Cummings, Sherry Lynn, Joey Camen, Keith Scott, Sonny Melendrez, Charles Howerton, Hal Rayle, and writer Earl Kress.

In the year of his death, &quot;The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound&quot; was released, featuring most of his early characters.

==Personal life==
Daws met and married Myrtis Martin in 1943 while he was in the United States Navy during World War II. They had four sons, David, Don, Paul and Charles, and remained married until his death in 1988.

==Death==
Butler died of a heart attack on May 18, 1988, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at age 71. A few months before he died, he contracted pneumonia, and had suffered a stroke a few months before that. The television special &quot;Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s 50th: A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration&quot; was dedicated to him. Many of his roles were assumed by Greg Burson, whom Butler personally trained until his death.

Myrtis Mayfield Martin Butler (born January 13, 1917, Stanly County, North Carolina) died on November 15, 2018, in Beverly Hills, California at the age of 101. She was buried next to Daws in Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City.

==Legacy==
Butler trained many voice actors, including: Nancy Cartwright (the voice of Bart Simpson), Corey Burton (the voice of Count Dooku in several animated &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, as well as Dale in &quot;Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale&quot;), Bill Farmer (the current voice of Goofy, Pluto, and Horace Horsecollar), Bob Bergen (the voice of Porky Pig), Joe Bevilacqua (whom Butler personally taught how to do all his characters), Sherry Lynn, Greg Burson (the voice of Yogi Bear and Bugs Bunny) and Mona Marshall (the voice of various characters in &quot;South Park&quot;). Butler&#x27;s voice and scripts were a frequent part of Bevilacqua&#x27;s now-defunct XM show.

Bevilacqua also wrote Butler&#x27;s official biography, published by Bear Manor Media. A new book of cartoon scripts written by Butler and Joe Bevilacqua, &quot;Uncle Dunkle and Donnie: Fractured Fables&quot;, was scheduled for publication in the fall of 2009. A four-volume, 4½-hour audio set of &quot;Uncle Dunkle and Donnie&quot; was to be simultaneously released, with Bevilacqua performing all 97 characters in 35 stories. Butler also trained Hal Rayle, who ultimately determined that his best-known character of Doyle Cleverlobe from &quot;Galaxy High School&quot; should sound like &quot;Elroy Jetson after he finished puberty&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* The video &quot;Daws Butler: Voice Magician&quot; is a 1987 documentary of Butler&#x27;s career, from his pre-MGM days through his teaming with Freberg in 1949 and teaming with Don Messick in 1957. It was originally seen as a PBS pledge-drive special.
* Former Butler protégé Joe Bevilacqua hosted a radio series on XM Satellite Radio&#x27;s Sonic Theater Channel called &quot;The Comedy-O-Rama Hour&quot;. It had a regular segment, &quot;What the Butler Wrote: Scenes from the Daws Butler Workshop,&quot; with rare scripts of Butler&#x27;s performed by his students (including Nancy Cartwright) and rare recordings of Butler himself. Bevilacqua has also co-authored (with Ben Ohmart) the authorized biography book &quot;Daws Butler, Characters Actor&quot;, and edited the book &quot;Scenes for Actors and Voices&quot; written by Butler, both published by Bear Manor Media.
* Butler was a contestant on Groucho Marx&#x27;s quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; in 1960. The studio audience did not recognize him until he began speaking like Huckleberry Hound. He and his partner Marie Gómez split the top prize of $10,000.
* In 1985, Butler was interviewed about his career on Dr. Demento&#x27;s radio show.

<text>Drexel Jerome Lewis Bixby (January 11, 1923 – April 28, 1998) was an American short story writer and scriptwriter. He wrote the 1953 story &quot;It&#x27;s a [[Jerome Bixby|Good]] Life&quot;, which was included in &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame&quot;. 

&quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot; formed the basis of a 1961 episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and was remade in &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983). He wrote four episodes for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series:&quot;Mirror, Mirror, Day of the Dove, Requiem for Methuselah&quot;, and &quot;By Any Other Name&quot;. With Otto Klement, he co-wrote the story upon which the science fiction movie &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966), the related television series, and the related Isaac Asimov novel were based. Bixby&#x27;s final produced or published work so far was the screenplay for the 2007 science fiction film &quot;The Man from Earth&quot;.

He also wrote many westerns and used the pseudonyms Jay Lewis Bixby, D. B. Lewis, Harry Neal, Albert Russell, J. Russell, M. St. Vivant, Thornecliff Herrick, and Alger Rome (for one collaboration with Algis Budrys).

==Life==
Bixby was born January 11, 1923, in Los Angeles, California, to Rex and Ila ( Lewis) Bixby. 

He studied piano and composition at the Juilliard School of Music.

He was the editor of &quot;Planet Stories&quot; from Summer 1950 to July 1951, &quot;Jungle Stories&quot; from Fall 1949 to Spring 1951 (a magazine which featured stories of Tarzan-imitation Ki-Gor and, briefly, Sheena, Queen of the Jungle), &quot;Action Stories&quot; from Fall 1949 to Fall 1950, and founding editor of &quot;Two Complete Science-Adventure Books&quot; (from Winter 1950 to July 1951) and of &quot;Two Western Romances&quot; from Summer 1950 to Summer 1951 (by which time it was retitled &quot;2 Western-Action Books&quot;). All these titles were published by Fiction House, which also published corresponding comic books for which Bixby also wrote and edited.

His best-known television works include four original &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes, including 1967&#x27;s &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, which introduced the franchise&#x27;s concept of the &quot;Mirror Universe&quot;; and 1969&#x27;s &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot;, about &quot;Flint&quot;, a 6,000-year-old man. He also scripted &quot;Day of the Dove&quot; and &quot;By Any Other Name&quot;.

His short story &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot; (1953), adapted as a teleplay for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; by Rod Serling, is arguably his best-known work, in his original prose and in audio/visual adaptations. It was revisited in the 1983 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; film, and chosen to be one of the many &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes parodied by &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, this one in the Halloween 1991 episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror II&quot;.

Bixby conceived and co-wrote the story for the 1966 film &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;,
Bantam Books obtained the rights for a paperback novelization based on the screenplay and approached Isaac Asimov to write it.

Jerome Bixby&#x27;s last work, a screenplay, &quot;The Man from Earth&quot;, was conceived in the early 1960s and completed on his deathbed in April 1998. In 2007, it was made into an independent motion picture, with his son Emerson Bixby as executive producer, directed by Richard Schenkman, and starring David Lee Smith, William Katt, Richard Riehle, Tony Todd, Annika Peterson, Alexis Thorpe, Ellen Crawford, and John Billingsley.

Bixby wrote the original screenplay for &quot;It! The Terror from Beyond Space&quot; (1958), which inspired &quot;Alien&quot; (1979). The &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; seventh-season Mirror Universe episode, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Cloak&quot; (1999), is dedicated to Bixby&#x27;s memory.

Isaac Asimov described Bixby as &quot;an excellent piano player&quot;.

He died on April 28, 1998, in San Bernardino, California, of heart failure, aged 75.

<text>The 68 Ventures Bowl is a postseason NCAA-sanctioned Division I FBS college football bowl game that has been played annually in Mobile, Alabama since 1999. In 2021, the game was moved from Ladd–Peebles Stadium to Hancock Whitney Stadium, on the campus of the University of South Alabama. The game currently matches teams from the Sun Belt Conference and the Mid-American Conference. Originally known as the Mobile Alabama Bowl during its first two playings, it has undergone many name changes.

==History==
The game was known as the Mobile Alabama Bowl for its first two playings, in 1999 and 2000. GMAC (now Ally Financial) had become the title sponsor for the 2000 playing, and the game was renamed as the GMAC Bowl for the 2001 though January 2010 playings. It was then the GoDaddy.com Bowl for the January 2011 to January 2013 playings when GoDaddy took over sponsorship. In May 2013, it was announced that the &quot;.com&quot; would be dropped from the bowl&#x27;s name, rebranding it as the GoDaddy Bowl for the January 2014 through December 2015 editions. Dollar General took over sponsorship on August 17, 2016, with the 2016 through 2018 playings branded as the Dollar General Bowl. It was announced on May 29, 2019, that Dollar General would no longer sponsor the bowl. It was temporarily called by its original name, the Mobile Alabama Bowl, until new sponsorship by LendingTree was announced on November 15, 2019, making it the LendingTree Bowl. On May 15, 2023, the game was renamed as the 68 Ventures Bowl for its new sponsor, Daphne based 68 Ventures, a real estate investment company.

When the bowl first began, it was played as one of the first games of the bowl season in December. The 2006 season saw the game moved to January, and it served as one of the last bowls played before the national championship game of either the Bowl Championship Series or the College Football Playoff. For the 2015 season, the bowl was moved back to December, where it remained for every subsequent playing except for the 2019 season.

===Conference tie-ins===
From 1999 to 2009, the bowl pitted a Conference USA (C-USA) team against a team from the Mid-American Conference (MAC), except for the first two playings, when the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) could receive the bid if one of its easternmost teams qualified as bowl eligible.

For the January 2010 edition, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) was to participate in the bowl as its ninth bowl tie-in. The ACC failed to have sufficient bowl-eligible teams to fill the slot, and the bowl chose Sun Belt Conference champion Troy as a replacement. A MAC vs. Sun Belt matchup was then featured for a total of 11 consecutive bowls, through the January 2020 edition. That streak was broken when the December 2020 edition invited teams from C-USA and the Sun Belt. After Arkansas State of the Sun Belt appeared in the 2012 through 2015 editions of the bowl, the conference and bowl committee agreed on changing the team selection bylaws to avoid repeat appearances by teams in consecutive years.

===Notable games===
*The 2001 game between the Marshall Thundering Herd and East Carolina Pirates set the record as the highest-scoring bowl game of all time, and Marshall achieved what was then the greatest scoring comeback in bowl history. In this contest, Marshall battled back from a 38–8 deficit to win 64–61, in double overtime. Thundering Herd quarterback Byron Leftwich threw for 576 yards in the game.
*The 2008 game had the largest margin of victory in bowl history, with Tulsa defeating Bowling Green, 63–7.
*Following the 2023 game, a 59–10 win by South Alabama over Eastern Michigan, an altercation took place on-field between the teams prior to the trophy presentation, initiated by an Eastern Michigan player sucker punching a South Alabama player while the South Alabama marching band and team were singing the school&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;.

<doc id="385354" wikidata="Q1302812" url="?curid=385354" title="Hooded oriole">
<text>The hooded oriole (Icterus cucullatus) is a medium-sized New World oriole. The male of this species ranges in color from a bright orange to a paler yellow, with a black back, face, tail and bib, with the wing containing two white bars. The female is more of an olive color with some yellow accents.

==Description and ecology==
Adults have a curved bill which is completely black and white wing bars. The adult male has a deep yellowish orange head with black on the face and throat; they are black on the back, wings and tail, orange on the underparts. The adult female is olive-green on the upper parts, yellowish on the breast and belly. Their calls consist of whistling and wheets, while their song is a mixture of both.

Their breeding habitat is open areas with trees, especially palms, across the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The nest is a tightly woven pouch attached to the underside of a leaf or tree branch. Sometimes their nest is filled with the egg of a brown-headed cowbird which is a parasite bird that lays its eggs in other birds nests for that species to take care of.

These birds migrate in flocks south to Mexico&#x27;s southwestern coast; they are permanent residents in Baja California Sur, the Mexican east coast, and Belize. Some may over-winter near feeders. They can also be found in Southern California neighborhoods, but are rare in the winter.

They forage in trees and shrubs, also feeding from flowers. It is a nectar robber because it pierces the base of the flower, and does not assist in pollination. These birds mainly eat insects, nectar and fruit, and will also visit hummingbird feeders and bird feeders for seeds.

==Behavior==

Diet

The hooded oriole&#x27;s diet consists of insects, berries, and nectar. Hooded Orioles are acrobatic feeders, often hanging upside down to get the nectar from flowers and to catch their prey. This species feeds on a variety of insects, but may especially favor caterpillars, beetles, wasps, and ants. Hooded orioles forage for food slowly, gathering insects from foliage in the trees and feeding on berries, along with sometimes oranges or other citrus. They also probe flowers for nectar, and may take insects there as well. They are common visitors to insect and hummingbird feeders.

Voice

The song of the hooded oriole tends to be short and abrupt. The notes are rapid and lack the whistling nature of many other oriole species, and often sound nasal and whiny in nature. 

There is a high amount of variation both geographically and individually within the song of the hooded oriole. Each male also sings many different types of songs. The hooded oriole has been known to include mimicry in its song, notably in Arizona some individuals have included the songs of the Gila Woodpecker and the Ash-throated Flycatcher.

Common calls of the hooded oriole include a whistled wheet or sweet sound. A chatter call is given as an alarm, somewhat similar to that of the Baltimore oriole or Bullock&#x27;s oriole. The individual notes of the hooded oriole&#x27;s chatter are given more quickly however, and it creates a shriller sound. Juveniles commonly give a soft chut and a harsher chuck or chet, however these have also been observed being given by adults.

Nesting

Males arrive at their nesting sites in the last weeks of March and set up breeding territories. The breeding season lasts from April to July in Texas, May to August in Arizona, April to mid-August in California, and May to August in Baja California. 

Recent reports state that the nests are constructed and secured on the undersides of palms and banana plants. Location and structure materials vary geographically. Arizona nests are often made of grasses and located in taller trees. Meanwhile, California nests are made from palm fibers and located on the underside of palm plants. The hooded oriole&#x27;s nest is basket shaped, and much deeper than its relatives.

Female hooded orioles lay a clutch of 3–5 eggs. The eggs are generally white, but can range into a pale blue with darker splotches. The eggs are incubated for 12–14 days, and the nestlings take about 14 days to fledge. This species is also commonly parasitized by the brown-headed cowbird and the bronzed cowbird.

==Geographic variation==
There are five subspecies divided into two groups: those east of the Big Bend in Texas, which are more orange in color, and those found in New Mexico and more south, which are yellower in color.

I. c. cucullatus 

This subspecies is found in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas and south through Mexico to Oaxaca and Veracruz. This subspecies is very orange in color.

I. c. sennetti 

This subspecies occurs from the lower Rio Grande valley of Texas south along the coastal plain into Tamaulipas. This subspecies is similar in color to cucullatus but is notably paler and more yellow. 

I. c. igneus

This subspecies occurs in southern Mexico from East Tabasco and the Yucatán Peninsula south into Belize. This is the brightest most orange form. It has been reported that females of this subspecies may display a more greyish throat patch. 

I. c. nelsoni 

This is the western form of this species, found from California south to North Baja California, and east into Arizona and New Mexico. This subspecies is noticeably more yellow than the others. This subspecies also has a much more slender bill, and longer wings and shorter tail.

I. c. trochiloides 

This subspecies is found in Baja California and Mexico. This is a yellowish-orange combo, and has a much longer and thinner bill.

<text>The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (, ) is a landlocked exclave of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The region covers with a population of 459,600. It is bordered by Armenia to the east and north, Iran to the southwest, and Turkey to the west. It is the sole autonomous republic of Azerbaijan, governed by its own elected legislature.

The republic, especially the capital city of Nakhchivan, has a long history dating back to about 1500 BC. &quot;Nakhijevan&quot; was one the cantons of the historical Armenian province of Vaspurakan in the Kingdom of Armenia. Historically, the Persians, Armenians, Mongols, and Turks all competed for the region. The area that is now Nakhchivan became part of Safavid Iran in the 16th century. The semi-autonomous Nakhchivan Khanate was established there in the mid-18th century. In 1828, after the last Russo-Persian War and the Treaty of Turkmenchay, the Nakhchivan Khanate passed from Iranian into Imperial Russian possession.

After the 1917 February Revolution, Nakhchivan and its surrounding region were under the authority of the Special Transcaucasian Committee of the Russian Provisional Government and subsequently of the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. When the TDFR was dissolved in May 1918, Nakhchivan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Syunik, and Qazakh were heavily contested between the newly formed and short-lived states of the First Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR). In June 1918, the region came under Ottoman occupation. Under the terms of the Armistice of Mudros, the Ottomans agreed to pull their troops out of the Transcaucasus to make way for British occupation at the close of the First World War. The British placed Nakhchivan under Armenian administration in April 1919, although an Azerbaijani revolt prevented Armenia from establishing full control over the territory.

In July 1920, the Bolsheviks occupied the region. In November of that year, Bolshevik Russia and Azerbaijan both promised that Nakhchivan, alongside neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh and Zangezur, was an &quot;integral part&quot; of Armenia. However, on March 16, 1921, in accordance with the results of a referendum, the Bolshevik government declared the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which went on to become an autonomous republic &quot;within&quot; the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924. In January 1990, Nakhchivan declared independence from the USSR to protest against the suppression of the national movement in Azerbaijan and became the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within the newly independent Republic of Azerbaijan a year later.

Though a mixed Azerbaijani-Armenian region as late as a century ago, Nakhchivan is homogeneously Azerbaijani today besides a small population of Russians.

== Etymology ==
Variations of the name Nakhchivan include Nakhichevan, Naxcivan, Naxçivan, Nakhijevan, Nakhchawan, Nakhitchevan, Nakhjavan, and Nakhdjevan. Nakhchivan is mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; and by other classical writers as &quot;Naxuana&quot;.

The older form of the name is &quot;Naxčawan&quot; (). According to philologist Heinrich Hübschmann, the name was originally borne by the namesake city (modern Nakhchivan) and later given to the region. Hübschmann believed the name to be composed of &quot;Naxič&quot; or &quot;Naxuč&quot; (probably a personal name) and &quot;awan&quot;, an Armenian word (ultimately of Iranian origin) meaning &quot;place, town&quot;.

In the Armenian tradition, the name of the region and its namesake city is connected with the Biblical narrative of Noah&#x27;s Ark and interpreted as meaning &quot;place of the first descent&quot; or &quot;first resting place&quot; (as if deriving from and ) due to it being regarded as the site where Noah descended and settled after the landing of the Ark on nearby Mount Ararat. It was probably under the influence of this tradition that the name changed in Armenian from the older &quot;Naxčawan&quot; to &quot;Naxijewan&quot;. Although this is a folk etymology, William Whiston believed Nakhchivan/Nakhijevan to be the &quot;Apobatērion&quot; (&quot;place of descent&quot;) mentioned by the first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus in connection with Noah&#x27;s Ark, which would make the tradition connecting the name with the Biblical figure Noah very old, predating Armenia&#x27;s conversion to Christianity in the early fourth century.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

The oldest material culture artifacts found in the region date back to the Neolithic Age. On the other hand, Azerbaijani archaeologists have found that the history of Nakhchivan dates back to the Stone Age (Paleolithic). As a result of archaeological diggings, archaeologists discovered a great number of Stone-Age materials in different regions of Nakhchivan. These materials were useful to study the Paleolithic age in Azerbaijan. Pollen analysis conducted in Gazma Cave (Sharur District) suggests that humans in the Middle Palaeolithic (Mousterian) lived not only in the mountain forests but also in the dry woodlands found in Nakhchivan. Several archaeological sites dating from the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods have also been found in Nakhchivan, including the ancient towns of Nakhchivan Tepe (near the city of Nakhchivan) and Ovchular Tepesi. Some of the oldest salt mines in the world have also been discovered.

The region was part of the states of Urartu and later Media. It became part of the Satrapy of Armenia under Achaemenid Persia c. 521 BC. After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC several generals of the Macedonian army, including Neoptolemus, attempted but failed to take control of the region, and it was ruled by the native Armenian dynasty of Orontids until Armenia was conquered by Antiochus III the Great (ruled 222–187 BC).

In 189 BC, Nakhchivan became part of the new Kingdom of Armenia established by Artaxias I. Within the kingdom, the region of present-day Nakhchivan was part of the Ayrarat, Vaspurakan and Syunik provinces. According to the early medieval Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, from the third to second centuries, the region belonged to the Muratsyan &quot;nakharar&quot; family but after disputes with central power, King Artavazd I massacred the family and seized the lands and formally attached it to the kingdom. The area&#x27;s status as a major trade center allowed it to prosper; as a result, many foreign powers coveted it. According to the Armenian historian Faustus of Byzantium (5th century), when the Sassanid Persians invaded Armenia, Sassanid King Shapur II (310–380) removed 2,000 Armenian and 16,000 Jewish families in 360–370. In 428, the Armenian Arshakuni monarchy was abolished and Nakhchivan was annexed by Sassanid Persia. In 623, possession of the region passed to the Byzantine Empire but was soon left to its own rule. Sebeos referred to the area as Tachkastan. According to the 5th-century Armenian author Koriun, Nakhchivan was the place where the Armenian scholar Mesrop Mashtots finished the creation of the Armenian alphabet and opened the first Armenian schools. This occurred in the province of Goghtan, which corresponds to Nakhchivan&#x27;s modern Ordubad district.

From 640 on, the Arabs invaded Nakhchivan and undertook many campaigns in the area, crushing all resistance and attacking Armenian nobles who remained in contact with the Byzantines or who refused to pay tribute. In 705, after suppressing an Armenian revolt, Arab viceroy Muhammad ibn Marwan decided to eliminate the Armenian nobility. In Nakhchivan, several hundred Armenian nobles were locked up in churches and burnt, while others were crucified.

The violence caused many Armenian princes to flee to the neighboring Kingdom of Georgia or the Byzantine Empire. Meanwhile, Nakhchivan itself became part of the autonomous Principality of Armenia under Arab control. In the eighth century, Nakhchivan was one of the scenes of an uprising against the Arabs led by Persian revolutionary Babak Khorramdin of the Iranian Khorram-Dinān (&quot;those of the joyous religion&quot; in Persian). Nakhchivan was finally released from Arab rule in the tenth century by Bagratuni King Smbat I and handed over to the princes of Syunik. This region also was taken by Sajids in 895 and between 909 and 929, Sallarid between 942 and 971 and Shaddadid between 971 and 1045.

About 1055, the Seljuk Turks took over the region. In the 12th century, the city of Nakhchivan became the capital of the state of Atabegs of Azerbaijan, also known as Ildegizid state, which included most of Iranian Azerbaijan and a significant part of the South Caucasus. The magnificent 12th-century mausoleum of Momine Khatun, the wife of Ildegizid ruler, Great Atabeg Jahan Pehlevan, is the main attraction of modern Nakhchivan. At its heyday, the Ildegizid authority in Nakhchivan and some other areas of South Caucasus was contested by Georgia. The Armeno-Georgian princely house of Zacharids frequently raided the region when the Atabeg state was in decline in the early years of the 13th century. It was then plundered by invading Mongols in 1220 and Khwarezmians in 1225 and became part of Mongol Empire in 1236 when the Caucasus was invaded by Chormaqan. In the 13th century, during the reign of the Mongol horde ruler Güyük Khan, Christians were allowed to build churches in the strongly Muslim town of Nakhchivan; however, the conversion to Islam of Gazan khan brought about a reversal of this favor. The 14th century saw the rise of Armenian Catholicism in Nakhchivan, though by the 15th century the territory became part of the states of Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu.

=== Iranian rule ===

In the 16th century, control of Nakhchivan passed to the Safavid dynasty. Until the demise of the Safavids, it remained as an administrative jurisdiction of the Erivan Province (also known as Chokhur-e Sa&#x27;d). Because of its geographic position, it frequently suffered during the wars between the Safavids and the Ottoman Empire, from the 16th to 18th centuries. Turkish historian İbrahim Peçevi described the passing of the Ottoman army from the Ararat plain to Nakhchivan:

In 1604, Shah Abbas I of Iran, concerned that the skilled peoples of Nakhchivan, its natural resources, and the surrounding areas could get in danger due to its relatively close proximity to the Ottoman-Persian frontline, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. He forcefully deported the entire hundreds of thousands of local population—Muslims, Jews, and Armenians alike—to leave their homes and move to the provinces south of the Aras River.

Many of the Armenian deportees were settled in the neighborhood of Isfahan that was named New Julfa since most of the residents were from the original Julfa. The Turkic Kangerli tribe was later permitted to move back under Shah Abbas II (1642–1666) to repopulate the frontier region of his realm. In the 17th century, Nakhchivan was the scene of a peasant movement led by Köroğlu against foreign invaders and &quot;native exploiters&quot;. In 1747, the Nakhchivan Khanate emerged in the region after the death of Nader Shah Afshar.

=== Passing to Imperial Russian rule ===
After the last Russo-Persian War and the Treaty of Turkmenchay, the Nakhchivan Khanate passed into Russian possession in 1828 due to Iran&#x27;s forced ceding as a result of the outcome of the war and treaty. With the onset of Russian rule, the Tsarist authorities encouraged resettlement of Armenians to Nakhchivan and other areas of the Caucasus from the Persian and Ottoman Empires. Special clauses of the Turkmenchay and Adrianople treaties allowed for this. Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, stated that by the time Nakhchivan came under Russian rule, there had been 290 native Armenians families in the province excluding the city of Nakhchivan, the number of Muslim families was 1,632, and the number of the Armenian immigrant families was 943. The same numbers in the city of Nakhchivan were 114, 392, and 285 respectively. With such a dramatic influx of Armenian immigrants, Griboyedov noted friction arising between the Armenian and Muslim populations. He requested Russian army commander Count Ivan Paskevich to give orders on resettlement of some of the arriving people further to the region of Daralayaz to quiet the tensions.

The Nakhchivan Khanate was dissolved in 1828 the same year it came into Russian possession, and its territory was merged with the territory of the Erivan khanate and the area became the Nakhichevan uezd of the new Armenian oblast, which later became the Erivan Governorate in 1849. According to official statistics of the Russian Empire, by the turn of the 20th century Tatars (later known as Azerbaijanis) made up roughly 57% of the &quot;uezd&quot;&#x27;s population, while Armenians constituted roughly 42%. At the same time in the western half of the Sharur-Daralayaz uezd, the territory of which would form the northern part of modern-day Nakhchivan (Sharur District), Tatars constituted 70.5% of the population, while Armenians made up 27.5%. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, conflict erupted between the Armenians and the Tatars, culminating in the Armenian-Tatar massacres which saw violence in Nakhchivan in May of that year.

=== War and revolution ===

In the final year of World War I, Nakhchivan was the scene of more bloodshed between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who both laid claim to the area. By 1914, the Armenian population had decreased slightly to 40% while the Azeri population increased to roughly 60%. After the February Revolution, the region was under the authority of the Special Transcaucasian Committee of the Russian Provisional Government and subsequently of the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. When the TDFR was dissolved in May 1918, Nakhchivan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Zangezur (today the Armenian province of Syunik), and Qazakh were heavily contested between the newly formed and short-lived states of the Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR). In June 1918, the region came under Ottoman occupation. The Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages. Under the terms of the Armistice of Mudros, the Ottomans agreed to pull their troops out of the Transcaucasus to make way for the forthcoming British military presence.

Under British occupation, Sir Oliver Wardrop, British Chief Commissioner in the South Caucasus, made a border proposal to solve the conflict. According to Wardrop, Armenian claims against Azerbaijan should not go beyond the administrative borders of the former Erivan Governorate (which under prior Imperial Russian rule encompassed Nakhchivan), while Azerbaijan was to be limited to the governorates of Baku and Elizavetpol. This proposal was rejected by both Armenians (who did not wish to give up their claims to Qazakh, Zangezur and Karabakh) and Azeris (who found it unacceptable to give up their claims to Nakhchivan). As disputes between both countries continued, it soon became apparent that the fragile peace under British occupation would not last.

In December 1918, with the support of Azerbaijan&#x27;s Musavat Party, Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski declared the Republic of Aras in the Nakhchivan uyezd of the former Erivan Governorate assigned to Armenia by Wardrop. The Armenian government did not recognize the new state and sent its troops into the region to take control of it. The conflict soon erupted into the violent Aras War. British journalist C. E. Bechhofer Roberts described the situation in April 1920:

By mid-June 1919, however, Armenia succeeded in establishing control over Nakhchivan and the whole territory of the self-proclaimed republic. The fall of the Aras republic triggered an invasion by the regular Azerbaijani army and by the end of July, the Armenian administration was ousted from Nakhchivan. Again, more violence erupted leaving some ten thousand Armenians dead and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed. Meanwhile, feeling the situation to be hopeless and unable to maintain any control over the area, the British decided to withdraw from the region in mid-1919. Still, fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued and after a series of skirmishes that took place throughout the Nakhchivan district, a cease-fire agreement was concluded. However, the cease-fire lasted only briefly, and by early March 1920, more fighting broke out, primarily in Karabakh between Karabakh Armenians and Azerbaijan&#x27;s regular army. This triggered conflicts in other areas with mixed populations, including Nakhchivan.

Following the adoption of the name of &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; by the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, a naming dispute arose with Qajar Iran, with the latter protesting this decision. In tandem with this naming controversy, however, the young Azerbaijan Republic also faced a threat from the nascent Soviets in Moscow and the Armenians. In order to escape the possibility of a Soviet invasion and an even greater imminent threat of an Armenian invasion, Muslim Nakhchivan proposed being annexed to Iran. The then pro-British government in Tehran led by Vossug ed Dowleh made endeavours amongst Baku&#x27;s leadership to join Iran. In order to promote this idea, Vosugh ed Dowleh dispatched two separate Iranian delegations; one to Baku and one to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. The delegation at Baku, at the behest of Zia ol Din Tabatabaee, held intensive negotiations with the leadership of the Musavat party during the increasing chaos and instability in the city. During the closing stages, an accord was reached between them; however, before the idea was presented to Vossug ed Dowleh in Tehran, the Communists took over Baku and terminated the Musavat-Ottoman rule. The Iranian delegation at Paris, which was headed by foreign minister Firouz Nosrat-ed-Dowleh III, reached a unity negotiation with the delegation from Baku and signed a confederation agreement. In the end, these efforts proved to be of no avail, with the Soviets taking over the entirety of Transcaucasia.

=== Sovietization ===
In July 1920, the 11th Soviet Red Army invaded and occupied the region and on July 28, declared the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic with &quot;close ties&quot; to the Azerbaijan SSR. In November, on the verge of taking over Armenia, the Bolsheviks, to attract public support, promised they would allot Nakhchivan to Armenia, along with Karabakh and Zangezur. Nariman Narimanov, leader of Bolshevik Azerbaijan, issued a declaration celebrating the &quot;victory of Soviet power in Armenia&quot; and proclaimed that both Nakhchivan and Zangezur should be awarded to the Armenian people as a sign of the Azerbaijani people&#x27;s support for Armenia&#x27;s fight against the former Armenian government:

Vladimir Lenin, while welcoming this act of &quot;great Soviet fraternity&quot; where &quot;boundaries had no meaning among the family of Soviet peoples&quot;, did not agree with the motion and instead called for the people of Nakhchivan to be consulted in a referendum. According to the formal figures of this referendum, held at the beginning of 1921, 90% of Nakhchivan&#x27;s population wanted to be included in the Azerbaijan SSR &quot;with the rights of an autonomous republic&quot;. The decision to make Nakhchivan a part of modern-day Azerbaijan was cemented on March 16, 1921, in the Treaty of Moscow between Soviet Russia and the newly founded Republic of Turkey. The agreement between Soviet Russia and Turkey also called for attachment of the former Sharur-Daralagezsky Uyezd (which had a solid Azeri majority) to Nakhchivan, thus allowing Turkey to share a border with the Azerbaijan SSR. This deal was reaffirmed on October 13, in the Treaty of Kars. Article V of the treaty stated the following:
Thus, on February 9, 1924, the Soviet Union officially established the Nakhchivan ASSR. Its constitution was adopted on April 18, 1926.

=== In the Soviet Union ===

As a constituent part of the Soviet Union, tensions lessened over the ethnic composition of Nakhchivan or any territorial claims regarding it. Instead, it became an important point of industrial production with particular emphasis on the mining of minerals such as salt. Under Soviet rule, it was once a major junction on the Moscow-Tehran railway line as well as the Baku-Yerevan railway. It also served as an important strategic area during the Cold War, sharing borders with both Turkey (a NATO member state) and Iran (a close ally of the West until the Iranian Revolution of 1979).
Facilities improved during Soviet times. Education and public health especially began to see some major changes. In 1913, Nakhchivan only had two hospitals with a total of 20 beds. The region was plagued by widespread diseases including trachoma and typhus. Malaria, which mostly came from the adjoining Aras River, brought serious harm to the region. At any one time, between 70% and 85% of Nakhchivan&#x27;s population was infected with malaria, and in the region of Norashen (present-day Sharur) almost 100% were struck with the disease. This situation improved dramatically under Soviet rule. Malaria was sharply reduced and trachoma, typhus, and relapsing fever were eliminated.

During the Soviet era, Nakhchivan saw a great demographic shift. In 1926, 15% of the region&#x27;s population was Armenian, but by 1979, this number had shrunk to 1.4%. Azeris made up 85% in 1926, but 96% in 1979 (leaving the small remainder mixed or other). Three factors were involved: the emigration of Armenians to the Armenian SSR, the immigration of Azeris from Armenia, and the birth rate of Azeris being higher than that of Armenians.

Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh noted similar though slower demographic trends and feared an eventual &quot;de-Armenianization&quot; of the area. When tensions between Armenians and Azeris were reignited in the late-1980s by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Azerbaijan&#x27;s Popular Front managed to pressure the Azerbaijan SSR to instigate a partial railway and air blockade against Armenia, while another reason for the disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan, which resulted in railroad personnel refusing to enter Armenia. This effectively crippled Armenia&#x27;s economy, as 85% of the cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic. In response, Armenia closed the railway to Nakhchivan, thereby strangling the exclave&#x27;s only link to the rest of the Soviet Union.

December 1989 saw unrest in Nakhchivan as its Azeri inhabitants moved to physically dismantle the Soviet border with Iran to flee the area and meet their ethnic Azeri cousins in northern Iran. This action was angrily denounced by the Soviet leadership and the Soviet media accused the Azeris of &quot;embracing Islamic fundamentalism&quot;.

==== Declaring independence ====
On Saturday, January 20, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Nakhchivan ASSR issued a declaration stating the intention for Nakhchivan to secede from the USSR to protest the Soviet Union&#x27;s actions during Black January. Iranian Press Agency, IRNA, reported that upon its independence, Nakhchivan asked Turkey, Iran, and the United Nations to come to its aid. It was the first part of the Soviet Union to declare independence, preceding Lithuania&#x27;s declaration by only a few weeks. Subsequently, Nakhchivan was independent from Moscow and Baku but was then brought under control by the clan of Heydar Aliyev.

=== In the post-Soviet era ===
Heydar Aliyev, the future president of Azerbaijan, returned to his birthplace of Nakhchivan in 1990, after being ousted from his position in the Politburo by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. Soon after returning to Nakhchivan, Aliyev was elected to the Supreme Soviet by an overwhelming majority. Aliyev subsequently resigned from the CPSU, and after the failed August 1991 coup against Gorbachev, he called for complete independence for Azerbaijan and denounced Ayaz Mütallibov for supporting the coup. In late 1991, Aliyev consolidated his power base as chairman of the Nakhchivan Supreme Soviet and asserted Nakhchivan&#x27;s near-total independence from Baku.

Nakhchivan became a scene of conflict during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. On May 4, 1992, Armenian forces shelled the raion of Sadarak. The Armenians claimed that the attack was in response to cross-border shelling of Armenian villages by Azeri forces from Nakhchivan. David Zadoyan, a 42-year-old Armenian physicist and mayor of the region, said that the Armenians lost patience after months of firing by the Azeris. &quot;If they were sitting on our hilltops and harassing us with gunfire, what do you think our response should be?&quot; he asked. The government of Nakhchivan denied these charges and instead asserted that the Armenian assault was unprovoked and specifically targeted the site of a bridge between Turkey and Nakhchivan. &quot;The Armenians do not react to diplomatic pressure,&quot; Nakhchivan foreign minister Rza Ibadov told the ITAR-Tass news agency, &quot;It&#x27;s vital to speak to them in a language they understand.&quot; Speaking to the agency from the Turkish capital Ankara, Ibadov said that Armenia&#x27;s aim in the region was to seize control of Nakhchivan. According to Human Rights Watch, hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region.

The heaviest fighting took place on May 18, when the Armenians captured Nakhchivan&#x27;s exclave of Karki, a tiny territory through which Armenia&#x27;s main north–south highway passes. The exclave presently remains under Armenian control. After the fall of Shusha, the Mütallibov government of Azerbaijan accused Armenia of moving to take the whole of Nakhchivan (a claim that was denied by Armenian government officials). However, Heydar Aliyev declared a unilateral ceasefire on May 23 and sought to conclude a separate peace with Armenia. Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian expressed his willingness to sign a cooperation treaty with Nakhchivan to end the fighting, and subsequently a cease-fire was agreed upon.

The conflict in the area caused a harsh reaction from Turkey. Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Çiller announced that any Armenian advance on the main territory of Nakhchivan would result in a declaration of war against Armenia. Russian military leaders declared that &quot;third party intervention into the dispute could trigger a Third World War&quot;. Thousands of Turkish troops were sent to the border between Turkey and Armenia in early September. Russian military forces in Armenia countered their movements by increasing troop levels along the Armenian-Turkish frontier and bolstering defenses in a tense period where war between the two seemed inevitable. The tension reached its peak, when Turkish heavy artillery shelled the Nakhchivan side of the Nakhchivan-Armenian border, from the Turkish border for two hours. Iran also reacted to Armenia&#x27;s attacks by conducting military maneuvers along its border with Nakhchivan in a move widely interpreted as a warning to Armenia. However, Armenia did not launch any further attacks on Nakhchivan and the presence of Russia&#x27;s military warded off any possibility that Turkey might play a military role in the conflict. After a period of political instability, the Parliament of Azerbaijan turned to Heydar Aliyev and invited him to return from exile in Nakhchivan to lead the country in 1993.

=== Recent times ===
Today, Nakhchivan retains its autonomy as the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, and is internationally recognized as a constituent part of Azerbaijan governed by its own elected legislative assembly. A new constitution for Nakhchivan was approved in a referendum on November 12, 1995. The constitution was adopted by the republic&#x27;s assembly on April 28, 1998, and has been in force since January 8, 1999. However, the republic remains isolated, not only from the rest of Azerbaijan, but practically from the entire South Caucasus region. From 1995 until his resignation in December 2022, the region was ruled by Vasif Talibov, who is related by marriage to Azerbaijan&#x27;s ruling family, the Aliyevs. He was known for his authoritarian and largely corrupt rule of the region. Most residents prefer to watch Turkish television as opposed to Nakhchivan television, which one Azerbaijani journalist criticised as &quot;a propaganda vehicle for Talibov and the Aliyevs.&quot;

Economic hardships and energy shortages plague the area. There have been many cases of migrant workers seeking jobs in neighboring Turkey. &quot;Emigration rates to Turkey,&quot; one analyst said, &quot;are so high that most of the residents of the Besler district in Istanbul are Nakhchivanis.&quot; In 2007, an agreement was struck with Iran to obtain more gas exports, and a new bridge on the Aras River between the two countries was inaugurated in October 2007; the Azerbaijani president, Ilham Aliyev and the first vice-president of Iran, Parviz Davoodi also attended the opening ceremony.

As part of the 2020 ceasefire agreement which ended the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, Armenia, in the context of all economic and transport connections in the region to be unblocked, agreed &quot;to guarantee the security of transport connections between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to arrange unobstructed movement of persons, vehicles and cargo in both directions&quot;. As part of the agreement, these transport communications are to be patrolled by Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.

== Administrative divisions ==
Nakhchivan is subdivided into eight administrative divisions. Seven of these are &quot;raions&quot;. The capital city (şəhər) of Nakhchivan City is treated separately.

== Demographics ==
As of January 1, 2018, Nakhchivan&#x27;s population was estimated to be 452,831. Most of the population are Azerbaijanis, who constituted 99% of the population in 1999, while ethnic Russians (0.15%) and a minority of Kurds (0.6%) constituted the remainder of the population.

The Kurds of Nakhchivan are mainly found in the districts of Sadarak and Teyvaz. The remaining Armenians were expelled by Azerbaijani forces during the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh as part of the forceful exchange of population between Armenia and Azerbaijan. According to a 1932 Soviet estimate, 85% of the area&#x27;s population was rural, while only 15% was urban. This urban percentage increased to 18% by 1939 and 27% by 1959. As of 2011, 127,200 people of Nakhchivan&#x27;s total population of 435,400 live in urban areas, making the urban percentage 29.2%.

Nakhchivan enjoys a high Human Development Index; its socio-economic prowess far exceeds that of the neighbouring countries except for Turkey, as well as Azerbaijan itself. According to the report of Nakhchivan AR Committee of Statistics on June 30, 2014, for the end of 2013, some socio-economical data, including the following, are unveiled:

Making use of the Human Development Index calculation method according to the new UNHD 2014 method, the above values change into these:

Further, the value of the HDI becomes to
:formula_1

Were it a country, Nakhchivan would be ranked between Malaysia (62nd) and Mauritius (63rd) for its HDI. Iran&#x27;s HDI is 0.749 (75th), Turkey&#x27;s 0.759 (69th), and Azerbaijan&#x27;s 0.747 (76th).

== Geography ==
Nakhchivan is a semi-desert region that is separated from the main portion of Azerbaijan by Armenia. The Zangezur Mountains make up its border with Armenia while the Aras River defines its border with Iran. The Araz reservoir located on that river supplies water for agricultural needs and the hydroelectric dam generates power for both Azerbaijan and Iran. 

Nakhchivan is arid and mountainous. Its highest peak is Mount Kapudzhukh and its most distinctive is İlandağ (Snake Mountain) , which is visible from Nakhchivan City. According to legend, the cleft in its summit was formed by the keel of Noah&#x27;s Ark as the floodwaters abated. Qazangödağ is another major peak.

Both the absolute minimum temperature () and the absolute maximum temperature () were observed in Julfa and Ordubad.

== Economy ==

=== Industry ===
Nakhchivan&#x27;s major industries include the mining of minerals such as salt, molybdenum, and lead. Dryland farming, developed during the Soviet years, has allowed the region to expand into the growing of wheat (mostly cultivated on the plains of the Aras River), barley, cotton, tobacco, orchard fruits, mulberries, and grapes for producing wine. Other industries include cotton ginning/cleaning, silk spinning, fruit canning, meatpacking, and, in the drier regions, sheep farming. Processing of minerals, salt, radio engineering, farm ginning, preserving, silk products, meat, and dairy, bottling of mineral waters, clothing, and furniture are the principal branches of Nakhchivan&#x27;s industry. The Nakhchivan Automobile Plant (, abbr. NAZ), is a prominent automobile manufacturer in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The economy suffered a severe blow in 1988 with the loss of access to both raw materials and markets, due to the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. Although new markets are emerging in Iran and Turkey, this isolation still persists to this day, impairing development. The economy of Nakhchivan is based on agriculture, mining, and food processing, however, 75% of the republic&#x27;s budget is supplied by the central government in Baku. 

The Republic is rich in minerals. Nakhchivan possesses deposits of marble, lime, and gypsum. The deposits of the rock salt are exhausted in Nehram, Nakhchivan, and Sustin. The important molybdenum mines are currently closed as a consequence of the exclave&#x27;s isolation. There are a lot of mineral springs such as Badamli, Sirab, Nagajir, Kiziljir where water contains arsenic. About 90% of the agricultural land is now in private hands. However, agriculture has become a poorly capitalized, backyard activity. Production has dropped sharply and large-scale commercial agriculture has declined. Over two-thirds of the land are rocky slopes and deserts, therefore the area of arable lands is quite limited. The main crops – cotton and tobacco – are cultivated in the PriAraz plain, near Sharur and Nakhchivan City. Three-quarters of the grain production, especially winter wheat is concentrated on the irrigated lands of the Sharur plain and in the basin of the Nakhchivan river. Vine growing in Nakhchivan has an ancient tradition, in the Araz valley and foothills. Very hot summers and long warm autumns make it possible to grow such highly saccharine grapes as bayan-shiraz, tebrizi, shiraz. Wines such as &quot;Nakhchivan&quot; &quot;Shahbuz&quot;, &quot;Abrakunis&quot;, at &quot;Aznaburk&quot; are of reasonable quality and very popular. Fruit production is quite important, mainly of quince, pear, peach, apricot, fig, almonds, and pomegranate. Cattle ranching is another traditional branch of Nakhchivan farming. Due to the dry climate, pastures in Nakhchivan are unproductive, therefore sheep breeding prevails over other livestock production. Winter pastures stretch on the PriAraz plain, on the foothills and mountainsides to the altitude of . But the summer pastures go up on the high-mountain area to an altitude of . The most widespread sheep variety is &quot;balbas&quot;. These sheep are distinguished by their productivity and snow-white silky wool which is widely used in the manufacture of carpets. Horned and small cattle are bred everywhere, especially in the environs of Sharur and Nakhchivan. Buffaloes are also bred here.

Although intentions to facilitate tourism have been declared by the government, it is still at best incipient. Until 1997 tourists needed special permission to visit, which has now been abolished, making travel easier. Facilities are very basic and heating fuel is hard to find in the winter, but the arid mountains bordering Armenia and Iran are magnificent. In terms of services, Nakhchivan offers very basic facilities and lacks heating fuel during the winter.

In 2007 the Poldasht-Shah Takhti Bridge, which connects Poldasht, West Azerbaijan Province, Iran, and Shah Takhti in Nakhchivan, was completed, allowing residents of the republic to access Azerbaijan proper via Iran without having to cross Armenian territory.

== International issues ==

=== Destruction of Armenian cultural monuments ===

The number of named Armenian churches known to have existed in the Nakhchivan region is over 280. As early as 1648, French traveller Alexandre de Rhodes reported seeing more than ten thousand Armenian tombstones made of marble in Julfa. The number of ecclesiastical monuments still standing in Nakhchivan in the 1980s is estimated to be between 59 and 100. The author and journalist Sylvain Besson believe them to have all been subsequently destroyed as part of a campaign by the Government of Azerbaijan to erase all traces of Armenian culture on its soil.

When the 14th-century church of St. Stephanos at Abrakunis was visited in 2005, it was found to have been recently destroyed, with its site reduced to a few bricks sticking out of loose, bare earth. Similar complete destruction had happened to the 16th century St. Hakop-Hayrapet church in Shurut. The Armenian churches in Norashen, Kırna and Gah that were standing in the 1980s had also vanished.

The most publicised case of mass destruction concerns gravestones at a medieval cemetery in Julfa, with photographic, video and satellite evidence supporting the charges. In April 2006 British &quot;The Times&quot; wrote about the destruction of the cemetery in the following way:
A Medieval cemetery regarded as one of the wonders of the Caucasus has been erased from the Earth in an act of cultural vandalism likened to the Taleban blowing up the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan in 2001. The Jugha cemetery was a unique collection of several thousand carved stone crosses on Azerbaijan&#x27;s southern border with Iran. But after 18 years of conflict between Azerbaijan and its western neighbour, Armenia, it has been confirmed that the cemetery has vanished.&quot;

Armenians have long sounded the alarm that the Azerbaijanis intend to eliminate all evidence of Armenian presence in Nakhchivan and to this end, have been carrying out massive and irreversible destruction of Armenian cultural traces. &quot;The irony is that this destruction has taken place not during a time of war but at a time of peace,&quot; Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian told The Times. Azerbaijan has consistently denied these accusations. For example, according to the Azerbaijani ambassador to the US, Hafiz Pashayev, the videos and photographs &quot;show some unknown people destroying mid-size stones&quot;, and &quot;it is not clear of what nationality those people are&quot;, and the reports are Armenian propaganda designed to divert attention from what he claimed was a &quot;state policy (by Armenia) to destroy the historical and cultural monuments in the occupied Azeri territories&quot;.

A number of international organizations have confirmed the complete destruction of the cemetery. The Institute for War and Peace Reporting reported on April 19, 2006, that &quot;there is nothing left of the celebrated stone crosses of Jugha.&quot;

According to the International Council on Monuments and Sites (Icomos), the Azerbaijan government removed 800 khachkars in 1998. Though the destruction was halted following protests from UNESCO, it resumed four years later. By January 2003 &quot;the 1,500-year-old cemetery had completely been flattened&quot; according to Icomos. On December 8, 2010, the American Association for the Advancement of Science released a report entitled &quot;Satellite Images Show Disappearance of Armenian Artifacts in Azerbaijan&quot;. The report contained the analysis of high resolution satellite images of the Julfa cemetery, which verified the destruction of the khachkars.

The European Parliament has formally called on Azerbaijan to stop the demolition as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. According to its resolution regarding cultural monuments in the South Caucasus, the European Parliament &quot;condemns strongly the destruction of the Julfa cemetery as well as the destruction of all sites of historical importance that has taken place on Armenian or Azerbaijani territory, and condemns any such action that seeks to destroy cultural heritage.&quot; In 2006, Azerbaijan barred a Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) mission from inspecting and examining the ancient burial site, stating that it would only accept a delegation if it also visited Armenian-occupied territory. &quot;We think that if a comprehensive approach is taken to the problems that have been raised,&quot; said Azerbaijani foreign ministry spokesman Tahir Tagizade, &quot;it will be possible to study Christian monuments on the territory of Azerbaijan, including in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.&quot;

A renewed attempt was planned by PACE inspectors for August 29 – September 6, 2007, led by British MP Edward O&#x27;Hara. As well as Nakhchivan, the delegation would visit Baku, Yerevan, Tbilisi, and Nagorno Karabakh. The inspectors planned to visit Nagorno Karabakh via Armenia; however, on August 28, the head of the Azerbaijani delegation to PACE released a demand that the inspectors must enter Nagorno Karabakh via Azerbaijan. On August 29, PACE Secretary-General Mateo Sorinas announced that the visit had to be cancelled because of the difficulty in accessing Nagorno Karabakh using the route required by Azerbaijan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Armenia issued a statement saying that Azerbaijan had stopped the visit &quot;due solely to their intent to veil the demolition of Armenian monuments in Nakhijevan&quot;.

In 2022, the Cornell University-led monitoring group Caucasus Heritage Watch released a report detailing the &quot;complete destruction of Armenian cultural heritage&quot; in Nakhchivan starting the 1990s. According the report, out of 110 medieval and early modern Armenian monasteries, churches and cemeteries identified from archival sources, 108 were deliberately and systematically destroyed between 1997 and 2011. In some cases, such as the Saint Thomas Monastery in Yukhari Aylis (Agulis), mosques or other civic buildings were built on the site of the destroyed buildings.

=== Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ===
In the late 1990s the Supreme Assembly issued a non-binding declaration recognising the sovereignty of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) and calling upon Azerbaijan to do so. While sympathetic to the TRNC, Azerbaijan has not followed suit because doing so could prompt the Republic of Cyprus to recognise the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Close relations between Nakhchivan and Turkey probably initiated this recognition.

== Culture ==

Nakhchivan is one of the cultural centers of Azerbaijan. In 1923, a musical subgroup was organized at the State Drama Theater (renamed the Nakhchivan Music and Drama Theater in 1965). The Aras Song and Dance Ensemble (established in 1959) is another famous group. Dramatic performances staged by an amateur dance troupe were held in Nakhchivan in the late 19th century. Theatrical art also greatly contributed to Nakhchivan&#x27;s culture. The creative work of Jalil Mammadguluzadeh, Huseyn Javid, and Huseyn Arablinski (the first Azerbaijani theatre director) stemmed from Nakhchivan. The region has also produced noteworthy Armenian artists, too, such as Soviet actress Hasmik Agopyan. Nakhchivan has also at times been mentioned in works of literature. World-renowned Soviet composer Aram Khatchaturian, the Armenian Hovnatanian painter family, as well as the actor Yervand Manaryan, have shaped the cultural wealth of Nakchivan, too. Nizami, the Persian poet, once wrote:

::که تا جایگه یافتی نخچوان
::&quot;Oh Nakhchivan, respect you&#x27;ve attained,&quot;
::بدین شاه شد بخت پیرت جوان
::&quot;With this King in luck you&#x27;ll remain.&quot;
=== Media ===
Radio broadcasting in Nakhchivan began on 1 April 1932 under Soviet rule. Television broadcasting began later on 12 March 1963, with the launch of Nakhchivan TV. State-owned radio and television broadcasting in the autonomous republic is managed by the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The Nukhchikhan Information Agency was founded in 2018. Under the Ministry of Communications and New Technologies, the Voice of Nakhchivan radio network was founded in 2001 and the Kanal 35 television station was founded in 2004. Both ceased operations in May 2023.

== Archaeology ==
The very early Kura-Araxes culture flourished in Nakhchivan before spreading to many other areas, as far as Palestine. This region reveals the genesis and chronology of this Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age culture. Kültəpə is an important early Chalcolithic site in Nakhchivan. Another such site is Makhta Kultepe. Recent excavations at Ovcular Tepesi allow the dating of the initial stage of formation of Kura-Araxes culture to 4200–3400 BC.

The Naxçivan Archaeological Project is the first-ever joint American-Azerbaijani program of surveys and excavations, that was active since 2006. In 2010–11, they have excavated the large Iron Age fortress of Oğlanqala.

In Nakhchivan, there are also numerous archaeological monuments of the early Iron Age, and they shed a lot of light on the cultural, archaeological and agricultural developments of that era. There are important sites such as Ilikligaya, Irinchoy, and the Sanctuary of Iydali Piri in Kangarli region.

<text>Zalaegerszeg (; ; ; ) is the administrative center of Zala county in western Hungary.

==Location==
Zalaegerszeg lies on the banks of the Zala River, close to the Slovenian and Austrian borders, and west-southwest of Budapest by road.

==History==

The area was already inhabited in the Upper Paleolithic, according to archaeological findings (the oldest ones in Zala county). Later, the area was inhabited by Celts.

The first written mentions of the town are as &quot;Egerscug&quot; (1247) and &quot;Egerszeg&quot; (1293); the name means &quot;alder-tree corner&quot; and is probably a reference to the town&#x27;s situation in the angle where two rivers meet. King Béla IV donated the town to the diocese of Veszprém in 1266, so that it became Church property. As Egerszeg lay somewhat distant from Veszprém, however, the taxes paid by the town often ended up in the pockets of such local oligarchs as the Kőszegi family.

In the 14th century, Egerszeg was the largest town of the area. Between 1368 and 1389, it was a royal town for a short time, then Sigismund I donated it to the Kanizsai family who traded it for another town with the bishop of Veszprém. Zalaegerszeg remained their property until 1848.

In 1381, the town built a stone church. In 1421, Egerszeg was granted oppidum status, which meant they could pay taxes once a year and the citizens could elect their own judge. The population grew quickly, and by the 16th century, Egerszeg became the &quot;de facto&quot; centre of Zala comitatus.

In the 1530s, development was brought to a halt. Taking advantage of the power of the king being weakened, the owners of the surrounding lands attacked the town often, and the Ottomans already began to occupy Hungary after the Battle of Mohács in 1526. From 1568, the town was fortified, a castle was built. The Ottomans attacked the town for the first time in the late 1570s, but they failed to capture it.

After Kanizsa fell to the Ottomans, the strategic importance of Egerszeg grew, but the castle was severely damaged in 1616 and captured by the Ottomans for a short time in 1664. The citizens suffered not only from the war, but from plagues and heavy taxes as well.

Egerszeg, even though it was on the periphery of the comitatus, became its capital in the 18th century, mostly because the councils were always held there, because of its importance in the Ottoman times and because it wasn&#x27;t the estate of a local lord, unlike the other towns in Zala. The county hall was built between 1730 and 1732 in Baroque style, and for a long time it was the only significant building of the town. In the 1760s a large church and a barracks was built. Most of the citizens still did not own stone-built houses, and fires often destroyed the town, until 1826, when stone buildings were built.

Until the early 19th century, there were only a few craftsmen and merchants in the town, because they had to pay taxes to the bishop who owned the city. By the 1830s 10% of the residents of the mostly Catholic town were Jewish, but even they did not give a boost to trade. Because of this, even though the town was the centre of administration, economically and culturally it was not really important. Even though it had about 3,500 residents, it had only two primary schools. The cultural centres of the comitatus were Kanizsa and Keszthely.
Zalaegerszeg played only a minor role in the revolution and freedom fight in 1848–49. In 1870, it lost its town status and became a village, which meant a decrease in prestige, even more so since Nagykanizsa kept its town status. On 31 May 1885 Zalaegerszeg became a town again. In 1887, the village of Ola was annexed to the town. In 1890, the railway line between Ukk and Csáktornya (now Čakovec) connected Zalaegerszeg to the railway system of the country. In 1895, several new buildings were built, including a new secondary school, a town hall, a hotel, a nursery school and a brick factory, but the town ran into debt and the mayor, Károly Kovács, had to resign. His successor, Lajos Botfy, decreased the debt and could continue the development of the town, but in the early 20th century Zalaegerszeg was still behind the other county seats in many ways.

The representative at the Hungarian Parliament József Farkas de Boldogfa was a person of deep catholic and monarchist convictions, although he was a very tolerant and also responsible Parliament Representative: On 12 December 1901 József Farkas de Boldogfa led a delegation to Budapest to meet Baron Gyula Wlassics de Zalánkemén (1852–1937) Minister of Religion and Education to seek his support for building a Synagogue on Zalaegerszeg, relying on the fact that the minister, as a Zalaegerszeg native, is well aware of the situation of the local Jews&#x27; community. A couple of years after these negotiations the Synagogue of Zalaegerszeg was finished in 1904.

The 1920s brought prosperity again; new buildings included the new post office, the railway station, the office of the fire department, the police headquarters, the monastery of the Notre Dame Order and a synagogue in Baroque style.

The most significant loss in World War II was the deportation of the 1221 Jewish citizens to Auschwitz. The city was freed from the Nazis by the Red Army on 28 March 1945. In the next local elections in 1949, the local branch of the Communist party got only about 10% of the vote, but they still became the leaders of the city.

The 1950s brought important changes. Zalaegerszeg got a more industrial profile with the construction of the textile factory and the discovery of oil resources in 1952. The railway line was expanded, too. Many workers were commuting from the nearby villages, because it was almost impossible to find a flat in the city, so several residents of Zalaegerszeg (mostly those who were considered to be opposed to the Socialist system) were forced to relocate.

The citizens took part in the revolution in 1956. The revolution in the city began on 26 October. The communist local government fled to Körmend, and until the arrival of the Soviet troops (November 4) the city was governed by the Revolutionary Council.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the city experienced a demographic explosion. Several new flats were built, new residents moved into them, and the growing city absorbed many surrounding villages (Csácsbozsok, Botfa, Zalabesenyő, Bazita, Andráshida, and Pózva). Albeit at a slower pace, it continues to expand toward the settlements of Bocfölde and Bagod.

<doc id="385369" wikidata="Q3128742" url="?curid=385369" title="Hawaii Bowl">
<text>The Hawaii Bowl is a college football bowl game that has been played in the Honolulu, Hawaii, area since 2002. The game was originally held at Aloha Stadium in Halawa, Hawaii, a suburb of Honolulu, before moving to the Clarence T. C. Ching Athletics Complex in 2022. The bowl is one of the post-season contests run by ESPN Events. Typically played on or near Christmas Eve, the bowl normally features a team from the Mountain West Conference, playing a team from either the American Athletic Conference or Conference USA.

For practical and logistical reasons, the Mountain West Conference&#x27;s tie-in is automatically allocated to the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors if the team is bowl-eligible, and was not selected to play in a New Year&#x27;s Six (or previously, BCS) bowl game. This means that the Rainbow Warriors do not have to travel to the mainland for a bowl game unless it is of significant importance. As a result of this practice, the Rainbow Warriors have made the most appearances in the game, at nine.

For the 2021 through 2023 editions, the bowl was sponsored by EasyPost. Previous sponsors include ConAgra Foods (2002) and Sheraton Hotels and Resorts Hawaii (2003–2013), and SoFi (2018–2019).

==Bowl games in Hawaii==
The Hawaii Bowl is not affiliated with other bowl games previously staged in Hawaii: the Poi Bowl (1936–1939), Pineapple Bowl (1940–1941, 1947–1952), Aloha Bowl (1982–2000), and Oahu Bowl (1998–2000), or the Hula Bowl all-star game (1960–2008, and resuming in 2020). While the Aloha Bowl tried to move to San Francisco, California, and was decertified by the NCAA, the Oahu Bowl was moved to Seattle, Washington, and was held for two years as the Seattle Bowl before losing certification in 2002.

==Game history==
In its first year, the Hawai&#x27;i Bowl was sponsored by ConAgra Foods, making it officially the ConAgra Foods Hawai&#x27;i Bowl. The following year, Sheraton Hotels and Resorts Hawaii assumed sponsorship; the game&#x27;s full name was changed to the Sheraton Hawai&#x27;i Bowl until Sheraton declined to renew sponsorship in 2014. In 2018, SoFi signed on as title sponsor of the game which is officially known as the SoFi Hawai&#x27;i Bowl.

The current Mountain West tie-in was held by the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) until 2012, when the WAC ceased sponsoring college football, and Hawaii moved to the Mountain West.

The first two editions were played on the Aloha Bowl&#x27;s traditional Christmas Day date, but ESPN&#x27;s acquisition of NBA rights came with the league&#x27;s Christmas Day games, thus the game moved to Christmas Eve after 2004 in most years.

The 2005 appearance of the UCF Knights at the Hawaii Bowl was the first ever bowl game in that school&#x27;s history. In 2006, the Pac-10 replaced Conference USA (C-USA) as the WAC&#x27;s opposition, with C-USA as an alternate. Since Christmas Eve fell on a Monday in 2007, the game was scheduled for the night prior (December 23) to avoid a conflict with &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; (also on ESPN). In 2008, the bowl organizers selected Notre Dame as an at-large bid, marking the first time an independent played in the contest. C-USA again became a primary tie-in starting in 2009. The 2011 game featured the C-USA champion for the first time, as Southern Mississippi played instead of going to the Liberty Bowl, where the C-USA champion typically played at the time. The bowl featured the Mountain West champion for the first time in 2015, as San Diego State played instead of going to the Las Vegas Bowl, where the Mountain West champion typically plays.

Between 2002 and 2018, C-USA sent a team to the bowl 12 times, registering an 8–4 record. In 2019, the American Athletic Conference (The American) superseded C-USA as the primary tie-in to face a Mountain West team (or independent BYU).

On October 2, ESPN Events announced that the 2020 edition of the bowl game had been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On August 10, 2021, EasyPost was announced as the new sponsor of the bowl, making it the EasyPost Hawai&#x27;i Bowl. EasyPost remained the sponsor through the 2023 edition.

On December 23, 2021, the game was cancelled for the second consecutive season, after the Rainbow Warriors withdrew due to injuries and COVID-19 issues within the team.

The 2024 edition of the bowl took five overtime periods to decide, setting a new record for the most overtime periods in a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) bowl game. However, this record was surpassed just two days later when the 2024 GameAbove Sports Bowl took six overtimes to decide.

=== (2011)===
To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Hawai&#x27;i Bowl, the &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot;, in conjunction with the bowl game, allowed fans to vote on a tenth anniversary team. Nine players were selected by a public vote, and an additional seven players were picked by a panel of sportswriters and organizers. The team was announced on December 16, 2011.

<text>Aquilonia is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Avellino, part of the Campania region of southern Italy. It is situated in mountainous terrain in the eastern part of the province, at an elevation of .

==History==
The Lombards called the town Carbonara or Carunar, supposedly because a major local occupation was charcoal making. In 1861, after the unification of Italy, the town was renamed &quot;Aquilonia&quot; based on a 16th-century assumption that this was the site of the Battle of Aquilonia between the Rome and the Samnites.

On 23 July 1930 a major earthquake destroyed the town, and it was rebuilt at a higher location nearby.

==Geography==
Located in the eastern side of the province, close to Basilicata, Aquilonia borders with the municipalities of Bisaccia, Calitri, Lacedonia, Melfi, Monteverde and Rionero in Vulture.

==Twin towns — sister cities==
Aquilonia is twinned with:

<doc id="385385" wikidata="Q1438830" url="?curid=385385" title="Fort William, Ontario">
<text>Fort William was a city in Ontario, Canada, located on the Kaministiquia River, at its entrance to Lake Superior. It amalgamated with Port Arthur and the townships of Neebing and McIntyre to form the city of Thunder Bay in January 1970. Since then, it has been the largest city in Northwestern Ontario. The city&#x27;s Latin motto was &quot;A posse ad esse&quot; (&quot;From a possibility to an actuality&quot;), featured on its coat of arms designed in 1900 by town officials, &quot;On one side of the shield stands an Indian dressed in the paint and feathers of the early days; on the other side is a French voyageur; the cent[re] contains a grain elevator, a steamship and a locomotive, while the beaver surmounts the whole.&quot;

==History==

===Fur trade era===
Fort William and Grand Portage were the two starting points for the canoe route from the Great Lakes to Western Canada. For details of the route inland see Kaministiquia River.

====French period (Fort Kaministiquia)====
Kamanistigouian, as a place, is first mentioned in a decree of the Conseil Souverain de la Nouvelle-France dated 23 August 1681 instructing one of two canoes to make known the king&#x27;s amnesty to coureurs de bois, although the Kaministiquia River is depicted on the 1671 &quot;Carte des Jésuites&quot; as &quot;R. [rivière] par où l&#x27;on va aux Assinipoualacs à 120 lieues vers le Nord-Ouest.&quot; In late 1683 or spring 1684, Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, established a trading post near the mouth of the Kaministiquia River. French authorities closed this post in 1696 because of a glut on the fur market. In 1717, a new post, Fort Kaministiquia, was established at the river mouth by Zacharie Robutel de la Noue. This post appears on 18th century French maps by Royal hydrographer Jacques-Nicolas Bellin as &quot;Fort Caministogoyan&quot;. The post was abandoned in 1758 or 1760 during the British conquest of New France.

====English period (Fort William)====
The fur trade was quickly re-established with most people using Grand Portage. By 1784, Montreal merchants and their &quot;wintering partners&quot; had formed the North West Company (Nor&#x27;Westers). The North West Company continued to use Grand Portage as their centre of operations after the area was ceded to the United States after the colonists&#x27; victory in the American Revolution. Following the signing of the Jay Treaty of 1794 between Great Britain and the United States, which acknowledged American control of the area, the North West Company required a new midway transshipment point between their inland posts and Montreal. The partners needed to meet and exchange furs and supplies without being subject to American taxation.
In 1803, the Nor&#x27;Westers abandoned Grand Portage and established a new fur trading post on the Kaministiquia River on land acquired from the Ojibwe by written agreement 30 July 1798. The post was named Fort William in 1807 after William McGillivray, chief director of the North West Company from 1804-1821. After the union of the North West Company with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) in 1821, the fort lost its &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; because most trade shifted to York Factory on Hudson Bay. It became a minor HBC fur trading post. The original site disappeared under development of Canadian Pacific Railway]] railroad tracks and coal piles in the 1880s. A replica of Fort William was built further upstream on the Kaministiquia River at Pointe de Meuron, a former military staging location named after Lord Selkirk&#x27;s Swiss de Meuron Regiment. It is now known as the Fort William Historical Park.

===19th century and after===
Two townships (Neebing and Paipoonge) and the Fort William Town Plot were surveyed in 1859–1860 by the Province of Canada&#x27;s Department of Crown Lands and opened to settlement. A large section of land adjacent to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post remained in dispute until 1875, when it was surveyed as Neebing Additional Township. Most land was acquired by absentee landowners speculating on the decision of the new Dominion of Canada to build a railway to the Pacific that would begin somewhere along the north shore of Lake Superior. The selection of the Fort William Town Plot (later known as West Fort) as the eastern terminus for the CPR stimulated development, as did the construction of the railway, begun in June 1875. The federal Department of Public Works, and later the Department of Railways and Canals, took seven years (1875–1882) to build the Thunder Bay Branch from Fort William to Winnipeg, Manitoba.

The Ontario Legislature incorporated the Municipality of Shuniah in March 1873. This early form of regional government comprised a vast area from Sibley Peninsula to the American border. For eight years the residents of Neebing and Neebing Additional townships battled Port Arthur residents for the Thunder Bay terminus. In March 1881, the inhabitants of Neebing and Neebing Additional petitioned the Ontario Legislature successfully to separate the southern townships from Shuniah and to create the Municipality of Neebing.

By 1883–1884, the Montreal-based CPR syndicate, in collaboration with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, clearly preferred the low-lying lands along the lower Kaministiquia River to the exposed shores of Port Arthur, which required an expensive breakwater if shipping and port facilities were to be protected from the waves. The CPR subsequently consolidated all its operations there, erecting rail yards, coal-handling facilities, grain elevators and a machine shop. In April 1892, Neebing Additional Township and parts of Neebing Township were incorporated as the town of Fort William. Fort William was incorporated as a city in April 1907. The city of Fort William ceased to exist at the end of December 1969.

<doc id="385386" wikidata="Q505815" url="?curid=385386" title="Trappist beer">
<text>Trappist beer is brewed by Trappist monks. Thirteen Trappist monasteries—six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands, and one each in Austria, Italy, England, France, and Spain— produce beer, but the &quot;Authentic Trappist Product&quot; label is assigned by the International Trappist Association (ITA) to just ten breweries that meet their strict criteria. , Achel is no longer recognized as a Trappist brewery because it does not have any monks.
==History==
The Catholic Trappist order originated in the Cistercian monastery of La Trappe, France. Various Cistercian congregations existed for many years, and by 1664 the abbot of La Trappe felt that the Cistercians were becoming too liberal. He introduced strict new rules in the abbey and the Strict Observance was born. Since this time, many of the rules have been relaxed. However, a fundamental tenet that monasteries should be self-supporting is still maintained by these groups.

Monastery brewhouses, from different religious orders, have existed across Europe since the Middle Ages. From the very beginning, beer was brewed in French Cistercian monasteries following the Strict Observance. For example, the monastery of La Trappe in Soligny already had its own brewery in 1685. Breweries were later introduced in monasteries of other countries as the Trappist order spread from France into the rest of Europe. The Trappists, like many other religious orders, originally brewed beer to feed the community, in a show of self-sufficiency. Nowadays, Trappist breweries also brew beer to fund their works and charitable causes. Many of the Trappist monasteries and breweries were destroyed during the French Revolution and the World Wars. In the last 300 years, there were at least nine Trappist breweries in France, six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands, one in Germany, one in Austria, one in Bosnia and possibly other countries.

In 1997, eight Trappist abbeyssix from Belgium (Orval, Chimay, Westvleteren, Rochefort, Westmalle and Achel), one from the Netherlands (Koningshoeven) and one from Germany (Mariawald)founded the International Trappist Association (ITA) to prevent non-Trappist commercial companies from abusing the Trappist name. This private association created a logo that is assigned to goods (cheese, beer, wine, etc.) that respect precise production criteria. For the beers, these criteria were the following:
* The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery, either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.
* The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way of life.
* The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture. The income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance of the buildings and grounds. Whatever remains is donated to charity for social work and to help persons in need.

The German Trappist abbey of Mariawald has not produced beer since 1953, however it is a founding member of the Trappist Association and uses the same &quot;Authentic Trappist Product&quot; logo for its other products.

As of January 2021, Belgium has only five Trappist beers (ATP) left since Achel lost its ATP designation due to the last monk leaving the Order. However, its beer production is still ongoing and has been taken over by Westmalle. In 2012, Bpost honored the Trappist breweries in the country with a commemorative collection of stamps. In January 2023, Achel lost its designation as a Trappist beer due to selling the abbey to a private person.

In the twentieth century, the growing popularity of Trappist beers led some brewers with no connection to the order to label their beers &quot;Trappist&quot;. After unsuccessful negotiations, monks sued one such brewer in 1962 in Ghent, Belgium.

The Dutch brewery &quot;De Koningshoeven&quot; produces Trappist beersbranded &quot;La Trappe&quot;that are able to carry the &quot;Authentic Trappist Product&quot; logo. Their use of the International Trappist Association logo was withdrawn in 1999, but was restored in October 2005 (see Brouwerij de Koningshoeven for details). A second Dutch Trappist beer, branded &quot;Zundert&quot; and produced by Abdij Maria Toevlucht, made its debut in December 2013, and has also been granted permission to use the International Trappist Association logo.

An expansion of ITA-recognized breweries took place for the first time in 2012 when the trappist brewery of the abbey of Trappistenbrauerei Engelszell in Engelhartszell, Austria, started brewing beer at the monastery (the former production had stopped in 1929) and in the same year obtained the &quot;Authentic Trappist Product&quot; logo for their beer.

In December 2013, Maria Toevlucht&#x27;s Abbey (Zundert, the Netherlands) and St. Joseph&#x27;s Abbey (Spencer, Massachusetts, United States) were both granted the ATP recognition for their Trappist beers, followed in 2015 by Tre Fontane Abbey brewery in Rome.

In June 2018, the monks of Mount Saint Bernard Abbey in Leicestershire became the first in the UK to brew a Trappist ale. Called &quot;Tynt Meadow&quot; (7.4% ABV), after the location of the abbey, it is available to visitors and sold through public outlets.

==International Trappist Association recognised breweries==
=== Authentic Trappist Product label ===
In addition to being a Trappist brewery, the monastic communities that are members of the ITA can apply for the &quot;Authentic Trappist Product&quot; (ATP) label. The following criteria are used for ATP label:
*All products must be made within the immediate surroundings of the abbey;
*Production must be carried out under the supervision of the monks or nuns;
*Profits should be intended for the needs of the monastic community, for purposes of solidarity within the Trappist Order, or for development projects and charitable works.

===List of Trappist breweries===
There are currently thirteen breweries producing Trappist beer. Ten of them (with the exception of Achel, Mont des Cats, whose beer is not brewed at their monastery but at Chimay, and Cardeña from the Abbey of San Pedro de Cardeña, whose beer is currently produced off-site) are allowed to display the &quot;Authentic Trappist Product&quot; logo on their beer products.
In January 2021, &quot;Achel&quot; of the St. Benedict&#x27;s Abbey in Hamont-Achel lost the Authentic Trappist Product label, as the brewing process was no longer supervised by monks &quot;on site&quot;, but the beer remains a Trappist beer, as the Saint Benedict Abbey falls under the Westmalle Abbey and the abbot of Westmalle Abbey visits the Achelse Kluis every week and supervises the brewing and other activities in the Achelse Kluis. In January 2023, the abbey was sold to a private person. From that day on, &quot;Achel&quot; lost the recognition as a Trappist beer. In May 2022, St. Joseph&#x27;s Abbey ceased beer production. In May 2023, Stift Engelszell published an article about dissolution of the monastery and move all monks to other monasteries.



==Abbey beer==
The designation &quot;abbey beers&quot; (&quot;Bières d&#x27;Abbaye&quot; or &quot;Abdijbier&quot;) was originally devised by Belgian breweries for any monastic or monastic-style beer not produced in an actual monastery. After the introduction of an official Trappist beer designation by the International Trappist Association in 1997, it came to mean products similar in style or presentation to monastic beers. In other words, an Abbey beer may be:
* Produced by a non-Trappist monasterye.g. non-Trappist Cistercian or Benedictine; or
* produced by a commercial brewery under an arrangement with an extant monastery; or
* branded with the name of a defunct or fictitious abbey by a commercial brewer; or
* given a vaguely monastic branding, without specifically mentioning monastery, by a commercial brewer.

==Types of beer==
Trappist beers are mostly top-fermented, including La Trappe Bockbier, and mainly bottle conditioned. Trappist breweries use various systems of nomenclature for the different beers produced which relate to their relative strength.

The best known is the system where different beers are called &quot;Enkel/Single&quot;, &quot;Dubbel/Double&quot;, &quot;Tripel/Triple&quot; and &quot;Quadrupel/Quadruple&quot;. These terms roughly describe both the amount of malt and the original gravity. They may refer to the number of crosses or other marks chalked on the casks - two for a Dubbel and three for a Tripel.

Colours can be used to indicate the different types, dating back to the days when bottles were unlabelled and had to be identified by the &quot;capsule&quot; or bottle-top alone. Chimay beer labels are based on the colour system (in increasing order of strength red, white and blue). Westvleteren beers are still unlabelled.

There is also a number system (6, 8 and 10, as used by Rochefort), which gives an indication of strength, but is not necessarily an exact alcohol by volume (ABV). Achel combine a strength and a colour (of the beer itselfblond or brown) designation.

===Enkel===
Enkel, meaning &quot;single&quot;, is a term used by the Trappist breweries to describe the basic recipe of their beers. The term is often used interchangeably with patersbier (meaning father&#x27;s beer), as Enkels are a weak beer brewed originally to be consumed by the monks themselves. The name fell out of fashion with no breweries (Trappist or &#x27;Abbey&#x27;) using the term until recent years. Instead, &quot;Blond(e)&quot; (La Trappe, Westvleteren), &quot;5&quot; (Achel) or &quot;6&quot; (Rochefort) have been used to describe the brewery&#x27;s lightest beer. Chimay introduced an Enkel (called &quot;Dorée&quot; or Gold) commercially in bottles in 2015, Westmalle made their Enkel (called &quot;Extra&quot;) available commercially through some outlets in 2010.

===Dubbel===

Dubbel is a Trappist breweries&#x27; naming convention. The origin of the dubbel was a beer brewed in the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle in 1856. Westmalle Dubbel was imitated by other breweries, Trappist and commercial, Belgian and worldwide, leading to the emergence of a style. Dubbels are understood to be a fairly strong (6–8% ABV) brown ale, with understated bitterness, fairly heavy body, and a pronounced fruitiness and cereal character.
Examples are: Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red/Premiere, Koningshoeven/La Trappe Dubbel, Achel 8 Bruin, Rochefort 6, and Tynt Meadow.

===Tripel===

Tripel is a naming convention traditionally used by Belgian Trappist breweries to describe the strongest beer in their range. Westmalle Tripel is considered to be the foundation of this beer style, and was developed in the 1930s. Achel 8 Blond, Westmalle Tripel, La Trappe Tripel, and Chimay White/Cinq Cents are all examples of Trappist tripels. The style has proven popular among secular breweries like St. Feuillien, Bosteels and St. Bernardus. Tripels as a style are generally beers with an alcohol content ranging from 8% to 10% ABV.

===Quadrupel===

Quadrupel is the name Koningshoeven gave to a La Trappe ale they brew which is stronger and darker than their tripel. Rochefort 10, Westvleteren 12 and Zundert 10 are also examples of quadrupels.

==Glassware==
Belgian breweries have a tradition of providing custom beer glasses: with Trappist breweries, these often take the form of &quot;chalice&quot; or &quot;goblet&quot; style glasses. The distinction between goblet and chalice is typically in the glass thickness. Goblets tend to be more delicate and thin, while the chalice is heavy and thick walled. Some chalices are etched on the bottom to nucleate a stream of bubbles for maintaining a nice head.

==Beer tourism==
The idea of visiting Trappist monasteries to sample their beers has become more popular in recent years, partly due to promotion by enthusiasts such as the &#x27;beer hunter&#x27; Michael Jackson. Some brewing monasteries maintain a visitors&#x27; centre where their beers can be tasted and bought (sometimes with other monastic products such as bread and cheese). Visits to the monastery itself are usually not available to the general public, although visitors can overnight in some of the monasteries (like Achel) if their purpose is non-touristic. Currently, Koningshoeven (which brews La Trappe) in Netherlands offers regular tours around their bottling plant, old brewery and parts of their site, along with a beer tasting.

<doc id="385393" wikidata="Q14817956" url="?curid=385393" title="Nucleoplasm">
<text>The nucleoplasm, also known as karyoplasm, is the type of protoplasm that makes up the cell nucleus, the most prominent organelle of the eukaryotic cell. It is enclosed by the nuclear envelope, also known as the nuclear membrane. The nucleoplasm resembles the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell in that it is a gel-like substance found within a membrane, although the nucleoplasm only fills out the space in the nucleus and has its own unique functions. The nucleoplasm suspends structures within the nucleus that are not membrane-bound and is responsible for maintaining the shape of the nucleus. The structures suspended in the nucleoplasm include chromosomes, various proteins, nuclear bodies, the nucleolus, nucleoporins, nucleotides, and nuclear speckles.

The soluble, liquid portion of the nucleoplasm is called the karyolymph nucleosol, or nuclear hyaloplasm.

== History ==

The existence of the nucleus, including the nucleoplasm, was first documented as early as 1682 by the Dutch microscopist Leeuwenhoek and was later described and drawn by Franz Bauer. However, the cell nucleus was not named and described in detail until Robert Brown&#x27;s presentation to the Linnean Society in 1831. 
The nucleoplasm, while described by Bauer and Brown, was not specifically isolated as a separate entity until its naming in 1882 by Polish-German scientist Eduard Strasburger, one of the most famous botanists of the 19th century, and the first person to discover mitosis in plants.

== Role ==
Many important cell functions take place in the nucleus, more specifically in the nucleoplasm. The main function of the nucleoplasm is to provide the proper environment for essential processes that take place in the nucleus, serving as the suspension substance for all organelles inside the nucleus, and storing the structures that are used in these processes. 34% of proteins encoded in the human genome are ones that localize to the nucleoplasm. These proteins take part in RNA transcription and gene regulation in the nucleoplasm. Proteins located in the nucleoplasm are involved in the activation of genes that are used in the cell cycle. Some nucleoporins which typically make up the nuclear pore, can be mobile and participate in the regulation of gene expression in the nucleoplasm. The nuclear pore is where molecules travel from inside the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm and vice versa. The nucleoplasm is also a route for many molecules to travel through. Smaller molecules are able to pass freely through the nuclear pore to get into and out of the nucleoplasm, while larger proteins need the help of receptors on the surface of the nuclear envelope.
The nuclear matrix is also believed to be contained in the nucleoplasm where it functions to maintain the size and shape of the nucleus, in a role similar to that of the cytoskeleton found in the cytoplasm. However, the existence and the exact function of the nuclear matrix remain unclear and heavily debated.

== Composition ==
The nucleoplasm is a highly viscous liquid that is enveloped by the nuclear membrane and consists mainly of water, proteins, dissolved ions, and a variety of other substances including nucleic acids and minerals.

=== Proteins ===
There are around 20,000 protein-coding genes in humans, and nearly a third of these have been found to localize to the nucleoplasm via targeting by a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Cytosolic proteins, known as importins, act as receptors for the NLS, escorting the protein to a nuclear pore complex to be transported into the nucleoplasm. Proteins in the nucleoplasm are mainly tasked with participating in and regulating cellular functions that are DNA-dependent, including transcription, RNA splicing, DNA repair, DNA replication, and a variety of metabolic processes. These proteins are divided into histone proteins, a class of proteins that bind to DNA and give chromosomes their shape and regulate gene activity, and non-histone proteins.

The nucleoplasm contains many enzymes that are instrumental in the synthesis of DNA and RNA, including DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which function in DNA replication and RNA transcription, respectively. Additionally, the nucleoplasm is host to many of the enzymes that play essential roles in cellular metabolism. NAD+ synthase is stored in the nucleoplasm and functions in electron transport and redox reactions involved with the electron transport chain and synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate kinase is also found in the nucleoplasm in significant quantities; this enzyme is involved in the final step of glycolysis, catalyzing the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate along with the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to ATP. Importantly, the nucleoplasm contains co-factors and co-enzymes, including acetyl-CoA, which plays a vital role in the citric acid cycle, and ATP, which is involved in energy storage and transfer.

=== Ions ===

The ionic composition of the nucleoplasm is crucial in maintaining homeostasis within the cell and the organism as a whole. Ions that have been documented in the nucleoplasm include sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. These ions are key players in a variety of biological functions. Sodium and potassium play key roles in the sodium-potassium pump, a transmembrane ATPase that pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it pumps into the cell, creating an ionic gradient. While this pump is generally considered to be a plasma membrane protein, its presence has been recorded in the nuclear envelope, controlling the ionic gradient between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of the cell and contributing to the homeostasis of calcium within the cell. These ions also determine the concentration gradient that exists between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, serving to control the flow of ions across the nuclear envelope. They are important in maintaining the osmolarity of the nucleoplasm which in turn provides structural integrity to the nuclear envelope as well as the organelles suspended in the dense nucleoplasm.

== Similarity to cytoplasm ==
Nucleoplasm is quite similar to the cytoplasm, with the main difference being that nucleoplasm is found inside the nucleus while the cytoplasm is located inside the cell, outside of the nucleus. Their ionic compositions are nearly identical due to the ion pumps and permeability of the nuclear envelope, however, the proteins in these two fluids differ greatly. Proteins in the cytoplasm are termed cytosolic proteins which are produced by free ribosomes while proteins that localize to the nucleoplasm must undergo processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus before being delivered to the nucleoplasm as part of the secretory pathway. These proteins also differ in function, as proteins that localize to the nucleoplasm are largely involved in DNA-dependent processes including cell division and gene regulation, while cytosolic proteins are mainly involved in protein modification, mRNA degradation, metabolic processes, signal transduction, and cell death.

The cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm are both highly gelatinous structures enclosed by membranous structures- the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope, respectively. However, while the cytoplasm is contained by a single lipid bilayer membrane, the nuclear envelope that compartmentalizes the nucleoplasm consists of two separate lipid bilayers- an outer membrane and an inner membrane. 
The cytoplasm is also found in all known cells while nucleoplasm is only found in eukaryotic cells, as prokaryotic cells lack a well-defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Additionally, during cell division, the cytoplasm divides during cytokinesis, while the nucleoplasm is released with the dissolution of the nuclear envelope, refilling only after the nuclear envelope reforms.

The organelles and other structures within the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm are organized by protein filaments within their respective compartments. The cytoplasm contains the cytoskeleton, a network of protein filaments found in all cells, while the nucleoplasm is believed to contain the nuclear matrix, a hypothetically analogous network of filaments that organizes the organelles and genetic information within the nucleus. While the structure and function of the cytoskeleton have been well documented, the exact function, and even the presence, of the nuclear matrix is disputed. While the exact composition of the nuclear matrix has not been confirmed, type V intermediate filaments, known as nuclear lamins, have been documented in the nucleoplasm, functioning in the structural support of the nucleus as well as the regulation of DNA replication, transcription, and chromatin organization. Cytoplasmic streaming, the circular flow of cytoplasm driven by the cytoskeleton, has been well documented in the cytoplasm, aiding in intracellular transport, but this process has not been documented in the nucleoplasm.

<doc id="385397" wikidata="Q664976" url="?curid=385397" title="Fungus Amongus">
<text>Fungus Amongus is the debut studio album by American rock band Incubus, released on November 1, 1995, by Chillum Records, Incubus&#x27; own independent label. It was later re-released under Epic and Immortal Records on November 7, 2000, after popular demand.

==Background==
Incubus formed in 1991, while its members were still in high school, and recorded several demos over the next few years. In 2017, drummer José Pasillas described &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; as &quot;our first concerted effort at putting a group of songs together on an LP&quot;. However, guitarist Mike Einziger has said that he views it as a compilation of demos they had recorded while in high school, rather than as a cohesive studio album. He stated in 2017, &quot;making recordings back then was really challenging, especially for a bunch of high school kids. We didn&#x27;t have access to anything. We didn&#x27;t have money to make recordings. We didn&#x27;t have a studio. We didn&#x27;t have any equipment. We didn&#x27;t know how to use the equipment. But we slowly began to meet certain people. We ended up working with a producer who owned a recording studio.&quot; Einziger also claimed in 2011 that the writing process was different to later records, since the band hadn&#x27;t done any touring yet at that time. He said, &quot;it&#x27;s definitely different when you&#x27;re in kind of a closed environment and writing music for your friends, which is what I think we were doing in our pre-&quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; days.&quot; Incubus had trouble attracting the interest of major labels during their early years, which led to them releasing &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; independently in 1995. The band printed 1,000 copies and sold all of them. Vocalist Brandon Boyd remembered in 2020, &quot;It was a win for us, but let me tell you like selling 1,000 copies was hard. When we did get to work with a major label, it was definitely exciting.&quot;

The album cover image is of a fly agaric mushroom. Many of the names given under &quot;Personnel&quot; are actually pseudonyms for the band members. &quot;Fabio&quot; is Mike Einziger; &quot;Dirk Lance&quot; is bassist Alex Katunich, who later adopted the moniker as his stage name; &quot;Brandy Flower&quot; is an actual Sony employee; and &quot;Happy Knappy&quot; is Brandon Boyd. &quot;Bett&quot; and &quot;Brett Spivery&quot; refer to Brett Spivey, longtime friend of the band, who went on to make their first two DVDs and the videos for &quot;I Miss You&quot; and &quot;Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)&quot;.

&quot;Hilikus&quot;, &quot;Shaft!&quot;, &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot;, and &quot;You Will Be a Hot Dancer&quot; were all re-recorded for the 1997 &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; EP, which was the band&#x27;s first release after signing to Epic/Immortal Records in 1996. The EP also included additional material, such as a new song called &quot;Version&quot;. The re-recordings of the &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; tracks featured added DJ scratches by DJ Lyfe, who joined Incubus in late 1995, after &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; had been released. The re-recording of &quot;Hilikus&quot; had a new, untitled hidden track, which plays after several minutes of silence. On this release, some of the band members were given new pseudonyms; Einziger&#x27;s was &quot;Dynamike&quot;, Boyd&#x27;s was &quot;Brandon of the Jungle&quot;, and DJ Lyfe&#x27;s was &quot;Kid Lyfe&quot;. On &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; the band continued to create new pseudonyms, before abandoning this concept on later releases.

===Music and lyrics===
Stylistically, &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; shows strong influences of funk metal bands such as Faith No More, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Primus, and Mr. Bungle, most of whom are mentioned in the liner notes of the 2000 reissue. In subsequent interviews, Boyd has cited all of these artists as influences on the band and has mentioned his enjoyment at later having Incubus perform alongside them, including with Mr. Bungle at the 2000 SnoCore Tour and with Faith No More at the 2015 Soundwave Festival in Australia. In a 1995 review of an Incubus concert, Traci Esslinger of &quot;Music Connection&quot; magazine described their sound as &quot;funk-thrash&quot; , noting that the &quot;vast majority of songs begin with oozing funk grooves&quot;. The group also presents a quasi-rap style on &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;, which continued onto 1997&#x27;s &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, showing Boyd rapping on songs such as &quot;Psychopsilocybin&quot;, &quot;Trouble in 421&quot;, &quot;Speak Free&quot;, and &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot;. 

&quot;Medium&quot; begins with an unknown woman doing an acapella vocal melody reminiscent of a piece of music from a 1939 Looney Tunes short titled &quot;Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur&quot;. Since &quot;Medium&quot; wasn&#x27;t re-recorded for &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot;, the woman&#x27;s vocal melody would be added to the end of the re-recorded version of &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot;, which on &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; is the track that proceeds &quot;Medium&quot;. The opening track, &quot;You Will Be a Hot Dancer&quot;, includes the line &quot;let&#x27;s get this Marmaduke naked&quot;, which is a reference to the comic strip dog of the same name. The song &quot;Shaft!&quot; references Lorena Bobbitt, an American woman who gained notoriety for cutting off her husband&#x27;s penis in 1993. 

Boyd reflected in a 2012 interview that &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; was &quot;a very accurate statement of where we were at that time. We were teenagers and had little to no knowledge or understanding of the world. We were learning how to write songs and be a band and had no concept or idea that those recordings would stick. It was almost outsider art. I think &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; were Incubus still finding our distinctive voice. So those albums are schizoid amalgamations of many of the bands we were obsessing over in the early to mid-nineties.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==
Upon initial release, the album failed to chart; however, when re-released in 2000 by Epic/Immortal Records, it managed to peak at number 116 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album received generally negative reviews from critics. Dean Carlson of AllMusic wrote, &quot;Incubus&#x27; independent debut is an unremarkable take on suburban MTV funk.&quot; He also criticized frontman Brandon Boyd, writing, &quot;there&#x27;s much to dislike, notably frontman Brandon Boyd, who growls like he wants the voice of anybody but himself&quot;. Tim Grierson of About.com observed, &quot;at this early stage, Incubus just sounded like a tired rehash of Rage Against the Machine and Red Hot Chili Peppers.&quot; In 2001, &quot;Spin&quot; labeled the album as &quot;goofy&quot; and &quot;Primus-obsessed.&quot;

&quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) gave the album one star out of five. The review states, &quot;although it may only be vaguely recalled, the great funk metal scare occurred at the dawn of the 90s, between the waning of hair metal and the waxing of grunge.&quot; It adds that &quot;Incubus was a latecomer to a boomlet of shirtless suburban funkateers who were greatly inspired by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Primus and Faith No More&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;, a compendium of slapped bass and forced wackiness, seemed hopelessly dated in 1995.&quot; The 2003 book &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; describes the album as &quot;a rough-and-ready amalgam of funk, rock, metal and wilful weirdness that merely hinted at what Incubus would go on to produce.&quot; Frank Guan of &quot;Vulture&quot; stated in 2017 that it was &quot;a sincere and skilled pastiche of their funk-drunk idols&quot; and characterized its lyrical content as having &quot;references to 4/20, space aliens, and psilocybin mushrooms.&quot;

In 2020, Ultimate Guitar included it on their list of &quot;Top 8 Iconic Funk Metal Albums&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; added it to a list titled &quot;26 Bands Who Sound Nothing Like Their First Album&quot;. They stated, &quot;taking cues from Faith No More, Primus and hip-hop, the funk-first rap/rock of &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; was a snapshot of heavy music in 1995.&quot;

When looking back on Incubus&#x27;s discography in a 2017 interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Boyd observed, &quot;[&quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;] was super-fun to make, but we didn&#x27;t know what we were doing. I guess that&#x27;s why a lot of our fans love that record, but for me when I hear it I truly cringe. I would just as soon bury it forever.&quot; In a 2022 &quot;Louder Sound&quot; article, Boyd placed it last in his ranking of the eight Incubus studio albums. He said, &quot;it doesn’t feel like a studio album. It was barely mixed and recorded — &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; was the first time we had a recording budget.&quot; When ranking the band&#x27;s eight studio albums in 2020, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; placed &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; seventh, ahead of only their 2011 album, &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; placed it fifth in their ranking, saying that &quot;while the band could surely play, nothing was polished or breakthrough quite yet.&quot;

==Live performance==
The band has not performed any songs from &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; or &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; since 2004. That year, they performed &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot; nine times on their &quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot; tour, having then not played it since 1998. Their last performances of any of the other &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; songs were in 2000. The intro to &quot;Trouble in 421&quot; was briefly played at a July 2011 show in Los Angeles, which was recorded as part of their &quot;Incubus HQ Live&quot; release. While Incubus still regularly performs certain songs from &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, Boyd asserted in 2012 that the band has no intention of performing tracks from &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; again. He remarked, &quot;what&#x27;s funny is people are still asking for a lot of those songs. We&#x27;re very happy that they exist, but we just as soon let them exist in recordings. I don&#x27;t even know if we&#x27;d know how to play them.&quot;

<doc id="385398" wikidata="Q566397" url="?curid=385398" title="Weimar Triangle">
<text>The Weimar Triangle (French: &quot;Triangle de Weimar&quot;; German: &quot;Weimarer Dreieck&quot;; Polish: &quot;Trójkąt Weimarski&quot;) is a regional alliance of France, Germany, and Poland created in 1991 in the German city of Weimar. The group is intended to promote co-operation between the three countries in cross-border and European issues.

It exists mostly in the form of summit meetings between the leaders of the three countries, and of their foreign ministers. The collaboration between member states includes inter-parliamentary contacts and military, scientific, and cultural cooperation.

== History ==
===1990s===
The Weimar Triangle was established in the German city of Weimar in 1991, aimed at assisting Poland&#x27;s emergence from Communist rule. Attending the meeting were the Foreign Ministers of each state: Roland Dumas of France, Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany, and Krzysztof Skubiszewski of Poland. Genscher chose Weimar for the inaugural meeting because it was situated in former East Germany.

At the 1992 meeting of the Weimar Triangle in France, Poland won agreement from Germany and France that it should have special association status at the Western European Union, the European arm of NATO.

===2000s===
Apart from regular meetings of ministers of foreign affairs and occasional summits of the countries&#x27; leaders, no major changes or decisions were made in the first decade of the twenty-first century in the Weimar Triangle.

===2010s===
At the 2011 summit hosted by President Bronisław Komorowski of Poland and attended by President Nicolas Sarkozy (France) and Chancellor Angela Merkel (Germany), the three leaders discussed issues of renewing regular Weimar Triangle meetings and improving relations with Russia (among other topics). Both Germany and France urged Poland to join the Pact for Competitiveness.

On 5 July 2011, France, Germany, and Poland signed an agreement in Brussels to put together a unit of 1,700 soldiers under Polish command, called the Weimar Battlegroup, that was to be ready to deploy in crisis zones starting in 2013. The operational command centre was to be based in Mont Valerien, located in a Paris suburb.
Shortly after the referendum on the status of Crimea held on 16 March 2014, the chairpersons of the Weimar Triangle parliament&#x27;s committees on foreign affairs – Elisabeth Guigou of France, Norbert Röttgen of Germany and Grzegorz Schetyna of Poland – visited Kyiv to express their countries’ firm support of the territorial integrity and the European integration of Ukraine. This was the first time that parliamentarians of the Weimar Triangle had ever made a joint trip to a third country.

In April 2016, Poland&#x27;s foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski told daily newspaper &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot; that the Weimar Triangle had lost its relevance for his country.

On 28 August 2016, representatives of the three countries vowed to &quot;reinvigorate&quot; the Weimar Triangle. German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the group would meet before the end of 2016, and French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said France would host a summit in November 2016. The stated reasoning for this reinvigoration were the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, as well as the ongoing European migrant crisis.

===2020s===
On 8 February 2022, the meeting between Presidents Emmanuel Macron, Andrzej Duda and Chancellor Olaf Scholz took place in Berlin to discuss security cooperation in the face of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis. This was the first such trilateral meeting between the three heads of state or government in many years, and was seen as a step towards strengthening the Weimar Triangle format. At a joint press conference President Duda appealed for unity among European leaders saying that &quot;We must show that we speak in one voice&quot;. The German Chancellor stressed that any violation of Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and would have &quot;far-reaching consequences for Russia in political, economic and geo-strategic dimensions&quot; while President Macron reinforced France&#x27;s determination to use diplomatic efforts which he said were &quot;the only path to end the conflict around Ukraine.&quot; On 24 February the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began.

On 12 June 2023, the leaders of the Weimar Triangle, Scholz, Macron and Duda met at the group&#x27;s summit held in Paris to discuss a number of foreign policy issues the most important of which was the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The leaders reaffirmed their &quot;unwavering support&quot; for Ukraine and declared to assist the country in its defence efforts against Russia’s aggression politically, with humanitarian aid, financially and also by supplying arms. Among the topics discussed was also Ukraine’s future membership in the European Union and the NATO alliance.

On 27 June 2023, the German Minister of Finance Christian Lindner remarked in Berlin that today was the first meeting in that format of financiers since 2017. The invasion of Ukraine was the reason for the revived interest in this format. Lindner, Bruno Le Maire and Magdalena Rzeczkowska discussed the union of their capital markets.

As the Fall of Avdiivka culminated, at the meeting of Weimar Triangle heads in Berlin on 12 February 2024 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk hinted that his country might join the European Sky Shield Initiative project headed by Germany, notable especially in the wake of unsettling comments on the future of NATO by an American presidential candidate. The foreign ministers, who also met that day in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, called amongst other things for a &quot;Weimar of citizens&quot;, a &quot;Weimar of youth&quot;, a &quot;Weimar of excellence&quot; and a &quot;Weimar of culture&quot;.

On 15 March 2024, a summit of Weimar Triangle was held in Berlin with Macron, Scholz and Tusk in attendance. The leaders stressed that they remained united over their stance on Europe&#x27;s response to Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine. The leaders also announced a &quot;capacity coalition&quot; to provide long-distance artillery to Ukraine would be established, while declaring to &quot;never prompt escalation&quot; there. Chancellor Scholz stated that the three countries wanted to make sure that Ukraine could be capable of defending itself against Russia&#x27;s invasion. Other journalists were keen to quote Scholz as having said at the &quot;hastily arranged summit&quot; that a &quot;coalition for long-range rocket artillery&quot; was then formed and that &quot;starting immediately, we will procure even more weapons for Ukraine, on the overall world market.&quot; Another journalist was surprised that the leaders did not take questions from the press.

On 7 November 2024, the leaders of the Weimar Triangle issued a joint statement expressing concern over the 2024 Georgian parliamentary election calling for &quot;swift and transparent investigations of all complaints and reports of election-related irregularities&quot; and the reversal of the Russian-inspired legislation. On 31 December 2024, the Weimar Triangle foreign ministers made another statement about the overall political crisis, adding their concern about &quot;violence against peaceful protesters, media and opposition leaders&quot; and &quot;[t]he political course of repression and democratic backsliding by the Georgian Dream&quot; and stating that they were &quot;determin[ed] to support the democratic and European aspirations of the Georgian people&quot;.

<text>Toll Collect GmbH is a German company that has developed and is running the tolling system for trucks (LKW-Maut) on German motorways.

The company was a consortium led by Daimler AG, Deutsche Telekom, and Cofiroute until 2018 when it was taken over by German Government. The consortium won a bid for the development of a toll billing system from the German government. The development of the system started in September 2002. The technology is based on the Global Positioning System, and a web application for booking truck routes in advance. Trucks are equipped with embedded systems called &quot;On Board Units&quot; (OBUs). OBUs are used for positioning, monitoring and billing. Additionally, the OBUs have infrared and Dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) interfaces for exchanging data with stationary enforcement gantries and mobile enforcement on the tolled road network.

Since the end of 2002 several hundred engineers and programmers worked on the project. Articles report more than 1000 experts were involved in the project. The rollout was first scheduled for the end of August 2003, but was delayed repeatedly, causing the government to forfeit toll collection on trucks using the Autobahn. The deadline was first shifted by 2 months, then by at least one year. Not until the German government purchased Toll Collect were the long-lasting disputes between Toll Collect and the German government about the payment of damages due to the long delay in the launching system resolved. There were also accusations that during the tendering procedure for the system, the offers made by non-German companies were not given fair consideration.

The system was opened two years behind schedule on January 1, 2005. It was the first system in the world that deployed a national GNSS road pricing scheme. The charge per kilometre varies according to the number of axles and the vehicle&#x27;s emission category, and is between 9 and 14 cents per kilometre. For a trip from Hamburg to Munich (776 km) for example, the costs lie between €69.84 and €108.64. Since the installation of an On Board Unit (OBU) by a professional service is costly and/or time-consuming, the option of paying for a specific trip tickets was also provided from the very beginning (as illustrated).

In publications from December 2019, however, journalists attributed Toll Collect&#x27;s whereabouts to the federal government to the contracts signed by Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer with industry representatives on the failed car toll in December 2018 and also critically assessed the role of the State Secretary and later Toll Collect boss Gerhard Schulz . According to this, the provision of parts of the Toll Collect infrastructure was probably already assured to Scheuer&#x27;s contractual partners at the time before the bidding process for the Toll Collect privatization was officially ended in January 2019.

==Technical background of the satellite based toll system==

Generally, for any truck travelling on the German motorways, the distance-based fees can be paid by different means: through the advanced purchase of a specific route via the internet or at payment terminals (typically located in fuel stations), or fully automated through the use of OBUs that are professionally installed in the trucks. Through the use of satellite navigation, the position and the trip are data stored in the OBU which enable the device to determine the tolling fees that apply for the route driven. The data collected in the OBU are transferred to the data center by mobile data communication (GSM), and processed for billing. The fact that the system is &quot;satellite based&quot; relates to the positioning only, not to the communication of the OBU to the data center.

 To prevent avoidance of toll payments (e.g. by switching off the OBUs), the trucks are photographed at approximately 300 toll enforcement gantries, and checked by approximately 450 mobile checking stations. The data generated from these compliance checks are compared in the central computing system, and enforcement measured being started. The non-compliance rate is published as being constantly less than 1%.

Plans to export the specific German solution to other countries were not realized, but a number of GNSS-based tolling solutions were implemented in European countries for distance-based charging of trucks. Plans to expand the system to value-added services, such as fleet management, were not implemented.

<text>Fimafeng is one of the servants of Ægir in Norse mythology. In the &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, Fimafeng is killed out of jealousy by Loki at a party held by his master, after hearing him being lauded by the people for the banquet he had prepared to the Æsir (gods).

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Fimafeng&quot; has been translated as &#x27;hurrying service&#x27;.

== Attestation ==
In the beginning of &quot;Lokasenna&quot; (Loki&#x27;s Flyting), Aegir&#x27;s servants Fimafeng and Eldir are praised by the people for their good job at welcoming guests to a feast prepared to the Æsir (gods) and hosted by their master. The áss (god) Loki, jealous of the praise being heaped upon them, suddenly kills Fimafeng, causing the Aesir to expel him from the party. Loki eventually returns to the feast and offers an elaborate series of insults (flyting) to the Aesir gods and to the other servant, Eldir.

<text>Flyting or fliting (Classical Gaelic: &quot;immarbág&quot;, , &quot;counter-boasting&quot;), is a contest consisting of the exchange of insults between two parties, often conducted in verse.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;flyting&quot; comes from the Old English verb meaning &#x27;to quarrel&#x27;, made into a gerund with the suffix -&quot;ing&quot;. Attested from around 1200 in the general sense of a verbal quarrel, it is first found as a technical literary term in Scotland in the sixteenth century. The first written Scots example is William Dunbar, &quot;The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedie&quot;, written in the late fifteenth century.

== Description ==

Flyting is a ritual, poetic exchange of insults practiced mainly between the 5th and 16th centuries. Examples of flyting are found throughout Scots, Ancient, Medieval and Modern Celtic, Old English, Middle English and Norse literature involving both historical and mythological figures. The exchanges would become extremely provocative, often involving accusations of cowardice or sexual perversion.

Norse literature contains stories of the gods flyting. For example, in &quot;Lokasenna&quot; the god Loki insults the other gods in the hall of Ægir. In the poem &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;, Hárbarðr (generally considered to be Odin in disguise) engages in flyting with Thor.

In the confrontation of Beowulf and Unferð in the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, flytings were used as either a prelude to battle or as a form of combat in their own right.

In Anglo-Saxon England, flyting would take place in a feasting hall. The winner would be decided by the reactions of those watching the exchange. The winner would drink a large cup of beer or mead in victory, then invite the loser to drink as well.

The 13th-century poem &quot;The Owl and the Nightingale&quot; and Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Parlement of Foules&quot; contain elements of flyting.

Flyting became public entertainment in Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries, when makars would engage in verbal contests of provocative, often sexual and scatological but highly poetic abuse. Flyting was permitted despite the fact that the penalty for profanities in public was a fine of 20 shillings (over £300 in 2025 prices) for a lord, or a whipping for a servant. James IV and James V encouraged &quot;court flyting&quot; between poets for their entertainment and occasionally engaged with them. &quot;The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie&quot; records a contest between William Dunbar and Walter Kennedy in front of James IV, which includes the earliest recorded use of the word shit as a personal insult. In 1536 the poet Sir David Lyndsay composed a ribald 60-line flyte to James V after the King demanded a response to a flyte.

Flytings appear in several of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Margaret Galway analysed 13 comic flytings and several other ritual exchanges in the tragedies. Flytings also appear in Nicholas Udall&#x27;s &quot;Ralph Roister Doister&quot; and John Still&#x27;s &quot;Gammer Gurton&#x27;s Needle&quot; from the same era.

While flyting died out in Scottish writing after the Middle Ages, it continued for writers of Celtic background. Robert Burns parodied flyting in his poem, &quot;To a Louse&quot;, and James Joyce&#x27;s poem &quot;The Holy Office&quot; is a curse upon society by a bard. Joyce played with the traditional two-character exchange by making one of the characters representing society as a whole.

== Similar practices ==
Hilary Mackie has detected in the &quot;Iliad&quot; a consistent differentiation between representations in Greek of Achaean and Trojan speech, where Achaeans repeatedly engage in public, ritualized abuse: &quot;Achaeans are proficient at blame, while Trojans perform praise poetry.&quot;

Taunting songs are present in the Inuit culture, among many others. Flyting can also be found in Arabic poetry in a popular form called &quot;naqā’iḍ&quot;, as well as the competitive verses of Japanese Haikai.

Echoes of the genre continue into modern poetry. Hugh MacDiarmid&#x27;s poem &quot;A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle&quot;, for example, has many passages of flyting in which the poet&#x27;s opponent is, in effect, the rest of humanity.

Flyting is similar in both form and function to the modern practice of freestyle battles between rappers and the historic practice of the Dozens, a verbal-combat game representing a synthesis of flyting and its Early Modern English descendants with comparable African verbal-combat games such as &quot;Ikocha Nkocha&quot;.

In the Finnish epic &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the hero Väinämöinen uses the similar practice of &quot;kilpalaulanta&quot; (duel singing) to defeat his opponent Joukahainen.

<doc id="385407" wikidata="Q238759" url="?curid=385407" title="Flag of Macau">
<text>The Regional Flag of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is light green with a lotus flower above the stylised Governador Nobre de Carvalho Bridge and water in white, beneath a circular arc of five golden five-pointed stars: one large star in the center of the arc with two smaller stars on each side of the large star, each with a point angled directly outward from the center of the common circle on which they lie.

The lotus was chosen as the floral emblem of Macau. The Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge is a bridge linking the Macau Peninsula and the island of Taipa. The bridge is one of the most recognisable landmarks for the territory. The water beneath the lotus and the bridge symbolise Macau&#x27;s position as a port and its role played in the territory. The five five-pointed stars echo the design of the flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, symbolising the relationship Macau has with its sovereign state.
According to the Basic Law of Macau, the Macau Regional Flag is a green flag with five stars, lotus flower, bridge and sea water. This law also adopted &quot;Apart from displaying the Flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Macao Special Administrative Region may also use a regional flag&quot;.

== 1993 proposals ==

In 1993, several proposed designs were put forward.
* Similar to the current flag of Macau, but the lotus is stylised differently and is found in a disc, with the stars inside the flower;
* A tricolour of red-white-red; the middle band has a depiction of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in Macau;
* A triband with a stylised &quot;M&quot; standing for Macau; a large star above four smaller stars representative of China;
* A vertical bicolour of green and red, resembling the Flag of Portugal, with a stylised lotus flower in the lower fly;
* A symbol with a red, a blue, and a green circle arranged in a pyramid with a yellow star inside the red circle over a horizontal bicolour of white and yellow;
* A red and blue stylised &quot;M&quot; with a large five-pointed star, with a red lotus blossom within the centre of the star, on the upper fly of a white flag with two blue horizontal bands;
* Similar to the current flag of Macau, but the flag colour is red, and the emblem excludes the bridge and water underneath the lotus on the current flag;
* A stylised lotus flower with an arch of yellow stars on a red flag;
* A stylised lotus flower with an arch of yellow stars above the flower on a red flag;
* A depiction of the Guia Fortress Lighthouse, the oldest in Asia, under a golden star; a white halo ring forms around the lighthouse, and two light cones divide the upper fly (red in colour) and lower fly (blue in colour);
* A vertical bicolour of green and red, resembling the Flag of Portugal, with a white gull in the upper fly and a white depiction of the Gov. Nobre de Carvalho Bridge in the lower fly;
* A stylised lotus flower on a red flag with an arch of yellow stars above the flower;
* A red triangle with base on hoist and apex on the fly edge, filled with the stars from the flag of China;
* A stylised lotus flower, with a red-outlined star within the top petal;
* Another depiction of the Gov. Nobre de Carvalho Bridge in the lower fly on a red flag, with the five yellow stars running parallel to the outline of the bridge;

== Color scheme ==

==Portuguese rule==
Prior to the handover to China in 1999, Macau officially used only the Portuguese flag, in contrast to British Hong Kong which used a defaced Blue Ensign as its flag, alongside the Union Jack. In 1967, there were proposals to give each overseas province its own flag, consisting of the Portuguese flag with the local coat of arms, but none was ever adopted.

The Government of Macau adopted a flag with the colony&#x27;s coat of arms on a light blue field. Meanwhile, the Municipal Council of Macau had a flag with a Portuguese-style coat of arms and two angels as heraldic supporters, which was used at the 1999 handover ceremony as well as the 1990, 1994 and 1998 Asian Games.

<text>World of Noise is the debut album recorded by American rock band Everclear. It was recorded in a friend&#x27;s basement for $400 with Art Alexakis on vocals/lead guitar, Craig Montoya on bass, Scott Cuthbert on drums and was released in 1993 by Tim Kerr Records.

==Album information==
Alexakis used a beat-up Guild Bluesbird guitar to perform the album. For an amp, Alexakis used a Fender Super Twin with a blown 6L6 tube that would squeal every time Art hit a chord. Often, the amp would overheat and start smoking. When that happened, they would put icepacks on the back and let it cool down, then get back to recording the demo. Despite the problems, Alexakis&#x27; amp ended up giving the album a uniquely raucous, noisy sound.

The album was originally never meant to be released, but rather a demo. After finishing the initial sessions, the band compiled a cassette and sold it at shows. Once more material was complete, the band swapped out a couple of songs and issued the album on Tim/Kerr. The original self-released cassette included &quot;Drunk Again&quot;, which later appeared on the &quot;Nervous &amp; Weird&quot; EP and lacked &quot;Nervous &amp; Weird&quot;.

When the band signed with Capitol Records in 1994, the label agreed to re-release the album, and remastered it to try to improve the sound. Capitol released their version of the album on November 1, 1994. In the early 2000s, rights to the album reverted to Alexakis, who planned to remix the album and reissue it on his own label, Popularity Recordings. However, problems at his label (and its subsequent closure) shelved the project.

The song &quot;Loser Makes Good&quot; was written about an insane homeless man that shot and killed Art&#x27;s friend, Phillip Bury, better known by his stage name &quot;Buck Naked&quot; of &quot;Buck Naked and the Barebottom Boys&quot;, who released their only album on Alexakis&#x27;s label, Shindig Records.

<text>The Dar Pomorza () is a Polish full-rigged sailing ship built in 1909 which is preserved in Gdynia as a museum ship. She has served as a sail training ship in Germany, France, and Poland. &quot;Dar Pomorza&quot; won the Cutty Sark Trophy in 1980.

== History ==

The ship was built in 1909 by Blohm &amp; Voss and dedicated in 1910 by &quot;Deutscher Schulschiff-Verein&quot; as the German training ship &quot;Prinzess Eitel Friedrich&quot;, named for Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Oldenburg, wife of Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia. Her yard no. was 202, her hull was launched on 12 October 1909. In 1920, following World War I, the ship was taken as war-reparations by Great Britain, then brought to France, where she was assigned to the seamen&#x27;s school at St-Nazaire under the name &quot;Colbert&quot;. The ship was in 1927 given to Baron de Forrest as compensation for the loss of a sailing yacht. Due to the high costs of refurbishing the ship, she was sold in 1929.

Still bearing the name &quot;Prinzess Eitel Friedrich&quot;, she was bought by the Polish community of Pomerania for £7,000, as the new training ship for the Maritime School in Gdynia. She was given the name &quot;Dar Pomorza&quot; (the Gift of Pomerania). In 1930 the ship was repaired and fitted with an auxiliary diesel engine. The experience gained during rebuilding works enabled Danish shipbuilders of Nakskov to build a sail training vessel for their country, the &quot;Danmark&quot; (still in service).

The ship made her first voyage under Polish colours named (temporarily) &quot;Pomorze&quot; (Pomerania in Polish). (Possibly the name was later changed in an effort to not name the ship similar to a very unfortunate one, the German pre-dreadnought battleship &quot;Pommern&quot; (Pomerania in German), which was lost with all hands during the Battle of Jutland in June 1916.) This first voyage was made under tow of two Dutch tugs (&quot;Poolzee&quot; and &quot;Witte Zee&quot;) with a party of Polish and Dutch runners aboard, starting on 26 Dec. 1929 from St. Nazaire, and ending on 9 Jan. 1930 at Nakskov, the ship narrowly escaping destruction in a gale off the Brittany coast. The voyage later became famous through some accounts, including one written by Mr T. Meissner, the ship&#x27;s first mate.

During the following years, rebuilt and converted into training unit fitted i/a with an auxiliary Diesel engine, she was used as a training ship, receiving the nickname &quot;White Frigate&quot;. In 1934-1935 she travelled around the world (via Panama Canal). During that famous voyage, she called at many ports as the first ship ever under Polish flag. In 1937 a special voyage took her around the famous Cape Horn; thus she became the first ship under Polish Colours to round the famous cape. In 1938 she took part at the famous meeting of Baltic sail training ships at Stockholm, regarded as the predecessor of all the post-war Operation Sail meetings, winning i. a. special respect the skipper of Norwegian sail training vessel &quot;Christian Radich&quot;. During World War II she was interned in Stockholm. After the war, she was brought to Communist Poland and used as a training ship again.

In 1967 she made a &#x27;second debut&#x27;, calling at Montreal, Quebec, Canada, during the Expo-Fair and winning general respect for her and her country. In the 1970s she took part in several Operation Sail and Cutty Sark Tall Ships&#x27; Races, winning her first race in 1972, taking the 3rd place in 1973, the 4th in 1974 and winning the 1st place and Cutty Sark Trophy in 1980. In 1976, during the famous Operation Sail &#x27;76 in the US, her retiring skipper Kazimierz Jurkiewicz was officially greeted by Mr Kjell Thorsen, the skipper of the Norwegian &quot;Christian Radich&quot;. The &quot;Dar Pomorza&quot; has been one of several Blohm &amp; Voss-built tall ships, most popular in the world. Her importance to the world&#x27;s maritime heritage is her origin - she is the younger sister of the (still existing) &quot;Grossherzogin Elisabeth&quot;, the world&#x27;s first purpose-built sail training ship. As well, she is the first ship ever to carry the Polish Colours around the world in one voyage (1934–35), thus becoming incomparable to any other existing unit of her sort.

On 15 September 1981 she undertook her last voyage to the Finnish harbour of Kotka, finishing it 13 days later. On 4 August 1982 she was decommissioned and festively replaced by the &quot;Dar Młodzieży&quot; as a training ship.

=== Museum ship ===

Since 27 May 1983 she has been a museum ship in Gdynia (next to the &quot;Błyskawica&quot;). She is part of a collection of National Maritime Museum in Gdańsk. In October 2009 the &quot;Dar Pomorza&quot; celebrated her 100th &quot;birthday&quot;. The celebration included her second christening by Mrs Barbara Szczurek, the wife of the Mayor of Gdynia.

Her speed under sail averaged 5 knots, with a 17 knots maximum. Her auxiliary engine was one of the type used in German U-boats, and her horn, installed after the war, was from the German battleship &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, scuttled on 27/28 March 1945 at one of the entrances to the harbour of Gdynia.

==Sister ships==
The three sister ships of &quot;Dar Pomorza&quot; also survive:
*&quot;Duchesse Anne&quot; (originally &quot;Großherzogin Elisabeth&quot;)
*&quot;Schulschiff Deutschland&quot;
*&quot;Statsraad Lehmkuhl&quot; (originally &quot;Großherzog Friedrich August&quot;)

<text>The Church of Christ, Instrumental, also known as Kelleyites, are a baptistic body of Christians based in central Arkansas.

==Names==
In the only book written about this group they are called the &quot;Church of Christ, Instrumental&quot; or &quot;Kelleyites&quot;. Elder E. J. Lambert, a Primitive Baptist minister who was raised among this body, and whose father was a minister of the &quot;Church of Christ, Instrumental&quot;, in his autobiography consistently refers to them as the &quot;Church of Christ (Kelly Division of Missionary Baptists)&quot;. They are referred to as &quot;Kelleyites&quot; in official documents of the Works Progress Administration in the 1940s.

==History==
The Kelleyites owe their name and origin to Samuel Kelley. Kelley was born in 1817 in what is now Pike County, Arkansas, but in early adulthood he moved to Illinois. In Illinois, he first connected himself to the Methodists, but later joined the Baptists and was ordained by them in 1838. Shortly after this he returned to Arkansas. A difference in practice between the Baptists with whom he was connected in Illinois and the Baptists in Arkansas was evidently a contributing factor to the rise of the Kelley division of the missionary Baptist church. Among other things, the Baptists in Illinois received Samuel Kelley on his Methodist baptism, which was foreign to the practice of Arkansas Baptists.

Kelley was a prominent and successful citizen by the standards of his day. He lived in Pike County and later in Howard County. He was elected to at least one term in the State Legislature. His church was a member of the Red River Baptist Association. In 1856, Kelley was invited to preach at the meeting of the Caddo River Baptist Association. In this sermon, he preached the doctrine of apostasy, or falling from grace. The next morning the Caddo River Association passed resolutions against Elder Kelley, his doctrine of apostasy, the fact he had not been baptized by a Baptist, and also withdrew fellowship from the Red River Association. The next year the Red River Association excluded Samuel Kelley and his followers. Kelley evidently preached between 1857 and 1870 wherever he could. In 1870, Kelley convinced the Philippi Baptist Church to adopt open communion and change their name to the Philippi Church of Christ. The only change to &quot;Church of Christ&quot; would simply mean dropping the Baptist name from the common practice of that day (i.e., Philippi Baptist Church of Christ becomes Philippi Church of Christ). This church withdrew from the Caddo River Association that year, and the Caddo River Association also withdrew from them. This can be considered the official date of the division of the Kelleyites from the Baptists (although persons such as Elder Lambert still considered them to be Missionary Baptists). Other churches were organized and existing churches adopted the doctrine and practice of the Kelleyites, and this movement grew for a time. Later the movement would decline, and now (2003) survives with 5 churches - 4 in Hot Spring County, Arkansas and 1 in Clark County, Arkansas. Membership is estimated at 400 in the 5 congregations. Perhaps the ecumenical nature of the church&#x27;s doctrine, rather than lack of evangelization, has led to the decline in churches and membership.

==Doctrine and practice==
After their separation from the Caddo River and Red River Associations, the Kelleyites formed &quot;The Council of the Church of Christ&quot;. This council is fashioned on the order of a Baptist association and meets annually. Rules are similar and they preserve the autonomy of the local church. The council has no authority to act on local church matters, nor even to advise unless the church asks them to do so.

The major differences doctrinally between the Kelleyites and the missionary Baptists of Arkansas at the time of division was that the Kelleyites held final apostasy (or falling from grace), open communion, and alien baptism. The Kelleyite theology is somewhat of a mixture of old time Methodist and Baptist doctrine. They are similar in doctrine and practice to the Free Will Baptists, but have evidently never had any connection with them. In addition to baptism and the Lord&#x27;s supper, they also hold feet washing as an ordinance. This is an issue that would separate them from most present-day missionary Baptists in Arkansas, but would have been of little consequence in the mid-19th century. The church has three offices: pastor, elder, and deacon. The &quot;Kelleyites&quot; preserve their links to the Baptists by using the Sunday School literature of the American Baptist Association.

The church doctrine is ecumenical in nature, but article 14 (adopted in 1952) of their constitution states, &quot;No minister, except regular ordained ministers of the Church of Christ, shall be permitted to preach or conduct services in any individual church without special permission from the pastor and members of that particular church. (Exceptions being made for funerals.)&quot; This article reveals an interest in self-preservation - though they desire fellowship with other Christians, they also seek to preserve what they feel in their unique heritage.

The churches often label their church signs as &quot;Church of Christ, Instrumental&quot; to differentiate them from the Churches of Christ (non-instrumental) movement of Alexander Campbell and others.

<doc id="385415" wikidata="Q3519336" url="?curid=385415" title="Texas Bowl">
<text>The Texas Bowl is an annual postseason NCAA-sanctioned Division I FBS college football bowl game first held in 2006 in Houston, Texas. Each edition of the bowl has been played at NRG Stadium, previously known as Reliant Stadium. The bowl replaced the defunct Houston Bowl, which was played annually from 2000 to 2005, and before that the Bluebonnet Bowl, the first bowl game in Houston, played from 1959 through 1987.

==History==
===Replacing the Houston Bowl===
Speculation surfaced questioning the long-term survival of the former Houston Bowl. The three-year contract with EV1.net expired on December 31, 2005, leaving the bowl game without a title sponsor. A college football official told the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; that the bowl was in danger of ceasing operations, as a result of the game losing its title sponsor and because the Houston Bowl still owed roughly $600,000 to the Big 12 and Mountain West conferences following the 2005 game. However, the NCAA approved Lone Star Sports &amp; Entertainment, a division of the Houston Texans, who also play in Reliant Stadium, to take over game management. In July 2006, the NFL Network acquired TV rights and naming rights to the bowl.

===Texas Bowl introduction===
The Texas Bowl name and logo were officially unveiled on August 10, 2006, at a press conference along with conference affiliations for the bowl spots. The Big 12, Big East and Conference USA will be affiliated with the game, as well as Texas Christian University of the Mountain West. The 2006 matchup featured teams from the Big 12 and Big East Conferences.

On December 3, 2006, Rutgers accepted an invitation to play Kansas State in the inaugural Texas Bowl. &quot;We&#x27;re ecstatic about having Rutgers,&quot; Texas Bowl director David Brady said. &quot;This is a top-15 team that was three yards away from a BCS game. We couldn&#x27;t be happier to have them here.&quot;

2010 marked the eleventh consecutive year a bowl game has played in Houston, and the 40th year overall with a bowl game there (the Bluebonnet Bowl lasted 29 years). It was also announced on December 30, 2009, that ESPN Events would take over as part owner and operator of the game, while Lone Star Sports and Entertainment will maintain a stake in the bowl, and would be carried on ESPN.

===Sponsors===
On April 12, 2011, ESPN announced Meineke Car Care signed a three-year title sponsorship deal beginning in 2011, changing name of the bowl to the Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas. On February 12, 2014, it was announced that AdvoCare will be the title sponsor for the bowl game. That sponsorship concluded after the 2016 game. On November 15, 2017, Academy Sports + Outdoors became the new title sponsor of the bowl. That sponsorship concluded after the 2019 game.

On December 14, 2020, Mercari was announced as the new title sponsor of the game. The 2020 game was later canceled due to COVID-19 issues. On November 24, 2021, TaxAct was named as the new title sponsor of both the Texas Bowl and the Camellia Bowl. This arrangement remained in place through the 2023 edition. On December 4, 2024, Kinder&#x27;s Flavors was named as the new title sponsor.

===Conference tie-ins===
On May 17, 2007, it was announced Conference USA would have a team in the 2007 Texas Bowl. The Texas Bowl has a rotating commitment with the Big East Conference and Conference USA for 2006–09 while the Big 12 Conference will have a team in all four of those games. In 2007, TCU took the place of the Big 12 team when Kansas and Oklahoma were put into the BCS, and Houston, a &quot;home team,&quot; represented C-USA. The conferences would receive $612,500 each as per the rules of the agreements as usually, the Big East (or Big 12) would have received $750,000 for playing and C-USA would have received a $500,000 stipend for their team playing.

===Issues===
According to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, in 2008 the bowl required Western Michigan University to purchase 11,000 tickets at full price in order to accept the invitation to play in the bowl. The university was only able to sell 548 tickets at that price, forcing it to accept a $462,535 loss, before travel expenses, to pay for the privilege of playing in the bowl.

The 2020 edition, slated for December 31 between TCU and Arkansas, was cancelled on December 29 due to COVID-19 issues within the TCU program.

<text>Momordica charantia (commonly called bitter melon, cerassee, goya, bitter apple, bitter gourd, bitter squash, balsam-pear, karavila and many more names listed below) is a tropical and subtropical vine of the family Cucurbitaceae, widely grown in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean for its edible fruit. Its many varieties differ substantially in the shape and bitterness of the fruit.

Bitter melon originated in Africa, where it was a dry-season staple food of ǃKung hunter-gatherers. Wild or semi-domesticated variants spread across Asia in prehistory, and it was likely fully domesticated in Southeast Asia. It is widely used in the cuisines of East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

== Description ==

This herbaceous, tendril-bearing vine grows up to in length. It bears simple, alternate leaves across, with three to seven deeply separated lobes. Each plant bears separate yellow male and female flowers. In the Northern Hemisphere, flowering occurs from June to July, and fruiting from September to November. It is a frost-tender annual in the temperate zone and a perennial in the tropics. It grows best in the USDA zones 9 to 11.

The fruit has a distinctive warty exterior and an oblong shape. It is hollow in cross-section, with a relatively thin layer of flesh surrounding a central seed cavity filled with large, flat seeds and pith. The fruit is most often eaten green, or as it is beginning to turn yellow. At this stage, the fruit&#x27;s flesh is crunchy and watery in texture, similar to cucumber, chayote, or green bell pepper, but bitter. The skin is tender and edible. Seeds and pith appear white in unripe fruits; they are not intensely bitter and can be removed before cooking.

Some sources claim the flesh (rind) becomes somewhat tougher and more bitter with age, but other sources claim that at least for the common Chinese variety the skin does not change and bitterness decreases with age. The Chinese variety is best harvested light green possibly with a slight yellow tinge or just before. The pith becomes sweet and intensely red; it can be eaten uncooked in this state and is a popular ingredient in some Southeast Asian salads.

When the fruit is fully ripe, it turns orange and soft and splits into segments that curl back to expose seeds covered in bright red pulp.

=== Varieties ===
Bitter melons come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The common Chinese variety is 20–30 cm (7.9–11.8 in) long, oblong with blunt ends, pale green in color, and has a slightly undulating warty surface. The common Indian bitter melon is narrower in shape, pointed at both ends, and covered with jagged, triangular &quot;teeth&quot; and ridges. It ranges from green to white in color. There are many intermediate shapes between these two extremes. Some bitter melons produce miniature fruits that are only 6–10 cm (2.4–3.9 in) long and are eaten alone as a stuffed vegetable. These miniature fruits are popular in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and other countries in South Asia. The subcontinental variety is most popular in Bangladesh and India.

=== Pests ===
&quot;M. charantia&quot; is one of the main hosts of &quot;Bactrocera tau&quot;, a fly known to prefer Cucurbitaceae.

== Uses ==

=== Cooking ===

Bitter melon is generally consumed cooked in the green or early yellowing stage. The young shoots and leaves of the bitter melon may also be eaten as greens. The fruit is bitter raw and can be soaked in cold water and drained to remove some of those strong flavours.

==== China ====
In Chinese cuisine, bitter melon (, ) is used in stir-fries (often with pork and &quot;douchi&quot;), soups, dim sum, and herbal teas (gohyah tea). It has also been used in place of hops as the bittering ingredient in some beers in China and Okinawa.

==== India ====
Bitter gourd is commonly eaten throughout India. In North Indian cuisine, it is often served with yogurt on the side to offset the bitterness, used in curry such as &quot;sabzi,&quot; or stuffed with spices and then cooked in oil.

In South Indian cuisine, it is used in numerous dishes such as &quot;thoran&quot; / &quot;thuvaran&quot; (mixed with grated coconut), &quot;pavaikka mezhukkupuratti&quot; (stir-fried with spices), &quot;theeyal&quot; (cooked with roasted coconut), and &quot;pachadi&quot; (which is considered a medicinal food for diabetics), making it vital in Malayali&#x27;s diet. Other popular recipes include preparations with curry, deep-frying with peanuts or other ground nuts, and &quot;Kakara kaya pulusu&quot; () in Telugu, a tamarind-based soup with mini shallots or fried onions and other spices, thickened with chickpea flour. In Karnataka, bitter melon is known as &quot;hāgalakāyi&quot; () in Kannada; in Tamil Nadu it is known as &quot;paagarkaai&quot; or &quot;pavakai&quot; () in Tamil. In these regions, a special preparation called &quot;pagarkai pitla&quot;, a kind of sour &quot;koottu&quot;, is common. Also commonly seen is &quot;kattu pagarkkai&quot;, a curry in which bitter melons are stuffed with onions, cooked lentils, and grated coconut mix, then tied with thread and fried in oil. In the Konkan region of Maharashtra, salt is added to the finely chopped bitter gourd, known as &quot;karle&quot; () in Marathi, and then it is squeezed, removing its bitter juice to some extent. After frying this with different spices, the less bitter and crispy preparation is served with grated coconut. Bitter melon is known as &quot;karate&quot; () in Goa where it is used widely in Goan cuisine. In Bengal, where it is known as &quot;korola&quot; (করলা) or &quot;ucche&quot; (উচ্ছে) in Bengali, bitter melon is often simply eaten boiled and mashed with salt, mustard oil, sliced thinly and deep fried, added to lentils to make &quot;tetor&quot; dal (bitter lentils), and is a key ingredient of the Shukto, a Bengali vegetable medley that is a mixture of several vegetables like raw banana, drumstick stems, bori, and sweet potato.

In northern India and Nepal, bitter melon, known as &quot;tite karela&quot; () in Nepali, is prepared as a fresh pickle. For this, the vegetable is cut into cubes or slices, and sautéed with oil and a sprinkle of water. When it is softened and reduced, it is crushed in a mortar with a few cloves of garlic, salt, and a red or green pepper. It is also eaten sautéed to golden brown, stuffed, or as a curry on its own or with potatoes.

==== Myanmar ====
In Burmese cuisine, bitter melon is sauteéd with garlic, tomatoes, spices, and dried shrimp and is served as an accompaniment to other dishes. Such a dish is available at street stalls and deli counters throughout the country.

==== Sri Lanka ====
It is called () in Sri Lanka and it is an ingredient in many different curry dishes (e.g., &quot;karawila&quot; curry and &quot;karawila sambol&quot;) which are served mainly with rice in a main meal. Sometimes large grated coconut pieces are added, which is more common in rural areas. &quot;Karawila&quot; juice is also sometimes served there.

==== Japan ====
Bitter melon, known as &quot;gōyā&quot; () in Okinawan, and in Japanese (although the Okinawan word &quot;gōyā&quot; is also used), is a significant ingredient in Okinawan cuisine, and is increasingly used in Japanese cuisine beyond that island.

==== Pakistan ====
In Pakistan, where it is known as &quot;karela&quot; () in Urdu-speaking areas, bitter melon is often cooked with onions, red chili powder, turmeric powder, salt, coriander powder, and a pinch of cumin seeds. Another dish in Pakistan calls for whole, unpeeled bitter melon to be boiled and then stuffed with cooked minced beef, served with either hot &quot;tandoori&quot; bread, &quot;naan&quot;, &quot;chappati&quot;, or with &quot;khichri&quot; (a mixture of lentils and rice).

==== Indonesia ====
In Indonesian cuisine, bitter melon, known as &quot;pare&quot; in Javanese and Indonesian (also &quot;paria&quot;), is prepared in various dishes, such as &quot;gado-gado&quot;, and also stir-fried, cooked in coconut milk, or steamed. In Christian areas in Eastern Indonesia it is cooked with pork and chili, the sweetness of the pork balancing against the bitterness of the vegetable.

==== Vietnam ====
In Vietnamese cuisine, raw bitter melon slices known as &quot;mướp đắng&quot; or &quot;khổ qua&quot; in Vietnamese, eaten with dried meat floss and bitter melon soup with shrimp, are common dishes. Bitter melons stuffed with ground pork are commonly served as a summer soup in the south. It is also used as the main ingredient of stewed bitter melon. This dish is usually cooked for the Tết holiday, where its &quot;bitter&quot; name is taken as a reminder of the bitter living conditions experienced in the past.

==== Thailand ====
In Thai cuisine, the Chinese variety of green bitter melon, &quot;mara&quot; () in Thai, is prepared stuffed with minced pork and garlic, in a clear broth. It is also served sliced and stir-fried with garlic and fish sauce until just tender. Varieties found in Thailand range from large fruit to small fruit. The smallest fruit variety (&quot;mara khii nok&quot;) is generally not cultivated but is occasionally found in the wild and is considered the most nutritious variety.
==== Philippines ====
In the cuisine of the Philippines, bitter melon, known as &quot;Ampalaya&quot; in Filipino and &quot;Paria&quot; in Ilokano, may be stir-fried with ground beef and oyster sauce, or with eggs and diced tomato. The dish &quot;pinakbet&quot;, popular in the Ilocos region of Luzon, consists mainly of bitter melons, eggplant, okra, string beans, tomatoes, lima beans, and other various regional vegetables all stewed together with a little &quot;bagoong&quot;-based stock.

The name of the fruit is rooted in the bitterness of its taste, (Filipino: &quot;Ampait&quot;) which means bitter. In pre-colonial Spanish in Ilocandia, the name is locally translated to &quot;Amparia&quot; and &quot;Ampalaya&quot; in the Filipino language.

==== Trinidad and Tobago ====
In Trinidad and Tobago, bitter melons, known as &quot;caraille&quot; or &quot;carilley&quot;, are usually sautéed with onion, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper until almost crisp.

==== Africa ====
In Mauritius, bitter melons are known as &quot;margose&quot; or &quot;margoze&quot;.

=== Herbal medicine ===
Bitter melon has been used in various Asian and African herbal medicine systems. In the traditional medicine of India, different parts of the plant are used.

==Research==
&quot;Momordica charantia&quot; does not significantly decrease fasting blood glucose levels or A1c, indicators of blood glucose control, when taken in capsule or tablet form. 

=== Adverse effects ===
A possible side effect is gastrointestinal discomfort.

=== Adverse effects in pregnancy ===
Bitter melon is contraindicated in pregnant women because it can induce bleeding, contractions, and miscarriage.

==Bitter melon tea==
Bitter melon tea, also known as &quot;gohyah (goya) tea&quot;, is an herbal tea made from an infusion of dried slices of the bitter melon. It is sold as a medicinal tea, and a culinary vegetable.

Gohyah is not listed in the Grieve&#x27;s herbal database, the MPNA database at University of Michigan (Medicinal Plants of Native America, see Native American ethnobotany), or in the Phytochemical Database of the USDA – Agricultural Research Service (ARS) – National Plant Germplasm System NGRL

==Subspecies==
The plant has one subspecies and four varieties:

*&quot;Momordica charantia var. abbreviata&quot;
*&quot;Momordica charantia var. charantia&quot;
*&quot;Momordica charantia ssp. macroloba&quot;
*&quot;Momordica charantia L. var. muricata&quot;
*&quot;Momordica charantia var. pavel&quot;

&quot;M. charantia var. charantia&quot; and &quot;pavel&quot; are the long-fruited varieties, whereas &quot;M. charantia var. muricata&quot;, &quot;macroloba&quot; and &quot;abbreviata&quot; feature smaller fruits.

<doc id="385417" wikidata="Q307168" url="?curid=385417" title="Abdul Aziz al-Hakim">
<text>Ayatollah Abdul Aziz al-Hakim ( ; ; 1952 – 26 August 2009) was an Iraqi theologian, politician and the leader of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, a party that has approximately 5% support in the Iraqi Council of Representatives. He also served as the President of the Governing Council of Iraq (40th Prime Minister of Iraq)

He was a member of the United States-appointed Iraqi Governing Council and served as its president in December 2003. Brother of the Shia leader Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, he succeeded him as leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq when Mohammed Baqir was assassinated in August 2003 in Najaf.

==Biography==

===Family tree===
Sayyid Abdul Aziz al-Hakim was a member of the Hakim family of Shiite scholars.

===Early life===
He was born in 1952, the son of Grand Ayatollah Muhsin Al-Hakim. He was raised in Najaf and then received his theological education through the religious school there, known as the Hawza. He was married to the daughter of Mohammed Hadi al-Sadr and he was the father of two girls and two boys. His son Muhsin Abdul Aziz al-Hakim was a political adviser to him, and his other son Ammar al-Hakim became the Secretary General of Al-Mihrab Martyr Foundation. Seven of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim&#x27;s brothers were killed, six of them on the orders of Saddam Hussein.

==Iran and SCIRI==
Al-Hakim played a leading role in the &#x27;Safar Intifada&#x27; in Iraq in 1977 and was imprisoned by the Iraqi government in 1972, 1977 and 1979. He went into exile in Iran in 1980, where he was a founding member in 1982 of Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), a group set up under Iran&#x27;s auspices to bring Islamic revolution to Iraq. The group was led by Al-Hakim&#x27;s brother, Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim. SCIRI would later change its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

===Badr Brigades===
Within SCIRI, al-Hakim headed its military wing, the Badr Brigades. Badr was officered by Iranians and its troops fought on Iran&#x27;s side during the Iran–Iraq War.

==Iraq==
With the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in 2003 with the US-led invasion, Al-Hakim and SCIRI returned to Iraq where they have been major players in Iraq&#x27;s politics. SCIRI&#x27;s leader, Mohammed Baqir Al-Hakim, was assassinated on 29 August 2003, when a massive car bomb exploded as he left the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf. Following the murder, Abdul Aziz Al-Hakim became SCIRI&#x27;s head.

Al-Hakim was the top candidate listed for the United Iraqi Coalition during the first Iraqi legislative election of January 2005 but did not seek a government post because the Alliance had decided not to include theologians in the government.

===Interior Ministry===
Under Abdul Aziz Al-Hakim, SCIRI controlled Iraq&#x27;s Interior Ministry. In 2006 according to the United Nations human rights chief in Iraq, John Pace, said that every month hundreds of Iraqis were being tortured to death or executed by the Interior Ministry under SCIRI&#x27;s control. According to a 2006 report by the Independent newspaper: &#x27;Mr Pace said the Ministry of the Interior was &quot;acting as a rogue element within the government&quot;. It is controlled by the main Shia party, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri); the Interior Minister, Bayan Jabr, is a former leader of Sciri&#x27;s Badr Brigade militia, which is one of the main groups accused of carrying out sectarian killings. Another is the Mehdi Army of the young cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who is part of the Shia coalition seeking to form a government after winning the mid-December election.
Many of the 110,000 policemen and police commandos under the ministry&#x27;s control are suspected of being former members of the Badr Brigade. Not only counter-insurgency units such as the Wolf Brigade, the Scorpions and the Tigers, but the commandos and even the highway patrol police have been accused of acting as death squads.

The paramilitary commandos, dressed in garish camouflage uniforms and driving around in pick-up trucks, are dreaded in Sunni neighbourhoods. People whom they have openly arrested have frequently been found dead several days later, with their bodies bearing obvious marks of torture.&#x27;

===U.S. visits===

On 4 December 2006, al-Hakim met with George W. Bush and made a commitment to help end violence,
Al-Hakim also gave his assessment of the situation in Iraq:
On 5 December 2006, on behalf of The Catholic University of America and American University&#x27;s Center for Global Peace, he spoke at the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center. The title of his speech was &quot;Freedom and Tolerance in Shi&#x27;a Islam and the Future of Iraq&quot;. Notable guests at this event included Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., and Rabbi Professor Ephraim Isaac from the Institute of Semitic Studies in Princeton, New Jersey.
==Illness and death==
On 16 May 2007 he flew to Houston for medical treatment. Reportedly he had lung cancer. On 20 May 2007, Hakim left the U.S. for Iran, in order to receive chemotherapy treatment. On 26 August 2009, Abdel Aziz al-Hakim died of lung cancer in a Tehran hospital. He was buried in Najaf on 29 August, on the same day and month as his brother, who was killed exactly six years earlier. Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Lebanese Shia group Hizbollah issued an emotional statement regarding the death of Abdul-Aziz Al-Hakim. The statement spoke of the &quot;struggle&quot; of Al-Hakim to &quot;rescue&quot; and &quot;uplift the Iraqi people.&quot; This drew criticism and calls of sectarianism from political commentator Asad Abukhalil due to the role of Abdul Aziz Al Hakim in the US occupation of Iraq.

<text>Massimo Salvadori, or Max William Salvadori Paleotti (16 June 1908, in London – 6 August 1992) was a British-Italian historian and an anti-Fascist.

Salvadori was educated at the University of Geneva and the University of Rome. He was involved in the anti-Fascist movement in Italy before World War II. Imprisoned from 1931 to 1932 as a result of his political activities, Salvadori fled Italy for Switzerland. In 1943 he joined the British army and after participating in landings at Salerno and Anzio, parachuted into Italy to organize resistance. As agent of the British Special Operations Executive, Salvadori played a central role in providing weapons supplies for partisan formations and in pushing the Action Party to cooperate with the Italian Monarchy after the &quot;svolta di Salerno&quot; (1944). For this service, he was awarded the Military Cross and Distinguished Service Order. He served on the faculty of Smith College from 1945 until his retirement in 1973, with two notable breaks: in 1948-49 he was director of the Division of Political Science of UNESCO in France and in 1952 he worked as a political analyst for the Information Service of the Secretariat of NATO.

<text>The Duke’s Mayo Bowl is an annual college football bowl game that has been played at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, since 2002. Originally commissioned as the Queen City Bowl, it has undergone many name changes due to sponsorship rights. The game currently features a matchup between a team from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and a team from the Southeastern Conference (SEC), the Big Ten Conference or the Big 12 Conference.

==History==
A new college football bowl game in Charlotte, North Carolina, was established in 2002 by Raycom Sports (now a part of Gray Television). The game was certified by the NCAA as the Queen City Bowl, which became the Continental Tire Bowl (2002–2004), Meineke Car Care Bowl (2005–2010), and Belk Bowl (2011–2019) prior to its current name.

The game previously featured a matchup between the No. 5 selected Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) team and the No. 3 selected American Athletic Conference (AAC). Originally, the bowl selected a team from the Big East Conference, until that conference&#x27;s breakup in 2013.

In 2011, Charlotte-based department store chain Belk acquired the title sponsorship for a three-year period through 2013. After the initial period, Belk extended its sponsorship for six years, through 2019. As of 2014, the bowl featured the second pooled selection from the ACC paired against the second pooled selection from the Southeastern Conference (SEC), after selection of the College Football Playoff (CFP) teams.

On November 20, 2019, Belk informed bowl officials that the company would not be renewing its sponsorship after the 2019 season. In June 2020, Duke&#x27;s Mayonnaise was announced as the new title sponsor for the bowl. As part of their sponsorship arrangement, in a take on the Gatorade shower, the head coach of the winning team gets a giant jar of mayonnaise dumped on his head. 

In 2020, the ACC&#x27;s opponent in the bowl is scheduled to begin alternating between the Big Ten Conference and SEC through 2025, with a Big Ten team playing in even-numbered years and an SEC team playing in odd-numbered years. The conference not sending a team to this bowl will send a team to the Las Vegas Bowl.

The 2020 game received notable social media coverage following the game as the quarterback of the winning team, Graham Mertz of Wisconsin, accidentally broke the glass trophy.

<text>The Samnites () were an ancient Italic people who lived in Samnium, which is located in modern inland Abruzzo, Molise, and Campania in south-central Italy.

An Oscan-speaking people, who originated as an offshoot of the Sabines, they formed a confederation consisting of four tribes: the Hirpini, Caudini, Caraceni, and Pentri. Ancient Greek historians considered the Umbri as the ancestors of the Samnites. Their migration was in a southward direction, according to the rite of ver sacrum.

Although allied together against the Gauls in 354 BC, they later became enemies of the Romans and fought them in a series of three wars. Despite an overwhelming victory at the Battle of the Caudine Forks (321 BC), the Samnites were subjugated in 290 BC. Although severely weakened, the Samnites would still side against the Romans, first in the Pyrrhic War and then with Hannibal in the Second Punic War. They also fought in the Social War and later in Sulla&#x27;s civil war as allies of the Roman consuls Papirius Carbo and Gaius Marius against Sulla, who defeated them and their leader Pontius Telesinus at the Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC). Afterward, they were assimilated by the Romans and ceased to exist as a distinct people.

The Samnites had an economy focused upon livestock and agriculture. Samnite agriculture was highly advanced for its time, and they practiced transhumance. Aside from relying on agriculture, the Samnites exported goods such as ceramics, bronze, iron, olives, wool, pottery, and terracottas. Their trade networks extended across Campania, Latium, Apulia, and Magna Graecia.

Samnite society was stratified into cantons. Each city was a &quot;vicus&quot;. Many &quot;vici&quot; were grouped into a &quot;pagus&quot;, and many &quot;pagi&quot; were grouped into a &quot;touto&quot;. There were four Samnite &quot;touto&quot;, one for each of the Samnite tribes. Aside from this system of government, a few Samnite cities had political entities similar to a senate. It was rare, although possible, for the Samnites to unify under a coalition; normally the tribes and cities functioned independently from one another.

Samnite religion worshipped both spirits called &quot;numina&quot; and gods and goddesses. The Samnites honored their gods by sacrificing live animals and using votive offerings. Superstition was prominent in the Samnite religion. It was believed that magical chants could influence reality, that magical amulets could protect people, and that augurs could see the future. Samnite priests would manage religious festivals and they could bind people to oaths. Sanctuaries were a major part of the Samnite religion. These might have been used to benefit from trade networks, may have marked the border between territories, and may have been intertwined with government. Samnite sanctuaries may have also been used to reinforce group identity.

== Etymology ==

The Indo-European root &quot;Saβeno&quot; or &quot;Sabh&quot; evolved into the word &quot;Safen&quot;, which later became &quot;Safin&quot;. The word &quot;Safin&quot; may have been the first word used to describe the Samnite people and the Samnite Kingdom. Etymologically, this name is generally recognized to be a form of the name of the Sabines, who were Umbrians. From &quot;Safinim&quot;, &quot;Sabinus&quot;, &quot;Sabellus&quot; and &quot;Samnis&quot;, an Indo-European root can be extracted, *&quot;sabh&quot;-, which becomes &quot;Sab-&quot; in Latino-Faliscan and &quot;Saf-&quot; in Osco-Umbrian: &quot;Sabini&quot; and *&quot;Safineis&quot;. Some archaeologists believe &quot;Safin&quot; refers to all the people of the Italian peninsula, others say just the people of Molise. It could also be an adjective used to describe a group of people. It appears on graves near Abruzzo from the 5th century, as well as Oscan inscriptions and slabs in Penna Sant&#x27;Andrea. The last known usage of the word is on a coin from the Social War.

&quot;Safin&quot; would go through a series of changes culminating in &quot;Safinim&quot;, the Oscan word for Samnium, meaning &quot;cult place of the &quot;Safin&quot; people&quot;.&quot;&quot; This became the word for the Samnite people, &quot;Safineis&quot;. as well as other words in Greek such as &quot;Saini&quot;, &quot;Saineis&quot;, &quot;Samnītēs,&quot; &quot;Sabellī,&quot; and &quot;Saunìtai&quot;. These terms likely originated in the 5th century BC and derive from &quot;saunion&quot;, the Greek word for javelin.

At some point in prehistory, a population speaking a common language extended over both Samnium and Umbria. Salmon conjectures that it was common Italic and puts forward a date of 600 BC, after which the common language began to separate into dialects. This date does not necessarily correspond to any historical or archaeological evidence; developing a synthetic view of the ethnology of proto-historic Italy is an incomplete and ongoing task.

Linguist Julius Pokorny carries the etymology somewhat further back. Conjecturing that the -a- was altered from an -o- during some prehistoric residence in Illyria, he derives the names from an o-grade extension *&quot;swo-bho-&quot; of an extended e-grade *&quot;swe-bho-&quot; of the possessive adjective, *&quot;s(e)we-&quot;, of the reflexive pronoun, *&quot;se-&quot;, &quot;oneself&quot; (the source of English &quot;self&quot;). The result is a set of Indo-European tribal names (if not the endonym of the Indo-Europeans): Germanic Suebi and Semnones, Suiones as well as Swedes; Celtic Senones; Slavic Serbs and Sorbs; Italic Sabelli, Sabini, etc., as well as a large number of kinship terms.

== History ==

=== Origins and early history ===

The Greek geographer Strabo wrote that the Samnite civilization originated from a group of Sabine exiles. According to this account, during either a famine, or as part of an attempt to end a war with the Umbrians, the Sabines vowed to hold a Ver Sacrum. As part of this ritual, all things produced that year were sacrificed, including babies. Once these babies had reached adulthood they were exiled, and then guided by a bull to their new homeland. Upon reaching this land they sacrificed this bull to Mars. Other Samnite tribes claimed to have been guided by different animals. The Hirpini claimed they were guided by a wolf, and the Picentes claimed to have been guided by a woodpecker. Alternatively, the Samnites may have been connected to Sparta. This legend is possibly apocryphal. It might have been created by the Greeks for an alliance with the Samnites, or to include the Italic peoples within their worldview, and possibly to highlight similarities between the Samnites and Spartans. Archaeological evidence shows that Samnite civilization likely developed from a preexisting Italian culture.

After the Etruscans abandoned Campania in the 5th century, the Samnites conquered the region. Cities like Pompeii and Herculaneum were conquered. It is unclear what Samnite cities took part in the campaign, or why. They could have wanted its fertile soil, or to alleviate overpopulation. This theory relies on the Samnites having a poor agricultural industry, which is contradicted by other evidence. Alternatively, the Samnites could have wanted access to the Volturno River and other resources. Once Greek hegemony in Italy waned, the Samnites invaded and conquered much of their former land. They conquered cities like Cumae, only failing to take Naples. In the ensuing centuries, they would wage more war against the Campanians, Volscians, Epirot Greeks, and other Latin communities.

=== Samnite Wars ===
The Samnites and Romans first came into contact after the Roman conquest of the Volscians. In 354 BC, they agreed to set their border at the Liris River. Livy, a Roman historian who serves as a source on the Samnite Wars, states that when the Samnites attacked the Campanians, the latter civilization formed an alliance with the Romans. Igniting war between them and the Samnites in 343 BC. This account of the war&#x27;s cause is not universally accepted by modern historians. Livy may be writing propaganda or trying to compare this war to other conflicts. After three Samnite defeats and a Roman invasion, the Samnites agreed to sign a peace treaty.

There are two accounts of the cause of the Second Samnite War. Possibly, Rome declared war due to a Samnite alliance with the Vestini and wars against Fregellae and Paleopolis. Additionally, the Romans wished to use the economic prosperity of the city of Venafrum for their own benefit. Conflict may have also emerged because the Samnites desired to solidify their hold over crucial economic positions. After the Roman defeat at the Battle of the Caudine Forks both sides agreed to an armistice. Fighting resumed in 326 BC. The war ended after a Roman campaign into Apulia and Samnium. Following the end of the war, the Romans annexed Bovianum and Fregellae, and forced the Samnites out of Apulia.

In 298 BC, the Third Samnite War broke out due to tension over the Lucanians, who had asked Rome for protection. On another front, treaties between the Romans and Picentes caused conflict with the Etruscans. This war came to end after the Samnite defeat at the Battle of Aquilonia. Afterwards, Samnium was conquered and the Samnites were assimilated into Roman society.

=== Later history ===

The Samnites were one of the Italian peoples that allied with King Pyrrhus of Epirus during the Pyrrhic War. After Pyrrhus left for Sicily, the Romans invaded Samnium and were crushed at the Battle of the Cranita Hills, but after the defeat of Pyrrhus, the Samnites could not resist on their own and surrendered to Rome. Some of them joined and aided Hannibal during the Second Punic War, but most stayed loyal to Rome. After the Romans refused to grant the Samnites citizenship, they, along with other Italic peoples, rebelled against the Romans. This war, known as the Social War, lasted almost four years and resulted in a Roman victory. After this bloody conflict, Samnites and other Italic tribes were granted citizenship to avoid the possibility of another war.

The Samnites supported the faction of Marius and Carbo in the civil war against Sulla. The Samnites and their allies were led by Pontius Telesinus and a Lucanian named Marcus Lamponius. They gathered an army of 40,000 men and fought a battle against Sulla at the Colline Gates. After their defeat in the battle, and subsequently the war, Pontius was executed.

As a consequence of Sulla&#x27;s victory and his establishment as dictator of Rome he ordered the punishment of those who had opposed him. Samnites, who were some of the most prominent supporters of the Marians, were punished so severely that it was recorded, &quot;some of their cities have now dwindled into villages, some indeed being entirely deserted.&quot; The Samnites did not play any prominent role in history after this, and they were Latinized and assimilated into the Roman world. Several of their gentes would go on to achieve high distinction, including the Cassii, the Herennii, Pontii and the Vibii.

== Society ==

=== Economy ===

Most of Samnium consisted of rugged and mountainous terrain lacking in natural resources. This resulted in a mixed economy focused on using the small amounts of fertile land to practice highly developed forms of subsistence agriculture, mixed farming, animal husbandry, sheep farming, pastoralism, and smallholdings. The prosperity of the Samnite agricultural industry likely resulted in conflicts between them and other civilizations, and possibly one of the causes of the Samnite Wars.

The prominence of pastoralism and livestock in the Samnite economy was also a consequence of their homeland&#x27;s terrain. Horses, poultry, cattle, goats, pigs, and sheep were all common and important kinds of livestock. These animals were valued because they could serve as a tradeable good, and as a source of food. Transhumance, or the seasonal movement of livestock from summer to winter pastures, was an important aspect of the Samnite economy. Annual short distance transhumance formed the basis of the aristocracy&#x27;s wealth. Long distance transhumance was practiced between Apulia and Samnium.

During the fifth and fourth centuries BC, an increasing population combined with trade links to other Italians contributed to further agricultural and urban development. This change was most drastic in Larinum. The city began as a major grain producer with a mill and a threshing floor, and later developed into the hub for all economic activity in the Biferno Valley. The Samnites exported goods such as cereals, cabbages, olives, olive oil, wine, bronze, iron, textiles, legumes, and vines. They also imported materials such as bronze bowls and bucchero from places like Campania, Etruria, Latium, Apulia, and Magna Graecia. These trade networks resulted in the adoption of products and ideas from other cultures such as the Sabines, Latins, and Etruscans.

Samnite currency developed in the late fifth and early fourth centuries BC, likely as a consequence of interaction with the Greeks, and war, which created a need for mercenaries. Their bronze or silver currency might have been produced in Naples, and then &quot;ordered&quot; from the city&#x27;s workshops. Alternatively, Samnite cities might have supplied the materials necessary for making currency. Or coins could have been imported from cities that Samnite mercenaries worked for. Such as Taranto. Currency at this time generally depicted places like Allifae, Nola, Philistia, or peoples such as the Campani. These images are associated with the development of the Samnite political structure. Coins may have not been used by individuals, but instead by government institutions to finance administrative tasks. Following this early period of high currency production, the Samnites began to mint less money. 
Wool and leather were likely harvested by the Samnites in significant quantities, as evidenced by the numerous loom weights found throughout Samnium. Most loom weights used incised lines, dots, oval stamps, gem impressions, or imprints from metal signet rings to create patterns. Common patterns included pyramids, stars, or dotted or incised cross motifs. Motifs could have been shaped like leaves, flowers, pomegranates, or mythological figures. One loom weight from the town of Locri is decorated with a gem impression of a satyr playing the lyre. Numerous pieces of Samnite pottery with Greek words incised into them have been found. These Greek words may have served a variety of possibilities, such as instructing the weaver how to order the threads in the textile patterns, or they could also have marked the piece&#x27;s quality. The Greek inscriptions may also have stated the weight of either the loom weight or the cloth, and possibly the cloth&#x27;s dimensions.

The Samnites also produced amphorae, terracottas, and impasto pottery with black gloss. Protective coating, also called varnish, was used to cover pottery and amphorae. Most amphorae came from Rhodes, and pottery was commonly purchased from Greece. Pottery was also rarely imported from North Africa or areas by the Adriatic. After the urbanization of Samnite society, the production of Hellenistic or Italian pottery dramatically increased. Ceramics, pottery, and amphorae often used patterns. The majority of these patterns were trademarks or signatures from the craftsmen. On other occasions, they depicted places such as the island of Rhodes, or named government officials., such as the Meddíss Túvtíks. One example of a pottery stamp is:

=== Government ===
Throughout the Iron Age Samnium was ruled by chieftains and aristocrats who used funerary displays to flaunt their wealth. During the early third and fourth centuries, the Samnite political system developed into an organization focused on rural settlements led by magistrates. The Samnite settlements, or &quot;vici&quot;, were at the bottom of the Samnite social hierarchy. They were grouped into cantons called &quot;pagi&quot;, which were run by an elected official known as a &quot;meddiss&quot;. The &quot;pagi&quot; were organized into &quot;toutos&quot;, which were the Samnite tribes. Each &quot;touto&quot; was led by an annually elected official with supreme executive and judicial powers called the &quot;meddíss túvtiks.&quot;

Political entities similar to councils, assemblies, or senates such as the &quot;kombennio&quot; possibly existed. The &quot;Kombennio&quot; was a democratic organization in Pompeii responsible for electing officials, as well as making laws and enforcing them. Senates were located at the capitals of the Samnite tribes, such as Bovianum, the Pentrian capital. It is unclear if these forms of government existed before the Roman conquest. Despite these democratic institutions, Samnite society was still dominated by a small group of aristocratic families such as the &quot;Papii&quot;, &quot;Statii&quot;, &quot;Egnatii&quot;, and &quot;Staii&quot;.
Each Samnite tribe functioned independently from the others. However, a union similar to the Latin League would occasionally form between the tribes. Such an alliance would be primarily militaristic, with a commander and chief enforcing all laws enacted by the alliance. In order for the alliance to pass legislation, leading men of each tribe would have to unanimously agree before a bill could become a law. Such an alliance was rare, and even if some tribes unified others might refuse to unite with the other tribes. The Frentani was another Italic tribe that might have been included in this alliance, however, their importance to the union might be exaggerated. The relevance of the Samnite tribes in this organization might also be exaggerated; cities could have had more political power.

This system of government maintained itself after the Roman conquest of Samnium albeit with some reductions in power. The &quot;touto&quot; and &quot;pagus&quot; began to function as miniature Republics, while the &quot;vicus&quot; remained unchanged. The only interference from the Romans would be that the Municipum held authority over all previous institutions and could override them, while the prefectures had little authority over the Samnites.

=== Military ===
Roman historians believed that Samnite society was highly militaristic. They feared Samnite cavalry and infantry, and nicknamed them &quot;Belliger Samnis&quot;, which translates to &quot;Warrior Samnites&quot;. It is unclear if this portrayal is accurate as most Roman historical accounts of the Samnites were written after this civilization had disappeared. Much of this work could also be propaganda. In the early periods of Samnite history, the military consisted of trained warriors led by local leaders. Access to the military (and military equipment) was dependent on one&#x27;s wealth and status, while poorer and lower status individuals were relegated to work such as agriculture. Samnite soldiers would have been trained in the triangular forum in Pompeii from an early age as part of a group known as the &quot;Vereiia&quot;. The &quot;Vereiia&quot; evolved into a community service group after the Roman conquest. During the Samnite Wars, the army evolved to resemble the armies of Ancient Greek city states. This new system used phalanxes, hoplites, maniples, and cohorts made of 400 men, creating an army flexible enough to fight in mountainous terrain. Low class soldiers began to be conscripted into the army, increasing its size to several thousand soldiers, although these recruits were less skilled and poorly trained.

Livy mentions a &quot;legio linteata&quot; (&quot;linen legion&quot;); this unit used flamboyant equipment to differentiate itself from other Samnite warriors. According to Livy, this legion took an oath to never flee battle inside a linen structure. Scholars believe that this description was designed to highlight the differences between the &quot;civilized&quot; Romans, and the barbaric enemies of Rome. Livy also could have been attempting to try and convey Samnite historical and religious power through a single unit. Due to corroborating archaeological evidence, other scholars state that it would be &quot;rash&quot; to completely dismiss this entire story.

==== Armor ====

Samnite soldiers wore a small single disc breastplate. This breastplate, called the kardiophylax consisted of straps that passed around the shoulders, chest, and back, and attached around points. Although the triple-disc cuirass offered more protection, this armor continued to be used as a status symbol. There were three types of triple-disc cuirasses. The first used bronze to fill the space between the three identical discs. Small rings were attached to this bronze, and side straps were used to hold the armor together. Shoulder straps were also fastened to these small rings. The second type utilized an edge to outline the discs, while the third used plates to depict the heads of religious figures such as Athena or demons. All three types were constructed by placing a disc below and between two upper discs forming a triangular shape.

Broad belts made of leather, gold, or bronze were common pieces of armor, and significant to Samnite culture. They were likely dedicated to protecting the abdomen. Samnite belts were made by heating up tin alloys at 800 degrees Celsius. Afterward, work would be performed on the belt at a temperature ranging from 600 to 800 degrees Celsius. Hammers and abrasives were used to grind the strips, giving them the appearance of silver. When making the belts, a thermal treatment was used in repeated cycles to increase the durability of the material.

Samnite helmets were based on Greek military equipmentthey used cheek guards, crests, and plumes. Crests were usually made by fastening horse tails to a metal piece that hung at the back of the helmet. Rivets could also be used to pin crests to the helmet&#x27;s peak. Another type of crest was thin and bushy with long free-flowing ends. Feathers and horns were a common feature of Samnite crests and plumes. Soldiers would don their greaves by resting their leg on a rock whilst using their hands to test the fit of the equipment. This piece of equipment reached down to the ankle and was likely custom-made to fit the owner. There are few depictions of Samnite soldiers wearing graves, implying that they were rarely used outside of rituals and &quot;mock-fights.&quot;

==== Weaponry ====

Projectiles such as spears and javelins were commonly used by the Samnites. Spearheads were made from two bronze or iron parts. The upper part was the spearhead proper, and a lower part, which used a tube to hold up the end of a wooden shaft. To fasten the shaft to the spearhead, nails were driven through a hole in the shaft. Tubes were used to fit the spear into a bronze chape, which would protect the wooden shaft. Projectile weaponry was so essential to Samnite tactics that if a soldier ran out of projectiles, they would throw rocks off the ground.

Alongside spears, soldiers would use swords or even hand-to-hand combat. Depictions on pottery, and figurines such as the Capestrano Warrior showcase Samnite soldiers using a kind of Bronze Age sword called an antenna sword. Another kind of sword associated with the Samnite civilization is the short sword. Short swords were carried using a long strap fastened to either the warrior&#x27;s body or the sword&#x27;s hilt. Samnite art depicts soldiers receiving swords in ritual ceremonies, and warriors eager to receive swords, implying that short swords were highly valued in Samnite society. Maces were rarer than spears or javelins, yet still common. They had heavy and undecorated iron heads attached to a handle hoisted with a hole or a socket. Axes were rarely used; they may have primarily been symbols of power.

There is little archaeological record of the Samnite shield, as most of the remaining shields have had much of their components destroyed. Samnite art commonly depicts Samnite soldiers using a round shield called an &quot;aspis&quot;. To carry the shield, two straps were used. One strap was leather, decorated with patterns, and ran vertically over the middle of the shield. Another strap used to provide a firm grip ran vertically near the shield&#x27;s edge. Alongside &quot;aspides&quot;, the Samnites possibly used bronze oval shields with pointed ends and incised decorations. It is possible that the Samnites used &quot;scuta&quot;. It is also possible that the Samnite &quot;scutum&quot; influenced the Roman shield; however, evidence for this is unclear. Samnite art depicts their soldiers carrying &quot;scuta&quot;; however, it is either as trophies taken from the enemy or an attempt to mimic ancient Greek art. Livy states that the Samnite shield was broad near the shoulder and chest, but thinner closer to the feet. Archaeological evidence does not substantiate this idea. Livy possibly mistook the equipment of a Samnite gladiator for that of a Samnite soldier.

== Culture ==

=== Religion ===

Superstition dominated Samnite culture. They believed magic could influence reality and practiced augury. Vaguely defined spirits called &quot;numina&quot; were also prominent in Samnite mythology. It was essential to establish proper relations with these spirits, which evolved into the Samnite gods and goddesses. Few of these Samnite deities are known. It is known that gods such as Vulcan, Diana, and &quot;Mefitis&quot; were all worshipped, with Mars being the most prominent in the Samnite religion. To honor their gods, votive offerings and animals would be sacrificed. In a practice known as the &quot;Ver Sacrum&quot;, all things produced in a particular year would be exiled or offered to the gods. The description of these practices may have been fabricated by Livy for propaganda purposes.

Samnite gravesites often contained goods. For example, wealthy individuals had graves with statues or steles. These goods indicated the wealth and status of the individual in life. Burials required that certain practices be observed in order to bury the dead adequately. Burial was likely a sign of social status as it was rare to be buried, despite the Samnite belief in an afterlife.

Sanctuaries were important to the Samnite religion. They served a variety of purposes: they siphoned money off transhumance routes, marked borders, served as centers for communication and places of worship, and played a role in government. Over time, sanctuaries become much less prominent in Samnite culture, and were all abandoned soon afterwards.

=== Gender roles ===

There were two major roles for Samnite women: domestic and ceremonial. Women would weave, which likely played an important role in the economy. They also likely exercised a small amount of political power through the symposium, which was a kind of ancient Greek or Etruscan banquet. Other responsibilities included teaching young girls how to dance, childrearing, and possibly managing the household. Relationships between Samnite wives and husbands are unclear. Libation scenes might suggest that a wife was supposed to be dutiful and loyal to her husband. Women may have been expected to be disciplinedin Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot; he complains about women lacking these traits. He possibly based his expectations of women on Samnite customs. Another possibility is that women were capable of acquiring large amounts of wealth. However, they might have only been capable of displaying their partner&#x27;s wealth. Artwork and pottery depicting Samnite women showcase them involved in rituals or nearby altars with votive offerings. These rituals usually involve women honoring their husbands through offerings of wine, or possibly praying for their husbands before they leave to fight.

The geographer Strabo states that the Samnites would take ten virgin women and ten young men, who were considered to be the best representation of their sex, and marry them. Following this, the second-best women would be given to the second-best males. This would continue until all 20 people had been assigned to one another. It is possible that the &quot;best&quot; men and women were chosen based on athletic capabilities. If any of the individuals involved dishonored themselves, they would be displaced and forcibly separated from their partners.

Samnite society may have enforced a distinction between men, who were supposed to be warriors, and women, who were supposed to be &quot;bejeweled&quot;. Ancient historians describe the Samnites as a warlike people; however much of this is possibly propaganda. Campanian pottery often depicts Samnite warriors and cavalrymen fighting, while Apulian pottery tends to depict them in a wider variety of circumstances. Pottery from those same cultures also depicts armed men involved with other activities such as burying the dead or marriage. Differences between male and female graves also support this theory. Men were buried with weapons and armor, while women were buried with domestic goods such as spindles or jewelry. Young adult women were typically buried with coils, pendants, beads, clothing, spindles, and fibulae similar to those worn by boys, possibly meaning that femininity was tied to youth in Samnite culture. Men wore much smaller and less elaborate fibulae, possibly indicating that the male identity was tied to maturity. The skeletons of men and women also show differences in trauma. Male skeletons found near Pontecagnano Faiano have a cranial trauma rate of 13%, while only 8% of female skeletons showed cranial trauma. Another community at Alfedena has male Samnite skeletons with similar rates of cranial injury. This indicates that Samnite men may have been expected to serve as warriors and fight, while women were not. 

However, a large number of graves are not buried with their respective gender&#x27;s items. Samnite men have been buried with goods typically associated with women, and a few Samnite women have been buried with goods associated with men. Only 3% of men in Campo Consolino were buried with their respective gender&#x27;s goods, while one in five women were buried with weaponry. Men have also been found buried with domestic goods. This could be explained if these goods were not indicative of the person&#x27;s responsibilities in life, but instead were offerings to the dead. The rarity of certain burial goods could indicate that they were exclusive to high-status individuals. For example, jewelry could be explained as an indication of wealth or femininity. Differences in jewelry between the graves of adolescent and young adult women could be a form of preventative healthcare; it may have been done to protect them in childbirth.

Analysis of skeletons has shown that both genders have fractures, lesions, and injuries, although men have these injuries much more commonly. This difference could be explained by greater amounts of male skeletons than female skeletons. Other skeletons showcase similarities between the lives of men and women. For example, both have healthy teeth, implying that they had healthy diets with low amounts of carbohydrates. The art depicts groups of both men and women honoring both dead men and women, indicating that Samnite men and women could be honored in similar ways after death. Each gender may have had different, but equally important roles. Another possibility is that the Samnites had two categories for gender, one being adult males, and the other, everyone else.

The Samnites possibly practiced ritualized prostitution. Young women of all social standings would engage in sexual activities as a rite of passage. It is possible this practice would transform from a ritual into a profession.

=== Art ===

The first art style used by the Samnites in Pompeii developed when Greek painters traveled to Italy to paint for local aristocrats. It borrows elements from Greek, Etruscan, and other Italic art. For example, hierarchy of scale, clothing demonstrating status, captions, episodic narratives, and depictions of history were all borrowed from other cultures.

Samnite art featured polychrome murals and paintings. The murals usually used black or red cement pavements outlined with designs that ran across tesserae. There were two different styles of tesserae: worm-like, or &quot;miculatum&quot;, and woven-style, or &quot;oppus tessellatum,&quot;. &quot;Miculatum&quot; consisted of inserting marble and terracotta trays into a mosaic floor. The &quot;oppus tessellatum&quot; style used tesserae to create an appearance resembling weaving. Samnite art was usually colorful, and it often depicted myths, warriors, or Greek subjects. Murals found in Pompeii were designed to create an idyllic sense.

Aside from the murals, other works of Samnite art have survived to the modern day. On the walls of a sanctuary at Pietrabbondate there is an unidentifiable relief that is possibly an atlas. Another possible work of Samnite or Roman origin in Isernia depicts two helmeted warriors. One example of Samnite figurative art may be the Warrior of Capestrano. The statue was, however, found in Vestini territory and depicts a Picentine warrior.

=== Clothing ===
Most Samnite clothes were loose, pinned, draped, folded, and not stitched or sewn. Clothing held symbolic and ritual purposes in Samnite society. For example, clothing indicated social status, and chitons were often used in ceremonies. The most valuable kind of clothing was a fastened bronze or leather girdle covered in bronze.

Men wore rings, amulets with snake heads, and collars. Collars were usually pierced with holes from which they suspended amulets and pendants and engraved with incised decorations. Collars would be given to the man in boyhood, and never removed. Bearskins were also common clothing.

Female clothing was similar to Greek apparel. Women wore long sleeveless peplum, caps, hats similar to a pileus, chitons, decorated belts, and chatelaine. The chatelaine had a central section consisting of mail and metal spirals made from perforated discs of metal. An essential part of Samnite women&#x27;s clothing was garments long enough to touch the ground. These were worn alongside colored capes that were fastened beneath the chin and held together with a brooch. Samnite capes covered the whole upper body, the arms, and the legs, although necklaces and amulets remained visible, as the neckline of the cape did not touch the shoulders. Women also wore another kind of cape similar to a jacket. This jacket had sleeves, was fastened at the front, used a low-cut neckline, and fit the body tightly, covering much of it with folding. The frontal part of the jacket hung just below the waist, which is also nearby where it was kept. Samnite skirts were heavily influenced by Greek clothing. They covered with a himation that usually also covered the hips as well as drapery. Women wore headdresses made from a folded piece of cloth. One depiction of this kind of headdress shows it as a long veil that was folded and ran across the head. Another piece of art shows a Samnite woman wearing a hairnet beneath a cylindrical headdress with white and red stripes running across it. Some kinds of clothing were gender neutral. Red, white, or black belts covered in motifs that were usually made by using hooks to fasten cloth or leather into holes were worn by both genders.
It was common in ancient Samnium for both men and women to wear no footwear. Despite this, numerous shoe styles still existed. Some shoes were low, some reached to the ankles, and others had a small hole at their tip. Another kind used an accentuated upper edge and reached higher than the ankles. Styles of footwear did not vary greatly between gender, except for styles of boot. Female boots were usually ankle-high, while male boots reached higher. To secure the lacing of the shoe, white buttons and pointed, curved, or short lines that ran across horizontal laces could be used. Samnite sandals had white soles that used a strap to attach the soles to the foot. One kind of sandal left the foot uncovered, while the other covered it up. Socks may have existed in ancient Samnium. If they did not, an alternative could have existed, such as a sort of soft fabric used as a replacement for socks.

Italic pottery and Samnite tomb paintings depict Samnite warriors wearing tunics. These were usually made from one piece of cloth and decorated with black or white motifs that were almost always placed on the sleeves, though rarely on the lower part of the tunic. Common motifs included stripes or dots. Tunics were held together at the midriff by broad leather belts.

Livy describes Samnite soldiers wearing two kinds of clothing. One was referred to as versicolor, meaning the clothing used contrasting colors. These clothes might have been designed to give a chameleon-like appearance Livy may have intended to invoke ideas of Aeneas, who once allied with a warrior named Astyr, who had multi-colored weapons and armor. It also may have been designed to showcase the worthiness of the Samnites as opponents of Rome. These are not the only possibilitiesLivy may have wanted to reference Plato&#x27;s Republic, which compares Republics to a multi-colored garment. Also, multi-colored clothing may have symbolized wealth. The other group of Samnites wore silver clothing and carried weapons.

=== Recreation ===

Drinking and eating were very important to the life of the Samnites. It served as a way to entertain, and to establish social networks, and to negotiate politics or labor. Whilst eating, the host would distribute food and drink to the guests. It was rare for wine to be given to adult men, although it was consumed by other demographics. Banquets used large containers or mixing vessels, serving vessels, and small pieces for individuals&#x27; consumption. Large containers were often amphorae or kraters. Serving vessels were usually dippers, or jugs. The smaller vessels were usually cups, beakers, kylikes, and kantharoi. It was common to import these goods, for example, bucchero was commonly imported from Etruria.

Gladiatorial games may have originated in Samnium. Roman and Greek authors such as Livy, Strabo, Horace, Athenaeus, and Silius Italicus mention that the Campanian aristocrats would host gladiator games during their banquets. It is possible that the Samnite gladiator originated from these Oscan and Samnite games. However, evidence for this is inconclusive. Other scholars believe that gladiatorial games originated from Etruria, the Celts, or the city of Mantineia. The word &quot;lanista&quot; may imply a connection between gladiatorial games and the Etruscans. Although the earliest gladiators were called Samnites, the word &quot;lanista&quot; may have no connection to the Etruscans. Art from Campania depicts Samnites in gladiatorial games. One piece of art depicts a dead gladiator with a spear stuck in the head. This indicates that the Samnites likely were not averse to brutality. Art also showcases large gladiatorial games alongside chariot racing and banquets, implying that Samnite gladiatorial games were grandiose and for entertainment. Alternatively, these games may have been conducted at funerals. Games are usually depicted taking place near funerals, and pomegranates are depicted in the background, which was symbols of the afterlife. The warriors in these funerary games are depicted wearing colorful armor.

Chariot racing and hunting with projectile weaponry were recreational activates practiced by Samnite men. In Pompeii, ancient baths were built during the time the Samnites ruled the city.

=== Cities and engineering ===

From the Bronze to the Iron Age, the number of Samnite settlements drastically increased. Most of these settlements were small, with most people living in hamlets and working for a living. These small settlements organized around larger settlements, such as Saepinum and Caiatia. Samnite cities were generally not as large as those in the rest of Italy. They were largely disorganized, and generally lacked urban centers. Roads called &quot;tratturi&quot; were used to connect the summer pastures to those of winter. Alongside these roads, Samnite cities had buildings such as temples, dining complexes, houses, and sanctuaries. Their cities had no buildings similar to a forum or an Agora, except for the city of Pompeii, which had a small forum with irregular architecture and tabernae.

Samnite cities began to develop walls and other defensive fortifications during the Samnite Wars. Walls were usually rough and crude, and located by the crest of a hill with no other defenses nearby. This indicated that they were built to allow the defending army to retreat and regroup, rather than protect the city. City gates were heavily fortified on the left side, but not on the right. This was done to force soldiers to attack the city on the side they were not holding their shield on.

Hillforts built with polygonal walling may have been either a common defensive fortification or a form of settlement that represented a transitional phase between a more rural society and a more urban one. It is unclear if these hillforts were permanent defenses as they may have only been inhabited temporarily. Scholars have proposed other possible purposes for the Samnite hillforts. They may have played a role in government. Forts may have also been used to pass along signals by fire.
Samnite architecture in Pompeii or Herculaneum often resembled that of Greek architecture. For example, palaestras, colonnades, stoai, and columns were all borrowed from the Greeks. Other techniques were borrowed from the Etruscans. Such as breaking up orthostates with narrow blocks. The Samnite palaestra in Pompeii is made from a rectangular courtyard surrounded by porticos and Doric columns made of tufa. A peristyle courtyard lies to the west of the palaestra. This building was similar to Greek palaestra, and was likely either a gymnasium, religious site, or a campus. Houses were built on foundations topped with smaller blocks laid in courses. In order to elevate the foundation, dados and orthostats were inserted into the fauces. Blocks of stone also needed to be put alongside the base of the wall. Walls were usually made of rubble. The rubble could have been carved to make it resemble carved blocks of stone, rather than rubble. Alongside this practice, layers of plaster were spread over it. Plaster was also used to make frescoes. This was done by applying pigment to the plaster whilst it was damp. Another construction material called stucco was often painted, creating the appearance of a house covered in marble. Atriums were a common feature of Samnite houses. They used impulviums, loggia, and cellae. Façades made of tuff, tabernae, peristyles, dentil cornices supported by cubic capitals, which are the upper part of a column, used figurines and were all located outside of the houses. Roofs with downspouts made of stone and tiles.

Small, personal, and makeshift farms or houses were common buildings. One farmhouse found near Campobasso consists of a square module, which was likely a stable house, and a series of rooms with hearths centered around a courthouse. The house has a small mortar line basin, a dolia, and other container vessels. Indicating that these materials were used for the process and storage of produce. Another farmstead was built in 200 BC using limestone blocks held together by yellow mortar. An archaeological site known as &quot;ACQ 11000&quot; had a terrace covered in thick clay, a walled space with a paved floor, and a stone wall.

<text>The HALO Trust (Hazardous Area Life-support Organization) is a humanitarian non-government organisation which primarily works to clear landmines and other explosive devices left behind by conflicts. With over 10,000 staff worldwide, HALO has operations in 28 countries. Its largest operation is in Afghanistan, where the organization continues to operate under the Taliban regime that took power in August 2021.

HALO&#x27;s global headquarters are located in Thornhill, Dumfries and Galloway, United Kingdom. HALO has offices in Salisbury, UK, Washington, D.C., and The Hague, Netherlands.
== History ==
The organisation was founded in 1988 by Guy Willoughby, former junior officer in the Coldstream Guards and Colin Campbell Mitchell, a British member of Parliament, former colonel in the British Army, and his wife Sue Mitchell. Willoughby won the Robert Burns Humanitarian Award in 2009. HALO&#x27;s first programme began operations in Afghanistan, clearing landmines left by the departing Soviet military. The next major programme to open, in 1991, was in Cambodia. HALO attracted global coverage in January 1997 when Diana Princess of Wales visited a minefield being cleared by HALO employees in Huambo, Angola.

== Leadership ==
In February 2015, James Cowan was appointed HALO&#x27;s chief executive officer. Cowan was a British Army major-general who commanded the 3rd (United Kingdom) Division during a 33-year army career.

Cowan replaced Guy Willoughby who resigned from his role as chief executive of the trust on 11 August 2014. 

==Support and financing==
HALO&#x27;s income in 2021-22 was £93.5 million up from £25.63 million in 2015-16. It receives support from the US, UK and other governments around the world including Finland, Norway, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland and New Zealand. In April 2017, the UK announced it would provide £100 million in funding for global landmine programmes for the next three years. In 2021 the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office announced plans to cut funding for landmine clearance from £100 million to £25 million.

==Achievements==
The HALO Trust has destroyed over 1.5 million landmines, over 11 million pieces of large calibre ordnance and over 200,000 cluster munitions. Around 10,800 minefields have been cleared and have been made safe from landmines, with another made safe from unexploded and abandoned ordnance.

===Awards===
In 2012, HALO was named the Overall Winner in the Charity Awards by Civil Society Media.

==Africa==
===Angola===
For more than 40 years, the population of Angola has been severely impacted by landmines and other explosive remnants of war (ERW), and is believed to still be one of the most mined countries in the world. Between 1962 and 1972, it is believed that there were a total of 2,571 landmine incidents in Angola. Estimates for the total number of ERW casualties in Angola vary hugely, from 23,000 to 80,000.

HALO has worked in Angola since 1994. Considerable progress is being made; even so, HALO estimates that there is still in the region of 10 years&#x27; work to rid Angola of all landmines.

To tackle the threat from anti-tank mines on roads, HALO developed the Road Threat Reduction (RTR) system. RTR is a two part process: first, systematic sweeps are made with a large detector to find metal-cased AT mines; this is followed by heavy detonation trailers designed to detonate any minimum metal mine still capable of operating. HALO also fields Weapons &amp; Ammunition Disposal teams working in support of the Angolan Army, Navy, Air Force and Police to manage the considerable stocks of weapons and ammunition that were amassed during the Angolan Civil War.

By 2015 HALO had cleared more than 780 minefields ( of land) and destroyed more than 90,000 landmines and 160,000 items of unexploded ordnance. The majority of munitions destroyed is made up of aircraft bombs but also includes guided missiles and cluster bomb sub-munitions. More than a decade after the end of the war, accidents continue to occur and communities continue to be impacted by the threat of mines.

===Mozambique===
The Government of Mozambique announced that the country was free of all known landmines in September 2015.

In September 2015, when Mozambique declared itself free of all known landmines, HALO announced that it had cleared 171,000 of the country&#x27;s landmines and employed 1,600 Mozambican men and women over the course of 22 years.

===Somalia===


Somaliland is an unrecognised de facto independent state located in northwest Somalia in the Horn of Africa.

Minelaying occurred during the 1964 Ethiopian–Somali Border War and 1977-78 Ogaden War with Ethiopia, when minefields were laid predominantly along the Ethiopian border. This border and important access routes were heavily mined.

==Asia==
===Caucasus===
==== Soviet Legacy minefields ====
In 2009, a national survey of minefields remaining in Georgia found a total of 15 contaminated sites. Of these 15, ten are identified as having a direct humanitarian impact. The clearance of minefields surrounding former Soviet military installations in Georgia is often complicated by significant quantities of waste and rubble. HALO have mechanical mineclearance techniques to clear such sites using adapted civil engineering plant such as armoured excavators and front-loading shovels.

==== Cluster munitions and other UXO ====
The American NGO CNFA partnered with HALO to target the delivery of agricultural assistance to the farmers of Shida Kartli; this resulted in the region&#x27;s largest ever apple and wheat harvests.

HALO completed work in this region in December 2009 having cleared of land across 22 communities. 1,706 cluster munitions and 2,031 other items of ordnance were located and destroyed.

====Nagorno Karabakh====

Since 2000 HALO has provided the only large-scale mine clearance capacity in Nagorno Karabakh and over the last 10 years HALO has cleared over 236 square kilometres of contaminated land and returned it to previously impacted communities. By mid-2010, HALO had found and destroyed in Nagorno Karabakh over 10,000 landmines, 10,000 cluster munitions and 45,000 other explosive items.

In July 2011 Azerbaijani government blacklisted and banned the organization from Azerbaijan in protest for its mine clearing operation in disputed territory of Nagorno Karabakh. Mine removal equipment that was headed to Afghanistan was impounded and sent to Georgia.

Representative of the leader of Nagorno-Karabakh on special assignments Boris Avagyan claimed that HALO Trust handed over minefield maps to Turkish special services, which, according to him, helped Azerbaijan’s successful military operations during the second Karabakh war in the fall of 2020. Ayvagyan claimed that under the pretext of studying dangerous areas, this organization carried out reconnaissance work throughout the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Opposition MP Naira Zohrabyan supported these claims. The spokesperson for the &quot;de facto&quot; president of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh said that Ayvagyan&#x27;s accusations do not represent the opinion of the government and that he was acting unilaterally. HALO Trust said the accusation was &quot;an absolute lie&quot;.

====Chechnya====

In 1997, HALO began working in Chechnya, training Chechens to remove landmines placed in the 1994–1996 war between Chechnya and Russia. It was forced to stop after a second war broke out and four deminers were killed by rocket artillery. Russia accused HALO of providing rebels with military training, but HALO representatives denied the charge, stating that they only provided their standard training in demining.

===Middle East===
====Jesus&#x27; baptism site====
In May 2016 HALO announced that it had secured approval from the Israeli and Palestinian authorities as well as eight religious denominations to clear landmines from the site of the Baptism of Christ at Qasr al-Yahud (West Bank) / Al-Maghtas (Jordan).

===Southeast Asia===
====Cambodia====

Over 63,500 landmine and ERW casualties have been recorded in Cambodia since 1979, with over 25,000 amputees Cambodia has the highest ratio per capita in the world. Despite a considerable reduction in casualty numbers over recent years, down from 875 in 2005 to 269 in 2008, Cambodia&#x27;s mine and ERW problem still represents a major impediment to the social and economic development of the country. However, given more than 18 years of humanitarian demining, the landmine threat is now largely concentrated in just 21 north-west border districts.

IN 2010 HALO Cambodia had over 1,150 national staff working in the provinces of Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Otdar Meanchey and Pailin. Recruiting, training and then deploying female and male deminers from the mine affected districts means that the landmine contaminated communities remain an integral component in the clearance process. Living and working in these communities, deminers are methodically ridding Cambodia of the landmine menace.

Between 1991 and May 2010, HALO Cambodia cleared over of landmine contaminated land whilst destroying over 229,000 landmines, 139,200 items of large calibre ammunition and 1.28 million bullets.

Alongside clearance work HALO&#x27;s survey teams have continued to systematically clarify the nature and magnitude of landmine contamination in Cambodia. The current focus of HALO&#x27;s survey teams is the Baseline Survey of Cambodia, a Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA) led process to quantify the true nature of the remaining mine threat in Cambodia.

====Laos====
One of the results of the Vietnam War (1964 to 1973) is the magnitude of the UXO problem remaining in Laos. During the conflict, the country was subject to heavy aerial bombardment, resulting in the world&#x27;s largest contamination from unexploded submunitions. The US estimates that it dropped over 2 million tons of bombs, including 270 million cluster munitions (known locally as &quot;bombies&quot;), during this period. During the same period, an unknown number of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines were laid along the country&#x27;s borders and around military bases and airfields.

While the number of mine and UXO related accidents continue to decrease from over 200 per year in the 1990s to about 50 in 2018, over 25% of all villages in Laos still remain contaminated, primarily with UXO.

HALO&#x27;s survey, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and UXO clearance program is focused on the four most contaminated districts in Savannakhet Province. As of 2017, its staff numbered 303 (45% women), forming 10 clearance teams and 14 survey teams. For 2018 it had permission to expand the efforts to 14 districts for a total of 538 villages.

=== South and Central Asia ===

==== Afghanistan ====
On 9 June 2021, a HALO Trust De-Mining Team was reportedly attacked in Afghanistan, with 10 team members killed and more than a dozen wounded. The Afghanistan government blamed the Taliban for the attack. The militant group denied any responsibility. HALO Trust stated that the Taliban actually came to their aid and scared off the assailants. ISIL-K claimed credit for the attack.

====Sri Lanka====
HALO has been working in Sri Lanka since 2002, with 1,045 demining staff currently in the provinces of Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mulaittivu. HALO teams conduct manual and mechanical mine clearance alongside survey and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD). In December 2015 The HALO Trust announced that it had cleared 200,000 landmines in Sri Lanka.

==Europe==
===Kosovo===
Mine laying, predominantly by the army of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia but also by the Kosovo Liberation Army, took place primarily in 1999. In addition to the many items of UXO resulting from the conflict, the NATO bombing campaign in 1999 left unexploded cluster munitions in many locations across Kosovo.

HALO maintained demining and battle area clearance operations between 2004 and 2006 and conducted a country-wide Community Liaison Survey in 2006 and 2007. This survey identified 126 areas still in need of clearance, above and beyond the 46 areas recorded in the national database. HALO commenced a third phase of clearance operations in May 2008.

In total since 1999, HALO has cleared over of mine contaminated land and of cluster munition contaminated land. In the process, HALO has destroyed 4,330 mines and 5,377 cluster submunitions and other explosive items.

Cluster munitions have an impact upon infrastructure projects and HALO has found and destroyed cluster munitions to clear the way for road widening projects. Occasionally clearance cannot keep up with development and at least one cluster munition was uncovered by road construction teams in 2010.

The World Bank&#x27;s Kosovo Poverty Assessment 2007 classifies 45 percent of Kosovo&#x27;s population as &quot;poor&quot;, living on less than €1.42 per day, with a further 18 percent considered to be vulnerable to poverty. 15% of the population is extremely poor, which is defined as &quot;individuals who have difficulty meeting their basic nutritional needs&quot;.

HALO currently has three teams and a total of 65 demining staff accredited and deployed clearing minefields and cluster munition strikes.

===Ukraine===
Since 2016 HALO is involved in clearing landmines laid during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, HALO continues to conduct clearance operations across Ukraine, employing over 600 Ukrainian staff. 

==South America==
===Colombia===
The Colombian military have now completed clearance of 31 of the minefields they laid but an estimated 10,000 suspected NSAG minefields remain. These have largely been the reason why Colombia now has similar landmine casualties to Afghanistan.

In 2013, Colombia had between 4.9 and 5.5 million internally displaced people (IDPs), the world&#x27;s largest number. These populations are now experiencing high casualty and accident rates as they return to their areas of former residence.

The Colombian government formally invited HALO Trust in June 2009 to implement a large-scale civilian clearance program which is currently in the survey and assessment stages.

HALO is the first civilian organisation to have a formal agreement and registration with the Colombian government and is currently surveying prioritised mined areas in preparation for humanitarian clearance operations.

<text>Rand McNally is an American technology and publishing company that provides mapping software and hardware for consumer electronics, commercial transportation, and education markets. The company is headquartered in Skokie, Illinois, with a distribution center in Richmond, Kentucky.

== History ==

===Early history===

In 1856, William H. Rand opened a printing shop in Chicago and two years later hired a newly arrived Irish immigrant, Andrew McNally, to work in his shop. The shop did big business with the forerunner of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and in 1859 Rand and McNally were hired to run the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s entire printing operation. In 1868, the two men, along with Rand&#x27;s nephew George Amos Poole, established Rand McNally &amp; Co. and bought the Tribune&#x27;s printing business. The company initially focused on printing tickets and timetables for Chicago&#x27;s booming railroad industry, and the following year supplemented that business by publishing complete railroad guides. In 1870, the company expanded into printing business directories and an illustrated newspaper, the &quot;People&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. According to company lore, during the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, Rand McNally quickly had two of the company&#x27;s printing machines buried in a sandy beach of Lake Michigan, and the company was up and running again only a few days later.

The first Rand McNally map, created using a new cost-saving wax engraving method, appeared in the December 1872 edition of its &quot;Railroad Guide&quot;. Rand McNally became an incorporated business in 1873; with Rand as its president, McNally as vice president, and George Poole as treasurer. The &quot;Business Atlas&quot;, containing maps and data pertinent to business planning, was first published in 1876. The atlas is still updated today, now titled the &quot;Commercial Atlas &amp; Marketing Guide&quot;. The Trade Book department was established in 1877, publishing such titles as &quot;The Locust Plague in the United States&quot;. Rand McNally began publishing educational maps in 1880 with its first line of maps, globes, and geography textbooks, soon followed by a world atlas. The company began publishing general literature in 1884 with its first title, &quot;The Secret of Success&quot;, and the Textbook department was established in 1894 with &quot;The Rand McNally Primary School Geography&quot;. Also in 1894, the company opened an office in New York City headed by Caleb S. Hammond, who later started his own map company, C. S. Hammond &amp; Co.

Rand McNally published its first road map, the &quot;New Automobile Road Map of New York City &amp; Vicinity&quot;, in 1904. In 1910, the company acquired the line of &quot;Photo-Auto Guides&quot; from G.S. Chapin, which provided photographs of routes and intersections with directions. Andrew McNally II (son of Frederick McNally) personally took photos on his honeymoon for the Chicago-to-Milwaukee edition. The company continued to expand its book publishing business, with best-selling children&#x27;s books such as &quot;The Real Mother Goose&quot; in 1916 and &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; in 1950.
Rand McNally was the first major map publisher to embrace a system of numbered highways. One of its cartographers, John Brink, invented a system that was first published in 1917 on a map of Peoria, Illinois. In addition to creating maps with numbered roads, Rand McNally also erected many of the actual roadside highway signs. This system was subsequently adopted by state and federal highway authorities. The oil industry quickly developed an interest in road maps, enticing Americans to explore and consume more gasoline. In 1920, Rand McNally began publishing road maps for the Gulf Oil Company, to be freely distributed at its service stations. By 1930, Rand McNally had two major road map competitors, General Drafting and Gousha, the latter of which was founded by a former Rand McNally sales representative. The &quot;Rand McNally Auto Chum&quot;, later to become the ubiquitous &quot;Rand McNally Road Atlas&quot;, debuted in 1924. The first full-color edition was published in 1960 and in 1993, it became fully digitized.

===Later history===
The &quot;Goode&#x27;s School Atlas&quot;, named for its first editor, Dr. J. Paul Goode, was published in 1923. It became a standard text for high school and college geography curricula. Later retitled &quot;Goode&#x27;s World Atlas&quot;, it is now in its 22nd edition. The first Rand McNally Travel Store was opened in New York City in 1937. In the 1990s it became a chain with 29 locations, but by 2005 all were closed as a cost-saving measure.
While Rand McNally is mainly known for its maps, in 1955 it published a book on random numbers. A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates
by RAND Corporation. This book was a product of RAND&#x27;s pioneering work in computing, as well a testament to the patience and persistence of researchers in the early days of RAND. The book was republished in 2001. This RAND edition reflects the original layout with the addition of a new foreword. Random numbers have been used in the computer industry, NASA, probability tables,in the gaming industry and also used in algorithms for encryption. In statistics, a normal distribution or Gaussian distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. Gaussian elimination method is used to solve a system of linear equations. In the 1950s this was the work of many mathematicians that put this book together. A sequel, A Million And One Random Digits was published in 2022.

Random number books have been rendered obsolete for most purposes by the ready availability of random number generators running on electronic computers. However they still have niche uses, particularly in the performance of experimental music pieces that call for them, such as Vision (1959) and Poem (1960) by La Monte Young.

Rand McNally moved its headquarters from Chicago to suburban Skokie, Illinois in 1952. The company opened its Versailles, Kentucky, book publishing plant in 1962 with and 23 employees. In 1994, the plant was the first to implement a new Kodak computer-to-plate printing system. When the plant was sold in 1997, it was over and employed 1,255 people.

In 1961, because the company was not satisfied with the ability of existing map projections to create intuitive depictions of the entire world, it commissioned Dr. Arthur H. Robinson to develop what became known as the Robinson projection, which became very popular and was used extensively for constructing maps of the entire world. Rand McNally began creating maps digitally in 1982.

In 1980, Rand McNally sold its educational publishing operations to Houghton Mifflin.

In 1989, Rand McNally donated its extensive collection of maps to the Newberry Library. Now in possession of Gousha&#x27;s archives as well, Rand McNally donated that map archive to the Newberry in late 2002.

With a string of acquisitions and growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Rand McNally employed over 4,000 people in four business groups. The company had been majority-owned by the McNally family since 1899, but by 1997 the family had decided to divest its interest.

In late September 2018, Rand McNally moved its headquarters back to Chicago, after more than 60 years in suburban Skokie, Illinois. West Bryn Mawr Avenue was chosen as the location for the site.

== Ownership ==
Rand McNally has always been a privately held company, with stock held by very few parties and very thinly traded. When Rand retired in 1899, he sold his shares in the company to McNally and the other company officers. The McNally family was the majority owner for nearly 100 years, from 1899 until 1997, at which time the family decided to divest its majority stake. The company was sold piecemeal; in January 1997, the company announced it was selling its Book Services Group, which employed 1,700 people in Versailles, Kentucky, and Taunton, Massachusetts, to World Color Press for $155 million. In February 1997, the DocuSystems Group, which printed airline tickets and luggage tags at its Nashville facility, was sold to Code Hennessy &amp; Simmons, a Chicago-based private equity firm. In April 1997, the Media Services Group, which employed 350 people with offices in Nashville, Tennessee; Fremont, California; Shannon, Ireland; and the Asia-Pacific region, was sold to McQueen Ltd., a Scottish software company.

The sole remaining group, publishing, represented the core mapmaking business of the company. In November 1997, the McNally family completed its divestiture by selling its majority ownership to AEA Investors for a reported $500 million. Much of the purchase price was leveraged, meaning the company took on significant debt hedging on future earnings. AEA intended to capitalize on Rand McNally&#x27;s brand recognition by bringing digital mapping to the masses and attracting public investors during the dot-com boom. However, the company fell behind the technology curve of upstarts such as MapQuest and fell further into debt. AEA&#x27;s stake in the company was acquired by Leonard Green &amp; Partners through a prepackaged Chapter 11 restructuring deal on January 15, 2003. In December 2007, Patriarch Partners, which had previously been a minority owner, bought shares owned by Leonard Green and other minority owners to become the sole owner of Rand McNally. In 2020, Teleo Capital purchased Rand McNally as sole owner.

== Facilities ==
Rand McNally had been headquartered in the Chicagoland area since its inception. Its 1899 headquarters on West Adams Street was the world&#x27;s first all-steel-framed skyscraper.

By the 1950s, its Chicago area workforce had grown to over 1,000 employees and larger facilities were needed. In 1952, it opened a new building in suburban Skokie, bringing corporate offices, printing, and distribution operations under one roof. Over the ensuing decades, however, printing and distribution operations relocated, eventually resulting in the underutilization of the aging Skokie building. It was sold in February 2008 to Ida Crown Jewish Academy for $11 million, and the approximately 200 current employees relocated in January 2009 to an office building near Skokie&#x27;s Old Orchard Mall. As of April 26, 2024 Rand McNally no longer has a physical address in the Chicagoland area after a round of layoffs following a merger with Safety Direct.

The Irvine, California, facilities from the acquisition of Thomas Bros. Maps in 1997 closed in 2010.

Rand McNally sold its Canadian subsidiary, located in Markham, Ontario, on June 30, 2008 to the newly formed Canadian Cartographics Corporation.

== Presidents and CEOs ==
William Rand founded his print shop in 1856 and Rand, McNally &amp; Co. was formally established in 1868. The company was incorporated in 1873 with Rand as the first president and McNally vice-president. When Rand retired in 1899, Andrew McNally assumed the role of president until his death in 1904. Andrew&#x27;s son, Frederick McNally, became president upon his father&#x27;s death, just as the age of the automobile was beginning. When Frederick McNally died in 1907, his sister&#x27;s husband, Harry Beach Clow, became president. Andrew McNally II took over in 1933. He and his heirs, Andrew McNally III and IV, successively served as president until 1993.

<text>The Bancroft Prize is awarded each year by the trustees of Columbia University for books about diplomacy or the history of the Americas.

It was established in 1948, with a bequest from Frederic Bancroft, in his memory and that of his brother, diplomat and attorney, Edgar Addison Bancroft.

The Bancroft Prize has been generally considered to be among the most prestigious awards in the field of American history writing. It comes with a $10,000 stipend (raised from $4,000 beginning in 2004). Seventeen winners had their work supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and 16 winners were also recipients of the Pulitzer Prize for History.

Following independent investigations, the Bancroft Prize was rescinded from Michael A. Bellesiles after he had received it in 2000.

<doc id="385477" wikidata="Q2900012" url="?curid=385477" title="Bet.e &amp; Stef">
<text>Bet.e &amp; Stef was a Canadian bossa nova and jazz group from Montreal, Quebec, consisting of vocalist and percussionist Elizabeth Provencher (Bet.e) and vocalist and guitarist Stéphane Carreau (Stef). They are best known for their 2002 album &quot;Day by Day&quot;, which sold 200,000 copies, and were nominated as Juno Award for New Group of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2003.

==History==
Bet.e &amp; Stef came together in the mid-1990s. Stef is a Montreal native who spent two years playing in Paris before returning to Montreal to study music. Bet.e, who is from Trois-Rivières, had studied modern dance before becoming a singer. The two performed for the first time when they were asked to sing at a wedding; they then became active in the Montreal club scene. The duo released two independent demo cassettes before releasing their debut album, &quot;Jazz/Bossa Nova&quot;, in 1997. They toured to support the album as an opening act for Holly Cole, and the album was eventually certified gold for sales of 50,000 copies.

In 2001, after Bet.e &amp; Stef were discovered by Toshiba-EMI Music Japan, that label released a version of &quot;Jazz/Bossa Nova&quot; called &quot;Wish You Well&quot;, which sold well in Japan. They then signed to Verve Records and followed up with &quot;Day by Day&quot; in 2002; &quot;Day by Day&quot; also attained gold certification in Canada. In 2003, the duo stopped performing and recording together, and worked on separate projects for about ten years. 

In 2013 Bet.e &amp; Stef reformed, and released the album &quot;Remix Deluxe&quot;, which contained new versions of some of their previously released material, and once again began performing in Montréal. In 2014 they performed at the Montréal en lumière festival, and released &quot;It&#x27;s All Right&quot;, a double album which was a mixture of remixes, previously released tracks and new material.

In 2015, Bet.e &amp; Stef released the album, &quot;Seeds&quot;, with eight new compositions. That year they also performed at the Montreal International Jazz Festival. 

In 2017, Provencher joined a trio called Eliza Eleven. Carreau has launched a solo career and works in film and television.

<doc id="385484" wikidata="Q262907" url="?curid=385484" title="List of Trotskyist internationals">
<text>This is a list of Trotskyist internationals. It includes all of the many political internationals which self-identify as Trotskyist.

Of the organizations listed, two claim to be the original Fourth International founded in 1938: the reunified Fourth International (USFI) and the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). The Fourth International split into two factions 1953 over the question of historic perspective, with the International Secretariat (ISFI) turning in favour of deep entryism and supporting petty-bourgeois nationalist movements in less developed countries, and the International Committee (ICFI) upholding the need to form revolutionary parties. The factions reunited in 1963 resulting in the formation of reunified Fourth International (USFI), while parts of the ICFI did not. Both the USFI and ICFI went on to fragment further, giving rise to several new internationals. 

Certain organizations which claim to be Trotskyist make no attempt to claim any relationship to the Fourth International in an organizational sense and argue that it no longer exists. Some claim to represent a continuity from the Fourth International or to have re-established it: for example the Fourth International (ICR) International Centre/Center of Reconstruction, also known as the FI (La Verité), also calls itself the &quot;Fourth International&quot;. 

The various organizations listed here range in size from those having thousands of adherents in dozens of countries to tendencies which can barely claim a dozen members in three or four countries.

<text>The Fugitive Slave Act or Fugitive Slave Law was a law passed by the 31st United States Congress on September 18, 1850, as part of the Compromise of 1850 between Southern interests in slavery and Northern Free-Soilers.

The Act was one of the most controversial elements of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a slave power conspiracy. It required that all escaped slaves, upon capture, be returned to the enslaver and that officials and citizens of free states had to cooperate. The Act contributed to the growing polarization of the country over the issue of slavery. It was one of the factors that led to the American Civil War.

==Background==

By 1843, several hundred enslaved people a year escaped to the North successfully, making slavery an unstable institution in the border states.

The earlier Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was a Federal law that was written with the intent to enforce Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution, which required the return of escaped slaves. It sought to force the authorities in free states to return fugitives of enslavement to their enslavers.

Many free states wanted to disregard the Fugitive Slave Act. Some jurisdictions passed personal liberty laws, mandating a jury trial before alleged fugitive slaves could be moved; others forbade the use of local jails or the assistance of state officials in arresting or returning alleged fugitive slaves. In some cases, juries refused to convict individuals who had been indicted under the Federal law.

The Missouri Supreme Court routinely held, with the laws of neighboring free states, that enslaved people whom their enslavers had voluntarily transported into free states, with the intent of the enslavers&#x27; residing there permanently or indefinitely, gained their freedom as a result. The 1793 act dealt with enslaved people who escaped to free states without their enslavers&#x27; consent. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled, in &quot;Prigg v. Pennsylvania&quot; (1842), that states did not have to offer aid in the hunting or recapture of enslaved people, significantly weakening the law of 1793.

After 1840, the Black population of Cass County, Michigan proliferated as families were attracted by White defiance of discriminatory laws, by numerous highly supportive Quakers, and by low-priced land. Free and escaping Blacks found Cass County a haven. Their good fortune attracted the attention of Southern slavers. In 1847 and 1849, planters from Bourbon and Boone counties, Kentucky, led raids into Cass County to recapture people escaping slavery. The attacks failed, but the situation contributed to Southern demands in 1850 to pass a strengthened fugitive slave act.

Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of people escaping enslavement, blaming the escapes on Northern abolitionists, whom they saw as stirring up their allegedly happy slaves, interfering with &quot;Southern property rights&quot;. According to the &quot;Columbus&quot; [Georgia] &quot;Enquirer&quot; of 1850, The support from Northerners for fugitive slaves caused more ill will between the North and the South than all the other causes put together.

==New law==
In response to the weakening of the original Fugitive Slave Act, Democratic Senator James M. Mason of Virginia drafted the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which penalized officials who did not arrest someone allegedly escaping from slavery, and made them liable to a fine of $1,000 (). Law enforcement officials everywhere were required to arrest people suspected of escaping enslavement on as little as a claimant&#x27;s sworn testimony of ownership. was declared irrelevant. The Commissioner before whom the fugitive from slavery was brought for a hearing—no jury was permitted, and the alleged refugee from enslavement could not testify—was compensated $10 () if he found that the individual was proven a fugitive and only $5 () if he determined the proof to be insufficient. In addition, any person aiding a fugitive by providing food or shelter was subject to up to six months of imprisonment and up to $1,000 in fine. Officers who captured a fugitive from slavery were entitled to a bonus or promotion for their work.

Enslavers needed only to supply an affidavit to a Federal marshal to capture a fugitive from slavery. Since a suspected enslaved person was not eligible for a trial, the law resulted in the kidnapping and conscription of free Blacks into slavery, as purported fugitive slaves had no rights in court and could not defend themselves against accusations.

The Act adversely affected the prospects of escape from slavery, particularly in states close to the North. One study finds that while prices placed on enslaved people rose across the Southern United States in the years after 1850, it appears that &quot;the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act increased prices in border states by 15% to 30% more than in states further south&quot;, illustrating how the Act altered the chance of successful escape.

According to abolitionist John Brown, even in the supposedly safe refuge of Springfield, Massachusetts, &quot;some of them are so alarmed that they tell me that they cannot sleep on account of either them or their wives and children. I can only say I think I have been enabled to do something to revive their broken spirits. I want all my family to imagine themselves in the same dreadful condition.&quot;

===Judicial nullification===

In 1855, the Wisconsin Supreme Court became the only state high court to declare the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional as a result of a case involving fugitive slave Joshua Glover and Sherman Booth, who led efforts that thwarted Glover&#x27;s recapture. In 1859 in &quot;Ableman v. Booth,&quot; the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the state court.

Jury nullification occurred as local Northern juries acquitted men accused of violating the law. Secretary of State Daniel Webster was a key supporter of the law, as expressed in his famous &quot;Seventh of March&quot; speech. He wanted high-profile convictions. The jury nullifications ruined his presidential aspirations and his last-ditch efforts to find a compromise between North and South. Webster led the prosecution against men accused of rescuing Shadrach Minkins in 1851 from Boston officials who intended to return Minkins to slavery; the juries convicted none of the men. Webster sought to enforce a law that was extremely unpopular in the Northern United States, and his Whig Party passed him over again when they chose a presidential nominee in 1852.

=== Legislative nullification ===

In November 1850, the Vermont legislature passed the Habeas Corpus Law, requiring Vermont judicial and law enforcement officials to assist captured fugitive slaves. It also established a state judicial process, parallel to the federal process, for people accused of being fugitive slaves. This law rendered the federal Fugitive Slave Act effectively unenforceable in Vermont and caused a storm of controversy nationally. It was considered a nullification of federal law, a concept popular among slave states that wanted to nullify other aspects of federal law, and was part of highly charged debates over slavery. Noted poet and abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier had called for such laws, and the Whittier controversy heightened pro-slavery reactions to the Vermont law. Virginia governor John B. Floyd warned that nullification could push the South toward secession. At the same time, President Millard Fillmore threatened to use the army to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act in Vermont. No test events took place in Vermont, but the rhetoric of this flare-up echoed South Carolina&#x27;s 1832 nullification crisis and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s 1798 Kentucky Resolutions.

In February 1855, Michigan&#x27;s legislature also passed a law prohibiting county jails from being used to detain recaptured slaves, directing county prosecutors to defend recaptured slaves, and entitling recaptured slaves to &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and trial by jury. Other states to pass personal liberty laws include Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

=== Resistance in the North and other consequences ===
The Fugitive Slave Law brought the issue home to anti-slavery citizens in the North, as it made them and their institutions responsible for enforcing slavery. &quot;Where before many in the North had little or no opinions or feelings on slavery, this law seemed to demand their direct assent to the practice of human bondage, and it galvanized Northern sentiments against slavery.&quot; Moderate abolitionists were faced with the immediate choice of defying what they believed to be an unjust law or breaking with their consciences and beliefs. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852) in response to the law.

Many abolitionists openly defied the law. Reverend Luther Lee, pastor of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Syracuse, New York, wrote in 1855:

Several years before, in the Jerry Rescue, Syracuse abolitionists freed by force a fugitive slave who was to be sent back to the South and successfully smuggled him to Canada. Thomas Sims and Anthony Burns were both captured fugitives who were part of unsuccessful attempts by opponents of the Fugitive Slave Law to use force to free them. Other famous examples include Shadrach Minkins in 1851 and Lucy Bagby in 1861, whose forcible return has been cited by historians as important and &quot;allegorical&quot;. Pittsburgh abolitionists organized groups whose purpose was the seizure and release of any enslaved person passing through the city, as in the case of a free Black servant of the Slaymaker family, erroneously the subject of a rescue by Black waiters in a hotel dining room. If fugitives from slavery were captured and put on trial, abolitionists worked to defend them in trial, and if by chance the recaptured person had their freedom put up for a price, abolitionists worked to pay to free them. Other opponents, such as African-American leader Harriet Tubman, treated the law as just another complication in their activities.

In April 1859, a putative freeman named Daniel Webster was arrested in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, alleged to be Daniel Dangerfield, an escaped slave from Loudoun County, Virginia. At a hearing in Philadelphia, federal commissioner J. Cooke Longstreth ordered Webster&#x27;s release, arguing the claimants had not proved that he was Dangerfield. Webster promptly left for Canada.

===Canada===
One important consequence was that Canada, not the Northern free states, became the foremost destination for escaped slaves. The Black population of Canada increased from 40,000 to 60,000 between 1850 and 1860, and many reached freedom by the Underground Railroad. Notable Black publishers, such as Henry Bibb and Mary Ann Shadd, created publications encouraging emigration to Canada. By 1855, an estimated 3,500 people among Canada&#x27;s Black population were fugitives from American slavery. In Pittsburgh, for example, during the September following the passage of the law, organized groups of escaped slaves, armed and sworn to &quot;die rather than be taken back into slavery&quot;, set out for Canada, with more than 200 men leaving by the end of the month. The Black population in New York City dropped by almost 2,000 from 1850 to 1855.

On the other hand, many Northern businessmen supported the law due to their commercial ties with the Southern states. They founded the Union Safety Committee and raised thousands of dollars to promote their cause, which gained sway, particularly in New York City, and caused public opinion to shift somewhat towards supporting the law.

==End of the Act==

In the early stages of the American Civil War, the Union had no established policy on people escaping from slavery. Many enslaved people left their plantations heading for Union lines. Still, in the early stages of the war, fugitives from slavery were often returned by Union forces to their enslavers. General Benjamin Butler and some other Union generals, however, refused to recapture fugitives under the law because the Union and the Confederacy were at war. He confiscated enslaved people as contraband of war and set them free, with the justification that the loss of labor would also damage the Confederacy. Lincoln allowed Butler to continue his policy but countermanded broader directives issued by other Union commanders that freed all enslaved people in places under their control.

In August 1861, the U.S. Congress enacted the Confiscation Act of 1861, which barred enslavers from re-enslaving captured fugitives who were forced to aid or abet the insurrection. The legislation, sponsored by Lyman Trumbull, was passed on a near-unanimous vote and established military emancipation as official Union policy, but applied only to enslaved people used by rebel enslavers to support the Confederate cause, creating a limited exception to the Fugitive Slave Act. Union Army forces sometimes returned fugitives from slavery to enslavers until March 1862, when Congress enacted the Confiscation Act of 1862, Section 10 of which barred Union officers from returning slaves to their owners on pain of dismissal from the service. James Mitchell Ashley proposed legislation to repeal the Fugitive Slave Act, but the bill did not make it out of committee in 1863. Although the Union policy of confiscation and military emancipation had effectively superseded the operation of the Fugitive Slave Act, the Fugitive Slave Act was only formally repealed in June 1864. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; hailed the repeal, writing: &quot;The blood-red stain that has blotted the statute-book of the Republic is wiped out forever.&quot;

<text>Sean Biggerstaff (born 15 March 1983) is a Scottish actor. He is best known for playing Oliver Wood in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, appearing in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001), &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002), and &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; (2011).

Biggerstaff began acting as a child actor at the age of five and made his screen debut in the television miniseries &quot;The Crow Road&quot; (1996). He won a BAFTA Scotland Award for playing Jeremy Wolfenden in the television film &quot;Consenting Adults&quot; (2007). He also appeared in the feature films &quot;Cashback&quot; (2006) and &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot; (2013).

==Early life==
Biggerstaff was born in Glasgow, Scotland, growing up with his parents in Maryhill. He went to Parkview Primary School in Summerston and joined the local drama group, the Maryhill Youth Theatre, when he was seven.

==Career==
Biggerstaff gained his first professional acting role at ten, playing the son of MacDuff in a Michael Boyd production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow. He then joined the Scottish Youth Theatre and spent six years with the group. In 1996, at the age of 13, Biggerstaff secured his first major TV role, playing Young Darren in the BBC production of &quot;The Crow Road&quot;. At 14, he was cast by future fellow &quot;Harry Potter&quot; actor Alan Rickman in his new movie, &quot;The Winter Guest&quot;, as Tom, a mischievous schoolboy. In a 2002 interview, Biggerstaff recalled: &quot;It was while at the Scottish Youth Theatre that I was chosen for The Winter Guest. Alan Rickman (known to most of the kids as &quot;the bad guy from &quot;Die Hard&quot;&quot;) popped along one day looking for two boys to accompany him to the coldest place on Earth, Fife, for two months to make a film. Myself and the suspicious character that is Douglas Murphy were the lucky ones.&quot;

Rickman later recommended Biggerstaff to the London acting agency International Creative Management and Paul Lyon-Maris. Within a week, the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; castings were being distributed. During auditions, the directors suggested that Biggerstaff consider the part of Oliver Wood, and he played the role in the first two films, returning for a brief appearance in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;.

Biggerstaff&#x27;s career since the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films has included playing Henry, Duke of Gloucester in the 2004 television mini-series &quot;Charles II: The Power and The Passion&quot;; Matt in the world premiere of Sharman MacDonald&#x27;s stage play &quot;The Girl With Red Hair&quot;; and Ben Willis in the short film &quot;Cashback&quot; for which extra scenes were recorded, and the piece was adapted into a feature released in 2006.

In 2007, Biggerstaff played Jeremy Wolfenden in the BBC 4 television film &quot;Consenting Adults&quot; which was nominated for BAFTA Scotland&#x27;s Best Drama Award on 18 November 2007, and won him the BAFTA Scotland&#x27;s Award for Best Actor – Television. He appeared in the film &quot;Hippie Hippie Shake&quot;. and appeared in &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; (2016) directed by Gillies MacKinnon and co-starring Eddie Izzard.

In 2016, Biggerstaff played the lead role in French-Canadian Catherine-Anne Toupin&#x27;s &quot;Right Now&quot;, a translation by Chris Campbell of &quot;À présent&quot;, directed by Michael Boyd, which was critically and commercially well received in Bath, London, and Edinburgh.

In 2017, it was announced that he would star opposite Georgia Tennant in the Big Finish audio series &quot;Jenny: The Doctor&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, taking the role of Noah.
