<text>Plymouth is a ghost town and the &quot;de jure&quot; capital of the island of Montserrat, an overseas territory of the United Kingdom located in the Leeward Island chain of the Lesser Antilles, West Indies. Plymouth is still the &quot;de jure&quot; capital of Montserrat, making it the only ghost town that is the capital of a political territory.

Constructed during the Georgian Era on historical lava deposits near the then long inactive Soufrière Hills volcano, the town was evacuated in 1995 when the volcano resumed erupting. Plymouth was eventually abandoned permanently in 1997 after it was substantially buried by a series of pyroclastic flows and lahars. For centuries, it had been the only port of entry to the island. A new capital is under construction at Little Bay, with nearby Brades serving as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital for the time being.

==History==

===St. Anthony&#x27;s Church===
After the establishment of the first European colony on the island of Montserrat in 1632, St. Anthony&#x27;s Church was established in Plymouth in 1636. Although there is a St. Anthony in Catholicism, it is believed that Governor Anthony Brisket, who went to England to secure funds to build the church, had the church named after himself. The church had to be rebuilt several times throughout its history due to damage from earthquakes and hurricanes. As of September 2021, the church is buried deep in the ash.

===Hurricane Hugo===
Montserrat was struck by Hurricane Hugo on 17 September 1989. The hurricane destroyed a stone jetty in Plymouth&#x27;s harbour. Many other buildings, including schools, health centres, and the recently constructed central hospital building, were rendered unusable by damage from the storm. Given that the hospital was the only one on the island, and damages were extensive enough that all patients had to be relocated, a survey conducted by engineers from the National Emergency Management Agency of Trinidad and Tobago concluded that the hospital should undergo substantial redesign in order to ensure its structural strength could withstand future storms.

===Volcanic eruptions and abandonment===

Beginning on 18 July 1995, a series of huge eruptions at the Soufrière Hills volcano, which had been inactive for centuries, sent ash falls across a wide area of southern Montserrat including the capital, Plymouth. It was soon clear that the town was in grave danger. On 21 August 1995, tephra fell on Plymouth, necessitating an evacuation that lasted until 3 September 1995. Following renewed volcanic activity, on 1 December 1995 residents were evacuated for the second time. This evacuation lasted for one month before residents were allowed back on 1 January 1996.

On 27 March 1996, a series of hot ash emissions and pyroclastic flows began, marking the most dangerous period for the volcano up to that point. Areas nearest the volcano were immediately evacuated; as the volcanic activity continued to escalate, on 3 April 1996, Plymouth was evacuated for the third and final time. The island was divided into risk zones; during some periods, entry into Plymouth was prohibited, and at other times, it was allowed during daytime only to those with a means of rapid escape. The last time that access was legally allowed to Plymouth during daytime was 16 June 1997, with the exception of essential services. On 25 June 1997, a further massive eruption produced pyroclastic surges that killed 19 people and reached nearly to the island&#x27;s airport on the eastern side of the island, which had remained open until that time.

Between 4–8 August 1997, a further series of large eruptions destroyed approximately 80% of the town, burying it under of ash. This hot material burned many of the buildings, making habitation nearly impossible for many of the residents.

The pyroclastic flows, lava, ash and other volcanic rock types were mostly compact, having a density similar to that of concrete. The removal of the overburden would have required the use of explosives, bulldozers and other resources too expensive for widespread use. It was anticipated that the soil underneath the hardened mud and lava would have been scorched and left completely non-arable by the intense heat of the pyroclastic flows.

The government ordered the evacuation of Plymouth, with the Royal Navy assisting by taking the population to safety. The entire southern half of the island was declared an exclusion zone because of the continuing volcanic activity at the Soufrière Hills. The government of the island was moved north to the town of Brades, although Plymouth remains the &quot;de jure&quot; capital. , a new port and capital are under construction at Little Bay, on the island&#x27;s northwest coast. Daytime access to Plymouth has been permitted for some activities since about 2015, including sand and gravel extraction for construction projects.

The total destruction of Plymouth caused severe economic problems for the island of Montserrat. Plymouth had been by far the largest settlement on the island, with a population of around 4,000 inhabitants, and as such had been the site of almost all the island&#x27;s shops and services, in addition to having been its seat of government. 

Some of the lost facilities were subsequently rebuilt elsewhere on Montserrat, but this did not prevent emigration. Between 1995 and 2000, two-thirds of the island&#x27;s total population was forced to flee, many of whom settled in the United Kingdom, leaving fewer than 1,200 people resident on the island as of 1997. The population figure had risen to nearly 5,000 by 2016.

==Geography==
Plymouth is situated on the lower southwest slope of the Soufrière Hills Volcano. It is well within the volcanic exclusion zone, which is considered wholly uninhabitable.
===Climate===
==Transport==
The airport serving the island of Montserrat, W. H. Bramble Airport, was shut down completely by 1997 and subsequently destroyed as it was buried in volcanic ash. A new airport, John A. Osborne Airport, opened in 2005 at Gerald&#x27;s, near Brades in the north of the island.

==Education==

In the pre-1997 period, it was served by Plymouth Primary School, and Plymouth Junior Secondary School.

<text>Gotska Sandön (literally translated as &quot;The Gotlandic Sand Island&quot;) is an uninhabited Swedish island north of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. It has been a national park since 1909.

== Geography ==
Gotska Sandön is situated north of Fårö in the Baltic Sea. Legally a part of Gotland province, it is approximately long and wide, with a total area of approximately . The island is part of Fårö socken (not to be confused with parish). It comprises the same area as the administrative Fårö District, established on 1January 2016.

On the northwest tip of the island is a church, Gotska Sandön Chapel. , Gotska Sandön Chapel along with Fårö Church belong to Fårö parish in Norra Gotlands pastorat.

During the summer, there are regular boat tours from Fårö Island and Nynäshamn on the mainland.

== Nature of Gotska Sandön ==
The island consists mostly of sand and is dominated by beaches, dunes and especially pine forests. Aside from a colony of grey seals, the higher fauna is not very rich. Terrestrial or aerial mammals include mountain hares and bats. However, the island is home to many rare insects and plants, including the Kashubian vetch and several species of orchid.

== Climate ==
Despite its isolation from sizeable landmasses, Gotska Sandön&#x27;s oceanic climate is warm for its latitude. The Scandinavian Peninsula to the west, Gotland to the south and the Baltic landmass to the east contribute to warmer summers and frequent winter frost, giving the island a far broader temperature range than, for example, the similarly isolated Fair Isle, which lies one degree further north some distance off the coast of Scotland. In spite of this range, summer highs are cool by the standards of southern Sweden, and winter nights are among the mildest in the country.

Gotska Sandön has significant seasonal lag: despite dwindling daylight hours, August is much warmer than June, while March days are both longer and colder than those in December.

<doc id="376919" wikidata="Q6769824" url="?curid=376919" title="Mark Steel">
<text>Mark Steel (born 4 July 1960) is an English author, broadcaster, stand-up comedian and newspaper columnist. He has made many appearances on radio and television shows as a guest panellist, and has written regular columns in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. He presents &quot;The Mark Steel Lectures&quot;, &quot;The Mark Steel Solution&quot;, &quot;Mark Steel&#x27;s in Town&quot; and the podcast &quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot;

==Early life==
Steel was adopted 10 days after he was born. His adoptive father worked in insurance and his mother was a housewife who supplemented the family&#x27;s income through factory work and working as a lollipop lady. He had a close relationship with his adoptive parents. Steel told &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;:

He grew up in Swanley, Kent, and claims he was expelled from school for attending a cricket course without permission: &quot;I thought, fantastic! The punishment for not coming in is that I&#x27;m not allowed to come in.&quot; He traced his biological mother later in life but she said that she did not want to know him, and died soon after. He learned that she was from a Scottish working-class family with an active involvement in left-wing politics; she had married an Italian and lived in Rimini. She had met his biological father Joe Dwek at a party in London. Dwek was an Egyptian Sephardic Jew whose family left Egypt after Gamal Abdel Nasser became president in the 1950s. Dwek had subsequently become a multi-millionaire trader on Wall Street as well as a professional backgammon player who won tournaments in the USA and Europe, and represented the UK against the USA in 1973 and 1974. After writing and emailing, Steel met Dwek only once, in a London restaurant sometime around 2006. In 2015, Steel told &quot;The Guardian&quot;:


In the late 1970s his adoptive father suffered a mental breakdown and was placed into care at Stone House Hospital. Steel says that his first encounter with social injustice was when he saw how mentally ill patients were being treated in that hospital. The shabby conditions reinforced Steel&#x27;s political beliefs.

Steel documented his early life, adoption and quest to find his birth parents in an audio book for Audible Productions &quot;Who Do I Think I Am?&quot; – which was released in December 2021.

==Career==
Steel had various early jobs including a stint as a milkman. He became bored with answering how he started in comedy and took to saying the first thing that came into his head. He worked the comedy circuit for several years, and acknowledges Alexei Sayle as an influence. In 1992 Steel presented the satirical radio show &quot;The Mark Steel Solution&quot; on BBC Radio 5, consisting of half-hour monologues offering solutions to social problems. It ran to four series. A comic autobiography, &quot;It&#x27;s Not a Runner Bean&quot;, was published in 1996 which led to a column in &quot;The Guardian&quot; between 1996 and 1999. In 2000 he started writing the Thursday Opinion Column for &quot;The Independent&quot;.

He has appeared frequently on &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;, &quot;Room 101&quot;, &quot;Mock the Week&quot;, &quot;the Graham Norton Show&quot;, and has made several appearances on &quot;Question Time&quot;. &quot;Mark Steel&#x27;s in Town&quot; has won a Sony Award, Writers&#x27; Guild Award, Chortle Awards and British Comedy Guide Awards. In 2014 he won the British Press Award for Broadsheet Columnist for his column in &quot;The Independent&quot;.

He has written and performed several radio and television series for the BBC, and written several books including his autobiography &quot;Reasons to Be Cheerful&quot;, &quot;Vive la Révolution&quot; – an account of the French Revolution, and &quot;It&#x27;s Not a Runner Bean&quot;.

In 2015 he toured a show &quot;Who Do I Think I Am&quot;, about his adoption and tracing his biological parents. It was broadcast as a show on Radio 4.

In 2017, Steel was back on stage with his show &quot;Every Little Thing&#x27;s Gonna Be Alright&quot;.

==Personal life==
He has a son, Elliot Steel, who is also a stand-up comedian, and a daughter from a relationship that ended in 2006. He was married to Natasha Steel until 2016. In 2022 he was in a relationship with fellow comedian Shaparak Khorsandi and has described their relationship as &quot;always entwined&quot;.

In October 2023, Steel said that he was undergoing surgery after a diagnosis of throat cancer.

During the South Africa series in 2008 he was interviewed by Jonathan Agnew on &quot;Test Match Special&quot; about his love of cricket.

In December 2024, Steel was the castaway for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His musical choices included &quot;Janie Jones&quot; by The Clash, &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot; by Millie Small and &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; by Rage Against the Machine. He also chose the Nick Cave song &quot;Into My Arms&quot; and dedicated it to Khorsandi. His favourite track was &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; by Nina Simone.

==Politics==
During the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, when he was in his 20s, Steel vented his objections to society&#x27;s injustices via political protests, punk rock, and poetry.

Viewing the Soviet Union as &quot;shit&quot;, and as a state capitalist system rather than truly socialist, Steel joined the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). He was present in Southall in 1979 during the riot in which Blair Peach was killed.

In 2000, Steel took part in the London Assembly elections on behalf of the London Socialist Alliance (part of the Socialist Alliance) in the Croydon and Sutton constituency; he received 1,823 votes (1.5% of the vote).

At the 2010 UK General Election Steel co-hosted a fundraiser entitled &quot;Laugh! I nearly voted&quot; with Joe Lycett, Lewis Costello and Matt Green in support of left-wing candidates at the Dancehouse theatre in Manchester. Proceeds went to the respective campaigns of Gayle O&#x27;Donovan of the Green Party of England and Wales in Manchester Central, David Joseph Henry, the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition candidate for Salford and Eccles and Kay Philips of the Respect Party in Blackley and Broughton.

In February 2013, Steel was among those who supported the People&#x27;s Assembly in a letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He spoke at a press conference to launch the People&#x27;s Assembly Against Austerity on 26 March 2013, and at regional public meetings in the lead up to a national meeting at Westminster Central Hall on 22 June 2013. He also gave a speech at the People&#x27;s Assembly Conference in Westminster.

Prior to the 2015 UK general election, he endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party&#x27;s Caroline Lucas.

<text>Bandini (translation: &quot;Imprisoned&quot;) is a 1963 Hindi drama film directed and produced by Bimal Roy.It stars Nutan, Ashok Kumar and Dharmendra. The film tells the story of a woman prisoner serving life imprisonment for murder, Kalyani, the all suffering, selfless, sacrificing and strong, yet weak Indian woman. She must make a choice between two very different men, Devendra (Dharmendra), the loving prison doctor, and Bikash (Ashok Kumar), a man from her past.

The film is based on the Bengali novel &quot;Tamasi&quot; by Jarasandha (Charu Chandra Chakrabarti), a former jail superintendent who spent much of his career as a jailor in Northern Bengal, and wrote many fictional versions of his experiences.

Bandini was the tenth highest grosser of the year and was declared a &#x27;Semi Hit&#x27; by Box Office India. It received critical acclaim and swept that year&#x27;s Filmfare Awards, winning six awards in all, including the top awards of Best Film and Best Director, as well as Best Actress, and is still considered a landmark movie of the 1960s, especially being the last feature film of the director Bimal Roy.

== Plot ==
The film is set in a prison in around 1934 in pre-Independence India, where Kalyani is serving life imprisonment prison for committing a murder, and we learn the circumstances of her crime in a series of flashbacks as she divulges it to the jailor. The film is set in Bengal in the 1930s, during the British Raj, where Kalyani is the daughter of the postmaster of the village, who falls in love with a freedom fighter, Bikash, who later leaves her in the village promising to come back but never does. Society treats them harshly. Broken by her father&#x27;s misery and that of her own, Kalyani moves to the city, while the song &quot;O Jaanewale Ho Sake To Laut Ke Aana&quot; plays. In the city, she works as a caretaker of an obnoxious and mentally unstable woman, who turns out to be the wife of Bikash. Kalyani learns that her father came to the city looking for her and died in an accident. This prompts her to poison her lover&#x27;s wife, identifying her as the cause of her miseries in a moment of insane rage.

Back from the flashback in the jail, Deven, the jail doctor falls in love with her. Kalyani is not ready for it and starts to stay away from him. They are always shown with a partition in between after Deven proposes her. Another symbolism used in the movie is the occasional shouting of &quot;All is well&quot; by the prison guard when nothing in the movie is; and just as Kalyani is leaving prison for good, she receives yet another ironic message from a jail official, &quot;Ab ghar grihasthi ki jail mein qaid rahogi!&quot; (Now you will be imprisoned in the jail of household!) In the end, she finds Bikash at a ship harbour where she finds him in an ill condition. She then decides to take care of Bikash and her love is again reborn.

== Production ==
;Writing
The screenplay of the film was written by Nabendu Ghosh, who had previously done the Bimal Roy films &quot;Devdas&quot; (1955) and &quot;Sujata&quot; (1959). It was based on the story &quot;Tamasi&quot; by Jarasandha, pen name of Charu Chandra Chakraborty, a former jail superintendent who wrote many stories based on his career as a jailor in Northern Bengal, including many fictional versions of his experiences, &quot;Louha-Kapat&quot; (1953), &quot;Tamasha&quot; (1958) and &quot;Nyaydanda&quot; (1961), effective creating a new genre in Bengali literature of prison stories.

The principal photography of the film took place at Mohan Studios in Mumbai, with some parts in Naini Central Jail, Yerwada Central Jail and Bhagalpur Central Jail, and the climax scene on the banks of the Ganga River at Sahibganj, in present Jharkhand.

== Music ==
The soundtrack includes the following tracks, composed by S. D. Burman, with lyrics by Shailendra. The film also marks the debut of Gulzar, who was working as an assistant director on the film as a film lyricist, initially having refused Bimal Roy on the offering, saying that he didn&#x27;t want to become a lyricist, Gulzar relented only after the film&#x27;s music director S.D. Burman convinced him so, and he wrote the song &quot;Mora Gora Ang Lai Le&quot;, sung by Lata, in five days. The rest of lyrics are by Shailendra, who gave classics like the haunting &quot;Mere Sajan Hain Us Paar&quot; in the bardic voice of S.D. Burman himself, Mukesh&#x27;s sad song &quot;O Jaanewale Ho Sake&quot;, where Burman uses &quot;Bhatiyali&quot; with a variation.

The songs depict the situation, like a prisoner singing an ode to an imprisoned bird, &quot;O Panchhi Pyare&quot;, sung by Asha Bhosle and Asha Bhosle&#x27;s &quot;Ab ke Baras Bhej Bhaiya ko Babul&quot; composed in Raga Pilu, uses the folk idiom of a traditional song of a newly married girl longing for her maternal home, (&quot;maika&quot;), but being sung by a prison inmate of Kalyani, immediately conveys the irony in its placement.

<doc id="376924" wikidata="Q5130989" url="?curid=376924" title="Cleavage furrow">
<text>In cell biology, the cleavage furrow is the indentation of the cell&#x27;s surface that begins the progression of cleavage, by which animal and some algal cells undergo cytokinesis, the final splitting of the membrane, in the process of cell division. The same proteins responsible for muscle contraction, actin and myosin, begin the process of forming the cleavage furrow, creating an actomyosin ring. Other cytoskeletal proteins and actin binding proteins are involved in the procedure.

== Mechanism ==
Plant cells do not perform cytokinesis through this exact method but the two procedures are not totally different. Animal cells form an actin-myosin contractile ring within the equatorial region of the cell membrane that constricts to form the cleavage furrow. In plant cells, Golgi vesicle secretions form a cell plate or septum on the equatorial plane of the cell wall by the action of microtubules of the phragmoplast. The cleavage furrow in animal cells and the phragmoplast in plant cells are complex structures made up of microtubules and microfilaments that aide in the final separation of the cells into two identical daughter cells.

== Cell cycle ==
The cell cycle begins with interphase when the DNA replicates, the cell grows and prepares to enter mitosis. Mitosis includes four phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Prophase is the initial phase when spindle fibers appear that function to move the chromosomes toward opposite poles. This spindle apparatus consists of microtubules, microfilaments and a complex network of various proteins. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up using the spindle apparatus in the middle of the cell along the equatorial plate. The chromosomes move to opposite poles during anaphase and remain attached to the spindle fibers by their centromeres. Animal cell cleavage furrow formation is caused by a ring of actin microfilaments called the contractile ring, which forms during early anaphase. Myosin is present in the region of the contractile ring as concentrated microfilaments and actin filaments are predominant in this region. The actin filaments here are both pre-existing and new. Cleavage is driven by these motor proteins, actin and myosin, which are the same proteins involved with muscle contraction. During cellular cleavage, the contractile ring tightens around the cytoplasm of the cell until the cytoplasm is pinched into two daughter cells. During the final phase of mitosis, telophase, the furrow forms an intercellular bridge using mitotic spindle fibers. Phosphatidylethanolamine has been shown to be present during this time, which indicates that it may play a role in movement between the plasma membrane and contractile ring. The bridge is then broken and resealed to form two identical daughter cells during cytokinesis. The breakage is formed by microtubules and the resealing is negated by calcium dependent exocytosis using Golgi vesicles. In comparison, the plant cell septum and the animal cell mid-zone are analogous. Both require vesicular secretions by the Golgi apparatus for resealing and formation of the cytoskeletal network, in addition to microtubules and microfilaments for division and movement. The cleavage furrow mechanism in animal cells is a complex network of actin and myosin filaments, Golgi vesicles and calcium dependent channels enabling the cell to break apart, reseal and form new daughter cells with complete membranes.

<doc id="376929" wikidata="Q252739" url="?curid=376929" title="Lewis F. Powell Jr.">
<text>Lewis Franklin Powell Jr. (September 19, 1907 – August 25, 1998) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1972 to 1987.

Born in Suffolk, Virginia, he graduated from both the Washington and Lee University School of Law and Harvard Law School and served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. He worked for Hunton &amp; Williams, a large law firm in Richmond, Virginia, focusing on corporate law and representing clients such as the Tobacco Institute. His 1971 Powell Memorandum became the blueprint for the rise of the American conservative movement and the formation of a network of influential right-wing think tanks and lobbying organizations, such as The Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council. In 1971, President Richard Nixon appointed Powell to succeed the late Associate Justice Hugo Black. He retired from the Court during the administration of President Ronald Reagan, and was eventually succeeded by Anthony Kennedy.

His tenure largely overlapped with that of Chief Justice Warren Burger, and Powell was often a key swing vote on the Burger Court. His majority opinions include &quot;United States v. Brignoni-Ponce&quot; (1975), &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; (1976), &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot; (1978), &quot;Solem v. Helm&quot; (1983), and &quot;McCleskey v. Kemp&quot; (1987), and he wrote an influential opinion in &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot; (1978). He notably joined the majority in controversial cases such as &quot;United States v. United States District Court&quot; (1972), &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973), &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; (1974), &quot;Harris v. McRae&quot; (1980), &quot;Plyler v. Doe&quot; (1982), and &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; (1986).

== Early life and education ==
Powell was born in Suffolk, Virginia in 1907, the son of Mary Lewis (Gwathmey) and Louis Franklin Powell. Powell set out to attend Washington and Lee University where he became president of his fraternity, managing editor of the student newspaper, and a member of the yearbook staff. His major was in commerce, but he also studied law. Powell had always planned on becoming a lawyer because he viewed their roles as shaping history. He graduated in 1929 with a B.A. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa. He also was named recipient of the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award for &quot;generous service to others&quot;.

Powell then attended Washington and Lee University School of Law and in 1931 graduated valedictorian. He received a Master of Laws degree from Harvard Law School in 1932, wrote a LL.M. thesis entitled &quot;Relation between the Virginia Court of Appeals and the State Corporation Commission&quot;, and was one of two U.S. Supreme Court justices to have earned an LL.M. degree.

He was elected president of the student body as an undergraduate with the help of Mosby Perrow Jr., and the two served together on the Virginia State Board of Education in the 1960s. Powell was a member of Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity and the Sigma Society. At a leadership conference, he met Edward R. Murrow, and they became close friends.

In 1936, he married Josephine Pierce Rucker with whom he had three daughters and one son. She died in 1996.

==Career==
===Military service, 1939–1945===
During World War II, he first tried to join the United States Navy but was rejected because of poor eyesight, so he joined the US Army Air Forces as an Intelligence officer. After receiving his commission as a first lieutenant in 1942, he completed training at bases near Miami, Florida and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He was assigned to the 319th Bombardment Group, which moved to England later that year. He served in North Africa during Operation Torch and was later assigned to the Headquarters of the Northwest African Air Forces. There, Powell served in Sicily during the Allied invasion of Sicily.

In August 1943, he was assigned to the Intelligence staff of the Army Air Forces in Washington, D.C. Slated for assignment as an instructor at the facility near Harrisburg, he worked instead on several special projects for the AAF headquarters until February 1944. He was then assigned to the Intelligence staff of the Department of War and then the Intelligence staff of United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe. While there Colonel Powell wrote in the aftermath of the 13–15 February 1945 Bombing of Dresden that &quot;Personally, I consider this very fortunate indeed as the German people are being taught for the first time in modern history what it means to have war on their own soil.&quot;

Powell was assigned to the Ultra project, as one of the officers designated to monitor the use of intercepted Axis communications. He worked in England and in the Mediterranean Theater and ensured that the use of Ultra information was in compliance with the laws of war, and that the use of such information did not reveal the source, which would have alerted that the code had been broken.

Powell advanced through the ranks to colonel, and received the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal, and French Croix de Guerre with bronze palm. He was discharged in October 1945.

===Legal career===
In 1941, Powell served as Chairman of the American Bar Association&#x27;s Young Lawyers Division.

Powell was a partner for more than a quarter of a century at Hunton, Williams, Gay, Powell and Gibson, a large white shoe Virginia law firm, with its primary office in Richmond, now known as Hunton Andrews Kurth. Powell practiced primarily in the areas of corporate law, especially in the fields of business acquisitions, securities regulation, bankruptcy, real estate and railroad litigation.

From 1961 to 1962 Powell served as Chair of the American Bar Association&#x27;s Standing Committee on the Economics of Law Practice, which later evolved into the ABA Law Practice Division. During his tenure as chair of the committee, &quot;The Lawyers Handbook&quot; was first published and distributed to all attorneys who joined the ABA that year. In its preface, Powell wrote, &quot;The basic concept of freedom under law, which underlies our entire structure of government, can only be sustained by a strong and independent bar. It is plainly in the public interest that the economic health of the legal profession be safeguarded. One of the means toward this end is to improve the efficiency and productivity of lawyers.&quot;

From 1964 to 1965 he was elected President of the ABA. Powell led the way in attempting to provide legal services to the poor, and he made a key decision to cooperate with the federal government&#x27;s Legal Services Corporation. Powell was also involved in the development of Colonial Williamsburg, where he was both a trustee and general counsel.
From 1964 until his court appointment in 1971 he was a board member of Philip Morris
and acted as a contact point for the tobacco industry with Virginia Commonwealth University. Through his law firm, Powell represented the Tobacco Institute and various tobacco companies in numerous cases.

=== Virginia government, 1951–1970 ===
Powell played an important role in local community affairs. From 1951 to 1961, he served on the Richmond School Board and was its chairman from 1952 to 1961. Powell presided over the school board at a time when the Commonwealth of Virginia was locked in a campaign of defiance against the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), which desegregated public schools. Powell&#x27;s law firm, although not Powell himself, represented one of the defendant school districts in &quot;Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot;, which was consolidated later into &quot;Brown&quot;.

The Richmond School Board had no authority at the time to force integration, however, as control over attendance policies had been transferred to the state government. Powell, like most white Southern leaders of his day, did not speak out against the state&#x27;s defiance, but he fostered close working relationships with many black leaders, such as civil rights lawyer Oliver Hill, some of whom offered key support for Powell&#x27;s Supreme Court nomination. In 1990, Powell swore in Virginia&#x27;s first black governor, Douglas Wilder.

From 1961 to 1969, Powell served on the Virginia Board of Education; he was chairman from 1968 to 1969.

=== Powell Memorandum, 1971 ===

&lt;section begin=&quot;Powell Memorandum&quot; /&gt;On August 23, 1971, prior to accepting Nixon&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court, Powell was commissioned by his neighbor Eugene B. Sydnor Jr., a close friend and education director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to write a confidential memorandum for the chamber entitled &quot;Attack on the American Free Enterprise System,&quot; an anti-Communist and anti-New Deal blueprint for conservative business interests to retake America. It was based in part on Powell&#x27;s reaction to the work of activist Ralph Nader, whose 1965 exposé on General Motors, &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;, put a focus on the auto industry putting profit ahead of safety, which triggered the American consumer movement. Powell saw it as an undermining of the power of private business and a step toward socialism. His experiences as a corporate lawyer and a director on the board of Phillip Morris from 1964 until his appointment to the Supreme Court made him a champion of the tobacco industry who railed against the growing scientific evidence linking smoking to cancer deaths. He argued, unsuccessfully, that tobacco companies&#x27; First Amendment rights were being infringed when news organizations were not giving credence to the cancer denials of the industry.

The memo called for corporate America to become more aggressive in molding society&#x27;s thinking about business, government, politics and law in the U.S. It inspired wealthy heirs of earlier American industrialists, the Earhart Foundation (whose money came from an oil fortune), and the Smith Richardson Foundation (from the cough medicine dynasty) to use their private charitable foundations, which did not have to report their political activities, to join the Carthage Foundation, founded by Richard Mellon Scaife in 1964. The Carthage Foundation pursued Powell&#x27;s vision of a pro-business, anti-socialist, minimally government-regulated America based on what he thought America had been in the heyday of early American industrialism, before the Great Depression and the rise of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal.

The Powell Memorandum ultimately came to be a blueprint for the rise of the American conservative movement and the formation of a network of influential right-wing think tanks and lobbying organizations, such as the Business Roundtable, The Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, Manhattan Institute for Policy Research and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and inspired the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to become far more politically active. CUNY professor David Harvey traces the rise of neoliberalism in the US to this memo. Historian Gary Gerstle refers to the memo as &quot;a neoliberal call to arms.&quot; Political scientist Aaron Good describes it as an &quot;inverted totalitarian manifesto&quot; designed to identify threats to the established economic order following the democratic upsurge of the 1960s.

Powell argued, &quot;The most disquieting voices joining the chorus of criticism came from perfectly respectable elements of society: from the college campus, the pulpit, the media, the intellectual and literary journals, the arts and sciences, and from politicians.&quot; In the memorandum, Powell advocated &quot;constant surveillance&quot; of textbook and television content, as well as a purge of left-wing elements. He named consumer advocate Nader as the chief antagonist of American business. Powell urged conservatives to undertake a sustained media-outreach program, including funding neoliberal scholars, publishing books, papers, popular magazines, and scholarly journals, and influencing public opinion.

This memo foreshadowed a number of Powell&#x27;s court opinions, especially &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot;, which shifted the direction of First Amendment law by declaring that corporate financial influence of elections by independent expenditures should be protected with the same vigor as individual political speech. Much of the future Court opinion in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; relied on the same arguments raised in &quot;Bellotti&quot;.

Although written confidentially for Sydnor at the Chamber of Commerce, it was discovered by Jack Anderson, a columnist with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who reported on its content a year later, after Powell had joined the Supreme Court. Anderson alleged that Powell was trying to undermine the democratic system; however, in terms of business&#x27;s view of itself in relation to government and public interest groups, the memo could be alternatively read to simply convey conventional thinking among businessmen at the time. The explicit goal of the memo was not to destroy democracy, though its emphasis on political institution-building as a concentration of big business power, particularly updating the Chamber&#x27;s efforts to influence federal policy, has reportedly had that effect. Here, it was a major force in motivating the Chamber and other groups to modernize their efforts to lobby the federal government. Following the memo&#x27;s directives, conservative foundations greatly increased, pouring money into think-tanks. This rise of conservative lobbying led to the conservative intellectual movement and its increasing influence over mainstream political discourse, starting in the 1970s and 1980s, and due chiefly to the works of the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation.

During the 2024 presidential election season, the Powell memo was called out as the basis for the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s audacious and wide-reaching Project 2025 agenda for their hoped-for next Republican administration.&lt;section end=&quot;Powell Memorandum&quot; /&gt;

=== Supreme Court tenure, 1972–1987 ===
In 1969, Nixon asked him to join the Supreme Court following the resignation of Abe Fortas, but Powell turned him down, and Judge Harry Blackmun of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals was appointed instead (following Senate rejections of Judges Clement F. Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell). In 1971, Nixon asked him again. Powell was unsure, but Nixon and his Attorney General, John N. Mitchell, persuaded him that joining the Court was his duty to the nation. One of the primary concerns that Powell had was the effect leaving his law firm and joining the high court would have on his personal financial status, as he enjoyed a very lucrative private practice at his law firm. Another of Powell&#x27;s major concerns was that as a corporate attorney, he would be unfamiliar with many of the issues that would come before the Supreme Court, which, as now, heard very few corporate law cases. Powell feared that would place him at a disadvantage and make it unlikely that he would be able to influence his colleagues.

Nixon nominated Powell and William Rehnquist to the Court on the same day, October 21, 1971. Powell&#x27;s nomination generated no controversy and he took over the seat of Hugo Black after being confirmed by the Senate 89–1 on December 6, 1971 (the lone &quot;nay&quot; came from Oklahoma Democrat Fred R. Harris). On the day of Powell&#x27;s swearing-in, when Rehnquist&#x27;s wife Nan asked Josephine Powell if this was the most exciting day of her life, Josephine said, &quot;No, it is the worst day of my life. I am about to cry.&quot;

Lewis Powell served from January 7, 1972, until June 26, 1987, when he retired from the Court.

Powell voted with the 7–2 majority who legalized abortion in the United States in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973). Powell&#x27;s pro-choice stance on abortion stemmed from an incident during his tenure at his Richmond law firm, when the girlfriend of one of Powell&#x27;s office staff bled to death from an illegal self-induced abortion.

Powell, who dissented in the case of &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; (1972), striking down capital punishment statutes, was a key mover behind the Court&#x27;s compromise opinion in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; (1976), which allowed the return of capital punishment but only with strengthened procedural safeguards. In &quot;Coker v. Georgia&quot; (1977), in which the Court held that the death penalty was an unconstitutionally disproportionate punishment for the rape of an adult woman, a convicted murderer escaped from prison and, in the course of committing an armed robbery and other offenses, raped an adult woman. The State of Georgia sentenced the rapist to death. Justice Powell, acknowledging that the woman had been raped, expressed the view that &quot;the victim [did not] sustain serious or lasting injury&quot; and voted to set the death penalty aside. In that same case, Powell also wrote to rebuke the plurality&#x27;s statement that &quot;for the rape victim, life may not be nearly so happy as it was, but it is not over and normally is not beyond repair,&quot; instead stating that &quot;[s]ome victims are so grievously injured physically or psychologically that life is beyond repair.&quot;

He joined the majority opinion in &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; (1974), which struck down a school busing plan which was designed to racially integrate 53 Detroit area public school districts across district lines. They had inadvertently become segregated due to white flight to the suburbs. The majority ruled against the busing because the schools hadn&#x27;t been segregated by law.

His plurality opinion in &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot; (1978), joined by no other justice in full, represented a compromise between the opinions of Justice William J. Brennan, who, joined by three other progressive justices, would have upheld affirmative action programs under a lenient judicial test, and the opinion of John Paul Stevens, joined by three other justices, who would have struck down the university&#x27;s use of racial quotas at issue in the case under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Powell&#x27;s opinion striking down the law urged &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; to be applied to affirmative action programs but hinted that some affirmative action programs might pass Constitutional muster.

Powell wrote the majority opinion in &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot; (1978), which overturned a Massachusetts law restricting corporate contributions to referendum campaigns not directly related to their business.

In spite of supporting legal abortion, Powell ruled with the majority in &quot;Harris v. McRae&quot; (1980), which held that states participating in Medicaid are not required to fund medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement was not available after the Hyde Amendment restricted the use of federal funds for abortion. The Court also held that the funding restrictions of the Hyde Amendment did not violate the Fifth Amendment or the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

In the controversial case of &quot;Snepp v. U.S.&quot; (1980), the Court issued a per curiam upholding the lower court&#x27;s imposition of a constructive trust upon former CIA agent Frank Snepp and its requirement for preclearance of all his published writings with the CIA for the rest of his life. In 1997, Snepp gained access to the files of Justices Thurgood Marshall (who had already died) and William J. Brennan Jr. (who voluntarily granted Snepp access) and confirmed his suspicion that Powell had been the author of the per curiam opinion. Snepp later pointed out that Powell had misstated the factual record and had not reviewed the actual case file (Powell was in the habit of writing opinions based on the briefs alone) and that the only justice who even looked at the case file was John Paul Stevens, who relied upon it in composing his dissent. From his days in counterintelligence during World War II, Powell believed in the need for government secrecy and urged the same position on his colleagues during the Court&#x27;s consideration of 1974&#x27;s &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot;.

In 1982, Powell joined the 5–4 majority opinion in &quot;Plyler v. Doe&quot; holding that a Texas law forbidding illegal immigrant children from public education was unconstitutional. Powell had a mixed record in deciding cases, but joined the Court&#x27;s four liberal Justices to declare the law unconstitutional.

Powell was the deciding vote in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;, , in which the Court upheld Georgia&#x27;s sodomy laws. He was reportedly conflicted over how to vote. A conservative clerk, Michael W. Mosman, advised him to uphold the ban, and Powell, who believed he had never met a gay person, not realizing that one of his own clerks was a closeted homosexual, voted to uphold Georgia&#x27;s sodomy law. However, he, in a concurring opinion, expressed concern at the length of the prison terms prescribed by the law, criticizing them as excessive. The Court, 17 years later, expressly overruled &quot;Bowers&quot; in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, . In 1990, after his retirement from the Court, he said, &quot;I think I made a mistake in the Hardwick case,&quot; marking one of the few times a justice expressed regret for one of his previous rulings. Scholars would later conclude that Powell unknowingly hired more gay clerks than any other Justice. Paul M. Smith, the gay attorney who argued in favor of overturning &quot;Bowers&quot;, is a former clerk for Justice Powell.

Powell also expressed post-retirement regret over his majority opinion in &quot;McCleskey v. Kemp&quot; (1987), where he voted to uphold the death penalty against a study that demonstrated that, except as punishment for the most violent of crimes, murderers sentenced for killing white victims were up to forty times more likely to receive the death penalty than people who killed black victims. In an interview with his biographer, he stated that he no longer supported the death penalty.

== Retirement and death==
Powell was nearly 80 years old when he retired from his position as Supreme Court justice in June 1987. His career on the bench was described by Gerald Gunther, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford Law School, as &quot;truly distinguished&quot; because of his &quot;qualities of temperament and character,&quot; which &quot;made it possible for him, more than any contemporary, to perform his tasks in accordance with the modest, restrained, yet creative model of judging.&quot;

He was succeeded by Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy was the third nominee for his position. The first, Robert Bork, was rejected by the United States Senate after a bitter confirmation fight. The second, Douglas H. Ginsburg, withdrew his name from consideration after admitting to having smoked marijuana both as a college undergraduate and with his students while a law professor.

Following his retirement from the high court, he sat regularly on various United States Courts of Appeals around the country.

In 1990, Douglas Wilder asked Powell to swear him in as governor of Virginia, and the first elected African-American governor in the United States.

Powell died at his home in the Windsor Farms area of Richmond, Virginia, of pneumonia, at 4:30 in the morning of August 25, 1998, at the age of 90. He is buried in Richmond&#x27;s Hollywood Cemetery.

==Legacy==

In her 2002 book, &quot;The Majesty of the Law&quot;, Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor wrote, &quot;For those who seek a model of human kindness, decency, exemplary behavior, and integrity, there will never be a better man.&quot;

Powell&#x27;s personal and official papers were donated to his alma mater, Washington and Lee University School of Law, where they are open for research, subject to certain restrictions. A wing at Sydney Lewis Hall, home of W&amp;L Law, which houses his papers, is named for him.

J. Harvie Wilkinson, a judge on the Fourth Circuit, and former law clerk for Justice Powell, wrote a book titled &quot;Serving Justice: A Supreme Court Clerk&#x27;s View&quot; describing the experience.

In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed into law an act of Congress renaming the Federal courthouse at Richmond, Virginia, in his honor, the Lewis F. Powell Jr. United States Courthouse.

<text>James Alan Hydrick (born February 28, 1959) is an American former stage performer and self-described psychic.

Hydrick claimed to be able to perform acts of telekinesis, such as his trademark trick of moving a pencil resting at the edge of a table. Following a nationally televised demonstration of his abilities on &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot;, he was unable to prove his supernatural abilities on &quot;That&#x27;s My Line&quot;, and later confessed the fraud.

Hydrick had a long history of criminal offenses and was imprisoned at least three times, after which he escaped; his final offense was for child molestation in 1989, for which he remains in a psychiatric hospital.

==Early life==
Hydrick was born in South Carolina to 36-year-old father Billy Hydrick and 13-year-old mother Lois Hydrick. His father was allegedly abusive. In 1989, he told an interviewer that he started learning karate at age six to protect himself from his father after seeing one of his brothers beaten to death. He and his other siblings later lived in a series of foster homes and orphanages.

Hydrick was convicted of kidnapping and torture in 1977, for which he was imprisoned. He escaped three times: he allegedly kicked through a concrete wall in a Georgia jail, broke through gates at a South Carolina prison, and finally, in 1982, he pole-vaulted over a fence at a state prison in Utah.

==Rise to fame==
Throughout the 1970s, Hydrick was arrested repeatedly for crimes ranging from burglary to assault. Despite his difficult background and ongoing legal troubles, Hydrick gained prominence for his karate and sleight of hand tricks, earning national television exposure and a cult following. He claimed he was able to use psychokinesis to turn the pages of books and make pencils spin around on desks, among other feats. Hydrick also set up martial arts classes and claimed he could pass on the gift of psychokinesis to children through special training techniques, which was shown in 1989 to be a front for his coercing children into performing sexual favors for him, and was a factor in his conviction for sexual assault of a minor.

Hydrick&#x27;s most visible demonstration of his purported skills was in an episode of the series &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot; that originally aired in December 1980 and repeated in 1981. He performed the pencil-spinning trick with the host John Davidson&#x27;s hand on his mouth to block him from exhaling (after Davidson suggested that he could hear Hydrick blowing). However, Hydrick had readjusted the pencil beforehand so that it was as precarious as possible and would move with the slight manipulation of his hands. He also caused a page from a telephone book to turn over, allegedly by telekinesis. Magician and paranormal skeptic James Randi awarded the program a 1980 Uri Award, later renamed the Pigasus Award, &quot;for declaring a simple magic trick to be genuine.&quot;

==Exposure as fraud==
James Randi replicated the pencil trick on a similar show, &quot;That&#x27;s My Line,&quot; hosted by Bob Barker, demonstrating that it was a simple illusion and not a product of telekinesis. Hydrick and Randi both appeared in a follow-up episode of the show, Hydrick to demonstrate his telekinesis, while Randi was determined to prove it was only a trick. Barker and Randi offered $10,000 if Hydrick would be able to move the pages of a phone book under certain conditions. To do this, Randi placed foam peanuts on the table around the phone book to show if Hydrick was actually turning the pages by blowing on them. As Hydrick attempted to turn the page, his &quot;powers&quot; failed him; he claimed that the stage lights were causing the foam pieces to generate a static electric charge which, when added to the weight of the page, required more force than he was able to generate to turn the page; Randi and the judges countered that this hypothesis had no scientific basis. After 45 minutes with no results, Hydrick finally conceded his inability to complete the challenge, and the judging panel, which included a parapsychologist, declared that no supernatural phenomenon had taken place. At the end of the episode, Randi, to further discredit Hydrick, performed the same trick, openly demonstrating the blowing technique Hydrick used.

In 1981, Hydrick&#x27;s so-called psychic powers were conclusively exposed as frauds by investigative journalist and professional magician Dan Korem. Hydrick confessed to Korem that he had developed his trick in prison, and that he had not learned it from a Chinese master as he originally claimed. Hydrick confessed, &quot;My whole idea behind this in the first place was to see how dumb America was. How dumb the world is.&quot;

==Child molestation==
Wanted on an outstanding warrant, Hydrick was apprehended after police saw him discussing psychic powers on the &quot;Sally Jessy Raphael&quot; talk show. In 1989, Hydrick was sentenced to 17 years for molesting five boys in Huntington Beach, California. After serving his sentence, he was remanded to Atascadero State Hospital for treatment under the state&#x27;s sexually violent predator law. Psychologist Jesus Padilla described Hydrick as &quot;an extremely difficult patient&quot; who suffers from pedophilia, paraphilia, and antisocial personality disorder. Hydrick petitioned for release in May 2013, but a trial resulted in a hung jury. , he is housed at the Coalinga State Hospital.

<doc id="376936" wikidata="Q20798993" url="?curid=376936" title="Tărtăria tablets">
<text>The Tărtăria tablets () are three tablets, reportedly discovered in 1961 at a Neolithic site in the village of Tărtăria in Săliștea commune (about from Alba Iulia), from Transylvania.

The tablets bear incised symbols associated with the corpus of the Vinča symbols and have been the subject of considerable controversy among archaeologists, some of whom have argued that the symbols represent the earliest known form of writing in the world. Accurately dating the tablets is difficult as the stratigraphy pertaining to their discovery is disputed, and a heat treatment performed after their discovery has prevented the possibility of directly radiocarbon dating the tablets.

Based on the account of their discovery which associates the tablets with the Vinča culture and on indirect radiocarbon evidence, some scientists propose that the tablets date to around , predating Mesopotamian pictographic proto-writing. Some scholars have disputed the authenticity of the account of their discovery, suggesting the tablets are an intrusion from the upper strata of the site. Other scholars, contesting the radiocarbon dates for Neolithic Southeastern Europe, have suggested that Tărtăria signs are in some way related to Mesopotamian proto-writing, particularly Sumerian proto-cuneiform, which they argued was contemporary.

== Discovery ==

In 1961, members of a team led by Nicolae Vlassa (an archaeologist at the National Museum of Transylvanian History, Cluj-Napoca) reportedly unearthed three inscribed but unfired clay tablets, twenty-six clay and stone figurines, a shell bracelet, and the burnt, broken, and disarticulated bones of an adult female sometimes referred to as &quot;Milady Tărtăria&quot;.

There is no consensus on the interpretation of the burial, but it has been suggested that the body was likely that of a respected local wise-person, shaman, or spirit-medium.

=== Disputed authenticity ===
It is disputed whether the tablets were actually found at the reported site, and Vlassa never discussed the circumstances of the find of the stratigraphy.

The authenticity of the engravings has also been disputed. A recent claim of forgery is based on the similarity between some of the symbols and reproductions of Sumerian symbols in popular Romanian literature available at the time of the discovery.

== Description ==

Two of the tablets are rectangular and the third is round. They are all small, the round one being only across, and two—the round one and one rectangular tablet—have holes drilled through them. All three have symbols inscribed on only one face. The unpierced rectangular tablet depicts a horned animal, an unclear figure, and a vegetal motif such as a branch or tree. The others consist of a variety of mainly abstract symbols.

=== Dating ===
Workers at the conservation department of the Cluj museum baked the originally unbaked clay tablets in order to preserve them, making it impossible to directly date the tablets with the carbon 14 method.

The tablets are generally believed to have belonged to the Vinča-Turdaș culture, which was originally thought to have originated around 2700 BCE by Serbian and Romanian archaeologists. The discovery garnered attention from the archeological world because it predates the first Minoan writing, the oldest known writing in Europe.

Subsequent radiocarbon dating of the other Tărtăria finds, extended by association also to the tablets, pushed the date of the site (and therefore of the whole Vinča culture) to approximately 5500 BCE, the time of the early Eridu phase of the Sumerian civilization in Mesopotamia. Still, this is disputed in light of apparently contradictory stratigraphic evidence.

It has been controversially claimed that if the symbols are indeed a form of writing, then writing in the Danubian culture would far predate the earliest Sumerian cuneiform script or Egyptian hieroglyphs. Thus, they would be the world&#x27;s earliest known form of writing.

== Historical context ==

=== Hypothesis of Danubian culture ===
The term Danubian culture was proposed by V. Gordon Childe to describe the first agrarian society in central and eastern Europe. This hypothesis and the appearance of writing in this space is supported by Marco Merlini, Harald Haarmann, Joan Marler, Gheorghe Lazarovici, and many others.

=== Proposed links to Sumerian culture ===
Colin Renfrew argues that the apparent similarities with Sumerian symbols are deceptive: 

=== Possibly related finds in the region ===

==== Artifacts bearing Vinča symbols ====

The Vinča symbols have been known since the late 19th century excavation by Zsófia Torma (1832–1899) at the Neolithic site of Turdaș (Hungarian: &quot;Tordos&quot;) in Transylvania, at the time part of Austria-Hungary, the type site of the Tordos culture, a late, regional variation of the Vinča culture.

==== Other artifacts ====
This group of artifacts, including the tablets, have some relation with the culture developed in the Black Sea – Aegean Sea area. Similar artefacts have been found in Bulgaria (e.g. the Gradeshnitsa tablets) and northern Greece (the Dispilio Tablet). The material and the style used for the Tartaria artefacts show some similarities to those used in the Cyclades area, as two of the statuettes are made of alabaster.

== Purpose and meaning ==
The meaning (if any) of the symbols is unknown, and their nature has been the subject of much debate.

=== Writing system ===
Scholars who conclude that the inscribed symbols are writing are basing their assessment on a few assumptions that are not universally endorsed:
*The existence of similar signs on other artifacts of the Danube civilization suggest that there was an inventory of standard shapes used by scribes.
*The symbols are highly standardised and have a rectilinear shape comparable to that manifested by archaic writing systems.
*The information communicated by each character was specific, with an unequivocal meaning.
*The inscriptions are sequenced in rows, whether horizontal, vertical, or circular.

If they do comprise a script, it is not known what kind of writing system they represent. Vlassa interpreted one of the Tărtăria tablets as a hunting scene and the other two with signs as a kind of primitive writing similar to the early pictograms of the Sumerians. Some archaeologists who support the idea that they do represent writing, notably Marija Gimbutas, have proposed that they are fragments of a system dubbed the Old European Script.

=== Non-linguistic signs ===
One problem is the lack of independent indications of literacy existing in the Balkans at this period. Sarunas Milisauskas comments that &quot;it is extremely difficult to demonstrate archaeologically whether a corpus of symbols constitutes a writing system&quot; and notes that the first known writing systems were all developed by early states to facilitate record-keeping in complex organised societies in the Middle East and Mediterranean. There is no evidence of organised states in the European Neolithic, thus it is unlikely they would have needed the administrative systems facilitated by writing. David Anthony notes that Chinese characters were first used for ritual and commemorative purposes associated with the &#x27;sacred power&#x27; of kings; it is possible that a similar usage accounts for the Tărtăria symbols. Some scholars have suggested that the symbols may have been used as marks of ownership or as the focus of religious rituals.

An alternative suggestion is that they may have been merely uncomprehending imitations of more advanced cultures, although this explanation is made rather unlikely by the great antiquity of the tablets—there were no known literate cultures at the time from which the symbols could have been adopted.

Others consider the pictograms to be accompanied by random scribbles.

<text>Töysä is a former municipality in Western Finland. It was consolidated to Alavus on 1 January 2013. It is part of the Southern Ostrobothnia region. The municipality had a population of (31 December 2012) and covered an area of of which was water. The population density is . Most inhabitants speak Finnish, with hardly any other languages being spoken.

Töysä is known for its shopping village Tuuri and the Veljekset Keskinen department store.

== History ==
The village of &quot;Töysäjärvi&quot; was established sometime before 1568. It was larger than the modern Töysä and a part of the Lapua parish. When the Kuortane chapel community was formed in 1645, Töysäjärvi was one of its villages. By the 17th century, the village&#x27;s name had been shortened to &quot;Töysä&quot;. Its western part was called Ala-Töysä while the eastern part was called Yli-Töysä. In 1798, Kuortane became a parish while Yli-Töysä became a chapel community within Kuortane named &quot;Töysä&quot;. At the same time, Ala-Töysä was moved to the Alavus chapel community. The name &quot;Ala-Töysä&quot; was later supplanted by &quot;Ranta-Töysä&quot;.

Töysä became a municipality in 1865 and got a parish in 1926. Töysä was consolidated with Alavus in 2013.

<doc id="376938" wikidata="Q896791" url="?curid=376938" title="Division of the assembly">
<text>In parliamentary procedure, a division of the assembly, division of the house, or simply division is a method of taking a vote that physically counts members voting.

Historically, and often still today, members are literally divided into physically separate groups. This was the method used in the Roman Senate (vote &quot;per secessionem&quot;), and occasionally in Athenian democracy. Westminster system parliament chambers have separate &quot;division lobbies&quot; for the &quot;Ayes&quot; and &quot;Noes&quot; to facilitate physical division. In several assemblies, a division bell is rung throughout the building when a division is happening, in order to alert members not present in the chamber. In the United Kingdom, division bells are also present in a number of bars and restaurants near the Palace of Westminster in order to call members to vote who may be outside the building.

== Australia ==

=== House of Representatives ===
In the Australian House of Representatives divisions follow a form similar to that of the United Kingdom, but the requirements are generally more stringent. For instance, a Member in the Chamber when the tellers are appointed must vote, while a Member not then present may not. Furthermore, members must vote in accordance to their voice votes.

The voice vote is held as in the British House of Commons. If more than one Member objects, then the division bells are rung throughout the Parliamentary estate. When not less than four minutes have elapsed since the question was first put, the Speaker orders that the doors to the Chamber be locked, and directs that the Ayes proceed to the right side of the Chamber, and that the Noes proceed to the left. Members then take seats on the appropriate side of the Chamber, rather than entering a lobby, and then the Speaker appoints tellers for each side, unless fewer than five Members are seated on one side, in which case the Speaker calls off the division and declares the result for the side with the greater number of Members. If the division is still on, the tellers count and record the names of the Members. The Speaker announces the result, but does not vote unless there is an equality of votes. (If only one Member objects, his objection may be noted on the Hansard, but no vote is taken.)

=== Senate ===
In the Australian Senate, a procedure similar to that of the House of Representatives is followed. The voice vote is taken, and, if two Senators object, a division is held. Senators take seats in the right or left of the Chamber as in the House, and the President of the Senate appoints one teller for each side to record the votes. The President may vote by stating to the Senate the side on which he intends to vote. If the result of the division is an equality of votes, then the motion is in all cases disagreed to.

=== Parliament of Victoria ===
The lower house of the australian state of Victoria, the Victorian Legislative Assembly has adopted the &quot;party voting&quot; procedure for divisions identical to that used by the New Zealand Parliament for most divisions. The Victorian Legislative Council, as well as the Legislative Assembly for conscience issues, continues to use the standing vote procedure adopted by the federal Parliament.

== Canada ==
The procedure used in the House of Commons of Canada is similar to that in the British House of Commons, with a few differences. The Speaker reads the question aloud, and then asks, &quot;Is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion?&quot; If anyone dissents, the Speaker then states &quot;all those in favour of the motion will please say yea.&quot; After the cries of &#x27;yea&#x27;, the Speaker says &quot;all those opposed will please say nay,&quot; and all members opposed to the question cry out &#x27;nay&#x27; all at once. The Speaker then announces his opinion of the outcome of the vote. If five or more MPs challenge the Speaker&#x27;s opinion, a formal division follows.

A formal division is invoked by the Speaker asking to &quot;call in the members.&quot; Bells are rung throughout the Parliament Buildings for either 15 or 30 minutes to allow all present MPs time to enter the chamber and take their seats. The division begins with the whips from both the government and the official opposition bowing to the Speaker and each other before returning to their seats.

There are no division lobbies in the House of Commons, so each member votes by simply standing up from his or her seat. &quot;Yea&quot; votes are recorded first, followed by the &quot;Nay&quot; votes, on the Speaker&#x27;s order. Finally, the clerk of the house reads the result of the vote aloud to the Speaker.

== Germany ==
In the German Bundestag and some state parliaments the president can call for the so-called &quot;&quot; (literally, &quot;wether’s leap&quot;) if an undisputed majority couldn&#x27;t be established by either MPs raising their hands or standing in order to cast their votes.
In this voting procedure the MPs leave the plenary hall and re-enter through one of three doors designated for &quot;yes“ (&quot;ja&quot;), &quot;abstention&quot; (&quot;&quot;), or &quot;no&quot; (&quot;nein&quot;).

According to the Duden dictionary, the expression refers to the MPs grouping themselves like sheep behind their respective bellwethers before re-entering the chamber. The procedure was introduced in 1874 by a Reichstag vice president. In 1894 the architect of the new Reichstag building made a reference to the &quot;&quot;: above the door for &quot;yes&quot;, he depicted Ulysses and his friends escaping from Polyphemus.

== Ireland ==
In Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas, a division is a formal count that can be called for if a voice vote is deemed insufficient. The procedure for voting and divisions is specified by standing orders 70–77. In Seanad Éireann, the upper house, a similar procedure is laid out by standing orders 56–63. In the Dáil the Ceann Comhairle (chair) puts the question and TDs (deputies) present say the Irish word &quot;tá&quot; (yes) or &quot;níl&quot; (no) respectively if they agree or disagree. The Ceann Comhairle then gives an opinion on the voice vote. Any TD may demand a division by calling &quot;Vótáil&quot; (vote). Since 2016, in an effort to reduce delays, many divisions are deferred until a weekly division time on Thursdays when they are taken one after another. Previous to this, if the Ceann Comhairle suspected that fewer than ten TDs had called for a division, he asked them to rise; if the number was less than ten, their names were entered in the Dáil record but no division occurred. This process still is still used when holding the Thursday vote on a question, but the deferral of the vote until Thursday happens regardless of how few demand a vote.

The Dáil and Seanad division bells are reproductions respectively of the Lough Lene Bell and the Bell of Armagh; At a division, bells sound and bulbs light around Leinster House and the adjoining Oireachtas buildings, calling legislators to the chamber; with differing sounds and lights for Dáil and Seanad votes. The bells ring for between two and six minutes, and the doors to the chamber are locked after a further one to four minutes. The Ceann Comhairle then appoints two tellers for each side and deputies present are given one minute to vote. Voting is usually electronic, with deputies pressing either the (yes) or (no) button on their desks. After the voting time has concluded a Division Paper recording the result and each TD&#x27;s vote is signed by the four tellers and given to the Ceann Comhairle, who declares the result. Electronic voting was introduced in 2002. The traditional practice of voting by physically entering division lobbies is retained for some symbolically important votes: confidence motions and nominations of Ceann Comhairle, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and cabinet ministers.

A group of at least 20 TDs may demand a non-electronic repeat of an electronic vote. A summer 2016 upgrade to the electronic voting system allowed a change to standing orders such that TDs may have an abstention from voting () formally recorded; for other purposes this is treated the same as not voting.

Since 2016, the Ceann Comhairle has been elected in a secret ballot by alternative vote (ranked ballot), with the winner&#x27;s ensuing nomination uncontested without a division. Secret-ballot single transferable vote elections were used in the 1920s, for the Dáil&#x27;s 30 nominees to the 1922 Seanad, and for the Dáil and Seanad&#x27;s separate slates of candidates in the 1925 Seanad election. Ballots were distributed and submitted in the assembly chamber, then removed for counting; Dáil results were announced by the Ceann Comhairle in the chamber, whereas the Seanad adjourned for the day and allowed its Cathaoirleach (chair) to announce the results to the press that evening.

===Incidents===
During the renomination of Taoiseach of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Jack Lynch after the 1969 election, the division bell continued to ring after the doors had been locked, while several Fianna Fáil deputies entered the chamber through an unlocked door.

In October 2019 several TDs admitted having, over previous months, pressed the voting button of an absent party colleague, either by accident or when they believed the colleague was elsewhere in the chamber during the division. News media reported that the Ceann Comhairle would propose suspending electronic voting pending investigation. On 22 October the Dáil committee on procedure commissioned a review by the clerk of the Dáil of the instances first reported, which had occurred on 17 October. The clerk&#x27;s review and recommended changes to procedure was endorsed and published by the committee on 24 October, and debated in the Dáil chamber the same day. Some politicians described the report as a whitewash.

==New Zealand==

In the New Zealand House of Representatives, division of the assembly occurs when the result of a voice vote on a motion is split, and a member disagrees with the Speaker&#x27;s call. There are two methods for handling a division: a &quot;party vote&quot; and a &quot;personal vote&quot;.

A &quot;party vote&quot; is the most common method, and occurs for non-conscience issues and some conscience issues. In this method, the Clerk of the House reads out each party&#x27;s name in order of the number of seats each party has, starting with the largest party, followed by any independent members and any members wishing to cross the floor. A member of the party (usually a whip) will respond to their party&#x27;s name by stating how many members of the party are in favour or opposed. The Clerk tallies up the votes and gives the results to the Speaker, who declares the result. A &quot;split party vote&quot; is a variation of the party vote, used for some conscience issues. The main difference is voting members state how many members of their party are in favour and how many members are opposed, and once the voting is completed, must table a list of the members of the party and how they voted.

A &quot;personal vote&quot; is used mainly for conscience issues, and follows similar procedures to other Westminster systems. In the event of a personal vote, the division bells are rung for seven minutes, and after the bells stops, members are instructed to move to one of two lobbies, &quot;Ayes&quot; or &quot;Noes&quot;, to have their vote recorded as such. Once all the votes are tallied, the results are handed to the speaker who declares the result.

An unusual division occurred on 30 August 2012, simulating an exhaustive ballot for a three-way conscience vote on New Zealand&#x27;s legal drinking age. All members were directed to the Noes lobby, where the Clerk of the House recorded each member&#x27;s vote (either for keeping the age at 18, raising the age to 20, or raising the off-licence age to 20 while keeping the on-licence age at 18) as they passed back into the main debating chamber. The votes were tallied and handed back to the Speaker, who declared the results as 50 votes for 18 years, 38 votes for 20 years, and 33 votes for an 18/20 split. As no option acquired the 61-vote majority needed, the option with the lowest number of votes (18/20 split) was dropped, and the members voted again as per a normal personal vote, using the Ayes lobby for 18 years and Noes lobby for 20 years.

==United Kingdom==

=== House of Commons ===

In the House of Commons, the Speaker says &quot;The Question is that...&quot;, states the question and next says &quot;As many as there are of the opinion say Aye&quot;. Then, following shouts of &quot;Aye&quot;, the Speaker says &quot;Of the contrary, No&quot; and similar shouts of &quot;No&quot; may follow. If one side clearly has more support, the Speaker then announces their opinion as to the winner, stating, for example, &quot;I think the Ayes have it, the Ayes have it&quot;. Otherwise, the Speaker declares a division.

Any member may object to the Speaker&#x27;s determination. If feeling that the division is unnecessary, the Speaker may first ask those who support the determination of the voice vote to rise, and then ask those who oppose the opinion to rise. Then, the Speaker may either declare that the ruling on the voice vote stands, or proceed to a division.

The practice of voting by division seems to derive from the layout of St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel, the meeting place of the House of Commons before the fire of 1834. The chapel had an anteroom, and by 1584 votes were regularly held by having MPs from one side depart the chamber for this anteroom, while the other side would remain in the chamber. By 1690, it was established that those voting Aye would depart for the anteroom, while Noes would remain in the chamber. After the fire destroyed St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel, the House of Commons Chamber was rebuilt with two lobbies, one for Ayes and one for Noes.

If a division is to be taken, the Speaker first states, &quot;Division! Clear the lobbies!&quot; Like all parliamentary procedure, there is a historical reason for the tradition. In this case it was a division that took place on 27 February 1771 when a non-MP (known as a &#x27;stranger&#x27;), Thomas Hunt, was included in the &#x27;Noes&#x27; vote. It subsequently transpired that he had voted several times previously. The division bell then sounds across the Parliamentary Estate as well as several buildings in the vicinity, such as restaurants and pubs. (For a full list see external bells.) The lobbies are cleared of strangers, these days primarily journalists, but historically could have been members of the public. Division bells notify any members not currently in the chamber that a vote is about to start. A recent development has been the use of pagers and mobile phones by party whips, to summon members from further afield. At the beginning of a division, two MPs who intend to vote in favour and two MPs who intend to vote against communicate to the Speaker their intentions to act as tellers.

Two minutes into the division the Speaker puts the question to the House again. If it is clear that a division is still required, the Speaker announces the names of the tellers. In order to ensure impartiality, in each lobby there is one teller for the Ayes (i.e. a teller who intends to vote in favour) and one teller for the Noes (i.e. a teller who intends to vote against). If there are tellers for one side but not for the other, the question is decided in favour of the side for which there are tellers (for instance, if there are no tellers for the Noes, the Aye side automatically wins the division, and vice versa).

MPs have to walk through one of the two division lobbies on either side of the House, tapping their pass against one of several readers installed in the lobbies, in order to vote. They are then counted by the two tellers as they leave the lobby; the numbers they record are the definitive result of the division. The whips keep check on which MPs enter which lobby and try to persuade them to enter the lobby that the party would like them to enter. Until 2020, the names of Members voting in each lobby were recorded by clerks rather than electronic systems, but this procedure was reformed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Division List, recording the way in which MPs voted, is automatically made available on the Parliament website soon after a division. In October 2022, then-Prime Minister Liz Truss was erroneously thought to have abstained from her own government&#x27;s motion against a Labour motion to ban fracking as she had forgotten to swipe her voting card.

MPs with a direct financial interest on any matter are prohibited from voting. In order to act as a disqualification, the matter must be immediate and personal and not a general or remote matter.

Eight minutes after the question has been put for the first time, the Speaker declares, &quot;Lock the doors!&quot; The lobby entrances are locked, and only those within the lobbies may continue to vote.

After all members have voted in the lobbies, the vote totals are written on a card and the numbers are read out to the House by one of the tellers of the winning side announcing as follows; &quot;The Ayes to the right: (number of votes), The Noes to the left: (number of votes)&quot;. The Speaker then announces these numbers a second time, announcing the final result by saying &quot;The Ayes/Noes have it, the Ayes/Noes have it&quot;. The Speaker then adds: &quot;Unlock.&quot; Tellers are not included among the numbers announced to the Speaker. The Speaker only votes if a tie arises; in that case, he (or she) verbally announces his (or her) vote, which is cast in accordance with Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule.

Members may signify, but not record, an abstention by remaining in their seats during the division. Though the practice is traditionally frowned upon, MPs can also pass through both lobbies, effectively registering their abstention.

It is stipulated that all Members of Parliament are required to stay in or around the premises of the House of Commons until the main business of the day has ended, however long that may be. In the unlikely event that fewer than forty members participate in the division (including the speaker and the tellers), the division is declared &#x27;inquorate&#x27;, the question at hand is postponed until the next sitting, and the House proceeds to the next business.

The nature of divisions in the House of Commons is one which traditionally could go on well into the night, sometimes past midnight. However, in 2000 the House introduced, on an experimental basis, the procedure of &quot;Deferred Divisions.&quot; Essentially, some divisions are delayed until the next Wednesday. The procedure is used for very few matters; most divisions still occur normally.

There have been suggestions that electronic voting may be easier and quicker to do than physically going through a division lobby. However, MPs have often found that a division is the best way to interact with senior members of the government.

There are two variations to the normal practice of an MP voting by walking through the respective lobby.

====Nodding through====

There have been cases where Members of Parliament are wheeled from far afield to vote for their party in a crucial vote. For members who are too ill to reach the lobby, there is a procedure called &#x27;nodding through&#x27; provided the tellers agree. The whips will ensure that the MP&#x27;s name is added to the list of those voting. There are only two conditions. The MP must be within the precincts of the Palace of Westminster, and must be alive. Former MP Joe Ashton remembered a case from the final days of James Callaghan&#x27;s government:

====Pairing====

&#x27;Pairing&#x27; is an arrangement between two opposing MPs where both agree not to participate in any divisions because their votes would cancel each other out anyway. Pairing agreements can last anything from days to the life of the Parliament. All pairings have to be registered with the party whips so that they know not to pursue their member for failing to vote.

=== House of Lords ===

In the House of Lords, the Lord Speaker proposes the question and announces the result as in the Commons, but substitutes &quot;Content&quot; for &quot;Aye&quot; and &quot;Not-content&quot; for &quot;No&quot;. A Lord may object to the Lord Speaker&#x27;s determination. The Lord Speaker then announces a division by stating, &quot;Clear the Bar!&quot; The Bar of the House is then cleared. Tellers are appointed as in the Commons.

Three minutes after the question was first proposed, the Lord Speaker again proposes the question as above. If his opinion is not challenged, then the question is decided without a division. But if his decision is once again disputed, the Lord Speaker may again ask the question. The question may be repeated as many times as the Lord Speaker pleases; the process is referred to as &quot;collecting the voices&quot;. But if a single Lord maintains an objection, the Lord Speaker, not having the Commons Speaker&#x27;s power to declare a division unnecessary, must eventually announce, &quot;The Contents to the right by the Throne, the Not-contents to the left by the Bar&quot;. Lords then vote in the lobbies, as it is done in the Commons. Unlike the Speaker, the Lord Speaker may vote during a division; he does so from his seat rather than in a lobby. In the event that the votes are equal, then the following principles apply, but are implemented by the Standing Orders of the House rather than by convention:

* Legislation remains unchanged unless there is a majority in favour of amendment,
* Legislation is allowed to proceed to the next stage unless there is a majority in favour of rejection, and
* All other motions are rejected unless there is a majority in favour of passage.

The quorum for divisions is three Lords on a procedural vote and thirty Lords on a substantive one.

=== Northern Ireland Assembly ===

The Northern Ireland Assembly maintains a lobby voting system based on that used in the UK House of Commons, this is in contrast to other devolved legislatures in the United Kingdom and was inherited by the Assembly from the House of Commons of Northern Ireland for whom the current Assembly debating chamber was originally constructed. 

When a vote is required the Assembly Speaker will state &quot;The Question is put ...&quot; and then note the question that the members are asked to vote upon. The speaker will then conduct a voice vote and if the result of that vote is not conclusive, the Speaker will declare &quot;The Assembly will divide&quot; and call for the lobbies on either side of the chamber to be cleared of non-members and Tellers appointed for both aye and noe. Members vote by entering the appropriate lobby on either side of the chamber, ayes to the Speaker&#x27;s right, noes to the Speaker&#x27;s left, with the result reported to the Speaker by the tellers and announced to the Assembly by the Speaker.

As in the UK House of Commons, it is possible for members to vote in both lobbies, registering two votes that cancel each other out, in order to signify an active abstention

==United States ==

In the United States Congress, divisions are used to give a more accurate estimate of a vote than a voice vote. Typically, a division is taken when the result of a voice vote is challenged or when a two-thirds vote is required.

A division is also called a &quot;rising vote&quot;, where members stand up from their seats. According to Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), the numbers for and against are not counted in a division. However, they may be counted by order of the chairman or by order of the assembly through majority vote. The assembly may also have a rule that the division is counted.

Unlike the British Parliament, in Congress, lobbies are not used, and the division is not a final determination of the question. The vote is first taken by voice vote, as is the case in Parliament. Then, any member may demand a division. If a division is demanded, then the Speaker of the House of Representatives (or, more commonly, a Representative of the majority party designated by the Speaker to preside as Speaker pro tempore) or the Presiding Officer of the Senate asks those voting &quot;Yea&quot; to rise and remain standing until counted, and then asks those voting &quot;Nay&quot; to do the same. A division is the least common method of voting in the Senate.

A recorded vote must take place upon the demand of one-fifth of members present under Article I, Section 5 of the United States Constitution: &quot;the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.&quot; In the Senate, a recorded vote is accomplished by the clerk&#x27;s call of the roll. In the House, an electronic voting device is typically used to take recorded votes, although occasionally roll calls take place; the House is historically too large to conduct roll calls on a regular basis (435 members versus 100 in the Senate). When voting to override a Presidential veto, the yeas and nays are required under Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution.

<text>Săliștea (; ), known as &quot;Cioara&quot; until 1965, is a commune located in Alba County, Transylvania, Romania. The old name of &quot;Cioara&quot; is still widely used, especially by local residents.

It is composed of four villages: Mărgineni, Săliștea, Săliștea-Deal, and Tărtăria (&quot;Alsótatárlaka&quot;).

==Geography==
Săliștea is located near the Mureș River in the southwestern part of Alba County. The centre of the commune is situated north of a main Romanian National Road, namely the DN7, to which is connected by the county road DJ705E. The nearest cities are Sebeș (21 km), Cugir (25 km) and the county capital, Alba Iulia (27 km).

The bordering communes are Blandiana in the north, Vințu de Jos in the north-east, Pianu in the east, the town of Cugir in the west and Șibot in the south.

The relief is dominated by the low terraces of the river Mureș in the north and the high plateau and several hills in the south. The highest hills, Globul, Hălmul and Coasta Răchitii, are about high. Other hills are Văratecul (630 m), Dealul Mare (452 m), Dealul Ciorii (424 m), Dealul Calului (389 m) and Munceii Rotunzi (341 m).

The mean annual temperatures range between .

==History==
The oldest traces of human activity in Săliștea date back to the Vinča culture of the Middle Neolithic. The Tărtăria tablets dated 5300 BC were discovered in the village of Tărtăria, part of the Săliștea commune, in 1961 by a team of Romanian archaeologists led by Nicolae Vlassa.

Other archaeological findings indicate the existence of a Dacian settlement in this area. The main discovery was a series of 62 pieces of silver artifacts, found in 1820 by Matei Molodeț, a villager from Săliștea. Several coins dated back to the times of Roman Dacia were also found by archaeologists.

The first attestation of a village in the area occupied today by Săliștea dates back to 4 November 1310, when by order of king Charles I of Hungary, the village of Archișul Românesc (Romanian Archiș) was donated to Count Reneriu from Vințu de Jos. The other village, Drejman, was attested in a document from 29 June 1375, when by order of king Louis I of Hungary, &quot;villa Drasman&quot; is inherited by Reneriu&#x27;s granddaughters.

On 23 May 1458 Archișul Românesc and Drejman were united to form the village of Cioara, named after the stream Cioara, a tributary of river Mureș. It is possible that the stream Cioara was named after the famous inn close to the village of Archișul Românesc and Drejman, that had as an emblem a crow (in Romanian: &quot;cioară&quot; or &quot;corb&quot;). The emblem of the inn was also the emblem of the Barcsay noble family from Bârcea Mare, Hunedoara, that was attested in this area in several documents from 1458 and 1462, and became the dominant noble family in Săliștea starting from 1508.

The village of Cioara is linked to Sofronie of Cioara, the Eastern Orthodox Monk and Saint of the Romanian Orthodox Church who, between the autumn of 1759 and the spring of 1761, led the peaceful uprising of the Romanian Orthodox population against the Habsburg policy of encouraging all Romanians to join the Greek-Catholic Church. In 1701, the Emperor Leopold I decreed Transylvania&#x27;s Orthodox Church to be one with the Roman Catholic Church. Sofronie&#x27;s peaceful uprising advocated for freedom of worship and the right of the Romanian population in Transylvania to have a Romanian Orthodox bishop. As a response to Sofronie&#x27;s movement, the Austrian military commander systematically destroyed the monasteries in Transylvania that had served as centres of the uprising, including the one in Cioara. In the end however, The Orthodox achieved a notable victory: recognition by the court of Vienna of the legal existence of their church and the appointment of a bishop in person of Dionisije Novaković.

Several historians also showed the involvement of several villagers from Cioara in the Revolt of Horea, Cloșca and Crișan and the Transylvanian Memorandum movement.

A number of 550 inhabitants of Cioara fought during World War I in the Austro-Hungarian Army and most of them as volunteers in the Romanian Army in the second part of the war. Sixty-five of them were reported dead in action.

On 1 December 1918, the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia proclaimed the Union of Transylvania with Romania. Several people from Cioara took part in the Assembly, including the local priest, Constantin Oancea, who was one of the speakers in the Assembly.

During World War II, more than 250 people from Cioara fought in the Romanian Army, of which 45 died in action. After the war, 65 children from Bessarabia, including their teacher, found refuge in the commune.

The name of the commune was changed in 1965 from Cioara to Săliștea.

==Population==
According to the 2002 census, there were 2,374 people living in Săliștea (100% Romanians), of which 1,252 in the centre of the commune, 745 in Tărtăria, 309 in Săliștea Deal, and 77 in Mărgineni. At the 2011 census, the population had decreased to 2,197. At the 2021 census, there were 2,155 inhabitants in the commune, of which 2,039 were Romanians.

<doc id="376948" wikidata="Q1136880" url="?curid=376948" title="Power of two">
<text>A power of two is a number of the form where is an integer, that is, the result of exponentiation with number two as the base and integer  as the exponent. In the fast-growing hierarchy, is exactly equal to formula_1. In the Hardy hierarchy, is exactly equal to formula_2.

Powers of two with non-negative exponents are integers: , , and is two multiplied by itself times. The first ten powers of 2 for non-negative values of are:
:1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, ... 

By comparison, powers of two with negative exponents are fractions: for positive integer , is one half multiplied by itself times. Thus the first few negative powers of 2 are , , , , etc. Sometimes these are called &quot;inverse powers of two&quot; because each is the multiplicative inverse of a positive power of two.

== Base of the binary numeral system ==
Because two is the base of the binary numeral system, powers of two are common in computer science. Written in binary, a power of two always has the form 100...000 or 0.00...001, just like a power of 10 in the decimal system.

== Computer science ==
Two to the power of , written as , is the number of values in which the bits in a binary word of length can be set, where each bit is either of two values. A word, interpreted as representing an integer in a range starting at zero, referred to as an &quot;unsigned integer&quot;, can represent values from 0 () to  () inclusively. An alternative representation, referred to as a signed integer, allows values that can be positive, negative and zero; see &quot;Signed number representations&quot;. Either way, one less than a power of two is often the upper bound of an integer in binary computers. As a consequence, numbers of this form show up frequently in computer software. As an example, a video game running on an 8-bit system might limit the score or the number of items the player can hold to 255—the result of using a byte, which is 8 bits long, to store the number, allowing the representation of 256 distinct values from to . For example, in the original &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; the main character was limited to carrying 255 rupees (the currency of the game) at any given time, and the video game Pac-Man famously has a kill screen at level 256.

Powers of two are often used to define units in which to quantify computer memory sizes. A &quot;byte&quot; now typically refers to eight bits (an octet), resulting in the possibility of 256 values (28). (The term &quot;byte&quot; once meant (and in some cases, still means) a collection of bits that was defined by the hardware context, typically of 5 to 32 bits, rather than only an 8-bit unit.) The prefix &quot;kilo&quot;, in conjunction with &quot;byte&quot;, has been used by computer scientists to mean (210). However, in general, the term &quot;kilo&quot; has been used in the International System of Units to mean (103). Binary prefixes have been standardized, such as &quot;kibi&quot; (Ki) meaning . Nearly all processor registers have sizes that are a power of two bits, 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits being very common, with the last two being most common except for very small processors.

Powers of two occur in a range of other places as well. For many disk drives, at least one of the sector size, number of sectors per track, and number of tracks per surface is a power of two. The logical block size is almost always a power of two.

Numbers that are closely related to powers of two occur in a number of computer hardware designs, such as with the number of pixels in the width and height of video screens, where the number of pixels in each direction is often the product of a power of two and a small number. For example, , and .

== Mersenne and Fermat primes ==
A prime number that is one less than a power of two is called a Mersenne prime. For example, the prime number 31 is a Mersenne prime because it is 1 less than 32 (25). Similarly, a prime number (like 257) that is one more than a positive power of two is called a Fermat prime—the exponent itself is a power of two. A fraction that has a power of two as its denominator is called a dyadic rational. The numbers that can be represented as sums of consecutive positive integers are called polite numbers; they are exactly the numbers that are not powers of two.

== Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, Book IX ==
The geometric progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... (or, in the binary numeral system, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, ... ) is important in number theory. Book IX, Proposition 36 of &quot;Elements&quot; proves that if the sum of the first terms of this progression is a prime number (and thus is a Mersenne prime as mentioned above), then this sum times the th term is a perfect number. For example, the sum of the first 5 terms of the series , which is a prime number. The sum 31 multiplied by 16 (the 5th term in the series) equals 496, which is a perfect number.

Book IX, Proposition 35, proves that in a geometric series if the first term is subtracted from the second and last term in the sequence, then as the excess of the second is to the first—so is the excess of the last to all those before it. (This is a restatement of our formula for geometric series from above.) Applying this to the geometric progression 31, 62, 124, 248, 496 (which results from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 by multiplying all terms by 31), we see that 62 minus 31 is to 31 as 496 minus 31 is to the sum of 31, 62, 124, 248. Therefore, the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124 and 248 add up to 496 and further these are all the numbers that divide 496. For suppose that divides 496 and it is not amongst these numbers. Assume is equal to , or 31 is to as is to 16. Now cannot divide 16 or it would be amongst the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16.
Therefore, 31 cannot divide . And since 31 does not divide and measures 496, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic implies that must divide 16 and be among the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16. Let be 4, then must be 124, which is impossible since by hypothesis is not amongst the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124 or 248.

== First 64 powers of two ==

=== Last digits ===
Starting with 2 the last digit is periodic with period 4, with the cycle 2–4–8–6–, and starting with 4 the last two digits are periodic with period 20. These patterns are generally true of any power, with respect to any base. The pattern continues where each pattern has starting point , and the period is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo , which is (see &quot;Multiplicative group of integers modulo n&quot;).

== Powers of 1024 ==
The first few powers of 210 are slightly larger than those same powers of (103). The first 11 powers of 210 values are listed below:

It takes approximately 17 powers of 1024 to reach 50% deviation and approximately 29 powers of 1024 to reach 100% deviation of the same powers of 1000. Also see &quot;Binary prefixes&quot; and &quot;IEEE 1541-2002&quot;.

== Powers of two whose exponents are powers of two ==
Because data (specifically integers) and the addresses of data are stored using the same hardware, and the data is stored in one or more octets (), double exponentials of two are common. The first 21 of them are:
Also see &quot;Fermat number&quot;, &quot;Tetration&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

=== Last digits for powers of two whose exponents are powers of two ===
All of these numbers over 4 end with the digit 6. Starting with 16 the last two digits are periodic with period 4, with the cycle 16–56–36–96–, and starting with 16 the last three digits are periodic with period 20. These patterns are generally true of any power, with respect to any base. The pattern continues where each pattern has starting point , and the period is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo , which is (see &quot;Multiplicative group of integers modulo n&quot;).

=== Facts about powers of two whose exponents are powers of two ===
In a connection with nimbers, these numbers are often called &quot;Fermat 2-powers&quot;.

The numbers formula_3 form an irrationality sequence: for every sequence formula_4 of positive integers, the series
: formula_5
converges to an irrational number. Despite the rapid growth of this sequence, it is the slowest-growing irrationality sequence known.

=== Powers of two whose exponents are powers of two in computer science ===
Since it is common for computer data types to have a &quot;size&quot; which is a power of two, these numbers count the number of representable &quot;values&quot; of that type. For example, a 32-bit word consisting of 4 bytes can represent distinct values, which can either be regarded as mere bit-patterns, or are more commonly interpreted as the unsigned numbers from 0 to , or as the range of signed numbers between and . For more about representing signed numbers see &quot;Two&#x27;s complement&quot;.

== Powers of two in music theory ==

In musical notation, all unmodified note values have a duration equal to a whole note divided by a power of two; for example a half note (1/2), a quarter note (1/4), an eighth note (1/8) and a sixteenth note (1/16). Dotted or otherwise modified notes have other durations. In time signatures the lower numeral, the &quot;beat unit&quot;, which can be seen as the denominator of a fraction, is almost always a power of two.

If the ratio of frequencies of two pitches is a power of two, then the interval between those pitches is full octaves. In this case, the corresponding notes have the same name.

The mathematical coincidence formula_6, from formula_7, closely relates the interval of 7 semitones in equal temperament to a perfect fifth of just intonation: formula_8, correct to about 0.1%. The just fifth is the basis of Pythagorean tuning; the difference between twelve just fifths and seven octaves is the Pythagorean comma.

The sum of all -choose binomial coefficients is equal to . Consider the set of all -digit binary integers. Its cardinality is . It is also the sums of the cardinalities of certain subsets: the subset of integers with no 1s (consisting of a single number, written as 0s), the subset with a single 1, the subset with two 1s, and so on up to the subset with 1s (consisting of the number written as 1s). Each of these is in turn equal to the binomial coefficient indexed by and the number of 1s being considered (for example, there are 10-choose-3 binary numbers with ten digits that include exactly three 1s).

Currently, powers of two are the only known almost perfect numbers.

The cardinality of the power set of a set is always , where is the cardinality of .

The number of vertices of an -dimensional hypercube is . Similarly, the number of -faces of an -dimensional cross-polytope is also and the formula for the number of -faces an -dimensional cross-polytope has is formula_9

The sum of the first formula_10 powers of two (starting from formula_11) is given by
: formula_12
for formula_10 being any positive integer.

Thus, the sum of the powers

can be computed simply by evaluating: formula_15 (which is the &quot;chess number&quot;).

The sum of the reciprocals of the powers of two is 1. The sum of the reciprocals of the squared powers of two (powers of four) is 1/3.

Every power of 2 (excluding 1) can be written as the sum of four square numbers in 24 ways. The powers of 2 are the natural numbers greater than 1 that can be written as the sum of four square numbers in the fewest ways.

As a real polynomial, &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; + &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; is irreducible, if and only if &quot;n&quot; is a power of two. (If &quot;n&quot; is odd, then &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; + &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; is divisible by &quot;a&quot;+&quot;b&quot;, and if &quot;n&quot; is even but not a power of 2, then &quot;n&quot; can be written as &quot;n&quot; = &quot;mp&quot;, where &quot;m&quot; is odd, and thus formula_17, which is divisible by &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; + &quot;b&quot;&quot;p&quot;.)
But in the domain of complex numbers, the polynomial formula_18 (where &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1) can always be factorized as
formula_19, 
even if &quot;n&quot; is a power of two.

The only known powers of 2 with all digits even are 21 = 2, 22 = 4, 23 = 8, 26 = 64 and 211 = . The first 3 powers of 2 with all but last digit odd is 24 = 16, 25 = 32 and 29 = 512. The next such power of 2 of form 2&quot;n&quot; should have &quot;n&quot; of at least 6 digits. The only powers of 2 with all digits distinct are 20 = 1 to 215 = , 220 = and 229 = .

<text>Claude Bernard (; 12 July 1813 – 10 February 1878) was a French physiologist. I. Bernard Cohen of Harvard University called Bernard &quot;one of the greatest of all men of science&quot;. He originated the term &quot;milieu intérieur&quot; and the associated concept of homeostasis (the latter term being coined by Walter Cannon).

== Life and career ==
Bernard was born in 12 July 1813 in the village of Saint-Julien, near Villefranche-sur-Saône. He received his early education in the Jesuit school of that town, and then proceeded to the college at Lyon, which, however, he soon left to become assistant in a druggist&#x27;s shop. He is sometimes described as an agnostic, and even humorously referred to by his colleagues as a &quot;great priest of atheism&quot;. Despite this, after his death Cardinal Ferdinand Donnet claimed Bernard was a fervent Catholic, with a biographical entry in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;. His leisure hours were devoted to the composition of a vaudeville comedy, and the success it achieved moved him to attempt a prose drama in five acts, &quot;Arthur de Bretagne&quot;.

In 1834, at the age of twenty-one, he went to Paris, armed with this play and an introduction to Saint-Marc Girardin, but the critic dissuaded him from adopting literature as a profession, and urged him rather to take up the study of medicine. This advice Bernard followed, and in due course he became &quot;interne&quot; at the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris. In this way he was brought into contact with the great physiologist, François Magendie, who served as physician at the hospital. Bernard became &#x27;preparateur&#x27; (lab assistant) at the in 1841.

In 1845, Bernard married Marie Françoise &quot;Fanny&quot; Martin for convenience; the marriage was arranged by a colleague and her dowry helped finance his experiments. In 1847 he was appointed Magendie&#x27;s deputy-professor at the college, and in 1855 he succeeded him as full professor. In 1860, Bernard was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society. His field of research was considered inferior at the time, the laboratory assigned to him was simply a &quot;regular cellar.&quot; Some time previously Bernard had been chosen to be the first occupant of the newly instituted chair of physiology at the Sorbonne, but no laboratory was provided for his use. It was Louis Napoleon who, after an interview with him in 1864, repaired the deficiency, building a laboratory at the Muséum national d&#x27;Histoire naturelle in the Jardin des Plantes. At the same time, Napoleon III established a professorship which Bernard accepted, leaving the Sorbonne.
In the same year, 1868, he was also admitted a member of the &quot;Académie française&quot; and elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

When he died on 10 February 1878, he was accorded a public funeral – an honor which had never before been bestowed by France on a man of science. He was interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==&quot;Arthur de Bretagne&quot;==
At the age of 19 Claude Bernard wrote an autobiographical prose play in five acts called &quot;Arthur de Bretagne&quot;, which was published only after his death. A second edition appeared in 1943.

== Works ==

Patron Claude Bernard&#x27;s aim, as he stated in his own words, was to establish the use of the scientific method in medicine. He dismissed several previous misconceptions, questioned common presumptions, and relied on experimentation.

Claude Bernard&#x27;s first important work was on the functions of the pancreas, the juice of which he proved to be of great significance in the process of digestion; this achievement won him the prize for experimental physiology from the French Academy of Sciences.

A second investigation – perhaps his most famous – was on the glycogenic function of the liver; in the course of his study he was led to the conclusion, which throws light on the causation of diabetes mellitus, that the liver, in addition to secreting bile, is the seat of an internal secretion, by which it prepares sugar at the expense of the elements of the blood passing through it.

A third research resulted in the discovery of the vasomotor system. In 1851, while examining the effects produced in the temperature of various parts of the body by section of the nerve or nerves belonging to them, he noticed that division of the cervical sympathetic nerve gave rise to more active circulation and more forcible pulsation of the arteries in certain parts of the head, and a few months afterwards he observed that electrical excitation of the upper portion of the divided nerve had the contrary effect. In this way he established the existence of both vasodilator and vasoconstrictor nerves.

The study of the physiological action of poisons was also of great interest to him, his attention being devoted in particular to curare and carbon monoxide gas. Bernard is widely credited with first describing carbon monoxide&#x27;s affinity for hemoglobin in 1857, although James Watt had drawn similar conclusions about hydrocarbonate&#x27;s affinity for blood acting as &quot;an antidote to the oxygen&quot; in 1794 prior to the discoveries of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin.

=== Milieu intérieur ===
Milieu intérieur is the key concept with which Bernard is associated. He wrote, &quot;The stability of the internal environment [the &quot;milieu intérieur&quot;] is the condition for the free and independent life.&quot; This is the underlying principle of what would later be called homeostasis, a term coined by Walter Cannon. He also explained that:
The living body, though it has need of the surrounding environment, is nevertheless relatively independent of it. This independence which the organism has of its external environment, derives from the fact that in the living being, the tissues are in fact withdrawn from direct external influences and are protected by a veritable internal environment which is constituted, in particular, by the fluids circulating in the body.

The constancy of the internal environment is the condition for free and independent life: the mechanism that makes it possible is that which assured the maintenance, within the internal environment, of all the conditions necessary for the life of the elements.

The constancy of the environment presupposes a perfection of the organism such that external variations are at every instant compensated and brought into balance. In consequence, far from being indifferent to the external world, the higher animal is on the contrary in a close and wise relation with it, so that its equilibrium results from a continuous and delicate compensation established as if the most sensitive of balances.
=== Vivisection ===
Bernard&#x27;s scientific discoveries were made through vivisection, of which he was the primary proponent in Europe at the time. He wrote:

:The physiologist is no ordinary man. He is a learned man, a man possessed and absorbed by a scientific idea. He does not hear the animals&#x27; cries of pain. He is blind to the blood that flows. He sees nothing but his idea, and organisms which conceal from him the secrets he is resolved to discover.

Bernard practiced vivisection, to the disgust of his wife and daughters who had returned at home to discover that he had vivisected their dog. The couple was officially separated in 1869 and his wife went on to actively campaign against the practice of vivisection.

His wife and daughters were not the only ones disgusted by Bernard&#x27;s animal experiments. The physician-scientist George Hoggan spent four months observing and working in Bernard&#x27;s laboratory and was one of the few contemporary authors to chronicle what went on there. He was later moved to write that his experiences in Bernard&#x27;s lab had made him &quot;prepared to see not only science, but even mankind, perish rather than have recourse to such means of saving it.&quot;

== &quot;Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine&quot; ==
In his major discourse on the scientific method, &quot;An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine&quot; (1865), Bernard described what makes a scientific theory good and what makes a scientist important, a true discoverer. Unlike many scientific writers of his time, Bernard wrote about his own experiments and thoughts, and used the first person.

&quot;Known and Unknown&quot;. What makes a scientist important, he states, is how well he or she has penetrated into the unknown. In areas of science where the facts are known to everyone, all scientists are more or less equal—we cannot know who is great. But in the area of science that is still obscure and unknown the great are recognized: &quot;They are marked by ideas which light up phenomena hitherto obscure and carry science forward.&quot;

&quot;Authority vs. Observation&quot;. It is through the experimental method that science is carried forward—not through uncritically accepting the authority of academic or scholastic sources. In the experimental method, observable reality is our only authority. Bernard writes with scientific fervor:

:When we meet a fact which contradicts a prevailing theory, we must accept the fact and abandon the theory, even when the theory is supported by great names and generally accepted.

&quot;Induction and Deduction&quot;. Experimental science is a constant interchange between theory and fact, induction and deduction. Induction, reasoning from the particular to the general, and deduction, or reasoning from the general to the particular, are never truly separate. A general theory and our theoretical deductions from it must be tested with specific experiments designed to confirm or deny their truth; while these particular experiments may lead us to formulate new theories.

&quot;Cause and Effect&quot;. The scientist tries to determine the relation of cause and effect. This is true for all sciences: the goal is to connect a &quot;natural phenomenon&quot; with its &quot;immediate cause&quot;. We formulate hypotheses elucidating, as we see it, the relation of cause and effect for particular phenomena. We test the hypotheses. And when an hypothesis is proved, it is a scientific theory. &quot;Before that we have only groping and empiricism.&quot;

&quot;Verification and Disproof&quot;. Bernard explains what makes a theory good or bad scientifically:

:Theories are only hypotheses, verified by more or less numerous facts. Those verified by the most facts are the best, but even then they are never final, never to be absolutely believed.

When have we verified that we have found a cause? Bernard states:

:Indeed, proof that a given condition always precedes or accompanies a phenomenon does not warrant concluding with certainty that a given condition is the immediate cause of that phenomenon. It must still be established that when this condition is removed, the phenomenon will no longer appear…

We must always try to disprove our own theories. &quot;We can solidly settle our ideas only by trying to destroy our own conclusions by counter-experiments.&quot; What is observably true is the only authority. If through experiment, you contradict your own conclusions—you must accept the contradiction—but only on one condition: that the contradiction is PROVED.

&quot;Determinism and Averages&quot;. In the study of disease, &quot;the real and effective cause of a disease must be constant and determined, that is, unique; anything else would be a denial of science in medicine.&quot; In fact, a &quot;very frequent application of mathematics to biology [is] the use of averages&quot;—that is, statistics—which may give only &quot;apparent accuracy&quot;. Sometimes averages do not give the kind of information needed to save lives. For example:

:A great surgeon performs operations for stone by a single method; later he makes a statistical summary of deaths and recoveries, and he concludes from these statistics that the mortality law for this operation is two out of five. Well, I say that this ratio means literally nothing scientifically and gives us no certainty in performing the next operation; for we do not know whether the next case will be among the recoveries or the deaths. What really should be done, instead of gathering facts empirically, is to study them more accurately, each in its special determinism….to discover in them the cause of mortal accidents so as to master the cause and avoid the accidents.

Although the application of mathematics to every aspect of science is its ultimate goal, biology is still too complex and poorly understood. Therefore, for now the goal of medical science should be to discover all the new facts possible. Qualitative analysis must always precede quantitative analysis.

&quot;Truth vs. Falsification&quot;. The &quot;philosophic spirit&quot;, writes Bernard, is always active in its desire for truth. It stimulates a &quot;kind of thirst for the unknown&quot; which ennobles and enlivens science—where, as experimenters, we need &quot;only to stand face to face with nature&quot;. The minds that are great &quot;are never self-satisfied, but still continue to strive.&quot; Among the great minds he names Joseph Priestley and Blaise Pascal.

Meanwhile, there are those whose &quot;minds are bound and cramped&quot;. They oppose discovering the unknown (which &quot;is generally an unforeseen relation not included in theory&quot;) because they do not want to discover anything that might disprove their own theories. Bernard calls them &quot;despisers of their fellows&quot; and says &quot;the dominant idea of these despisers of their fellows is to find others&#x27; theories faulty and try to contradict them.&quot; They are deceptive, for in their experiments they report only results that make their theories seem correct and suppress results that support their rivals. In this way, they &quot;falsify science and the facts&quot;:

:They make poor observations, because they choose among the results of their experiments only what suits their object, neglecting whatever is unrelated to it and carefully setting aside everything which might tend toward the idea they wish to combat.

&quot;Discovering vs. Despising&quot;. The &quot;despisers of their fellows&quot; lack the &quot;ardent desire for knowledge&quot; that the true scientific spirit will always have—and so the progress of science will never be stopped by them. Bernard writes:

:Ardent desire for knowledge, in fact, is the one motive attracting and supporting investigators in their efforts; and just this knowledge, really grasped and yet always flying before them, becomes at once their sole torment and their sole happiness….A man of science rises ever, in seeking truth; and if he never finds it in its wholeness, he discovers nevertheless very significant fragments; and these fragments of universal truth are precisely what constitutes science.

<text>The Confederate Army of the Potomac, whose name was short-lived, was under the command of Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard in the early days of the American Civil War. Its only major combat action was the First Battle of Bull Run. Afterwards, the Army of the Shenandoah was merged into the Army of the Potomac with Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, the commander of the Shenandoah, taking command. The Army of the Potomac was renamed the Army of Northern Virginia on March 14, 1862, with Beauregard&#x27;s original army eventually becoming the First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia.

==History==
The army was formed from Confederate units defending northeastern Virginia, which arrived over the course of April to July 1861. Philip St. George Cocke was appointed to command the area of Virginia along &quot;the line of the Potomac&quot; and to muster the local militia companies into Confederate service. Regiments from Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina also arrived in Virginia and were assigned to Cocke&#x27;s command. On May 21, Cocke was replaced in command in northeastern Virginia by Milledge L. Bonham, who was in turn superseded by P. G. T. Beauregard ten days later. Beauregard divided his army into six brigades (two of which were commanded by Cocke and Bonham) and concentrated them along the south bank of Bull Run, intending to defend the rail center of Manassas Junction. He would be reinforced by additional regiments over the next few weeks, forming a seventh brigade, and received the brigade of Theophilus H. Holmes as well.

Over the course of his first weeks in command, Beauregard sent to Confederate president Jefferson Davis various plans for an offensive against Union forces in northern Virginia, which usually involved coordination with Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s Army of the Shenandoah. Both Davis and his military advisor, Robert E. Lee, rejected these plans as being impractical. On July 18, as forces from the Union Army of Northeastern Virginia commanded by Irvin McDowell advanced to within a few miles of Beauregard&#x27;s positions, the Confederate War Department ordered Johnston to transfer his army to reinforce Beauregard; his army arrived by rail over the next few days. Johnston was the senior officer present and had overall command of the combined Confederate armies. Beauregard had drawn up plans for an attack on the Union left wing across Bull Run and convinced Johnston to approve the plan. Johnston deferred the issuing of orders to Beauregard since he was more familiar with the terrain.

During the First Battle of Bull Run, which occurred on July 21, Colonel Nathan Evans&#x27; brigade from the Army of the Potomac began the opening stages of the fighting on Matthews Hill, reinforced by two brigades from Johnston&#x27;s army. As the fighting shifted to Henry House Hill, Cocke&#x27;s and Jubal Early&#x27;s brigades along with units from Bonham&#x27;s brigade from Beauregard&#x27;s army, along with the rest of Johnston&#x27;s army, were shifted to the Confederate left wing. An attack by Early&#x27;s brigade on the Union right flank at about 4 p.m. helped drive the Union army from the field. Beauregard&#x27;s brigades lost fewer men than Johnston&#x27;s brigades, but some commands still suffered a casualty rate as high as twenty percent.

Most of Beauregard&#x27;s brigades remained on the Confederate right, since Beauregard still hoped to launch an attack on the Union left wing. However, because of contradictory and confusing orders, some of which apparently were never delivered to the intended recipients, the attack was never launched. The brigades on this part of the field never fought at all or participated in only minor skirmishing. David R. Jones and James Longstreet crossed Bull Run and attempted to organize an attack but following a brief skirmish Jones&#x27; brigade was thrown back due to heavy artillery fire. Both brigades subsequently withdrew back to Bull Run.

The two Confederate armies were consolidated into a single army following the battle, retaining the name &quot;Army of the Potomac&quot; and with Johnston in command; Beauregard was initially posted as its second-in-command but he was soon transferred to the Western Theater. The army was spread through northern Virginia to observe the Union Army of the Potomac in Washington, fighting several small skirmishes including the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff. In the spring of 1862, Johnston&#x27;s army was transferred to the Richmond area, where the Army of the Peninsula and the Confederate garrison of Norfolk, Virginia, were incorporated into the army. At this time in the Peninsula Campaign, the army was officially renamed the Army of Northern Virginia, although Johnston continued to use the name Army of the Potomac until he was wounded.

<doc id="376954" wikidata="Q7721121" url="?curid=376954" title="The Campus Murders">
<text>The Campus Murders is a 1969 paperback mystery novel by Ellery Queen, ghostwritten by Gil Brewer (1922–1983). Frederic Dannay and his cousin Manfred B. Lee created the Ellery Queen pseudonym and wrote most of the Queen novels, but in their later years they sometimes used ghostwriters. That was especially true for novels, such as this one, that did not feature the fictional sleuth Ellery Queen. &quot;The Campus Murders&quot; is the first of three novels—each ghostwritten by a different author—to feature &quot;troubleshooter&quot; Mike McCall, a U.S. governor&#x27;s special assistant.

In &quot;The Campus Murders&quot;, McCall is sent to Tisquanto State College to investigate the disappearance of a female student. Rather than for its largely predictable plot, the novel is remarkable for its depiction of late 1960s student life. McCall, who is in his early thirties, is confronted with radical, violent, long-haired, dirty, drug-taking, and promiscuous students on the one hand and, on the other, traditional faculty members who are unable to understand what is going on around campus and who do not know how to react to the demands voiced by hippies and yippies.

==Plot summary==

Against the background of a student rebellion, two murders are committed on the Tisquanto State College campus. The first victim is one of the conservative deans, who is stabbed after his life-size effigy has been burned on a stake specially erected by a group of students. The second victim is a female student whose body is found dangling from a rope in the campus bell tower. The missing student is found near a river, severely beaten up and in a coma. The investigation ultimately yields some surprises about the perpetrator and the motive.

<text>The Cotton Club was a 20th-century nightclub in New York City. It was located on 142nd Street and Lenox Avenue from 1923 to 1936, then briefly in the midtown Theater District until 1940. The club operated during the United States&#x27; era of Prohibition and Jim Crow era racial segregation. Black people initially could not patronize the Cotton Club, but the venue featured many of the most popular black entertainers of the era, including musicians Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Chick Webb, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Fats Waller, Willie Bryant; vocalists Adelaide Hall, Ethel Waters, Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, Lillie Delk Christian, Aida Ward, Avon Long, the Dandridge Sisters, the Will Vodery choir, The Mills Brothers, Nina Mae McKinney, Billie Holiday, Midge Williams, Lena Horne, and dancers such as Katherine Dunham, Bill Robinson, The Nicholas Brothers, Charles &#x27;Honi&#x27; Coles, Leonard Reed, Stepin Fetchit, the Berry Brothers, The Four Step Brothers, Jeni Le Gon and Earl Snakehips Tucker.

In its prime, the Cotton Club served as a hip meeting spot, with regular &quot;Celebrity Nights&quot; on Sundays featuring guests including Jimmy Durante, George Gershwin, Sophie Tucker, Paul Robeson, Al Jolson, Mae West, Richard Rodgers, Irving Berlin, Eddie Cantor, Fanny Brice, Langston Hughes, Judy Garland, Moss Hart, and Jimmy Walker.
== History ==
In 1920, heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson rented the upper floor of the building on the corner of 142nd Street and Lenox Avenue in the heart of Harlem and opened an intimate supper club called the Club Deluxe. Owney Madden, a prominent bootlegger and gangster, acquired the club following his release from Sing Sing Correctional Facility in 1923, and the venue&#x27;s name was changed to the Cotton Club. The two arranged a deal that allowed Johnson to remain the club&#x27;s manager. Madden &quot;used the Cotton Club as an outlet to sell his #1 beer to the prohibition crowd&quot;.

When the club closed briefly in 1925 for selling liquor, it soon reopened without interference from the police. An extensive drink list continued to be available on the Cotton Club menu and sold to white guests following the shut down. Herman Stark then became the stage manager. Harlem producer Leonard Harper directed the first two of three opening night floor-shows at the new venue.
The Cotton Club was a whites-only establishment with rare exceptions for black celebrities such as Ethel Waters and Bill Robinson. It reproduced the racist imagery of the era, often depicting black people as savages in exotic jungles or as &quot;darkies&quot; in the plantation South. A 1938 menu included this imagery, with illustrations done by Julian Harrison, showing naked black men and women dancing around a drum in the jungle. Tribal mask illustrations make up the border of the menu.

The club imposed a subtler color line on the chorus girls, whom the club presented in skimpy outfits. They were expected to be &quot;tall, tan, and terrific&quot;, which meant they had to be at least 5&#x27;6&quot; tall, light-skinned, and under 21 years of age. The male dancers&#x27;, the Cotton Club Boys, skin colors were more varied. &quot;Black performers did not mix with the club&#x27;s clientele, and after the show many of them went next door to the basement of the superintendent at 646 Lenox, where they imbibed corn whiskey, peach brandy, and marijuana.&quot;

Ellington was expected to write &quot;jungle music&quot; for a white audience; Ellington&#x27;s contributions to the Cotton Club were priceless, as described in this 1937 &quot;New York Times&quot; excerpt: &quot;So long may the empirical Duke and his music making roosters reign—and long may the Cotton Club continue to remember that it came down from Harlem&quot;. Entrance was expensive for customers, and it included a two dollar minimum cover fee on weekdays for food and drink, so the performers were well-compensated.

===The Harlem years===
Shows at the Cotton Club were musical revues, and several were called &quot;Cotton Club Parade&quot; followed by the year. Musical revues were created twice a year in hopes of becoming successful Broadway shows. The revues featured dancers, singers, comedians, and variety acts, as well as a house band. These revues helped launch the careers of many artists, including Andy Preer, who led the Cotton Club&#x27;s first house band in 1923. Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra was the house band from December 4, 1927, until June 30, 1931.

The first revue that Ellington&#x27;s orchestra performed was called the &quot;Creole Revue&quot; and featured Adelaide Hall. Hall had just recorded several songs with Ellington, including &quot;Creole Love Call&quot;, a worldwide hit. The club gave Ellington national exposure through radio broadcasts originating there, first over WHN, then over WEAF, and after September 1929 on Fridays over the NBC Red Network, for which WEAF was the flagship station.

The club also enabled him to develop his repertoire while composing dance tunes for the shows as well as overtures, transitions, accompaniments, and &quot;jungle&quot; effects, giving him a freedom to experiment with orchestral arrangements that touring bands rarely experienced. Ellington recorded more than 100 compositions during this period. Eventually, responding to Ellington&#x27;s request, the club slightly relaxed its policy of segregation.

Cab Calloway&#x27;s orchestra brought its &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; revue to the club on September 28, 1930, replacing Ellington&#x27;s orchestra after its departure on February 4, 1931. Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s band replaced Calloway&#x27;s in 1934. Ellington, Calloway, and Louis Armstrong returned to perform at the club in later years. Lena Horne (Leona Laviscount) began at the Cotton Club as a chorus girl at the age of sixteen, and sang &quot;Sweeter than Sweet&quot; with Calloway. Dorothy Dandridge performed at the club while part of the Dandridge Sisters, and Coleman Hawkins and Don Redman played at the club as part of Henderson&#x27;s band. Tap dancers Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, Sammy Davis Jr. (as part of the Will Mastin Trio), and the Nicholas Brothers performed at the club as well.

Another notable &quot;Cotton Club Parade&quot; in 1933 featured Ethel Waters, and Duke Ellington performing Stormy Weather. Later this performance would also include Lena Horne, and Katherine Dunham in the film adaptation of Stormy Weather. The club also drew from white popular culture. Walter Brooks, who had produced the successful Broadway show &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;, was the club&#x27;s nominal owner. Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh, one of the most prominent songwriting teams of the era, and Harold Arlen wrote the songs for the revues, one of which, &quot;Blackbirds of 1928&quot;, starring Adelaide Hall, featured the songs &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything But Love&quot; and &quot;Diga Diga Doo&quot;, produced by Lew Leslie on Broadway.

In 1934, Hall starred in the &quot;Cotton Club Parade 1934&quot;, the highest-grossing show ever to appear at the club. The show opened on March 11, 1934, and ran for six months, attracting over 600,000 paying customers. The score was written by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler and featured the classic song &quot;Ill Wind&quot;. During Hall&#x27;s performance of &quot;Ill Wind&quot;, a dry-ice machine was used to create a fog effect, the first time such equipment had been used on a stage. Sixteen-year-old Lena Horne was also featured on the bill. After appearing at the Cotton Club the entire show starring Adelaide Hall was taken out on a road tour across America.

===The Midtown years===
The club closed temporarily in 1936 after the race riot in Harlem the previous year. Carl Van Vechten had vowed to boycott the club for having in place such racist policies as refusing entry to African Americans. The Cotton Club reopened later that year at Broadway and 48th. The site chosen for the new Cotton Club was a big room on the top floor of a building where Broadway and Seventh Avenue meet, an important midtown crossroads at the center of the Great White Way, the Broadway Theater District.

Stark and the club&#x27;s owners were quite certain the club would succeed in this new location, but they realized that success depended on a popular opening show. A 1937 &quot;New York Times&quot; article states, &quot;The Cotton Club has climbed aboard the Broadway bandwagon, with a show that is calculated to give the customers their money&#x27;s worth of sound and color—and it does.&quot;

The most extravagant revue in the club&#x27;s 13-year history opened on September 24, 1936, with Robinson and Calloway leading a roster of approximately 130 performers. Stark paid Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson $3,500 a week, the highest salary ever paid to a black entertainer in a Broadway production and a higher salary than had ever been paid to any nightclub entertainer.

In June 1935, the Cotton Club opened its doors to black patrons. In preparation for the Joe Louis fight the club planned a gala and, &quot;extended an open invitation to the Sepians.&quot; That same year, the club was forced to close its doors due to the Harlem race riot, only to reopen one year later at Broadway and 48th Street. Calloway and Robinson were the house act and were paid $3,500 per week (which was reportedly the most ever paid to a nightclub performer at the time).

The club closed permanently in 1940 under pressure from higher rents, changing taste, and a federal investigation into the alleged tax evasion of Manhattan nightclub owners. The Latin Quarter nightclub opened in its space and the building was torn down in 1989 to build a hotel. The Broadway Cotton Club successfully blended the old and new; the site was new and the décor was slightly different, but once a customer was seated it felt like a familiar place.

=== Langston Hughes&#x27; critique ===
Madden&#x27;s goal for the Cotton Club was to provide &quot;an authentic black entertainment to a wealthy, whites-only audience.&quot; Langston Hughes, a key figure of the Harlem Renaissance, attended the Cotton Club as a rare black customer. Following his visit, Hughes criticized the club&#x27;s segregated atmosphere and commented that it was &quot;a Jim Crow club for gangsters and monied whites.&quot;

In addition to the &quot;jungle music&quot; and plantation-themed interior, Hughes believed that Madden&#x27;s idea of &quot;authentic black entertainment&quot; was similar to the entertainment provided at a zoo and that white &quot;strangers were given the best ringside tables to sit and stare at the Negro customers - like amusing animals in a zoo.&quot;

Hughes also believed that the Cotton Club negatively affected the Harlem community. The club brought an &quot;influx of whites toward Harlem after sundown, flooding the little cabarets and bars where formerly only colored people laughed and sang.&quot; Hughes also mentioned how many of the neighboring cabarets, especially black cabarets, were forced to close due to the competition from the Cotton Club. These smaller clubs did not have large floors or music by famous entertainers such as Ellington.

===Other &quot;Cotton Clubs&quot;===

An incarnation of the Cotton Club opened on 125th Street in Harlem in 1978. James Haskins wrote at the time, &quot;Today, there is a new incarnation of the Cotton Club that sits on the most western end of the 125th Street under the massive Manhattanville viaduct. The windowless block of a building has a less dramatic display out front but seems to be popular with tourists for Sunday jazz brunches.&quot;

A Chicago branch of the Cotton Club was run by Ralph Capone, and a California branch was located in Culver City during the late 1920s and early 1930s, featuring performers from the original Cotton Club such as Armstrong, Calloway, and Ellington.

Cotton Clubs in Las Vegas, Portland, Oregon, Lubbock, Texas, and  Colorado Springs were all different locations of other Cotton Clubs. The Lubbock club was opened on November 11, 1938, by Tommy Hancock, and was an integrated club, not unlike the Chicago club. The club in Lubbock, however, was home to more white artists than the Harlem club. The Cotton Club in Portland was opened by Paul Knauls in 1963. The club in Las Vegas was opened by Moe Taub in 1944. This location differed from other clubs because it was a casino. Taub opened the club to black servicemen.

==In popular culture==

The &quot;Cotton Club Gala&quot;, which featured some of the club&#x27;s original dancers, was produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club twice in 1975 and again in 1985. The 1985 production was directed by La MaMa founder Ellen Stewart. La MaMa also toured Europe with the &quot;Cotton Club Gala&quot; in 1976.

&quot;The Cotton Club Comes to the Ritz&quot; (1985) starring Adelaide Hall, Cab Calloway, Doc Cheatham, The Nicholas Brothers etc. Produced by BBC TV.

In the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, the fictional Ink and Paint Club is based on the Cotton Club.

&quot;After Midnight&quot; is a 2013 Broadway musical revue about the music created during Duke Ellington&#x27;s years at the Cotton Club.

<text>Wendell Phillips (November 29, 1811 – February 2, 1884) was an American abolitionist, advocate for Native Americans, orator, and attorney.

According to George Lewis Ruffin, a Black attorney, Phillips was seen by many Black people as &quot;the one white American wholly color-blind and free from race prejudice&quot;. According to another Black attorney, Archibald Grimké, as an abolitionist leader he is ahead of William Lloyd Garrison and Charles Sumner. From 1850 to 1865 he was the &quot;preeminent figure&quot; in American abolitionism.

== Early life and education ==
Phillips was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on November 29, 1811, to Sarah Walley and John Phillips, a wealthy lawyer, politician, and philanthropist, who was the first mayor of Boston. He was a descendant of Reverend George Phillips, who emigrated from England to Watertown, Massachusetts, in 1630. All of his ancestors migrated to North America from England, and all of them arrived in Massachusetts between the years 1630 and 1650.

Phillips was schooled at Boston Latin School, and graduated from Harvard College in 1831. He went on to attend Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1833. In 1834, Phillips was admitted to the Massachusetts state bar, and in the same year, he opened a law practice in Boston.

== Marriage to Ann Terry Greene ==
In 1836, Phillips was supporting the abolitionist cause when he met Ann Greene. It was her opinion that this cause required not just support but total commitment. Phillips and Greene were engaged that year and Greene declared Wendell to be her &quot;best three quarters&quot;. They were married until Wendell&#x27;s death, 46 years later.

== Abolitionism ==
On October 21, 1835, the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society announced that British abolitionist George Thompson would be speaking. Pro-slavery forces posted nearly 500 notices of a $100 reward for the citizen that would first lay violent hands on him. Thompson canceled at the last minute, and Wm. Lloyd Garrison, editor and publisher of the abolitionist newspaper The Liberator, was quickly scheduled to speak in his place. A lynch mob formed, forcing Garrison to escape through the back of the hall and hide in a carpenter&#x27;s shop. The mob soon found him, putting a noose around his neck to drag him away. Several strong men, including the mayor, intervened and took him to the most secure place in Boston, the Leverett Street Jail. Phillips, watching from nearby Court Street, was a witness to the attempted lynching.

After being converted to the abolitionist cause by Garrison in 1836, Phillips stopped practicing law in order to dedicate himself to the movement. Phillips joined the American Anti-Slavery Society and frequently made speeches at its meetings. So highly regarded were Phillips&#x27; oratorical abilities that he was known as &quot;abolition&#x27;s golden trumpet&quot;. Like many of Phillips&#x27; fellow abolitionists who honored the free-produce movement, he condemned the purchase of cane sugar and clothing made of cotton, since both were produced by the labor of slaves. He was a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization that assisted fugitive slaves in avoiding slavecatchers.
It was Phillips&#x27;s contention that racial injustice was the source of all of society&#x27;s ills. Like Garrison, Phillips denounced the Constitution for tolerating slavery. He disagreed with abolitionist Lysander Spooner and maintained that slavery was part of the Constitution, and more generally disputed Spooner&#x27;s notion that any judge could find slavery illegal.

In 1845, in an essay titled &quot;No Union With Slaveholders&quot;, he argued that the country would be better off, and not complicit in their guilt, if it let the slave states secede:

The experience of the fifty years...shows us the slaves trebling in numbers—slaveholders monopolizing the offices and dictating the policy of the Government—prostituting the strength and influence of the Nation to the support of slavery here and elsewhere—trampling on the rights of the free States, and making the courts of the country their tools. To continue this disastrous alliance longer is madness. The trial of fifty years only proves that it is impossible for free and slave States to unite on any terms, without all becoming partners in the guilt and responsible for the sin of slavery. Why prolong the experiment? Let every honest man join in the outcry of the American Anti-Slavery Society. (Quoted in Ruchames, &quot;The Abolitionists&quot; p. 196)

On December 8, 1837, in Boston&#x27;s Faneuil Hall, Phillips&#x27; leadership and oratory established his preeminence within the abolitionist movement. Bostonians gathered at Faneuil Hall to discuss Elijah P. Lovejoy&#x27;s murder by a mob outside his abolitionist newspaper&#x27;s office in Alton, Illinois, on November 7. Lovejoy died defending himself and his press from pro-slavery rioters who set fire to a warehouse storing his press and shot Lovejoy as he stepped outside to tip a ladder being used by the mob. His death engendered a national controversy between abolitionists and anti-abolitionists.

At Faneuil Hall, Massachusetts attorney general James T. Austin defended the pro-slavery mob, comparing their actions to 1776 patriots who fought against the British and declaring that Lovejoy &quot;died as the fool dieth!&quot;

==Trip to Europe==
The married couple went abroad in 1839 for two years. They spent the summer in Great Britain and the rest of each year in mainland Europe. They made important connections and Ann wrote of them meeting Elizabeth Pease and being particularly impressed by the Quaker abolitionist Richard D. Webb. In 1840 they went to London to join up with other American delegates to the World Anti-Slavery Convention at the Exeter Hall in London. Phillips&#x27; new wife was one of a number of female delegates, who included Lucretia Mott, Mary Grew, Sarah Pugh, Abby Kimber, Elizabeth Neall and Emily Winslow. The delegates were astounded to find that female delegates had not been expected and they were not welcome at the convention.

Instructed by his wife not to &quot;shilly-shally&quot;, Phillips went in to appeal the case. According to the history of the women&#x27;s rights movement of Susan B. Anthony&#x27;s and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Phillips spoke as the convention opened, scolding the organizers for precipitating an unnecessary conflict:

The efforts of Phillips and others were only partly successful. The women were allowed in but had to sit separately and were not allowed to talk. This event has been taken by Stanton, Anthony, and others as the point at which the women&#x27;s rights movement began.

==Before the Civil War==
In 1854, Phillips was indicted for his participation in the celebrated attempt to rescue Anthony Burns, a captured fugitive slave, from a jail in Boston. 

After John Brown was executed in December 1859, Phillips attended and spoke at his funeral, at the John Brown Farm in remote North Elba, New York. He met Mary Brown and the coffin in Troy, New York, where she changed trains, and expressed, unsuccessfully, his wish that Brown would be buried, with a monument, in Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which he felt would help the abolitionist cause. He spoke at the funeral and on the way home, repeated his speech the next night to a wildly enthusiastic audience in Vergennes, Vermont.

On the eve of the Civil War, Phillips gave a speech at the New Bedford Lyceum in which he defended the Confederate States&#x27; right to secede:

In 1860 and 1861, many abolitionists welcomed the formation of the Confederacy because it would end the South&#x27;s stranglehold over the United States government. This position was rejected by nationalists like Abraham Lincoln, who insisted on holding the Union together while gradually ending slavery. Twelve days after the attack on Fort Sumter, Phillips announced his &quot;hearty and hot&quot; support for the war. Disappointed with what he regarded as Lincoln&#x27;s slow action, Phillips opposed his reelection in 1864, breaking with Garrison, who supported a candidate for the first time.

In the mid-1862, Phillips&#x27;s nephew, Samuel D. Phillips, died at Port Royal, South Carolina, where he had gone to take part in the so-called Port Royal Experiment to assist the slave population there in the transition to freedom.

== Women&#x27;s rights activism ==
Phillips was also an early advocate of women&#x27;s rights. In 1840 he led the unsuccessful effort at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London to have America&#x27;s women delegates seated. In the July 3, 1846, issue of &quot;The Liberator&quot; he called for securing women&#x27;s rights to their property and earnings as well as to the ballot. He wrote:

In 1849 and 1850, he assisted Lucy Stone in conducting the first woman suffrage petition campaign in Massachusetts, drafting for her both the petition and an appeal for signatures. They repeated the effort the following two years, sending several hundred signatures to the state legislature. In 1853, they directed their petition to a convention charged with revising the state constitution, and sent it petitions bearing five thousand signatures. Together Phillips and Stone addressed the convention&#x27;s Committee on Qualifications of Voters on May 27, 1853. In 1854, Phillips helped Stone call a New England Woman&#x27;s Rights convention to expand suffrage petitioning into the other New England states.

Phillips was a member of the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Central Committee, which organized annual conventions throughout the 1850s, published its Proceedings, and executed plans adopted by the conventions. He was a close adviser of Lucy Stone, and a major presence at most of the conventions, for which he wrote resolutions defining the movement&#x27;s principles and goals. His address to the 1851 convention, later called &quot;Freedom for Woman&quot;, was used as a women&#x27;s rights tract into the twentieth century. In March 1857, Phillips and Stone were granted hearings by the Massachusetts and Maine legislatures on the woman suffrage memorial sent to twenty-five legislatures by the 1856 National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention. As the movement&#x27;s treasurer, Phillips was trustee with Lucy Stone and Susan B. Anthony of a $5,000 fund given anonymously to the movement in 1858, called the &quot;Phillips fund&quot; until the death of the benefactor, Francis Jackson, in 1861, and thereafter the &quot;Jackson Fund&quot;.

== Postwar activism ==

Phillips&#x27;s philosophical ideal was mainly self-control of the animal, physical self by the human, rational mind, although he admired martyrs like Elijah Lovejoy and John Brown. Historian Gilbert Osofsky has argued that Phillips&#x27;s nationalism was shaped by a religious ideology derived from the European Enlightenment, as expressed by Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton. The Puritan ideal of a Godly Commonwealth through a pursuit of Christian morality and justice, however, was the main influence on Phillips&#x27;s nationalism. He favored getting rid of American slavery by letting the slave states secede, and he sought to amalgamate all the American &quot;races&quot;. Thus, it was the moral end which mattered most in Phillips&#x27;s nationalism.

=== Reconstruction Era activism ===
As Northern victory in the Civil War seemed more imminent, Phillips, like many other abolitionists, turned his attention to the questions of Reconstruction. In 1864, he gave a speech at the Cooper Institute in New York arguing that enfranchisement of freedmen should be a necessary condition for the readmission of Southern states to the Union. Unlike other white abolitionist leaders such as Garrison, Phillips thought that securing civil and political rights for freedmen was an essential component of the abolitionist cause, even after the formal legal end of slavery. Along with Frederick Douglass, Phillips argued that without voting rights, the rights of freedmen would be &quot;ground to powder&quot; by white Southerners.

He lamented the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment without provisions for black suffrage, and fervently opposed the Reconstruction regime of President Andrew Johnson, affixing a new masthead to the &quot;National Anti-Slavery Standard&quot; newspaper which read &quot;Defeat the Amendment–Impeach the President.&quot; As Radical Republicans in Congress broke with Johnson and pursued their own Reconstruction policies through the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau bills and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, their views converged increasingly with Phillips&#x27;. However, most congressional Republicans disagreed with his assertion that &quot;suffrage is nothing but a name because the voter has not...an acre from which he could retire from the persecution of landlordism&quot;; in other words, Phillips and the Republicans diverged on the issue of land redistribution to the freedmen.

Despite his belief that Ulysses S. Grant was not suited for the presidential office and dissatisfaction with Grant&#x27;s and the party&#x27;s refusal to endorse his comprehensive Reconstruction program of &quot;land, education and the ballot&quot;, Phillips supported Grant and the Republican Party in the 1868 election. The Republicans did pass the Fifteenth Amendment constitutionalizing black suffrage in 1870, but the goal of land redistribution was never realized.

In 1879, Phillips argued that black suffrage and political participation during Reconstruction had not been a failure, and that the main error of the era had been the failure to redistribute land to the freedmen. He defended black voters as being &quot;less purchasable than the white man,&quot; credited black labor and rule for the nascent regrowth of the Southern economy, and commended black bravery against attacks from the first Ku Klux Klan.

As the Reconstruction era came to a close, Phillips increased his attention to other issues, such as women&#x27;s rights, universal suffrage, temperance, and the labor movement.

=== Equal rights for Native Americans ===
Phillips was also active in efforts to gain equal rights for Native Americans, arguing that the Fifteenth Amendment also granted citizenship to Indians. He proposed that the Andrew Johnson administration create a cabinet-level post that would guarantee Indian rights. Phillips helped create the Massachusetts Indian Commission with Indian rights activist Helen Hunt Jackson and Massachusetts governor William Claflin. Although publicly critical of President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s drinking, he worked with Grant&#x27;s second administration on the appointment of Indian agents. Phillips lobbied against military involvement in the settling of Native American problems on the Western frontier. He accused General Philip Sheridan of pursuing a policy of Indian extermination.

Public opinion turned against Native American advocates after the Battle of the Little Bighorn in July 1876, but Phillips continued to support the land claims of the Lakota (Sioux). During the 1870s, Phillips arranged public forums for reformer Alfred B. Meacham and Indians affected by the country&#x27;s Indian removal policy, including the Ponca chief Standing Bear, and the Omaha writer and speaker Susette LaFlesche Tibbles.

== Illness and death ==
By late January 1884, Phillips was suffering from heart disease. Phillips delivered his last public address on January 26, 1884, over the objections of his physician. Phillips spoke at the unveiling of a statue to Harriet Martineau. At the time of the speech, he said that he thought it would be his last.

Phillips died in his home, on Common Street in Boston&#x27;s neighborhood of Charlestown, on February 2, 1884.

A solemn funeral was held at Hollis Street Church four days later. His body was taken to Faneuil Hall, where it lay in state for several hours. Phillips was then buried at Granary Burying Ground. In April 1886, his remains were exhumed and reburied at Milton Cemetery in Milton.

On February 12, a memorial service was held at the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church on Sullivan Street in New York City. Rev. William B. Derrick gave a eulogy, describing Phillips as a friend of humanity and a citizen of the world. Timothy Thomas Fortune also eulogized Phillips, calling him a reformer who was as bold as a lion, who had reformed a great wrong, and who had left a rejuvenated Constitution.

On February 8, in the U.S. House of Representatives, John F. Finerty offered resolutions of respect to the memory of Phillips. William W. Eaton objected to the resolutions.

A memorial event was held in Tremont Temple, Boston, on April 9, 1884. Archibald Grimké delivered a eulogy.

Irish poet and journalist John Boyle O&#x27;Reilly, who was a good friend of Phillips, wrote the poem &quot;Wendell Phillips&quot; in his honor.

== Recognition and legacy ==

In 1904, the Chicago Public Schools opened Wendell Phillips High School in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the south side of Chicago in Phillips&#x27;s honor.

In July 1915, a monument was erected in Boston Public Garden to commemorate Phillips, inscribed with his words: &quot;Whether in chains or in laurels, liberty knows nothing but victories.&quot; Jonathan Harr&#x27;s &quot;A Civil Action&quot; refers to the statue in recounting Mark Phillips,&#x27; a descendant of Wendell Phillips,&#x27; reaction to a legal victory in the case against W.R. Grace &amp; Co. et al.

The Phillips community in Minneapolis was named after him.

A phrase from his speech of January 20, 1861, &quot;I think the first duty of society is justice,&quot; sometimes wrongly attributed to Alexander Hamilton, appears on various courthouses around the United States, including in Nashville, Tennessee.

The Wendell Phillips School in Washington, D.C., was named in his honor in 1890. The school closed in 1950 and was turned into the Phillips School Condominium in 2002.

<text>From 1939 to 1940, the French Third Republic was at war with Nazi Germany. In 1940, the German forces defeated the French in the Battle of France. The Germans occupied the north and west of French territory and a collaborationist régime under Philippe Pétain established itself in Vichy. General Charles de Gaulle established a government in exile in London and competed with Vichy France to position himself as the legitimate French government, for control of the French overseas empire and receiving help from French allies. He eventually managed to enlist the support of some French African colonies and later succeeded in bringing together the disparate &quot;maquis&quot;, colonial regiments, legionnaires, expatriate fighters, and Communist snipers under the Free French Forces in the Allied chain of command. In 1944, after the Allies had landed in Normandy and the southern front moved from North Africa across the Mediterranean into Italy and Provence, these forces routed the German Army, and Vichy officials fled into Germany.

France and Britain had both declared war on Germany two days after the invasion of Poland in September 1939. To divert German forces from Poland, France invaded the Saarland region of Germany on 7 September 1939, but was forced to retreat. The Phoney War ensued until 1940, when the Germans invaded and overran northern France, forcing the British from the continent. France formally surrendered. Germany sent two million French prisoners of war to forced labor camps in Germany.

In August 1943, the forces under de Gaulle and under Giraud merged into a single chain of command under Allied leadership. French forces on the Eastern Front had Soviet or German leadership. These forces of French exiles and the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) played varying roles in the liberation of France and the defeat of Vichy France, Nazi Germany, Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan. Control of the French colonial empire proved critical. Free French forces won control, helped by Britain and the United States, and used it to attack Nazi-occupied France. All French colonies except Indochina eventually joined the Free French. The number of Free French troops grew with their successes in North Africa and the invasion of Italy by the Army of Africa. The Allies demanded unconditional surrender from the Axis Powers at the Casablanca Conference. On 30 October 1944, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union officially recognized de Gaulle as head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF), and eventually as elected president of the French Fourth Republic. The GPRF stepped into the vacuum left when the Vichy administration fled to Sigmaringen in Germany. The outcome of the war resulted in a victory for France and its allies over Germany after the surrender of the Nazis in May 1945, ensuring the definitive victory for the Allied forces in Europe against the Axis Forces.

Recruitment in liberated France led to an expansion of the French armies. By the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, France had 1,250,000 troops, 10 divisions of which were fighting in Germany. An expeditionary corps was created to liberate French Indochina, then occupied by the Japanese. During the course of the war, French military losses totaled 212,000 dead, of whom 92,000 were killed through the end of the campaign of 1940, and 58,000 from 1940 to 1945 in other campaigns, 24,000 lost while serving in the French resistance, and a further 38,000 lost while serving with the German Army (including 32,000 &quot;malgré-nous&quot;).
==Military forces==


France had lots of armed forces in World War II, in part due to the German occupation. In 1940, General Maurice Gamelin commanded the French Army, headquartered in Vincennes on the outskirts of Paris. It consisted of 117 divisions, with 94 committed to the northeastern front and a commander, General Alphonse Georges, at La Ferte-sous-Jouarre. General Joseph Vuillemin commanded the French Air Force, headquartered in Coulommiers.

Following its disastrous loss in the 1940 Battle of France, the French Third Republic that had fought as one of the Allies fell into the hands of an authoritarian regime, Vichy France, that willingly collaborated with Germany and opposed the Allies. The Free French forces who opposed Vichy included the grassroots &quot;maquis&quot; (made of various rebel factions with ancient regional allegiances), a government in exile, and regiments from the French colonial empire, who at times found themselves fighting other French people.

French ground armies, navies, and air forces fought on the Allied side in each theater of World War II before, during, and after the Battle of France. Even though those forces participated in varying degrees, the Allies considered France a World War II victor and did not impose a planned US-run military occupation (AMGOT). However, United States Air Force bases were maintained in France until 1967, when Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s government rejected NATO.

French colonial units consisted of some non-French mercenaries from the Foreign Legion and conscripted indigenous people recruited by tribe, ethnicity, or region.

==Free French Forces (1940–1945)==


The Free French Forces were created in 1940 as a rebel army, refusing both the armistice with Germany and Vichy&#x27;s authority. Its allegiance was to General de Gaulle in London; later the headquarters moved to Algiers. The Forces started as a limited group of volunteers from metropolitan France, West African colonies, Belgium, and Spain. It evolved to a full army after its merger with Giraud&#x27;s Army of Africa, which had new recruits from the French Resistance.

===De Gaulle&#x27;s appeals on the BBC (June 1940)===
General Charles de Gaulle was a member of the French cabinet during the Battle of France in 1940. As French defence forces were increasingly overwhelmed, de Gaulle found himself part of a group of politicians who argued against surrender to Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The president of the council, Paul Reynaud, sent de Gaulle as an emissary to Britain, where de Gaulle was working when the French government collapsed.

On 18 June 1940, de Gaulle spoke to the French people on BBC Radio. He asked French soldiers, sailors, and airmen to join in the fight against the Nazis. De Gaulle&#x27;s &quot;Appel du 18 juin&quot; was not widely heard in France, but his subsequent discourse was heard nationwide. His speech remains one of the most famous orations in French history. Regardless, Pétain&#x27;s representative signed the armistice on 22 June and Pétain became leader of the new regime, known as Vichy France.

De Gaulle was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; for treason and desertion in Vichy France and sentenced to death. But de Gaulle regarded himself as the last remaining member of the legitimate Reynaud government able to exercise power. He saw Pétain&#x27;s rise to power as a coup d&#x27;état.

===French SAS (1942–1945)===
On 15 September 1940, Free French Captain Georges Bergé created the airborne unit called &quot;1re compagnie de l&#x27;air, 1re CIA&quot; (1st Marine Infantry Paratroopers Regiment) in Great Britain. This unit, later known as &quot;1re compagnie de chasseurs parachutistes, 1re CCP&quot; (1st Parachute Light Infantry Company) joined the British Special Air Service airborne unit with Charles de Gaulle in 1942, becoming the SAS Brigade&#x27;s French Squadron.

The 3rd SAS and 4th SAS are also known as 1st Airborne Marine Infantry Regiment (1er RPIMa) and &quot;2e régiment de chasseurs parachutistes&quot; (2e RCP) respectively.

===Composition (1940–1945)===

From 1940 to 1945, General Charles de Gaulle led the following departments:
*Free French Forces (&quot;Forces Françaises Libres, FFL&quot;) 
**1st Free French Division (&quot;1re Division Française Libre, 1re DFL&quot;)
**Free French Air Force (&quot;Forces Aériennes Françaises Libres, FAFL&quot;)
**Free French Naval Forces (&quot;Forces Navales Françaises Libres, FNFL&quot;)
**Free French Naval Air Service (&quot;Aéronavale française libre, AFL&quot;)
**Naval Commandos (&quot;Commandos Marine&quot;)
*the French Resistance branch called French Forces of the Interior (&quot;Forces Françaises de l&#x27;Intérieur, FFI&quot;)
*the intelligence service Central Bureau of Intelligence and Operations (&quot;Bureau Central de Renseignements et d&#x27;Action, BCRA&quot;)

===French Expeditionary Corps (1943–1944)===

Leclerc&#x27;s Free French Forces met Giraud&#x27;s Army of Africa for the first time near Tripoli, Libya, in 1943.

====Free French Forces and Army of Africa (August 1, 1943)====
When the Americans landed in Algiers in 1942 as part of Operation Torch, colonial soldiers of the Vichy-controlled Army of Africa surrendered without firing a shot. Charles de Gaulle drew from them to create the Corps Expéditionnaire Français (CEF) under General Alphonse Juin. The CEF was two-thirds Moroccan, Algerian, and Senegalese, and one-third Pied-Noir, totalling 112,000 men in four divisions. This unit took part in the 1943 Italian Campaign and in Operation Dragoon, the August 1944 Allied invasion of southern France.

Most African soldiers of the CEF grew up in the Atlas Mountains and were skilled and equipped for mountain warfare. Some units of exclusively Moroccan Goumiers (from Arabic: ) from the Rif mountains were grouped in units called &quot;tabors&quot; with tribal or direct family ties. There were 7,833 Goumiers.

The CEF was equipped with Allied weapons such as the .45 (11.43 mm) Thompson submachine gun and .50 (12.7 mm) Browning machine gun. The Moroccan fighters also carried a traditional curved dagger called a koumia.

By September 1944, the Free French forces had 560,000 soldiers. They grew to one million by the end of the year. They fought in Alsace, the Alps, and Brittany. When the war in Europe ended in May 1945, the Free French forces numbered 1.25 million, including seven infantry divisions and three armoured divisions fighting in Germany.

Other Free French units were directly attached to Allied forces, including the British SAS and RAF, and the Soviet Air Forces.

===Far East French Expeditionary Forces (1943–1945)===

The &quot;Forces Expéditionnaires Françaises d&#x27;Extrême-Orient&quot; (FEFEO) was a French expeditionary corps created on 4 October 1943 to fight in the Asian theatre of World War II and liberate French Indochina, which Japan had occupied since 1940. Recruiting posters for the FEFEO depicted a US-built M4 Sherman tank of general Leclerc&#x27;s Free French 2nd Armoured Division, famous for its role in the 1944 liberation of Paris and Strasbourg. The posters were captioned, &quot;yesterday Strasbourg, tomorrow Saigon: Join the Far East French Expeditionary Forces&quot;.

In 1945, after Japan surrendered and China was in charge in Indochina, the Provisional French Republic sent the French Far East Expeditionary Corps to Indochina to pacify the Vietnamese liberation movement and to restore French colonial rule.

====Gaurs and CLI commandos (1943–1945)====

Free French commando groups called &quot;Corps Léger d&#x27;Intervention&quot; (CLI) were created by de Gaulle in November 1943 as part of the FEFEO. They trained in French Algeria, then in British India after the British Chindits, to fight the Japanese forces in occupied French Indochina. They served in French Indochina under General Roger Blaizot beginning in 1944, and were airdropped by the British Force 136&#x27;s B-24 Liberator. The first CLI commandos were known as &quot;Gaurs&quot;, named after the Indian bison.

===Allied munitions (1942–1945)===
====British support====
Free French aircrews formed squadrons under the operational control of the Royal Air Force with British and Lend-Lease equipment. Britain lent warships to the Free French Naval Forces. In addition to providing materiel, the British trained some Free French pilots and airborne commandos such as the 3rd SAS (French) and 4th SAS (French) and the CLI.

====US support====
In 1941, while still neutral, the United States began providing Lend-Lease munitions to Britain and China. Some went to the Free French in North Africa, starting in 1942. Among the large inventories of American equipment given to Free French Forces were several versions of the M4 Sherman medium tank. French armored divisions were organized and equipped the same way as US Army armored divisions and were sizable offensive commands. In 1943, the French decided to raise a new army in North Africa and had an agreement with the Americans to equip it with modern American weapons. The French 2nd Armored Division () entered the Battle of Normandy fully equipped with M4A2 medium tanks.

The 1st and 5th DB, which entered southern France as part of the First French Army were equipped with a mixture of M4A2 and M4A4 medium tanks. The 3rd DB, which served as a training and reserve organization for the three operational armored divisions, was equipped with roughly 200 medium and light tanks. (Of these, 120 were later returned to the US Army&#x27;s Delta Base Section for reissue.) Subsequent combat losses for the 1st, 2nd, and 5th Armored Divisions were replaced with standard-issue tanks from US Army stocks.

The US Army also supplied the Free French Forces and Army of Africa with hundreds of US-built aircraft and materiel such as vehicles, artillery, helmets, uniforms, and firearms, as well as fuel and rations for many thousands of troops.

==Vichy France (1940–1944)==

===Armistice Army (1940–1944)===
The Armistice Army (&quot;Armée de l&#x27;Armistice&quot;), the official name of the army of the Vichy régime, had bases throughout the worldwide French colonial empire. It was created in July 1940 after Germany occupied the northern part of the metropolitan French territory under the armistice in June 1940. Apart from the Armistice Army, the French State created irregular forces to fight the French Resistance and internal and external communists, whom both Vichy and German authorities considered enemies.

===French State Navy (1940–1944)===

The Vichy French Navy (&quot;Marine de Vichy&quot;).

===French State Air Force (1940–1944)===

The Vichy French Air Force (&quot;Armée de l&#x27;air de Vichy&quot;).

===Legion of French Volunteers===

====French Legion of Fighters====
The French Legion of Fighters (&quot;&quot;) was the French State&#x27;s first paramilitary force, created on 29 August 1940 by Xavier Vallat.

On 19 November 1941, the force changed its name to French Legion of Fighters and Volunteers of the National Revolution (). The National Revolution was the French State&#x27;s official ideology.

====Legion of French Volunteers against Bolshevism====
The Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism (, or LVF) was a unit of the Wehrmacht army recruited from French collaborationist movements for the German invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. Officially designated the 638th Infantry Regiment (), it was one of a number of units formed at the same time in other parts of German-occupied Western Europe.

The Legion began as part of a coalition of far-right political factions including Marcel Déat&#x27;s National Popular Rally, Jacques Doriot&#x27;s French Popular Party, Eugène Deloncle&#x27;s Social Revolutionary Movement, and Pierre Costantini&#x27;s French League, which explicitly supported Nazi ideology and collaborated with Nazi Germany. By contrast, the conservative and authoritarian Vichy regime considered itself neutral and was more ambivalent about its dependence on Germany. However, the Vichy regime tolerated the LVF and gave it some endorsement.

====Tricolore Legion (1941–1942)====

The Tricolore Legion () was created by Pierre Laval and Jacques Benoist-Méchin in July 1941 and was disbanded in December 1942.

===French Milice (1943–44)===


Originating as the shock unit of the French Legion of Volunteers (), &quot;Franc-Garde&quot; (&quot;free guard&quot;), &quot;la Garde (&quot;the guard&quot;), &quot;la Milice&quot; (&quot;the militia&quot;) was a Vichy French paramilitary force created on 30 January 1943 by the Vichy régime as an auxiliary of the German occupation. It aimed to hunt down members of the French Resistance and the maquis. Its commander was Joseph Darnand, a veteran of the Battle of France and volunteer brigade; he took an oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler in October 1943 and received the rank of &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; (major) in the Waffen SS. By 1944, the Milice had over 35,000 members.

===Vichy French Paramilitary Forces (1940–1944)===
Just like Vichy police agents, the national police forces collaborated with the German authorities. French Youth Workings alumni had to swear allegiance to Marshal Pétain. The gesture was the Nazi salute while saying (&quot;I swear it!&quot;) instead of cheering Hitler.

====French Youth Workings (1940–1944)====
The Works of the French Youth () were a paramilitary youth organization created on 30 July 1940 by former Scout Movement Chief General of the 42nd Infantry Division as a substitute for a French army draft. Its members acted under Vichy army officers and dressed in military uniforms similar to those of the French Milice (béret included) and had to claim allegiance to Marshal Pétain with an arm salute.

The French Youth Workings were available in all French departments, which means they were also in French Algeria and apply to European settlers and Muslim locals. However, advised to reject young Jews, and so they were barred from the French Youth Workings by the decree of 15 July 1942, twenty-four hours before the Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv Roundup.

In November 1942, La Porte du Theil and van Hecke were both in French Algeria when the Allies invaded Algiers and Oran. , loyal to Pétain, flew to metropolitan France, while the second sided with the Free French and joined the Army of Africa. Local French Youth Workings became units of this military force, the most famous being the 7th Africa Light Infantry Regiment (&quot;, 7e RCA&quot;), created in 1943, which fought the Italians, French, and Germans in Allied campaigns from 1944 to 1945. The famous battle song &quot;Le Chant des Africains&quot; is dedicated to van Hecke and his 7e RCA.

====Reserve Mobile Group (1941–1944)====
The Reserve Mobile Group (&quot;, GMR&quot;) was a paramilitary force of Vichy France under René Bousquet. It was a police version of the Mobile Gendarmerie that served as French Milice and German Army auxiliary during battles against the French Resistance&#x27;s &quot;maquisards&quot;. In December 1944, the GMR were disbanded. Some members joined the French Forces of the Interior. The unit was replaced with the CRS riot police.

====French Gestapo (1941–1944)====
&quot;Carlingue&quot; was the name of the French Gestapo. It was headed by Henri Lafont, Pierre Loutrel, and Pierre Bonny. A famous Vichy French agent of the Gestapo was &quot;Scharführer-SS&quot; Pierre Paoli, who served in central France&#x27;s Cher department. Michael Mould wrote, &quot;It was staffed by the dregs of the French underworld.&quot;

===French SS (1942–1945)===

====8th Sturmbrigade SS Frankreich (1943–44)====
The &quot;8th Sturmbrigade SS Frankreich&quot; (&#x27;8th French assault brigade&#x27;) was created in 1943. Its surviving troops were incorporated into the 286th Security Division in 1944.

====33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1943–1945)====

The French State&#x27;s L.V.F. and the Milice merged to become a full division of the German army. The division&#x27;s name is a reference to the Frankish emperor Charlemagne, seen as an important Germanic figure in French history.

===The African Phalange (1942–43)===
The was created in French Tunisia in November 1942 to fight against the Allies, Free French Forces, and Army of Africa following Operation Torch. This unit, led by Lieutenant-colonel , Lieutenant-colonel Simon Petru Cristofini, and Captain André Dupuis, was also called the Legion of French Volunteers () or Frankonia Company ().

===North-African Legion (1944)===
The &quot;&quot; (LNA), or (BNA), was a paramilitary force of Parisians of Arab and Kabyle descent, created by French Gestapo agent Henri Lafont and Muslim Algerian nationalist Mohamed el-Maadi.

== French Resistance (1940–1945) ==

===Resistance groups (1940–1945)===
The first French Resistance groups were created in June 1940 following Marshal Pétain&#x27;s call to stop fighting on 17 June. More groups formed after the signing of the French–German–Italian armistices in July 1940. There were myriad paramilitary groups of various sizes and political ideologies which made it difficult to later unify them under a single chain of command. Famous groups included communist &quot;, FTP&quot; (&#x27;Partisan irregular riflemen&#x27;) and rebel police force (&#x27;Honour of the Police&#x27;).

The French Resistance gradually grew in strength. Charles de Gaulle set a plan to bring together the different groups under his leadership. He changed the name of his movement to (&#x27;Fighting French Forces&#x27;) and sent Jean Moulin back to France to unite the eight major French Resistance groups into one organisation. Moulin got their agreement to form the (&#x27;National Council of the Resistance&#x27;). He was eventually captured and killed under torture.

==French colonial empire (1940–1945)==
===Struggle for the colonies===


During World War II, the French colonies were administered by the Minister of the Navy and Colonies. On 16 June 1940, Minister César Campinchi resigned and Admiral François Darlan took over authority for the colonies.

On 21 June, Campinchi and other government members such as Minister of the Interior Georges Mandel left metropolitan France on the ocean liner SS &quot;Massilia&quot; from Bordeaux. They arrived on 24 June in Casablanca, French Morocco. Mandel wanted to establish a government-in-exile in French North Africa and continue to fight Nazis with the power of the colonies. However, they were arrested on arrival by the administrator of French Morocco, General Charles Noguès, on orders from General Maxime Weygand and Marshal Philippe Pétain. Pétain had signed a French–German–Italian armistice on 22 June, becoming the chief &quot;de facto&quot; of state, so the French colonial empire had become a Nazi possession.

Inspired by Mandel, General Charles de Gaulle succeeded in creating a French government-in-exile in London. He tried to rally the colonies to his cause, hoping to gain troops and strategic bases to liberate metropolitan France. In 1940, a few colonies joined the Free French, but others remained under Vichy control. De Gaulle&#x27;s reputation was then as a military man with no political experience or following. His charisma was not sufficient to gather the allegiance of senior colonial administrators or generals. As a result, Free French colonies fought Vichy French colonies, each one siding with the Axis or the Allies.

===Army of Africa (1942–1943)===

Created in 1830, the Army of Africa was a colonial expeditionary force that conquered the Regency of Algiers in 1847. It fought in 1939 and 1940 as a force of the French Third Republic. After France surrendered, it became a Vichy force that fought the Allies from 1940 to 1942 at the battle of Mers-el-Kébir and in Operation Torch. It evolved into a rebel faction of the Vichy forces in 1942 and eventually merged with the Free French Forces prior to 1944 operations in mainland Europe.

Formed of European settlers and indigenous colonial units of French North Africa, French West Africa, and French Equatorial Africa, the Army of Africa received ample supplies from the United States through a lend-lease plan. This new force, well-equipped with US materiel, was nicknamed the (&#x27;New French Army&#x27;). On 26 December 1942, Giraud became head of the French Civil and Military High Command of French North Africa forces after the assassination of Vichy admiral François Darlan.

===Operation Torch aftermath===
During Operation Torch—the Allied invasion of Vichy-controlled French North Africa in November 1942—many Vichy troops surrendered and joined the Free French. The French Resistance captured Vichy coastal defences. Giraud became head of the Army of Africa, joining the Allies as the French XIX Corps, based in French Algeria.

===Axis retaliations (1942–1943)===

The Nazis suspected Vichy involvement after Operation Torch. They occupied the southern French &quot;zone libre&quot; in November 1942, during &quot;Case Anton&quot;. The Luftwaffe units based in Libya also several times bombed the harbour of Algiers and cities in eastern French Algeria, including Annaba and Jijel.

===Free French colonies===
In the summer of 1940, the French colonies of the New Hebrides, Cameroon, French India, French Equatorial Africa, French Polynesia and New Caledonia joined the Free French. Saint-Pierre and Miquelon joined later in 1941.

===Vichy French colonies===
French Indochina was under Vichy control and Japanese oversight from 1940 until 1944, and then under total Japanese rule. Guadeloupe and Martinique in the West Indies remained under Vichy government control until 1942.

===Allied angary (1940)===

====Operation Catapult and Lend-Lease====

Starting with Operation Catapult on 3 July 1940, the British pre-emptively seized French vessels. Both combatants and merchant ships docked in British harbours of the English Channel (Plymouth), Mediterranean (Gibraltar), and Canada were abruptly taken over by armed sailors and soldiers. Their crews were interned and the vessels were appropriated and distributed to the British or Polish fleets. Later, if they were willing to recognize Charles de Gaulle as the legitimate leader of the French government-in-exile, the interned personnel were set free and assigned to new ships by the British. American aid under Lend-Lease made possible a rebuilt and expanded French Navy as one of the Western Allies.

====British capture====
French ships in British ports were boarded by armed sailors. These included the &quot;Surcouf&quot;, a submarine in Plymouth for repairs in July 1940. &quot;Surcouf&quot;&#x27;s repairs were completed and it was turned over to the Free French by August. In 1941, she acted as an escort for trans-Atlantic convoys. In November 1940, she caused four deaths (three British, one French) and the capture of the merchant ship MV &quot;Charles Plumier&quot; in Gibraltar. This later became , a command ship in several amphibious landings.

===Axis requisition (1940–1945)===

In Operation Lila, the Germans attempted to seize the remains of the French navy. In Toulon, the French ships were scuttled rather than surrendered. Seventy-seven vessels, including three battleships, seven cruisers, and fifteen destroyers were deliberately sunk. Some submarines ignored their orders to scuttle themselves and escaped to fight with the Allies.

==Theatres of World War II==

===European===
====Phoney War (1939)====

France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 under the Franco-Polish Military Alliance following the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939. A French force invaded the Saarland in western Germany in the Saar Offensive led by general Louis Faury, who prior to the war had been head of the French Military Mission to Poland.

Although tactically successful, as the advance into German territory reached 8 km, the Saar operation was abandoned on 12 September when the Anglo French Supreme War Council decided to halt all offensive actions immediately. This SWC was composed of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Lord Chatfield as the British delegation while Prime Minister Édouard Daladier and General Maurice Gamelin formed the French delegation. General Gamelin ordered French troops to withdraw to the Maginot Line in France, leaving Poland to face the Germans and Soviets alone; the latter entered Poland on 17 September. On 16 October, German general Erwin von Witzleben started a counter-offensive against France, entering a few kilometers into its territory, and the last French forces left Germany the following day to defend their country.

==== Battle of Belgium (10–28 May 1940) ====
Under the &quot;Dyle plan&quot;, the 1st, 7th, and 9th armies with the British Expeditionary Force between the 7th and 9th Armies moved into Belgium and the Netherlands to counter a German attack similar to the Schlieffen Plan in World War I.

The unsuccessful defence of Belgium and the surrender of King Leopold III of Belgium on 28 May spurred the creation of the Free Belgian Forces.

====Battle of the Netherlands (10–14 May 1940)====

The French 7th Army under General Henri Giraud fought the Germans in support of French ally the Netherlands.

====Battle of France (10 May – 25 June 1940)====
=====Prelude=====

Neither the French nor the British had foreseen the rapid defeat of Poland. The speed of the Nazi victory, relying on blitzkrieg, disturbed some generals in London and Paris. But the Allies still expected to contain the Germans in a war reasonably like the First World War, and that even without an Eastern Front the Germans could be defeated by blockade, as in the previous conflict. Paris had suffered more severely in the First World War and had doubts; Prime Minister of France Édouard Daladier noted the large gap between France&#x27;s resources and those of Germany.

French commander Maurice Gamelin also expected a repeat of World War I&#x27;s Schlieffen Plan. Much of the French army in the 1930s had been designed for offensive warfare, but the French military staff believed the country was not militarily or economically equipped for a decisive offensive, and that it would be better to wait until 1941, when the combined Allied economic superiority over Germany could be fully exploited. The expected German plan – a move into the Low Countries, outflanking the fortified Maginot Line – could be countered by sending the best units of the French army and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to halt the Germans near the river Dyle, east of Brussels, until a decisive victory could be achieved with the support of the united British, Belgian, French, and Dutch armies. The original German plan in fact closely followed Gamelin&#x27;s expectations.

The crash in Belgium of a light plane carrying two German officers with a copy of the then-current invasion plan forced Hitler to scrap the plan and search for an alternative. The final plan of (Case Yellow) had been suggested by General Erich von Manstein, then serving as Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt, but initially rejected by the German General Staff. It proposed a deep penetration south of the original route, taking advantage of the speed of the Panzer divisions to separate and encircle the opposing forces. It had the advantage of surprising the defenders, as the Ardennes were heavily wooded and implausible as a route for tanks. The plan also was unknown to the Allies, and was dramatic, which seems to have appealed to Hitler.

Manstein planned to break through the weak Allied centre with overwhelming force, trap his opponents to the north in a pocket, and drive on to Paris. The plan would benefit from an Allied response close to what they expected; a large part of French and British strength would be drawn north to defend Belgium and Picardy. To help ensure this result, German Army Group B would still attack Belgium and the Netherlands in order to draw Allied forces east into the developing encirclement and secure bases for a later attack on Britain.

After capturing the original invasion plans, the Allies were initially jubilant, thinking that they might have won a key victory before the campaign was even fought. But General Gamelin and Lord Gort, the commander of the BEF, were shaken when they realized the Germans would instead not do what they had planned for. Gamelin became convinced that the Germans would try to attempt a breakthrough, concentrating their mechanized forces. They could hardly hope to break the Maginot Line on the right or to overcome the Allied forces on the left. That left only the centre and the river Meuse. Tanks were useless in defeating fortified river positions. However, at Namur, the river made a sharp turn to the east, creating a gap between itself and the river Dyle. This Gembloux Gap, ideal for mechanized warfare, was a very dangerous weak spot. Gamelin decided to concentrate half of his armoured reserves there. The Germans could try to take the Meuse position with infantry, but that could only be achieved by massive artillery support, the build-up of which would give Gamelin ample warning.

=====Campaign in the Low Countries and northern France=====
Germany launched on the night of 9/10 May. German forces occupied Luxembourg and in the morning German Army Group B (Bock) launched a feint into the Netherlands and Belgium. German Fallschirmjäger from the 7th Flieger and 22nd Air Landing divisions under Kurt Student executed surprise landings at The Hague, on the road to Rotterdam, and against the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael to facilitate Army Group B&#x27;s advance.

The Allied command reacted immediately, sending forces north to combat a plan that, for all the Allies could expect, resembled the earlier Schlieffen plan. This move north committed their best forces, diminished their fighting power through loss of readiness, and reduced their mobility through loss of fuel. That evening, French troops crossed the Dutch border. The Luftwaffe quickly obtained air superiority, depriving the Allies of key reconnaissance abilities and disrupting Allied communication and coordination.

The German invaders secured all the strategically vital bridges in and toward Rotterdam, penetrating &quot;Fortress Holland&quot; and bypassing the Water Line, but their attempt to seize The Hague ended in complete failure, which later led the Germans to skip paratrooper attacks. The airfields surrounding the city (Ypenburg, Ockenburg, and Valkenburg) were taken with heavy casualties on 10 May, only to be lost on the very same day to furious counterattacks launched by the two Dutch reserve infantry divisions.

The French marched north to connect with the Dutch army, which came under attack from German paratroopers, but by simply not understanding German intentions they failed to block German armoured reinforcements from the 9th Panzer Division from reaching Rotterdam on 13 May. The Dutch, their poorly equipped army largely intact, surrendered on 14 May after the Germans bombed Rotterdam. However, the Dutch troops in Zeeland and the colonies continued the fight while Queen Wilhelmina established a government-in-exile in Britain.

The centre of the Belgian defensive line, Fort Eben-Emael, had been seized by German paratroopers using gliders on 10 May, allowing their forces to cross the bridges over the Albert Canal, although the arrival of the British Expeditionary Force managed to save the Belgians for a time. Gamelin&#x27;s plan in the north was achieved when the British army reached the Dyle; then the expected major tank battle took place in the Gembloux Gap between the French 2nd and 3rd Divisions &quot;Légères mécaniques&quot;, (Mechanized Light Divisions), and the German 3rd and 4th Panzer divisions of Erich Hoepner&#x27;s XVI Motorized Corps, costing both sides about 100 vehicles. The German offensive in Belgium seemed stalled for a moment; but this was a feint.

=====German breakthrough=====

In the centre, German Army Group A smashed through Belgian infantry regiments and French Light Divisions of the Cavalry (&quot;&quot;) while advancing into the Ardennes, and arrived at the river Meuse near Sedan the night of 12/13 May. On 13 May, the Germans forced three crossings near Sedan. Instead of slowly massing artillery as the French expected, the Germans replaced the need for traditional artillery by using the full might of their bomber force to punch a hole in a narrow sector of the French lines with carpet bombing (punctuated by dive bombing). During the Battle of Sedan, the city was held by the 55th French Infantry Division (55e DI), a grade &quot;B&quot; reserve division. The forward elements of the 55e DI held their positions through most of the 13th, initially repulsing three of the six German crossing attempts; however, German air attacks had disrupted the French supporting artillery batteries and created an impression among the troops of the 55e DI that they were isolated and abandoned. The combination of the psychological impact of the bombing, the slowly expanding German lodgements, deep penetrations by some small German infantry units, and the lack of air or artillery support eventually broke down the 55e DI&#x27;s resistance and much of the unit went into rout by the evening of 13/14 May. The German aerial attack of 13 May, with 1215 bomber sorties, the heaviest air bombardment the world had yet witnessed, is considered to have been very effective and key to the successful German river crossing. It was the most effective use of tactical air power yet demonstrated in warfare.

The disorder begun at Sedan was spread down the French line by groups of haggard retreating soldiers. During the night, some units in the last prepared defence line at Bulson panicked over a false rumour that German tanks were already behind their positions. On 14 May, two French tank battalions and supporting infantry from the 71st Infantry Division (71e DI) counter-attacked the German bridgehead without success. The attack was partially repulsed by the first German armour and anti-tank units which had been rushed across the river as quickly as possible at 7:20 A.M. on pontoon bridges. On 14 May, every available Allied light bomber was employed in an attempt to destroy the German pontoon bridges; but, despite incurring the highest single day action losses in the entire history of the British and French air forces, failed to destroy these targets. Despite the failure of numerous quickly planned counterattacks to collapse the German bridgehead, the French Army was successful in re-establishing a continuous defensive position further south; on the west flank of the bridgehead, however, French resistance began to crumble.

The commander of the French Second Army, General Huntziger, immediately took effective measures to prevent a further weakening of his position. An armoured division (3rd &quot;Division Cuirassée&quot;) and a motorized division blocked further German advances around his flank. However, the commander of XIX Panzer Corps, Heinz Guderian, was not interested in Huntziger&#x27;s flank. Leaving for the moment the 10th Panzer Division at the bridgehead to protect it from attacks by 3rd DCR, he moved his 1st and 2nd Panzer divisions sharply to the west on the 15th, undercutting the flank of the French Ninth Army by 40 km and forcing the 102nd Fortress Division to leave the positions that had blocked the XVI Panzer Corps at Monthermé. The French Second Army had been seriously mauled and rendered impotent, and the Ninth Army began to disintegrate completely, for in Belgium also its divisions, not having had the time to fortify, had been pushed back from the river by the unrelenting pressure of German infantry, allowing the impetuous Erwin Rommel to break free with his 7th Panzer Division. A French armoured division, the 1st DCR, was sent to block him, but advancing unexpectedly fast, he surprised it while refuelling on the 15th and dispersed it, despite some losses caused by the heavy French tanks.

On the 16th, both Guderian and Rommel disobeyed their explicit direct orders to halt in an act of open insubordination against their superiors and moved their divisions many kilometres to the west, as fast as they could push them. Guderian reached Marle, 80 kilometres from Sedan; Rommel crossed the river Sambre at Le Cateau, a hundred kilometres from his bridgehead, Dinant. While nobody knew the whereabouts of Rommel (he had advanced so quickly that he was out of range of radio contact, earning his 7th Panzer Division the nickname (&#x27;Ghost Division&#x27;), an enraged von Kleist flew to Guderian on the morning of the 17th and after a heated argument relieved him of all duties. However, von Rundstedt blatantly refused to confirm the order.

=====Allied reaction=====
The Panzer Corps slowed their advance considerably but were stretched out, exhausted, and low on fuel; many tanks had broken down. There was now a dangerous gap between them and the infantry. A determined attack by a large, fresh mechanized force could have cut them off and wiped them out. The French high command, however, was reeling from the sudden offensive and stung by defeatism. On the morning of 15 May, French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud telephoned the new British prime minister, Winston Churchill, saying &quot;We have been defeated. We are beaten; we have lost the battle.&quot; Churchill reminded him of the times the Germans had broken through Allied lines in World War I, only to be stopped. However, Reynaud was inconsolable. Churchill flew to Paris on 16 May and recognized the gravity of the situation; the French government was already burning its archives and preparing for an evacuation of the capital. In a sombre meeting with the French commanders, Churchill asked General Gamelin, &quot;Where is the strategic reserve?&quot; which had saved Paris in the First World War. &quot;There is none&quot;, Gamelin replied. Later, Churchill described hearing this as the single most shocking moment in his life. Churchill asked Gamelin when and where the general proposed to launch a counterattack against the flanks of the German bulge. Gamelin simply replied &quot;inferiority of numbers, inferiority of equipment, inferiority of methods&quot;.

Gamelin was right; most reserve divisions had by now been committed. The only armoured division still in reserve, 2nd DCR, attacked on the 16th. However, the French armoured infantry divisions, the , were (despite their name) specialized breakthrough units, optimized for attacking fortified positions. They could be quite useful for defence if dug in, but had limited utility for an encounter fight: they could not execute combined infantry-tank tactics as they simply had no large motorized infantry component; they had poor tactical mobility as the heavy Char B1 bis, their main tank in which half of the French tank budget had been invested, had to refuel twice a day. So, 2nd DCR divided itself in a covering screen. Small subunits fought bravely but without strategic effect.

Of course, some of the best units in the north had so far seen little fighting. Had they been kept in reserve, they could have been used for a decisive counter strike. But now they had lost much fighting power simply by moving to the north; hurrying south again would cost them even more. The most powerful allied division, the 1st DLM (), deployed near Dunkirk on the 10th, had moved its forward units 220 km to the northeast, beyond the Dutch city of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, in 32 hours. Finding that the Dutch had already retreated to the north, it had withdrawn and was now moving to the south. When it reached the Germans again, only 3 of its original 80 SOMUA S35 tanks were operational, mostly due to breakdowns.

Nevertheless, a radical decision to retreat to the south, avoiding contact, could probably have saved most of the mechanized and motorized divisions, including the BEF. However, that would have meant leaving about thirty infantry divisions to their fate. The loss of Belgium alone would be an enormous political blow. Besides, the Allies were uncertain of German intentions. They threatened in four directions: to the north, to attack the allied main force directly; to the west, to cut it off; to the south, to occupy Paris and even to the east, to move behind the Maginot Line. The French decided to create a new reserve, among which a reconstituted 7th Army, under General , using every unit they could safely pull out of the Maginot Line to block the way to Paris.

De Gaulle, in command of France&#x27;s hastily formed 4th Armoured Division, attempted to launch an attack from the south and achieved a measure of success that would later accord him considerable fame and a promotion to brigadier general. However, de Gaulle&#x27;s attacks on the 17th and 19th did not significantly alter the overall situation.

=====Channel attacks, battle of Dunkirk, and the Weygand Plan (17–28 May)=====

While the Allies did little either to threaten them or escape from the danger they posed, the Panzer corps used 17 and 18 May to refuel, eat, sleep, and repair some more tanks. On 18 May, Rommel made the French give up Cambrai by merely feinting an armoured attack.

On 19 May, the German High Command grew very confident. The Allies seemed incapable of coping with events. There appeared to be no serious threat from the south – indeed General Franz Halder, Chief of Army General Staff, toyed with the idea of attacking Paris immediately to knock France out of the war in one blow. The Allied troops in the north were retreating to the river Scheldt, their right flank giving way to the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions. It would be foolish to remain inactive any longer, allowing them to reorganize their defence or escape. Now it was time to bring them into even more serious trouble by cutting them off. The next day the Panzer Corps started moving again, smashed through the weak British 12th and 23rd Territorial divisions, occupied Amiens, and secured the westernmost bridge over the river Somme at Abbeville, isolating the British, French, Dutch and Belgian forces in the north. In the evening of 20 May, a reconnaissance unit from 2nd Panzer Division reached Noyelles, to the west, where they could see the estuary of the Somme flowing into The Channel.

On 20 May, French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud dismissed Maurice Gamelin for failing to contain the German offensive and replaced him with Maxime Weygand, who immediately attempted to devise new tactics to contain the Germans. More pressing, however, was his strategic task: he formed the Weygand Plan to pinch off the German armoured spearhead by combined attacks from the north and the south. On the map, this seemed feasible: the corridor through which von Kleist&#x27;s two Panzer Corps had moved to the coast was a mere wide. On paper, Weygand had sufficient forces to execute it: in the north, the three DLM and the BEF; in the south, de Gaulle&#x27;s 4th DCR. These units had an organic strength of about 1,200 tanks. The Panzer divisions were very vulnerable again. The mechanical condition of their tanks was rapidly deteriorating but the condition of the Allied divisions was far worse. Both in the south and the north they could in reality muster only a handful of tanks. Nevertheless, Weygand flew to Ypres on the 21st, trying to convince the Belgians and the BEF of the soundness of his plan.

Also 21 May, a detachment of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) under Major-General Harold Franklyn had already attempted to at least delay the German offensive and, perhaps, to cut off the leading edge of the German army. The resulting Battle of Arras demonstrated the value of the heavily armoured British Matilda tanks, as the German 37 mm anti-tank guns proved ineffective against them, and the limited raid overran two German regiments. The panic that resulted—the German commander at Arras, Erwin Rommel, reported being attacked by &#x27;hundreds&#x27; of tanks, though there were only 58 at the battle—temporarily delayed the German offensive. German reinforcements pressed the British back to Vimy Ridge the following day.

Although this attack was not part of any coordinated attempt to destroy the Panzer Corps, the German High Command panicked a lot more than Rommel. For a moment they feared they had been ambushed, and a thousand Allied tanks were about to smash their elite forces. But the next day they had regained confidence and ordered Heinz Guderian&#x27;s XIX Panzer Corps to press north and push on to the Channel ports of Boulogne and Calais, behind the British and Allied forces to the north.

That same day, the 22nd, the French tried to attack southwards east of Arras with some infantry and tanks, but the German infantry had begun to catch up and the attack was, with some difficulty, stopped by the 32nd Infantry Division.

On the 24th, the first attack from the south was launched when the 7th DIC, supported by a handful of tanks, failed to retake Amiens. On 27 May, part of the British 1st Armoured Division, hastily brought over from England, attacked Abbeville in force but was beaten back with crippling losses. The next day de Gaulle tried again, with the same result. But by now even a complete success could not have saved the forces in the north.

In the early hours of 23 May, Gort ordered a retreat from Arras. He had no faith in the Weygand plan nor in the proposal of the latter to at least try to hold a pocket on the Flemish coast, a &quot;Réduit de Flandres&quot;. The ports needed to supply such a foothold were already threatened. That day, the 2nd Panzer Division assaulted Boulogne and 10th Panzer assaulted Calais. The British garrison in Boulogne surrendered on 25 May, although 4,368 troops were evacuated. Calais, though strengthened by the arrival of the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment equipped with cruiser tanks and the 30th Motor Brigade, fell to the Germans on 27 May.

While the 1st Panzer Division was ready to attack Dunkirk on the 25th, Hitler ordered it to halt on 24 May. This remains one of the most controversial decisions of the entire war. Hermann Göring had convinced Hitler the Luftwaffe could prevent an evacuation; Rundstedt had warned him that any further effort by the armoured divisions would lead to a very long refitting period. Attacking cities was not part of the normal task for armoured units under any operational doctrine. Also, the terrain around Dunkirk was thought unsuitable for armour.

===== Allied evacuations (26 May – 25 June) =====

Encircled, the British, Belgians, and French launched Operation Dynamo (26 May – 4 June) and later Operation Aerial (14–25 June), evacuating Allied forces from the northern pocket in Belgium and Pas-de-Calais, beginning on 26 May. The Allied position was complicated by King Leopold III of Belgium&#x27;s surrender the following day, which was postponed until 28 May.

Confusion still reigned however, as after the evacuation at Dunkirk and while Paris was enduring its short-lived siege, the First Canadian Division and a Scottish division were sent to Normandy and penetrated 200 miles inland toward Paris before they heard that Paris had fallen and France had capitulated. They retreated and re-embarked for England. At the same time as the Canadian 1st division landed in Brest, the Canadian 242 Squadron of the RAF flew their Hawker Hurricanes to Nantes, 100 miles south-east, and set up there to provide air cover.

===== British retreat, French defeat (5–10 June 1940) =====

The best and most modern French armies had been sent north and lost in the resulting encirclement; the French had lost their best heavy weaponry and armoured formations. Maxime Weygand was faced with a hemorrhage in the front stretching from Sedan to the English Channel, and the French government had begun to doubt that the Germans could still be defeated, particularly as the remaining British forces were retreating from the battlefield and returning to Great Britain, a particularly symbolic event for French morale, intensified by the German anti-British propaganda slogan &quot;The British will fight to the last Frenchman&quot;.

The Germans renewed their offensive on 5 June on the Somme. A panzer-led attack on Paris broke the scarce reserves that Weygand had put between the Germans and the capital, and on 10 June the French government fled to Bordeaux, declaring Paris an open city.

===== Italy&#x27;s declaration of war, French-Italian air battles, UK ends French support (10–11 June 1940) =====
On 10 June, Italy declared war on France and Britain; Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) started its bomb raids over France. On 13 June, French ace pilot Pierre Le Gloan shot down two Fiat BR.20 bombers with his Dewoitine D.520 fighter. On 15 June, Le Gloan, along with another pilot, attacked a group of twelve Italian Fiat CR.42 Falco fighters, and shot down three of them, while Cpt. Assolent shot down another. While returning to the airfield, Le Gloan shot down another CR.42 and another BR.20 bomber. For this achievement of destroying five aircraft in one flight, he was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant.

The following week, an Italian army crossed the Alps and fought with the French &quot;Chasseurs Alpins&quot; (Alpine Hunters), the Regia Aeronautica carried out 716 bombing missions in support of the invasion of France by the Italian Royal Army (). Italian aircraft dropped a total of 276 tons of bombs.

Churchill returned to France on 11 June, meeting the French War Council in Briare. The French, in a panic, wanted Churchill to give every available fighter to the air battle over France; with only 25 squadrons remaining, Churchill refused to further help his ally, believing that the decisive battle would be fought over Britain (the Battle of Britain started on 10 July). The British ended their support and left France to its fate, facing the Germans and Italians alone. Concerned about an upcoming German invasion of his own country, Churchill, at the meeting, obtained promises from French admiral François Darlan that the French Navy fleet would not fall into German hands.

===== French-German negotiations, Pétain&#x27;s appeal (16–17 June) =====

Paul Reynaud resigned because he believed a majority of his government favoured an armistice. He was succeeded by a patriarchal figure: 84-year-old World War I veteran &quot;Maréchal&quot; Philippe Pétain. On 16 June, the new French President of the council, Philippe Pétain (the President of the Republic office was vacant 11 July 1940 – 16 January 1947), began to negotiate with Axis officials. On 17 June 1940, Marshal Pétain delivered an infamous radio appeal to the French people urging them &quot;we must stop fighting&quot; ().

==== Italian invasion of France (20–22 June) ====
==== French–German and French–Italian armistices (22 June 1940) ====

On 21 June, Italian troops crossed the border in three places. Roughly thirty-two Italian divisions faced just four French divisions. Fighting continued in the east until General Prételat, commanding the French Second Army group, was forced by the armistice to surrender on June 22. France formally surrendered to the Germans on June 22 in the same railroad car at Compiègne in which Germany had been forced to surrender in 1918. This railway car was lost in Allied air raids on the German capital of Berlin later in the war.

=====Nazi occupation, Vichy France, and Armistice Army=====
Metropolitan France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north and west and an unoccupied &quot;zone libre&quot; in the south. Pétain set up a collaborationist government based in the spa town of Vichy. The authoritarian French State, replacing the abolished French Third Republic, came to be known as Vichy France.

=====Formation of Free France and the French Resistance=====

Charles de Gaulle, who had been made an Undersecretary of National Defense by Paul Reynaud, was in London at the time of the surrender: having made his Appeal of 18 June as an answer to Pétain&#x27;s appeal of 17 June, he refused to recognize the Vichy government as legitimate – the position of President of France was vacant – and began organizing the Free French Forces. A number of French colonies like French Equatorial Africa joined de Gaulle&#x27;s fight. Others, like French Indochina, were attacked by the Japanese or remained loyal to the Vichy government. Italy occupied a small area of France, essentially the Alpes-Maritimes and Corsica.

====Free French airmen in RAF (June 1940–1945)====
The first Free French pilots flew from Bordeaux to rally de Gaulle in England on 17 June 1940. These individuals served in British squadrons until there were sufficient pilots to create All-Free French RAF flights.

=====Free French pilots in the battle of Britain (10 July – 31 October 1940)=====
Thirteen Free French pilots (from France) fought in the Battle of Britain against the German Luftwaffe. Among these men were Adjutant Émile Fayolle, son of an admiral and grandson of French Marshal Marie Émile Fayolle. When the Armistice was signed on 22 June 1940, Fayolle was at the Fighter School at Oran, French Algeria. On 30 June, he and a comrade flew to the British base at Gibraltar and from there sailed to Liverpool where they arrived on 13 July and joined the RAF. Flying with other squadrons from September 1940, in November 1941 Fayolle joined No. 340 (Free French) Squadron RAF, the first all-French fighter unit. Another pilot with a similar course was Adjutant René Mouchotte. Eleven Free French pilots were posted to No.1 School of Army Co-operation, Old Sarum, on 29 July. Mouchotte was posted to Turnhouse, Scotland, as Deputy &#x27;A&#x27; Flight Commander with 340 Squadron on 10 November. On 18 January 1943, Captain Mouchotte returned to Turnhouse to form and command the 341 Free French Squadron.

=====All-Free French RAF Squadrons (1941–1945)=====
In the summer of 1941, the British commander of the Fighter Command accepted the creation of the No. 340 Free French (Fighter) Squadron (also known as ), a Free French unit attached to the No. 13 Group RAF, equipped with Spitfire aircraft and formed at Turnhouse. Other notable All-Free French RAF flights were the No. 327 Squadron RAF and No. 341 Squadron RAF.

=====Battle of Dieppe (19 August 1942)=====
====French on the Eastern front (1941–1945)====

=====Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism (1941–1943)=====
The French State sent an expeditionary force, called Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism () (LVF), to fight the Soviet Red Army alongside the German Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front. This volunteer unit, including old men and 15-year-old children as evidenced by Nazi propaganda archives, took part in Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, beginning November 1941.

The German designation for the LVF was &quot;Infanterie-Regiment 638&quot; (&quot;638th Infantry Regiment&quot;) and it served under Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, commander of the German 4th Army. It fought in the Battle of Diut&#x27;kovo (maybe Dyatkovo), part of the Battle of Moscow, and the Battle of Berezina, as hinted by its flag. It suffered extremely high casualties due to combat and frostbite.

=====Vichy French Sturmbataillon Charlemagne last defenders of Berlin (April–May 1945)=====

The Vichy French SS battalion Charlemagne (remains of the French SS Division Charlemagne) under &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; (Captain) Henri Fenet was among the last defenders of the Nazi German capital, fighting against Soviet forces during the Battle of Berlin in April–May 1945.

=====Free French Normandie-Niemen (1942–1945)=====

A fighter aviation group named Normandie-Niemen fought on the Eastern Front as part of the Soviet air force. These French volunteers were equipped with first-rate Yakovlev Soviet-built fighters.

At de Gaulle&#x27;s initiative, the Free French Air Force was formed on 1 September 1942, to serve on the Eastern Front. It flew as part of the Soviet 1st Air Army and served with distinction with Soviet aircraft and was awarded the supplementary title &quot;Niemen&quot; (from the Belarus river) by Joseph Stalin. Its first commander, , was killed in action.

Normandie-Niemen evolved from a single squadron called &quot;Normandie&quot; to a full regiment which included Squadron Caen, Squadron Le Havre and Squadron Rouen. Their battle honors were Oryol (1943), Smolensk (1943), Orche (1944), Berezina (1944), Niemen (1944), Chernyakhovsk (1945) and Baltiysk (1945). By the end of World War II, the Free French unit counted 273 certified victories, 37 non-certified victories, and 45 damaged aircraft with 869 fights and 42 dead.

On 31 May 1945, Normandie-Niemen squadrons were directed to Moscow by the Soviet authorities, who decided to allow them to return to France with their aircraft as a reward. The 40 French pilots still active with the regiment flew back to France in Yak-3 fighters. They arrived at Elbląg, Poland on 15 June 1945, and in Paris Le Bourget, through Posen, Prague, and Stuttgart, on 21 June. Their arrival at Stuttgart and parade at Le Bourget were filmed.

====Maquis du Limousin (June 1942 – August 1944)====
====Italian campaign (1943–1944)====

=====French Expeditionary Corps=====

During the Italian campaign of 1943, 130,000 Free French soldiers fought on the Allied side.

The 1st group, 1st Landing Corps (), later redesignated as the French Expeditionary Corps () (CEF), participated in the Italian Campaign with two divisions and two separate brigades from late 1943 to 23 July 1944.

=====Bernhardt Line (1 December 1943 – 15 January 1944)=====

In the Italian Campaign, the Bernhardt Line (or Reinhard Line) was a German defense over the massif of Monte Cassino, defended by the XIV Panzer Corps (&quot;XIV Panzerkorps&quot;) of the German Tenth Army (&quot;10. Armee&quot;). The US Fifth Army reached it in early December 1943 and fought until mid-January 1944 to reach the next defence, the Gustav Line.

=====Battle of Monte Cassino (17 January – 18 May 1944)=====

In 1944, this corps was reinforced by two additional divisions and played an essential role in the Battle of Monte Cassino. The Allied capture of Monte Cassino resulted in 55,000 Allied casualties, and around 20,000 Germans killed or wounded. After the Allies captured Rome, the Corps withdrew from Italy and incorporated into the B Army (&quot;Armée B&quot;) for the invasion of southern France.

=====Operation Diadem (May 1944)=====

The Allied Operation Diadem of the Italian Campaign in May 1944 successfully assaulted German Gustav Line defences in the Italian Liri valley, the primary route to Rome. Breaking through German lines, it eased pressure on the Anzio beachhead and tied German troops up in Italy to prevent their deployment against the Normandy landings. Diadem was supported by air attacks called Operation Strangle and by the British XIII Corps, and the French Corps (including Moroccan Goumiers). The opposing force was the German 10th Army. On 11 May 1944, elements of the British 4th Infantry Division and 8th Indian Infantry Division, with supporting fire from the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade, performed a successful night crossing of the Garigliano and Rapido rivers, against strong resistance. The French Corps pushed through the mountains on 14 May, supported by US II Corps of the Fifth Army. On 17 May, Polish II Corps on the right attacked Monte Cassino.

The Germans fell back some 10 miles to the Hitler Line, where the four Allied units attacked again on 23 May, as well as the US VI Corps out of Anzio. The 1st Canadian Infantry Division&#x27;s 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards breached the Hitler Line at Pontecorvo on 23 May. The Germans retreated northwest. The Germans fought a series of delaying actions and retreated to the Trasimene Line, then the Gothic Line north of the Arno river.

===== Operation Brassard (17–18 June 1944) =====
In June 1944, the invasion of Elba followed the success of Operation Diadem. The 9th Colonial Infantry Division (9 DIC) and &quot;Choc&quot; (special forces) battalions of I Corps assaulted and seized the heavily fortified island, defended by German fortress infantry and coastal artillery troops. Combat on the island was characterized by close-in fighting, flamethrowers, well-ranged German artillery, and liberal use of landmines.

====France maquis warfare (January–July 1944)====

=====Battle of Vercors (January–July)=====
A force of 4,000 French Resistance (FFI) fighters proclaimed the Free Republic of Vercors opposing the German army and French Milice.

=====Battle of Glières (30 January – 26 March)=====
=====Battle of Mont Mouchet (20 May – 22 June)=====
=====Battle of Saint-Marcel (18 June)=====
===== Battle of Mont Gargan (18–24 July) =====
In the , FTP forces () under Georges Guingouin fought the Wehrmacht brigade led by General Curt von Jesser.

====Campaign of France (1944–1945)====
By the time of the Normandy Invasion, the Free French forces numbered 500,000 regulars and more than 100,000 FFI (French Resistance). The Free French 2nd Armoured Division, under General Philippe Leclerc, landed at Utah Beach in Normandy on 2 August and eventually led the drive towards Paris later that month. The FFI began to seriously harass the German forces by cutting roads and railways, setting ambushes, and fighting battles alongside their allies.

===== French SAS Brittany airborne landings (5–18 June 1944) =====

====== Operation Samwest (5–9 June) ======
Operation Samwest (5–12 June 1944) was a large raid conducted by 116 Free French paratroopers of the 4th Special Air Service Regiment. Their objective was to hinder the movement of German troops from west Brittany to the Normandy beaches through ambush and sabotage attempts.

The first phase of the mission was to establish a secure base on the Breton Peninsula, near Saint-Brieuc in Duault. Their base was heavily attacked by German troops on 12 June, and they were forced to disperse.

====== Operation Dingson (5–18 June) ======

Free French airborne under Colonel Pierre-Louis Bourgoin dropped behind German lines in Brittany.

======Operation Cooney (7 June)======
===== Free French contribution to the Normandy naval landings (June 1944) =====

======French contribution on D-Day======
Only a few French infantry were involved in Operation Overlord, the Allied landing operations in Normandy on 6 June 1944. There were 209 infantry: 177 commandos and 32 airborne troopers. Additional personnel include a hundred French air force fighter and bomber pilots and hundreds of sailors from the French navy.

======The first to touch the ground of France======

Free French infantry fighting in the Normandy beaches on June 6 is limited to the 1er Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos (1er BFMC) under Free French Navy Major Philippe Kieffer.

The Free French Navy&#x27;s 1er BFMC comprised 177 commandos and had been created at Achnacarry, Scotland after the British Commandos. This All-French unit, including many Bretons as Brittany was close to England, was attached to the British No. 4 Commando under Lieutenant-Colonel Dawson. It was the very first infantry unit to touch the sand of Ouistreham, Normandy during Operation Overlord, preceding the 3rd British Infantry Division. This honor was a courtesy of 1st Special Service Brigade (S.S.B.) commander Scottish Brigadier Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat, who slowed down the British commandos landing crafts to let pass the French LCI 527 (Troop 1) and LCI 528 (Troop 8). The 1er BFMC&#x27;s Normandy campaign lasted 83 days. Casualty rate was high: from the 117 Kieffer commandos of June 6, only 24 survived.

====== Free French naval operations (3–16 June) ======

The Free French Navy under Admiral Ramsay took part in Operation Neptune which was the naval part of Operation Overlord, a series of missions were fulfilled on June 6:
* Juno Beach, French destroyer &quot;La Combattante&quot; under Commander André Patou shelled the German fortifications of Courseulles-sur-Mer while frigate &quot;La Découverte&quot; and corvette &quot;Commandant-d&#x27;Estienne-d&#x27;Orves&quot; escorted the Canadian infantry landing crafts.
* Gold Beach, the frigate &quot;La Surprise&quot; protected the British landing operation.
* Utah Beach, the corvettes &quot;L&#x27;Aconit&quot; and &quot;La Renoncule&quot; were in charge of patrolling against U-boats.
* Omaha Beach, in Vierville-sur-Mer, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, and Colleville-sur-Mer sectors, the frigates &quot;Escarmouche&quot;, &quot;Aventure,&quot; and the corvette &quot;Roselys&quot; escorted the US V Corps&#x27;s landing crafts.
* English Channel, eight fast patrol boats of the 23rd Flotilla patrolled for incoming German navy forces or sea mines.

Another French mission during 3–16 June consisted of the shelling of Omaha Beach&#x27;s defense by a fleet under Admiral Jaujard, which comprised the 7,500-ton cruisers &quot;Georges-Leygues&quot; and &quot;Montcalm&quot;, with their 10,000-ton tanker, and the cruiser &quot;Duquesne&quot;. The three cruisers fired thousands of shells in four days.

Defense operations were also performed by the corvettes and frigates establishing a shuttle between English harbours and the French coast. They escorted the logistics maneuvers involving infantry landing crafts, medical evacuations from the battlefield, and searching for Kriegsmarine menace.

On 9 June, the obsolete French cuirassé &quot;Courbet&quot; was disarmed and scuttled – together with other ships – in the Hermanville-sur-Mer area, to be used as artificial breakwaters.

======All-Free French air force operations======
Bomb group No. 342 Squadron RAF (GB 1/20 Lorraine), commanded by Michel Fouquet and equipped with Boston light bombers, supported the Omaha Beach invasion with a smoke screen campaign that blinded and isolated the German defenders.

Heavy bombers of bomb groups GB 1/15 Touraine and No. 347 Squadron RAF (GB 1/25 Tunisie) and fighters of No. 329 Squadron RAF (GC 1/2 Cigognes), No. 345 Squadron RAF (GC 2/2 Berry), No. 341 Squadron RAF (GC 3/2 Alsace), and No. 340 Squadron RAF (GC 4/2 Île de France) serviced under Air Marshal Leigh-Mallory.

The Free French airmen were part of the first casualties of Day-D. These include the flying crew Boissieux-Canut-Henson from bomb group No. 342 Squadron RAF (GB 1/20 Lorraine) which left its base at dawn and was KIA when its Boston was shot down.

=====Leclerc&#x27;s 2nd Armoured Division (August 1944 – January 1945)=====

The 2nd Division landed at Utah Beach on 1 August 1944, about two months after the D-Day landings, and served under General Patton&#x27;s Third Army.

======Battle for Normandy (July 1944)======
The 2nd Division played a critical role in Operation Cobra, the Allied breakthrough from Normandy, when it served as a link between American and Canadian armies and made rapid progress against German forces. They all but destroyed the 9th Panzer Division and defeated several other German units. During the Battle for Normandy, the 2nd Division suffered 133 men killed, 648 wounded, and 85 missing; material losses included 76 armored vehicles, 7 cannons, 27 halftracks, and 133 other vehicles. In the same period, the 2nd Division inflicted losses on the Germans of 4,500 killed and 8,800 taken prisoner, while the Germans&#x27; material losses in combat against the 2nd Division during the same period were 117 tanks, 79 cannons, and 750 wheeled vehicles.

====== Liberation of Paris (24–25 August 1944) ======
The most celebrated moment in the 2nd Division&#x27;s history involved the Liberation of Paris. Allied strategy emphasized destroying German forces retreating towards the Rhine, but when the French Resistance under Colonel Rol-Tanguy staged an uprising in the city, Charles de Gaulle pleaded with Eisenhower to send help. Eisenhower agreed and Leclerc&#x27;s forces headed for Paris. After hard fighting that cost the 2nd Division 35 tanks, 6 self-propelled guns, and 111 vehicles, von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, surrendered the city at the Hôtel Meurice. Jubilant crowds greeted French forces, and de Gaulle conducted a famous parade through the city.

======Lorraine Campaign, Liberation of Strasbourg (1944 – January 1945)======

Subsequently, the 2nd Division campaigned with American forces in Lorraine, spearheading the US Seventh Army&#x27;s drive through the northern Vosges Mountains and forcing the Saverne Gap. This continued with the liberation of Strasbourg in November 1944, the defence against the German Nordwind counter-offensive in Alsace in January 1945, and the operations against the Royan Pocket on the Atlantic coast of France.

=====Liberation of southern France (June–August 1944)=====

======Operation Jedburgh (June)======
Free French airborne commandos, called &quot;Jedburghs&quot;, were dropped behind Nazi lines in Provence in order to support the upcoming Allied landing (Operation Dragoon) and prepare the French Resistance. This Allied operation was in conjunction with the Free French intelligence service Bureau Central de Renseignements et d&#x27;Action (BCRA). Famous French Jedburghs include Jean Sassi and Paul Aussaresses.

======Battle for Provence (August)======

Operation Dragoon was the Allied invasion of southern France on 15 August 1944. The invasion took place between Toulon and Cannes. During the planning stages, the operation was known as &quot;Anvil&quot;, to complement &quot;Operation Hammer&quot;, which was at that time the codename for the invasion of Normandy. Subsequently, both plans were renamed, the latter becoming Operation Overlord, the former becoming Operation Dragoon; a name supposedly picked by Winston Churchill, who was opposed to the plan, and claimed to having been &quot;dragooned&quot; into accepting it.
The plan originally envisaged a mixture of Free French and American troops taking Toulon and later Marseille, with subsequent revisions encompassing Saint Tropez. The plan was revised throughout 1944, however, with conflict developing between British military staff — who were opposed to the landings, arguing that the troops and equipment should be either retained in Italy or sent there — and American military staff, who were in favour of the assault. This was part of a larger Anglo-American strategic disagreement.

The balance was tipped in favour of Operation Dragoon by two events: the eventual fall of Rome in early June, plus the success of Operation Cobra, the breakout from the Normandy pocket, at the end of the month. Operation Dragoon was set for August 15, 1944. The final go-ahead was given at short notice.
The US 6th Army Group, also known as the Southern Group of Armies, commanded by Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers, was created in Corsica and activated on 1 August 1944, to consolidate the combined French and American forces that were planning to invade southern France in Operation Dragoon. At first, it was subordinate to AFHQ (Allied Forces Headquarters) under the command of Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson who was the supreme commander of the Mediterranean Theater. One month after the invasion, command was handed over to SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces) under US General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of Allied forces on the Western Front.

The assault troops were formed of three American divisions of the VI Corps, reinforced by a French armoured division. The 3rd Infantry Division landed on the left at Alpha Beach (Cavalaire-sur-Mer), the 45th Infantry Division landed in the centre at Delta Beach (Saint-Tropez), and the 36th Infantry Division landed on the right at Camel Beach (Saint-Raphaël). These were supported by French commando groups landing on both flanks, and by Rugby Force, a parachute assault in the Le Muy-Le Luc area by the 1st Airborne Task Force: British 2nd Parachute Brigade, the US 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, and a composite US airborne glider regimental combat team formed from the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, the 550th Glider Infantry Battalion, and the 1st Battalion, 551st Parachute Infantry regiment. The 1st Special Service Force took two offshore islands to protect the beachhead.

Naval gunfire from Allied ships, including battleships &quot;Lorraine&quot;, , , , and and a fleet of over 50 cruisers and destroyers supported the landings. Seven Allied escort carriers provided air cover.

Over 94,000 troops and 11,000 vehicles were landed on the first day. A number of German troops had been diverted to fight the Allied forces in Northern France after Operation Overlord and a major attack by French resistance fighters, coordinated by Captain Aaron Bank of the OSS, helped drive the remaining German forces back from the beachhead in advance of the landing. As a result, the Allied forces met little resistance as they moved inland. The quick success of this invasion, with a twenty-mile penetration in twenty-four hours, sparked a major uprising by resistance fighters in Paris.

Follow-up formations included US VI Corps HQ, US Seventh Army HQ, French Army B (later redesignated the &quot;French First Army&quot;), and French I and II Corps.
The rapid retreat of the German Nineteenth Army resulted in swift gains for the Allied forces. The plans had envisaged greater resistance near the landing areas and underestimated transport needs. The consequent need for vehicle fuel outstripped supply, and this shortage proved to be a greater impediment to the advance than German resistance. As a result, several German formations escaped into the Vosges and Germany.

The Dragoon force met up with southern thrusts from Overlord in mid-September, near Dijon. Operation Dragoon included a glider landing (Operation Dove) and a deception (Operation Span).

A planned benefit of Dragoon was the usefulness of the port of Marseille. The rapid Allied advance after Operations Cobra and Dragoon slowed almost to a halt in September 1944 due to a critical lack of supplies, as thousands of tons of supplies were shunted to northwest France to compensate for the inadequacies of port facilities and land transport in northern Europe. Marseille and the southern French railways were brought back into service despite heavy damage to the Port of Marseille and its railroad trunk lines. They became a significant supply route for the Allied advance into Germany, providing about a third of the Allied needs.

======Operation Romeo (15 August 1944)======

French commandos assaulted German artillery position at . 300 German soldiers were killed and 700 were taken prisoner. The French commandos suffered 11 men killed and 50 wounded.

======Liberation of Toulon and Marseilles======

The French First Army under Jean de Lattre de Tassigny performed spectacularly in the capture of Toulon and Marseilles. The original plan intended to attack the two ports in succession. The accelerated landings of de Lattre&#x27;s French forces and the general situation, however, allowed concurrent operations against both. De Lattre ordered Lieutenant General Edgard de Larminat to move west against Toulon along the coast, with two infantry divisions supported by tanks and commandos. Simultaneously, a second force, under Major General Goislard de Monsabert and consisting of one infantry division and similar supporting forces, would advance in a more northwesterly direction, encircling the naval port from the north and west and probing toward Marseille. De Lattre knew that the German garrisons at the ports were substantial: some 18,000 troops of all types at Toulon and another 13,000 (mostly army) at Marseille. However, Resistance sources also told him that the defenders had not yet put much effort into protecting the landward approaches to the ports, and he was convinced that a quick strike by experienced combat troops might well crack their defenses before they had a chance to coalesce. Speed was essential.

On the morning of 20 August, with the German command in Toulon still in a state of confusion and the Nineteenth Army more concerned with Truscott&#x27;s westward progress well north of the port, de Larminat attacked from the east while Monsabert circled around to the north, quickly outflanking Toulon&#x27;s hasty defenses along the coast. By 21 August, Monsabert had cut the Toulon-Marseille road, and several of his units had entered Toulon from the west, penetrating to within two miles of the main waterfront. Between 21 and 23 August, the French slowly squeezed the Germans back into the inner city in a series of almost continuous street fights. As the German defense lost coherence, isolated groups began to surrender, with the last organized resistance ending on the 26th and the formal German surrender occurring on 28 August. The battle cost de Lattre about 2,700 casualties, but the French claimed 17,000 prisoners, indicating that few Germans had followed the Fuehrer&#x27;s &quot;stand and die&quot; order.

Even as French forces occupied Toulon, Monsabert began the attack on Marseille, generally screening German defenses along the coast and striking from the northeastern and northern approaches. Early gains on 22 August put French troops within five to eight miles of the city&#x27;s center, while a major Resistance uprising within the port encouraged French soldiers to strike deeper.

Although de Lattre urged caution, concerned over the dispersion of his forces and the shortage of fuel for his tanks and trucks, Monsabert&#x27;s infantry plunged into the heart of Marseille in the early hours of 23 August. Their initiative decided the issue, and the fighting soon became a matter of battling from street to street and from house to house, as in Toulon. On the evening of the 27th, the German commander parleyed with Monsabert to arrange terms and a formal surrender became effective on the 28th, the same day as the capitulation of Toulon. At Marseille, the French took over 1,800 casualties and acquired roughly 11,000 more prisoners. Equally important, both ports, although badly damaged by German demolitions, were in Allied hands many weeks ahead of schedule.

=====Liberation of north-eastern France (September 1944 – March 1945)=====
Moving north, the French First Army liberated Lyon on 2 September 1944 and moved into the southern Vosges Mountains, capturing Belfort and forcing the Belfort Gap at the close of November 1944. Following the capture of the Belfort Gap, French operations in the area of Burnhaupt destroyed the German IV Luftwaffe Korps. In February 1945, with the assistance of the US XXI Corps, the First Army collapsed the Colmar Pocket and cleared the west bank of the Rhine River of Germans in the area south of Strasbourg.

====Western Allied invasion of Germany (1945)====
=====First French Army in west Germany (March–April 1945)=====
In March 1945, the First Army fought through the Siegfried Line fortifications in the Bienwald Forest near Lauterbourg. Subsequently, the First Army crossed the Rhine near Speyer and captured Karlsruhe and Stuttgart. Operations by the First Army in April 1945 encircled and captured the German XVIII. S.S.-Armeekorps in the Black Forest and cleared southwestern Germany.

=====Normandie-Niemen air raids over Königsberg (April 1945)=====

Free French &quot;Normandie-Niemen&quot; squadron&#x27;s flag features Battle of Königsberg 1945 as battle honor and the unit was awarded the &quot;Take of the Königsberg Fortress&quot; medal.

=====Free French Division Leclerc at Berchtesgaden (4 May 1945)=====

General Leclerc&#x27;s 2nd Division finished its campaigning at the Nazi resort town of Berchtesgaden, in southeastern Germany, where Hitler&#x27;s mountain residence, the Berghof, was located. Leclerc&#x27;s armoured unit was along the US 3rd Infantry Division.

=====French Army of Africa&#x27;s 7e RCA at Württemberg (1945)=====

====Campaign of the Netherlands (1945)====

===== French SAS Operation Amherst (7–8 April 1945) =====

The operation began with the drop of 700 Special Air Service troopers of 3rd and 4th French SAS on the night of 7 April 1945. The teams spread out to capture and protect key facilities from the Germans. Advancing Canadian troops of the 8th Reconnaissance Regiment relieved the isolated French SAS.

====Liberation of Belgium====

=====Battle of the Bulge (1944–1945)=====

Two French Light Infantry Battalions (J. Lawton Collins&#x27;s VII Corps (United States)) and six French Light Infantry Battalions from Metz region (Troy H. Middleton&#x27;s VIII Corps (United States)) fought the Battle of the Bulge. The 3rd SAS French 1st Airborne Marine Infantry Regiment battle honor bears the Battle of Bulge (&quot;Ardennes Belges 1945&quot;&quot;).

===English Channel and North Sea===

====&quot;British treachery&quot; over Free French navy (3 July – 31 August 1940)====
On 3 July 1940, Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the capture of French ships by the British as Operation Catapult. This included not only the enemy Vichy French ships in the Mediterranean (see Battle of Mers-el-Kebir) but also the allied Free French ships docked in Britain after the Dunkirk evacuation. The capture by force of docked ships led to fighting between Free French sailors and outnumbering British Marines, sailors, and soldiers in the English harbours. A similar operation was executed in Canada. The British assault on the then world&#x27;s largest submarine resulted in three dead British (2 Royal Navy officers and 1 British seaman) and one dead Free French (warrant officer mechanic Yves Daniel).

Commandeered Free French vessels included which was captured by the British at Plymouth. Because of the complexity of her handling and of the need to support the Free France, &quot;Le Triomphant&quot; was handed to the Free French Naval Forces (FNFL) on 28 August 1940 and put under the command of captain Pierre Gilly. Her aft gun was replaced by a British model. was under repair at Portsmouth after the Dunkirk evacuation when she was captured by the British. She was handed over to the FNFL on 31 August. also under repair at Plymouth, along with her sister ship , eight torpedo boats, five submarines and a number of other ships of lesser importance. Britain planned to transfer her to the Polish Navy. The ceremony was to be held on 15 July 1940 and it was planned to rename the ship to OF &quot;Paris&quot; (OF – Okręt Francuski – &quot;French ship&quot;) but due to lack of personnel the ship was never handed over to the Polish Navy and was instead used by the British as an accommodation ship in Devonport.

The commandeered was not returned to the Free French but instead was transferred to the Polish Navy on 17 July 1940. Until 30 April 1941, she sailed under the Polish ensign with pennant number H16, but as OF &quot;Ouragan&quot; (OF – Okręt Francuski – &quot;French ship&quot;), instead of the usual ORP prefix. It was only after 287 days that &quot;Ouragan&quot; was returned to her owner, on 30 April 1941.

After the capture of Allied French ships, Britain tried to repatriate the captured Free French sailors. The British hospital ship that was carrying them back to metropolitan France was sunk by the Germans, and many of the French blamed the British for their deaths.

Operation Catapult was called treachery by both the Vichy and Free French. The French State exploited this series of events in its anti-British propaganda, which has a long-running history dating back to the Perfidious Albion myth.

===Atlantic===
====Battle of the Atlantic====

The French Navy took part in the naval Battle of the Atlantic from 1939 to 1940. After the armistice of June 1940, Free French Naval Forces, headed by admiral Émile Muselier, were created and pursued the war on the Allies side.

==== Last battle of the battleship Bismarck (26–27 May 1941) ====

The Free French Navy&#x27;s submarine &quot;Minerve&quot; was involved in the Allied battle against the &quot;Bismarck&quot;.

====Free French rescue of British Convoy HG-75 (24 October 1941)====

On 24 October 1941, the attacked Allied Convoy HG-75, which was sailing from Almería, Spain, to Barrow-in-Furness, England. &quot;U-564&quot; fired five torpedoes, hitting and sinking three cargo ships: , , and . There were 18 survivors from &quot;Carsbreck&quot;, and all were rescued by the Free French &quot;Elan&quot;-class minesweeping aviso &quot;Commandant Duboc&quot; (F743).

====Laconia incident (12 September 1942)====

Vichy French ships were involved with the Laconia incident.

===Mediterranean, Middle East, and African===
====Naval battle of the Mediterranean (1940–1945)====

Both the Vichy French Navy and Free French Navy fought the Battle of the Mediterranean sea. A notable action, the Battle off Ist, took place on the Adriatic sea on 29 February 1944, when a German naval force of two corvettes and two torpedo boats escorting a freighter, supported by three minesweepers, was intercepted by the Free French Navy operating under British command as the 24th Destroyer flotilla. Under Captain Pierre Lancelot, the &quot;Super&quot; (or heavy) Le Fantasque-class destroyers and destroyed the German freighter and one of the corvettes before withdrawing with no casualties.

====Naval battle of Mers El Kébir (3 July 1940)====
The British began to doubt Admiral Darlan&#x27;s promise to Churchill to not allow the French fleet at Toulon to fall into German hands by the wording of the armistice conditions. In the end, the British attacked French naval forces in Africa and Europe, killing 1,000 French soldiers at Mers El Kebir alone. This action led to feelings of animosity and mistrust between the Vichy French and their former British allies. In the course of the war, Vichy France lost 2,653 soldiers and Free France lost 20,000.

In German or Italian hands, the French fleet would have been a grave threat to Britain and the British Government declined to take this risk. To neutralise the threat, Winston Churchill ordered that the French ships should rejoin the Allies, agree to be put out of use in a British, French, or neutral port, or, as a last resort, be destroyed by British attack (Operation Catapult). The Royal Navy attempted to persuade the French Navy to agree to these terms, but when that failed, they attacked the French Navy 3 July 1940 at Mers El Kébir and Dakar. This caused bitterness and division in France, particularly in the Navy, and discouraged many French soldiers from joining the Free French forces in Britain. Also, the attempt to persuade Vichy French forces in Dakar to join de Gaulle failed.

==== Sabotage operation in Greece (12–13 June 1942) ====

In June 1942, British SAS C.O. David Stirling gave British captains George Jellicoe and Free French Georges Bergé a mission on the Greek island of Crete called Operation Heraklion. Bergé chose three Free French commandos, Jacques Mouhot, Pierre Léostic, and Jack Sibard; Lieutenant Kostis Petrakis of the Greek Army in the Middle East, a native of Crete, joined them.

They managed to destroy 22 Junkers Ju 88 German bombers at the Candia-Heraklion airfield. However, their retreat was betrayed and 17-year-old Pierre Léostic refused to surrender and was killed, while the other three Free French were caught and transferred to Germany. The British and Cretan commandos escaped and were evacuated to Egypt. Jacques Mouhot tried and failed three times to escape, but succeeded on his fourth attempt. He subsequently crossed Germany, Belgium, France, and Spain to arrive in London on 22 August 1943.

====Scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon (27 November 1942)====

The Vichy French navy sabotaged its docked fleet at Toulon in southern France, to prevent the German Kriegsmarine from seizing Vichy French ships and using their firepower against the Allies and Free French.

====Allied invasion of Sicily (9 July – 17 August 1943)====
Operation Husky involved infantry, air force, and armored cavalry forces from the Army of Africa, including 4th Moroccan Tabor (66th, 67th, and 68th Goums landed on July 13 at Licata) from the Seventh United States Army, French II/5 &quot;LaFayette&quot; Squadron with Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, No. II/7 &quot;Nice&quot; French Squadron with Spitfires (both from No. 242 Group RAF), II/33 Groupe &quot;Savoie&quot; with P-38 Lightning from the Northwest African Photographic Reconnaissance Wing, and 131st RCC with Renault R35 tanks.

====Liberation of Corsica (September–October 1943)====

In September–October 1943, an ad hoc force of about 6,000 troops of the French 1st Corps liberated Corsica, which was defended by the German 90th Panzergrenadier Division and the Sturmbrigade Reichsführer-SS totalling about 30,000 troops. Although 45,000 Italians were also present, some joined the Allies. Corsica became the first French &quot;metropolitan department&quot; liberated in World War II (the first liberated was Algiers, in November 1942).

===African===

==== West African campaign ====

===== Battle of Dakar (23–25 September 1940) =====

The Battle of Dakar, also known as Operation Menace, was an unsuccessful attempt by the Allies to capture the strategic port of Dakar in French West Africa (modern-day Senegal), which was under Vichy French control, and to install the Free French under General Charles de Gaulle there. De Gaulle believed that he could persuade the Vichy French forces in Dakar to join the Allies. There were several advantages to this: the political consequences if another Vichy French colony changed sides, and also more practical advantages, such as the presence of the gold reserves of the Banque de France and the Polish government in exile in Dakar. Militarily, the port of Dakar had a better location for protecting the convoys sailing around Africa than Freetown, the base the Allies were then using.

The Allies decided to send an aircraft carrier, two battleships (of World War I vintage), four cruisers, and ten destroyers to Dakar. Several transports would carry the 8,000 troops. Their orders were first to try and negotiate with the Vichy French governor, but, if this was unsuccessful, to take the city by force.
The Vichy French forces present at Dakar were led by the battleship &quot;Richelieu&quot;, one of the most advanced in the French fleet. It had left Brest on 18 June before the Germans reached it. &quot;Richelieu&quot; was then only about 95% complete. Before the establishment of the Vichy government, , an aircraft carrier, had been operating with French forces in Dakar. Once the Vichy regime was in power, &quot;Hermes&quot; left port but remained on watch, and was joined by the Australian heavy cruiser, . Planes from &quot;Hermes&quot; had attacked the &quot;Richelieu&quot;, and it was struck once with a torpedo. The French ship was immobilised but was able to function as a floating gun battery. Three Vichy submarines and several lighter ships were also at Dakar. A force of three cruisers (the &quot;Gloire&quot;, &quot;Georges Leygues&quot;, and &quot;Montcalm&quot;) and three destroyers had left Toulon for Dakar just a few days earlier. The &quot;Gloire&quot; was slowed by mechanical troubles, and was intercepted by &quot;Australia&quot; and ordered to sail for Casablanca. The other two cruisers and the destroyers outran the pursuing Allied cruisers and reached Dakar safely.

On 23 September, the Fleet Air Arm dropped propaganda leaflets on the city. Free French aircraft flew off from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and landed at the airport, but the crews were taken prisoner. A boat with representatives of de Gaulle entered the port but were fired upon. At 10:00, Vichy French ships trying to leave the port were given warning shots from &quot;Australia&quot;. The ships returned to port but the coastal forts opened fire on &quot;Australia&quot;. This led to an engagement between the battleships and cruisers and the forts. In the afternoon, &quot;Australia&quot; intercepted and fired on the Vichy destroyer &quot;&quot;, setting it on fire and causing it to beach.

In the afternoon, an attempt was made to set Free French troops ashore on a beach at Rufisque, to the north-east of Dakar, but they came under heavy fire from strong points defending the beach. De Gaulle declared he did not want to &quot;shed the blood of Frenchmen for Frenchmen&quot; and the attack was called off.

For the next two days, the Allied fleet attacked the coastal defences, as the Vichy French tried to prevent them. Two Vichy French submarines were sunk, and a destroyer damaged. After the Allied fleet also took heavy damage to both battleships and two cruisers, they withdrew, leaving Dakar and French West Africa in Vichy French hands.

The effects of the Allied failure were mostly political. De Gaulle had believed that he would be able to persuade the Vichy French at Dakar to change sides, but this turned out not to be the case, which damaged his standing with the Allies.

===== Battle of Gabon (8–10 November 1940) =====

The Battle of Gabon, in November 1940, was a successful attempt to rally the French African colony. On 27 October, Free French forces crossed into French Equatorial Africa and took the town of Mitzic. On 5 November, the Vichy garrison at Lambaréné capitulated. Meanwhile, the main Free French force under General Philippe Leclerc and Battalion Chief (major) Marie Pierre Koenig left Douala, French Cameroon to take Libreville, French Equatorial Africa. The British doubted de Gaulle, but eventually agreed to lend naval support.

On 8 November 1940, the Shoreham-class sloop &quot;HMS Milford&quot; found and pursued a Vichy submarine, &quot;Poncelet&quot;. The &quot;Milford&quot; was too slow to intercept it, so Admiral Cunningham ordered his flagship, HMS Devonshire, to launch its Supermarine Walrus biplane. The aircraft straddled the submarine with 100 lb depth charges as it dove, damaging it. The submarine and its captain went down off Port-Gentil.

Koenig landed at Pointe La Mondah on the night of 8 November with a force that included Senegalese and Cameroonian troops, and French Legionnaires from the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade. On 9 November, Free French Westland Lysander aircraft out of Douala bombed Libreville aerodrome. Koenig&#x27;s forces eventually captured the aerodrome, despite stiff resistance. Free French naval minesweeper &quot;Commandant Dominé&quot; and cargo vessel &quot;Casamance&quot; conducted coastal operations, led by Georges Thierry d&#x27;Argenlieu aboard the Bougainville-class aviso &quot;Savorgnan de Brazza&quot;. &quot;De Brazza&quot; attacked and sank her sister ship, the Vichy French &quot;Bougainville&quot;. The Free French took Libreville on 10 November.

On 12 November, the last Vichy forces at Port Gentil surrendered, and Governor Georges Pierre Masson committed suicide. Writers differ on the casualties. De Gaulle said &quot;some twenty&quot; died in this campaign, and claimed thirty-three. Eliane Ebako wrote that &quot;dozens&quot; died, while Jean-Pierre Azéma has said that &quot;roughly one hundred&quot; died. Another narrative says 35 Vichy troops were killed, and eight Free French, and yet another, that the Free French lost four aircraft and six men.

On 15 November, de Gaulle invited captured soldiers – including General Marcel Têtu – to join the Free French. Most of the prisoners of war refused and remained for the rest of the war interned in Brazzaville, French Congo. With their control in Equatorial Africa consolidated, the Free French turned to the campaign in Italian Libya. De Gaulle sent General Leclerc to Fort Lamy, Chad to oversee the preparations. The fighting triggered a mass migration of Gabonese to Spanish Guinea. French Equatorial Africa cut ties with Vichy-controlled West Africa, and rebuilt its economy around trade with its British neighbors, particularly Nigeria. Tensions between Vichy and the Free French persisted long after this invasion, but its win in French Equatorial Africa gave Free France a new-found legitimacy; it was no longer just an exile organization in London.

==== East African Campaign ====
The East African campaign of the Second World War was fought by Allies, mainly troops from the British Empire, against Italy and its colony, Italian East Africa, between June 1940 and November 1941. The British Middle East Command, with troops from the United Kingdom, South Africa, British India, Uganda Protectorate, Kenya, Somaliland, West Africa, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Sudan, and Nyasaland participated in the campaign. These were joined by the Allied Force Publique of Belgian Congo, the Imperial Ethiopian Arbegnoch (resistance forces), and a small unit of Free French.

Italian East Africa was defended by the Comando Forze Armate dell&#x27;Africa Orientale Italiana (Italian East African Armed Forces Command), with units from the Regio Esercito (Royal Army), Regia Aeronautica (Royal Air Force), and Regia Marina (Royal Navy). The Italian forces included about 250,000 soldiers of the Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali (Royal Corps of Colonial Troops), led by Italian officers and NCOs. With Britain in control of the Suez Canal, the Italian forces were cut off from supplies and reinforcement once hostilities began.

On 13 June 1940, an Italian air raid took place on the RAF base at Wajir in Kenya and the air war continued until Italian forces had been pushed back from Kenya and Sudan, through Somaliland, Eritrea, and Ethiopia in 1940 and early 1941. The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the Battle of Gondar in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a guerrilla war in Ethiopia against the British until the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt. Most Commonwealth forces were transferred to North Africa to participate in the Western Desert campaign.

=====Eithrea–Ethiopia campaign (1941)=====
Free French colonial forces from the Brigade of the East () under Colonel Monclar—including the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade () and the (from Chad)—fought Italian troops in their colonies of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the Vichy French Forces of French Somaliland.

======Battle of Keren (3 February – 1 April 1941)======
The battle was fought from 5 February to 1 April 1941 between a mixed Italian army of regular and colonial troops and the attacking British, Commonwealth, and Free French forces.

==== North African campaign and Desert War ====

Operation Torch, a large-scale Allied invasion of the French protectorate in Morocco and the French &quot;départements&quot; of Algeria, took place in November 1942. Naval and airborne landings of American and British troops opposed Vichy French forces. The French Resistance set up a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against both Vichy French governors; one failed and the other succeeded.

Operation Torch rallied the Army of Africa to the Free French cause and also infuriated Hitler, who ordered the occupation of the rest of metropolitan France (the &quot;free zone&quot;), as well as air raids against French Algerian cities by the Libya-based Luftwaffe.

=====North African Free French Air Force (July 1940 – 1945)=====

In July 1940, there were sufficient Free French pilots in African colonial bases to man several squadrons based in French North Africa. On 8 July 1940, Free French Flight units based in Middle-Eastern French colonies were created. They were initially equipped with a mixture of British, French, and American aircraft. From a strength of 500 in July 1940, the ranks of the Free French Air Force () (FAFL) grew to 900 by 1941, including 200 fliers.

In addition to the FAFL air force, the Free French Naval Air Service also existed. On 3 August 1943, de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French forces merged with Giraud&#x27;s Army of Africa.

===== French Morocco-Algeria campaign (1942) =====

====== Coup of Casablanca (7 November) ======
On the night of 7 November − the eve of Operation Torch − pro-Allied French General Antoine Béthouart attempted a coup d&#x27;état against the Vichy French command in Morocco, so that he could surrender to the Allies the next day. His forces surrounded the villa of General Charles Noguès, the Vichy-loyal high commissioner. However, Noguès telephoned loyal forces, who stopped the coup. In addition, the coup attempt alerted Noguès to the impending Allied invasion, and he immediately bolstered French coastal defenses.

====== Allied invasion of French Morocco ======
====== Naval battle of Casablanca (8–16 November) ======
====== Battle of Port Lyautey (8–12 November) ======
The Northern Attack Group, Sub Task Force Goalpost, arrived off Mehdia, Morocco just before midnight 7/8 November 1942. The battleship and light cruiser took up station to the north and south of the landing beaches. The transport ships had lost formation as they approached Morocco, and had not regained it by the time they arrived. The Mediterranean landings were well advanced before those at Mehdia commenced. Surprise was lost.

Defenses at Mehdia were lightly manned. Naval crews operated two guns in protected positions, on the mesa above the village and near the kasbah. No more than 70 men occupied the fort when the attack started. Two guns were mounted on flat cars on the railroad running along the river. A second battery of four 75 mm guns came forward after the attack began, to a position on the high ground along the road from Mehdia to Port Lyautey.

At first light on the 8th, coastal batteries and warships began to fire and French airplanes to strafe. Colonel Demas T. Craw and Major Pierpont M. Hamilton went by jeep from the beach landing to Port Lyautey to see the French commander, Colonel Charles Petit. They were to give him a diplomatic letter, in hope of preventing any hostilities. As they neared the town under a flag of truce, a French machine gunner fired point-blank, killing Colonel Craw. Major Hamilton was then taken to Colonel Petit, who had no conclusive reply. While sympathetic to the Allied cause and reluctant to fight, he lacked the authority to stop it. Units of the 60th Infantry Regiment began disembarking troops and supplies. The first wave of landing boats began circling and preparing to land, but were delayed as they looked for guidance from shore; yet the second wave pressed onshore as planned, on time, so the second wave began their attack, as the first wave started in toward its objectives. Confusion ruled. As the first wave made shore, small arms fire and cannon fire began from a kasbah overlooking the area. On that first day, the 60th Regiment achieved their first objective, securing the beach, but no others. That night was stormy; men tried to rest anywhere, and many searched through the blackness to find their units.

On the second day, 9 November, attacks on the kasbah continued. The attackers took the ground around the fortress, but it still successfully defended itself and repulsed a number of attacks. The American attackers had not yet succeeded. On the third day, 10 November, they captured the fortress and the local airfield, leading to a truce on 11 November.

A battery of four guns (Grandes Puissances Filloux) sat on a hill west of Port Lyautey and southwest of the airport. The airport was defended by a single anti-aircraft battery. The infantry consisted of the 1st Regiment of Moroccan Infantry and the 8th Tabor (battalion) of native Goums. One group of nine guns had withdrawn from other infantry regiments and one battalion of engineers completed the defensive force. Reinforcements were sent to occupy the entrenchments and machine gun positions which covered approaches to the coastal guns and the fort and to occupy defensive positions on the ridges east of the lagoon.

In Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, 8 November 1942, Allied infantry landed in the Vichy French port of Algiers intending to capture the port facilities before they could be destroyed.

====== Coup of Algiers ======
As agreed at Cherchell, starting at midnight and continuing through the early hours of 8 November, as the invasion troops were approaching the shore, a group of 400 French resistance under the command of Henri d&#x27;Astier de la Vigerie and José Aboulker staged a coup in the city of Algiers. They seized key targets, including the telephone exchange, radio station, governor&#x27;s house, and the headquarters of 19th Corps. American ambassador Robert Murphy drove to the home of General Alphonse Juin, the senior French Army officer in North Africa, with some resistance fighters who surrounded the house, making Juin effectively a prisoner. Murphy tried to persuade him to side with the Allies. However, Admiral François Darlan, the commander of all French forces, was in Algiers on a private visit. Juin insisted on contacting Darlan, and Murphy was unable to persuade either to side with the Allies. In the early morning, the gendarmerie arrived and released Juin and Darlan.

====== Allied invasion of Oran ======
=====French Tunisia campaign (1942–1943)=====
Giraud&#x27;s Army of Africa fought in Tunisia (late North African Campaign) alongside de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French Forces, the British 1st Army and the US II Corps for six months until April 1943. Using antiquated equipment, they took heavy casualties (16,000) against modern armour of the German enemy.

======Run for Tunis (10 November – 25 December 1942)======
====== Battle of the Kasserine Pass (19–25 February 1943) ======
======Battle of Medenine (6 March 1943)======
====== Operation Pugilist (16–27 March 1943) ======

The Operation Pugilist involves the Free French Flying Column (X Corps (United Kingdom), British Eighth Army under General Sir Bernard Montgomery) and Leclerc&#x27;s Force (2nd Division (New Zealand)).

=====Libya campaign=====

======Battle of Kufra (31 January – 1 March 1941)======

Though France had fallen, her flag still flew from the isolated but strategically important ex-Italian fort of El Tag, which dominated the Kufra oasis in southern Libya.

Colonel Leclerc and the intrepid Lieutenant Colonel d&#x27;Ornano, commander of French Forces in Chad, were tasked with attacking Italian positions in Libya with the motley forces at their disposal in Chad, which had declared for Free France. Kufra was the obvious target. The task of striking at the heavily defended oasis at Kufra was made all the more difficult by the inadequate transport. The sand dunes and the rocky Fech Fech were considered impassable for vehicles. Major Clayton of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) assisted, with his G (Guards) and T (New Zealand) patrols, a total of seventy-six men in twenty-six vehicles. They mounted a raid against the airfield at the oasis of Murzuk, capital of the Fezzan region of Libya. Ten Free French (three officers, two sergeants, and five native soldiers) under d&#x27;Ornano met with Clayton&#x27;s LRDG patrols on 6 January 1941 at Kayouge. Their combined force reached Murzuk on 11 January. In a daring daylight raid, they surprised the sentries and swept through the oasis, devastating the base. The majority of the force attacked the main fort, while a troop from T patrol under Lieutenant Ballantyne engaged the airfield defences, destroying three Caproni aircraft and capturing a number of prisoners.

The success of the raid was tempered by the loss of d&#x27;Ornano and a T patrol member. Leclerc assumed overall command and marshalled his forces to take Kufra. A diversionary raid by mounted Meharistes colonial cavalry failed after it was betrayed by local guides, so Leclerc relegated these men to recon duties only. Intelligence indicated that the oasis had two defensive lines based around the El Tag fort with barbed wire, trenches, machine guns, and light anti-aircraft defences. The garrison was thought to comprise a battalion of Askaris (Colonial Infantry) under Colonel Leo, plus supporting troops. The oasis was also defended by &quot;La Compania Sahariana de Cufra&quot;, a specialized mobile force and the forerunner of the famous &quot;Sahariana&quot; companies of the mid-war period. The company was composed of desert veterans crewing various Fiat and Lancia trucks equipped with HMGs and 20 mm anti-aircraft weapons, together with some armoured cars. The company also had the support of its own air arm to assist in long range reconnaissance and ground attack.

Leclerc could not pinpoint the Saharianas, so he tasked the LRDG with hunting them down and robbing the defenders of their mobile reserve. Unfortunately for the LRDG, a radio intercept unit at Kufra picked up their radio traffic and they were spotted from the air. The defenders had been on their guard since Murzuk. G patrol had been kept in reserve and Major Clayton was leading T patrol, 30 men in 11 trucks. The patrol was at Bishara on the morning of January 31 when an Italian aircraft appeared overhead. The trucks scattered and made for some hills, and the plane flew away without attacking. The patrol took cover among some rocks in a small wadi at Gebel Sherif and camouflaged the trucks. The plane returned and circled over the wadi, directing a patrol of the Auto-Saharan Company to their location. The LRDG patrol came off second best to superior Italian firepower and constant air attack. After severe losses, the surviving seven trucks of the patrol withdrew, leaving behind their commanding officer, who was captured along with several others. Other survivors embarked on epic journeys to seek safety. After this defeat, the LRDG had to withdraw and refit, leaving Leclerc one LRDG vehicle from T patrol, crucially equipped for desert navigation. Leclerc pressed on, even though a copy of his plan had been captured with Major Clayton. After further reconnaissance, Leclerc abandoned his two armoured cars and took with him the remaining serviceable artillery piece, a crucial decision. On the 17th, Leclerc&#x27;s forces brushed with the Saharianas and despite a disparity in firepower were able to drive them off, as the Kufra garrison failed to intervene. Following this, El Tag was surrounded, despite a further attack from the Saharans and harassment from the air, and the French laid siege to the fort. The lone 75 mm gun was placed from the fort, beyond range of the defences, and accurately delivered 20 shells per day at regular intervals.

Despite their superior numbers, Italian resolve faltered. Negotiations to surrender began on 28 February and finally, on 1 March 1941, the Free French captured El Tag and the oasis at Kufra.

======Battle of Gazala (26 May – 21 June 1942)======
======Battle of Bir Hakeim (26 May – 11 June 1942)======
The Battle of Bir Hakeim was fought between the Afrika Korps and the Free French Brigade, with support from the British 7th Armoured Division. The German commander was Generaloberst Erwin Rommel and the French commander was General Marie Pierre Koenig. The outnumbered Free French Brigade heroically resisted for sixteen days, allowing Allied Forces to regroup and prepare for the battle of El Alamein.

The Germans attacked Bir Hakeim on 26 May 1942. Over the next two weeks, the Luftwaffe flew 1,400 sorties against the defences, whilst four German–Italian divisions attacked. On June 2, 3, and 5, the German forces requested that Koenig surrender. He refused and launched counterattacks with his Bren gun carriers. Despite the explosion of the defence&#x27;s ammunition dump, the French continued to fight using ammunition brought in by British armoured cars during the night. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force dropped water and other supplies.

On June 9, the British Eighth Army authorized a retreat and during the night of 10/11 June the defenders of Bir Hakeim escaped.

Subordinate units of the defending 1st Free French Brigade were:
* 2nd and 3rd battalions of the 13th half-brigade of the Foreign Legion
* 1st battalion of naval fusiliers
* 1st battalion of marine infantry
* the Pacific battalion
* 2nd march battalion of Oubangui-Chari
* 1st Artillery Regiment
* 22nd North African company (6 sections)
* 1st company (engineers)
* signals company
* 101st transport company (trains/automobiles)
* a light medical ambulance

=====Egypt campaign=====

====== Italian invasion of British Egypt (9–16 September 1940) ======
======Operation Compass (8 December 1940 – 9 February 1941)======
======Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October – 5 November 1942)======
===Middle East===
====French Syria–Lebanon Campaign (1941)====

Free French forces faced Vichy Army of the Levant under General Henri Dentz during the Allied campaign set in French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon.

=====Battle of the Litani River (9 June)=====
=====Battle of Jezzine (13 June)=====
===== Battle of Kissoué (15–17 June) =====

The Battle of Kissoué was part of the Allied advance on Damascus in Syria during the Syria–Lebanon campaign. In the battle, the Free French met with stiff resistance from the Vichy French.

On 8 June 1941, the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Wilfrid Lewis Lloyd crossed into Syria from the British Mandate of Palestine to take Quneitra and Deraa and clear the way for Free French forces to advance from there to Damascus. This was one of four attacks planned by Allied general Henry Maitland Wilson. By 12 June, Daraa, Sheikh Meskine, and Ezraa on the Deraa-to-Damascus road had been captured, and the Indian and Free French forces were at Kissoué, a strong defensive position with plentiful cover for infantry and tanks, and strong defensive works on the steeply rising Jebel el Kelb and Jebel Abou Atriz. Boulder-strewn, virtually impassable except by road, and difficult even on foot, the hills of Tel Kissoué, Tel Afar, and Jebel Madani commanded the roads from both Quneitra and Daraa to Damascus.

===== Battle of Damascus (18–21 June) =====
=====Battle of Merdjayoun (19–24 June)=====
=====Battle of Palmyra (1 July)=====
=====Battle of Deir ez-Zor (3 July)=====
===== Battle of Damour (5–9 July) =====
====Syrian Crisis (May–June 1945)====

By 1945, continued French presence in the Levant saw nationalist demonstrations which the French tried to quell. With heavy civilian losses, Winston Churchill in June – despite being rebuffed by Charles de Gaulle – ordered British forces into Syria from Jordan with orders to impose a ceasefire. British forces then reached Damascus, following which the French were escorted and confined to their barracks. With political pressure added, de Gaulle ordered a ceasefire and France withdrew from Syria the following year.

===Indian Ocean===

====Allies invade French Madagascar (5 May – 8 November 1942)====

In May 1942&#x27;s Operation Ironclad, the Allies attacked the French colony of Madagascar, defended by Japanese miniature submarines and Vichy French forces. By March 1942, submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy freely roamed the north and eastern Indian Ocean, and Japanese aircraft carriers raided shipping in the Bay of Bengal and bases in Colombo and Trincomalee, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), driving the British Eastern Fleet to relocate to Kilindini Harbour in Mombasa, Kenya. Because of the range of Japanese Kaidai-type submarines – sometimes more than 10,000 miles (16,000 km) – Japanese forward bases on Madagascar could have threatened Allied merchant shipping and the supply route of the British Eighth Army and the Eastern Fleet, and affected Allied lines of communication from Australia and the Pacific to the Middle East and the South Atlantic.

South African Air Force (SAAF) reconnaissance led to landings in assault craft, just west of the port of Diego-Suarez on the northern tip of Madagascar, by the British 29th Infantry Brigade and No. 5 Commando, followed by two brigades of the 5th Infantry Division and Royal Marines. Fairey Albacore and Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers attacked Arrachart Airport and Vichy shipping, supported by SAAF planes and Grumman Martlets from the Fleet Air Arm. The Swordfish sank the armed merchant cruiser &quot;Bougainville&quot; and the submarine &quot;Bévéziers&quot;.

Vichy governor Armand Annet led about 8,000 troops: about 6,000 Malagasy &quot;tirailleurs&quot;, and most of the others, Senegalese. He had 1,500–3,000 Vichy troops around Diego-Suarez, but naval and air defences were relatively light or obsolete: eight coastal batteries, two armed merchant cruisers, two sloops, five submarines, 17 Morane-Saulnier 406 fighters, and 10 Potez 63 bombers. He surrendered in November 1942.

====Battle for La Réunion (22 November 1942)====

Réunion was under the authority of the Vichy regime until 30 November 1942, when the island was liberated by the destroyer &quot;Léopard&quot; of the Free French Naval Forces.

&quot;Léopard&quot; sailed with 74 men from Mauritius on 26 November, and arrived at Saint-Denis on the 27th. The invaders took control, first of the government palace, then by evening the rest of Saint-Denis. They made contact with friendly elements, notably Communist leader Léon de Lépervanche. De Gaulle&#x27;s governor, , arrived and broadcast a call for calm. The next day Communist cells seized the city hall, arrested the mayor, and elected Lépervanche leader of a &quot;Committee of Public Safety&quot;. Next they tried and failed to capture the 95 mm battery at La Port, commanded by Pétainist Lieutenant Émile Hugot, who retaliated by opening fire on &quot;Léopard&quot;. She retreated out to sea and fired back, killing two. Small arms fire from the Free French thwarted a sortie by the Vichyists and badly wounded Hugot. Fearing an attack by regular troops, the gunners retreated, the battery fell silent, and &quot;Léopard&quot; approached Le Port. Governor had received no response from Vichy to repeated requests for instructions, and decided not to put up even a symbolic defense after he learned that the invaders were French and not British. But the captain of the &quot;Léopard&quot;, increasingly nervous about enemy submarines and his ship&#x27;s safety, threatened to destroy the island&#x27;s factories. After lengthy negotiations with Capagorry, Aubert eventually agreed to surrender on condition that the French again threaten the factories, and so allow him to save face. The surrender was formalised on the 30th.

===South-East Asian===

==== Vietnam–Laos–Cambodia campaign ====

=====Japan invades French Indochina (September 1940)=====

Japan seized overall control of Indochina but the Vichy government ran local affairs until 1944.

=====Limited Allied support to French Indochina (1943–1945)=====
The French Far East Expeditionary Corps () (CEFEO) was created on paper by General de Gaulle in October 1943. However, building a full-scale expeditionary force dedicated to liberating outnumbered French Indochina from Japanese forces was delayed, as the European theatre of operations and the liberation of metropolitan France became top priorities for the deployment of France&#x27;s limited forces.

The United States Chief of Staff also formally restricted the Allied support to French Indochina. Fourteenth Air Force Commander Claire Lee Chennault, a French American, wrote in his memoirs: &quot;I carried out my orders to the letter but I did not relish the idea of leaving Frenchmen to be slaughtered in the jungle while I was forced officially to ignore their plight.&quot;

In contrast, the British, who trained the first CLI/Gaurs (small, specialized units), supported French Indochina through their Force 136, flew aerial supply missions for the airborne commandos, and delivered Tommy guns, mortars, and grenades from their Calcutta base.

=====SOE&#x27;s French Indochina Section (1943–1945)=====
The &quot;Forces Expéditionnaires Françaises d&#x27;Extrême-Orient&quot; (FEFEO) &quot;Corps Léger d&#x27;Intervention&quot; (CLIs, or &quot;Gaurs&quot;) were airdropped by the British Force 136 and fought Japanese troops occupying the French colonies of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Gaurs were guerrillas who recruited and trained Mèo and Thai local commandos. Following World War II, the GCMA French airborne commandos, serving in the Indochina War, were created on the model of the gaurs (CLI) who were themselves modelled on the British Chindit special forces.

The Gaur &quot;Polaire&quot; (&quot;polar&quot;), codename for Captain Ayrolles&#x27; commando unit, airdropped into the Traninh to prepare for the arrival of the CLI, but were taken by surprise by the Japanese &quot;coup de force&quot; of 9 March 1945, and Captain Ayrolles changed the objective to sabotage. The Gaur &quot;Polaire&quot; blew eight bridges on the RC 7 (), attacked Japanese detachments and convoys, blew up airstrip warehouses and storage buildings at the Khan Kai camp, and also destroyed a fuel and vehicle depot. A Japanese battalion pursued them, without success. This operation delayed the arrival of the Japanese in Luang Prabang for around three weeks.

On 17 March 1945, Captain Cortadellas&#x27;s Gaur K parachuted into Điện Biên Phủ (the city of the later famous siege in the Indochina War, 1946–1954). At French Commander Marcel Alessandri&#x27;s request, Gaur K, supported by 80 remaining legionnaires from the 3/5th REI (), was sent to the of the Alessandri column retreating to China via high-altitude overland tracks. Battles ensued on 11 April at Houei Houn, 15 April at Muong Koua, 21 April at Boun Tay, and 22 April at Muong Yo.

On 9 October 1945, Gaur Détachement C infiltrated Cambodia, restored the French colonial administration, and staged a discreet coup d&#x27;état to restore the King of Cambodia&#x27;s rule.

Forty former French Jedburgh volunteers also secretly fought the Japanese in French Indochina. These forces embarked at Glasgow with layovers at Port Said, Bombay, and Colombo, and gathered in a camp at Ceylon in November 1944. Notable Force 136 members dropped into Laos during 1945 include French Colonels (22 January), (28 February), and Jean Sassi (4 June).

Local resistance was headed by General Eugène Mordant.

<doc id="376967" wikidata="Q138937" url="?curid=376967" title="Rosin">
<text>Rosin (), also known as colophony or Greek pitch (), is a resinous material obtained from pine trees and other plants, mostly conifers. The primary components of rosin are diterpenoids, i.e., C20 carboxylic acids. Rosin consists mainly of resin acids, especially abietic acid. Rosin often appears as a semi-transparent, brittle substance that ranges in color from yellow to black and melts at stove-top temperatures. 

In addition to industrial applications such in as varnishes, adhesives, and sealing wax, rosin is used with string instruments on the bow hair to enhance its ability to grip and sound the strings, and it provides grip in various sports and activities. Rosin also serves as an ingredient in medicinal and pharmaceutical formulations and can cause contact dermatitis or occupational asthma in sensitive individuals. It is an FDA approved food additive.

The name &quot;colophony&quot; originates from , Latin for &quot;resin from Colophon&quot; (), an ancient Ionic city.

==Properties==
Rosin is brittle and friable, with a faint pine odor. It is typically a glassy solid, though some rosins will crystallize, especially when brought into solution. The practical melting point is variable, some being semi-fluid at the temperature of boiling water, others melting at . It is flammable, burning with a smoky flame. It is soluble in alcohol, ether, benzene and chloroform.

Rosin, consisting mainly of abietic acid, combines with caustic alkalis to form salts (rosinates or pinates) that are known as rosin soaps. They are used in soap making.

==Uses==

* It is rubbed on the hair of bows for bowed string instruments to increase friction.

* It has been used for centuries for caulking ships. 

* It is approved by the US FDA as a miscellaneous food additive. 

* It is an ingredient in printing inks, photocopying and laser printing paper, varnishes, adhesives (glues), soap, paper sizing, soda, soldering fluxes, and sealing wax. 

* It can be used as a glazing agent in medicines and chewing gum. It is denoted by E number E915. A related glycerol ester (E445) can be used as an emulsifier in soft drinks. In pharmaceuticals, rosin forms an ingredient in several plasters and ointments.

* In industry, rosin is a flux used in soldering. The lead-tin solder commonly used in electronics has 1 to 2% rosin by weight as a flux core, helping the molten metal flow and making a better connection by reducing the refractory solid oxide layer formed at the surface back to metal. It is frequently seen as a burnt or clear residue around new soldering.

* Rosin is also sometimes used as internal reinforcement for very thin skinned metal objects - like silver, copper or tin plate candlesticks, or sculptures, where it is simply melted, poured into a hollow thin-skinned object, and left to harden.

* A mixture of pitch and rosin is used to make a surface against which glass is polished when making optical components such as lenses.

* Rosin is added in small quantities to traditional linseed oil/sand gap fillers (&quot;mastic&quot;), used in building work.

* When mixed with waxes and oils, rosin is the main ingredient of &quot;mystic smoke&quot;, a gum which, when rubbed and suddenly stretched, appears to produce puffs of smoke from the fingertips.

Rosin is extensively used for its friction-increasing capacity in several fields:
* Ballet, flamenco, and Irish dancers are known to rub the tips and heels of their shoes in powdered rosin to reduce slippage on clean wooden dance floors or competition/performance stages. It was at one time used in the same way in fencing and is still used as such by boxers.
* Gymnasts and team handball players use it to improve grip. Rock climbers have used it in some locations.
* Olympic weightlifters rub the soles of their weightlifting boots in rosin to improve traction on the platform.
* It is applied to the track surface at the starting line of drag racing courses to improve traction.
* Bull riders rub rosin on their rope and glove for additional grip.
* Baseball pitchers and ten-pin bowlers may use a small cloth bag of powdered rosin for better ball control. Baseball players sometimes combine rosin with sunscreen, creating a very sticky substance that allows far more grip on the ball than the rosin alone will; the use of such a substance is a violation of Major League Baseball rules.
* Rosin can be applied to the hands in aerial acrobatics such as aerial silks and pole dancing to increase grip.

Other uses that are not based on friction:
* Fine art uses rosin for tempera emulsions and as painting-medium component for oil paintings. It is soluble in oil of turpentine and turpentine substitute, and needs to be warmed.
* In a printmaking technique, aquatint rosin is used on the etching plate in order to create surfaces in gray tones.
* In archery, when a new bowstring is being made or waxed for maintenance purposes, rosin may be present in the wax mixture. This provides an amount of tackiness to the string to hold its constituent strands together and reduce wear and fraying.
* Dog groomers use powdered rosin to aid in removal of excess hair from deep in the ear canal by giving the groomer a better grip to grasp the hairs with. 
* Some brands of fly paper use a solution of rosin and rubber as the adhesive.
* Rosin is sometimes used as an ingredient in dubbing wax used in fly tying.
* Rosin is used hot to de-encapsulate epoxy integrated circuits.
* Rosin can be mixed with beeswax and a small amount of linseed oil to affix reeds to reed blocks in accordions.
* Rosin potatoes can be cooked by dropping potatoes into boiling rosin and cooking until they float to the surface.

Rosin and its derivatives also exhibit wide-ranging pharmaceutical applications. Rosin derivatives show excellent film forming and coating properties. They are also used for tablet film and enteric coating purpose. Rosins have also been used to formulate microcapsules and nanoparticles.

Glycerol, sorbitol, and mannitol esters of rosin are used as chewing gum bases for medicinal applications. The degradation and biocompatibility of rosin and rosin-based biomaterials has been examined in vitro and ex vivo.

===Rosin soaps and esters===
Treatment of rosin with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate converts the abietic acid into its sodium salt, which is known as a soap. Whereas most domestic soaps are sodium salts of straight-chain fatty acids, the rosin soaps have the branched and cyclic backbone associated with abietic acid. Rosin soaps, also called rosinates, are used to &quot;size&quot; paper, a process that gives paper a desirable hydrophobic texture.

The conversion of abietic acid to esters is also practiced commercially. Ester of glycerol and methanol are both of interest. These materials are colorless syrups. They are compounded with polymers as tackifiers.

===Violin rosin===

Players of bowed string instruments rub cakes or blocks of rosin on their bow hair so it can grip the strings and make them &quot;speak&quot;, or vibrate clearly. Occasionally, substances such as beeswax, gold, silver, tin, or meteoric iron are added to the rosin to modify its stiction/friction properties and the tone that can be produced. Powdered rosin can be applied to new hair, for example with a felt pad or cloth, to reduce the time taken in getting sufficient rosin onto the hair. Rosin is often reapplied immediately before playing the instrument. Lighter rosin is generally preferred for violins and violas, and in high-humidity climates, while darker rosins are preferred for cellos, and for players in cool, dry areas. There are also specific, distinguishing types for basses.
* Violin rosin can be applied to the bridges in other musical instruments, such as the banjo and banjolele, in order to prevent the bridge from moving during vigorous playing.

The type of rosin used with bowed string instruments is determined by the diameter of the strings. Generally this means that the larger the instrument is, the softer the rosin should be. For instance, double bass rosin is generally soft enough to be with slow movements. A cake of bass rosin left in a single position for several months will show evidence of flow, especially in warmer weather.

== Production ==
Three methods are used to collect rosin. Rosin exudates are collected from gashes in the bark of living pine trees. Alternatively (see below) rosin is extracted from stumps. Yet another source is pulp mills that use the Kraft process. Tall oil rosin is produced during the distillation of crude tall oil, a by-product of the kraft paper making process. The collection and processing of rosin is called Naval Stores.

The separation of the oleo-resin into the essential oil (spirit of turpentine) and common rosin is accomplished by distillation in large copper stills. The essential oil is carried off at a temperature of between ° and , leaving fluid rosin, which is run off through a tap at the bottom of the still, and purified by passing through straining wadding. Rosin varies in color, according to the age of the tree from which the turpentine is drawn and the degree of heat applied in distillation, from an opaque, almost pitch-black substance through grades of brown and yellow to an almost perfectly transparent colorless glassy mass. The commercial grades are numerous, ranging by letters from A (the darkest) to N (extra pale), superior to which are W (window glass) and WW (water-white) varieties, the latter having about three times the value of the common qualities.

When pine trees are harvested &quot;the resinous portions of fallen or felled trees like longleaf and slash pines, when allowed to remain upon the ground, resist decay indefinitely.&quot; This &quot;stump waste&quot;, through the use of destructive distillation or solvent processes, can be used to obtain rosin. This type of rosin is typically called wood rosin.

Because the turpentine and pine oil from destructive distillation &quot;become somewhat contaminated with other distillation products&quot;, solvent processes are commonly used. In this process, stumps and roots are chipped and soaked in the light end of the heavy naphtha fraction (boiling between ). Multi-stage counter-current extraction is commonly used. In this process, fresh naphtha first contacts wood leached in intermediate stages, and naphtha laden with rosin from intermediate stages contacts unleached wood before vacuum distillation to recover naphtha from the rosin, along with fatty acids, turpentine, and other constituents later separated through steam distillation. Leached wood is steamed for additional naphtha recovery prior to burning for energy recovery. After the solvent has been recovered, &quot;the terpene oils are separated by fractional distillation and recovered mainly as refined turpentine, dipentene, and pine oil. The nonvolatile residue from the extract is wood rosin of rather dark color. Upgrading of the rosin is carried out by clarification methods that generally may include bed-filtering or furfural-treatment of rosin-solvent solution.&quot;

On a large scale, rosin is treated by destructive distillation for the production of rosin spirit, pinoline and rosin oil. The last enters into the composition of some of the solid lubricating greases, and is also used as an adulterant of other oils.

===Locales===
The chief region of rosin production includes Indonesia, southern China (such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan and Jiangxi), and the northern part of Vietnam. Chinese rosin is obtained mainly from the turpentine of Masson&#x27;s pine &quot;Pinus massoniana&quot; and slash pine &quot;P. elliottii&quot;. The latter species is native to the southeastern U.S., but is now widely planted in tree plantations in China.

The South Atlantic and eastern Gulf states of the United States is a second chief region of production. American rosin is obtained from the turpentine of longleaf pine &quot;Pinus palustris&quot; and loblolly pine &quot;P. taeda&quot;. In Mexico, most of the rosin is derived from live tapping of several species of pine trees, but mostly &quot;Pinus oocarpa&quot;, &quot;Pinus leiophylla&quot;, &quot;Pinus devoniana&quot; and &quot;Pinus montezumae&quot;. Most production is concentrated in the west-central state of Michoacán.

The main source of supply in Europe is the French district of Landes, in the departments of Gironde and Landes, where the maritime pine &quot;P. pinaster&quot; is extensively cultivated. In the north of Europe, rosin is obtained from the Scots pine &quot;P. sylvestris&quot;, and throughout European countries local supplies are obtained from other species of pine, with Aleppo pine &quot;P. halepensis&quot; being particularly important in the Mediterranean region.

== Health effects ==
Prolonged exposure to rosin fumes released during soldering can cause occupational asthma (formerly called &quot;colophony disease&quot; in this context) in sensitive individuals, although it is not known which component of the fumes causes the problem. The symptoms also include desquamation of bronchial epithelium.

Prolonged exposure to rosin, by handling rosin-coated products, such as laser printer or photocopying paper, can give rise to a form of industrial contact dermatitis.

<text>The Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages (roughly, from the 10th century to the middle of the 15th century) was marked by the fragmentation of the Carolingian Empire and West Francia (843–987); the expansion of royal control by the House of Capet (987–1328), including their struggles with the virtually independent principalities (duchies and counties, such as the Norman and Angevin regions), and the creation and extension of administrative/state control (notably under Philip II Augustus and Louis IX) in the 13th century; and the rise of the House of Valois (1328–1589), including the protracted dynastic crisis against the House of Plantagenet and their Angevin Empire, culminating in the Hundred Years&#x27; War (1337–1453) (compounded by the catastrophic Black Death in 1348), which laid the seeds for a more centralized and expanded state in the early modern period and the creation of a sense of French identity.

Up to the 12th century, the period saw the elaboration and extension of the seigneurial economic system (including the attachment of peasants to the land through serfdom); the extension of the Feudal system of political rights and obligations between lords and vassals; the so-called &quot;feudal revolution&quot; of the 11th century during which ever smaller lords took control of local lands in many regions; and the appropriation by regional/local seigneurs of various administrative, fiscal and judicial rights for themselves. From the 13th century on, the state slowly regained control of a number of these lost powers. The crises of the 13th and 14th centuries led to the convening of an advisory assembly, the Estates General, and also to an effective end to serfdom. During the seventy-year reign of Louis XIV, absolutist policies from Paris tightly constrained the regional nobility, centralizing political power at Versailles.

From the 12th and 13th centuries on, France was at the center of a vibrant cultural production that extended across much of western Europe, including the transition from Romanesque architecture to Gothic architecture and Gothic art; the foundation of medieval universities (such as the universities of Paris (recognized in 1150), Montpellier (1220), Toulouse (1229), and Orleans (1235)) and the so-called &quot;Renaissance of the 12th century&quot;; a growing body of secular vernacular literature (including the , chivalric romance, troubadour and trouvère poetry, etc.) and medieval music (such as the flowering of the Notre Dame school of polyphony).

==Geography==
From the Middle Ages onward, French rulers believed their kingdoms had natural borders: the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Rhine. This was used as a pretext for an aggressive policy and repeated invasions. The belief, however, had mere basis in reality for not all of these territories were part of the Kingdom and the authority of the King within his kingdom would be quite fluctuant. The lands that composed the Kingdom of France showed great geographical diversity; the northern and central parts enjoyed a temperate climate while the southern part was closer to the Mediterranean climate. While there were great differences between the northern and southern parts of the kingdom there were equally important differences depending on the distance of mountains: mainly the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Massif Central. France had important rivers that were used as waterways: the Loire, the Rhône, the Seine as well as the Garonne. These rivers were settled earlier than the rest and important cities were founded on their banks but they were separated by large forests, marsh, and other rough terrains.

Before the Romans conquered Gaul, the Gauls lived in villages organised in wider tribes. The Romans referred to the smallest of these groups as &quot;pagi&quot; and the widest ones as &quot;civitates&quot;. These &quot;pagi&quot; and &quot;civitates&quot; were often taken as a basis for the imperial administration and would survive up to the middle-ages when their capitals became centres of bishoprics. These religious provinces would survive until the French revolution. During the Roman Empire, southern Gaul was more heavily populated and because of this more episcopal sees were present there at first while in northern France they shrank greatly in size because of the barbarian invasions and became heavily fortified to resist the invaders.

Discussion of the size of France in the Middle Ages is complicated by distinctions between lands personally held by the king (the &quot;domaine royal&quot;) and lands held in homage by another lord. The notion of &quot;res publica&quot; inherited from the Roman province of Gaul was not fully maintained by the Frankish kingdom and the Carolingian Empire, and by the early years of the Direct Capetians, the French kingdom was more or less a fiction. The &quot;domaine royal&quot; of the Capetians was limited to the regions around Paris, Bourges and Sens. The great majority of French territory was part of Aquitaine, the Duchy of Normandy, the Duchy of Brittany, the Comté of Champagne, the Duchy of Burgundy, the County of Flanders and other territories (for a map, see Provinces of France). In principle, the lords of these lands owed homage to the French king for their possession, but in reality the king in Paris had little control over these lands, and this was to be confounded by the uniting of Normandy, Aquitaine and England under the Plantagenet dynasty in the 12th century.

Philip II Augustus undertook a massive French expansion in the 13th century, but most of these acquisitions were lost both by the royal system of &quot;apanage&quot; (the giving of regions to members of the royal family to be administered) and through losses in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Only in the 15th century would Charles VII and Louis XI gain control of most of modern-day France (except for Brittany, Navarre, and parts of eastern and northern France).

The weather in France and Europe in the Middle Ages was significantly milder than during the periods preceding or following it. Historians refer to this as the &quot;Medieval Warm Period&quot;, lasting from about the 10th century to about the 14th century. Part of the French population growth in this period (see below) is directly linked to this temperate weather and its effect on crops and livestock.

==Demography==

At the end of the Middle Ages, France was the most populous region in Europe—having overtaken Spain and Italy by 1340. In the 14th century, before the arrival of the Black Death, the total population of the area covered by modern-day France has been estimated at 16 million. The population of Paris is controversial. Josiah Russell argued for about 80,000 in the early 14th century, although he noted that some other scholars suggested 200,000. The higher count would make it by far the largest city in western Europe; the lower count would put it behind Venice with 100,000 and Florence with 96,000. The Black Death killed an estimated one-third of the population from its appearance in 1348. The concurrent Hundred Years&#x27; War slowed recovery. It would be the mid-16th century before the population recovered to mid-fourteenth century levels.

In the early Middle Ages, France was a center of Jewish learning, but increasing persecution, and a series of expulsions in the 14th century, caused considerable suffering for French Jews; &quot;see History of the Jews in France&quot;.

==Languages and literacy==

During the Middle Ages in France, Medieval Latin was the primary medium of scholarly exchange as well as the liturgical language of the Catholic Church; it was also the language of science, literature, law, and administration. From 1200 on, vernacular languages began to be used in administrative work and the law courts, but Latin would remain an administrative and legal language until the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts (1539) prescribed the use of French in all judicial acts, notarized contracts, and official legislation.

The vast majority of the population, however, spoke a variety of vernacular languages derived from vulgar Latin, the common spoken language of the Western Roman Empire. The medieval Italian poet Dante, in his Latin &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot;, classified the Romance languages into three groups by their respective words for &quot;yes&quot;: &quot;Nam alii oc, alii si, alii vero dicunt oil&quot; (&quot;For some say &quot;oc&quot;, others say &quot;si&quot;, others say &quot;oïl&quot;&quot;). The &quot;oïl&quot; languagesfrom Latin &quot; &quot;, &quot;that is it&quot;were spoken primarily in northern France, the &quot;oc&quot; languagesfrom Latin &#x27;, &quot;that&quot;in southern France, and the &quot;si&quot; languagesfrom Latin &#x27;, &quot;thus&quot;on the Italian and Iberian peninsulas. Modern linguists typically add a third group within France around Lyon, the &quot;Arpitan&quot; or &quot;Franco-Provençal language&quot;, whose modern word for &quot;yes&quot; is &quot;ouè&quot;.
The Gallo-Romance group in the north of France, consisting of &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; such as Picard, Walloon, and Francien, were influenced by Germanic languages spoken by the earliest Frankish invaders. From the time of Clovis I on, the Franks expanded their rule over northern Gaul. Over time, the French language developed from either the Oïl languages found around Paris and Île-de-France (the Francien theory) or from a standard administrative language based on common characteristics found in all Oïl languages (the lingua franca theory).

The &quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot;, consisting of the languages which use &quot;oc&quot; or &quot;òc&quot; for &quot;yes&quot;, was the language group spoken in the south of France and northeastern Spain. These languages, such as Gascon and Provençal, have relatively little Frankish influence.

The Middle Ages also saw the influence of other linguistic groups on the dialects spoken in France. From the 4th to 7th centuries, Brythonic-speaking peoples from Cornwall, Devon, and Wales travelled across the English Channel, both for reasons of trade and of flight from the Anglo-Saxon invasions of England, and established themselves in Armorica in northwest France. Their dialect evolved into the Breton language in more recent centuries, and they gave their name to the peninsula they inhabited: Brittany.

Attested since the time of Julius Caesar, a non-Celtic people who spoke a Basque-related language inhabited the Novempopulania (&quot;Aquitania Tertia&quot;) in southwestern France, though the language gradually lost ground to the expanding Romance during a period spanning most of the Early Middle Ages. This Proto-Basque influenced the emerging Latin-based language spoken in the area between the Garonne and the Pyrenees, eventually resulting in the dialect of Occitan called Gascon.

Scandinavian Vikings invaded France from the 9th century onwards and established themselves mostly in what would come to be called Normandy. The Normans took up the langue d&#x27;oïl spoken there, although Norman French remained heavily influenced by Old Norse and its dialects. They also contributed many words to French related to sailing and farming. After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the Normans&#x27; language developed into Anglo-Norman. Anglo-Norman served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce in England from the time of the conquest until the Hundred Years&#x27; War, by which time the use of French-influenced English had spread throughout English society.

Also around this time period, many words from the Arabic language entered French, mainly indirectly through Medieval Latin, Italian and Spanish. There are words for luxury goods (&quot;élixir, orange&quot;), spices (&quot;camphre, safran&quot;), trade goods (&quot;alcool, bougie, coton&quot;), sciences (&quot;alchimie, hasard&quot;), and mathematics (&quot;algèbre, algorithme&quot;).

While education and literacy had been important components of aristocratic service in the Carolingian period, by the 11th century and continuing into the 13th century, the lay (secular) public in France—both nobles and peasants—was largely illiterate, except for (at least to the end of the 12th century) members of the great courts and, in the south, smaller noble families. This situation began to change in the 13th century, where we find highly literate members of the French nobility like Guillaume de Lorris, Geoffrey of Villehardouin (sometimes referred to as Villehardouin), and Jean de Joinville (sometimes referred to as Joinville). Similarly, due to the outpouring of French vernacular literature from the 12th century on (, chivalric romance, troubadour and trouvère poetry, etc.), French eventually became the &quot;international language of the aristocracy&quot;.

==Society and government==

===Peasants===
In the Middle Ages in France, the vast majority of the population—between 80 and 90 percent—were peasants.

Traditional categories inherited from the Roman and Merovingian period (distinctions between free and unfree peasants, between tenants and peasants who owned their own land, etc.) underwent significant changes up to the 11th century. The traditional rights of &quot;free&quot; peasants—such as service in royal armies (they had been able to serve in the royal armies as late as Charlemagne&#x27;s reign) and participation in public assemblies and law courts—were lost through the 9th to the 10th centuries, and they were increasingly made dependents of nobles, churches and large landholders. The mid-8th century to 1000 also saw a steady increase of aristocratic and monastic control of the land, at the expense of landowning peasants. At the same time, the traditional notion of &quot;unfree&quot; dependents and the distinction between &quot;unfree&quot; and &quot;free&quot; tenants was eroded as the concept of serfdom (see also History of serfdom) came to dominate.

From the mid-8th century on, particularly in the north, the relationship between peasants and the land became increasingly characterized by the extension of the new &quot;bipartite estate&quot; system (manorialism), in which peasants (who were bound to the land) held tenant holdings from a lord or monastery (for which they paid rent), but were also required to work the lord&#x27;s own &quot;demesne&quot;; in the north, some of these estates could be quite substantial. This system remained a standard part of lord-tenant relations into the 12th century.

The economic and demographic crises of the 14th–15th centuries (agricultural expansion had lost many of the gains made in the 12th and 13th centuries) reversed this trend: landlords offered serfs their freedom in exchange for working abandoned lands, ecclesiastical and royal authorities created new &quot;free&quot; cities (&quot;villefranches&quot;) or granted freedom to existing cities, etc. By the end of the 15th century, serfdom was largely extinct; henceforth &quot;free&quot; peasants paid rents for their own lands, and the lord&#x27;s demesne was worked by hired labor. This liberated the peasantry to a certain degree, but also made their lives more precarious in times of economic uncertainty. For lords who rented out more and more of their holdings for fixed rents, the initial benefits were positive, but over time they found themselves increasingly cash-strapped as inflationary pressures reduced their incomes.

===Cities and towns===
Much of the Gallo-Roman urban network of cities survived (albeit much changed) into the Middle Ages as regional centers and capitals: certain cities had been chosen as centers of bishoprics by the church (for example, Paris, Reims, Aix, Tours, Carcassonne and Narbonne, Auch, Albi, Bourges, Lyon, etc.), others as seats of local (county, duchy) administrative power (such as Angers, Blois, Poitiers, Toulouse). In many cases (such as with Poitiers) cities were seats of both episcopal and administrative power.

From the 10th to the 11th centuries, the urban development of the country expanded (particularly on the northern coasts): new ports appeared and dukes and counts encouraged and created new towns. In other areas, urban growth was slower and centered on the monastic houses. In many regions, market towns (&quot;burgs&quot;) with limited privileges were established by local lords. In the late 11th century, &quot;communes&quot;, governing assemblies, began to develop in towns. Starting sporadically in the late 10th, and increasingly in the 12th century, many towns and villages were able to gain economic, social or judicial privileges and franchises from their lords (exemptions from tolls and dues, rights to clear land or hold fairs, some judicial or administrative independence, etc.). The seigneurial reaction to expanding urbanism and enfranchisement was mixed; some lords fought against the changes, but some lords gained financial and political advantages from the communal movement and growing trade.

The 13th to 14th centuries were a period of significant urbanization. Paris was the largest city in the realm, and indeed one of the largest cities in Europe, with an estimated population of 200,000 or more at the end of the century. The second-largest city was Rouen; the other major cities (with populations over 10,000) were Orléans, Tours, Bordeaux, Lyon, Dijon, and Reims. In addition to these, there also existed zones with an extended urban network of medium to small cities, as in the south and the Mediterranean coast (from Toulouse to Marseille, including Narbonne and Montpellier) and in the north (Beauvais, Laon, Amiens, Arras, Bruges, etc.). Market towns increased in size and many were able to gain privileges and franchises including transformation into free cities (&quot;villes franches&quot;); rural populations from the countrysides moved to the cities and burgs. This was also a period of urban building: the extension of walls around the entirety of the urban space, the vast construction of Gothic cathedrals (starting in the 12th century), urban fortresses, castles (such as Philip II Augustus&#x27; Louvre around 1200) and bridges.

===Aristocracy, nobles, knights===
In the Carolingian period, the &quot;aristocracy&quot; (&quot;nobilis&quot; in the Latin documents) was by no means a legally defined category. With traditions going back to the Romans; one was &quot;noble&quot; if he or she possessed significant land holdings, had access to the king and royal court, could receive &quot;honores&quot; and benefices for service (such as being named count or duke). Their access to political power in the Carolingian period might also necessitate a need for education. Their wealth and power was also evident in their lifestyle and purchase of luxury goods, and in their maintenance of an armed entourage of &quot;fideles&quot; (men who had sworn oaths to serve them).

From the late 9th to the late 10th century, the nature of the noble class changed significantly. First off, the aristocracy increasingly focused on establishing strong regional bases of landholdings, on taking hereditary control of the counties and duchies, and eventually on erecting these into veritable independent principalities and privatizing various privileges and rights of the state. (By 1025, the area north of the Loire was dominated by six or seven of these virtually independent states.) After 1000, these counties in turn began to break down into smaller lordships, as smaller lords wrest control of local lands in the so-called &quot;feudal revolution&quot; and seized control over many elements of comital powers (see vassal/feudal below).

Secondly, from the 9th century on, military ability was increasingly seen as conferring special status, and professional soldiers or &quot;milites&quot;, generally in the entourage of sworn lords, began to establish themselves in the ranks of the aristocracy (acquiring local lands, building private castles, seizing elements of justice), thereby transforming into the military noble class historians refer to as &quot;knights&quot;.

====Vassalage and feudal land====

The Merovingians and Carolingians maintained relations of power with their aristocracy through the use of clientele systems and the granting of &quot;honores&quot; and benefices, including land, a practice which grew out of Late Antiquity. This practice would develop into the system of vassalage and feudalism in the Middle Ages. Originally, vassalage did not imply the giving or receiving of landholdings (which were granted only as a reward for loyalty), but by the eighth century the giving of a landholding was becoming standard. The granting of a landholding to a vassal did not relinquish the lord&#x27;s property rights, but only the use of the lands and their income; the granting lord retained ultimate ownership of the fee and could, technically, recover the lands in case of disloyalty or death.

In the 8th-century Frankish empire, Charles Martel was the first to make large scale and systematic use (the practice had remained until then sporadic) of the remuneration of vassals by the concession of the usufruct of lands (a &quot;beneficatium&quot; or &quot;benefice&quot; in the documents) for the lifetime of the vassal, or, sometimes extending to the second or third generation. By the middle of the 10th century, feudal land grants (fee, fiefs) had largely become hereditary. The eldest son of a deceased vassal would inherit, but first he had to do homage and fealty to the lord and pay a &quot;relief&quot; for the land (a monetary recognition of the lord&#x27;s continuing proprietary rights over the property). By the 11th century, the bonds of vassalage and the granting of fiefs had spread throughout much of French society, but it was in no ways universal in France: in the south, feudal grants of land or of rights were unknown.

In its origin, the feudal grant had been seen in terms of a personal bond between lord and vassal, but with time and the transformation of fiefs into hereditary holdings, the nature of the system came to be seen as a form of &quot;politics of land&quot; (an expression used by the historian Marc Bloch). The 11th century in France saw what has been called by historians a &quot;feudal revolution&quot; or &quot;mutation&quot; and a &quot;fragmentation of powers&quot; (Bloch) that was unlike the development of feudalism in England or Italy or Germany in the same period or later: counties and duchies began to break down into smaller holdings as castellans and lesser seigneurs took control of local lands, and (as comital families had done before them) lesser lords usurped/privatized a wide range of prerogatives and rights of the state, most importantly the highly profitable rights of justice, but also travel dues, market dues, fees for using woodlands, obligations to use the lord&#x27;s mill, etc. (what Georges Duby called collectively the &quot;seigneurie banale&quot;). Power in this period became more personal and it would take centuries for the state to fully reimpose its control over local justice and fiscal administration (by the 15th century, much of the seigneur&#x27;s legal purview had been given to the &quot;bailliages&quot;, leaving them only affairs concerning seigneurial dues and duties, and small affairs of local justice)

This &quot;fragmentation of powers&quot; was not however systematic throughout France, and in certain counties (such as Flanders, Normandy, Anjou, Toulouse), counts were able to maintain control of their lands into the 12th century or later. Thus, in some regions (like Normandy and Flanders), the vassal/feudal system was an effective tool for ducal and comital control, linking vassals to their lords; but in other regions, the system led to significant confusion, all the more so as vassals could and frequently did pledge themselves to two or more lords. In response to this, the idea of a &quot;liege lord&quot; was developed (where the obligations to one lord are regarded as superior) in the 12th century.

====Peerage====

Medieval French kings conferred the dignity of peerage upon certain of his preëminent vassals, both clerical and lay. Some historians consider Louis VII (1137–1180) to have created the French system of peers.

Peerage was attached to a specific territorial jurisdiction, either an episcopal see for episcopal peerages or a fief for secular. Peerages attached to fiefs were transmissible or inheritable with the fief, and these fiefs are often designated as &quot;pairie-duché&quot; (for duchies) and &quot;pairie-comté&quot; (for counties).

By 1216 there were nine peers:
* Archbishop of Reims who had the distinction of anointing and crowning the king
* Bishop of Langres
* Bishop of Beauvais
* Bishop of Châlons
* Bishop of Noyon
* Duke of Normandy
* Duke of Burgundy
* Duke of Aquitaine also called Duke of Guyenne
* Count of Champagne

A few years later and before 1228 three peers were added to make the total of twelve peers:
* Bishop of Laon
* Count of Flanders
* Count of Toulouse

These twelve peerages are known as the &quot;ancient peerage&quot; or &quot;pairie ancienne&quot;, and the number twelve is sometimes said to have been chosen to mirror the 12 paladins of Charlemagne in the &quot;Chanson de geste&quot; (see below). Parallels may also be seen with mythical Knights of the Round Table under King Arthur. So popular was this notion, that for a long time people thought peerage had originated in the reign of Charlemagne, who was considered the model king and shining example for knighthood and nobility.

The dozen &quot;pairs&quot; played a role in the royal &quot;sacre&quot; or consecration, during the liturgy of the coronation of the king, attested to as early as 1179, symbolically upholding his crown, and each original peer had a specific role, often with an attribute. Since the peers were never twelve during the coronation in early periods, due to the fact that most lay peerages were forfeited to or merged in the crown, delegates were chosen by the king, mainly from the princes of the blood. In later periods peers also held up by poles a baldaquin or cloth of honour over the king during much of the ceremony.

In 1204 the Duchy of Normandy was absorbed by the French crown, and later in the 13th century two more of the lay peerages were absorbed by the crown (Toulouse 1271, Champagne 1284), so in 1297 three new peerages were created, the County of Artois, the Duchy of Anjou and the Duchy of Brittany, to compensate for the three peerages that had disappeared.

Thus, beginning in 1297 the practice started of creating new peerages by letters patent, specifying the fief to which the peerage was attached, and the conditions under which the fief could be transmitted (e.g. only male heirs) for princes of the blood who held an apanage. By 1328 all apanagists would be peers.

The number of lay peerages increased over time from 7 in 1297 to 26 in 1400, 21 in 1505, and 24 in 1588.

===Monarchy and regional powers===
France was a very decentralised state during the Middle Ages. At the time, Lorraine and Provence were states of the Holy Roman Empire and not a part of France. North of the Loire, the King of France at times fought or allied with one of the great principalities of Normandy, Anjou, Blois-Champagne, Flanders and Burgundy. The duke of Normandy was overlord of the duke of Brittany. South of the Loire were the principalities of Aquitaine, Toulouse and Barcelona. Normandy became the strongest power in the north, while Barcelona became the strongest in the south. The rulers of both fiefs eventually became kings, the former by the conquest of England, and the latter by the succession to Aragon. French suzerainty over Barcelona was only formally relinquished by Saint Louis in 1258.

Initially, West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates, but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father&#x27;s lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture, later popularized as the Salic law. The authority of the king was more religious than administrative. The 11th century in France marked the apogee of princely power at the expense of the king when states like Normandy, Flanders or Languedoc enjoyed a local authority comparable to kingdoms in all but name. The Capetians, as they were descended from the Robertians, were formerly powerful princes themselves who had successfully unseated the weak and unfortunate Carolingian kings.

The Carolingian kings had nothing more than a royal title when the Capetian kings added their principality to that title. The Capetians, in a way, held a dual status of King and Prince; as king they held the Crown of Charlemagne and as Count of Paris they held their personal fiefdom, best known as Île-de-France.

The fact that the Capetians both held lands as Prince as well as in the title of King gave them a complicated status. Thus they were involved in the struggle for power within France as princes but they also had a religious authority over Roman Catholicism in France as King. However, and despite the fact that the Capetian kings often treated other princes more as enemies and allies than as subordinates, their royal title was often recognised yet not often respected. The royal authority was so weak in some remote places that bandits were the effective power.

Some of the king&#x27;s vassals would grow sufficiently powerful that they would become some of the strongest rulers of western Europe. The Normans, the Plantagenets, the Lusignans, the Hautevilles, the Ramnulfids, and the House of Toulouse successfully carved lands outside France for themselves. The most important of these conquests for French history was the Norman Conquest by William the Conqueror, following the Battle of Hastings and immortalised in the Bayeux Tapestry, because it linked England to France through Normandy. Although the Normans were now both vassals of the French kings and their equals as kings of England, their zone of political activity remained centered in France.

An important part of the French aristocracy also involved itself in the crusades, and French knights founded and ruled the Crusader states. An example of the legacy left in the Middle East by these nobles is the Krak des Chevaliers&#x27; enlargement by the Counts of Tripoli and Toulouse.

The history of the monarchy is how it overcame the powerful barons over ensuing centuries, and established absolute sovereignty over France in the 16th century. A number of factors contributed to the rise of the French monarchy. The dynasty established by Hugh Capet continued uninterrupted until 1328, and the laws of primogeniture ensured orderly successions of power. Secondly, the successors of Capet came to be recognised as members of an illustrious and ancient royal house and therefore socially superior to their politically and economically superior rivals. Thirdly, the Capetians had the support of the Church, which favoured a strong central government in France. This alliance with the Church was one of the great enduring legacies of the Capetians. The First Crusade was composed almost entirely of Frankish Princes. As time went on the power of the King was expanded by conquests, seizures and successful feudal political battles.

====French power in the Middle Ages====
Vassals and cadets of the King of France made several foreign acquisitions during the Middle Ages:
*William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy (1066): conquered the Kingdom of England
*The success of the First Crusade led to the creation of a Frankish kingdom in the Levant in 1099
*Norman knights settled in Sicily, which was raised to a kingdom in 1130
*Fulk V, Count of Anjou (1131): became King of Jerusalem by marriage
*Afonso I of Portugal (1139): great-grandson of Robert I, Duke of Burgundy, and founder of the Kingdom of Portugal
*Henry II of England (1154): ruled England and much of Western France (The Angevin Empire)
*Alfonso II of Aragon, Count of Barcelona (1164): first Count of Barcelona to become King of Aragon in his own right
*Theobald I of Navarre, Count of Champagne (1234): inherited the Kingdom of Navarre from his uncle
*Charles I of Naples, Count of Anjou (1266): youngest son of Louis VIII of France, conquered the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily, proclaimed himself King of Albania
*Charles I of Hungary (1301): scion of the Capetian House of Anjou, King of Hungary and Croatia
*Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor: became a vassal of Philip IV of France while Count of Luxembourg. Philip IV advanced the candidacy of his brother Charles of Valois for the imperial throne, but the German electors were unwilling to expand French influence even further. Henry was elected King of Germany in 1308 as a compromise candidate, and became emperor in 1312.
*John of Bohemia (1310): son of Emperor Henry VII, he became of King of Bohemia by marriage. John was raised in Paris, and died fighting for the French in the Battle of Crécy
*Philip III of Navarre, Count of Évreux (1328): became King of Navarre by marriage
*Louis I of Hungary (1342): son of Charles I of Hungary, eventually became King of Poland in addition to the realms inherited from his father
*Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor (1346): son of John of Bohemia, he received French education and resided in the French court for seven years. His close connection to the House of France facilitated the sale of Dauphiné, an imperial fief, in 1349, and its eventual transfer into the French crown.
*Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy (1363): with his appanage of Burgundy and his marriage to the heiress of Flanders, he founded the House of Valois-Burgundy, the most powerful dynasty of the Middle Ages which is not of royal rank

The power of the French monarchy grew at a slower rate at the beginning:
*The early Capetians ruled much longer than their contemporaries, but had little power. They did not have the will, or the resources, to coerce their vassals into obedience.
*Louis VI began an aggressive policy of demanding obedience from his vassals in the Ile-de-France backed by military force
*Louis VII&#x27;s marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine brought the French monarchy&#x27;s influence to southern France, but the annulment of their marriage brought about the rise of the Angevin dynasty, the most formidable rival of the French monarchy
*Philip II made the French king the foremost power within his own kingdom, destroying Angevin power in France through the conquest of Normandy and Anjou
*Louis VIII embarked on the Albigensian Crusade, which brought northern France to war against the south
*Louis IX brought the prestige of the French monarchy at its height. Even the Mongol leader Hulagu, who had been under the impression that the Pope was the ruler of all Christians, realized that the true power rested in the King of France and sought an alliance with him. His crusading ventures, however, were unsuccessful
*Philip III inherited Toulouse and married his son to the heiress of Navarre and Champagne
*Philip IV was the most absolutist of the medieval French kings, but his costly policies brought him into conflict with the pope and the persecution of the Templars in order to obtain their resources.
*The orderly succession of French kings for more than 300 years, combined with an abrupt dynastic crisis in 1316 led to the adoption of a succession law that prevented the kingship from going out of the Capetian dynasty. The successive deaths of the sons of Philip IV in a short period of time led to the rise of the House of Valois
*Philip VI was an initially promising ruler, having brought Flanders into submission early in his reign. At the outbreak of the Hundred Years&#x27; War France was the foremost power in Western Europe, but this did not prevent his overwhelming defeat at Crécy.
*John II brought the French monarchy at its lowest with another overwhelming defeat in Poitiers.
*Charles V recovered most of the territories lost during the war
*The madness of Charles VI multiplied the woes of France, as the princes of the royal house split into factions in order to obtain power. France suffered another defeat at Agincourt, and the king was forced to disinherit his own son in favor of Henry V of England
*Charles VII was apathetic during the early years of his reign, but his fortunes changed with the rise of Joan of Arc in 1429 and his reconciliation with the Duke of Burgundy in 1435. The French were victorious at the end of the war in 1453, and the King of France was once again the most powerful monarch in Europe, with the first standing army since Roman times.

===Royal administration===

====King&#x27;s Council====
The kings of France traditionally always sought the advice of their entourage (vassals, clerics, etc.) before making important decisions. In the early Middle Ages, the entourage around the king was sometimes called the &quot;familia&quot;; later the expression &quot;hôtel du roi&quot; or the &quot;maison du roi&quot; (the &quot;royal household&quot;) was used for people attached directly to the person of the king, while (in the 12th century), those who were called upon to counsel the king in his administration of the realm took the form of a specific (and separate) institution called the King&#x27;s Court (Latin: the &quot;Curia Regis&quot;, later the &quot;Conseil du Roi&quot;)), although by the middle of the 13th century distinctions between &quot;hôtel du roi&quot; and &quot;curia regis&quot; were less clear.

In addition to the King&#x27;s Council, the consultative governing of the country also depended on other intermittent and permanent institutions, such as the States General, the Parlements and the Provincial Estates. The Parliament of Paris – as indeed all of the sovereign courts of the realm – was itself born out of the King&#x27;s Council: originally a consultative body of the &quot;Curia Regis&quot;, later (in the thirteenth century) endowed with judicial functions, the Parliament was separated from the King&#x27;s Council in 1254.

The King&#x27;s Court functioned as an advisory body under the early Capetian kings. It was composed of a number of the king&#x27;s trusted advisers but only a few traveled with the king at any time. By the later twelfth century it had become a judicial body with a few branching off to remain the king&#x27;s council. By the fourteenth century the term &quot;curia regis&quot; was no longer used. However, it had served as a predecessor to later sovereign assemblies; the Parlement which was a judiciary body, the Chamber of Accounts which was a financial body and King&#x27;s Council.

The composition of the King&#x27;s Council changed constantly over the centuries and according to the needs and desires of the king. Medieval councils frequently excluded:
*the queen (both as queen consort or as queen mother) – the influence of the queen lost direct political control as early as the 13th century, except in periods of regency; the queen thus only exceptionally attended the Council.
*close relations to the king, including younger sons, grandsons and princes of the royal bloodline (&quot;prince du sang&quot;) from junior branches of the family – these individuals were often suspected of political ambition and of plotting.

On the other hand, medieval councils generally included:
* the crown prince (the &quot;dauphin&quot;) – if he was of age to attend the council
* the &quot;grands&quot; – the most powerful members of the church and of the nobility.

The feudal aristocracy would maintain great control over the king&#x27;s council up until the 14th and 15th centuries. The most important positions in the court were those of the Great Officers of the Crown of France, headed by the connétable (chief military officer of the realm; established by King Philip I in 1060) and the chancellor. Other positions included the Grand Chambrier who managed the Royal Treasury along with the Grand Bouteiller (Grand Butler), before being supplanted of these functions by the Chamber of Accounts (Chambre des comptes, created by King Philip IV) and the position of Surintendant des finances (created in 1311). Certain kings were unable to reduce the importance of the feudal aristocracy (Louis X, Philip VI, John II, Charles VI), while others were more successful (Charles V, Louis XI).

Over the centuries, the number of jurists (or &quot;légistes&quot;), generally educated by the université de Paris, steadily increased as the technical aspects of the matters studied in the council mandated specialized counsellers. Coming from the lesser nobility or the bourgeoisie, these jurists (whose positions sometimes gave them or their heirs nobility, as the so-called &quot;noblesse de robe&quot; or chancellor nobles) helped in preparing and putting into legal form the king&#x27;s decisions, and they formed the early elements of a true civil service and royal administration which would – because of their permanence – provide a sense of stability and continuity to the royal council, despite its many reorganizations. In their attempts at greater efficiency, the kings tried to reduce the number of counsellors or to convoke &quot;reduced councils&quot;. Charles V had a council of 12 members.

The Council had only a consultational role: the final decision was always the king&#x27;s. Although jurists frequented praised (especially later in the 16th century) the advantages of consultative government (with the agreement of his counsellors, the king could more easily impose the most severe of his decisions, or he could have his most unpopular decisions blamed on his counsellors), mainstream legal opinion never held that the king was bound by the decisions of his council; the opposite was however put forward by the States General of 1355–1358.

The Council&#x27;s purview concerned all matters pertaining to government and royal administration, both in times of war and of peace. In his council, the king received ambassadors, signed treaties, appointed administrators and gave them instructions (called, from the 12th century on, &quot;mandements&quot;), elaborated on the laws of the realm (called &quot;ordonnances&quot;). The council also served as a supreme court and rendered royal justice on those matters that the king reserved for himself (so-called &quot;justice retenue&quot;) or decided to discuss personally.

Council meetings, initially irregular, took on a regular schedule which became daily from the middle of the 15th century.

====Royal finances====
The king was expected to survive on the revenues of the &quot;domaine royal&quot;, or lands that belonged to him directly. In times of need, the &quot;taille&quot;, an &quot;exceptional&quot; tax could be imposed and collected; this resource was increasingly required during the protracted wars of the 14th–15th centuries and the taille became permanent in 1439, when the right to collect taxes in support of a standing army was granted to Charles VII of France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

To oversee the Kingdom&#x27;s revenues and expenditure, the French King first relied solely on the &quot;Curia Regis&quot;. However, by the mid-12th century, the Crown entrusted its finances to the Knights Templar, who maintained a banking establishment in Paris. The royal Treasury was henceforth organized like a bank and salaries and revenues were transferred between accounts. Royal accounting officers in the field, who sent revenues to the Temple, were audited by the King&#x27;s Court, which had special clerks assigned to work at the Temple. These financial specialists came to be called the &quot;Curia in Compotis&quot; and sat in special sessions of the King&#x27;s Court for dealing with financial business. From 1297, accounts were audited twice yearly after Midsummer Day (24 June) and Christmas. In time, what was once a simple Exchequer of Receipts developed into a central auditing agency, branched off, and eventually specialized into a full-time court.

In 1256, Saint Louis issued a decree ordering all mayors, burghesses, and town councilmen to appear before the King&#x27;s sovereign auditors of the Exchequer (French &quot;gens des comptes&quot;) in Paris to render their final accounts. The King&#x27;s Court&#x27;s general secretariat had members who specialized in finance and accountancy and could receive accounts. A number of &quot;maîtres lais&quot; were commissioned to sit as the King&#x27;s Exchequer (&quot;comptes du Roi&quot;).

In or around 1303, the Paris Court of Accounts was established in the Palais de la Cité. Its auditors were responsible for overseeing revenue from Crown estates and checking public spending. It audited the royal household, inspectors, royal commissioners, provosts, baillifs, and seneschals. In 1307, the Philip IV definitively removed royal funds from the Temple and placed them in the fortress of the Louvre. Thereafter, the financial specialists received accounts for audit in a room of the royal palace that became known as the &quot;Camera compotorum&quot; or &quot;Chambre des comptes&quot;, and they began to be collectively identified under the same name, although still only a subcommission of the King&#x27;s Court, consisting of about sixteen people.

The Vivier-en-Brie Ordinance of 1320, issued by Philip V, required the &quot;Chambre&quot; to audit accounts, judge cases arising from accountability, and maintain registers of financial documents; it also laid out the basic composition of financial courts: three (later four) cleric masters of accounts (&quot;maîtres-clercs&quot;) to act as chief auditors and three &quot;maîtres-lais familiers du Roi&quot; empowered to hear and adjudge (&quot;oyer and terminer&quot;) audit accounts. They were assisted by eleven clerks (&quot;petis clercs&quot;, later &quot;clercs des comptes&quot;) who acted as auditors of the prests. This complement grew by 50 percent in the next two decades but was reduced to seven masters and twelve clerks in 1346. The office of &quot;président&quot; was created by the Ordinance of 1381, and a second lay Chief Baron was appointed in 1400. Clerks of court were eventually added to the court&#x27;s composition. Examiners (&quot;correcteurs&quot;) were created to assist the &quot;maitres&quot;. Other court officers (&quot;conseillers&quot;) appointed by the King were created to act alongside the &quot;maîtres ordinaires&quot;. Lastly, the Ordinance of 26 February 1464 named the Court of Accounts as the &quot;sovereign, primary, supreme, and sole court of last resort in all things financial&quot;.

While gaining in stability in the later 14th century, the court lost its central role in royal finances. First, currency was moved to a separate body (&quot;Chambre des monnaies&quot;), then the increasingly regular &quot;extraordinary&quot; taxes (&quot;aide&quot;, tallage, &quot;gabelle&quot;) became the responsibility of the &quot;généraux&quot; of the Cour des aides (created in 1390). The Crown&#x27;s domainal revenues, still retained by the Court of Accounts, fell in importance and value. By 1400, the Court&#x27;s role had been much reduced. However, with the gradual enlargement of the realm through conquest, the need for the court remained secure.

====Parlements====
The Parliament of Paris, born out of the king&#x27;s council in 1307, and sitting inside the medieval royal palace on the Île de la Cité, still the site of the Paris Hall of Justice. The jurisdiction of the Parliament of Paris covered the entire kingdom as it was in the fourteenth century, but did not automatically advance in step with the enlarging personal dominions of the kings. In 1443, following the turmoil of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, King Charles VII of France granted Languedoc its own &quot;parlement&quot; by establishing the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Toulouse, the first &quot;parlement&quot; outside of Paris; its jurisdiction extended over most of southern France.

Several other &quot;parlements&quot; were created in various provinces of France in the Middle Ages: Dauphiné (Grenoble 1453), Guyenne and Gascony (Bordeaux 1462), Burgundy (Dijon 1477), Normandy (Rouen 1499/1515). All of them were administrative capitals of regions with strong historical traditions of independence before they were incorporated into France.

====Estates General====

In 1302, expanding French royal power led to a general assembly consisting of the chief lords, both lay and ecclesiastical, and the representatives of the principal privileged towns, which were like distinct lordships. Certain precedents paved the way for this institution: representatives of principal towns had several times been convoked by the king, and under Philip III there had been assemblies of nobles and ecclesiastics in which the two orders deliberated separately. It was the dispute between Philip the Fair and Pope Boniface VIII which led to the States-General of 1302; the king of France desired that, in addition to the Great Officers of the Crown of France, he receive the counsel from the three estates in this serious crisis. The letters summoning the assembly of 1302 are published by M. Georges Picot in his collection of &quot;Documents inédits pour servir à l&#x27;histoire de France&quot;. During the same reign they were subsequently assembled several times to give him aid by granting subsidies. Over time subsidies came to be the most frequent motive for their convocation.

The Estates-General included representatives of the First Estate (clergy), Second Estate (the nobility), and Third Estate (commoners: all others), and monarchs always summoned them either to grant subsidies or to advise the Crown, to give aid and counsel. In their primitive form in the 14th and the first half of the 15th centuries, the Estates-General had only a limited elective element. The lay lords and the ecclesiastical lords (bishops and other high clergy) who made up the Estates-General were not elected by their peers, but directly chosen and summoned by the king. In the order of the clergy, however, since certain ecclesiastical bodies, e.g. abbeys and chapters of cathedrals, were also summoned to the assembly, and as these bodies, being persons in the moral but not in the physical sense, could not appear in person, their representative had to be chosen by the monks of the convent or the canons of the chapter. It was only the representation of the Third Estate which was furnished by election. Originally, moreover, the latter was not called upon as a whole to seek representation in the estates. It was only the &quot;bonnes villes&quot;, the privileged towns, which were called upon. They were represented by elected &quot;procureurs&quot;, who were frequently the municipal officials of the town, but deputies were often elected for the purpose. The country districts, the &quot;plat pays&quot;, were not represented. Even within the &quot;bonnes villes&quot;, the franchise was quite narrow.

====Prévôts, baillages====
The &quot;prévôts&quot; were the first-level judges created by the Capetian monarchy around the 11th century who administered the scattered parts of the royal domain. Provosts replaced viscounts wherever a viscounty had not been made a fief, and it is likely that the provost position imitated and was styled after the corresponding ecclesiastical provost of cathedral chapters. Provosts were entrusted with and carried out local royal power, including the collection of the Crown&#x27;s domainal revenues and all taxes and duties owed the King within a provostship&#x27;s jurisdiction. They were also responsible for military defense such as raising local contingents for royal armies. The provosts also administered justice though with limited jurisdiction.

In the 11th century, the provosts tended increasingly to make their positions hereditary and thus became more difficult to control. One of the King&#x27;s great officers, the Great Seneschal, became their supervisor. In the 12th century, the office of provost was put up for bidding, and thereafter provosts were farmers of revenues. The provost thus received the speculative right to collect the King&#x27;s seignorial revenues within his provostship. This remained his primary role.

To monitor the performance and curtail abuses of the prévôts or their equivalent (in Normandy a &quot;vicomte&quot;, in parts of northern France a &quot;châtelain&quot;, in the south a &quot;viguier&quot; or a &quot;bayle&quot;), Philip II Augustus, an able and ingenious administrator who founded many of the central institutions on which the French monarchy&#x27;s system of power would be based, established itinerant justices known as &quot;baillis&quot; (&quot;bailiff&quot;) based on medieval fiscal and tax divisions which had been used by earlier sovereign princes (such as the Duke of Normandy). The &quot;bailli&quot; was thus the king&#x27;s administrative representative in northern France responsible for the application of justice and control of the administration and local finances in his &quot;baillage&quot; (in the south of France, the equivalent post was &quot;sénéchal, sénéchaussé&quot;).

Over time, the role of the baillages would be greatly extended as extensions of royal power, administration and justice. With the office of Great Seneschal vacant after 1191, the bailies became stationary and established themselves as powerful officials superior to provosts. A bailie&#x27;s district included about half a dozen provostships. When appeals were instituted by the Crown, appeal of provost judgments, formerly impossible, now lay with the bailie. Moreover, in the 14th century, provosts no longer were in charge of collecting domainal revenues, except in farmed provostships, having instead yielded this responsibility to royal receivers (receveurs royaux). Raising local army contingents (ban and arrière-ban) also passed to bailies. Provosts therefore retained the sole function of inferior judges over vassals with original jurisdiction concurrent with bailies over claims against nobles and actions reserved for royal courts (&quot;cas royaux&quot;). This followed a precedent established in the chief feudal courts in the 13th and 14th centuries in which summary provostship suits were distinguished from solemn bailliary sessions.

==Political history==
===Carolingian legacy===

During the later years of the elderly Charlemagne&#x27;s rule, the Vikings made advances along the northern and western perimeters of his kingdom. After Charlemagne&#x27;s death in 814 his heirs were incapable of maintaining political unity and the empire began to crumble. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 divided the Carolingian Empire, and Charles the Bald ruled over West Francia, roughly corresponding to the territory of modern France.

Viking advances were allowed to escalate, and their dreaded longboats were sailing up the Loire and Seine Rivers and other inland waterways, wreaking havoc and spreading terror. In 843 Viking invaders murdered the Bishop of Nantes, and a few years after that, they burned the Church of Saint Martin at Tours, and in 845 the Vikings sacked Paris. During the reign of Charles the Simple (898–922), Normans under Rollo were settled in an area on either side of the Seine River, downstream from Paris, that was to become Normandy.

The Carolingians were subsequently to share the fate of their predecessors: after an intermittent power struggle between the two families, the accession (987) of Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, established on the throne the Capetian dynasty which with its Valois and Bourbon offshoots was to rule France for more than 800 years.

The Carolingian era had seen the gradual emergence of institutions which were to condition France&#x27;s development for centuries to come: the acknowledgement by the crown of the administrative authority of the realm&#x27;s nobles within their territories in return for their (sometimes tenuous) loyalty and military support, a phenomenon readily visible in the rise of the Capetians and foreshadowed to some extent by the Carolingians&#x27; own rise to power.

===The First Capetians (940–1108)===

The history of medieval France starts with the election of Hugh Capet (940–996) by an assembly summoned in Reims in 987. Capet was previously &quot;Duke of the Franks&quot; and then became &quot;King of the Franks&quot; (Rex Francorum). Hugh&#x27;s lands extended little beyond the Paris basin; his political unimportance weighed against the powerful barons who elected him. Many of the king&#x27;s vassals (who included for a long time the kings of England) ruled over territories far greater than his own. He was recorded to be recognised king by the Gauls, Bretons, Danes, Aquitanians, Goths, Spanish and Gascons. The new dynasty was in immediate control of little beyond the middle Seine and adjacent territories, while powerful territorial lords such as the 10th- and 11th-century counts of Blois accumulated large domains of their own through marriage and through private arrangements with lesser nobles for protection and support.

Count Borell of Barcelona called for Hugh&#x27;s help against Islamic raids, but even if Hugh intended to help Borell, he was otherwise occupied in fighting Charles of Lorraine. The loss of other Spanish principalities then followed, as the Spanish marches grew more and more independent. Hugh Capet, the first Capetian king, is not a well documented figure, his greatest achievement being certainly to survive as king and defeating the Carolingian claimant, thus allowing him to establish what would become one of Europe&#x27;s most powerful house of kings.

Hugh&#x27;s son – Robert the Pious – was crowned King of the Franks before Capet&#x27;s demise. Hugh Capet decided so in order to have his succession secured. Robert II, as King of the Franks, met Holy Roman Emperor Henry II in 1023 on the borderline. They agreed to end all claims over each other&#x27;s realm, setting a new stage of Capetian and Ottonian relationships. Although a king weak in power, Robert II&#x27;s efforts were considerable. His surviving charters imply he relied heavily on the Church to rule France, much like his father did. Although he lived with a mistress – Bertha of Burgundy – and was excommunicated because of this, he was regarded as a model of piety for monks (hence his nickname, Robert the Pious). The reign of Robert II was quite important because it involved the Peace and Truce of God (beginning in 989) and the Cluniac Reforms.

Robert II crowned his son – Hugh Magnus – as King of the Franks at age 10 to secure the succession, but Hugh Magnus rebelled against his father and died fighting him in 1025.

The next King of the Franks was Robert II&#x27;s next son, Henry I (reigned 1027–1060). Like Hugh Magnus, Henry was crowned as co-ruler with his father (1027), in the Capetian tradition, but he had little power or influence as junior king while his father still lived. Henry I was crowned after Robert&#x27;s death in 1031, which is quite exceptional for a French king of the times. Henry I was one of the weakest kings of the Franks, and his reign saw the rise of some very powerful nobles such as William the Conqueror. Henry I&#x27;s biggest source of concerns was his brother – Robert I of Burgundy – who was pushed by his mother to the conflict. Robert of Burgundy was made Duke of Burgundy by King Henry I and had to be satisfied with that title. From Henry I onward, the Dukes of Burgundy were relatives of the King of the Franks until the end of the Duchy proper.

King Philip I, named by his Kievan mother with a typically Eastern European name, was no more fortunate than his predecessor although the kingdom did enjoy a modest recovery during his extraordinarily long reign (1060–1108). His reign also saw the launch of the First Crusade to regain the Holy Land, which heavily involved his family although he personally did not support the expedition.

The area around the lower Seine, ceded to Scandinavian invaders as the Duchy of Normandy in 911, became a source of particular concern when Duke William took possession of the kingdom of England in the Norman Conquest of 1066, making himself and his heirs the King&#x27;s equal outside France (where he was still nominally subject to the Crown).

===Louis VI and Louis VII (1108–1180)===
It is from Louis VI (reigned 1108–1137) onward that royal authority became more accepted. Louis VI was more a soldier and warmongering king than a scholar. The way the king raised money from his vassals made him quite unpopular; he was described as greedy and ambitious and that is corroborated by records of the time. His regular attacks on his vassals, although damaging the royal image, reinforced the royal power. From 1127 onward Louis had the assistance of a skilled religious statesman, Abbot Suger. The abbot was the son of a minor family of knights, but his political advice was extremely valuable to the king. Louis VI successfully defeated, both military and politically, many of the robber barons. Louis VI frequently summoned his vassals to the court, and those who did not show up often had their land possessions confiscated and military campaigns mounted against them. This drastic policy clearly imposed some royal authority on Paris and its surrounding areas. When Louis VI died in 1137, much progress had been made towards strengthening Capetian authority.

Thanks to Abbot Suger&#x27;s political advice, King Louis VII (junior king 1131–1137, senior king 1137–1180) enjoyed greater moral authority over France than his predecessors. Powerful vassals paid homage to the French king. Abbot Suger arranged the 1137 marriage between Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine in Bordeaux, which made Louis VII Duke of Aquitaine and gave him considerable power. However, the couple disagreed over the burning of more than a thousand people in Vitry during the conflict against the Count of Champagne.

King Louis VII was deeply horrified by the event and sought penitence by going to the Holy Land. He later involved the Kingdom of France in the Second Crusade but his relationship with Eleanor did not improve. The marriage was ultimately annulled by the pope under the pretext of consanguinity and Eleanor soon married the Duke of Normandy – Henry Fitzempress, who would become King of England as Henry II two years later. Louis VII was once a very powerful monarch and was now facing a much stronger vassal, who was his equal as King of England and his strongest prince as Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine.

(Henry had inherited the Duchy of Normandy through his mother, Mathilda of England, and the County of Anjou from his father, Geoffrey of Anjou, and in 1152, he had married France&#x27;s newly divorced ex-queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, who ruled much of southwest France. After defeating a revolt led by Eleanor and three of their four sons, Henry had Eleanor imprisoned, made the Duke of Brittany his vassal, and in effect ruled the western half of France as a greater power than the French throne. However, disputes among Henry&#x27;s descendants over the division of his French territories, coupled with John of England&#x27;s lengthy quarrel with Philip II, allowed Philip II to recover influence over most of this territory. After the French victory at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, the English monarchs maintained power only in southwestern Duchy of Guyenne.)

Abbot Suger&#x27;s vision of construction became what is now known as Gothic architecture. This style became standard for most European cathedrals built in the late Middle Ages.

The late direct Capetian kings were considerably more powerful and influential than the earliest ones. While Philip I could hardly control his Parisian barons, Philip IV could dictate popes and emperors. The late Capetians, although they often ruled for a shorter time than their earlier peers, were often much more influential. This period also saw the rise of a complex system of international alliances and conflicts opposing, through dynasties, Kings of France and England and Holy Roman Emperor.

===Philip II Augustus and Louis VIII (1180–1226)===
The reign of Philip II Augustus (junior king 1179–1180, senior king 1180–1223) marked an important step in the history of French monarchy. His reign saw the French royal domain and influence greatly expanded. He set the context for the rise of power to much more powerful monarchs like Saint Louis and Philip the Fair.

Philip II spent an important part of his reign fighting the so-called Angevin Empire, which was probably the greatest threat to the King of France since the rise of the Capetian dynasty. During the first part of his reign Philip II tried using Henry II of England&#x27;s son against him. He allied himself with the Duke of Aquitaine and son of Henry II – Richard Lionheart – and together they launched a decisive attack on Henry&#x27;s castle and home of Chinon and removed him from power.

Richard replaced his father as King of England afterward. The two kings then went crusading during the Third Crusade; however, their alliance and friendship broke down during the crusade. The two men were once again at odds and fought each other in France until Richard was on the verge of totally defeating Philip II.

Adding to their battles in France, the Kings of France and England were trying to install their respective allies at the head of the Holy Roman Empire. If Philip II Augustus supported Philip of Swabia, member of the House of Hohenstaufen, then Richard Lionheart supported Otto IV, member of the House of Welf. Philip of Swabia had the upper hand, but his premature death made Otto IV Holy Roman Emperor. The crown of France was saved by Richard&#x27;s demise after a wound he received fighting his own vassals in Limousin.

John Lackland, Richard&#x27;s successor, refused to come to the French court for a trial against the Lusignans and, as Louis VI had done often to his rebellious vassals, Philip II confiscated John&#x27;s possessions in France. John&#x27;s defeat was swift and his attempts to reconquer his French possession at the decisive Battle of Bouvines (1214) resulted in complete failure. The annexation of Normandy and Anjou was confirmed, the Counts of Boulogne and Flanders were captured, and the Emperor Otto IV was overthrown by Philip&#x27;s ally Frederick II. Aquitaine and Gascony survived the French conquest, for the Duchess Eleanor still lived. Philip II of France was crucial in ordering Western European politics in both England and France.

Philip Augustus founded the Sorbonne and made Paris a city for scholars.

Prince Louis (the future Louis VIII, reigned 1223–1226) was involved in the subsequent English civil war as French and English (or rather Anglo-Norman) aristocracies were once one and were now split between allegiances. While the French kings were struggling against the Plantagenets, the Church called for the Albigensian Crusade. Southern France was then largely absorbed in the royal domains.

===Saint Louis (1226–1270)===
France became a truly centralised kingdom under Louis IX (reigned 1226–1270). Saint Louis has often been portrayed as a one-dimensional character, a flawless example of the faith and an administrative reformer who cared for the governed ones. However, his reign was far from perfect for everyone: he made unsuccessful crusades, his expanding administrations raised opposition, and he burned Jewish books at the Pope&#x27;s urging. His judgments were not often practical, although they seemed fair by the standards of the time. It appears Louis had a strong sense of justice and always wanted to judge people himself before applying any sentence. This was said about Louis and French clergy asking for excommunications of Louis&#x27; vassals:

Louis IX was only twelve years old when he became King of France. His mother – Blanche of Castile – was the effective power as regent (although she did not formally use the title). Blanche&#x27;s authority was strongly opposed by the French barons yet she maintained her position until Louis was old enough to rule by himself.

In 1229 the King had to struggle with a long-lasting strike at the University of Paris. The Latin Quarter was strongly hit by these strikes.

The kingdom was vulnerable: war was still going on in the County of Toulouse, and the royal army was occupied fighting resistance in Languedoc. Count Raymond VII of Toulouse finally signed the Treaty of Paris in 1229, in which he retained much of his lands for life, but his daughter, married to Count Alfonso of Poitou, produced him no heir and so the County of Toulouse went to the King of France.

King Henry III of England had not yet recognized the Capetian overlordship over Aquitaine and still hoped to recover Normandy and Anjou and reform the Angevin Empire. He landed in 1230 at Saint-Malo with a massive force. Henry III&#x27;s allies in Brittany and Normandy fell down because they did not dare fight their king, who led the counterstrike himself. This evolved into the Saintonge War (1242).

Ultimately, Henry III was defeated and had to recognize Louis IX&#x27;s overlordship, although the King of France did not seize Aquitaine from Henry III. Louis IX was now the most important landowner of France, adding to his royal title. There were some opposition to his rule in Normandy, yet it proved remarkably easy to rule, especially compared to the County of Toulouse which had been brutally conquered. The Conseil du Roi, which would evolve into the Parlement, was founded in these times.

After his conflict with King Henry III of England, Louis established a cordial relation with the Plantagenet King. An amusing anecdote is about Henry III&#x27;s attending the French Parlement, as Duke of Aquitaine; however, the King of England was always late because he liked to stop each time he met a priest to hear the mass, so Louis made sure no priest was on the way of Henry III. Henry III and Louis IX then started a long contest for who was the most faithful; this evolved to the point that none ever arrived on time to the Parlement, which was then allowed to debate in their absence.

Saint Louis also supported new forms of art such as Gothic architecture; his Sainte-Chapelle became a very famous gothic building, and he is also credited for the Morgan Bible.

The Kingdom was involved in two crusades under Saint Louis: the Seventh Crusade and the Eighth Crusade. Both proved to be complete failures for the French King. He died in the Eighth Crusade and Philip III became king.

The 13th century was to bring the crown important gains also in the south, where a papal-royal crusade against the region&#x27;s Albigensian or Cathar heretics (1209) led to the incorporation into the royal domain of Lower (1229) and Upper (1271) Languedoc. Philip IV&#x27;s seizure of Flanders (1300) was less successful, ending two years later in the rout of his knights by the forces of the Flemish cities at the Battle of the Golden Spurs near Kortrijk (Courtrai).

===Philip III and Philip IV (1270–1314)===
After Louis IX died of bubonic plague crusading in Tunisia in 1270, his son Philip III (1270–1285) and grandson Philip IV (1285–1314) followed him. Philip III was called &quot;the Bold&quot; on the basis of his abilities in combat and on horseback, and not because of his character or ruling abilities. Philip III took part in another crusading disaster: the Aragonese Crusade, which cost him his life in 1285.

Philip III continued the steady expansion of the royal domain. He inherited Toulouse in 1271 from his uncle and married his son and heir to the heiress of Champagne and Navarre.

After taking the throne, Philip III felt obliged to continue his father&#x27;s apparently solid diplomacy despite circumstances having changed. In 1282, the misrule of Charles of Anjou in Sicily compelled the island&#x27;s populace to rebel in favor of King Peter III of Aragon. As Pope Martin IV was a close ally of Philip, he immediately excommunicated Peter and offered his throne to one of the French king&#x27;s sons. Since Philip the Fair was already slated to inherit Navarre, the entire Spanish March seemed ripe for reconquest by France. However, Philip III&#x27;s attempted crusade against Aragon, a blatantly political affair, ended in disaster as an epidemic struck his army, which then was soundly defeated by Aragonese forces at Col de Panissars. The humiliated king died shortly afterwards in Perpignan, followed by Charles of Anjou and Martin IV.

Of the later Capetian rulers, Philip IV was the greatest, bringing royal power to the strongest level it would attain in the Middle Ages, yet alienated a great many people and generally left France exhausted. As such, his sons were obliged to follow a more restrained course without however abandoning their father&#x27;s ambitions. Philip IV for the most part ignored the Mediterranean and instead focused his foreign policy efforts on France&#x27;s northern frontiers. Some of this was done at the expense of the Holy Roman Emperors, but the king&#x27;s most aggressive actions were against England. Disputes over Aquitaine were a bone of contention for years and finally in 1294, war broke out. The French armies drove deep into Gascony, leading to Edward I of England joining forces with Flanders and other allies on the northern borders of France. The allied forces were soundly beaten in 1297 by a French army led by Robert of Artois and a truce was agreed to, leading to preservation of the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;. As part of the peace arrangement, Edward married Philip&#x27;s sister and the son and daughter of both kings were slated to marry.

Flanders remained stubbornly rebellious and insubordinate. Although their count had been imprisoned by Philip, this did not prevent the Flemish burghers from rising up against French troops stationed there, inflicting a sensational defeat on them at the 1302 Battle of Courtrai. Eventually however, the king began a new offensive into Flanders and a peace was finally agreed to in 1305 which however still failed to placate the Flemish townsmen.

In addition, Philip IV extended royal jurisdiction by treaty into the ecclesiastical territories of Vivers, Cahors, Mende, and Le Puy. With all this, the king could now assert power nearly anywhere in France, yet there was still a great deal of work yet to be done and French rulers for the time being continued to do without Brittany, Burgundy, and numerous lesser territories although they legislated for the whole realm. Governmental administration in France during this period became more bureaucratic and sophisticated along with the steady expansion of royal power. Even so, the Capetian kings should not be taken as arbitrary tyrants since feudal custom and tradition still acted as restraints on them.

If Philip&#x27;s policies provoked hostility and complaints, it was because they favored no class in particular. The king&#x27;s policy towards the towns remained fairly traditional, but this was not the case with the Church. When he wanted to tax French clergy to fund military campaigns, he encountered the objection of Pope Boniface VIII. The pope had received a number of complaints from French and English clergy over lay taxes and thus issued the bull &quot;Clericis lacios&quot; in 1296 declaring that papal consent was necessary for this. Philip however became infuriated and issued loud arguments in defense of his actions, leaving the clergy divided over the matter. Eventually the pope withdrew his objection.

In 1301, fresh trouble erupted when the Bishop of Pamiers was accused by the King of heresy and treason, leading to another protest from Boniface VIII that Church property could not be confiscated without Rome&#x27;s permission and all Christian rulers were subordinate to papal authority. The pope summoned French clergy to the Vatican to debate a reform of the kingdom. Once again the prelates were left divided between loyalty to their country and loyalty to the Church. Those who took the side of Philip met in a large assembly in Paris along with other segments of French society criticizing the Pope, who responded by excommunicating the king and all clergy who had supported him. The following year, Philip struck back with a vengeance. Prelates loyal to the crown formed a scheme to bring Boniface to trial, and the Pope was summarily arrested at Anagni that September. He was beaten by his jailers and threatened with execution if he did not resign the papacy, but he refused. The 68-year-old Pope was released from captivity after only a few days and died several weeks later.

Philip ensured that he would never again have trouble with the Church by promoting Raymond Bertrand de Got, archbishop of Bordeaux, as the next Pope. The papal conclave was evenly divided between French and Italian cardinals, but the latter acquiesced and de Got became Pope Clement V. Thus, Philip successfully installed an obedient French puppet in the papacy that was moved to Avignon.

More administrative reforms were made by Philip IV, also called Philip the Fair (reigned 1285–1314). This king signed the Auld Alliance, and established the Parlement of Paris.

One of the more bizarre episodes of Philip&#x27;s reign was his involvement in the destruction of the Knights Templar. The Templars had been founded during the Crusades more than a century earlier, but now consisted of old men whose prestige was greatly diminished after the fall of the Holy Land and no longer seemed to serve any useful purpose worth their privileges. Unable to find suitable evidence of misdeeds by the Templars to justify disposing of the order, Philip had to resort to a mass meeting at Tours in 1308 to rally support. Finally in 1312, Clement V, despite his misgivings, issued a bull ordering their dissolution. The Templars&#x27; possessions were handed over to the Knights Hospitallers and their remaining members imprisoned or executed for heresy.

===Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV (1314–1328)===

In 1314, Philip IV died abruptly in a hunting accident at the age of 47 and the throne passed to his son Louis X (1314–1316). Louis&#x27;s brief reign saw further unsuccessful attempts to assert control over Flanders as the king mobilized an army along the border, but supply problems caused the effort to break down. Louis died in the summer of 1316 at only 26 of an unknown illness (possibly gastroenteritis) after consuming a large quantity of chilled wine following a game of tennis on an extremely hot day. The king&#x27;s wife was then pregnant and gave birth to a son, John, in November, but he died after a week and the throne passed to his brother Philip.

Philip V (1316–1322) made peace with Flanders via a marriage compact with its count Robert III and faced continued quarrels with Edward II of England over Gascony. He made plans for a new crusade to relieve the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, but the Flanders situation remained unstable and an attempted French naval expedition to the Middle East was destroyed off Genoa in 1319. At this point, peasants and soldiers originally intended to invade Flanders rose in another self-proclaimed crusade (Pastoreux) which once again turned into an assault on the nobility, tax collectors, and Jews. Pope John XXII denounced the uprising and Philip was forced to send troops to break it up.

In 1321, a rumor began spreading through the country that Jews in the employ of foreign Muslim rulers were using lepers to poison drinking wells. With the Pastoreux still fresh in everyone&#x27;s mind, a volatile situation had formed especially as Philip V granted tolerance to Jews and even employed a number of them in his service. With the king facing potential disaster no matter what side he took, his health began to fail from stress and he succumbed at the start of 1322, only 29 years old.

Having failed to produce a son that survived infancy, Philip was succeeded by his brother (and the youngest of Philip IV&#x27;s sons) Charles IV (1322–1328). The new king faced much of the same problems as his predecessors (namely the quarrels over Flanders and Gascony). Having put an end to the chaos in southern France that his brother faced, he turned his attention to Flanders, but then a revolt broke out in Gascony over the unwelcome construction of a fortress on the border by a French vassal. The king&#x27;s uncle Charles of Valois invaded the province, whereupon the former declared Edward II&#x27;s claims to it null and void. Although Charles IV&#x27;s sister married the English king, he still refused to return Gascony and finally came to an agreement to divide it up among the two rulers.

Charles was also eager to begin a new crusade in the Levant and had once plotted to become Byzantine emperor. He failed to work out an agreement with the Pope over funding the expedition however, and his attention was distracted by the events in Gascony. But in 1327, a French ambassador traveled to Constantinople and found the Byzantine Empire beset by civil wars. The following year, Charles IV died, ending any plans for crusades in the region.

===The Hundred Years&#x27; War (1328–1453)===
The death of Charles IV in 1328 without male heirs ended the main Capetian line. Under Salic law the crown could not pass through a woman (Philip IV&#x27;s daughter was Isabella, whose son was Edward III of England), so the throne passed to Philip VI, son of Charles of Valois. This, in addition to a long-standing dispute over the rights to Gascony in the south of France, and the relationship between England and the Flemish cloth towns, led to the Hundred Years&#x27; War of 1337–1453. The following century was to see devastating warfare and peasant revolts (the English peasants&#x27; revolt of 1381 and the &quot;Jacquerie&quot; of 1358 in France).

French losses in the first phase of the conflict (1337–1360) were partly reversed in the second (1369–1396); but Henry V&#x27;s shattering victory at the battle of Agincourt in 1415 against a France now bitterly divided between rival Armagnac and Burgundian factions of the royal house was to lead to his son Henry VI&#x27;s recognition as king in Paris seven years later under the 1420 Treaty of Troyes, reducing Valois rule to the lands south of the Loire River Valley.

France&#x27;s humiliation was abruptly reversed in 1429 by the appearance of a restorationist movement embodied by the peasant maid Joan of Arc from Domremy la Pucelle, who claimed the guidance of divine voices for the campaign which rapidly ended the English siege of Orléans and ended in Charles VII&#x27;s coronation in the historic city of Rheims. Subsequently, captured by the Burgundians and sold to their English allies, her execution for heresy in 1431 redoubled her value as the embodiment of France&#x27;s cause.
Reconciliation in 1435 between the king and Philippe the Good, duke of Burgundy, removed the greatest obstacle to French recovery, leading to the recapture of Paris (1436), Normandy (1450) and Guienne (1453), reducing England&#x27;s foothold to a small area around Calais (lost also in 1558). After victory over England, France&#x27;s emergence as a powerful national monarchy was crowned by the &quot;incorporation&quot; of the Duchies of Burgundy (1477) and Brittany (1532), which had previously been independent European states.

The losses of the century of war were enormous, particularly owing to the plague (the Black Death, usually considered an outbreak of bubonic plague), which arrived from Italy in 1348, spreading rapidly up the Rhone valley and thence across most of the country: it is estimated that a population of some 18–20 million in modern-day France at the time of the 1328 hearth tax returns had been reduced 150 years later by 50% or more.
The tensions between the Houses of Plantagenet and Capet climaxed during the so-called Hundred Years&#x27; War (actually several distinct wars over the period 1337 to 1453) when the Plantagenets claimed the throne of France from the Valois. This was also the time of the Black Death, as well as several civil wars. The French population suffered much from these wars. In 1420 Henry V was made heir to Charles VI by the Treaty of Troyes. Henry V failed to outlive Charles so it was Henry VI of England and France who consolidated the dual monarchy of England and France.

It has been argued that the difficult conditions the French population suffered during the Hundred Years&#x27; War awakened French nationalism, a nationalism represented by Joan of Arc (1412–1431). Although this is debatable, the Hundred Years&#x27; War is remembered more as a Franco-English war than as a succession of feudal struggles. During this war, France evolved politically and militarily.

Although a Franco-Scottish army was successful at the Battle of Baugé (1421), the humiliating defeats of Poitiers (1356) and Agincourt (1415) forced the French nobility to realise they could not stand just as armoured knights without an organised army. Charles VII (reigned 1422–1461) established the first French standing army, the Compagnies d&#x27;ordonnance, and defeated the Plantagenets once at Patay (1429) and again, using cannons, at Formigny (1450). The Battle of Castillon (1453) was regarded as the last engagement of this &quot;war&quot;, yet Calais and the Channel Islands remained ruled by the Plantagenets.

===Jewish-Christian Relations in France===


In the Middle Ages, France was primarily made up of a Christian population that maintained a positive relationship with the Jewish minority. In a historical sense, Christians and Jews both made generalizations about the success of their community relations in medieval France. The history of Jewish-Christian relations was focused primarily on the persecution that Jews faced in a prominently Christian world. In France, however, there were many examples of Jewish and Christian people working together towards a prosperity that was beneficial to both religions. They conducted business together, as well as participated in intimate social affairs. While the Jews would never fully assimilate into French culture by choice, they were accepted by the Christians in their societies.

After years of peace, in the 13th Century, Louis IX became obsessed with restricting Jewish activities. Eventually, after the Jewish population suffered multiple expulsions from France, the anti-Jewish rhetoric gained some popularity in small villages and towns. Jews began to face a fatal price for practicing their religious traditions. This discriminatory action promoted by the Royals, did not take hold with the general civilian populations in large cities because a large population of Christians permitted and accepted the differing Jewish faith.

Small communities however, incorporated these prejudiced ideas into their beliefs, which led to some instances of blood libels which took many Jewish lives. Blood Libels consisted of accusations directed at small Jewish communities that promoted a false belief that there was a sacrificial aspect in Jewish prayer. These falsities proclaimed that a Jewish religious event included the sacrifice of a Christian child. In Blois, France, as many as 40 Jews were accused of killing a young Christian boy. They were found guilty and killed. Though Blood Libels and persecution did not define Jewish-Christian relations in the Middle-Ages in France, it had a large impact on the way the history of this time period is recited.

==Economy and technology==

The period after the death of Charlemagne was marked by an economic crisis caused by political instability; town life all but disappeared. However, this had changed by the 11th century. The introduction of new crops, the improvements in the climate, and the introduction of new agricultural technologies created a large agricultural surplus. This was accompanied by the growth in town life, trade, and industry. The economy once again collapsed in the fourteenth century because of war, bad weather, and the Black Death.

The rural economy was based on the manor; in urban areas economic activity was organized around guilds.

===Art and music===
Art was a large staple of the medieval France. Illuminated manuscripts were diligently written and illustrated within this period, some notable examples include the &quot;Hours of Philip the Bold&quot;, the &quot;Hours of Jeanne d&#x27;Evreux&quot; and the &quot;Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot; of the 14th and 15th centuries. Some of the earliest painters lived in the Later Middle Ages in France such as Jacquemart de Hesdin, Jean de Beaumetz and Colart de Laon. While in music, the Ars antiqua musical style was common in the High Middle Ages and Ars nova in the Later Middle Ages. A group of composers from the Notre-Dame school, were active during Ars antiqua period, arguably the most famous being the 12th-century Léonin and Pérotin. Troubadour culture flourished after the 12th century, exemplified by famous personages of the High Middle Ages such as Perdigon, Bertran de Born and Raimbaut de Vaqueiras among others.

<text>Gilmore Girls is an American comedy drama television series created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, starring Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel. The show debuted October 5, 2000, on The WB and became a flagship series for the network. The show ran for seven seasons, with the last being aired on The CW, and ended on May 15, 2007.

&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; received critical acclaim for its witty dialogue, cross-generational appeal, and effective mix of humor and drama. It was a great success for The WB, peaking during season five as the network&#x27;s second-most-popular show. The series has been in daily syndication since 2004, while a growing following has led to its status as a 2000s American cult classic. Since going off the air in 2007, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; has been cited in &quot;TV (The Book)&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time. It has also become one of the most watched shows on streaming platforms since it became available on Netflix in 2014 and reaired on The CW. In 2016, the original main cast and Sherman-Palladino returned for the four-part miniseries revival &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;.

== Premise ==

&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; follows the lives of single mother Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and her academically-minded teenage daughter, Lorelai &quot;Rory&quot; Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), who live in the quaint, fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. Lorelai dreams of owning her own inn, and Rory plans to attend Harvard University.

The show&#x27;s pilot introduces Lorelai&#x27;s estranged, wealthy parents, Emily (Kelly Bishop) and Richard Gilmore (Edward Hermann), whom Lorelai must approach for assistance in paying Rory&#x27;s tuition to attend the prestigious Chilton Preparatory School. They agree to pay, on the condition that Lorelai and Rory have dinner with them every Friday, which sets up one of the show&#x27;s primary conflicts, as the Gilmores are now forced to face their differences and complicated past, including Lorelai&#x27;s giving birth to Rory at the age of 16, with her then-boyfriend Christopher Hayden (David Sutcliffe). 

Rory&#x27;s best friend, Lane Kim (Keiko Agena), must navigate through life concealing her &quot;rebellious&quot; interests from her authoritarian mother, Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), a strict, religious, Korean immigrant. She finds ways, often peculiar ways, to secretly date, listen to rock music, and express her love for pop culture, while Mrs. Kim repeatedly attempts to set up Lane with a Korean boy who will be a future doctor. After many set ups, Lane falls in love with a member of her band, Dave Rygalski (Adam Brody). The character of Dave was written out in the following season to accommodate actor Adam Brody&#x27;s exit. Lane then fell in love with another band member, Zach Van Gerbig, (Todd Lowe) and they have twin children.

Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) is Lorelai&#x27;s best friend and chef at the Independence Inn, where they both work. She has a bubbly personality and is accident-prone, but is known for her profound cooking skills. Later, she becomes romantically involved with the inn&#x27;s vegetable supplier, Jackson Belleville (Jackson Douglas). Then they also reunite.

Also central to &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; is Luke Danes (Scott Patterson), owner of Luke&#x27;s Diner, where Lorelai and Rory frequently dine. Present for many of Rory&#x27;s milestones, he has become to her a sort of father figure. Later, Luke and Lorelai begin a romantic relationship. In &quot;A year in the Life&quot;, Lorelai and Luke get married in the last episode.

The townspeople of Stars Hollow are also a constant presence—including the gossiping, flirtatious Miss Patty (Liz Torres) and quirky Kirk Gleason (Sean Gunn). Along with series-long and season-long arcs, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; is also episodic in nature, with mini-plots within each episode, such as town festivals, problems at Lorelai&#x27;s inn, or school projects of Rory&#x27;s.

==Synopsis==

=== Season 1 ===

Rory Gilmore is accepted by Chilton, a private school that can help her get into Harvard. Because of the school&#x27;s steep price tag, her mother Lorelai Gilmore talks to her wealthy parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, with whom she had broken contact for a long time. They had a falling out because of Lorelai&#x27;s teen pregnancy and parenting choices. They are not involved in one another&#x27;s lives much, aside from holidays. Emily and Richard agree to pay the tuition on the condition that Lorelai and Rory have Friday night dinners with them, as an attempt to reconnect the family. Lorelai reluctantly agrees to this condition, only because there is no other way for her to afford Rory&#x27;s schooling. Rory has a difficult time settling in at Chilton, struggling to meet the demands of private school and attracting the fury of classmate Paris Geller, her academic rival. Paris focuses a lot of her attention on making sure that Rory does not have opportunities to succeed at Chilton and at the school&#x27;s clubs. She meets her first boyfriend, Dean Forester, but the pair break up when Rory does not reciprocate his &quot;I love you&quot;, instead saying she needs to think about it. Rory spends the remainder of the season saddened by her break up. After being romantically pursued by Rory&#x27;s teacher, Max Medina, Lorelai decides, with a conflicted heart, to give the relationship a chance. This dynamic creates some tension between Lorelai and Rory. Eventually, Lorelai becomes frightened by her feelings for Max, as well as Rory accepting him and calling him by his first name, and she attempts to break up with him at Rory&#x27;s school on Parents&#x27; Day. Instead, they end up kissing at school and are seen by Paris, who immediately tells the whole school. After this, Max decides that they should take a break because of the negative feedback from his boss. At the same time, Lorelai harbors a close friendship with local diner owner Luke Danes, and several people comment on their mutual attraction—but Lorelai is in denial and Luke does not act on it. Rory&#x27;s father, Christopher Hayden, returns and also wants to be with Lorelai but she tells him he is too immature for family life. All the while, Lorelai struggles to adjust to having her parents in her life on a regular basis. Emily and Richard enjoy developing a relationship with their granddaughter, but also realize how much they have missed. The season ends with Rory reuniting with Dean, and Max proposing to Lorelai. Throughout the season, Rory and Lorelai&#x27;s unique mother-daughter relationship is tested as they both navigate their respective social worlds—Rory in the academically intense environment of Chilton and Lorelai in the close-knit Stars Hollow community. Lorelai also faces the struggle of balancing her independence with her family&#x27;s growing presence, especially as Emily begins to love subtly influencing Rory&#x27;s life and future plans. The season explores themes of family obligation, ambition, and personal growth, as Lorelai and Rory gradually build a bridge between the Gilmore legacy and their own dreams.

She and her best friend Sookie St. James get excited about opening their own business at the dilapidated Dragonfly Inn but the owner refuses to sell. Sookie gets engaged to Jackson Belleville, a local farmer. Luke&#x27;s teenage nephew, Jess Mariano, comes to live under his care. Jess is sullen and angry with everyone apart from Rory. The two strike up a friendship, causing jealousy from Dean. Lorelai is disapproving of their closeness, labeling Jess as a bad influence, especially when they are in a car accident, in which Rory breaks her wrist. This leads to a blow-up between Lorelai and Luke. Richard announces that he has retired but soon becomes bored and sets up his own insurance company. Christopher appears to have his life together and Lorelai decides to reunite with him.

Meanwhile, she and Paris spend the year as Student Body Presidents at Chilton and both submit applications to Harvard University. They spend a portion of the season in a rivalry with fellow student Francie Jarvis, who causes a rift between Paris and Rory. Paris and Rory eventually make amends when Paris confides in her that she lost her virginity. Rory&#x27;s college decision plays a big part in her senior year.

Rory gets an internship at Logan&#x27;s father Mitchum&#x27;s newspaper but is deflated when Mitchum tells her she &quot;doesn&#x27;t have it.&quot; Rory lashes out afterwards and suggests to Logan, at his sister Honor Huntzberger&#x27;s engagement party, that they steal a yacht. The two are arrested, and Rory later announces to Lorelai that she is quitting Yale, and moves into Richard and Emily&#x27;s pool house.

When Lorelai finds out that Luke organized it, the pair reconcile with a kiss. Lorelai promises Emily that she will continue attending Friday night dinners. Before Lorelai and Rory have to say goodbye, they have one last breakfast at Luke&#x27;s Diner.

=== &quot;A Year in the Life&quot; ===
Nine years after the end of the original series, Netflix produced a &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; revival miniseries. Rory is struggling in her journalism career and having a no-strings-attached, secret affair with Logan in London, while technically having a boyfriend named Paul who she often forgets about. While Logan is engaged to be married, the two of them cannot seem to stay apart. Lorelai and Luke live together but are still having communication problems. Richard has recently died of a heart attack, which causes tension between Lorelai and Emily, and they end up in joint therapy. Lorelai starts to question her life, so she travels to California with intentions to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, where she has an epiphany. She fixes the rift with Emily by recounting a happy story about Richard, and goes home to propose to Luke. Emily decides to sell the Gilmore mansion and move to Nantucket, where she starts working in a museum. After encouragement from Jess, Rory decides to write a book about her life called &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. After Luke and Lorelai marry, Rory informs Lorelai that she is pregnant.

The miniseries aired on Up TV and The CW in November 2020, partly because the latter network needed additional programming to fill its schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Production==
=== Background ===
Amy Sherman-Palladino, who came from a background of writing for half-hour sitcoms, had &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; approved by The WB after several of her previous pitches were turned down. On a whim, she suggested a show about a mother and daughter but had put little thought into the idea. Having to create a pilot, she drew inspiration for the show&#x27;s setting of &quot;Stars Hollow, Connecticut&quot;, after making a trip to Washington, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn. She explained: &quot;If I can make people feel this much of what I felt walking around this fairy town, I thought that would be wonderful ... At the time I was there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was a feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie ... There was a longing for that in my own life, and I thought—that&#x27;s something that I would really love to put out there.&quot; Stars Hollow was inspired by and is loosely based on the actual villages of Washington Depot, Connecticut; West Hartford, Connecticut, and the town of New Milford.

Once the setting was established, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; developed as a mixture of sitcom and family drama. Sherman-Palladino&#x27;s aim was to create &quot;A family show that doesn&#x27;t make parents want to stick something sharp in their eyes while they&#x27;re watching it and doesn&#x27;t talk down to kids.&quot; She wanted the family dynamic to be important because &quot;It&#x27;s a constant evolution ... You never run out of conflict.&quot; The show&#x27;s pace, dialogue, and focus on class divisions was heavily inspired by the screwball comedies of the 1930s and Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy films. Sherman-Palladino was also influenced by the &quot;acerbic wit&quot; of Dorothy Parker.

The pilot episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; received financial support from the script development fund of the Family Friendly Programming Forum, which includes some of the nation&#x27;s leading advertisers, making it one of the first networks shows to reach the air with such funding. The show was green-lit by The WB, and Sherman-Palladino proceeded to exercise control over all aspects of its production. Her husband Daniel Palladino was a consultant and occasional writer for the first season, then agreed to quit his producer position on &quot;Family Guy&quot; to commit to &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;; he became an executive producer with the second season, and also played a major role. The show&#x27;s third executive producer was Gavin Polone.

===Casting===

Alexis Bledel was cast in the key role of Rory despite having no previous acting experience. Sherman-Palladino was drawn to her shyness and innocence, which she said was essential for the character, and felt she photographed well. Lauren Graham was pursued by the casting directors from the start of the process, but she was committed to another show on NBC. A week before the shooting, they had still failed to cast Lorelai, so they asked Graham to audition anyway. Sherman-Palladino cast her that day, on the hope that Graham&#x27;s other show (&quot;M.Y.O.B.&quot;, which was burned off as a summer replacement series several months before the premiere of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;) would be canceled, which it soon was. She later explained how Graham met all the criteria she had been looking for: &quot;Lorelai&#x27;s a hard fucking part. You&#x27;ve got to be funny, you&#x27;ve got to talk really fucking fast, you&#x27;ve got to be able to act, you&#x27;ve got to be sexy, but not scary sexy. You&#x27;ve got to be strong, but not like &#x27;I hate men. Graham and Bledel only met the night before they started filming the pilot.

In casting the grandparents, Sherman-Palladino had veteran actor Edward Herrmann in mind for Richard and was delighted when he agreed. Kelly Bishop, a fellow New York stage actress, was cast straight after her audition; Sherman-Palladino recalled knowing immediately &quot;and there&#x27;s Emily&quot;. The role of the Stars Hollow diner owner was originally a woman, but the network reported that they needed more men and Scott Patterson was cast as Luke. It was advertised as a guest role, but Patterson said he treated the pilot as &quot;a chemistry test&quot; and he was promptly promoted to series regular.

In the pilot, Sookie was played by Alex Borstein, but she could not be released from her &quot;Mad TV&quot; contract. She was therefore replaced by Melissa McCarthy, who re-filmed Sookie&#x27;s scenes. The role of Dean also changed after the pilot, with the original actor replaced by a newcomer Jared Padalecki. The character Lane was based on Sherman-Palladino&#x27;s friend and fellow producer Helen Pai; Japanese-American actress Keiko Agena was cast in the role when they could not find an appropriate Korean-American actress. Liza Weil auditioned to play Rory, and while she was considered wrong for the part Sherman-Palladino liked her so much that she wrote the role of Paris especially for her.

=== Writing ===

Headed by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino from seasons 1 to 6, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; had a small writing staff that changed regularly throughout the series. The Palladinos wrote a high percentage of episodes and would review and rework the dialogue in episodes allocated to others. As such, the show is considered to have a distinctive &quot;voice&quot;. Sherman-Palladino said &quot;every draft either I write, or it passes through my hands ... so that there is a consistency of tone. It&#x27;s very important that it feels like the same show every week because it is so verbal.&quot; The main job of the writers&#x27; room was to help develop storylines and create detailed episode outlines. Notable writers who worked on the show at some point include Jenji Kohan, Bill Prady, Jane Espenson, Rebecca Rand Kirshner, and Janet Leahy.

As signaled by its tagline &quot;Life&#x27;s short. Talk fast&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; is known for its fast-paced dialogue and &quot;witty repartee&quot;. Sherman-Palladino wanted a snappy delivery from the characters because she believes that &quot;comedy dies slow&quot;, which required large volumes of dialogue to fill the hour-long time slot. Scripts averaged 80 pages per episode, compared to an &quot;hour-long&quot; average of 55–60 pages, with one page translating to 20–25 seconds of screen time. Scott Patterson later said that the pace of the dialogue led to both him and Lauren Graham quitting smoking—&quot;She needed her wind, and I needed my wind.&quot;

Much of the dialogue is peppered with references to film, television shows, music, literature, and celebrity culture. The range of references is broad, summarized by critic Ken Tucker as &quot;some cross between &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot;&quot;. Sherman-Palladino wanted the characters to speak this way as an indicator of their worldliness and intelligence, and to cater to a broad audience. At the start, she argued with the network about the frequently old-fashioned references; when she refused to remove a comment about Oscar Levant, she felt the executives adopted an attitude of &quot;Let the crazy woman dig her own grave.&quot; The relative obscurity of some of the allusions resulted in explanatory &quot;Gilmore-isms&quot; booklets being included in the DVD sets of the first four seasons.

In contrast to the rapid-fire dialogue, storylines on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; move slowly. Sherman-Palladino&#x27;s motto was &quot;make the small big, make the big small&quot;, which she learned from her days writing for &quot;Roseanne&quot;. She chose to be &quot;very stingy with events&quot;, and the drama is low-key because &quot;sometimes the average everyday things are more impactful&quot;. Key incidents often take place off-screen and are only revealed through character conversations, which journalist Constance Grady says is because &quot;On &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, the explosion is never what matters: It&#x27;s the fallout.&quot; The show similarly uses subtext rather than exposition, &quot;where people will talk a great deal in order to obscure what they really mean to say&quot;. The writers did not like moments to be overly sentimental, preferring characters to show love through actions and behavior. Sherman-Palladino stated that the network did not interfere or request changes, though there is speculation that she delivered scripts at the last minute to avoid their input.

Sherman-Palladino treated Lorelai as a reflection of herself. Her husband commented: &quot;Amy writing for Lorelai Gilmore has always been really special. No surprise, they&#x27;re kind of doppelgängers ... Amy and Lorelai are very, very similar. That character is a great cipher for a lot of what Amy is and has been, from the very beginning.&quot;

===Filming===
The pilot episode was shot in the Toronto suburb of Unionville. The rest of the series was filmed at the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California. Exterior scenes of Stars Hollow, along with those at Luke&#x27;s Diner and Miss Patty&#x27;s dance studio, were all filmed on the backlot — with dozens of background actors utilized to make it look like a functioning town. Production designers regularly had to decorate the town square with fake leaves or fake snow to make it look like a New England fall or winter. Interiors of Lorelai&#x27;s house and inn, and all scenes at Yale and the Gilmore mansion, were filmed on a sound stage. Very occasionally, the show was filmed on location. The exterior shots of Rory&#x27;s preparatory school, Chilton, were filmed at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, California. Rory&#x27;s visit to Harvard was filmed at UCLA, the first visit to Yale was filmed at Pomona College, and subsequent Yale shots were filmed at sound stages in Burbank, California, and USC.

The shot of &quot;Stars Hollow&quot; seen in the first frame of the show&#x27;s opening credits is actually a panoramic view of South Royalton, Vermont.

&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; relied on a master shot filming style, in which a scene is filmed to frame characters and their dialogue together within a long and uninterrupted single take; often illustrated through another method regularly employed on the show, the walk and talk. Sherman-Palladino explained &quot;There&#x27;s an energy and style to our show that&#x27;s very simple, in my mind ... [it] almost needs to be shot like a play. That&#x27;s how we get our pace, our energy, and our flow ... I don&#x27;t think it could work any other way.&quot;

It took eight working days to shoot an episode, and days were regularly 14–20 hours long. Lauren Graham said: &quot;We filmed alongside &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and Aaron Sorkin shows are known for having the worst hours ever, they go on and on, but we were always there even after they had gone home, because you couldn&#x27;t change a word of the script.&quot; The cast were required to be word-perfect in all the scenes, while also reciting large amounts of dialogue at speed. Matt Czuchry, who had a main role for the final three seasons, commented, &quot;The pace of the dialogue was what made that show incredibly unique, and also incredibly difficult as an actor. To be able to maintain that speed, tone, and at the same time, try to make layered choices was a great experience to have early in my career. It really challenged me.&quot; The combination of the difficult dialogue and long takes meant each scene had to be shot many times; Graham said in 2015: &quot;never before or since have I done as many takes of anything&quot;. Alexis Bledel recalled that one scene required 38 takes. Graham added, &quot;That show — as fun and breezy and light as it is — is technically really challenging.&quot;

=== Music ===
&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;″ non-diegetic score was composed by singer-songwriter Sam Phillips throughout its entire run. Sherman-Palladino, who served as the music supervisor of the series, was a big fan of the musician and secured her involvement. For the score&#x27;s instrumental arrangement, Phillips primarily used her voice and an acoustic guitar, and on occasion included piano, violin, and drums. Many of the musical cues are accompanied by melodic &quot;la-la&quot;s and &quot;ahh&quot;s, which developed because Sherman-Palladino wanted the score to sound connected to the girls themselves, almost like &quot;an extension of their thoughts ... if they had music going in their head during a certain emotional thing in their life.&quot; Sherman-Palladino felt that the score elevated the series &quot;because it wasn&#x27;t a wasted element in the show. Everything was trying to say a little something, add a little something to it.&quot; Several of Phillips&#x27; album tracks are also played in the show, and she made an appearance in the season six finale &quot;Partings&quot;, performing part of &quot;Taking Pictures&quot;.

The theme song is a version of Carole King&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;Where You Lead&quot;. King made a new recording specially for &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;: a duet with her daughter Louise Goffin. She was happy that it gave the song &quot;a deeper meaning of love between a mother and her child&quot;. King appeared in several episodes as Sophie, the town music shop owner, and performed a brief portion of her song &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; in the revival.

Music also plays a large part in the show as a frequent topic of conversation between characters and in live performances within scenes and at the end of episodes. Musical acts who made appearances include The Bangles, Sonic Youth, Sparks, and the Shins. Grant-Lee Phillips appears in at least one episode per season as the town&#x27;s troubadour, singing his own songs and covers. In 2002, a soundtrack to &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; was released by Rhino Records, entitled &quot;Our Little Corner of the World: Music from Gilmore Girls&quot;. The CD booklet features anecdotes from show producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino about the large part music has played in their lives.

=== Change of showrunner ===

In 2006, the WB merged with UPN to form a new network, The CW. &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; survived the merger, being selected as one of seven WB shows to be transferred for a new season, but it resulted in a significant change. In April that year, it was announced that Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband Daniel Palladino could not come to an agreement with The CW and would be leaving the show when their contracts expired that summer. Journalist Michael Ausiello said of the decision: &quot;The thought of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; heading into what is likely to be its final season (and its first on a brand-new network) without its mama or her right-hand man is unfathomable.&quot; Discussing the departure later, Sherman-Palladino reflected on the contract dispute in an interview with &quot;Vulture&quot;, saying:

David S. Rosenthal, who worked on the show as a writer and producer for season 6, was selected by Sherman-Palladino to replace her as showrunner. Commenting on this change, an article in &quot;Wired&quot; says: &quot;the Palladinos had written the majority of the episodes up to that point, and their distinctive rhythms and obsessions were what defined &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. What remains after their departure is something that seems like &quot;Gilmore Girls Adjacent&quot; more than anything.&quot;

===Cancellation===
There was speculation during the seventh season that it would be the show&#x27;s final year, as Graham and Bledel&#x27;s contracts were both coming to an end. As negotiations continued between the actresses and the network, Rosenthal planned a finale that &quot;could serve as an ending or a beginning of a new chapter and a new season&quot;. Graham later said that by the end of the filming schedule &quot;there was a 50/50 chance we&#x27;d be returning&quot;, and she requested that the finale provide &quot;an opportunity to say goodbye&quot; to the characters, in case of cancellation. Due to the uncertainty, the cast and crew did not have a final wrap party or an opportunity to say farewells.

The CW initially considered bringing the show back for a shortened, 13-episode season but then decided against the idea. On May 3, 2007, shortly before the final episode aired, the network announced that the series would not be renewed. Graham explained that the possibility of returning fell through because &quot;We were trying to find a way we [she and Bledel] could have a slightly easier schedule, and there was really no way to do that and still have it be &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.&quot;

=== Revival ===
Because the final season was not written by the series creator, and the new writers had not known that the finale was definitely the last episode, Lauren Graham noted that a lot of fans &quot;were disappointed with how it [the series] ended&quot;. In 2009, Amy Sherman-Palladino expressed an interest in pursuing a &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; film, to finish the series as she originally intended. Over the following years, fans and journalists continued to ask regularly if the show would return. Privately, Sherman-Palladino stayed in contact with Graham, Bledel, Patterson, and Bishop to discuss the possibility, but nothing came to fruition.

In June 2015, for the 15th anniversary of the show, the cast and showrunners reunited for a special panel at the ATX Television Festival. When asked about a possible revival, Sherman-Palladino told the audience &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, there&#x27;s nothing in the works at the moment.&quot; The hype generated by the reunion, however, empowered Sherman-Palladino to pitch new episodes and encouraged Netflix to produce them. In October 2015 – eight years after the show had ended – TVLine reported that the streaming channel struck a deal with Warner Bros to revive the series in a limited run, consisting of four 90-minute episodes, written and directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino. The Palladinos explained that it felt like the right time creatively to continue the story, and that the freedom provided by Netflix made it possible.

The revival miniseries, titled &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;, was filmed from February to May 2016. Aside from Edward Herrmann, who died two years prior, every cast member who received a main credit on the show returned for at least a scene, while many supporting characters also made an appearance. The sets all had to be rebuilt from scratch, using nothing but photos and footage from the original series. The revival was released on Netflix on November 25, 2016, to positive reviews. There is speculation regarding a possible second revival, with Netflix reportedly keen.

== Broadcast history ==
&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;″ first season commenced on The WB in the Thursday 8pm/7pm Central time slot, as a lead-in for &quot;Charmed&quot;. Renewed for a second season, the show was relocated on Tuesdays 8pm/7pm, the time slot of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, which transferred to UPN, and served as a lead-in for &quot;Smallville&quot;, which became an instant hit and always beat &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; in the ratings. During seasons 4 and 5, it led into &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, which slowly became a hit. In season 6, it led into &quot;Supernatural&quot;, which became another hit for The WB and continued on until 2020. Both series were led by former &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; actors, with &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; starring Chad Michael Murray, and Jared Padalecki as a co-star in &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

First-season reruns aired on Monday nights from March 5 until April 9, 2001, during a mid-season hiatus of &quot;Roswell&quot;, to build audience awareness of the series. An additional run of the first season aired in 2002 on Sunday nights under the title &quot;Gilmore Girls Beginnings&quot; (which featured a modified opening sequence voiced with a monologue detailing the premise from Graham), and was one of two shows on The WB to have &quot;Beginnings&quot; in its title for reruns, along with &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

===Syndication===

In the US, the show began its syndicated release on ABC Family in 2004. The network continued to air the show daily under its new name Freeform until the fall of 2018, when those rights moved to Pop. In October 2015, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; began running on Up TV, which continues to air it to this day. Josef Adalian of &quot;Vulture&quot; commented on the rarity of Freeform and Up TV carrying a series of its type in syndication: &quot;not that many non-procedural, hour-long shows from the early part of the century—particularly those from a small network such as WB—are still even airing regularly on one cable network, let alone two.&quot; Up TV showed &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; 1,100 times in its first year; Freeform aired it 400 times in the same period.

From 2009 to 2013, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; also aired in weekend timeslots on SOAPnet. The series began running on Logo TV in August 2020. Since 2016, UP TV has aired a weeklong marathon of all episodes of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; around the Thanksgiving holiday. As the network maintains a family-friendly focus and programming schedule, some minor dialogue edits are made in a number of episodes, mainly when &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;damn&quot; are said, though all episodes are carried.

In the UK, the series premiered on Nickelodeon in 2003. Only the first three seasons were shown, with episodes edited for content, and some, like &quot;The Big One&quot;, dropped entirely. The series was subsequently picked up by the Hallmark Channel, which gave UK premieres to seasons four and five. It was rerun in its entirety on E4 until January 2012. The show moved to 5Star, then in 2018 changed to daily screenings on the Paramount Network.

In Ireland, the series aired its entire run on RTÉ One on Sundays, before moving to TG4. In Australia, from 16 March 2015, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; began airing again at weeknights on digital terrestrial network GEM and in 2024, reruns of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; repeats episodes airing from Saturday afternoons at 4:00 pm on the Nine Network and 9Now.

===Home media and online===
Warner Home Video released all seven seasons of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; on DVD, in regions 1, 2 and 4, mainly in full-screen 4:3 ratio due to Amy Sherman-Palladino&#x27;s preference at the time of original release. The full series DVD boxset was released in 2007. Special features include deleted scenes, three behind-the-scenes featurettes, cast interviews, montages, and one episode commentary (for &quot;You Jump, I Jump, Jack&quot;).

On October 1, 2014, all seven seasons of the series began streaming on Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Watch Instantly&quot; service in the United States; all episodes, including the three seasons before The WB transitioned the series to 16:9 HD broadcast from season four on, are in that format. On July 1, 2016, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; became available on Netflix worldwide. All seasons of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; are also available for digital download on the iTunes Store, Amazon.com and other digital sales websites, with all digital sites offering all episodes in HD.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; premiered to critical acclaim. Upon debut, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; was lauded for the distinct, dialogue-infused style created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, the strength of the dynamic familial themes, and the performances of its cast, particularly leading star Lauren Graham. On Metacritic, the first season has an average rating of 81 out of 100 from 26 reviews, indicating &quot;universal praise&quot;.

In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, John Carman wrote &quot;It&#x27;s cross-generational, warm-the-cockles viewing, and it&#x27;s a terrific show. Can this really be the WB, niche broadcaster to horny mall rats?&quot; Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;witty, charming show&quot; that &quot;is redefining family in a realistic, entertaining way for today&#x27;s audience, all the while avoiding the sappiness that makes sophisticated viewers run from anything labeled a &#x27;family show. Ray Richmond of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; declared it &quot;a genuine gem in the making, a family-friendly hour unburdened by trite cliche or precocious pablum,&quot; while Jonathan Storm of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; dubbed it &quot;a touching, funny, lively show that really does appeal to all ages&quot;. David Zurawik of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; called &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; &quot;One of the most pleasant surprises of the new season&quot;.

For the second-season premiere, Hal Boedeker of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; praised the show as &quot;one of television&#x27;s great, unsung pleasures&quot;, and said &quot;Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino writes clever dialogue and ingratiating comedy, but she also knows how to do bittersweet drama.&quot; Emily Yahr of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; retrospectively called the second installment &quot;Pretty much a perfect season of television&quot;. Viewers were concerned that the show would suffer when Rory left for college after season 3, and Yahr commented that the show was not &quot;the same&quot; from this point but gave seasons four and five a positive 7/10.

The last two seasons were less positively received. Maureen Ryan of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the sixth season as &quot;uneven at best&quot;, explaining, &quot;the protracted fight between Lorelai and Rory Gilmore left the writers scrambling to cram the show with filler plots that stretched many fans&#x27; patience to the limit.&quot; The introduction of Luke&#x27;s daughter has been described as &quot;pretty much the most hated plot device in &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; history&quot;. Ken Tucker from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the seventh season &quot;C&quot;, describing it as &quot;a death-blow season [which] was more accurately &quot;Gilmore Ghosts&quot;, as the exhausted actors bumped into the furniture searching for their departed souls and smart punchlines&quot;. But he concluded that before this came &quot;six seasons of magnificent mixed emotions&quot; among a &quot;perfect television idyll&quot;. Giving the show an overall rating of &quot;A−&quot;, he added, &quot;industry ignorance of the writing and of Graham&#x27;s performance in particular will remain an eternal scandal&quot;.

&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;All-Time 100 TV Shows&quot;. and was ranked the 87th greatest American television series in &quot;TV (The Book)&quot;, authored by critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz in 2016. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; 32nd on its &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list, and included the show on its end-of-the-2000s &quot;best-of&quot; list, and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; named &quot;They Shoot Gilmores, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; as one of the best TV episodes of the decade. Alan Sepinwall included the show in his &quot;Best of the 00s in Comedies&quot; list, saying: &quot;&quot;Gilmore&quot; offered up an unconventional but enormously appealing family ... As the quippy, pop culture-quoting younger Gilmores were forced to reconnect with their repressed elders, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino got plenty of laughs and tears out of the generational divide, and out of showing the family Lorelai created for herself and her daughter in the idealized, Norman Rockwell-esque town of Stars Hollow. At its best, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; was pure, concentrated happiness.&quot;

In 2016, Amy Plitt of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reflected on the enduring appeal of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, and noted that it stood out from other family shows like &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot; and &quot;Everwood&quot; by being &quot;far richer, deeper ... The characters were funny and relatable, the banter was zinger-heavy, the familial drama was poignant and the romantic chemistry ... was off the charts.&quot;

=== Television ratings ===
Viewer ratings for &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; were not relatively large, but the numbers were a success for the smaller WB network and it became one of their flagship series. For its first season the show aired in the tough Thursday 8pm/7pm Central time slot dominated by &quot;Friends&quot; on NBC and &quot;Survivor&quot; on CBS. Critical acclaim encouraged the network to move it to Tuesday evenings, as part of a push to promote the series and due to the move of Tuesday stalwart &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; to UPN in the same timeslot. During season 2, ratings for &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; surpassed &quot;Buffy&quot; and it became The WB&#x27;s third-highest-rated show, with viewer numbers that grew by double digits in all major demographics. For seasons 4–7, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; was up against the US&#x27;s top-rated show &quot;American Idol&quot;, which led to a drop in viewers, but with Season 5 it became The WB&#x27;s second-most-watched prime time show. The series was often in the top 3 most-viewed shows in its timeslot for women under 35.

In its 2016 syndicated release, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; averaged 100,000–120,000 viewers per episode, for an annual viewership of 11 million on each of its networks. The same year, the chief content officer for Netflix, Ted Sarandos, cited &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as one of the streaming channel&#x27;s most watched shows worldwide.

=== Awards and nominations ===

&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; earned several accolades, but did not receive much attention from the major awarding bodies. Its only Emmy nomination was for Outstanding Makeup for a Series, for the episode &quot;The Festival of Living Art&quot;, which it won at the 56th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2004. Michael Ausiello has attributed this to &quot;a notorious bias against the WB&quot;. Recognition did come from the American Film Institute, who named &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; one of the ten best shows at the American Film Institute Awards of 2002, and the Television Critics Association (TCA) who named it Outstanding New Program of the Year at the 17th TCA Awards in 2001. The TCA Awards also nominated the show for Outstanding Drama in 2001 and at the 18th TCA Awards in 2002, and Outstanding Comedy at the 21st TCA Awards in 2005. The Satellite Awards nominated it for Best Series – Musical or Comedy at the 7th Golden Satellite Awards in 2002 and the 9th Golden Satellite Awards in 2004, while it was nominated for Favorite Television Drama at the 31st People&#x27;s Choice Awards in 2005. The show was honored by the Viewers for Quality Television with a &quot;seal of quality&quot; in 2000. The series also achieved considerable attention from the Teen Choice Awards, where it received multiple nominations and wins including the award for Choice Comedy Series at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards.

Lauren Graham was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama at the 59th Golden Globe Awards and twice for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series for her work on the first and second seasons, and received five successive nominations for the Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. The TCAs nominated her for Individual Achievement in Drama in 2002, then for Comedy at the 22nd TCA Awards in 2006. She also received a Family Television Award, and she won the Teen Choice Award for Parental Unit three times. Alexis Bledel won a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Drama Series: Leading Young Actress at the 22nd Young Artist Awards, two Teen Choice Awards for Choice TV Actress Comedy, and a Family Television Award. She was also nominated by the Satellite Awards in 2002. Kelly Bishop was twice nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Television Series in 2002 and 2004.

===Fandom and cultural impact===

&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; is considered a cult classic, with an &quot;avid following&quot;. During the run of the show this was mostly a small but dedicated group, predominantly of females, but its audience has grown steadily since it came off the air. The series experienced a resurgence when it became available on Netflix in October 2014, introducing it to a new generation of viewers. When the revival was announced in 2015, star Lauren Graham credited it to the campaigning and persistence of the fans. At this point, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the show became &quot;a quirky pop culture obsession&quot;. The enduring popularity of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; is considered to come from its comforting quality and cross-generational appeal. It is particularly known as a show that mothers and daughters watch together.

The Gilmore Girls Fan Fest has become an annual event since its inauguration in 2016. The unofficial festival takes place in Connecticut over an October weekend, and includes panels with cast and crew, themed activities, and screenings. For the 16th anniversary of the show, 200 coffee houses around the US and Canada were transformed into &quot;Luke&#x27;s Diners&quot;. For two weeks in winter 2018–19, Warner Bros. added a special feature to their studio tour that recreated the Stars Hollow set and displayed props and costumes from the series. The show has an active fandom, posting in internet forums and creating work such as fan fiction. Special &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; trivia nights have been held at venues in multiple different cities. Actor from the show, Scott Patterson, who played Luke started his coffee brand which features blends themed after the show. His brand, &quot;Scotty P&#x27;s Big Mug Coffee,&quot; sells blends themed after places in the show, such as &quot;Luke&#x27;s&quot; blend, named after Patterson&#x27;s character&#x27;s diner. These coffees can be found on the Warner Bros website and in person at the Warner Bros Studio Tours, allowing fans to feel like they&#x27;re actually visiting Luke&#x27;s during the tour. 
The &quot;Irish Independent&quot; has commented that &quot;Even though it preceded social media, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; has been internet gold for the past few years. Thanks to its snappy one-liners, it&#x27;s spawned thousands of memes that have introduced the BuzzFeed generation to its coffee-swilling, cheeseburger-loving, critically-thinking characters.&quot; The show has been parodied on &quot;Mad TV&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and featured in an episode of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;. A cocktail bar in Brooklyn devised a menu inspired by the show. Warner Bros. has produced a range of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; merchandise, including T-shirts, mugs, and dolls.

Three collections of academic essays that analyze the show have been published: &quot;Gilmore Girls and the Politics of Identity&quot; (2008); &quot;Screwball Television: Critical Perspectives on Gilmore Girls&quot; (2010); and &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Cultural History&quot; (2019). In 2002, four young adult novels were published that adapted scripts from the first and second seasons into novel form, told from Rory&#x27;s first-person point of view. There have also been several unofficial, fan-based guides to the series, including &quot;Coffee At Luke&#x27;s: An Unauthorized Gilmore Girls Gab Fest&quot; (2007), &quot;The Gilmore Girls Companion&quot; (2010), &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Gilmored!: The Unofficial Encyclopedia and Complete Guide to Gilmore Girls&quot; (2020), and &quot;But I&#x27;m a Gilmore!: Stories and Experiences of Honorary Gilmore Girls: Cast, Crew, and Fans&quot; The program is also the source of a book club, in which followers aim to read all 339 books referenced on the show, and the inspiration for a cookbook called &quot;Eat Like a Gilmore&quot;.

&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; is the basis for the successful podcast &quot;Gilmore Guys&quot; (2014–2017), which was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 50 best podcasts of 2017 – the only television-based inclusion. It follows the hosts, Kevin T. Porter and Demi Adejuyigbe, as they watch every episode of the series. Sadaf Ahsan of the &quot;National Post&quot; commented that it &quot;helped reignite – and, for some, initiate – fan fervour&quot; towards &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.

At the Eurovision Song Contest 2024, comedian and host Petra Mede offered a DVD of Season 3 of the &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as a bonus prize to complement the winner&#x27;s trophy.

<doc id="376979" wikidata="Q693036" url="?curid=376979" title="Yamanote Line">
<text>The Yamanote Line () is a railway loop service in Tokyo, Japan, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East). It is one of Tokyo&#x27;s busiest and most important lines, connecting most of Tokyo&#x27;s major stations and urban centres, including Marunouchi, the Yūrakuchō/Ginza area, Shinagawa, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, and Ueno, with all but two of its 30 stations connecting to other railway or underground (subway) lines.

Internally JR East refers to the &quot;Yamanote Line&quot; as the quadruple-track corridor between Shinagawa and Tabata via Shinjuku. The corridor consists of a pair of tracks used by Yamanote local trains and another parallel pair of tracks called &quot;the Yamanote Freight Line&quot; used by the Saikyō and Shōnan-Shinjuku line trains, some limited express services, and freight trains. In everyday usage, branding on maps and station signage, the &quot;Yamanote Line&quot; refers to the local service (also called &quot;system&quot;) running the entire line looping between the Yamanote corridor via Shinjuku Station and the central portions of the Tōhoku and Tōkaidō Main Lines Via Tokyo Station. (This article uses the same definition unless noted otherwise.)

==Service outline==
Trains run from 04:26 to 01:04 the next day at intervals as short as 2 minutes during peak periods and four minutes at other times. A complete loop takes 59 to 65 minutes. All trains stop at each station. Trains are put into and taken out of service at (which for timetabling purposes is the line&#x27;s start and terminus) and sometimes . Certain trains also start from Tamachi in the mornings and end at in the evenings. Trains which run clockwise are known as and those counter-clockwise as . (Trains travel on the left in Japan, as with road traffic.)

The line also acts as a fare zone destination for JR tickets from locations outside Tokyo, permitting travel to any JR station on or within the loop. This refers to stations on the Yamanote Line as well as the Chūō-Sōbu and Chūō Rapid Lines and between and .

The Yamanote Line colour used on all rolling stock, station signs and diagrams is JNR Yellow Green No.6 (■, Munsell code 7.5GY 6.5/7.8), known in Japanese as .

== Ridership and overcrowding ==
Due to the Yamanote Line&#x27;s central location connecting most of Tokyo&#x27;s major commuter hubs and commercial areas, the line is very heavily used. Sections of the line were running over 250% capacity in the 1990s, and remained above 200% for most of the 2000s with most sections dropping below 150% in 2018. This is due to larger and more frequent trains being introduced to the Yamanote Line and the opening of parallel relief lines such as the Tokyo Metro and Ueno–Tokyo Line. The maximum overcrowding during rush hour is about 158%.

The ridership intensity of the Yamanote Line in 2018 was 1,134,963 passengers - km / km of route. The daily ridership of the Yamanote Line estimated in a 2015 MLIT National Transit census was about 4 million people per day. However, in both cases &quot;Yamanote Line&quot; refers to JR East&#x27;s internal definition of the entire rail corridor between Shinagawa and Tabata stations via Shinjuku which includes the ridership of the Saikyō and Shōnan–Shinjuku Lines on the parallel Yamanote freight line. Meanwhile, the ridership of the Yamanote Line services between Tabata and Shinagawa Station via Tokyo are excluded and counted as part of the Tōhoku and Tōkaidō Main Lines.

== Name ==
&quot;Yamanote&quot; literally refers to inland, hillier districts or foothills (as distinct from areas close to the sea). In Tokyo, &quot;Yamanote&quot; lies along the western side of the Yamanote Line loop. The word consists of the Japanese morphemes &quot;yama&quot;, meaning &#x27;mountain&#x27;, the genitive suffix &quot;no&quot;, and &quot;te&quot;, meaning &#x27;hand&#x27;, thus literally translating as &quot;mountain&#x27;s hand&quot;, analogous to the English term &quot;foothills&quot;. &quot;Yamanote-sen&quot; is officially written in Japanese without the &quot;kana&quot; , which makes its pronunciation ambiguous in print. The characters may also be pronounced &quot;yamate&quot;, as in Yamate-dōri (Yamate Street), which runs parallel to the west side of the Yamanote Line. The Seishin-Yamate Line in Kobe and the Yamate area of Yokohama also use this pronunciation. After World War II, SCAP ordered all train placards to be romanized, and the Yamanote Line was romanized as &quot;Yamate Line&quot; due to a mistake made by one of the workers at JNR. It was thus alternatively known as &quot;Yamanote&quot; and &quot;Yamate&quot; until 1971, when the Japanese National Railways changed the pronunciation back to &quot;Yamanote&quot;, as people started riding trains heading for Yamate thinking it goes to the Yamate Station located in Yokohama. Some older people still refer to the line as the &quot;Yamate Line&quot;.

==Rolling stock==

, the line&#x27;s services are operated exclusively by a fleet of 50 11-car E235 series EMUs, the first of which was introduced on the line on 30 November 2015. However, a number of technical faults, including problems with door close indicators, resulted in the train being taken out of service the same day. The E235 series returned to service on the Yamanote Line on 7 March 2016. All Yamanote Line rolling stock are stored and maintained at near Ōsaki Station.

===Former rolling stock===
Prior to the E235 series, the line&#x27;s services were operated by E231-500 series EMUs, which were in use from April 21, 2002 to January 20, 2020. These trains originally each included two &quot;six-door cars&quot; with six pairs of doors per side and bench seats that were folded up to provide standing room only during the morning peak until 10 a.m. From February 22, 2010, the seats were no longer folded up during the morning peak, and all trains were standardized with newly built four-door cars by 31 August 2011. This was due to reduced congestion on the line as well as preparation for the installation of platform doors on all stations by 2017.

The E231 series supported a new type of traffic control system, called digital Automatic Train Control (D-ATC). The series also had a more modern design and has two 15-inch LCD monitors above each door, one of which is used for displaying silent commercials, news and weather; and another which is used for displaying information on the next stop (in Japanese, English, Korean and more) along with notification of delays on Shinkansen and other railway lines in the greater Tokyo area.

===Timeline===
==History==
The predecessor of the present-day Yamanote Line was opened on 1 March 1885 by the Nippon Railway Company, operating between Shinagawa Station in the south and Akabane Station in the north. The top part of the loop between and (a distance of ) opened on 1 April 1903, and both lines were merged to become the Yamanote Line on 12 October 1909.

The line was electrified on December 16, 1909, soon after the Osaki – Shinagawa section was double-tracked on November 30. The loop was completed in 1925 with the opening of the double track, electrified section between and on 1 November, providing a north–south link via Tokyo Station through the city&#x27;s business centre. A parallel freight line, also completed in 1925, ran along the inner side of the loop between Shinagawa and Tabata.

During the prewar era, the Ministry of Railways did not issue permits to private suburban railway companies for new lines to cross the Yamanote Line from their terminal stations to the central districts of Tokyo, forcing the companies to terminate services at stations on the line. This policy led to the development of around major transfer points on the Yamanote Line, most notably at and (which are now the two busiest passenger railway stations in the world).

The contemporary Yamanote Line came into being on 19 November 1956 when it was separated from the Keihin-Tōhoku Line and given its own set of tracks along the eastern side of the loop between Shinagawa and . However, Yamanote Line trains continued to periodically use the Keihin-Tōhoku tracks, particularly on holidays and during off-peak hours, until rapid service trains were introduced on the Keihin-Tōhoku Line in 1988.

A major explosion on the Yamanote Freight Line in Shinjuku in 1967 led to the diversion of freight traffic to the more distant Musashino Line. To address severe undercapacity, the freight line was repurposed for use by Saikyō Line and Shōnan-Shinjuku Line trains, as well as certain limited express trains such as the &quot;Narita Express&quot; and some liner services. Likewise, from 14 March 2015 onwards, the Ueno-Tokyo Line starts services, which connects the Tōhoku Main Line and Jōban Line to the Tōkaidō Main Line, to provide further relief on the busiest portion of the Yamanote Line today, the segment between Ueno and Tokyo stations.

Automatic train control (ATC) was introduced from 6 December 1981, and digital ATC (D-ATC) was introduced from 30 July 2006.

Station numbering was introduced on JR East stations in the Tokyo area from 20 August 2016, with Yamanote Line stations numbered using the prefix &quot;JY&quot;.

A new station, Takanawa Gateway Station, opened on 14 March 2020. This station was built on the Yamanote Line and Keihin-Tohoku Line between Shinagawa and Tamachi stations, becoming the first new station on the line since Nishi-Nippori was built in 1971. The distance between Shinagawa and Tamachi stations was , making it the longest stretch of track between stations on the Yamanote Line. The new station was constructed on top of the 20-hectare former railyard, which is undergoing rationalization and redevelopment by JR East; it is roughly parallel to the existing Sengakuji Station on the Toei Asakusa and Keikyu Main lines. The Yamanote Line and the Keihin-Tohoku Line tracks were moved slightly to the east to be aligned closer to the Tokaido Shinkansen tracks. The area on the west side of the yard made available will be redeveloped with high-rise office buildings, creating an international business center with good connections to the Shinkansen and Haneda Airport.

In October 2022 JR East began performing trial runs for driverless trains on the line aimed to begin sometime in 2028. Two sets, 17 and 18, were fitted with the new system and re-entered service on the line as train crew conduct ongoing tests on their performance. Furthermore, the two sets are easy to distinguish with an “ATO” (Automatic Train Operation) sticker located on the front and sides of each set. Once ATO is fully installed, this will be the first line of JR East to feature driverless trains.

<doc id="376985" wikidata="Q219355" url="?curid=376985" title="Roswell incident">
<text>The Roswell incident is the subject of a conspiracy theory which alleges that United States Army Air Forces balloon debris recovered in 1947 near Roswell, New Mexico, was actually a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft. Operated from the nearby Alamogordo Army Air Field and part of the top secret Project Mogul, the balloon was intended to detect Soviet nuclear tests. After metallic and rubber debris were recovered by Roswell Army Air Field personnel, the United States Army announced their possession of a &quot;flying disc&quot;. This announcement made international headlines, but was retracted within a day. To obscure the purpose and source of the debris, the army reported that it was a conventional weather balloon.

In 1978, retired Air Force officer Jesse Marcel revealed that the army&#x27;s weather balloon claim had been a cover story, and speculated that the debris was of extraterrestrial origin. Popularized by the 1980 book &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot;, this speculation became the basis for long-lasting and increasingly complex and contradictory UFO conspiracy theories, which over time expanded the incident to include governments concealing evidence of extraterrestrial beings, grey aliens, multiple crashed flying saucers, alien corpses and autopsies, and the reverse engineering of extraterrestrial technology, none of which have any factual basis.

In the 1990s, the United States Air Force published multiple reports which established that the incident was related to Project Mogul, and not debris from a UFO. Despite this, many UFO proponents still claim that the Roswell debris was in fact derived from an alien craft, and accuse the US government of a cover-up. The conspiracy narrative has become a trope in science fiction literature, film, and television. The town of Roswell promotes itself as a destination for UFO-associated tourism.
==1947 military balloon crash==
By 1947, the United States had launched thousands of top-secret Project Mogul balloons carrying devices to listen for Soviet atomic tests. On June 4, researchers at Alamogordo Army Air Field in New Mexico launched a long train of these balloons; they lost contact with the balloons and balloon-borne equipment within of W.W. &quot;Mac&quot; Brazel&#x27;s ranch near Corona, New Mexico, where a balloon subsequently crashed. Later that month, Brazel discovered tinfoil, rubber, tape, and thin wooden beams scattered across several acres of his ranch. 

With no phone or radio, Brazel was initially unaware of the ongoing flying disc craze. Amid the first summer of the Cold War, press nationwide covered Kenneth Arnold&#x27;s account of what became known as flying saucers, objects that allegedly performed maneuvers beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. Coverage of Arnold&#x27;s report preceded a wave of over 800 similar sightings. When Brazel visited Corona, on July 5, his uncle Hollis Wilson suggested his debris could be from a &quot;flying disk&quot;. Hundreds of reports had been made during the Fourth of July weekend, newspapers speculated on a possible Soviet origin, and about $3,000 () was offered for physical proof.

The next day Brazel drove to Roswell, New Mexico, and informed Sheriff George Wilcox of the debris he had found. Wilcox called Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). RAAF was home to the 509th Bomb group of the Eighth Air Force, the only unit at the time capable of delivering nuclear weapons. The base assigned Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt to return with Brazel and gather the material from the ranch. RAAF Base commander Colonel William Blanchard notified the Eighth Air Force commanding officer Roger M. Ramey of their findings.

On July 8, RAAF public information officer Walter Haut issued a press release stating that the military had recovered a &quot;flying disc&quot; near Roswell. Robert Porter, an RAAF flight engineer, was part of the crew who loaded what he was &quot;told was a flying saucer&quot; onto the flight bound for Fort Worth Army Air Field in Texas. He described the materialpackaged in wrapping paper when he received itas lightweight and not too large to fit inside the trunk of a car. After station director George Walsh broke the news over Roswell radio station KSWS and relayed it to the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, his phone lines were overwhelmed. He later recalled, &quot;All afternoon, I tried to call Sheriff Wilcox for more information, but could never get through to him [...] Media people called me from all over the world.&quot;


The press release issued by Haut read:

Media interest in the case dissipated soon after a press conference where General Roger Ramey, his chief of staff Colonel Thomas DuBose, and weather officer Irving Newton identified the material as pieces of a weather balloon. Newton told reporters that similar radar targets were used at about 80 weather stations across the country. The small number of subsequent news stories offered mundane and prosaic accounts of the crash. On July 9, the &quot;Roswell Daily Record&quot; highlighted that no engine or metal parts had been found in the wreckage. Brazel told the &quot;Record&quot; that the debris consisted of rubber strips, &quot;tinfoil, paper, tape, and sticks.&quot; Brazel said he paid little attention to it but returned later with his wife and daughter to gather up some of the debris. Despite later claims that he was forced to repeat a cover story, Brazel told newspaper reporters, &quot;I am sure that what I found was not any weather observation balloon.&quot; When interviewed in Fort Worth, Texas, Jesse Marcel described the wreckage as &quot;parts of the weather device&quot; composed of &quot;tinfoil and broken wooden beams&quot;.

A portion of the material was flown from Texas to Wright Field in Ohio, where Colonel Marcellus Duffy identified it as balloon equipment. Duffy had previous experience with Project Mogul and contacted Mogul&#x27;s project officer Albert Trakowski to discuss the debris. Unable to disclose details about the project, Duffy identified it as &quot;meteorological equipment&quot;.

The 1947 official account omitted any connection to Cold War military programs. On July 10, military personnel at Alamogordo gave a demonstration to the press. Four officers provided a false account of mundane weather balloon usage throughout the previous year. They demonstrated balloon configurations used by the Mogul team as ways to gather meteorological data, offering a plausible explanation for any unusual aspects of the Roswell debris. The Air Force later described the weather balloon story as &quot;an attempt to deflect attention from the top secret Mogul project.&quot;

==UFO conspiracy theories (1947–1978)==
The 1947 debris retrieval remained relatively obscure for three decades. Reporting ceased soon after the government provided a mundane explanation, and broader reporting on flying saucers declined rapidly after the Twin Falls saucer hoax. Just days after stories of the Roswell &quot;flying disc&quot;, a widely reported crashed disc from Twin Falls, Idaho, was found to be a hoax created by four teenagers using parts from a jukebox.

Nevertheless, belief in UFO cover-ups by the US government became widespread in this period. Hoaxes, legends, and stories of crashed spaceships and alien bodies in New Mexico emerged that later formed elements of the Roswell myth. In 1947, many Americans attributed flying saucers to unknown military aircraft. In the decades between the initial debris recovery and the emergence of Roswell theories, flying saucers became synonymous with alien spacecraft. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the Watergate scandal, trust in the US government declined and acceptance of conspiracy theories became widespread. UFO believers accused the government of a &quot;Cosmic Watergate&quot;. The 1947 incident was reinterpreted to fit the public&#x27;s increasingly conspiracy-minded outlook.

===Aztec crashed saucer hoax===

The Aztec, New Mexico crashed saucer hoax in 1948 introduced stories of recovered alien bodies that later became associated with Roswell. It achieved broad exposure when the con artists behind it convinced &quot;Variety&quot; columnist Frank Scully to cover their fictitious crash. The hoax narrative included small grey humanoid bodies, metal stronger than any found on Earth, indecipherable writing, and a government coverup to prevent public panicthese elements appeared in later versions of the Roswell myth. In retellings, the mundane debris reported at the actual crash site was replaced with the Aztec hoax&#x27;s fantastical alloys. By the time Roswell returned to media attention, grey aliens had become a part of American culture through the Barney and Betty Hill incident. In a 1997 Roswell report, Air Force investigator James McAndrew wrote that &quot;even with the exposure of this obvious fraud, the Aztec story is still revered by UFO theorists. Elements of this story occasionally reemerge and are thought to be the catalyst for other crashed flying saucer stories, including the Roswell Incident.&quot;

===Hangar 18===
&quot;Hangar 18&quot; is a non-existent location that many later conspiracy theories allege housed extraterrestrial craft or bodies recovered from Roswell. The idea of alien corpses from a crashed ship being stored in an Air Force morgue at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was mentioned in Scully&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Flying Saucers&quot;, expanded in the 1966 book &quot;Incident at Exeter&quot;, and became the basis for a 1968 science-fiction novel &quot;The Fortec Conspiracy&quot;. &quot;Fortec&quot; was about a fictional cover-up by the Air Force unit charged with reverse-engineering other nations&#x27; technical advancements.

In 1974, science-fiction author and conspiracy theorist Robert Spencer Carr alleged that alien bodies recovered from the Aztec crash were stored in &quot;Hangar 18&quot; at Wright-Patterson. Carr claimed that his sources had witnessed the alien autopsy, another idea later incorporated into the Roswell narrative. The Air Force explained that no &quot;Hangar 18&quot; existed at the base, noting a similarity between Carr&#x27;s story and the fictional &quot;Fortec Conspiracy&quot;. The 1980 film &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, which dramatized Carr&#x27;s claims, was described as &quot;a modern-day dramatization&quot; of Roswell by the film&#x27;s director James L. Conway, and as &quot;nascent Roswell mythology&quot; by folklorist Thomas Bullard. Decades later, Carr&#x27;s son recalled that he had often &quot;mortified my mother and me by spinning preposterous stories in front of strangers... [tales of] befriending a giant alligator in the Florida swamps, and sharing complex philosophical ideas with porpoises in the Gulf of Mexico.&quot;

==Roswell conspiracy theories (1978–1994)==
Interest in Roswell was rekindled after ufologist Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel in 1978. Marcel had accompanied the Roswell debris from the ranch to the Fort Worth press conference. In the 1978 interview, Marcel stated that the &quot;weather balloon&quot; explanation from the press conference was a cover story, and that he now believed the debris was extraterrestrial. On December 19, 1979, Marcel was interviewed by Bob Pratt of the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, and the tabloid brought large-scale attention to the Marcel story the following February. Marcel described a foil that could be crumpled but would uncrumple when released. On September 20, 1980, the TV series &quot;In Search of...&quot;, hosted by Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy, aired an interview where Marcel described his participation in the 1947 press conference:

Ufologists interviewed Major Marcel&#x27;s son, Jesse A. Marcel Jr. M.D., who said that when he was 10 years old, his father had shown him flying saucer debris recovered from the Roswell crash site, including, &quot;a small beam with purple-hued hieroglyphics on it&quot;. However, the symbols described as alien hieroglyphics matched the symbols on the adhesive tape that Project Mogul sourced from a New York toy manufacturer.

To publish his research, Friedman collaborated with childhood friend and author William &quot;Bill&quot; Moore, who reached out to established paranormal author Charles Berlitz. Berlitz had previously written about the Bermuda Triangle and had collaborated with Moore to write about the Philadelphia Experiment. Crediting Friedman only as an investigator, Moore and Berlitz co-wrote the 1980 book &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot;. It popularized Marcel&#x27;s account and added the claimed discovery of alien bodies, found approximately 150 miles west of the original debris site on the Plains of San Agustin. Marcel never mentioned the presence of bodies.

Friedman, Berlitz, and Moore also connected Marcel&#x27;s account to an earlier statement by Lydia Sleppy, a former teletype operator at the KOAT radio station in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Sleppy claimed that she was typing a story about crashed saucer wreckage as dictated by reporter Johnny McBoyle until interrupted by an incoming message, ordering her to end communications. Between 1978 and the early 1990s, UFO researchers such as Friedman, Moore, and the team of Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmitt interviewed many people who claimed to have had a connection with the events at Roswell in 1947, generating competing and conflicting accounts.

===&quot;The Roswell Incident&quot;===

The first Roswell conspiracy book, released in October 1980, was &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot; by Charles Berlitz and Bill Moore. Anthropologist Charles Ziegler described the 1980 book as &quot;version 1&quot; of the Roswell myth. Berlitz and Moore&#x27;s narrative was the dominant version of the Roswell conspiracy during the 1980s.

The book argues that an extraterrestrial craft was flying over the New Mexico desert to observe nuclear weapons activity when a lightning strike killed the alien crew. It alleges that, after recovering the crashed alien technology, the US government engaged in a cover-up to prevent mass panic. &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot; quoted Marcel&#x27;s later description of the debris as &quot;nothing made on this earth&quot;. The book claims that in some photographs, the debris recovered by Marcel had been substituted with the debris from a weather device despite no visible differences in the photographed material. The book&#x27;s claims of unusual debris were contradicted by the mundane details provided by Captain Sheridan Cavitt, who had gathered the material with Marcel. &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot; introduced alien bodiesvia the second-hand legends of deceased civil engineer Grady &quot;Barney&quot; Barnettpurportedly found by archaeologists on the Plains of San Agustin.

The authors claimed to have interviewed over 90 witnesses, though the testimony of only 25 appears in the book. Only seven of them claimed to have seen the debris. Of these, five claimed to have handled it. Some elements of the witness accountssmall alien bodies, indestructible metals, hieroglyphic writingmatched other crashed saucer legends more than the 1947 reports from Roswell. Berlitz and Moore claimed Scully&#x27;s long-discredited crashed saucer hoax to be an account of the Roswell incident that mistakenly &quot;placed the area of the crash near Aztec&quot;. 

Mac Brazel died in 1963 before interest in the Roswell debris was revived. Berlitz and Moore interviewed his surviving adult children, William Brazel Jr. and Bessie Brazel Schreiber. Brazel Jr. described how the military arrested his father and &quot;swore him to secrecy&quot;. However, during the time that Mac Brazel was alleged to have been in military custody, multiple people reported seeing him in Roswell, and he provided an interview to local radio station KGFL. Schreiber, who had gathered debris material with her father when she was 14, offered ufologists a description that matched the materials used by Project Mogul, &quot;There was what appeared to be pieces of heavily waxed paper and a sort of aluminum-like foil. [...] Some of the metal-foil pieces had a sort of tape stuck to them, and when they were held up to the light they showed what looked like pastel flowers [...]&quot;.

According to the book, &quot;some of the most important testimony&quot; was given by Marcel, the former intelligence officer who had gathered the debris in 1947 and claimed to have been part of a cover-up. The broader UFO media treated Marcel as a whistleblower. Independent researchers found embellishment in Jesse Marcel&#x27;s accounts, including false statements about his military career and educational background.

===Majestic 12 hoax===

Majestic 12 was the purported organization behind faked government documents delivered anonymously to multiple ufologists in the 1980s. All individuals who received the fake documents were connected to Bill Moore. After the publication of &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot;, Richard C. Doty and other individuals presenting themselves as Air Force Intelligence Officers approached Moore. They used the unfulfilled promise of hard evidence of extraterrestrial retrievals to recruit Moore, who kept notes on other ufologists and intentionally spread misinformation within the UFO community. The earliest known reference to &quot;MJ Twelve&quot; comes from a 1981 document used in disinformation targeting Paul Bennewitz. In 1982, Bob Pratt worked with Doty and Moore on &quot;The Aquarius Project&quot;, an unpublished science fiction manuscript about the purported organization. Moore had initially planned to do a nonfiction book but lacked evidence. During a phone call about the manuscript, Moore explained to Pratt that his goal was to &quot;get as much of the story out with as little fiction as possible.&quot; That same year, Moore, Friedman, and Jaime Shandera began work on a KPIX-TV UFO documentary, and Moore shared the original &quot;MJ Twelve&quot; memo mentioning Bennewitz. KPIX-TV contacted the Air Force, who noted many style and formatting errors; Moore admitted that he had typed and stamped the document as a facsimile. On December 11, 1984, Shandera received the first anonymous package containing photographs of Majestic-12 documents just after a phone call from Moore. The anonymously-delivered documents detailed the creation of a likely fictitious Majestic 12 group formed to handle Roswell debris.

At a 1989 Mutual UFO Network conference, Moore confessed that he had intentionally fed fake evidence of extraterrestrials to UFO researchers, including Bennewitz. Doty later said that he gave fabricated information to UFO researchers while working at Kirtland Air Force Base in the 1980s. Roswell conspiracy proponents turned on Moore, but not the broader conspiracy theory.

The Majestic-12 materials have been heavily scrutinized and discredited. The various purported memos existed only as copies of photographs of documents. Carl Sagan criticized the complete lack of provenance of documents &quot;miraculously dropped on a doorstep like something out of a fairy story, perhaps &#x27;The Elves and the Shoemaker&#x27;.&quot; Researchers noted the idiosyncratic date format not found in government documents from the time they were purported to originate, but widely used in Moore&#x27;s personal notes. Some signatures appear to be photocopied from other documents. For example, a signature from President Harry Truman is identical to one from an October 1, 1947 letter to Vannevar Bush.

In this variant of the Roswell legend, the bodies were ejected from the craft shortly before it exploded over the ranch. The propulsion unit is destroyed and the government concludes the ship was a &quot;short range reconnaissance craft&quot;. The following week, the bodies are recovered some miles away, decomposing from exposure and scavengers.

===Role of Glenn Dennis===
The initial claims of recovered alien bodies came from the secondhand accounts of &quot;Barney&quot; Barnett and &quot;Pappy&quot; Henderson after their deaths. On August 5, 1989, Friedman interviewed former mortician Glenn Dennis. Dennis provided an account of extraterrestrial corpses endorsed by prominent Roswell ufologists Don Berliner, Friedman, Randle, and Schmitt. Dennis claimed to have received &quot;four or five calls&quot; from the Air Base with questions about body preservation and inquiries about small or hermetically sealed caskets; he further claimed that a local nurse told him she had witnessed an &quot;alien autopsy&quot;. Glenn Dennis has been called the &quot;star witness&quot; of the Roswell incident.

On September 20, 1989, an episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; included the second-hand stories of alien bodies captured by the army and transported to Texas. The episode was watched by 28 million people. In 1994, Dennis&#x27;s account was portrayed by &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; and dramatized in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Roswell&quot;. Dennis appeared in multiple books and documentaries. In 1991, Dennis co-founded a UFO museum in Roswell along with Max Littell and former RAAF public affairs officer Walter Haut.

Dennis provided false names for the nurse who allegedly witnessed the autopsy. Presented with evidence that a Naomi Self or Naomi Maria Selff had never worked as a military nurse in 1947, Dennis admitted to fabricating her name. He claimed the nurse&#x27;s actual name was Naomi Sipes. When no records were found for a Naomi Sipes, Dennis admitted to fabricating that name as well. UFO researcher Karl Pflock observed that Dennis&#x27;s story &quot;sounds like a B-grade thriller conceived by Oliver Stone.&quot; Scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning said that Dennis cannot be regarded as a reliable witness, considering that he had seemingly waited over 40 years before he started recounting a series of unconnected events. Such events, Dunning argues, were then arbitrarily joined to form what has become the most popular narrative of the alleged alien crash. Prominent UFO researchers, including Pflock and Randle, have become convinced that no bodies were recovered from the Roswell crash.

===Competing accounts and schism===
A proliferation of competing Roswell accounts led to a schism among ufologists in the early 1990s. The two leading UFO societies disagreed on the scenarios presented by Randle–Schmitt and Friedman–Berliner. One issue was the location of Barnett&#x27;s account. A 1992 UFO conference attempted to achieve a consensus among the various scenarios portrayed in &quot;Crash at Corona&quot; and &quot;UFO Crash at Roswell&quot;. The 1994 publication of &quot;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&quot; addressed the Barnett problem by simply ignoring the Barnett story. It proposed a new location for the alien craft recovery and a different group of archaeologists.

====&quot;UFO Crash at Roswell&quot;====
In 1991, Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt published &quot;UFO Crash at Roswell&quot;. It sold 160,000 copies and served as the basis for the 1994 television film &quot;Roswell&quot;. Randle and Schmitt added testimony from 100 new witnesses. Though hundreds of people were interviewed by various researchers, only a few claimed to have seen debris or aliens. According to Pflock, of the 300-plus individuals reportedly interviewed for &quot;UFO Crash at Roswell&quot; (1991), only 23 could be &quot;reasonably thought to have seen physical evidence, debris&quot;. Of these, only seven asserted anything suggestive of otherworldly origins for the debris.

The book claimed that General Arthur Exon had been aware of debris and bodies, but Exon disputed his depiction. Glenn Dennis&#x27;s claims of an alien autopsy and Grady Barnett&#x27;s &quot;alien body&quot; accounts appeared in the book. However, the dates and locations of Barnett&#x27;s account in &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot; were changed without explanation. Brazel was described as leading the army to a second crash site on the ranch, where they were supposedly &quot;horrified to find civilians [including Barnett] there already.&quot; Also in 1991, retired US Air Force (USAF) Brigadier General Thomas DuBose, who had posed with debris for press photographs in 1947, acknowledged the &quot;weather balloon explanation for the material was a cover story to divert the attention of the press.&quot;

====&quot;Crash at Corona&quot;====
In 1992, Stanton Friedman released &quot;Crash at Corona&quot;, co-authored with Don Berliner. The book introduced new &quot;witnesses&quot; and added to the narrative by doubling the number of flying saucers to two, and the number of aliens to eighttwo of which were said to have survived and been taken into custody by the government. Friedman interviewed Lydia Sleppy, the teletype operator who years earlier had said that she was ordered not to transmit a crashed saucer story. Friedman attributed Sleppy&#x27;s account to FBI usage of an alleged nationwide surveillance system that he believed was put in place following &quot;an earlier crash&quot;. However, no evidence was found that the FBI had ever monitored any transmissions from her radio station. Friedman&#x27;s description of her typing as &quot;interrupted&quot; by an FBI message and Moore&#x27;s claim that &quot;the machine suddenly stopped itself&quot; were found to be impossible for the teletype model that Sleppy operated in 1947.

====&quot;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&quot;====
In 1994, Randle and Schmitt authored another book, &quot;The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell&quot; which claimed a cargo plane delivered alien bodies to Dwight D. Eisenhower. The book abandoned the Barnett crash site on the Plains of San Agustin as lacking evidence and contradicting its &quot;framework of the Roswell event&quot;. Randle and Schmitt proposed a new crash site 35 miles north of Roswell, based on statements from Jim Ragsdale and Frank Kaufman. The book hid Kaufman&#x27;s identity behind the pseudonym &quot;Steve MacKenzie&quot;, but Kaufman appeared in the 1995 British television documentary &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot; using his real name. Kaufman claimed he monitored a UFO&#x27;s path on radar and recovered debris from a crashed spaceship similar in shape to an F-117 stealth fighter. Kaufmann&#x27;s statements did not match the personnel at the base, his service record, the radar technology available, or the known topography of the proposed crashed site. Jim Ragsdale claimed that while driving home along Highway 285 with his girlfriend Trudy Truelove, they watched a craft that was &quot;narrow with a bat-like wing&quot; crash. A later interview with Ragsdale clarified that his alleged crash site was nowhere near either the purported Barnett or Kaufman sites. In further interviews, Ragsdale&#x27;s story grew to include bizarre details such as Ragsdale and Truelove removing eleven golden helmets from the alien craft to bury in the desert.

==Air Force response==

The Air Force provided official responses to Roswell conspiracy theories during the mid-1990s under pressure from New Mexico congressman Steven Schiff and the General Accounting Office (GAO). The initial 1994 USAF report admitted that the weather balloon explanation was a cover story for Project Mogul, a military surveillance program. Published the following year, &quot;The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert&quot; supported this with extensive documentation that narrowed the cause of the debris to a specific Mogul balloon train launched on June 4, 1947, and lost near the Roswell debris field. Within the UFO community, the Air Force reports were not accepted, and ufologists noted that the GAO probe found no Roswell documents at the CIA and no information about the alleged Majestic 12 group. Contemporary polls found that the majority of Americans doubted the Air Force explanation.

News media and skeptical researchers embraced the findings. Project Mogul offered a cohesive explanation for the contemporary accounts of the debrisfailing only to explain later conflicting additions. Carl Sagan and Phil Klass noted that aspects of the debris reported as anomalousincluding the abstract symbols and lightweight foilmatched the materials used by Project Mogul. Mogul also matched the materials of the hypothetical &quot;disc&quot; as described in a 1947 FBI telex from Fort Worth, Texas. The telex said that according to the Eighth Air Force, &quot;The disc is hexagonal in shape and was suspended from a balloon by cable, which balloon was approximately twenty feet (6 m) in diameter.&quot; In 1997, the Air Force published a second report, &quot;The Roswell Report: Case Closed&quot;. It detailed how eyewitness accounts of military personnel loading aliens into &quot;body bags&quot; matched the Air Force&#x27;s procedures for retrieving parachute test dummies in insulation bags, designed to shield temperature-sensitive equipment in the desert.

==Later theories and hoaxes (1994–present)==
===&quot;Alien Autopsy&quot;===

Pseudo-documentaries, most notably &quot;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&quot;, have taken a major role in shaping popular opinion of Roswell. In 1995, British entrepreneur Ray Santilli claimed to have footage of an alien autopsy filmed after the 1947 Roswell crash, purchased from an elderly Army Air Force cameraman. &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; centers around Santilli&#x27;s hoaxed footage, which it presents as a probable artifact of the government&#x27;s investigation into Roswell. The purported cameraman Barnett had died in 1967 without ever serving in the military, and visual effects expert Stan Winston told newspapers that &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; had misrepresented his conclusion that Santilli&#x27;s footage was an obvious fake. In a 2006 documentary, Santilli admitted that the footage was fabricated, filmed on a set built in a London living room.

Over twenty million viewers watched the purported autopsy. Fox aired the program immediately before and implicitly connected to the fictional &quot;X-Files&quot;, which later parodied the film. &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; established a template for future pseudo-documentaries built on questioning a presumed government cover-up. Though thoroughly debunked, core UFO believers, many of whom still accepted earlier hoaxes like the Aztec crash, weighed the autopsy footage as additional evidence strengthening the connection between Roswell and extraterrestrials.

===&quot;The Day After Roswell&quot;===
In 1997, retired army intelligence officer Philip J. Corso released &quot;The Day After Roswell&quot;. Corso&#x27;s book combined many existing and conflicting conspiracy theories with his own claims. Corso alleged that he was shown a purportedly nonhuman body suspended in liquid inside a glass coffin. &quot;The Day After Roswell&quot; contains many factual errors and inconsistencies. For example, Corso says the 1947 debris was &quot;shipped to Fort Bliss, Texas, headquarters of the 8th Army Air Force&quot;. Other Roswell books place the 8th Army Air Force headquarters 500 miles away at its actual location, Fort Worth Army Air Field.

Corso further claimed that he helped oversee a project to reverse engineer recovered crash debris. Other ufologists expressed doubts about Corso&#x27;s book. Schmitt openly questioned if Corso was &quot;part of the disinformation&quot; Schmitt believed was working to discredit ufology. Corso&#x27;s story was criticized for its similarities to science fiction like &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Lacking evidence, the book relied on weight provided by Corso&#x27;s past work on the Foreign Technology Division, and a foreword from US Senator and World War II veteran Strom Thurmond. Corso had misled Thurmond to believe he was providing a foreword for a different book. Upon discovering the book&#x27;s actual contents, Thurmond demanded the publisher remove his name and writing from future printings stating, &quot;I did not, and would not, pen the foreword to a book about, or containing, a suggestion that the success of the United States in the Cold War is attributable to the technology found on a crashed UFO.&quot;

===Related debunked or fringe theories===
Roswell has remained the subject of divergent popular works, including those by ufologist Walter Bosley, paranormal author Nick Redfern, and American journalist Annie Jacobsen. In 2011, Jacobsen&#x27;s &quot;Area 51: An Uncensored History of America&#x27;s Top Secret Military Base&quot; featured a claim that Nazi doctor Josef Mengele was recruited by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to produce &quot;grotesque, child-size aviators&quot; to cause hysteria. The book was criticized for extensive errors by scientists from the Federation of American Scientists. Historian Richard Rhodes, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, also criticized the book&#x27;s sensationalistic reporting of &quot;old news&quot; and its &quot;error-ridden&quot; reporting. He wrote: &quot;All of [her main source&#x27;s] claims appear in one or another of the various publicly available Roswell/UFO/Area 51 books and documents churned out by believers, charlatans and scholars over the past 60 years. In attributing the stories she reports to an unnamed engineer and Manhattan Project veteran while seemingly failing to conduct even minimal research into the man&#x27;s sources, Jacobsen shows herself at a minimum extraordinarily gullible or journalistically incompetent.&quot;

In 2017, UK newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on Kodachrome slides which some had claimed showed a dead space alien. First presented at a UFO conference in Mexico, organized by Jaime Maussan and attended by almost 7,000 people, days afterwards it was revealed that the slides were in fact of a mummified Native American child discovered in 1896 and which had been on display at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum in Mesa Verde, Colorado, for many decades. In 2020, an Air Force historian revealed a recently declassified report of a circa-1951 incident in which two Roswell personnel donned poorly fitting radioactive suits, complete with oxygen masks, while retrieving a weather balloon after an atomic test. On one occasion, they encountered a lone woman in the desert, who fainted when she saw them. One of the personnel suggests they could have appeared to someone unaccustomed to then-modern gear, to be alien.

==Explanations==
Secrecy around the 1947 debris recovery was due to Cold War military programs rather than aliens. Contrary to evidence, UFO believers maintain that a spacecraft crashed near Roswell, and &quot;Roswell&quot; remains synonymous with UFOs. B. D. Gildenberg has called Roswell &quot;the world&#x27;s most famous, most exhaustively investigated, and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim&quot;. Some accounts are likely distorted memories of recoveries of servicemen in plane crashes, or parachute test dummies, as suggested by the Air Force in their 1997 report. Pflock argues that proponents of the crashed-saucer explanation tend to overlook contradictions and absurdities, compiling supporting elements without adequate scrutiny. Kal Korff attributes the poor research standards to financial incentives, &quot;Let&#x27;s not pull any punches here: The Roswell UFO myth has been very good business for UFO groups, publishers, for Hollywood, the town of Roswell, the media, and UFOlogy ... [The] number of researchers who employ science and its disciplined methodology is appallingly small.&quot;

===Project Mogul===
A 1994 USAF report identified the crashed object from the 1947 incident as a Project Mogul device. Mogulthe classified portion of an unclassified New York University atmospheric research projectwas a military surveillance program employing high-altitude balloons to monitor nuclear tests. The project launched Flight No. 4 from Alamogordo Army Air Field on June 4. Flight No. 4 was drifting toward Corona within 17 miles of Brazel&#x27;s ranch when its tracking equipment failed. Major Jesse Marcel and USAF Brigadier General Thomas DuBose publicly described the claims of a weather balloon as a cover story in 1978 and 1991, respectively. In the USAF report, Richard Weaver states that the weather balloon story may have been intended to &quot;deflect interest from&quot; Mogul, or it may have been the perception of the weather officer because Mogul balloons were constructed from the same materials. Sheridan W. Cavitt, who accompanied Marcel to the debris field, provided a sworn witness statement for the report. Cavitt stated, &quot;I thought at the time and think so now, that this debris was from a crashed balloon.&quot;

Ufologists had considered the possibility that the Roswell debris had come from a top-secret balloon. In March 1990, John Keel proposed that the debris had been from a Japanese balloon bomb launched in World War II. An Air Force meteorologist rejected Keel&#x27;s theory, explaining that the Fu-Go balloons &quot;could not possibly have stayed aloft for two years&quot;. Project Mogul was first connected to Roswell by independent researcher Robert G. Todd in 1990. Todd contacted ufologists and in the 1994 book &quot;Roswell in Perspective&quot;, Pflock agreed that the Brazel ranch debris was from Mogul. In response to a 1993 inquiry from US congressman Steven Schiff of New Mexico, the General Accounting Office launched an inquiry and directed the Office of the United States Secretary of the Air Force to conduct an internal investigation. Air Force declassification officer Lieutenant James McAndrew concluded:

===Anthropomorphic dummies===
The 1947 Roswell accounts did not mention alien bodies. None of the primary eyewitnesses mentioned bodies. Roswell authors interviewed only four people with supposed firsthand knowledge of alien bodies. The claims of alien bodiesmade decades later by elderly witnesses, sometimes as death-bed confessionscontradict each other in basic details such as the location of the crash, the number of extraterrestrials, and the description of the bodies.

The 1997 Air Force report concluded that the alleged &quot;bodies&quot; reported by later eyewitnesses came from memories of accidents involving military casualties and memories of the recovery of anthropomorphic dummies. Military programs, such as the 1950s Operation High Dive, released test dummies from high-altitude balloons above the New Mexico desert. The Air Force concluded that the number of accounts of body retrievals suggested an explanation other than dishonesty, and that the retrieval process for their dummies resembled the body retrieval stories in many aspects. The dummies were transported using stretchers, casket-shaped crates, and sometimes insulation bags that resembled body bags. Descriptions of &quot;weapons carriers&quot; and a &quot;jeeplike truck that had a bunch of radios&quot; matched the Dodge M37 used for 1950s test retrievals. Eyewitnesses described the purported bodies as bald, &quot;dummies&quot;, resembling &quot;plastic dolls&quot;, and wearing flight suits. These attributes were consistent with Air Force dummies used in the 1950s.

===Roswell as modern myth and folklore===
The mythology of Roswell involving increasingly elaborate accounts of alien crash landings and government cover-ups has been analyzed and documented by social anthropologists and skeptics. Anthropologists Susan Harding and Kathleen Stewart highlight the Roswell Story was a prime example of how a discourse moved from the fringes to the mainstream, aligning with the 1980s &quot;zeitgeist of&quot; public fascination with &quot;conspiracy, cover-up and repression&quot;. Skeptics Joe Nickell and James McGaha proposed that Roswell&#x27;s time spent away from public attention allowed the development of a mythology drawing from later UFO folklore, and that the early debunking of the incident created space for ufologists to intentionally distort accounts towards sensationalism.

Charles Ziegler argues that the Roswell story exhibits characteristics typical of traditional folk narratives. He identifies six distinct narratives and a process of transmission through storytellers, wherein a core story was formed from various witness accounts and then shaped and altered by those involved in the UFO community. Additional &quot;witnesses&quot; were sought to expand upon the core narrative, while accounts that did not align with the prevailing beliefs were discredited or excluded by the &quot;gatekeepers&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
===Tourism and commercialization ===
Roswell&#x27;s tourism industry is based on ufology museums and businesses, as well as alien-themed iconography and alien kitsch. Many typical city features in Roswell are UFO-themed, including fast food restaurants, grocery stores, and street lights. A broad range of establishments offer UFO items. A yearly UFO festival has been held since 1995. Several alleged crash sites are open to visitors for a fee. There are alien festivals, conventions, and museums, including the International UFO Museum and Research Center. Around 90,000 tourists visit Roswell each year.

===Popular fiction===
The incident spread internationally through films depicting the key points of Roswell conspiracy theories. In the 1980 independently distributed film &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, an alien ship crashes in the desert of the US Southwest. Debris and bodies are recovered, but their existence is covered up by the government. Director James L. Conway summarized the film as &quot;a modern-day dramatization of the Roswell incident&quot;. Conway later revisited the concept in 1995 when he filmed the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Little Green Men&quot;; In that episode, characters travel to 1947, triggering the Roswell incident, with their ship being stored in Hangar 18. In the 1996 film &quot;Independence Day&quot;, an alien invasion prompts the revelation of a Roswell crash and cover-up, including experiments on alien corpses. The 2008 film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; sees the protagonist on a quest for an alien body from the Roswell Incident.

In the 1990s, Roswell became the most well-known of the early flying saucer accounts, due in part to frequent portrayals of a Roswell conspiracy on television. The hit series &quot;The X-Files&quot; featured the Roswell incident as a recurring element. The show&#x27;s second episode &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, introduced a Roswell alien crash into the show&#x27;s mythology. The comical 1996 episode &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s From Outer Space&quot; satirized the recently-broadcast Santelli &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; hoax film. After the success of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Roswell alien conspiracies were featured in other sci-fi drama series, including &quot;Dark Skies&quot; (1996–97) and &quot;Taken&quot; (2002). Starting in 1998, Pocket Books published a series of young adult novels titled &quot;Roswell High&quot;; from 1999 to 2002, the books were adapted into the WB/UPN TV series &quot;Roswell&quot;, with a second adaption released in 2019 under the title &quot;Roswell, New Mexico&quot;.

Journalist Toby Smith has described Roswell as the &quot;embarkation point&quot; for mass media and pop culture treatment of UFOs, crashed saucers, and aliens on Earth. In a 2001 episode of the animated comedy &quot;Futurama&quot;, titled &quot;Roswell That Ends Well&quot;, protagonists from the 31st century travel back in time and cause the Roswell incident. The animated series &quot;American Dad&quot; features an alien named Roger who crashed at Roswell. The 2006 comedy &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; revolves around the 1990s creation of the Santilli hoax film. The 2011 Simon Pegg comedy &quot;Paul&quot; tells the story of Roswell tourists who rescue a grey alien.

===Statements by US presidents===
Widespread speculation of a cover-up led to United States presidents being questioned about the Roswell incident. In a 2014 interview, Bill Clinton said, &quot;When the Roswell thing came up, I knew we&#x27;d get gazillions of letters. So I had all the Roswell papers reviewed, everything&quot;. Clinton&#x27;s administration found no evidence of alien contact or a crashed ship. When asked during a 2015 interview with &quot;GQ&quot; magazine about whether he had looked at top-secret classified information, Barack Obama replied, &quot;I gotta tell you, it&#x27;s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that&#x27;s top secret isn&#x27;t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it&#x27;s not as top secret as you&#x27;d think.&quot; In December 2020, Obama joked with Stephen Colbert, &quot;It used to be that UFOs and Roswell was the biggest conspiracy. And now that seems so tame, the idea that the government might have an alien spaceship.&quot; In June 2020, Donald Trump, when asked if he would consider releasing more information about the Roswell incident, said, &quot;I won&#x27;t talk to you about what I know about it, but it&#x27;s very interesting.&quot;

<doc id="376989" wikidata="Q436780" url="?curid=376989" title="Amy Sherman-Palladino">
<text>Amy Sherman-Palladino (born January 17, 1966) is an American television writer, director, and producer. She is the creator of the comedy drama series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000–2007), &quot;Bunheads&quot; (2012–2013), and &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; (2017–2023).

Sherman-Palladino has received 6 Primetime Emmy Awards for her work, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Music Supervision, all for &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;. She made history when she became the first woman to win in the comedy writing and directing categories at the Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2019, she received the Norman Lear Achievement Award in Television from the Producers Guild of America.

Sherman-Palladino is the founder of Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions. She is known for her trademark rapid-fire dialogue, which is often full of pop culture references, and as well for her preferred master shot filming style.

==Early life==
Amy Sherman was born in Los Angeles, California. Her parents are comedian Don Sherman, who died in May 2012 (the first episode of &quot;Bunheads&quot; was dedicated to him), and dancer Maybin Hewes. Sherman was her father&#x27;s stage name. Her father, from the Bronx, was Jewish, and her mother was a Southern Baptist from Gulfport, Mississippi. She has stated that she was raised &quot;as Jewish. Sort of.&quot;

She was trained in classical ballet since she was four and took other forms of dance in her teens. Originally a trainee dancer, Sherman-Palladino had received a callback to the musical &quot;Cats&quot;, while also having a possible writing position on the staff of &quot;Roseanne&quot; in rotation. When she and writing partner Jennifer Heath were asked to join the staff of &quot;Roseanne&quot;, she left behind her dancing career — much to her mother&#x27;s chagrin – and began writing for television.

==Career==
Sherman-Palladino became a staff writer on &quot;Roseanne&quot; during the show&#x27;s third season in 1990. Among the storylines and episodes she wrote was an Emmy-nominated episode about birth control. 

She left the show after season six, in 1994, and worked on several other projects, including the failed 1996 sitcom &quot;Love and Marriage&quot;, the 1997 sitcom &quot;Over the Top&quot;, and writing several scripts of the NBC sitcom &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot;.

=== &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; ===
Sherman-Palladino is best known as the creator and executive producer of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000–07), a television comedy drama series that aired initially on The WB network and concluded on its successor network, The CW. A four-episode revival aired on Netflix in 2016. In selling the show, Sherman-Palladino says that during her pitch meeting for landing a script order, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; was presented as a last-ditch effort thought up on the spot due to a lacking response from the network executives towards her other ideas. She presented this last hope as a &quot;show about a mother and daughter, but they&#x27;re more like best friends&quot; and the executives were all sold immediately. During a trip to Connecticut, she and husband Daniel Palladino were inspired to center the show there, allowing a rich setting for a small-town community and the divide from the WASPy social setting of Hartford, Connecticut.

In producing the show, Sherman-Palladino and her husband wore many hats as the creative forces of the show, writing a large number of the episodes and also acting as directors, producers and showrunners for six years of its seven-year run.

===End of working relationship with &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;===
On April 20, 2006, it was announced that Sherman-Palladino and her husband Daniel could not come to an agreement with The CW to continue their contracts. As a result, the Palladinos&#x27; involvement with &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; came to an end. The official statement was as follows: &quot;Despite our best efforts to return and ensure the future of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; for years to come, we were unable to reach an agreement with the studio and are therefore leaving when our contracts expire at the end of this season. Our heartfelt thanks go out to our amazing cast, hard-working crew, and loyal fans.&quot; Writer and producer David S. Rosenthal replaced them.

The couple did an interview with &quot;TV Guide&quot; writer Michael Ausiello, where they went further into their reasons for leaving the show.

In a 2012 interview with &quot;Vulture&quot;, in which Sherman-Palladino was asked to reflect on the issue, she responded It was a botched negotiation. It really was about the fact that I was working too much. I was going to be the crazy person who was locked in my house and never came out. I heard a lot of &quot;Amy doesn&#x27;t need a writing staff because she and [her husband] Dan Palladino write everything!&quot; I thought, &quot;That&#x27;s a great mentality on your part, but if you want to keep the show going for two more years, let me hire more writers.&quot; By the way, all this shit we asked for? They had to do anyway when we left. They hired this big writing staff and a producer-director onstage. That&#x27;s what bugged me the most. They wound up having to do what we asked for anyway, and I wasn&#x27;t there.

===&quot;The Return of Jezebel James&quot;===
On August 1, 2006, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that the Fox Network had ordered a pilot of a new comedy project from Sherman-Palladino. The untitled comedy, which received a pilot commitment from the network, was about two sisters who come together after years apart, when one of the sisters agrees to carry the other&#x27;s baby. Sherman-Palladino wrote, executive produced and directed the pilot.

In December 2006, at the Hollywood Radio &amp; Television Society&#x27;s Hitmakers luncheon, Palladino revealed the name of her new sitcom: &quot;The Return of Jezebel James&quot;. The series debuted on March 14, 2008, on Fox starring Parker Posey. It was canceled on March 24, 2008, after only three episodes aired.

===&quot;Bunheads&quot;===
ABC Family picked up Sherman-Palladino&#x27;s pilot, &quot;Bunheads&quot;, to series. It premiered on June 11, 2012. The series stars Sutton Foster as a Las Vegas showgirl who, after impulsively getting married, moves to the sleepy coastal town of Paradise and winds up working at her new mother-in-law&#x27;s dance studio: The Paradise Dance Academy. Kelly Bishop, who portrayed Emily Gilmore in &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, plays the recurring role of Fanny Flowers, her mother-in-law. On July 22, 2013, five months after the end of Season 1, it was announced that &quot;Bunheads&quot; would not be renewed for a second season.

===&quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; revival===
In October 2015, it was reported on TVLine that Netflix struck a deal with Warner Bros. to revive the series in a limited run, consisting of four 90-minute episodes. Sherman-Palladino was in charge of the new episodes, titled &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;. The four episodes are named after the seasons, and all four became available on November 25, 2016.

===&quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;===
In June 2016, Amazon ordered an hour-long pilot from Sherman-Palladino entitled &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;, about a 1950s housewife who decides to become one of the first female stand-up comics. On August 5, 2016, it was reported that Rachel Brosnahan had been cast in the lead role as Miriam &quot;Midge&quot; Maisel. Tony Shalhoub and Marin Hinkle were later cast as the parents of Brosnahan&#x27;s character, Abe and Rose Weissman, with Michael Zegen joining as her husband, Joel Maisel. On March 2, 2017, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that Alex Borstein would be playing Susie Myerson. &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; was made available to watch on Amazon on March 17, 2017, as a part of Amazon Studios&#x27; spring pilot season, with viewers having the option to vote for it to be ordered to series. On April 10, 2017, it was announced that &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; had received an &quot;unprecedented&quot; two-season order from Amazon. The series was critically acclaimed; it won a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, and a Peabody Award in &quot;Entertainment&quot; at the 77th Annual Peabody Awards. Sherman-Palladino won Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Comedy Series at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards for &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;. The success led to an overall deal at Amazon Studios.

==Personal life==
Sherman-Palladino is married to Daniel Palladino, who has served as co-executive producer, writer, and director on many of her shows.

==Dialogue and style==
Dialogue in Sherman-Palladino&#x27;s work involves heavy use of pop culture references, delivered in a fast repartee, screwball-comedy style. Palladino is also very particular with her selection and use of music in her work. In an interview with &quot;OutSmart&quot; magazine, she explained how lazy and instructional its use is on most television shows:I think music on television is just uniformly dreadful. It is mundane, it says nothing. They use it to say, &quot;Here&#x27;s a funny moment!&quot; ... you know? It&#x27;s not an extension of the drama, it&#x27;s distraction. It&#x27;s like, &quot;I&#x27;ll distract you, so you won&#x27;t know how shitty the show is...like a laugh track. That, to me, is what music on television is. They score everything from beginning to end so that after a while the music is just like white noise. It&#x27;s not giving it its due, its place. Everything has its place. Shows would go by, and we wouldn&#x27;t put a lot of music in because to me the music was an extension of the drama, so if you just throw it in under everything, it&#x27;s like throwing a washing-machine sound effect in there, it&#x27;s not the point of it. It&#x27;s like having two characters have a long, not very interesting discussion for no other reason except to fill up screen time.

== Influences == 
She has cited comedians Erma Bombeck, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Joan Rivers, Elaine May, and Norman Lear as influences. She has cited Barbra Streisand, Stephen Sondheim, Tony Kushner, Carole King, and Bob Fosse as pop culture inspirations. She has also expressed her love of classic musicals such as &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948), &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), and &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953).

<doc id="376991" wikidata="Q3395309" url="?curid=376991" title="Poll tax (Great Britain)">
<text>The Community Charge, commonly known as the poll tax, was a system of local taxation introduced by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government whereby each taxpayer was taxed the same fixed sum (a &quot;poll tax&quot; or &quot;head tax&quot;), with the precise amount being set by each local authority. It replaced domestic rates in Scotland from 1989, prior to its introduction in England and Wales from 1990. The abolition of the poll tax was announced in 1991 and it was replaced in 1993 by the current system of the Council Tax.

==Origins==

The abolition of the rating system of taxes (based on the notional rental value of a house) to fund local government had been unveiled by Margaret Thatcher when she was Shadow Environment Secretary in 1974, and was included in the manifesto of the Conservative Party in the October 1974 general election. In the 1979 elections the Conservative manifesto stated that lowering income tax took priority. The Government published a green paper in 1981 under the title &quot;Alternatives to Domestic Rates&quot;. It considered a flat-rate per-capita tax as a supplement to another tax, noting that a large flat-rate tax would be seen as unfair.

The 1980s saw a period of general confrontation between central government and Labour-controlled local authorities over levels of expenditure (known as the &quot;rate-capping rebellion&quot;), which eventually led to the abolition of the Greater London Council and the six metropolitan county councils. The commitment to abolish the rates was replaced in the 1983 general election manifesto with a commitment to introduce the ability for central government to cap rates which it saw as excessive. This was introduced by the Rates Act 1984.

Although the rates system was supposed to have regular revaluations to minimise discrepancies, the revaluations in England and Wales had been cancelled in 1978 and 1983. The Scottish revaluation of 1985/1986 led to a great deal of criticism and gave added urgency to rates reform or replacement. 

The green paper of 1986, &quot;Paying for Local Government&quot;, produced by the Department of the Environment from consultations between Lord Rothschild, William Waldegrave and Kenneth Baker, proposed the poll tax. This was a fixed tax per adult resident, although there was a reduction for poor people. This charged each person for the services provided in their community. Owing to the variations in the amount of local taxes paid and the amount of grant provided by central government to individual local authorities, there were differences in the amount charged between councils.

It become known as the &quot;poll tax&quot; as this is a general term referring to a tax charged at an equal amount per head (also known as a head-tax), but also as a reference to historical unpopular head-taxes, in particular the English Poll Tax of 1379.

This proposal was contained in the Conservative manifesto for the 1987 General Election. The legislation introducing the poll tax was passed in 1987, 1988, and the new tax replaced the rates in Scotland from the start of the 1989/90 financial year and in England and Wales from the start of the 1990/91 financial year. Additionally, the Uniform Business Rate, levied by local government at a rate set by central government and then apportioned between local authorities in proportion to their population, was introduced.

The tax was not implemented in Northern Ireland, which continued, as it still does , to levy the rating system, despite some unionists calling for the region to have the same taxation system as Great Britain.

==Implementation==
The poll tax when implemented encountered a number of administrative and enforcement difficulties. Some renters did not pay, knowing they would have moved elsewhere by the time the bills arrived. Councils of towns with highly mobile populations, such as university towns, were faced with big store rooms of unprocessed &quot;gone-aways&quot;. The initial register, which was based on the rates register for &quot;owned&quot; houses, contained many irregularities from supplementary data sources such as housing benefit recipients.

A significant collection issue was the 20 per cent /100 per cent split. People in employment had to pay 100 per cent, while students and the registered unemployed paid 20 per cent. The nature of the shared house market meant that not even the landlord knew exactly who was living there; tenants were replaced and may have shared a &quot;single&quot; room with their partner. Therefore, the local council did not know who was living where and when.

Councils were burdened with the task of pursuing the large numbers of defaulters, many of whom were participating in organised resistance to the charge. There is also some evidence that the poll tax had a lasting effect of people not registering themselves on the electoral register to evade collection attempts, possibly because of the false impression that the words &quot;poll tax&quot; created. This may have affected the results of the 1992 general election, which ended in a fourth successive Conservative victory, despite most opinion polls pointing to a hung parliament or narrow Labour majority.

==Opposition==

The change from payment based on the worth of one&#x27;s house to a fixed rate was widely criticised as being unfair, and needlessly burdensome on those less well-off. Mass protests were co-ordinated by the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation, other national networks such as 3D (Don&#x27;t Register, Don&#x27;t Pay, Don&#x27;t Collect) and by hundreds of local Anti-Poll Tax Unions (APTUs), which were not aligned to any particular political grouping. In Scotland, where the tax was implemented first, the APTUs called for mass non-payment. As the tax neared its implementation in England, protests against it began to increase. That culminated in a number of poll tax riots. The most serious of those was on 31 March 1990a week before the implementation of the taxwhen between 70,000 and 200,000 people demonstrated against the tax. The demonstration around Trafalgar Square left 113 people injured and 340 under arrest, with over 100 police officers needing treatment for injuries. There were further conflicts and protests, but none on the scale of the Trafalgar Square riot.

As the amount of the poll tax began to rise and the inefficiency of local councils in their collection of the tax became apparent, large numbers of people refused to pay. Local councils tried to respond with enforcement measures, but they were largely ineffective given the huge numbers of non-payers. According to the BBC, up to 30 per cent of former ratepayers in some areas refused to pay.

The anti-poll-tax organisations encouraged non-payers not to register, to clog up the courts by contesting local council attempts to gain liability orders, and ultimately, not to attend court hearings arising from their non-compliance. In November 1990, South Yorkshire Police said they were planning to refuse to arrest poll tax defaulters, even when instructed to by the courts, because it would be &quot;physically impossible for the police because of the large number of defaulters&quot;.

The opposition Labour Party, at its 1988 annual conference, decided against support for a non-payment campaign. In July 1991, Terry Fields, Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Broadgreen, and a member of the Militant tendency, was imprisoned for sixty days for refusing to pay. At the time of Fields&#x27; jailing, Labour leader Neil Kinnock commented: &quot;Law makers must not be law breakers.&quot;

In popular culture, the punk band The Exploited featured the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Pay The Poll Tax&quot; in their album &quot;The Massacre&quot;, which was released on 15 April 1990.

Over 40 people collaborated on Punk Aide&#x27;s 1989 compilations &quot;Axe The Tax, Can&#x27;t Pay Won&#x27;t Pay&quot; and &quot;Fuck The Poll Tax&quot;. Oi Polloi and Chumbawamba released and toured an EP called &quot;Smash the Poll Tax&quot;. A compilation album, &quot;A Pox Upon The Poll Tax&quot;, was also released in 1989. The Orchids released &quot;Defy The Law&quot; in response to the Poll Tax.

On their 22 March 1990 &quot;Top Of The Pops&quot; appearance, Orbital performed &quot;Chime&quot; while wearing hoodies with a crosshair and seemingly-abstract images on them. Upon closer inspection, those images read &quot;no poll tax&quot;.

==Political consequences==
After the poll tax was announced, opinion polls showed the Labour opposition opening a strong lead over the Conservative government. Following the Poll Tax Riots, Conservative ministers contemplated abolition of the tax but knew that, as a flagship Thatcherite policy, its abolition would not be possible while Thatcher was still Prime Minister. Kinnock had vowed to abolish the poll tax if he won the next general election.

For this, among other reasons, Thatcher was challenged by Michael Heseltine for the Conservative leadership in November 1990. Although she prevailed by a margin of fifty votes, she narrowly missed the threshold to avoid a second vote, and on 22 November 1990 she announced her resignation after more than a decade in office. All three of the contenders to succeed her pledged to abandon the tax.

The successful candidate, John Major, appointed Heseltine to the post of Environment Secretary, responsible for replacing the poll tax. In early 1991 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, announced a rise in Value Added Tax from 15 to 17.5 per cent to pay for a £140 reduction in the tax. The abolition of the poll tax was announced on 21 March 1991.

The Conservative government was re-elected for a fourth successive term in office at the 1992 general election, shaking off the strong challenge from the Labour Party. The Labour Party having been defeated in this way, their leader Neil Kinnock resigned.

==Abolition==
By the time of the 1992 general election, legislation had been passed replacing the poll tax with the Council Tax from the start of the 1993/1994 financial year. The VAT rate of 17.5 per cent remained despite an earlier policy of charging a higher poll tax.

Council Tax strongly resembled the &quot;rates&quot; system of tax that had been in effect prior to the poll tax. The main differences (at the Council Tax&#x27;s inception) were that properties were placed in bands based on a range of property values, thereby capping the maximum amount, and that the tax was levied on the property&#x27;s capital value rather than on its notional rental value. Households with only one occupant were also entitled to a 25 per cent discount. The only substantial change since the introduction of the Council Tax form of direct taxation is the gradual introduction of certain exemptions and discounts.

In 2015, any remaining debt was written off in Scotland with the passage of the Community Charge Debt (Scotland) Act 2015.

<doc id="376996" wikidata="Q60378" url="?curid=376996" title="American School (economics)">
<text>The American School, also known as the National System, represents three different yet related constructs in politics, policy and philosophy. The policy existed from the 1790s to the 1970s, waxing and waning in actual degrees and details of implementation. Historian Michael Lind describes it as a coherent applied economic philosophy with logical and conceptual relationships with other economic ideas.

It is the macroeconomic philosophy that dominated United States national policies from the time of the American Civil War until the mid-20th century. Closely related to mercantilism, it can be seen as contrary to classical economics. It consisted of these three core policies:
# Protecting industry through selective high tariffs (especially 1861–1932) and through subsidies (especially 1932–1970).
# Government investments in infrastructure creating targeted internal improvements (especially in transportation).
# A national bank with policies that promote the growth of productive enterprises rather than speculation.

The American School&#x27;s key elements were promoted by John Quincy Adams and his National Republican Party, Henry Clay and the Whig Party and Abraham Lincoln through the early Republican Party which embraced, implemented and maintained this economic system.

==History==

===Origins===

The American School of economics represented the legacy of Alexander Hamilton, who in his &quot;Report on Manufactures&quot;, argued that the U.S. could not become fully independent until it was self-sufficient in all necessary economic products. Hamilton rooted this economic system, in part, in the successive regimes of Colbert&#x27;s France and Elizabeth I&#x27;s England, while rejecting the harsher aspects of mercantilism, such as seeking colonies for markets. As later defined by Senator Henry Clay who became known as the &quot;Father of the American System&quot; because of his impassioned support thereof, the American System was to unify the nation north to south, east to west, and city to farmer.

Frank Bourgin&#x27;s 1989 study of the Constitutional Convention shows that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the Founders. The goal, most forcefully articulated by Hamilton, was to ensure that dearly won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of Europe. The creation of a strong central government able to promote science, invention, industry and commerce, was seen as an essential means of promoting the general welfare and making the economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their own destiny.

Jefferson and Madison strongly opposed Hamilton&#x27;s program, but were forced to implement it by the exigencies of the embargo, begun in December 1807 under the Non-Intercourse Act, and the War of 1812 against Britain.

A number of programs by the federal government undertaken in the period prior to the Civil War gave shape and substance to the American School. These programs included the establishment of the Patent Office in 1802, the creation of the Survey of the Coast (later renamed the United States Coast Survey and then the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey) in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation created by the 1824 Rivers and Harbors Act.

Other developments included the various Army expeditions to the west, beginning with Lewis and Clark&#x27;s Corps of Discovery in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s (see for example, the careers of Major Stephen Harriman Long and Major General John C. Frémont), almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed (see, for example, the career of Brigadier General Randolph B. Marcy), the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals, and the establishment of the First Bank of the United States and Second Bank of the United States as well as various protectionist measures such as the Tariff of 1828.

Leading proponents were economists Friedrich List (1789–1846) and Henry Carey (1793–1879). List was a leading 19th Century German and American economist who called it the &quot;National System&quot; and developed it further in his book &quot;The National System of Political Economy&quot; Carey called this a &quot;Harmony of Interests&quot; in his book by the same name, a harmony between labor and management, and as well a harmony between agriculture, manufacturing, and merchants.

The name &quot;American System&quot; was coined by Clay to distinguish it, as a school of thought, from the competing theory of economics at the time, the &quot;British System&quot; represented by Adam Smith in his work &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;.

=== Central policies ===
The American School included three cardinal policy points:

# Support industry: the advocacy of protectionism, and opposition to free trade – particularly for the protection of &quot;infant industries&quot; and those facing import competition from abroad. Examples: Tariff Act of 1789, Tariff Act of 1816 and Morrill Tariff.
# Create physical infrastructure: government finance of internal improvements to speed commerce and develop industry. This involved the regulation of privately held infrastructure, to ensure that it meets the nation&#x27;s needs. Examples: Cumberland Road and Union Pacific Railroad.
# Create financial infrastructure: a government sponsored National Bank to issue currency and encourage commerce. This involved the use of sovereign powers for the regulation of credit to encourage the development of the economy, and to deter speculation. Examples: First Bank of the United States, Second Bank of the United States, and National Banking Act.

Henry C. Carey, a leading American economist and adviser to Abraham Lincoln, in his book &quot;Harmony of Interests&quot;, displays two additional points of this American School economic philosophy that distinguishes it from the systems of Adam Smith or Karl Marx:
# Government support for the development of science and public education through a public &#x27;common&#x27; school system and investments in creative research through grants and subsidies.
# Rejection of class struggle, in favor of the &quot;Harmony of Interests&quot; between: owners and workers, farmers and manufacturers, the wealthy class and the working class.

In a passage from his book, &quot;The Harmony of Interests&quot;, Carey wrote concerning the difference between the American System and British System of economics:

Two systems are before the world; ... One looks to increasing the necessity for commerce; the other to increasing the power to maintain it. One looks to underworking the Hindoo, and sinking the rest of the world to his level; the other to raising the standard of man throughout the world to our level. One looks to pauperism, ignorance, depopulation, and barbarism; the other to increasing wealth, comfort, intelligence, combination of action, and civilization. One looks towards universal war; the other towards universal peace. One is the English system; the other we may be proud to call the American system, for it is the only one ever devised the tendency of which was that of elevating while equalizing the condition of man throughout the world.

In the Civil War, a shortage of specie led to the issue of such a fiat currency, called United States Notes, or &quot;greenbacks&quot;. Towards the end of the Civil War in March 1865, Henry C. Carey, Lincoln&#x27;s economic advisor, published a series of letters to the Speaker of the House entitled &quot;The Way to Outdo England Without Fighting Her.&quot; Carey called for the continuance of the greenback policy even after the War, while also raising the reserve requirements of the banks to 50%. This would have allowed the US to develop its economy independent of foreign capital (primarily British gold). Carey wrote:

The most serious move in the retrograde direction is that one we find in the determination to prohibit the further issue of [United States Notes] ... To what have we been indebted for [the increased economic activity]? To protection and the &quot; greenbacks&quot;! What is it that we are now laboring to destroy? Protection and the Greenback! Let us continue on in the direction in which we now are moving, and we shall see ... not a re-establishment of the Union, but a complete and final disruption of it.

Carey&#x27;s plans did not come to fruition as Lincoln was assassinated the next month and new President Andrew Johnson supported the gold standard, and by 1879 the U.S. was fully back on the gold standard.

===Advocacy===

The &quot;American System&quot; was the name given by Henry Clay in a speech before Congress advocating an economic program based on the economic philosophy derived from Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s economic theories. Clay&#x27;s policies called for a high tariff to support internal improvements such as road-building, and a national bank to encourage productive enterprise and to form a national currency as Hamilton had advocated as Secretary of the Treasury.

Clay first used the term &quot;American System&quot; in 1824, although he had been working for its specifics for many years previously. Portions of the American System were enacted by Congress. The Second Bank of the United States was rechartered in 1816 for 20 years. High tariffs were maintained from the days of Hamilton until 1832. However, the national system of internal improvements was never adequately funded; the failure to do so was due in part to sectional jealousies and constitutional scruples about such expenditures.

Clay&#x27;s plan became the leading tenet of the National Republican Party of John Quincy Adams and the Whig Party of himself and Daniel Webster.

The &quot;American System&quot; was supported by New England and the Mid-Atlantic, which had a large manufacturing base. It protected their new factories from foreign competition.

The South opposed the &quot;American System&quot; because its plantation owners were heavily reliant on production of cotton for export, and the American System produced lower demand for their cotton and created higher costs for manufactured goods. After 1828 the United States kept tariffs low until the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1861.

===Executive opposition to the American System by the Jacksonians===
Opposition to the economic nationalism embodied by Henry Clay&#x27;s American System came primarily from the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, Martin van Buren, and James K. Polk. These three presidents styled themselves as the peoples&#x27; politicians, seeking to protect both the agrarian frontier culture and the strength of the Union. Jackson in particular, the founder of the movement, held an unflinching commitment to what he viewed as the sanctity of the majority opinion. In his first annual message to Congress, Jackson proclaimed that &quot;the first principle of our system [is] that the majority govern&quot;. This ideology governed Jackson&#x27;s actions throughout his presidency, and heavily influenced his protégé Martin van Buren as well as the final Jacksonian president, James K. Polk.

This commitment to the majority and to the voiceless came in direct conflict with many elements of the American System. The Jacksonian presidents saw key tenets of the American System, including the support for the Second Bank of the United States and advocacy of protectionist tariffs, as serving moneyed or special interests rather than the majority of Americans. The Jacksonians opposed other elements of Clay&#x27;s ideology, including support for internal infrastructural improvements, on the grounds that they represented governmental overstretch as well. Several key events, legislative conflicts, and presidential vetoes shaped the substantive opposition to the American System.

====Second Bank of the United States and the Bank War====
The first and most well-known battle between Jacksonians and Clay focused on the struggle over renewing the charter of the Second Bank of the United States. In Andrew Jackson&#x27;s first annual message to Congress in 1829, he declared that &quot;[b]oth the constitutionality and the expediency of the law creating this bank are well questioned by a large portion of our fellow-citizens, and it must be admitted by all that it has failed in the great end of establishing a uniform and sound currency&quot;. He further attacked the proponents of renewing the bank&#x27;s charter, scathingly referring to the &quot;stockholders&quot; seeking a renewal of their &quot;privileges&quot;.

This rhetoric, portraying the supporters of the bank as privileged individuals, and claiming the opposition of &quot;a large portion of our fellow-citizens&quot; crystallizes Jackson&#x27;s majoritarian distaste for the special interest serving economic nationalism embodied in the American System. Jackson&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury Roger B. Taney effectively summed up Jackson&#x27;s opposition to the Second Bank of the United States: &quot;&quot;It is a fixed principle of our political institutions to guard against the unnecessary accumulation of power over persons and property in any hands. And no hands are less worthy to be trusted with it than those of a moneyed corporation&quot;.

The two sides of the debate became even more starkly defined as a result of the actions of Second Bank President Nicholas Biddle and Henry Clay himself. Upon hearing of Jackson&#x27;s distaste for his bank, Biddle immediately set about opening new branches of the bank in key political districts in hopes of manipulating Congressional opinion. Although this action indeed helped acquire the votes necessary to pass the bill in Congress, it enraged Jackson. Jackson saw this manipulation as clear evidence of the penchant of a national bank to serve private, non-majoritarian interests.

Henry Clay&#x27;s American System supported the necessity for central institutions to &quot;take an activist role in shaping and advancing the nation&#x27;s economic development&quot;. The bank thus fit well into Clay&#x27;s worldview, and he took advantage of Biddle&#x27;s manipulation in order to pass the renewal bill through Congress, despite expecting Jackson&#x27;s inevitable veto. Clay hoped that when Jackson vetoed the bill, it would more clearly differentiate the two sides of the debate which Clay then sought to use to his advantage in running for president. With battle lines set, Jackson&#x27;s majoritarian opposition to the Second Bank of the United States helped him be elected to a second term.

====Tariff question====
The question of protective tariffs championed by the American System proved one of the trickiest for Jacksonian presidents. Tariffs disproportionately benefited the industrial interests of the North while causing injury to the import-dependent agrarian South and West. As a result, the issue proved extremely divisive to the nation&#x27;s unity, something Jacksonian presidents sought to protect at all costs. The Jacksonian presidents, particularly the southern-born Jackson, had to be extremely cautious when lowering tariffs in order to maintain their support in the North.

However, the tariffs indeed represented an economic nationalism that primarily benefited the Northern States, while increasing the cost of European imports in the South. This ran strongly contrary to Jacksonian ideals. In the end, despite Northern objections, both President Jackson and President Polk lowered tariffs. Jackson reformed the Tariff of 1828 (also known as the Tariff of Abominations) by radically reducing rates in the Tariff of 1832. This helped stave off the Southern nullification crisis, in which Southern states refused to enact the tariff, and threatened secession if faced with governmental coercion.

The bill that reduced the Tariff of 1828 was co-authored by Henry Clay in a desperate attempt to maintain national unity. Polk, on the other hand, in his characteristically efficient way, managed to push through significant tariff reductions in the first 18 months of his term.

====Opposition to government-financed internal improvements====
The final bastion of Jacksonian opposition to Clay&#x27;s American System existed in relation to the use of government funds to conduct internal improvements. The Jacksonian presidents feared that government funding of such projects as roads and canals exceeded the mandate of the federal government and should not be undertaken. Van Buren believed very strongly that &quot;[t]he central government, unlike the states&quot;, had no obligation to provide relief or promote the general welfare.

This stance kept faith with the tenets of Jeffersonian republicanism, notably its agrarianism and strict constructionism, to which van Buren was heir&quot;. As heir to the legacy of Van Buren and Jackson, Polk was similarly hostile to internal improvement programs, and used his presidential veto to prevent such projects from reaching fruition.

===Implementation===
An extra session of congress was called in the summer of 1841 for a restoration of the American system. When the tariff question came up again in 1842, the compromise of 1833 was overthrown, and the protective system placed in the ascendant.

Due to the dominance of the then Democratic Party of Van Buren, Polk, and Buchanan the American School was not embraced as the economic philosophy of the United States until the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, who, with a series of laws during the American Civil War, was able to fully implement what Hamilton, Clay, List, and Carey theorized, wrote about, and advocated.

As soon as Lincoln took office, the old Whig coalition finally controlled the entire government. It immediately tripled the average tariff, began to subsidize the construction of a transcontinental railroad in California even though a desperate war was being waged, and on February 25, 1862, the Legal Tender Act empowered the secretary of the treasury to issue paper money (&#x27;greenbacks&#x27;) that were not immediately redeemable in gold or silver. 

The United States continued these policies throughout the later half of the 19th century.

President Ulysses S Grant acknowledged the perceived efficacy of tariff protection in reference to Britain&#x27;s success during the Industrial Revolution, when tariff rates on manufactures peaked at 57%:

For centuries England has relied on protection, has carried it to extremes and has obtained satisfactory results from it. There is no doubt that it is to this system that it owes its present strength.

President William McKinley (1897–1901) stated at the time:

The American System was important in the election politics for and against Grover Cleveland, the first Democrat elected after the Civil War, who, by reducing tariffs protecting American industries in 1893, began rolling back federal involvement in economic affairs, a process that became dominant by the 1920s and continued until Herbert Hoover&#x27;s attempts to deal with the worsening Great Depression.

===Evolution===
As the United States entered the 20th century, the American School was the policy of the United States under such names as American Policy, economic nationalism, National System, Protective System, Protection Policy, and protectionism, which alludes only to the tariff policy of this system of economics.

This continued until 1913 when the administration of Woodrow Wilson initiated his The New Freedom policy that replaced the National Bank System with the Federal Reserve System, and lowered tariffs to revenue-only levels with the Underwood Tariff.

The election of Warren G. Harding and the Republican Party in 1920 represented a partial return to the American School through restoration of high tariffs. A subsequent further return was enacted as President Herbert Hoover responded to the 1929 crash and the subsequent bank failures and unemployment by signing the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which some economists considered to have deepened the Great Depression, while others disagree.

The New Deal continued infrastructure improvements through the numerous public works projects of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) as well as the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA); brought massive reform to the banking system of the Federal Reserve while investing in various ways in industry to stimulate production and control speculation; but abandoned protective tariffs while embracing moderate tariff protection (revenue based 20–30% the normal tariff under this) through reciprocity, choosing to subsidize industry as a replacement. At the close of World War II, the United States now dominant in manufacturing with little competition, the era of free trade had begun.

In 1973, when the &quot;Kennedy&quot; Round concluded under President Richard Nixon, who cut U.S. tariffs to all time lows, the New Deal orientation towards reciprocity and subsidy ended, which moved the United States further in the free market direction, and away from its American School economic system.

== Other nations ==

Friedrich List&#x27;s influence among developing nations has been considerable. Japan has followed his model. It has also been argued that Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s post-Mao policies were inspired by List as well as recent policies in India.

<text>The American system of manufacturing was a set of manufacturing methods that evolved in the 19th century. The two notable features were the extensive use of interchangeable parts and mechanization for production, which resulted in more efficient use of labor compared to hand methods. The system was also known as armory practice because it was first fully developed in armories, namely, the United States Armories at Springfield in Massachusetts and Harpers Ferry in Virginia (later West Virginia), inside contractors to supply the United States Armed Forces, and various private armories. The name &quot;American system&quot; came not from any aspect of the system that is unique to the American national character, but simply from the fact that for a time in the 19th century it was strongly associated with the American companies who first successfully implemented it, and how their methods contrasted (at that time) with those of British and continental European companies. In the 1850s, the &quot;American system&quot; was contrasted to the British factory system which had evolved over the previous century. Within a few decades, manufacturing technology had evolved further, and the ideas behind the &quot;American&quot; system were in use worldwide. Therefore, in manufacturing today, which is global in the scope of its methods, there is no longer any such distinction.

The American system involved semi-skilled labor using machine tools and jigs to make standardized, identical, interchangeable parts, manufactured to a tolerance, which could be assembled with a minimum of time and skill, requiring little to no .

Since the parts are interchangeable, it was also possible to separate manufacture from assembly and repair—an example of the division of labor. This meant that all three functions could be carried out by semi-skilled labor: manufacture in smaller factories up the supply chain, assembly on an assembly line in a main factory, and repair in small specialized shops or in the field. The result is that more things could be made, more cheaply, and with higher quality, and those things also could be distributed further, and lasted longer, because repairs were also easier and cheaper. In the case of each function, the system of interchangeable parts typically involved substituting specialized machinery to replace hand tools.

Interchangeability of parts was finally achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and machine tools, which were developed primarily for making textile machinery. These innovations included the invention of new machine tools and jigs (in both cases, for guiding the cutting tool), fixtures for holding the work in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts.

==Use of machinery==
English machine tool manufacturer Joseph Whitworth was appointed as a British commissioner for the New York International Exhibition. Accompanied by another British commissioner, he traveled around several states visiting various manufacturers, and as a result published a highly influential report on American manufacturing, from which he is quoted:

==Other characteristics==
The American system contributed to efficiency gains through division of labor. Division of labor helped manufacturing transition from small artisan&#x27;s shops to early factories. Key pieces of evidence supporting efficiency gains include increase in firm size, evidence of returns to scale, and an increase in non-specialized labor. The need for firms to train uneducated people to perform only one thing in the productivity chain allowed for the use of non-specialized labor. Women and children were employed more frequently within larger firms, especially those producing furniture and clothing..

==History==
In the late 18th century, French General Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval suggested that muskets could be manufactured faster and more economically if they were made from interchangeable parts. This system would also make field repairs easier to carry out under battle conditions. He provided patronage to Honoré Blanc, who attempted to implement the &quot;Système Gribeauval&quot;, but never succeeded. Until then, under the British factory system, skilled machinists were required to produce parts from a design. But however skilled the machinist, parts were never identical, and each part had to be manufactured separately to fit its counterpart—almost always by one person who produced each completed item from start to finish.

Mass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by Marc Isambard Brunel in cooperation with Henry Maudslay, and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Bentham, the Inspector General of Naval Works at Portsmouth Block Mills at Portsmouth Dockyard, for the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic War. By 1808 annual production had reached 130,000 sailing blocks. This method of working did not catch on in general manufacturing in Britain for many decades, and when it did it was imported from America, becoming known as the &quot;American System of Manufacturing&quot;, even though it originated in England.

The Lowell system is also related to the American system during this time. It emphasized procuring, training, and providing housing and other living necessities for the workforce, as well as using semi-automated machines in a centralized factory building or complex.

Gribeauval&#x27;s idea was conveyed to the US by two routes. First, Blanc&#x27;s friend Thomas Jefferson championed it, sending copies of Blanc&#x27;s memoirs and papers describing his work to Secretary of War Henry Knox. Second, artillery officer Louis de Tousard (who had served with Lafayette) was an enthusiast of Gribeauval&#x27;s ideas. Tousard wrote two influential documents after the American Revolution; one was used as the blueprint for West Point, and the other became the officer&#x27;s training manual.

The War Department, which included officers trained at West Point on Tousard&#x27;s manual, established the armories at Springfield and Harper&#x27;s Ferry and tasked them with solving the problem of interchangeability. The task was finally accomplished in the 1820s. Historian David A. Hounshell believes that this was done by Captain John H. Hall, an inside contractor at Harper&#x27;s Ferry. In a letter dated 1822 Hall makes the claim he had achieved interchangeability in that year. But historian Diana Muir argues that it is more probable that it was Simeon North, a Connecticut arms contractor manufacturing guns for the US Army. North, not Hall, was the inventor of the crucial milling machine in 1816, and had an advantage over Hall in that he worked closely with the first industry that mass-produced complex machines from mass-produced interchangeable parts, the Connecticut clock-making industry. By 1815 the idea of interchangeability was well established in the US government system of procurement; Congressional contracts stipulated this quality in muskets, rifles and pistols ordered after that date. Interchangeability of firearms parts at the U.S. armories was found to have been in use for a number of years by the time of the 1853 British Parliamentary Commissions Committee on Small Arms inquiry.

The &quot;American method&quot; was reintroduced to the UK in the 1850s, when Colt executed on order on naval revolvers in Pimlico, and strikes of London and Birmingham gunmakers during the war made the War Office realize the usefulness of being able to employ low-skilled workers, so milling machines were bought and installed at the Royal Small Arms Factory by 1857.

A critical factor in making interchangeable metal parts was the invention of several machine tools, such as the slide rest lathe, screw cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. One of the most important and versatile of these machine tools was David Wilkinson&#x27;s lathe, for which he received a $10,000 award from the government of the United States.

Eli Whitney is generally credited with the idea and the practical application, but both are incorrect attributions. Based on his reputation as the inventor of the cotton gin, the US government gave him a contract in 1798 for 10,000 muskets to be produced within two years. It actually took eight years to deliver the order, as Whitney perfected and developed new techniques and machines. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott apologizing for the delays, Whitney wrote:

Whitney did use machinery; however, there is no evidence that he produced any new type of metalworking machinery. After completing the initial contract, Whitney went on to produce another 15,000 muskets within the following two years. Whitney never actually expressed any interest in interchangeability until 1800, when Treasury Secretary Wolcott exposed him to the memoirs of Blanc, but he spent far more time and energy promoting the idea than developing it.

In order to spread knowledge of manufacturing techniques, the War Department made contractors open their shops to other manufacturers and competitors. The armories also openly shared manufacturing techniques with private industry. Additionally, the idea migrated from the armories to industry as machinists trained in the armory system were hired by other manufacturers. Skilled engineers and machinists thus influenced American clockmakers and sewing machine manufacturers Wilcox and Gibbs and Wheeler and Wilson, who used interchangeable parts before 1860. Late to adopt the interchangeable system were Singer Corporation sewing machine (1870s), reaper manufacturer McCormick Harvesting Machine Company (1870s–80s) and several large steam engine manufacturers such as Corliss (mid-1880s) as well as locomotive makers. Large scale of production of bicycles in the 1880s used the interchangeable system.

The idea would also help lead to the American &quot;Golden Age&quot; of manufacturing when Ransom E. Olds mass-produced the Curved Dash automobile starting in 1901. Henry Ford did not start mass producing cars until 1913. Mastering true interchangeability on the assembly line, the Ford plant produced standard model cars. These efficient production strategies allowed these automobiles to be affordable for the middle class.

=== Pre–Industrial Revolution ===

The idea of interchangeable parts and the separate assembly line was not new, though it was little used. The idea was first developed in East Asia during the Warring States period and later the Qin dynasty over 2200 years ago – bronze crossbow triggers and locking mechanisms were mass-produced and made to be interchangeable. Venice during the late Middle Ages had ships that were produced using pre-manufactured parts, assembly lines, and mass production. The Venetian Arsenal apparently produced nearly one ship every day, in what was effectively the world&#x27;s first factory.
