<text>The Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, also known as the Blues, or abbreviated as RHG, was one of the Cavalry regiments of the British Army, and part of the Household Cavalry. In 1969, it was amalgamated with the 1st The Royal Dragoons to form the Blues and Royals.

Raised in August 1650 by Sir Arthur Haselrig on the orders of Oliver Cromwell, following the 1660 Stuart Restoration, it became the Earl of Oxford&#x27;s Regiment in 1660. Based on the colour of their uniform, the regiment was nicknamed &quot;the Oxford Blues&quot;, or simply the &quot;Blues.&quot; In 1750, it became the Royal Horse Guards Blue and eventually, in 1877, the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues).

== Origins and history ==
The Royal Regiment of Horse Guards has its origins in the Regiment of Cuirassiers, raised by Sir Arthur Haselrig on the orders of Oliver Cromwell at Newcastle upon Tyne and County Durham in August 1650. It was initially disbanded following the 1660 Stuart Restoration, before being re-constituted in the wake of the Venner Riots and creation of the English Army on 26 January 1661. The colonelcy of the new regiment was given to Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford, and the regiment first paraded at Tothill Fields in London on 6 February 1661.

Early duties focused on internal policing and domestic security, with three troops based primarily in Canterbury, Southwark, and Bagshot. When James II of England succeeded in February 1685 it was recalled to do policing duties in London. John Churchill, later Earl of Marlborough deserted the royal household to greet William, Prince of Orange in 1688. The following year The Blues were part of the allied army that defeated the French at Walcourt, near Charleroi, when they charged the best French infantry, leaving 2,000 dead.

=== Wars of succession ===

During the early eighteenth century the Blues were widely dispersed throughout the north country. Following the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740, the Royals became part Honywood&#x27;s brigade, arriving in Flanders in August 1742. An account of the campaign was provided by Dr John Buchanan, the regimental surgeon. The unit took part in the 1743 Battle of Dettingen, after which the Household Cavalry Brigade was formed for the first time, comprising the Life Guards, Horse Grenadiers, and Blues.

=== Granby and Seven Years&#x27; War ===
During the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Blues fought alongside Prince Ferdinand. The largest cavalry regiment, The Blues colonelcy was assumed by John Manners, Marquess of Granby. This great soldier understood the importance of morale. In the mould of John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier, a predecessor, he established a brave and efficient force. His successor, Henry Seymour Conway was one of the greatest colonels the regiment ever had over a 25-year period. Granby however, retained a passionate interest in the welfare of The Blues; his generosity and hospitality expressed later in a legion of public houses. Granby was in charge of the second division at Battle of Minden Heath in August 1759. The Blues posted sentries called &quot;Vedettes&quot;, who were so close when the French attacked that the regiment was thrown back. The Blues were eager to charge in after the infantry surge to Minden walls, but owing to Lord George Sackville&#x27;s orders the reinforcements were delayed. Sackville was court-martialled and found guilty of disobeying orders.

The allies had saved Hanover, and driven Marshal Louis Georges Érasme de Contades back towards the Rhine. By December 1759 The Blues were exhausted looking forward to a winter break at Osnabrück. Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston went to recruit in England; and found the Dragoon Guards who wanted to join for the superior conditions in The Blues. Granby was depressed by his son&#x27;s death and that of his wife too, and the loss of his stud, so he decided to set up a Widows&#x27; Fund, and to provide better regimental medical care. His cousin, Russell Manners was raised to battalion command; and King George II&#x27;s interest in The Blues was inherited by George III. Granby commanded The Blues and The Royals on their march south from Paderborn. At Warburg on 31 July 1760, The Blues lined up in the centre. The British force of 8,000 stole a march on the French positions, and charging headlong into the enemy dispersed a force of 24,000. The famous &#x27;Charge&#x27; on trumpet and bugle sent Granby&#x27;s men into history:

In February 1761, The Gold Stick, Granby led The Blues and others in a brilliant campaign. The French were hunkered down when surprised by the allies on the march, driving them back 50 miles over muddy roads. The regiment was present in the summer at the Villinghausen when they took a force twice their size led by Charles, Prince of Soubise, with the flexible use of artillery fire; the cavalry unable to gallop in the terrain. 15th Light Dragoons and The Blues encountered a skirmishing force at Wilhelmsthal on 1 July 1761. The cavalry realizing the enemy&#x27;s presence took the initiative, demoralizing the French while the infantry finished. ADC Henry Townshend wounded at Vellinghausen, was killed with a trooper and three horses. Henry Seymour Conway marched the regiment to a triumphal return to England in March 1763. On demobilization, the troopers were reduced from 52 to 29 men per troop.

If Granby&#x27;s grief at his son&#x27;s loss was saddening, the crippling reductions to The Blues, according to William Pitt the Elder doomed &quot;the bravest men the world ever saw to be sent to starve in country villages and forget their prowess.&quot; The harvest failures of the 1760s were compounded by rioting. The Blues were depressed to leave ex-comrades in Germany; they were used as militia for policing duties. Granby died in January 1770, to be replaced by General Seymour Conway as colonel.

=== Reform at Horse Guards ===
On returning to civil duties again in 1795 The Blues were expected to maintain public order in Loughborough and Coventry; developing the doctrinal laws of absolute military necessity. They also patrolled the shoreline for smugglers. The Blues for the most part remained in the East Midlands. In 1788 and 1789 The Blues were required to come to London to mount up the King&#x27;s Life Guard, as there were inadequate personnel in the Life Guards thanks to reorganization and reform. The lack of recruits threatened the Expeditionary Forces viability in Holland. The Blues were part of a contingent of 3,500 cavalry who departed Northampton with Sir Charles Turner.

In June 1793 The Blues were royal reviewed at Northampton. Commanded by Lt-Colonel Turner, they disembarked at Ostend on 15 June. They marched to join the allied army at Valenciennes, being besieged by Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. The Blues and The Royals encountered the French at Dunkirk in a sea board march. Lieutenant Board was unhorsed and killed by a cannonball. Skirmishes continued all year, and by November they retired to winter in Ghent. The new Depot System worked well, and 1794 started with promise of success. The Blues were in Major General John Mansel&#x27;s brigade, as the allies laid siege to Landrecies. Mansel was criticized as being slow to engage the enemy, when a large French force left Cambrai on 23 April 1794. Mansel was still in command when the allied army took a position north of Cambrai on the Beaumont road. Mansel vowed to avenge the shame of 24th, he told Prince Frederick, Duke of York, which he did charging and scattering the enemy, but was killed. The French line caught totally off guard were broken in the open, losing 5,000 men. The Blues lost 15 men, Quartermaster John Kipling, and 25 horses. In total allied casualties were 150. The regiment earned the epithet &quot;Immortals&quot; in this action.

Now commanded by Ralph Dundas, the Blues and the Royals pursued the French infantry northwards from Beaumont trapping them in a quagmire near the village of Baisieux. A French general was fought to a standstill and run through by Private Joseph White. The battered French army retreated to Tournai. York moved into Roubaix, but Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor had run out on the allies, and returned to Vienna. The Blues returned to the depot at Northampton.

=== The Blues find a permanent home at Windsor ===

In 1796 The Blues received new weapons – the curved sabre, and the Nock Pattern Carbine. A reorganization at Horse Guards posted The Blues to a new base at Windsor. George III liked the regiment, who acted as royal bodyguards. A new barracks was built on 14 acres at Clewer Park in 1800, where a permanent barracks was built over a period of four years: 62 eight-bed dormitories for the men. Whilst life in the mess got more expensive and sociable, rates of pay stagnated. It was even more a requirement that all officers came from a moneyed background. By 1790 cornets were required to be aged eighteen, stabilizing entrants qualifications, and enabling purchasing to advance promotion rapidly. Quartermaster purchases attracted very modest incomers, raising a prospect for class mobility. And by 1800 only nine regimental commissions had transferred out in 20 years. But recruitment of cornets remained difficult in peacetime.

Recruits had to pay as much as 5 guineas for a riding lesson. Officer cadets would study &quot;Regulations for the formation and Movement of the Cavalry&quot;, spending a year at regimental HQ. In 1802, &quot;The British Military Library journal&quot; was established to educate on military tactics. Stable parades happened four times daily, and great care was taken of horses. Field day drills took place in Windsor Great Park or on Winkfield Plain every Friday. Quartermaster became an increasingly responsible rank. Wives were permitted to share at Clewer Park. Messes were created for NCO&#x27;s. During the Peninsular War gambling became fashionable amongst Blues&#x27; officers; and several ran up huge debts. They became a popular regiment in a royal location. Duelling was common and sent up in a number of parodies as described in the &quot;Blueviad&quot;.

More serious was the rioting of 1810 which ended in the attempted arrest of Sir Francis Burdett MP. The mob cried out for the Radical Burdett cajoling the government into ordering troops in from Clewer Park. Under the Regency Act, the King was incapacitated, therefore the Prince Regent demanded The Blues turn out in its smartest dress with the Life Guards. They were on crowd control duties on 19 June 1811 at the opening of parliament. When Princess Amelia died, they escorted the funeral cortege, on 13 November 1810, every fourth man carried a flambeau, a fact which was for the first time in the Annual Register. On the opening of parliamentary session for 1812, they marched with the Prince Regent to Westminster. But from May 1812 they were at barracks in Warrington, Lancashire to quell serious bread riots and, so had been unable to prevent the assassination of Spencer Perceval, the Prime Minister, on 11 May. Designed to also assuage the volatile rhetoric of Burdett who labelled the Household Cavalry in the Commons as &quot;the military murders&quot;. While the Blues had not been involved with the Life Guards arrest of the MP, the Blues had trampled onlookers in the Windsor riots when the horses ran scared. Hence the old military adage &quot;hold your horses&quot;.

=== With Wellington&#x27;s Peninsular Army ===
Detachments of Blues were increased from six to eight, as four troops embarked at Portsmouth for Portugal in October 1812. Their new colonel was the rich Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland, who used experience, had served in the American wars, and now wished to spend a small fortune on the regimental band. Unfortunately he clashed with Horse Guards over the modernized regimental kit, which the Duke wanted to ditch for the traditional. His particular disagreement with Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington was the appointment of senior officers, which Northumberland, ever the optimist, considered within his purview. He lost the argument and replaced by Wellington himself on 1 January 1813 as colonel of the regiment. Horse Guards&#x27; military secretary Colonel Henry Torrens had told the regimental commander, Sir Robert Chambre Hill that such appointments were unauthorised. &quot;I have never conceived the Corps to possess such a privilege ... unless the evidence could be adduced&quot;, wrote the C-in-C the Duke of York from Oatlands Palace on 25 October. The Blues could not have the same access to the Sovereign as the Life Guards retorted the Duke, but were paid more than other regiments. On 10 December he concluded:

Having discounted any principle of customary succession, Wellington felt free to promote on merit, which he achieved from 1813, already considering the Blues as part of the Household Cavalry. Captain Charles Murray was promoted to command 2nd Troop, brought off half-pay, on the basis solely of rank. The inability to promote from within by the Duke unduly caused his resignation on the augmentation of the Household regiments. The furious Northumberland vowed never to support the Tories again. But the Duke of York&#x27;s &quot;firmness&quot; had shown the chain of command could not be challenged by a colonel. Adverting to a new cornet vacancy, Lord William Lennox was duly dispatched to Spain in early 1813.

One of Wellington&#x27;s first acts as colonel was to employ Greenwood, Cox &amp; Co as agents. They had long been known to him but now he arranged to supply all their provisioning guaranteed by Whitehall. Messrs Bruce and Brown were recruited to provide clothing. The colonel was forced to make savings, excluding the maintenance of a band. Wellington founded the principle commissioning system of Ne Plus Ultra (Not a penny more), later the name given to his Tory supporters in the Commons.

The youthful troopers dispatched, they travelled with light camping equipment, and acquired a regimental mascot, a Newfoundland dog. In April 1812 General Wellington aimed to make a decisive assault on Madrid. To capture the Spanish capital he sent a cavalry division, including The Blues at first under General Francis Slater Rebow&#x27;s brigade and then Sir Robert. By about 15 January 1813 the Blues had reached Thomar. Hill was ordered to rendez-vous at Alba de Tormes, crossing the Douro the army pressed on to the city of Salamanca. After quarters in monasteries the brigade forded the Douro at Toro on 4 June. Two days they escorted the reserve artillery to Valoria; totally outflanked the enemy withdrew to Burgos. Encamped outside Burgos the brigade was awakened by a huge explosion at dawn on 13 January: the French had decided to blow up the Castle of Burgos. In a lightning quick march Wellington circled across the Ebro cutting off the French retreat to Vitoria at Puente da Arenas. The Household Cavalry were ordered to Carcarno with the reserves. Hill was ordered to seize the bridges at La Puebla in preparation for a three-pronged assault on the French positions in the mountainous passes. Arriving at Subijana de Álava Hill&#x27;s brigade rolled back the French left onto Vitoria. In 1813, Major Packe took temporary command in the Battle of Vitoria, traversing a deep ravine along the Pamplona road. The Blues, with Household brigade already engaged, wheeled right across the ravine. Bivouacked on the road at Pamplona, General Hill had orders to hold it as the Life Guards gave chase. The deftness of the manoeuvre embarrassed the French generals: the defeat ended Napoleon&#x27;s grip on Spain. The victory earned Wellington a Field Marshal&#x27;s baton.

The Blues were sent home in 1814 via St Jean de Luz, where they were joined by three fresh squadrons under Captains Irby and Kenyon and Major Fitzgerald. Stapleton Cotton could not praise highly enough the regiment&#x27;s conduct, so while the older Life Guards were sent home, the Blues remained on active service. Marching to Bayonne and Pau they arrived at Toulouse on 10 April 1814.

=== Waterloo ===
Robert Hill was appointed to command The Blues in his brother&#x27;s stead. The eldest was ennobled, and the youngest was ADC; but in fact Hill commanded a brigade of artillery on the extreme right of the line near Hougoumont. They were in Lord Uxbridge&#x27;s Cavalry corps of 14,550 troops. Not Wellington&#x27;s first choice, Uxbridge was richly attired, powerful, with influential friends, and a showman to boot. The Oxford Blues were in the mid-column of Sir John Eiley&#x27;s Household Brigade, when they marched in the early hours of 16 June 1815 towards Quatre Bras via Enghien down narrow Belgian lanes. They spent an uncomfortable night; the weather was hot and humid and it rained all night. As dawn broke, heavy rain made the ground a quagmire. On the day of battle, The Blues drew up in the second line behind the Life Guards. They should have held the formation, when Uxbridge gave the order to charge. Robert Hill was wounded in the clash with the 4th Cuirassiers, shot by a chasseur. Major Packe was run through and fell dead off his horse; indeed all the commanding officers in the brigade were slain in their ferocious attack on the Curassiers. Many hundreds of Frenchmen were killed, and 1200 taken prisoner. Charging through the regiment was in danger of going too far from La Haye Sainte, they were rescued by General Somerset. They fought Michel Ney&#x27;s cavalry to a standstill, until Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher&#x27;s Prussians appeared to the left, and recovered the hilltop commanded by La Haye.

One historical record that emerges is the perfunctory effectiveness of the surgery on the battlefield of Waterloo. For example, only six of the wounded fifty Blues actually died. They lost 44 killed. Some reported barbarism by the French upon prisoners. Waterloo proved the Guards were fit for active service...when we was about two hundred yards from the French lines a cannon ball came and took off my horses leg so I dismounted but looking around I saw a horse that somebody had been killed off so I soon got another. So we continued in that state until night the Prussians came up and began to work and the French began to run and a happy sight it was.

Trumpeter Tom Evans who had saved General Robert Hill&#x27;s life, retired to start a pub in Old Windsor, called the &quot;Oxford Blue&quot;. The Cavalry left Brussels and rode on to Paris.

On 22 June 1815, Napoleon abdicated having lost the support of the Assembly. All was lost for the Emperor. Marshal Grouchy&#x27;s corps was still intact, and Marshal Davout in Paris was willing to fight on, but France was beaten. The Household Brigade reached Boissy, a town already looted by the Prussians, only 12 miles from Paris, and the war was already over.

Until early 1816, the British were an army of occupation on French soil. They took time to recover, and restock the regiments, recruit more men, and promote survivors. The Blues returned to the barracks at Windsor. The decisive point for the Cavalry at Waterloo came when the Household and Union Brigades had charged d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s Corps, making the cavalry brigades national heroes for a few years afterwards. On Lady Day, 25 March 1816, a medal was struck for &quot;Waterloo men&quot;, the first to be so since Battle of Dunbar in 1650. It started a Victorian tradition rewarding gallantry, bravery and valorous conduct has remained to this day, through a system of medal awards as commemoration.

=== The Household Blues ===

The Prince Regent made himself Colonel-in-Chief of Life Guards and The Blues on becoming king on 29 January 1820. The Blues pay remained lower. They rotated between Windsor, Regent&#x27;s Park and Knightsbridge from 1821. On 24 October 1818, The Gold Sticks were ordered to cut 104 men from The Blues – they were to pick only the strongest, fittest and best appearance in the troops. At George IV&#x27;s coronation on 19 July 1821, he ordered the Household Cavalry to wear cuirasses.

On 7 August 1821 only weeks after the coronation, from which she was excluded, Queen Caroline died, having first expressed her wish to be buried in her native Brunswick. On 14 August, a squadron of The Blues arrived, led by Captain Bouverie to take her body to Romford. They pulled up at Brandenburgh House, Hammersmith to meet the local magistrate Sir Robert Baker. The mob planned to hijack the procession in the city, but when the hearse arrived to go through Hyde Park, the gates were slammed in their faces. The Life Guards came to their aid. The mob blocked Hyde Park Corner and Park Lane, so Baker had to change the route to Piccadilly. The cortege reached Tyburn Gate but it was barricaded. The Life Guards were involved in containing the violence, whilst the Blues still faced escorting through hostile crowds of belligerent Londoners.

In January 1830, The Blues&#x27; entire regiment escorted the funeral cortege for George IV to St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, doing homage to a grateful king.

=== The Colonels-in-chief ===

Even in 1780 roughly half all officers were from middle-class backgrounds, and this hardly changed throughout the Imperial era. It was only among the general class and the cavalry more widely did the landed families succeed to commissions from their more rural hinterlands. Even in the 20th century the horsemanship of hunters drew them naturally to cavalry elites, which was accentuated by the dominance of those public school-educated officers in the Indian army. Rising professionalism meant a better educated, trained and equipped cavalry in late 19th and 20th centuries increasingly drew officers from London and the southern counties.

Wellington was the first Blues Gold Stick and was colonel of The Blues until 1827. This put the regiment on a similar parity with Life Guards in terms of access to the king. The Duke, however, did not believe in bucking the chain of command, and declined to exercise extraordinary influence outside the fact that The Blues had become part of the Household Cavalry on 29 January 1820. Wellington did approve of the appointment of Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere to the Life Guards, but when the Duke of York died in 1827, the Iron Duke was finally made commander-in-chief. When Wellington became colonel of the Grenadier Guards (previously 1st Foot Guards) he was made to give up the Gold Stick. His successor was Ernest, Duke of Cumberland. The royal Duke believed the Gold Sticks-in-waiting should have absolute authority over their regiments. But the old Duke of Northumberland had resigned over this very issue and the new King William IV had the last word. He ruled that in all operational matters beyond ceremonial duties, the Household Cavalry would fall into the Commander-in-chief&#x27;s care and command. Cumberland angrily resigned in a huff.

The youngest of the three Hill brothers, Clement Hill who had been Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill&#x27;s ADC, now the colonel of The Blues, became commanding officer. The trend was moving towards choosing operational commanders as colonel who would be fit for active service. To that end General Lord Hill, while Commander-in-Chief ordered that a cricket ground be built adjacent to every barracks. Queen Victoria in 1837 strongly approved of a policy of meritorious promotion. In 1842 she selected Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey to succeed Hill as colonel of The Blues.

=== Soldiers&#x27; well-being ===

The cost of commissions for The Blues were broadly the same as Life Guards. But the costs of uniforms, horses and mess bills meant a private income was essential. India was the only opportunity for active service. But Household officers did not often want to transfer there. One Blues officer, Captain Hugh Duncan Baillie kept his mistress, Lady Glintworth in Clarence Crescent. But the quality of life for officers, and their level of pay differed markedly with NCO&#x27;s. In Windsor, the soldiers were by mid-century living in chronically overcrowded rooms. They slept on straw palliases, and there was no running water, nor private bathrooms. The transmission of disease became epidemic at Knightsbridge Barracks, because there was not proper toilet paper. A report into the health of the Indian establishment concluded:

Officers in the Royal Horse Guards had the lowest casualty rate per 1,000 of mean strength only 9.5 in the first half of 19th century. By contrast in Bengal men&#x27;s deaths were 73.8 and officers 30.5, still more than three times higher. The Report&#x27;s authors estimated that of 9.5, 5.4 of those lives could have been saved but for terrible conditions in England&#x27;s barracks:

It took the revelations during the Crimean War for army reforms to introduce changes. Dr Cosmo Gordon Logie was the crusading Medical Officer, of The Blues, who wrote an article condemning some barracks as unfit for human habitation.

=== Troubles in the Crimea ===
FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan was colonel of The Blues when he sailed for the Crimea in 1854. He had lost an arm at Waterloo, and was a successful Staff Officer on the Peninsula. But at sixty-five he had not led an operational army. He was brave, charming, but incompetent. He jumped in the mess when the French arrived, forgetting that they were allies. Horse Guards had thought a Transport Corps unnecessary, and now men lay dying of cholera through lack of provision for fresh food, and clean water. Moreover, all the horses were dying from glanders.

The regiment played a key role in the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854. Sir Colin Campbell commanding the Highland Brigade, reinforced by Raglan&#x27;s infantry, at 5 am had heard the Russian General Pavel Liprandi was moving 25,000 cavalry in 35 squadrons forward to take the Allied positions in front of Sevastopol. At daybreak, Raglan left the Light Brigade under James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan in reserve, whilst going with General James Yorke Scarlett&#x27;s Heavy Brigade and horse artillery to meet the Russian move. The Russian cannon decimated the Allied horses. They successfully occupied the redoubts before launching an attack on the British positions at Balaclava. The horse artillery did return fire, but since the heavy horses had been sent back for supplies, there was no way of getting more ammunition. The 93rd Highlanders stood in a &quot;thin red line&quot; as the Russian Hussars charged down on towards them. The British waited until the last minute to give the order to fire. Almost upon the bayonets, the Russians wheeled first left and then right before disappearing towards their own lines. The Heavy Brigade of Scots Greys, Inniskillings, Dragoons and Blues were formed up by Scarlett as the black looking mass of 2,000 Russian Hussars and Lancers appeared over the hill. 300 of them charged the Russian lines and despite being heavily outnumbered managed to push the Russians back. Casualties were relatively light on both sides. This action was a relative success in contrast to the Light Brigade&#x27;s charge against artillery led by George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan. By January 1856, the cavalry had managed to construct small wooden huts, and life slowly began to improve.

=== The Cardwell Reforms ===

Before the war in 1853, the sandy land near and around Aldershot was acquired by the War Office. When the Cavalry returned some of the regiments were sent back to that town. A permanent camp was ordered to be established here after the war. More garrisons were established at Colchester in Essex, Shorncliffe in Kent, and the Curragh in County Kildare, Ireland. From 1868 Edward Cardwell began a series of significant Liberal government reforms to the War Office and the army. He faced considerable opposition from Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, Commander-in-chief. Cardwell&#x27;s reforms were impactful for a generation. One important change was abolition of the purchase system. Cambridge led a spirited defence of it in parliament.

From 1850 to 1899, 39 peers&#x27; sons served in The Blues: the highest concentration in the regiment&#x27;s history (77 in Life Guards). John Brocklehurst was the son of Henry Brocklehurst, a successful Macclesfield silk miller, who went on to be a major-general. It was typical of industrial classes &#x27;in trade&#x27; to be contributing to the ranks of The Blues.

=== A Nile Expeditionary Force ===
In an 1871 speech to the Commons, Captain Talbot MP hinted that due to the success of German Uhlans in defeating the French heavy cavalry in the recent Franco-Prussian War, the era of heavy cavalry was over. He urged a radical solution of scrapping them as they were too costly to the Exchequer at £100 per man. Talbot also pointed out that a cavalryman was on duty almost twice per every week, and in fact as to the allegations of drunkenness, the Guards were a very disciplined soldiery. He quoted the Duke of Cambridge that the guards were the flower of the imperial army.

The ‘Urabi Revolt was provoked by the overthrow of Khedive Tewfik Pasha in Cairo, and the massacre of the British residents of Alexandria. The Life Guards lobbied for a return to the Waterloo system of a composite regimental system; one regimental battalion doing ceremonial duties, the other operational. The Adjutant-General to the Forces and colonel of The Blues in a famous letter of 7 July 1882 explained to Horse Guards that they could raise 450 officers and men for the Egyptian expedition, and that a squadron from each of the Household regiments would make up the force. This consisted of the two Life Guards squadrons and The Blues squadron. They were led by Lieutenant-colonel Milne Home. As the Duke of Cambridge remarked in his diary on August 1, 1882 – &quot;Went by special train to the Albert Docks to see 1st Life Guards and half the Royal Horse Guards embark in the &quot;Holland&quot;. Mr Childers went with me. All passed off well. Men in excellent spirits, and ship good and roomy&quot;. As they departed Southampton Water under the overall command of Sir Garnet Wolseley, they sent thanks to the Queen at Osborne House. On 24 August the Household Cavalry were in action for the first time. They took the towns of El Magfar, &quot;the Household troops made a fine charge with great success&quot; on 16 August, Mahsamah. At Kassassin Lock Graham held his own &quot;till the Cavalry came up and under Lowe, by moonlight, made a brilliant charge, destroying all before them, riding over 12 guns and entirely routing the Egyptians&quot;.

They were very short of food, and it was very hot. The huge British cavalrymen and horses towered over their enemy. They carried razor-sharp sabres on the 1848 steel pattern, Martini–Henry carbines, and pistols. There was a false alarm before the cavalry saw action at Mahsamah, charging &#x27;Urabi infantry, who were supported by cannon. &quot;Then the cheer we gave, then the few seconds of silence, and then the havoc and slaughter.&quot;. The Blues on the left &quot;For the first few minutes it looked as if they meant to shoot us down; and then it was our men&#x27;s turn to butcher them.&quot; (John Brocklehurst).

By 12 September 1882, Wolseley was prepared enough to plan an attack on the strongly fortified Tel-el-Kebir. He had 30,000 Sudanese and Egyptians, and 70 guns. Wolseley planned a surprise night march, and a dawn raid. On the 13th at 5 am they attacked with the Household cavalry on the right rolling up the flank, causing panic in the Egyptian ranks. They rode 60 miles in 24 hours, reaching Cairo the following day. On 20 October The Blues landed on board the &quot;Lydian Monarch&quot; to a triumphal reception at Southampton. They processed amidst cheering crowds towards Regent&#x27;s Park Barracks. The Queen was relieved Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn had returned. Both Victoria and the Prince of Wales, who was temporarily staying at Bad Homburg wrote the regiments with congratulations On 21 October Cambridge went to Regent&#x27;s Park Barracks to inspect the Squadron of the Blues. The men looked thin but in perfect health, and for the horses, though ragged, looked quite fit for work, and better than I expected&quot;. And on 25 October they were entertained to a banquet at the old Holborn Town Hall, while they stayed at Knightsbridge Barracks.

In 1884 Muhammad Ahmad, a tribal leader claiming to be the Prophet Mahdi, led a nationalist rising. General William Hicks defeated the Mahdi&#x27;s troops at Kurdufan in October 1883. But Valentine Baker was defeated by the Mahdi&#x27;s General Osman Digna near Suakin. An expedition by General Gerald Graham from Cairo won two victories at El-Teb (February 1884) and Tamai (March 1884). Wolseley was called upon to rescue General Charles George Gordon from Khartoum. But the loss of Suakin made it impossible to execute operations on the River Nile. Wolseley took the radical step of forming a Camel Corps from the Household Cavalry regiments and The Royals totalling 200 hand-picked men. He also picked a light Guards regiment as infantry. They had left Aldershot via Southampton for Alexandria by 24 September, travelling down the Nile to Aswan, and thence by Camel they reached the great bend in the Nile by Christmas. The Blues were led by a renowned officer, Fred Burnaby. &quot;The Times&quot; reported on Gordon&#x27;s plight, and Burnaby was their reporter in the Sudan. In 1884 Burnaby was wounded at El Teb. But the public were dismayed to learn that he had fought in &#x27;civvies&#x27; armed with a shot-gun. Leading the charge over the ramparts, blasting his shot-gun as he went, he was wounded in the arm, but rescued by a Highlander.

Wolseley detached the Camel Corps under Sir Herbert Stewart to march across the desert to Metemma, securing the wells at Jakdul on 12 January 1885. Having learnt how to handle camels in the saddle, they were expected to employ carbines and full kit as mounted infantry. They then had to secure more wells, and eventually encountering on foot, the enemy at Abu Klea, where 700 Mahdists charged them. The Gardner machine-gun jammed. They formed a defensive square, during which hand-to-hand fighting Burnaby fell, defended to the last by Corporal Mackintosh, who was killed. George Baillie-Hamilton, Lord Binning, the regiment&#x27;s signalling officer, crept out twice to give Burnaby water. Wave after wave of Baggara tribesmen mounted on black chargers rushed their positions, falling on volleys of rifle fire. The tactics of the square at Abu Klea exhausted the Mahdi&#x27;s best troops, who fell at that battle. Major Lord Arthur Somerset of The Blues squadron wrote commanding officer to inform him of the heroic actions. On the second occasion Burnaby had been speared. In total 9 Officers and 65 men were killed, 94 wounded in the Heavy Camel Regiment, but only one killed and four from disease among NCOs and ranks.

As the British made their way to the Nile they were constantly harassed, exhausted and thirsty. As they boarded boats Sir Herbert was killed; and his Intelligence Officer to whom command was devolved dithered. Sir Charles Wilson reached Metemma on 19 January but was not able to repair down the Nile; Gordon was killed and Khartoum taken on 26 January 1885. A tribute to their heroic commanding officer was written by Private Cameron, The Blues:

== Twentieth century warfare ==

=== Second Boer War ===
Since being made colonel of the Blues, Lord Wolseley took great care to ask the Queen permission to send a squadron from each of the three Household regiments to South Africa. In total 35,000 men left, a corps, trained at Aldershot in summer 1899 making it a foregone conclusion, they thought of a quick victory. Many of the leading officers were aristocrats. The Tugela River posed a natural boundary to the Boer republics to the north. Sir George White had unwisely tried to defend a line on a broad front, that was easily outflanked. The Boers had occupied British towns in the Cape Colony and Natal. When Redvers Buller&#x27;s expedition arrived in Cape Town Harbour in December 1899, his 30,000 troops faced a well-organized guerilla kommando of 40,000 Boer farmers. He appointed Douglas Cochrane, 12th Earl of Dundonald and Lieutenant-Colonel John Burn-Murdoch as commanders of the two cavalry brigades. The Blues found their horses were exhausted when they arrived off the train at Rensburg, near Colesberg.

On 7 January 1900 while out on patrol one officer and four men were taken prisoner by a Kommando. On 2 February they departed Rensburg at 2 pm for perfect cavalry veldt around the Modder River, where they encamped. At 11 am on 7 February, the Household Cavalry Regiment, including Royal Horse Guards horses, exhausted from the train journey, charged the Boers at Koedoesberg, manned a fence where two troopers were wounded in action. The following day the Household Cavalry Regiment left came by 10.30 am with the Blues in the advance party, rifle skirmishing with the enemy. They remained in the advance guard of Sir John French&#x27;s Cavalry Division. Three days later on 11 February they were brigaded with 10th Royal Hussars and 11th Lancers under Brigadier Robert Broadwood. That morning at 3 am they had made a great &quot;Cavalry Rush for Kimberley&quot;, using General French&#x27;s swift tactics outmanoeuvring the enemy to arrive at Ramdan. On 17 February the regiment lost twenty horses from heat exhaustion. At the Battle of Ostfontein Lord Roberts could report &quot;The fighting was practically confined to the Cavalry Division, which as usual did exceedingly well.&quot;

Ambushed by 300 Boers at Sanna&#x27;s Post, where Broadwood&#x27;s exhausted men were under canvas at 4.30 am on 31 March they into a trap: completely outnumbered by a combined force of 5,000 Boers. At 6 am General Christiaan de Wet shelled Broadwood&#x27;s encampment, before they broke and marched into an enfolding trap; sending two batteries ahead to fall into the waiting Boers lap at the Koornspruit. Only the witness of two highly experienced Brigade majors saved them. 3 miles upstream Lieutenant-Colonel Fenwick and the Blues dashed down Waterval Drift towards the spruit under heavy Boer cross-fire; Lieutenant Meade was wounded. The spring rain brought flooding to the Blues bivouacs. Later that month Colonel Thomas Pilcher&#x27;s retreat was covered by a Blues squadron and battery.

Composite Household Cavalry Regiment reinforcements consisting of two officers and 20 troopers drawn from all three Household regiments, under 1st Life Guards command had arrived at Bloemfontein on 20 April for a well earned rest, while the Blues were still bivouacked. The Blues under Sir John French were left on the road: the line of retreat was blocked by de Wet, who moved to cut off the convoys sent along the Thaba Nchu-Bloemfontein Road. Still in Broadwood&#x27;s brigade, the Household Cavalry Regiment marched to Krantz Kraal to join an infantry brigade and divisional commander Major-General Ian Hamilton who marched on 30 April. During the night 4th Cavalry brigade was sent up as reinforcement and the Boers now heavily outnumbered by Broadwoood on the flank, beat a hasty retreat on 1 May, but not before inflicting heavy casualties on the cavalry. These brilliant marches covered hundreds of miles, such as the latter from Kaalfontein to Blesberg. But the next month another 300 miles would be traversed interspersed with episodic periods of fierce fighting. On 3 May Broadwood despatched a squadron led by Arthur Gore, Viscount Sudley, a captain in the Royal Horse Guards to gallop to exploit between two converging enemy forces of 4,000 and 1,000 men respectively over the Brandfort Ridge through a gauntlet of fire left and right. Lieutenant Rose was a casualty. The decisive action drove off the Boer infantry and enabled Broadwood to capture Welkom Farm on the Vet River the following day. Charles Wyndham, also a lieutenant, attached to the Blues, but initially a Life Guard was wounded in the skirmish at Kopje. On 10 May the Blues detachment under Colonel Fenwick bivouacked in the east of Ventersburg township, Two days later French&#x27;s Winburg Column was able wheel round to capture the Boer HQ at Kroonstad with 1st and 4th Cavalry brigades. On 5 June the Household Cavalry Regiment occupied Poort north of Pretoria in an advanced position ahead of brigade. Roberts and Hamilton insisted on an arduous march in which the army lost 9,000 men, falling disproportionately on the Cavalry who lost 30% of their strength in 34 days.

On 15 August racing at top speed with the Household Cavalry Regiment Lord Kitchener caught the Boers at Elands Camp in the middle of the night, relieving the besieged town of Brakfontein in an expert cavalry manoeuvre; they relieved again at Banks Station a week later, before marching on to Krugersdorp. The enemy&#x27;s operations around Pretoria were abandoned by the time the Household Cavalry Regiment entered the city on 30 August having traversed 1,200 miles in four months.

During September 1900 the cavalry were involved in chasing down the Boer General de Wet&#x27;s army. They held the pass at Olifant&#x27;s Nek in the Magaliesberg mountains, just as Lord Kitchener was about to encircle and finish off the enemy&#x27;s force of 2,600 Boer kommando. But Major-General Sir Ian Hamilton ordered them to leave their positions and de Wet escaped. In his journal, Captain Meade exonerated Major-General Hamilton for any blame attached to de Wet&#x27;s escape through Olifant&#x27;s Nek, where he hid out in the mountains until returning southwards weeks later. Broadwood left the command on 19 October thanking them for all their &#x27;hard work&#x27;, &quot;they always did well anything I asked them to do...&quot;

The brigade was stationed to Rustenberg on September, where Colonel Fenwick was named commandant. Boer convoys in the district were rounded up, vast supplies were seized at Kaffirs Kraal and, taken to the town, where food was distributed. Sweeping north Broadwood closed the gap in the line meeting Clements at Commando Nek. At last the call came for the regiment to move to Pretoria ready for disembarkation. At the end of October they entrained for Cape Town, bound for Southampton on the &quot;Hawarden Castle&quot;. The Blues returned on 30 November to their barracks at Regent&#x27;s Park. Meanwhile, in India, the lifestyle of soldiers had changed little since the Cardwell reforms. And the pay in 1910, for example, for a lieutenant was still only £230 per annum, whereas the average mess bill was £300. The common ground lay in the fact that officers men were drawn largely from agricultural communities.

In a famous judgement known as the Esher Award, Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher, Master of the Rolls, awarded precedence to the Household Cavalry over the Foot Guards (Grenadier Guards), although their colonel was known as &quot;in brigade waiting&quot;, Esher found for the cavalry. The matter was then passed to Conservative Lord Chancellor Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury who decided it was up to the King.

=== First World War ===
====Mobilisation====

When war broke out the regiment was at Combermere Barracks, Windsor (renamed after Clewer was demolished and rebuilt). One squadron came under the order of the Household Cavalry Composite Regiment. The regiment landed at Zeebrugge as part of the 7th Cavalry Brigade in the 3rd Cavalry Division in October 1914 for service on the Western Front.

On 30 October the Blues were operating in the zone around the village of Zanvoorde when the Germans attacked. On 20 November the Cavalry Corps had joined up with Edmund Allenby&#x27;s Division in the Ypres Salient, a front line that went east of Zonnebeke, around Polygon Wood, over the Menin Road (the road from Ypres to Menin) and then west of Zanvoorde towards Wytchaete and Messines. From whence the Composite regiment (Life Guards 1 and 2) resisted an offensive on 31 October. A French cavalry brigade was sent east of Hooge as a dismounted detachment in support of 7th Cavalry Brigade at 5 pm. The action had begun on 25 October when the Blues staging a daring operation covered the retreat of 20th Infantry brigade, on horseback. They galloped out to draw German shell fire. On 21 November the Royal Horse Guards were moved to the 8th Cavalry Brigade, which had only been formed the previous day. On 26 December 1914, Sir Douglas Haig, a cavalry officer, took command of the 1st Army.

In 1916 a Welshman, Colwyn Philipps, a captain of the Blues, was killed in action. Shortly afterwards his poetry was released by Rupert Brooke. His simple prosody such as &quot;An Outsider&quot; and &quot;A friend&quot; and &quot;Sesame and Lilies&quot;, said to be in the style of Robert Browning, were symbolic of an innocence of youth on horseback cut down in his prime, lost to his father.

====Machine Gun Regiment====
On 7 November 1917 the Blues were moved back to 7th Cavalry Brigade, as one of the few regiments that remained mounted. In February 1918 it was decided to reduce the cavalry by two divisions, to just three divisions. The two former Indian army cavalry divisional corps were sent from France to the Middle Eastern front, and 3rd Cavalry Division was extensively reorganized. One cavalry division in France was disbanded altogether. The decision was taken to convert the Yeomanry regiment and Household Cavalry into battalions of the Guards Machine Gun Regiment. They would be posted to the pillboxes that peppered the landscape along the trench front, once trained at Camiers Machine Gun School, north of Etaples. Haig remarked &quot;They seemed a splendid lot of officers...&quot; They were &quot;selected officers&quot; chosen as skilled and experienced soldiers tasked to stop an &quot;en masse&quot; onslaught of German Stormtroopers. They were inserted with the intention of causing minimum disruption to the infantry of the line regiments. In March 1918 the 3rd Cavalry division moved to 1st Army. Field Marshal Haig was the old commander of his 1st Army Corps, whose own experience of cavalry regiments in South Africa and India regarded the Household Cavalry as more ceremonial and over-privileged:

Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Kavanagh wrote about the changes although he regretted them, when he had advocated the move to machine guns. Colonel of the Blues, Sir Evelyn Wood, wrote to Kavanagh: &quot;You can picture my pleasant thoughts when I contrast the spirit of the Blues turning to the duties of Machine Gunners, and the false swagger of the men ... in the Light Dragoons&quot;.

In March 1918, the Germans broke through Hubert Gough&#x27;s Fifth Army lines and penetrated at least 5 miles, for the first time since 1914. It was clear the Allied offensive would soon follow the faltering German advance, the 3rd Cavalry Division moved to the 1st Army, just as it was about to be dismounted. On 3 March, Field Marshal Haig had written to Kavanagh explaining that:

At Villeselve some horsemen from the Royals, Dragoon Guards and 10th Hussars saw some infantry in the sunken lanes &quot;The Germans had taken up what positions they could in the open&quot;, and wheeling round made, what was the last cavalry manoeuvre of its kind in Europe. As many as 70–100 enemy soldiers were killed by sabres. In 1918 the regiment remounted on horses and were part of Edmund Allenby&#x27;s army in Palestine mainly engaged in reconnaissance. On 20 May 1918, Haig went to see Major General Cyril Deverell commanding 3rd Division, who complained of the lack of trained officers for battalion and company commanders in the fighting south of Arras and north of the Lys.

====Hundred days====
On 8 August 1918, Haig&#x27;s &quot;100 Days&quot; began in front of Amiens when he ordered the attack that by the time of the Armistice had taken the allies to the German border. But cavalry actions were heavily restricted due to the crater-pocked landscape of shell holes lined with barbed wire presenting &quot;a death trap&quot; to horses. White-Spunner calls the offensive &quot;one of the most sophisticated ever mounted by the British Army, which saw for the first time the coordinated use of tanks, aircraft, cavalry and infantry&quot;. In the past Haig had not got along with Sir Henry Wilson, but in the Hundred Days and later, Wilson was effusive in his praise of the Commander-in-Chief. As well as greater care shown to troops, the Great War years were most innovative of new technology, one of the most significant being the Stokes mortar. As early as Spring 1916, Haig was using cavalry in a sophisticated way, as part of an all-arms striking force, and in the looser warfare of the Hundred Days cavalry was an indispensable part of his range of resources.

The Blues were located on the Sambre–Oise Canal and, on 4 November the last major British offensive took place. It was foggy weather enabling the men to get across the canal unseen along high hedged lanes. With no Germans to hold them back, all the reserves being committed, the attack advanced without further resistance. On 5 November, Haig offered Julian Byng and Henry Rawlinson Cavalry Corps to be used in an advance in the direction of Maubeuge, but they both refused. The French however, the following day were much more positive about using cavalry to force the River Scheldt. On 9 November, William Birdwood&#x27;s Fifth Army cavalry received orders to cross the Scheldt, as the enemy was in full retreat. As the speed of advance accelerated more cavalry was required to join battle. On 11 November at 11 am Haig had a meeting with all commanders at Cambrai, including General Kavanagh, when the Armistice already signed at 5 am, actually came into force. One Blues officer spoke of their emotional sentiments when finally the Armistice was called – and the silence.

=== Inter-War Years ===

On 10 February 1919 the household cavalry was reorganized and permanently stationed in London throughout the inter-war period. On 22 March 1919, the Household Cavalry in drab khaki, marched past King George V at Buckingham Palace. On 19 April a requiem was held at Westminster Abbey. The 1st Life Guards went to Knightsbridge Barracks, the 2nd Life Guards were at Combermere Barracks, and the Blues were sent to Regent&#x27;s Park Barracks. In May 1921, they adopted the old rotation system again, but it only lasted for one year and they were back to permanent barracks. As memories of the war melted away, the regiments lost their separate identities in civilian life. In the reorganisations that followed the First World War, the 1st Life Guards and the 2nd Life Guards were amalgamated as &quot;The Life Guards (1st and 2nd)&quot; in 1922. Lord Allenby was colonel of 1st Life Guards and Sir Cecil Edward Bingham was colonel of the 2nd Life Guards. This arrangement continued until the regiment was renamed &quot;The Life Guards&quot; in 1928.

The two Household regiments rotated the barracks between Combermere Barracks and Regent&#x27;s Park barracks, and then when Regent&#x27;s Park Barracks became too cramped, from 1932, between Combermere Barracks and Knightsbridge Barracks. In 1938 the Household Cavalry were ordered to Palestine still mounted as cavalry and still actively engaged in ceremonial duties but did not arrive in Palestine until 1939.

=== Second World War ===
The Blues were at Windsor when war was declared on 3 September 1939. That month, The Life Guards and Royal Horse Guards formed the Household Cavalry Composite Regiment and the Household Cavalry Training Regiment. The Household Cavalry Composite Regiment, which saw action in Palestine, Iraq and North Africa, disbanded in 1945 and the personnel returned to their original units.

===Post-war===
After the war the Royal Horse Guards was based at Brühl in Germany and only moved back to Combermere Barracks in March 1952. It deployed to Cyprus in February 1956, returned to Combermere Barracks in May 1959 and then moved to Harewood Barracks in Herford in October 1962. It returned to Combermere Barracks again in June 1966 and transferred to Hobart Barracks in Detmold in November 1968. The regiment amalgamated with the Royal Dragoons (1st Dragoons) to form the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in 1969.

<text>The Rush–Bagot Treaty or Rush–Bagot Disarmament was a treaty between the United States and Great Britain limiting naval armaments on the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, following the War of 1812. It was ratified by the United States Senate on April 16, 1818, and was confirmed by Canada, following Confederation in 1867.

The treaty provided for a large demilitarization of lakes along the international boundary, where many British naval arrangements and forts remained. The treaty stipulated that the United States and British North America could each maintain one military vessel (no more than 100 tons burden) as well as one cannon (no more than eighteen pounds) on Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain. The remaining Great Lakes permitted the United States and British North America to keep two military vessels &quot;of like burden&quot; on the waters armed with &quot;like force&quot;. The treaty, and the separate Treaty of 1818, laid the basis for a demilitarized boundary between the U.S. and British North America.

==History==
The origins of the Rush–Bagot Treaty can be traced to a correspondence of letters between Acting United States Secretary of State Richard Rush and the British Minister to Washington Sir Charles Bagot, which were exchanged and signed on April 27 and 28, 1817. After the terms of the notes were agreed upon by Rush and Bagot, the Rush–Bagot Agreement was unofficially recognized by both countries. On April 6, 1818, it was submitted to the United States Senate and formally ratified on April 16, 1818. The treaty eventually led to the Treaty of Washington of 1871, which completed disarmament. The United States and Canada agreed in 1946, through an exchange of diplomatic notes, that the stationing of naval vessels for training purposes was permissible provided each government was fully notified in advance.

In 2004, the U.S. Coast Guard decided to arm 11 of its small cutters stationed on Lake Erie and Lake Huron with M240 7.62 mm machine guns. The U.S. decision was based on a climbing number of smuggling operations as well as the increased threat of terrorist activity after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The Canadian government decided that the armament did not violate the treaty, as the guns were to be used for law enforcement rather than military activities. Canada reserved the right to arm its law enforcement vessels with similar weapons.

==Military installations==
HMCS &quot;Stone Frigate&quot;, located at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, was constructed during 1820 to store part of the dismantled British fleet from the War of 1812, which had been dismantled pursuant to the Rush–Bagot Treaty.

There are still military facilities near or next to the Great Lakes:

==Outcome==
The Canada–United States border was demilitarized, including the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. The U.S. and the British agreed to joint control over the Oregon Territory. The Rush–Bagot Agreement laid the foundation for the world&#x27;s longest international boundary—8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), and the longest demilitarized border in the world.

Although the treaty had caused difficulties during World War I, its terms were not changed. Similar problems occurred before World War II, but Secretary of State Cordell Hull wanted to preserve the agreement because of its historical importance. In 1939 and 1940, Canada and the United States agreed to interpret the treaty so that weapons could be installed in the Great Lakes but could not be operable until the ships left the Lakes. In 1942, the United States, by then having entered the war and allied with Canada, successfully proposed that until the end of the war weapons could be completely installed and tested in the Lakes. After discussions in the Permanent Joint Board on Defense, in 1946, Canada similarly proposed to interpret the agreement as permitting using ships for training purposes if each country notified the other.

==Plaques==
An Ontario Heritage Trust plaque in Kingston, Ontario recognizes the Rush–Bagot Agreement 
(). A plaque also stands at the former site of the British Legation in Washington, D.C. () where the agreement was negotiated. A monument stands on the grounds of Old Fort Niagara as well 
(), featuring reliefs of both Rush and Bagot, as well as the words of the treaty.

<text>New Horizons is an interplanetary space probe launched as a part of NASA&#x27;s New Frontiers program. Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), with a team led by Alan Stern, the spacecraft was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system in 2015, and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, which became a mission to 486958 Arrokoth. It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System.

On January 19, 2006, &quot;New Horizons&quot; was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about . It was the fastest (average speed with respect to Earth) human-made object ever launched from Earth. It is not the fastest speed recorded for a spacecraft, which, as of 2023, is that of the Parker Solar Probe. After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, &quot;New Horizons&quot; proceeded to Jupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of . The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ speed; the flyby also enabled a general test of &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet&#x27;s atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere.

Most of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve onboard systems, except for brief annual checkouts. On December 6, 2014, &quot;New Horizons&quot; was brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began. On January 15, 2015, the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto.

On July 14, 2015, at 11:49 UTC, it flew above the surface of Pluto, which at the time was 34 AU from the Sun, making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet. In August 2016, &quot;New Horizons&quot; was reported to have traveled at speeds of more than . On October 25, 2016, at 21:48 UTC, the last recorded data from the Pluto flyby was received from &quot;New Horizons&quot;. Having completed its flyby of Pluto, &quot;New Horizons&quot; then maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth (then nicknamed &quot;Ultima Thule&quot;), which occurred on January 1, 2019, when it was from the Sun. In August 2018, NASA cited results by &quot;Alice&quot; on &quot;New Horizons&quot; to confirm the existence of a &quot;hydrogen wall&quot; at the outer edges of the Solar System. This &quot;wall&quot; was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft. 

New Horizons is traveling through the Kuiper belt; it is from Earth and from the Sun as of February 2025. NASA has announced it is to extend operations for &quot;New Horizons&quot; until the spacecraft exits the Kuiper belt, which is expected to occur between 2028 and 2029. 
== History ==

In August 1992, JPL scientist Robert Staehle called Pluto discoverer Clyde Tombaugh, requesting permission to visit his planet. &quot;I told him he was welcome to it,&quot; Tombaugh later remembered, &quot;though he&#x27;s got to go one long, cold trip.&quot; The call eventually led to a series of proposed Pluto missions leading up to &quot;New Horizons&quot;.

Stamatios &quot;Tom&quot; Krimigis, head of the Applied Physics Laboratory&#x27;s space division, one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition, formed the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team with Alan Stern in December 2000. Appointed as the project&#x27;s principal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as &quot;the personification of the Pluto mission&quot;. &quot;New Horizons&quot; was based largely on Stern&#x27;s work since &quot;Pluto 350&quot; and involved most of the team from &quot;Pluto Kuiper Express&quot;.

The &quot;New Horizons&quot; proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA. It was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study in June 2001. The other finalist, POSSE (Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer), was a separate but similar Pluto mission concept by the University of Colorado Boulder, led by principal investigator Larry W. Esposito, and supported by the JPL, Lockheed Martin and the University of California.

However, the APL, in addition to being supported by &quot;Pluto Kuiper Express&quot; developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University were at an advantage; they had recently developed &quot;NEAR Shoemaker&quot; for NASA, which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier that year, and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare.

In November 2001, &quot;New Horizons&quot; was officially selected for funding as part of the New Frontiers program. However, the new NASA Administrator appointed by the Bush administration, Sean O&#x27;Keefe, was not supportive of &quot;New Horizons&quot; and effectively canceled it by not including it in NASA&#x27;s budget for 2003. NASA&#x27;s Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, Ed Weiler, prompted Stern to lobby for the funding of &quot;New Horizons&quot; in hopes of the mission appearing in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, a prioritized &quot;wish list,&quot; compiled by the United States National Research Council, that reflects the opinions of the scientific community.

After an intense campaign to gain support for &quot;New Horizons&quot;, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey of 2003–2013 was published in the summer of 2002. &quot;New Horizons&quot; topped the list of projects considered the highest priority among the scientific community in the medium-size category; ahead of missions to the Moon, and even Jupiter. Weiler stated that it was a result that &quot;[his] administration was not going to fight&quot;. Funding for the mission was finally secured following the publication of the report. Stern&#x27;s team was finally able to start building the spacecraft and its instruments, with a planned launch in January 2006 and arrival at Pluto in 2015. Alice Bowman became Mission Operations Manager (MOM).

== Mission profile ==
&quot;New Horizons&quot; is the first mission in NASA&#x27;s New Frontiers mission category, larger and more expensive than the Discovery missions but smaller than the missions of the Flagship Program. The cost of the mission, including spacecraft and instrument development, launch vehicle, mission operations, data analysis, and education/public outreach, is approximately $700 million over 15 years (2001–2016). The spacecraft was built primarily by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The mission&#x27;s principal investigator is Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute (formerly NASA Associate Administrator).

After separation from the launch vehicle, overall control was taken by Mission Operations Center (MOC) at the Applied Physics Laboratory in Howard County, Maryland. The science instruments are operated at Clyde Tombaugh Science Operations Center (T-SOC) in Boulder, Colorado. Navigation is performed at various contractor facilities, whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station through Headquarters NASA and JPL.

KinetX is the lead on the &quot;New Horizons&quot; navigation team and is responsible for planning trajectory adjustments as the spacecraft speeds toward the outer Solar System. Coincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto&#x27;s moon Charon. The Naval Observatory itself is not far from the Lowell Observatory where Pluto was discovered.

&quot;New Horizons&quot; was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the Solar System. When the spacecraft was launched, Pluto was still classified as a planet, later to be reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Some members of the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet. Pluto&#x27;s satellites Nix and Hydra also have a connection with the spacecraft: the first letters of their names (N and H) are the initials of &quot;New Horizons&quot;. The moons&#x27; discoverers chose these names for this reason, plus Nix and Hydra&#x27;s relationship to the mythological Pluto.

===Mementos===
In addition to the science equipment, there are nine cultural artifacts traveling with the spacecraft. These include a collection of 434,738 names stored on a compact disc, a collection of images of New Horizons project personnel on another CD, a piece of Scaled Composites&#x27;s &quot;SpaceShipOne&quot;, a &quot;Not Yet Explored&quot; USPS stamp, and two copies of the Flag of the United States.

About of Clyde Tombaugh&#x27;s ashes are aboard the spacecraft, to commemorate his discovery of Pluto in 1930. A Florida state quarter coin, whose design commemorates human exploration, is included, officially as a trim weight, as is a Maryland state quarter to honor the probe&#x27;s builders. One of the science packages (a dust counter) is named after Venetia Burney, who, as a child, suggested the name &quot;Pluto&quot; after its discovery.

== Goal ==

The goal of the mission is to understand the formation of the Plutonian system, the Kuiper belt, and the transformation of the early Solar System. The spacecraft collected data on the atmospheres, surfaces, interiors, and environments of Pluto and its moons. It will also study other objects in the Kuiper belt. &quot;By way of comparison, &quot;New Horizons&quot; gathered 5,000 times as much data at Pluto as Mariner did at the Red Planet.&quot;

Some of the questions the mission attempts to answer are: What is Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere made of and how does it behave? What does its surface look like? Are there large geological structures? How do solar wind particles interact with Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere?

Specifically, the mission&#x27;s science objectives are to:

*Map the surface compositions of Pluto and Charon
*Characterize the geologies and morphologies of Pluto and Charon
*Characterize the neutral atmosphere of Pluto and its escape rate
*Search for an atmosphere around Charon
*Map surface temperatures on Pluto and Charon
*Search for rings and additional satellites around Pluto
*Conduct similar investigations of one or more Kuiper belt objects

== Design and construction ==

=== Spacecraft subsystems ===

The spacecraft is comparable in size and general shape to a grand piano and has been compared to a piano glued to a cocktail bar-sized satellite dish. As a point of departure, the team took inspiration from the Ulysses spacecraft, which also carried a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) and dish on a box-in-box structure through the outer Solar System. Many subsystems and components have flight heritage from APL&#x27;s CONTOUR spacecraft, which in turn had heritage from APL&#x27;s TIMED spacecraft.

&quot;New Horizons&quot;″ body forms a triangle, almost thick. (The &quot;Pioneers&quot; have hexagonal bodies, whereas the &quot;Voyagers&quot;, &quot;Galileo&quot;, and &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; have decagonal, hollow bodies.) A 7075 aluminium alloy tube forms the main structural column, between the launch vehicle adapter ring at the &quot;rear&quot;, and the radio dish antenna affixed to the &quot;front&quot; flat side. The titanium fuel tank is in this tube. The RTG attaches with a 4-sided titanium mount resembling a gray pyramid or stepstool.

Titanium provides strength and thermal isolation. The rest of the triangle is primarily sandwich panels of thin aluminum face sheet (less than ) bonded to aluminum honeycomb core. The structure is larger than strictly necessary, with empty space inside. The structure is designed to act as shielding, reducing electronics errors caused by radiation from the RTG. Also, the mass distribution required for a spinning spacecraft demands a wider triangle.

The interior structure is painted black to equalize temperature by radiative heat transfer. Overall, the spacecraft is thoroughly blanketed to retain heat. Unlike the &quot;Pioneers&quot; and &quot;Voyagers&quot;, the radio dish is also enclosed in blankets that extend to the body. The heat from the RTG adds warmth to the spacecraft while it is in the outer Solar System. While in the inner Solar System, the spacecraft must prevent overheating, hence electronic activity is limited, power is diverted to shunts with attached radiators, and louvers are opened to radiate excess heat. While the spacecraft is cruising inactively in the cold outer Solar System, the louvers are closed, and the shunt regulator reroutes power to electric heaters.

==== Propulsion and attitude control ====
&quot;New Horizons&quot; has both spin-stabilized (cruise) and three-axis stabilized (science) modes controlled entirely with hydrazine monopropellant. Additional post launch delta-&quot;v&quot; of over is provided by a internal tank. Helium is used as a pressurant, with an elastomeric diaphragm assisting expulsion. The spacecraft&#x27;s on-orbit mass including fuel is over on the Jupiter flyby trajectory, but would have been only for the backup direct flight option to Pluto. Significantly, had the backup option been taken, this would have meant less fuel for later Kuiper belt operations.

There are 16 thrusters on &quot;New Horizons&quot;: four and twelve plumbed into redundant branches. The larger thrusters are used primarily for trajectory corrections, and the small ones (previously used on &quot;Cassini&quot; and the &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft) are used primarily for attitude control and spinup/spindown maneuvers. Two star cameras are used to measure the spacecraft attitude. They are mounted on the face of the spacecraft and provide attitude information while in spin-stabilized or 3-axis mode. In between the time of star camera readings, spacecraft orientation is provided by dual redundant miniature inertial measurement units. Each unit contains three solid-state gyroscopes and three accelerometers. Two Adcole Sun sensors provide attitude determination. One detects the angle to the Sun, whereas the other measures spin rate and clocking.

==== Power ====
A cylindrical radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) protrudes in the plane of the triangle from one vertex of the triangle. The RTG provided of power at launch, and was predicted to drop approximately every year, decaying to by the time of its encounter with the Plutonian system in 2015 and will decay too far to power the transmitters in the 2030s. There are no onboard batteries since RTG output is predictable, and load transients are handled by a capacitor bank and fast circuit breakers. As of January 2019, the power output of the RTG is about .

The RTG, model &quot;GPHS-RTG&quot;, was originally a spare from the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission. The RTG contains of plutonium-238 oxide pellets. Each pellet is clad in iridium, then encased in a graphite shell. It was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy at the Materials and Fuels Complex, a part of the Idaho National Laboratory.
The original RTG design called for of plutonium, but a unit less powerful than the original design goal was produced because of delays at the United States Department of Energy, including security activities, that delayed plutonium production. The mission parameters and observation sequence had to be modified for the reduced wattage; still, not all instruments can operate simultaneously. The Department of Energy transferred the space battery program from Ohio to Argonne in 2002 because of security concerns.

The amount of radioactive plutonium in the RTG is about one-third the amount on board the Cassini–Huygens probe when it launched in 1997. The Cassini launch had been protested by multiple organizations, due to the risk of such a large amount of plutonium being released into the atmosphere in case of an accident. The United States Department of Energy estimated the chances of a launch accident that would release radiation into the atmosphere at 1 in 350, and monitored the launch because of the inclusion of an RTG on board. It was estimated that a worst-case scenario of total dispersal of on-board plutonium would spread the equivalent radiation of 80% the average annual dosage in North America from background radiation over an area with a radius of .

==== Flight computer ====
The spacecraft carries two computer systems: the Command and Data Handling system and the Guidance and Control processor. Each of the two systems is duplicated for redundancy, for a total of four computers. The processor used for its flight computers is the Mongoose-V, a 12 MHz radiation-hardened version of the MIPS R3000 CPU. Multiple redundant clocks and timing routines are implemented in hardware and software to help prevent faults and downtime. To conserve heat and mass, spacecraft and instrument electronics are housed together in IEMs (integrated electronics modules). There are two redundant IEMs. Including other functions such as instrument and radio electronics, each IEM contains 9 boards. The software of the probe runs on Nucleus RTOS operating system.

There have been two &quot;safing&quot; events, that sent the spacecraft into safe mode:
* On March 19, 2007, the Command and Data Handling computer experienced an uncorrectable memory error and rebooted itself, causing the spacecraft to go into safe mode. The craft fully recovered within two days, with some data loss on Jupiter&#x27;s magnetotail. No impact on the subsequent mission was expected.
* On July 4, 2015, there was a CPU safing event triggered by an over-assignment of commanded science operations on the craft&#x27;s approach to Pluto. Fortunately, the craft was able to recover within two days without major impacts on its mission. NASA scientists therefore reduced the number of scientific operations on the craft to prevent future events, which could happen during the approach with Pluto.

==== Telecommunications and data handling ====
Communication with the spacecraft is via X band. The craft had a communication rate of at Jupiter; at Pluto&#x27;s distance, a rate of approximately per transmitter was expected. Besides the low data rate, Pluto&#x27;s distance also causes a latency of about 4.5 hours (one-way). The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) dishes are used to relay commands once the spacecraft is beyond Jupiter. The spacecraft uses dual modular redundancy transmitters and receivers, and either right- or left-hand circular polarization.

The downlink signal is amplified by dual redundant 12-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) mounted on the body under the dish. The receivers are low-power designs. The system can be controlled to power both TWTAs at the same time, and transmit a dual-polarized downlink signal to the DSN that nearly doubles the downlink rate. DSN tests early in the mission with this dual polarization combining technique were successful, and the capability was declared to be operational (when the spacecraft power budget permits both TWTAs to be powered).

In addition to the high-gain antenna, there are two backup low-gain antennas and a medium-gain dish. The high-gain dish has a Cassegrain reflector layout, composite construction, of diameter providing over of gain and a half-power beam width of about a degree. The prime-focus medium-gain antenna, with a aperture and 10° half-power beam width, is mounted to the forward-facing side of the high-gain antenna&#x27;s secondary reflector. The forward low-gain antenna is stacked atop the feed of the medium-gain antenna. The aft low-gain antenna is mounted within the launch adapter at the rear of the spacecraft. This antenna was used only for early mission phases near Earth, just after launch and for emergencies if the spacecraft had lost attitude control.

&quot;New Horizons&quot; recorded scientific instrument data to its solid-state memory buffer at each encounter, then transmitted the data to Earth. Data storage is done on two low-power solid-state recorders (one primary, one backup) holding up to s each. Because of the extreme distance from Pluto and the Kuiper belt, only one buffer load at those encounters can be saved. This is because &quot;New Horizons&quot; would require approximately 16 months after leaving the vicinity of Pluto to transmit the buffer load back to Earth. At Pluto&#x27;s distance, radio signals from the space probe back to Earth took four hours and 25 minutes to traverse 4.7 billion km of space.

Part of the reason for the delay between the gathering of and transmission of data is that all of the &quot;New Horizons&quot; instrumentation is body-mounted. In order for the cameras to record data, the entire probe must turn, and the one-degree-wide beam of the high-gain antenna was not pointing toward Earth. Previous spacecraft, such as the &quot;Voyager&quot; program probes, had a rotatable instrumentation platform (a &quot;scan platform&quot;) that could take measurements from virtually any angle without losing radio contact with Earth. &quot;New Horizons&quot; was mechanically simplified to save weight, shorten the schedule, and improve reliability during its 15-year designed lifetime.

The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; scan platform jammed at Saturn, and the demands of long time exposures at outer planets led to a change of plans such that the entire probe was rotated to make photos at Uranus and Neptune, similar to how &quot;New Horizons&quot; rotated.

== Instruments ==
&quot;New Horizons&quot; carries seven instruments: three optical instruments, two plasma instruments, a dust sensor and a radio science receiver/radiometer. The instruments are to be used to investigate the global geology, surface composition, surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature and escape rate of Pluto and its moons. The rated power is , though not all instruments operate simultaneously. In addition, &quot;New Horizons&quot; has an Ultrastable Oscillator subsystem, which may be used to study and test the Pioneer anomaly towards the end of the spacecraft&#x27;s life.

=== Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) ===
The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is a long-focal-length imager designed for high resolution and responsivity at visible wavelengths. The instrument is equipped with a 1024×1024 pixel by 12-bits-per-pixel monochromatic CCD imager giving a resolution of 5 μrad (~1 arcsec). The CCD is chilled far below freezing by a passive radiator on the antisolar face of the spacecraft. This temperature differential requires insulation and isolation from the rest of the structure. The aperture Ritchey–Chretien mirrors and metering structure are made of silicon carbide to boost stiffness, reduce weight and prevent warping at low temperatures. The optical elements sit in a composite light shield and mount with titanium and fiberglass for thermal isolation. Overall mass is , with the optical tube assembly (OTA) weighing about , for one of the largest silicon-carbide telescopes flown at the time (now surpassed by Herschel). For viewing on public web sites the 12-bit per pixel LORRI images are converted to 8-bit per pixel JPEG images. These public images do not contain the full dynamic range of brightness information available from the raw LORRI images files.

=== Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) ===
Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) is a toroidal electrostatic analyzer and retarding potential analyzer (RPA), that makes up one of the two instruments comprising &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ Plasma and high-energy particle spectrometer suite (PAM), the other being PEPSSI. SWAP measures particles of up to 6.5 keV and, because of the tenuous solar wind at Pluto&#x27;s distance, the instrument is designed with the largest aperture of any such instrument ever flown.

=== Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI) ===

Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI) is a time of flight ion and electron sensor that makes up one of the two instruments comprising &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ plasma and high-energy particle spectrometer suite (PAM), the other being SWAP. Unlike SWAP, which measures particles of up to 6.5 keV, PEPSSI goes up to 1 MeV. The PEPSSI sensor has been designed to measure the mass, energy and distribution of charged particles around Pluto, and is also able to differentiate between protons, electrons, and other heavy ions.

=== Alice ===

&quot;Alice&quot; is an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer that is one of two photographic instruments comprising &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation (PERSI); the other being the &quot;Ralph&quot; telescope. It resolves 1,024 wavelength bands in the far and extreme ultraviolet (from 50–), over 32 view fields. Its goal is to determine the composition of Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere. This Alice instrument is derived from another Alice aboard ESA&#x27;s Rosetta spacecraft. The instrument has a mass of 4.4 kg and draws 4.4 watts of power. Its primary role is to determine the relative concentrations of various elements and isotopes in Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere.
In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by &quot;Alice&quot; on the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft, a &quot;hydrogen wall&quot; at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft.

=== Ralph telescope ===
The Ralph telescope, 75 mm in aperture, is one of two photographic instruments that make up &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation (PERSI), with the other being the Alice instrument. Ralph has two separate channels: MVIC (Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera), a visible-light CCD imager with broadband and color channels; and LEISA (Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array), a near-infrared imaging spectrometer. LEISA is derived from a similar instrument on the Earth Observing-1 spacecraft. Ralph was named after Alice&#x27;s husband on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, and was designed after Alice.

On June 23, 2017, NASA announced that it has renamed the LEISA instrument to the &quot;Lisa Hardaway Infrared Mapping Spectrometer&quot; in honor of Lisa Hardaway, the Ralph program manager at Ball Aerospace, who died in January 2017 at age 50.

=== Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (VBSDC) ===
The Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (VBSDC), built by students at the University of Colorado Boulder, is operating periodically to make dust measurements. It consists of a detector panel, about , mounted on the anti-solar face of the spacecraft (the ram direction), and an electronics box within the spacecraft. The detector contains fourteen polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) panels, twelve science and two reference, which generate voltage when impacted. Effective collecting area is . No dust counter has operated past the orbit of Uranus; models of dust in the outer Solar System, especially the Kuiper belt, are speculative. The VBSDC is always turned on measuring the masses of the interplanetary and interstellar dust particles (in the range of nano- and picograms) as they collide with the PVDF panels mounted on the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft. The measured data is expected to greatly contribute to the understanding of the dust spectra of the Solar System. The dust spectra can then be compared with those from observations of other stars, giving new clues as to where Earth-like planets can be found in the universe. The dust counter is named for Venetia Burney, who first suggested the name &quot;Pluto&quot; at the age of 11. A thirteen-minute short film about the VBSDC garnered an Emmy Award for student achievement in 2006.

=== Radio Science Experiment (REX) ===

The Radio Science Experiment (REX) used an ultrastable crystal oscillator (essentially a calibrated crystal in a miniature oven) and some additional electronics to conduct radio science investigations using the communications channels. These are small enough to fit on a single card. Because there are two redundant communications subsystems, there are two, identical REX circuit boards.


== Journey to Pluto ==
=== Launch ===
On September 24, 2005, the spacecraft arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on board a C-17 Globemaster III for launch preparations. The launch of &quot;New Horizons&quot; was originally scheduled for January 11, 2006, but was initially delayed until January 17, 2006, to allow for borescope inspections of the Atlas V&#x27;s kerosene tank. Further delays related to low cloud ceiling conditions downrange, and high winds and technical difficulties—unrelated to the rocket itself—prevented launch for a further two days.

The probe finally lifted off from Pad 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, directly south of Space Shuttle Launch Complex 39, at 19:00 UTC on January 19, 2006. The Centaur second stage ignited at 19:04:43 UTC and burned for 5 minutes 25 seconds. It reignited at 19:32 UTC and burned for 9 minutes 47 seconds. The ATK Star 48B third stage ignited at 19:42:37 UTC and burned for 1 minute 28 seconds. Combined, these burns successfully sent the probe on a solar-escape trajectory at . &quot;New Horizons&quot; took only nine hours to pass the Moon&#x27;s orbit. Although there were backup launch opportunities in February 2006 and February 2007, only the first twenty-three days of the 2006 window permitted the Jupiter flyby. Any launch outside that period would have forced the spacecraft to fly a slower trajectory directly to Pluto, delaying its encounter by five to six years.

The probe was launched by a Lockheed Martin Atlas V 551 rocket, with a third stage added to increase the heliocentric (escape) speed. This was the first launch of the Atlas V 551 configuration, which uses five solid rocket boosters, and the first Atlas V with a third stage. Previous flights had used zero, two, or three solid boosters, but never five. The vehicle, AV-010, weighed at lift-off, and had earlier been slightly damaged when Hurricane Wilma swept across Florida on October 24, 2005. One of the solid rocket boosters was hit by a door. The booster was replaced with an identical unit, rather than inspecting and requalifying the original.

The launch was dedicated to the memory of launch conductor Daniel Sarokon, who was described by space program officials as one of the most influential people in the history of space travel.

=== Inner Solar System ===

==== Trajectory corrections ====
On January 28 and 30, 2006, mission controllers guided the probe through its first trajectory-correction maneuver (TCM), which was divided into two parts (TCM-1A and TCM-1B). The total velocity change of these two corrections was about . TCM-1 was accurate enough to permit the cancellation of TCM-2, the second of three originally scheduled corrections. On March 9, 2006, controllers performed TCM-3, the last of three scheduled course corrections. The engines burned for 76 seconds, adjusting the spacecraft&#x27;s velocity by about . Further trajectory maneuvers were not needed until September 25, 2007 (seven months after the Jupiter flyby), when the engines were fired for 15 minutes and 37 seconds, changing the spacecraft&#x27;s velocity by , followed by another TCM, almost three years later on June 30, 2010, that lasted 35.6 seconds, when &quot;New Horizons&quot; had already reached the halfway point (in time traveled) to Pluto.

==== In-flight tests and crossing of Mars orbit ====
During the week of February 20, 2006, controllers conducted initial in-flight tests of three onboard science instruments, the Alice ultraviolet imaging spectrometer, the PEPSSI plasma-sensor, and the LORRI long-range visible-spectrum camera. No scientific measurements or images were taken, but instrument electronics, and in the case of Alice, some electromechanical systems were shown to be functioning correctly.

On April 7, 2006, the spacecraft passed the orbit of Mars, moving at roughly away from the Sun at a solar distance of 243 million kilometers.

==== Asteroid 132524 APL ====
Because of the need to conserve fuel for possible encounters with Kuiper belt objects subsequent to the Pluto flyby, intentional encounters with objects in the asteroid belt were not planned. After launch, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team scanned the spacecraft&#x27;s trajectory to determine if any asteroids would, by chance, be close enough for observation. In May 2006 it was discovered that &quot;New Horizons&quot; would pass close to the tiny asteroid 132524 APL on June 13, 2006. Closest approach occurred at 4:05 UTC at a distance of (around one quarter of the average Earth-Moon distance). The asteroid was imaged by Ralph (use of LORRI was not possible because of proximity to the Sun), which gave the team a chance to test Ralph capabilities, and make observations of the asteroid&#x27;s composition as well as light and phase curves. The asteroid was estimated to be in diameter. The spacecraft successfully tracked the rapidly moving asteroid over June 10–12, 2006.

==== First Pluto sighting ====
The first images of Pluto from &quot;New Horizons&quot; were acquired September 21–24, 2006, during a test of LORRI. They were released on November 28, 2006. The images, taken from a distance of approximately , confirmed the spacecraft&#x27;s ability to track distant targets, critical for maneuvering toward Pluto and other Kuiper belt objects.

=== Jupiter encounter ===
&quot;New Horizons&quot; used LORRI to take its first photographs of Jupiter on September 4, 2006, from a distance of . More detailed exploration of the system began in January 2007 with an infrared image of the moon Callisto, as well as several black-and-white images of Jupiter itself. &quot;New Horizons&quot; received a gravity assist from Jupiter, with its closest approach at 05:43:40 UTC on February 28, 2007, when it was from Jupiter. The flyby increased &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ speed by , accelerating the probe to a velocity of relative to the Sun and shortening its voyage to Pluto by three years.

The flyby was the center of a four-month intensive observation campaign lasting from January to June. Being an ever-changing scientific target, Jupiter has been observed intermittently since the end of the &quot;Galileo&quot; mission in September 2003. Knowledge about Jupiter benefited from the fact that &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ instruments were built using the latest technology, especially in the area of cameras, representing a significant improvement over &quot;Galileo&quot; cameras, which were modified versions of &quot;Voyager&quot; cameras, which, in turn, were modified &quot;Mariner&quot; cameras. The Jupiter encounter also served as a shakedown and dress rehearsal for the Pluto encounter. Because Jupiter is much closer to Earth than Pluto, the communications link can transmit multiple loadings of the memory buffer; thus the mission returned more data from the Jovian system than it was expected to transmit from Pluto.

One of the main goals during the Jupiter encounter was observing its atmospheric conditions and analyzing the structure and composition of its clouds. Heat-induced lightning strikes in the polar regions and &quot;waves&quot; that indicate violent storm activity were observed and measured. The Little Red Spot, spanning up to 70% of Earth&#x27;s diameter, was imaged from up close for the first time. Recording from different angles and illumination conditions, &quot;New Horizons&quot; took detailed images of Jupiter&#x27;s faint ring system, discovering debris left over from recent collisions within the rings or from other unexplained phenomena. The search for undiscovered moons within the rings showed no results. Travelling through Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere, &quot;New Horizons&quot; collected valuable particle readings. &quot;Bubbles&quot; of plasma that are thought to be formed from material ejected by the moon Io were noticed in the magnetotail.

==== Jovian moons ====
The four largest moons of Jupiter were in poor positions for observation; the necessary path of the gravity-assist maneuver meant that &quot;New Horizons&quot; passed millions of kilometers from any of the Galilean moons. Still, its instruments were intended for small, dim targets, so they were scientifically useful on large, distant moons. Emphasis was put on Jupiter&#x27;s innermost Galilean moon, Io, whose active volcanoes shoot out tons of material into Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere, and further. Out of eleven observed eruptions, three were seen for the first time. That of Tvashtar reached an altitude of up to . The event gave scientists an unprecedented look into the structure and motion of the rising plume and its subsequent fall back to the surface. Infrared signatures of a further 36 volcanoes were noticed. Callisto&#x27;s surface was analyzed with LEISA, revealing how lighting and viewing conditions affect infrared spectrum readings of its surface water ice. Minor moons such as Amalthea had their orbit solutions refined. The cameras determined their positions, acting as &quot;reverse optical navigation&quot;.

=== Outer Solar System ===

After passing Jupiter, &quot;New Horizons&quot; spent most of its journey towards Pluto in hibernation mode. Redundant components as well as guidance and control systems were shut down to extend their life cycle, decrease operation costs and free the Deep Space Network for other missions. During hibernation mode, the onboard computer monitored the probe&#x27;s systems and transmitted a signal back to Earth; a &quot;green&quot; code if everything was functioning as expected or a &quot;red&quot; code if mission control&#x27;s assistance was needed. The probe was activated for about two months a year so that the instruments could be calibrated and the systems checked. The first hibernation mode cycle started on June 28, 2007, the second cycle began on December 16, 2008, the third cycle on August 27, 2009, and the fourth cycle on August 29, 2014, after a 10-week test.

&quot;New Horizons&quot; crossed the orbit of Saturn on June 8, 2008, and Uranus on March 18, 2011. After astronomers announced the discovery of two new moons in the Pluto system, Kerberos and Styx, mission planners started contemplating the possibility of the probe running into unseen debris and dust left over from ancient collisions between the moons. A study based on 18 months of computer simulations, Earth-based telescope observations and occultations of the Pluto system revealed that the possibility of a catastrophic collision with debris or dust was less than 0.3% on the probe&#x27;s scheduled course. If the hazard increased, &quot;New Horizons&quot; could have used one of two possible contingency plans, the so-called SHBOTs (Safe Haven by Other Trajectories). Either the probe could have continued on its present trajectory with the antenna facing the incoming particles so the more vital systems would be protected, or it could have positioned its antenna to make a course correction that would take it just from the surface of Pluto where it was expected that the atmospheric drag would have cleaned the surrounding space of possible debris.

While in hibernation mode in July 2012, &quot;New Horizons&quot; started gathering scientific data with SWAP, PEPSSI and VBSDC. Although it was originally planned to activate just the VBSDC, other instruments were powered on in order to collect valuable heliospheric data. Before activating the other two instruments, ground tests were conducted to make sure that the expanded data gathering in this phase of the mission would not limit available energy, memory and fuel in the future and that all systems were functioning during the flyby. The first set of data was transmitted in January 2013 during a three-week activation from hibernation. The command and data handling software was updated to address the problem of computer resets.

==== Possible Neptune trojan targets ====
Other possible targets were Neptune trojans. The probe&#x27;s trajectory to Pluto passed near Neptune&#x27;s trailing Lagrange point (&quot;&quot;), which may host hundreds of bodies in 1:1 resonance. In late 2013, &quot;New Horizons&quot; passed within of the high-inclination L5 Neptune trojan , which was discovered shortly before by the New Horizons KBO Search task, a survey to find additional distant objects for &quot;New Horizons&quot; to fly by after its 2015 encounter with Pluto. At that range, would have been bright enough to be detectable by &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ LORRI instrument; however, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team eventually decided that they would not target for observations because the preparations for the Pluto approach took precedence. On August 25, 2014, &quot;New Horizons&quot; crossed the orbit of Neptune, exactly 25 years after the planet was visited by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe. This was the last major planet orbit crossing before the Pluto flyby. At the time, the spacecraft was away from Neptune and from the Sun.

==== Observations of Pluto and Charon 2013–14 ====
Images from July 1 to 3, 2013, by LORRI were the first by the probe to resolve Pluto and Charon as separate objects. On July 14, 2014, mission controllers performed a sixth trajectory-correction maneuver (TCM) since its launch to enable the craft to reach Pluto. Between July 19–24, 2014, &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ LORRI snapped 12 images of Charon revolving around Pluto, covering almost one full rotation at distances ranging from about . In August 2014, astronomers made high-precision measurements of Pluto&#x27;s location and orbit around the Sun using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an array of radio telescopes located in Chile, to help NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft accurately home in on Pluto. On December 6, 2014, mission controllers sent a signal for the craft to &quot;wake up&quot; from its final Pluto-approach hibernation and begin regular operations. The craft&#x27;s response that it was &quot;awake&quot; reached Earth on December 7, 2014, at 02:30 UTC.

=== Pluto approach ===

Distant-encounter operations at Pluto began on January 4, 2015. On this date, images of the targets with the onboard LORRI imager plus the Ralph telescope were only a few pixels in width. Investigators began taking Pluto images and background starfield images to assist mission navigators in the design of course-correcting engine maneuvers that would precisely modify the trajectory of &quot;New Horizons&quot; to aim the approach.

On February 12, 2015, NASA released new images of Pluto (taken from January 25 to 31) from the approaching probe. &quot;New Horizons&quot; was more than away from Pluto when it began taking the photos, which showed Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. The exposure time was too short to see Pluto&#x27;s smaller, much fainter moons.

Investigators compiled a series of images of the moons Nix and Hydra taken from January 27 through February 8, 2015, beginning at a range of . Pluto and Charon appear as a single overexposed object at the center. The right side image has been processed to remove the background starfield. The other two, even smaller moons—Kerberos and Styx—were seen on photos taken on April 25. Starting on May 11, a hazard search was performed, looking for unknown objects that could be a danger to the spacecraft, such as rings or hitherto undiscovered moons, which could then possibly be avoided by a course change. No rings or additional moons were found.

Also in regard to the approach phase during January 2015, on August 21, 2012, the team announced that they would spend mission time attempting long-range observations of the Kuiper belt object temporarily designated VNH0004 (now designated ), when the object was at a distance of from &quot;New Horizons&quot;. The object would be too distant to resolve surface features or take spectroscopy, but it would be able to make observations that cannot be made from Earth, namely a phase curve and a search for small moons. A second object was planned to be observed in June 2015, and a third in September after the flyby; the team hoped to observe a dozen such objects through 2018. On April 15, 2015, Pluto was imaged showing a possible polar cap.

==== Software glitch ====
On July 4, 2015, &quot;New Horizons&quot; experienced a software anomaly and went into safe mode, preventing the spacecraft from performing scientific observations until engineers could resolve the problem. On July 5, NASA announced that the problem was determined to be a timing flaw in a command sequence used to prepare the spacecraft for its flyby, and the spacecraft would resume scheduled science operations on July 7. The science observations lost because of the anomaly were judged to have no impact on the mission&#x27;s main objectives and minimal impact on other objectives.

The timing flaw consisted of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, and making a second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft&#x27;s primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer, entered safe mode, and sent a distress call back to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4 and alerted engineers that they needed to contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned for the remainder of the encounter.

== Pluto system encounter ==

The closest approach of the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft to Pluto occurred at 11:49 UTC on July 14, 2015, at a range of from the surface and from the center of Pluto. Telemetry data confirming a successful flyby and a healthy spacecraft was received on Earth from the vicinity of the Pluto system on July 15, 2015, 00:52:37 UTC, after 22 hours of planned radio silence due to the spacecraft being pointed towards the Pluto system. Mission managers estimated a one in 10,000 chance that debris could have destroyed the probe or its communication-systems during the flyby, preventing it from sending data to Earth. The first details of the encounter were received the next day, but the download of the complete data set through the 2 kbps data downlink took just over 15 months.

=== Objectives ===
The mission&#x27;s science objectives were grouped in three distinct priorities. The &quot;primary objectives&quot; were required. The &quot;secondary objectives&quot; were expected to be met but were not demanded. The &quot;tertiary objectives&quot; were desired. These objectives could have been skipped in favor of the above objectives. An objective to measure any magnetic field of Pluto was dropped, due to mass and the expense associated with including a magnetometer on the spacecraft. Instead, SWAP and PEPSSI could indirectly detect magnetic fields around Pluto.

* Primary objectives (required)
** Characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and Charon
** Map chemical compositions of Pluto and Charon surfaces
** Characterize the neutral (non-ionized) atmosphere of Pluto and its escape rate
* Secondary objectives (expected)
** Characterize the time variability of Pluto&#x27;s surface and atmosphere
** Image select Pluto and Charon areas in stereo
** Map the terminators (day/night border) of Pluto and Charon with high resolution
** Map the chemical compositions of select Pluto and Charon areas with high resolution
** Characterize Pluto&#x27;s ionosphere (upper layer of the atmosphere) and its interaction with the solar wind
** Search for molecular neutral species such as molecular hydrogen, hydrocarbons, hydrogen cyanide and other nitriles in the atmosphere
** Search for any Charon atmosphere
** Determine bolometric Bond albedos for Pluto and Charon
** Map surface temperatures of Pluto and Charon
** Map any additional surfaces of outermost moons: Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx
* Tertiary objectives (desired)
** Characterize the energetic particle environment at Pluto and Charon
** Refine bulk parameters (radii, masses) and orbits of Pluto and Charon
** Search for additional moons and any rings

&quot;The New Horizons flyby of the Pluto system was fully successful, meeting and in many cases exceeding, the Pluto objectives set out for it by NASA and the National Academy of Sciences.&quot;

=== Flyby details ===

On July 14, 2015, at 11:50 UTC, &quot;New Horizons&quot; made its closest approach to Pluto, passing within 12,500 km (7,800 mi) at a speed of 13.78 km/s (49,600 km/h; 30,800 mph), while also coming as close as 28,800 km (17,900 mi) to Charon. Starting 3.2 days prior, the spacecraft mapped Pluto and Charon with 40 km (25 mi) resolution, enabling coverage of all sides. Close-range imaging was conducted twice daily to monitor for surface changes, such as snowfall or cryovolcanism. During the flyby, LORRI captured images with up to 50 m (160 ft) resolution, MVIC created four-color global maps at 1.6 km (1 mi) resolution, and LEISA obtained near-infrared hyperspectral maps at resolutions ranging from 7 km/px (4.3 mi/px) globally to 0.6 km/px (0.37 mi/px) for selected areas.

Meanwhile, Alice characterized the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules (airglow), and by dimming of background stars as they pass behind Pluto (occultation). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI sampled the high atmosphere and its effects on the solar wind. VBSDC searched for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX performed active and passive radio science. The communications dish on Earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the radio occultation signal as the probe flew by behind Pluto. The results resolved Pluto&#x27;s diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of radio beacons.) Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth (&quot;downlink&quot;). Pluto&#x27;s mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal exhibited a Doppler shift. The Doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics.

Reflected sunlight from Charon allowed some imaging observations of the nightside. Backlighting by the Sun gave an opportunity to highlight any rings or atmospheric hazes. REX performed radiometry of the nightside.
=== Satellite observations ===
&quot;New Horizons&quot;″ best spatial resolution of the small satellites is at Nix, at Hydra, and approximately at Kerberos and Styx. Estimates for the dimensions of these bodies are: Nix at ; Hydra at ; Kerberos at ; and Styx at .

Initial predictions envisioned Kerberos as a relatively large and massive object whose dark surface led to it having a faint reflection. This proved to be wrong as images obtained by &quot;New Horizons&quot; on July 14 and sent back to Earth in October 2015 revealed that Kerberos was smaller in size, across with a highly reflective surface suggesting the presence of relatively clean water ice similarly to the rest of Pluto&#x27;s smaller moons.

== Post-Pluto events ==

Soon after the Pluto flyby, in July 2015, &quot;New Horizons&quot; reported that the spacecraft was healthy, its flight path was within the margins, and science data of the Pluto–Charon system had been recorded. The spacecraft&#x27;s immediate task was to begin returning the 6.25 gigabytes of information collected. The free-space path loss at its distance of 4.5 light-hours () is approximately 303 dB at 7 GHz. Using the high gain antenna and transmitting at full power, the signal from EIRP is +83 dBm, and at this distance, the signal reaching Earth is −220 dBm. The received signal level (RSL) using one, un-arrayed Deep Space Network antenna with 72 dBi of forward gain equals −148 dBm. Because of the extremely low RSL, it could only transmit data at 1 to 2 kilobits per second.

By March 30, 2016, about nine months after the flyby, &quot;New Horizons&quot; reached the halfway point of transmitting this data. The transfer was completed on October 25, 2016, at 21:48 UTC, when the last piece of data—part of a Pluto–Charon observation sequence by the Ralph/LEISA imager—was received by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.

As of November 2018, at a distance of from the Sun and from 486958 Arrokoth, &quot;New Horizons&quot; was of the constellation Sagittarius at relative to the Sun. The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft was magnitude −18.5.

On April 17, 2021, &quot;New Horizons&quot; reached a distance of 50 AU from the Sun, while remaining fully operational.

== Mission extension ==
The &quot;New Horizons&quot; team requested, and received, a mission extension through 2021 to explore additional Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). Funding was secured on July 1, 2016. During this Kuiper Belt Extended Mission (KEM) the spacecraft performed a close fly-by of 486958 Arrokoth and will conduct more distant observations of an additional two dozen objects, and possibly make a fly-by of another KBO.

=== Kuiper belt object mission ===

==== Target background ====
Mission planners searched for one or more additional Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) of the order of in diameter as targets for flybys similar to the spacecraft&#x27;s Plutonian encounter. However, despite the large population of KBOs, many factors limited the number of possible targets. Because the flight path was determined by the Pluto flyby, and the probe only had of hydrazine propellant remaining, the object to be visited needed to be within a cone of less than a degree&#x27;s width extending from Pluto. The target also needed to be within 55 AU, because beyond 55 AU, the communications link becomes too weak, and the RTG power output decays significantly enough to hinder observations. Desirable KBOs are well over in diameter, neutral in color (to contrast with the reddish Pluto), and, if possible, have a moon that imparts a wobble.

==== KBO Search ====
In 2011, mission scientists started the New Horizons KBO Search, a dedicated survey for suitable KBOs using ground telescopes. Large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras, notably the twin 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes in Chile, the 8.2-meter Subaru Observatory in Hawaii and the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope were used to search for potential targets. By participating in a citizen-science project called Ice Hunters the public helped to scan telescopic images for possible suitable mission candidates. The ground-based search resulted in the discovery of about 143 KBOs of potential interest, but none of these were close enough to the flight path of &quot;New Horizons&quot;. Only the Hubble Space Telescope was deemed likely to find a suitable target in time for a successful KBO mission. On June 16, 2014, time on Hubble was granted for a search. Hubble has a much greater ability to find suitable KBOs than ground telescopes. The probability that a target for &quot;New Horizons&quot; would be found was estimated beforehand at about 95%.

==== Suitable KBOs ====
On October 15, 2014, it was revealed that Hubble&#x27;s search had uncovered three potential targets, temporarily designated PT1 (&quot;potential target 1&quot;), PT2 and PT3 by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team. PT1 was eventually chosen as the target and would be named 486958 Arrokoth.

All objects had estimated diameters in the range and were too small to be seen by ground telescopes. The targets were at distances from the Sun ranging from 43 to 44 AU, which would put the encounters in the 2018–2019 period. The initial estimated probabilities that these objects were reachable within &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ fuel budget were 100%, 7%, and 97%, respectively. All were members of the &quot;cold&quot; (low-inclination, low-eccentricity) classical Kuiper belt objects, and thus were very different from Pluto.

PT1 (given the temporary designation &quot;1110113Y&quot; on the HST web site), the most favorably situated object, had a magnitude of 26.8, is in diameter, and was encountered in January 2019. A course change to reach it required about 35% of &quot;New Horizons&quot;″ available trajectory-adjustment fuel supply. A mission to PT3 was in some ways preferable, in that it is brighter and therefore probably larger than PT1, but the greater fuel requirements to reach it would have left less for maneuvering and unforeseen events.

Once sufficient orbital information was provided, the Minor Planet Center gave provisional designations to the three target KBOs: (later 486958 Arrokoth) (PT1), (PT2), and (PT3). By the fall of 2014, a possible fourth target, , had been eliminated by follow-up observations. PT2 was out of the running before the Pluto flyby.

==== KBO selection ====
On August 28, 2015, 486958 Arrokoth (then known as and nicknamed &quot;Ultima Thule&quot;) (PT1) was chosen as the flyby target. The necessary course adjustment was performed with four engine firings between October 22 and November 4, 2015. The flyby occurred on January 1, 2019, at 00:33 UTC.

=== Observations of other KBOs ===

Aside from its flyby of 486958 Arrokoth, the extended mission for &quot;New Horizons&quot; calls for the spacecraft to conduct observations of, and look for ring systems around, between 25 and 35 different KBOs. In addition, it will continue to study the gas, dust and plasma composition of the Kuiper belt before the mission extension ends in 2021.

On November 2, 2015, &quot;New Horizons&quot; imaged KBO 15810 Arawn with the LORRI instrument from . This KBO was again imaged by the LORRI instrument on April 7–8, 2016, from a distance of . The new images allowed the science team to further refine the location of 15810 Arawn to within and to determine its rotational period of 5.47 hours.

In July 2016, the LORRI camera captured some distant images of Quaoar from ; the oblique view will complement Earth-based observations to study the object&#x27;s light-scattering properties.

On December 5, 2017, when &quot;New Horizons&quot; was 40.9 AU from Earth, a calibration image of the Wishing Well cluster marked the most distant image ever taken by a spacecraft (breaking the 27-year record set by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;″s famous &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;). Two hours later, &quot;New Horizons&quot; surpassed its own record, imaging the Kuiper belt objects and from a distance of 0.50 and 0.34 AU, respectively. These were the closest images taken of a Kuiper belt object besides Pluto and Arrokoth .

The dwarf planet Haumea was observed from afar by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft in October 2007, January 2017, and May 2020, from distances of 49 AU, 59 AU, and 63 AU, respectively. &quot;New Horizons&quot; has observed the dwarf planets Eris (2020), Haumea (2007, 2017, 2020), Makemake (2007, 2017), and Quaoar (2016, 2017, 2019), as well as the large KBOs Ixion (2016), (2016, 2017, 2019), and (2017, 2018). It also observed Neptune&#x27;s largest moon Triton (which shares similarities with Pluto and Eris) in 2019.

By December 2023, &quot;New Horizons&quot; had discovered a total of about 100 KBOs, and flown close enough to about 20 of them to capture characteristics such as shape, rotational period, possible moons, and surface composition. In addition, since 2021, Canadian researchers had been able to use machine learning software to speed up identification processes of potential KBO targets for a third flyby, cutting weeks-long efforts to hours-long.

== Encounter with Arrokoth ==


=== Objectives ===
Science objectives of the flyby included characterizing the geology and morphology of Arrokoth and mapping the surface composition (by searching for ammonia, carbon monoxide, methane, and water ice). Searches will be conducted for orbiting moonlets, a coma, rings and the surrounding environment. Additional objectives include:

*Mapping the surface geology to learn how it formed and evolved
*Measuring the surface temperature
*Mapping the 3-D surface topography and surface composition to learn how it is similar to and different from comets such as 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko and dwarf planets such as Pluto
*Searching for any signs of activity, such as a cloud-like coma
*Searching for and studying any satellites or rings
*Measuring or constraining the mass

=== Targeting maneuvers ===
Arrokoth is the first object to be targeted for a flyby that was discovered after the spacecraft was launched. &quot;New Horizons&quot; was planned to come within of Arrokoth, three times closer than the spacecraft&#x27;s earlier encounter with Pluto. Images with a resolution of up to per pixel were expected.

The new mission began on October 22, 2015, when &quot;New Horizons&quot; carried out the first in a series of four initial targeting maneuvers designed to send it towards Arrokoth. The maneuver, which started at approximately 19:50 UTC and used two of the spacecraft&#x27;s small hydrazine-fueled thrusters, lasted approximately 16 minutes and changed the spacecraft&#x27;s trajectory by about . The remaining three targeting maneuvers took place on October 25, October 28, and November 4, 2015.

=== Approach phase ===
The craft was brought out of its hibernation at approximately 00:33 UTC  on June 5, 2018 (06:12 UTC ERT, Earth-Received Time), in order to prepare for the approach phase. After verifying its health status, the spacecraft transitioned from a spin-stabilized mode to a three-axis-stabilized mode on August 13, 2018. The official approach phase began on August 16, 2018, and continued through December 24, 2018.

&quot;New Horizons&quot; made its first detection of Arrokoth on August 16, 2018, from a distance of . At that time, Arrokoth was visible at magnitude 20 against a crowded stellar background in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.

=== Flyby ===
The Core phase began a week before the encounter and continued for two days after the encounter. The spacecraft flew by the object at a speed of and within . The majority of the science data was collected within 48 hours of the closest approach in a phase called the Inner Core. Closest approach occurred January 1, 2019, at 05:33 UTC SCET at which point the probe was from the Sun. At this distance, the one-way transit time for radio signals between Earth and &quot;New Horizons&quot; was six hours. Confirmation that the craft had succeeded in filling its digital recorders occurred when data arrived on Earth ten hours later, at 15:29 UTC.

=== Data download ===

After the encounter, preliminary, high-priority data was sent to Earth on January 1 and 2, 2019. On January 9, &quot;New Horizons&quot; returned to a spin-stabilized mode to prepare sending the remainder of its data back to Earth. This download was expected to take 20 months at a data rate of 1–2 kilobits per second.
As of July 2022, approximately 10% of the data was still left to be received.

== Post-Arrokoth events ==

In April 2020, &quot;New Horizons&quot; was used in conjunction with telescopes on Earth to take pictures of nearby stars Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359; the images from each vantage point – over 6.4 billion km (4 billion miles) apart – were compared to produce &quot;the first demonstration of an easily observable stellar parallax.&quot;

Images taken by the LORRI camera while &quot;New Horizons&quot; was 42 to 45 AU from the Sun were used to measure the cosmic optical background, the visible light analog of the cosmic microwave background, in seven high galactic latitude fields. At that distance &quot;New Horizons&quot; saw a sky ten times darker than the sky seen by the Hubble Space Telescope because of the absence of diffuse background sky brightness from the zodiacal light in the inner solar system. These measurements indicate that the total amount of light emitted by all galaxies at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths may be lower than previously thought.

The spacecraft reached a distance of on April 17, 2021, at 12:42 UTC, a feat performed only four times before, by &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is the farthest spacecraft from the Sun, more than away when &quot;New Horizons&quot; reached its landmark in 2021. The support team continued to use the spacecraft in 2021 to study the heliospheric environment (plasma, dust and gas) and to study other Kuiper Belt objects.

=== Plans ===
After the spacecraft passed Arrokoth, the instruments continue to have enough power to be operational until the 2030s.

Team leader Alan Stern stated there is potential for a third flyby in the 2020s at the outer edges of the Kuiper belt. This depends on a suitable Kuiper belt object being found or confirmed close enough to the spacecraft&#x27;s current trajectory. Since May 2020, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team has been using time on the Subaru Telescope to look for suitable candidates within the spacecraft&#x27;s proximity. As of June 2024, no suitable targets have been found. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, &quot;New Horizons&quot; will focus on specific heliophysics data, as stated by NASA in September 2023. It will remain available for a flyby of a different target until it leaves the Kuiper belt in 2028.

&quot;New Horizons&quot; may also take a picture of Earth from its distance in the Kuiper belt, but only after completing all planned KBO flybys and imaging Uranus and Neptune. This is because pointing a camera towards Earth could cause the camera to be damaged by sunlight, as none of &quot;New Horizons&quot;&#x27; cameras have an active shutter mechanism.

== Speed ==

&quot;New Horizons&quot; has been called &quot;the fastest spacecraft ever launched&quot; because it left Earth at . It is also the first spacecraft launched directly into a solar escape trajectory, which requires an approximate speed while near Earth of , plus additional delta-&quot;v&quot; to cover air and gravity drag, all to be provided by the launch vehicle. As of May 2, 2024, the spacecraft is from the Sun traveling at . 

However, it is not the fastest spacecraft to leave the Solar System. , this record is held by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, traveling at relative to the Sun. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; attained greater hyperbolic excess velocity than &quot;New Horizons&quot; due to gravity assists by Jupiter and Saturn. When &quot;New Horizons&quot; reaches the distance of , it will be traveling at about , around slower than &quot;Voyager 1&quot; at that distance. The Parker Solar Probe can also be measured as the fastest object, because of its orbital speed relative to the Sun at perihelion: . Because it remains in solar orbit, its specific orbital energy relative to the Sun is lower than &quot;New Horizons&quot; and other artificial objects escaping the Solar System.

&quot;New Horizons&quot;″ Star 48B third stage is also on a hyperbolic escape trajectory from the Solar System and reached Jupiter before the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft; it was expected to cross Pluto&#x27;s orbit on October 15, 2015. Because it was not in controlled flight, it did not receive the correct gravity assist and passed within of Pluto. The Centaur second stage did not achieve solar escape velocity and remains in a heliocentric orbit.

<text>Ufology, sometimes written UFOlogy, is the investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) by people who believe that they may be of extraordinary origins (most frequently of extraterrestrial alien visitors). While there are instances of government, private, and fringe science investigations of UFOs, ufology is generally regarded by skeptics and science educators as an example of pseudoscience.

==Etymology==
Ufology is a neologism derived from &quot;UFO&quot; (a term apparently coined by Edward J. Ruppelt), and is derived from appending the acronym UFO with the suffix &quot;-logy&quot; (from the Ancient Greek &quot;-λογία&quot; (&quot;-logia&quot;)). Early uses of ufology include an article in &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot; (1957) and a 1958 presentation for the UFO &quot;research organization&quot; The Planetary Center.

==Historical background==
The roots of ufology include the &quot;mystery airships&quot; of the late 1890s, the &quot;foo fighters&quot; reported by Allied airmen during World War II, the &quot;ghost fliers&quot; of Europe and North America during the 1930s, the &quot;ghost rockets&quot; of Scandinavia (mainly Sweden) in 1946, and the Kenneth Arnold &quot;flying saucer&quot; sighting of 1947. Media attention to the Arnold sighting helped publicize the concept of flying saucers.

Publicity of UFOs increased after World War II, coinciding with the escalation of the Cold War and strategic concerns related to the development and detection (e.g., the Ground Observer Corps) of advanced Soviet aircraft. Official, government-sponsored activities in the United States related to ufology ended in the late 1960s following the Condon Committee report and the termination of Project Blue Book. Government-sponsored, UFO-related activities in other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden also ended. An exception to this trend is France, which maintains the GEIPAN program, formerly known as GEPAN (1977–1988) and SEPRA (1988–2004), operated by the French Space Agency CNES.

On 14 September 2023, NASA reported the appointment, for the first time, of a Director of U.A.P. (known earlier as U.F.O.), identified as Mark McInerney, to scientifically and transparently study such occurrences.

==As a field==
===Status as a pseudoscience===

Despite investigations sponsored by governments and private entities, ufology is not embraced by academia as a scientific field of study, and is instead generally considered a pseudoscience by skeptics and science educators, being often included on lists of topics characterized as pseudoscience as either a partial or total pseudoscience. &quot;Pseudoscience&quot; is a term that classifies arguments that are claimed to exemplify the methods and principles of science, but do not adhere to an appropriate scientific method, lack supporting evidence, plausibility, falsifiability, or otherwise lack scientific status.

Some writers have identified social factors that contribute to the status of ufology as a pseudoscience,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1177/0963662515617706&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with one study suggesting that &quot;any science doubt surrounding unidentified flying objects and aliens was not primarily due to the ignorance of ufologists about science, but rather a product of the respective research practices of and relations between ufology, the sciences, and government investigative bodies&quot;. One study suggests that &quot;the rudimentary standard of science communication attending to the extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) hypothesis for UFOs inhibits public understanding of science, dissuades academic inquiry within the physical and social sciences, and undermines progressive space policy initiatives&quot;.

===Current interest===

In 2021, astronomer Avi Loeb launched The Galileo Project which intends to collect and report scientific evidence of extraterrestrials or extraterrestrial technology on or near Earth via telescopic observations.

In Germany, the University of Würzburg is developing intelligent sensors that can help detect and analyze aerial objects in hopes of applying such technology to UAP.

A 2021 Gallup poll found that belief among Americans in some UFOs being extraterrestrial spacecraft grew between 2019 and 2021 from 33% to 41%. Gallup cited increased coverage in mainstream news and scrutiny from government authorities as a factor in changing attitudes towards UFOs.

In 2022, NASA announced a nine-month study starting in the fall to help establish a road map for investigating UAP – or for reconnaissance of the publicly available data it might use for such research.

In 2023, the RAND Corporation published a study reviewing 101,151 public reports of UAP sightings in the United States from 1998 to 2022. The models used to conduct the analysis showed that reports of UAP sightings were less likely within 30 km of weather stations, 60 km of civilian airports, and in more–densely populated areas, while rural areas tended to have a higher rate of UAP reports. The most consistent and statistically significant finding was that reports of UAP sightings were more likely to occur within 30 km of military operations areas, where routine military training occurs.

===Methodological issues===
Although some ufologists (e.g., Peter A. Sturrock) have proposed explicit methodological activities for the investigation of UFOs, scientific UFO research is challenged by the facts that the phenomena are spatially and temporally unpredictable, are not reproducible, and lack tangible physicality. That most UFO sightings have mundane explanations limits interpretive power of &quot;interesting,&quot; extraordinary UFO-related events, with the astronomer Carl Sagan writing: &quot;The reliable cases are uninteresting and the interesting cases are unreliable. Unfortunately there are no cases that are both reliable and interesting.&quot;
The ufologists J. Allen Hynek and Jacques Vallée have each developed descriptive systems for characterizing UFO sightings and, by extension, for organizing ufology investigations.

===Phenomena linked to ufology===
In addition to UFO sightings, certain supposedly related phenomena are of interest to some ufologists, including crop circles, cattle mutilations, anomalous materials,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.paerosci.2021.100788&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; alien abductions and implants.

Some ufologists have also promoted UFO conspiracy theories, including the Roswell Incident of 1947, the Majestic 12 documents, and UFO disclosure advocates.

Skeptic Robert Sheaffer has accused ufology of having a &quot;credulity explosion,&quot; writing that &quot;the kind of stories generating excitement and attention in any given year would have been rejected by mainstream ufologists a few years earlier for being too outlandish.&quot; The physicist James E. McDonald also identified &quot;cultism&quot; and &quot;extreme...subgroups&quot; as negatively impacting ufology.

===In Posadism===
During the Cold War, ufology was synthesized with the ideas of a Trotskyist movement in South America known as Posadism. Posadism&#x27;s main theorist, Juan Posadas, believed the human race must &quot;appeal to the beings on other planets...to intervene and collaborate with Earth&#x27;s inhabitants in suppressing poverty;&quot; i.e., Posadas wished to collaborate with extraterrestrials to create a socialist system on Earth. The adoption of this belief among Posadists, who had previously been a significant political force in South America, has been noted as a contributing factor in their decline.

==Governmental and private ufology studies==
Starting in the 1940s, governmental agencies and private groups sponsored investigations, studies, and conferences related to ufology. Typically motivated by visual UFO sightings, the goals of these studies included critical evaluation of the observational evidence, attempts to resolve and identify the observed events, and the development of policy recommendations. These studies include Project Sign, Project Magnet, Project Blue Book, the Robertson Panel, and the Condon Committee in the United States, the Flying Saucer Working Party and Project Condign in Britain, GEIPAN in France, and Project Hessdalen in Norway. Private studies of UFO phenomena include those produced by the RAND Corporation in 1968, Harvey Rutledge of the University of Missouri from 1973 to 1980, and the National Press Club&#x27;s Disclosure Project in 2001. Additionally, the United Nations from 1977 to 1979 sponsored meetings and hearings concerning UFO sightings. In August 2020, the United States Department of Defense established the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force to detect, analyze and catalog unidentified aerial phenomena that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.

==UFO organizations and events==

A large number of private organizations dedicated to the study, discussion, and publicity of ufology and other UFO-related topics exist worldwide, including in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Switzerland. Along with such &quot;pro-UFO&quot; groups are skeptic organizations that emphasize the pseudoscientific nature of ufology.

During the annual World UFO Day (2 July), ufologists and associated organizations raise public awareness of ufology to &quot;tell the truth about earthly visits from outer space aliens.&quot; The day&#x27;s events include group gatherings to search for and observe UFOs.

<doc id="390913" wikidata="Q6772944" url="?curid=390913" title="Married by America">
<text>Married by America is an American reality television series broadcast by the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). The series premiered on March 3, 2003, and its eighth and final episode aired on April 14, 2003. American DJ Sean Valentine hosted the series. It was produced by the production company Rocket Science Laboratories (&quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Temptation Island&quot;).

In 2005, &quot;Married by America&quot; was one of several television programs cited in a class-action lawsuit filed by the Writers Guild of America concerning labor law violations.

==Format==
Five single people agreed to be paired up sight unseen with strangers chosen by America. The five newly minted couples met and got engaged on the spot. This was accomplished through family members and phone-in votes by TV viewers. The five couples were Matt and Cortez (a friendly if awkward man and an attractive/uninterested woman who later claimed she was attracted to &quot;the abusers&quot;), Jennifer and Xavier (cold, unfriendly blonde woman and low-key Frenchman model), Stephen and Denise (uncomfortable average guy and low self-esteem woman who liked him much more than he liked her), Jill and Kevin (NHL team hostess and Catholic &quot;daddy&#x27;s girl&quot; and a former pro baseball player seeking a new career), and Billie Jean and Tony (party girl and general bro).

Next, the five couples were at Copper North Ranch for an engagement period. Relationship Experts (Dr. Jenn Bermann, Dr. Don Elium and Ms. P.) eliminated one couple per week, and the final two couples could decide whether or not they wanted to wed.

In the end, neither of the couples (Jill Nicolini and Kevin, Billie Jean Houle and Tony) opted to get married.

==Production==
On October 30, 2002, Fox sent out a press release for &quot;Married by America&quot;. The series was based on the concept of an arranged marriage, with Fox president of alternative entertainment Mike Darnell stating &quot;It’s different, it’s unusual, and it’s the first time anything like this has been tried in [the United States.] Ultimately, it’s up to the individuals if they’re going to get married. But hopefully, if it works, they’ll fall in love.&quot;

==Episodes==
==Reception==
Sheerly Avni of &quot;Salon&quot; criticized the series as &quot;an orgy of vanilla heterophilia, a fantasy of a straight, lily-white America that should have gone the way of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; enterprise.&quot;

==Controversies==
WRAZ, a Fox affiliate in the Raleigh-Durham area, refused to broadcast future episodes of the series following the premiere of the second episode. The affiliate claimed that they contacted Fox to express their concerns over the series&#x27; concept, in which they stated that it &quot;demeans and exploits the institution of marriage.&quot;

===FCC fine===
In the penultimate episode of &quot;Married by America&quot;, the contestants were thrown Bachelor and Bachelorette parties that featured strippers. At the parties, some contestants were depicted licking whipped cream off the body of a stripper while another contestant, who was only wearing underwear, was spanked by two strippers. While some of the strippers were topless, all nudity was pixelated. The sexual nature of the scenes received fierce backlash from the media monitoring organization the Parents Television and Media Council. Over a year after the show&#x27;s cancellation, the FCC fined Fox a record $1.2 million claiming that the episode violated the FCC&#x27;s decency laws. The ruling underwent great scrutiny when blogger Jeff Jarvis uncovered that although the FCC originally claimed to have received 159 complaints, it later admitted to only receiving 90, which came from only 23 people. Jarvis studied the complaints and determined that all but two were virtually identical to each other, meaning that the $1.2 million judgment was based on original complaints written by a total of only three people. The fine was reduced to $91,000 in January 2009.

On September 21, 2012, the United States Department of Justice dismissed the lawsuit.

<doc id="390914" wikidata="Q2571968" url="?curid=390914" title="Pluto Kuiper Express">
<text>Pluto Kuiper Express was an interplanetary space probe that was proposed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) scientists and engineers and under development by NASA. The spacecraft was intended to be launched to study Pluto and its moon Charon, along with one or more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). The proposal was the third of its kind, after the &quot;Pluto 350&quot; and a proposal to send a Mariner Mark II spacecraft to Pluto.

Originally conceived as &quot;Pluto Fast Flyby&quot;, and later briefly named &quot;Pluto Express&quot;, the mission was inspired by a 1991 United States Postal Service stamp that branded Pluto as &quot;Not Yet Explored&quot;. The project brought on JPL engineers and students from the California Institute of Technology and, later, Alan Stern and other scientists from the Pluto 350 project. While the project was initiated in 1992, the project&#x27;s development phase was lengthy, spending nearly a decade in the proposal and funding stage. During planning, the mission was changed to include a Kuiper belt object flyby and re-christened the &quot;Pluto Kuiper Express&quot;, after the discovery of numerous such objects beyond Neptune in the mid-to-late 1990s. NASA ultimately decided to cancel the mission in 2000, however, citing the project&#x27;s expanding budget as the ultimate reason for the cancellation.

After the mission&#x27;s cancellation, most of the &quot;Pluto Fast Flyby&quot; team, including Stern, went on to develop &quot;New Horizons&quot;, a mission nearly identical to &quot;Pluto Kuiper Express&quot;, for NASA&#x27;s New Frontiers program. The spacecraft was successfully launched in January 2006, after a financial standoff with NASA and additional delays, and went on to perform the first ever flyby of the Pluto-Charon system in July 2015.

==History==

As proposed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1992, the Pluto Fast Flyby mission was to be two craft weighing 150 kg (330.7 lb) each. The voyage from Earth to Pluto was to take seven or eight years, with a launch as early as 1998. The two craft would be timed to view different sides of Pluto. The budget for the mission was said to be no more than $400-million, with NASA administrator Daniel Goldin wholeheartedly supporting the proposal.

By 1995, the proposed mission was known as Pluto Express, and pre-project manager Rob Staehle of JPL suggested a budget &quot;in the neighborhood of $300 million&quot;. At this point the mission was still to have been twin spacecraft, and it was hoped it could be launched in 1998. NASA tried to negotiate with Russia for use of Proton rockets to launch the spacecraft, in exchange for carrying Russian &quot;Drop Zond&quot; probes to Pluto. Another idea, emanating from the Max Planck Institute, would have had Germany contribute funding for the launch, in exchange for Pluto Express carrying a German probe to be dropped at Io during the Jupiter gravity assist.

The timing of the mission was important, as it would have passed Pluto shortly before its atmosphere froze, which it was thought to do for a considerable part of its orbit. The mission&#x27;s main objectives would have been to map Pluto&#x27;s surface and examine the double system&#x27;s geology and geomorphology, as well as determining the composition of Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere. This last task would have been considerably more difficult after the start of atmospheric freezing. Scientific equipment on board would have included visible light imaging systems, infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers, and an ultrastable oscillator (USO) for use in a radio occultation experiment.

The spacecraft was to have been a simple hexagonal prism-shaped structure weighing some 220 kg (485 lb), powered by radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) similar to those used on the &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Cassini&quot; missions. On-board control and data collection would have been maintained by a 1.5 MIPS RISC-based computer system capable of processing data at 5 Mbit/s. This would have allowed for the transmission of over one gigabyte of data over a one-year period. Communications would have been via a fixed 1.47 m (5.6 ft) high-gain antenna, directionally corrected using a wide-field star tracker. Early in the mission&#x27;s planning there was suggestion of combining efforts with the Russian space agency and including Zond probes to study the Plutonian atmosphere. This plan was later abandoned.

The Pluto Express was predicted to be launched in 2001, but it was not ready until late 2004. The spacecraft was to have been launched via either a Delta rocket or the Space Shuttle, most likely in December 2004. Had that happened, the only option would have been to use a Delta rocket, as the Shuttle fleet was grounded after the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. The course would have been initially via Jupiter, whose gravity well would have been used to increase the probe&#x27;s velocity via a gravity assist. The closest approach distance to Pluto would have been about 15,000 km (9320.6 mi) at 17–18 km/s (38,027.9–40,264.9 mph), so as to allow for 1 km (0.6 mi) resolution mapping. After passing Pluto, the spacecraft would have used its imaging camera to search for Kuiper Belt objects.

In September 2000 NASA ceased work on the Pluto-Kuiper Express mission, although the agency said it was being &quot;rethought and replanned&quot;, not scrapped. The mission&#x27;s cost at that time was said by a NASA spokesperson to be an unaffordable $500 million (compared to an original budget of $350 million in 1999).

<doc id="390915" wikidata="Q13301" url="?curid=390915" title="Khoekhoe language">
<text>Khoekhoe ( ; , ), also known by the ethnic terms Nama ( ; &quot;Namagowab&quot;), Damara (&quot;ǂNūkhoegowab&quot;), or Nama/Damara and formerly as Hottentot, is the most widespread of the non-Bantu languages of Southern Africa that make heavy use of click consonants and therefore were formerly classified as Khoisan, a grouping now recognized as obsolete. It belongs to the Khoe language family, and is spoken in Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa primarily by three ethnic groups: Namakhoen, ǂNūkhoen, and Haiǁomkhoen.

==History==
The Haiǁom, who had spoken a Juu language, later shifted to Khoekhoe. The name for the speakers, &quot;Khoekhoen&quot;, is from the word &quot;khoe&quot; &quot;person&quot;, with reduplication and the suffix &quot;-n&quot; to indicate the general plural. Georg Friedrich Wreede was the first European to study the language, after arriving in ǁHui!gaeb (later Cape Town) in 1659. 

==Status==
Khoekhoe is a national language in Namibia. In Namibia and South Africa, state-owned broadcasting corporations produce and broadcast radio programmes in Khoekhoe.

It is estimated that only around 167,000 speakers of Khoekhoe remain in Africa, which makes it an endangered language. In 2019, the University of Cape Town ran a series of short courses teaching the language, and 21 September 2020 launched its new Khoi and San Centre. An undergraduate degree programme is being planned to be rolled out in coming years.

==Dialects==

Modern scholars generally see three dialects: 
*Nama–Damara, incl. Sesfontein Damara
*Haiǁom
*ǂĀkhoe, itself a dialect cluster, and intermediate between Haiǁom and the Kalahari Khoe languages

They are distinct enough that they might be considered two or three distinct languages.

*Eini (extinct) is also close but is now generally counted as a distinct language.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
There are 5 vowel qualities, found as oral and nasal . is strongly rounded, only slightly so. is the only vowel with notable allophony; it is pronounced before or .

===Tone===
Nama has been described as having three or four tones, or , which may occur on each mora (vowels and final nasal consonants). The high tone is higher when it occurs on one of the high vowels () or on a nasal () than on mid or low vowels ().

The tones combine into a limited number of &#x27;tone melodies&#x27; (word tones), which have sandhi forms in certain syntactic environments. The most important melodies, in their citation and main sandhi forms, are as follows:

===Stress===
Within a phrase, lexical words receive greater stress than grammatical words. Within a word, the first syllable receives the most stress. Subsequent syllables receive less and less stress and are spoken more and more quickly.

===Consonants===
Nama has 31 consonants: 20 clicks and only 11 non-clicks.

====Non-clicks====
Orthography in brackets.

Between vowels, is pronounced and is pronounced . The affricate series is strongly aspirated, and may be analysed phonemically as aspirated stops; in the related Korana they are .

Beach (1938) reported that the Khoekhoe of the time had a velar lateral ejective affricate, , a common realisation or allophone of in languages with clicks. This sound no longer occurs in Khoekhoe but remains in its cousin Korana.

====Clicks====
The clicks are doubly articulated consonants. Each click consists of one of four primary articulations or &quot;influxes&quot; and one of five secondary articulation or &quot;effluxes&quot;. The combination results in 20 phonemes.

The aspiration on the aspirated clicks is often light but is &#x27;raspier&#x27; than the aspirated nasal clicks, with a sound approaching the &quot;ch&quot; of Scottish &quot;loch&quot;. The glottalized clicks are clearly voiceless due to the hold before the release, and they are transcribed as simple voiceless clicks in the traditional orthography. The nasal component is not audible in initial position; the voiceless nasal component of the aspirated clicks is also difficult to hear when not between vowels, so to foreign ears, it may sound like a longer but less raspy version of the contour clicks.

Tindall notes that European learners almost invariably pronounce the lateral clicks by placing the tongue against the side teeth and that this articulation is &quot;harsh and foreign to the native ear&quot;. The Namaqua instead cover the whole of the palate with the tongue and produce the sound &quot;as far back in the palate as possible&quot;.

===Phonotactics===
Lexical root words consist of two or rarely three moras, in the form CVCV(C), CVV(C), or CVN(C). (The initial consonant is required.) The middle consonant may only be &quot;w r m n&quot; (&quot;w&quot; is &quot;b~p&quot; and &quot;r&quot; is &quot;d~t&quot;), while the final consonant (C) may only be &quot;p, s, ts&quot;. Each mora carries tone, but the second may only be high or medium, for six tone &quot;melodies&quot;: HH, MH, LH, HM, MM, LM.

Oral vowel sequences in CVV are . Due to the reduced number of nasal vowels, nasal sequences are . Sequences ending in a high vowel () are pronounced more quickly than others (), more like diphthongs and long vowels than like vowel sequences in hiatus. The tones are realised as contours. CVCV words tend to have the same vowel sequences, though there are many exceptions. The two tones are also more distinct.

Vowel-nasal sequences are restricted to non-front vowels: . Their tones are also realised as contours.

Grammatical particles have the form CV or CN, with any vowel or tone, where C may be any consonant but a click, and the latter cannot be NN. Suffixes and a third mora of a root, may have the form CV, CN, V, N, with any vowel or tone; there are also three C-only suffixes, &quot;-p&quot; 1m.sg, &quot;-ts&quot; 2m.sg, &quot;-s&quot; 2/3f.sg.

==Orthography==
There have been several orthographies used for Nama. &quot;A Khoekhoegowab dictionary&quot; (Haacke 2000) uses the modern standard.

In standard orthography, the consonants &quot;b d g&quot; are used for words with one of the lower tone melodies and &quot;p t k&quot; for one of the higher tone melodies; they are otherwise pronounced the same. &quot;W&quot; is only used between vowels, though it may be replaced with &quot;b&quot; or &quot;p&quot; according to tone. Overt tone marking is otherwise generally omitted.

Nasal vowels are written with a circumflex. All nasal vowels are long, as in &quot;hû&quot; &#x27;seven&#x27;. Long (double) vowels are otherwise written with a macron, as in &quot;ā&quot; &#x27;to cry, weep&#x27;; these constitute two moras (two tone-bearing units).

A glottal stop is not written at the beginning of a word (where it is predictable), but it is transcribed with a hyphen in compound words, such as &quot;gao-aob&quot; &#x27;chief&#x27;.

The clicks are written with the Lepsius letters that were later adopted as IPA symbols. The basic (tenuis) clicks are:
*ǀg (a single pipe) for a dental click
*ǁg (a double pipe) for a lateral click
*ǃg (a pipe with an under-dot, approximately an exclamation mark) for an alveolar click
*ǂg (a pipe with a double cross stroke) for a palatal click

Sometimes ASCII characters are substituted, e.g. the hash (#) in place of ǂ.

==Grammar==
Nama has a subject–object–verb word order, three nouns classes (&quot;masculine/gu-class, feminine/di-class&quot; and &quot;neuter/n-class&quot;) and three grammatical numbers (&quot;singular, dual&quot; and &quot;plural&quot;). Pronominal enclitics are used to mark person, gender, and number on the noun phrases.

===Person, gender and number markers===
The PGN (person-gender-number) markers are enclitic pronouns that attach to noun phrases. The PGN markers distinguish first, second, and third person, masculine, feminine, and neuter gender, and singular, dual, and plural number. The PGN markers can be divided into nominative, object, and oblique paradigms.

====Nominative====
====Object====
(PGN + &quot;i&quot;)
====Oblique====
(PGN + &quot;a&quot;)
===Articles===
Khoekhoe has four definite articles: &quot;ti&quot;, &quot;si&quot;, &quot;sa&quot;, &quot;ǁî&quot;. These definite articles can be combined with PGN markers.

Examples from Haacke (2013):

* &quot;si-khom&quot; &quot;we two males&quot; (someone other than addressee and I)
* &quot;sa-khom&quot; &quot;we two males&quot; (addressee and I)
* &quot;ǁî-khom&quot; &quot;we two males&quot; (someone else referred to previously and I)

=== Clause headings ===
There are three clause markers, ge (declarative), kha (interrogative), and ko/km (assertive). These markers appear in matrix clauses, and appear after the subject.

==Sample text==

Following is a sample text in the Khoekhoe language.

:&quot;Nē ǀkharib ǃnâ da ge ǁGûn tsî ǀGaen tsî doan tsîn; tsî ǀNopodi tsî ǀKhenadi tsî ǀhuigu tsî ǀAmin tsîn; tsî !kharagagu ǀaon tsîna ra hō.&quot;

:In this region, we find springbuck, oryx, and duiker; francolin, guinea fowl, bustard, and ostrich; and also various kinds of snake.

==Common words and phrases==

It was founded in 1967 by Kenneth Anderson and Italian immigrant Les Marino. Beginning with a single sidewalk contract in Peabody, Massachusetts, the company grew into a regional heavy construction giant. 

Marine construction firm Spearin, Preston &amp; Burrows of Staten Island was acquired by Modern Continental. 

Modern Continental specialized in: 

* Airports
* Heavy Civil 
* Design/Build
* Power &amp; Industrial
* Mass Transit &amp; Rail
* Highway &amp; Bridges
* Buildings &amp; Foundations

Modern Continental Enterprises was a division of the company involved in various ventures. It built housing developments and managed office buildings. The division also operated marinas, charter and tendered bus services through Paul Revere Transportation, and ferry services through Boston Harbor Cruises. Additionally, it owned and operated an organic produce farm in Natick, Massachusetts, and ran an Italian restaurant, Ristorante Marino, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Boston Harbor Cruises and Paul Revere Transportation were originally joint ventures established to transport workers to and from Deer Island during the construction of the Wastewater Treatment Plant.

==Criticism==
Throughout 2004, Modern Continental Construction endured mounting criticism for its failure to complete multiple projects on schedule and its financial stability was questioned. These included the Route 3 North highway-widening project in northeastern Massachusetts and a major drinking-water pipeline in the San Francisco Bay Area. MCC was to finish the widening of Route 3 in 42 months by early 2005, but incurred delays of an additional 8 months. The State of Massachusetts fined Modern $10,000 for each day the project was unfinished.

The East Bay Municipal Utility District terminated a $24.5 million contract with Modern in early 2004 due to Modern&#x27;s failure to meet construction schedules, insufficient staffing and oversight, and numerous pipe defects that Modern was unable to correct. East Bay Municipal Utility District reversed the termination for cause to a termination for convenience. 

Modern was also briefly dropped from Massachusetts&#x27; list of highway contractors qualified to bid on state-funded projects. Later that year, questions were raised about the workmanship on a Central Artery contract, for which Modern was the lead contractor, after a large leak was found in the Interstate 93 tunnel beneath downtown Boston which led to the disclosure and discovery of &quot;thousands of leaks.&quot;

On September 23, 2004, Marino announced plans to merge Modern Continental Construction with a subdivision of Jay Cashman, Inc., following recommendations from the insurance firms that bonded Modern&#x27;s projects. Under the arrangement, Cashman would assume control of the company and oversee the completion of its remaining projects.

==Ceiling collapse==

On July 10, 2006, approximately 26 short tons (52,000 lb; 23,500 kg) of concrete and framing materials fell from the ceiling of a tunnel on Interstate 90 in South Boston, Massachusetts. The collapse struck a car driven by Boston resident Angel Del Valle, severely injuring him and killing his wife, Milena. Investigations attributed the failure to bolts anchored with an epoxy adhesive that were used to secure the ceiling panels. This section of the highway was constructed by Modern Continental in 1999.

===Investigation===

During the period after the ceiling panel collapse, a memo allegedly written in 1999 by John J. Keaveney, a former Modern Continental employee, to his Project Manager warning of the potential for failure of the hanger system was sent to the Boston Globe. Keaveney said that he sent it to the Globe with a current Modern Continental employee&#x27;s name and office address on the envelope because he feared the consequences if it were known that he provided the newspaper with the memo. &quot;I was worried about the repercussions and that it might affect my family and my livelihood,&quot; stated Keaveney.

==Bankruptcy==
On June 23, 2008, Modern Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court in Boston.

==LM Holdings LLC and LM Heavy Civil Construction, LLC==
Following the bankruptcy of Modern Continental, a series of companies were formed by key executive personnel. LM Holdings LLC of Westford, Massachusetts was established by Massimo (Max) Marino in 2005. In 2010, the company was renamed LMH (LM Heavy Civil Construction, LLC) as part of an emphasis on establishing itself in the industry void once filled by Modern Continental. 

=== Growth and Major Projects ===
LMH was fully acquired by Italy based C.M.C. di Ravenna (Cooperativa Muratori Cementisti) in 2011 and was held by its subsidiary CMC Holding Overseas S.p.a. LMH performed both site development/earthmoving for private clients and heavy construction for public agencies such as the MBTA and MassDOT. LMH continually won a slew of MBTA contracts as the apparent low bidder and quickly became a major player in trackwork. 

The MBTA awarded the Wollaston Station Improvements and Quincy Center Garage Demolition contract, valued at $67,867,000, to a Joint Venture of LM Heavy and CMC in June 2016. 

In 2017 LMH was shortlisted for the MBTA Green Line Extension (GLX) as part of the design-build consortium &quot;Green Line Partners&quot;. This group was made up of The Lane Construction Corporation, Salini Impregilo, Judlau Contracting, and LMH-C.M.C. di Ravenna Joint Venture. Ultimately, the group failed to secure the project. 

A $214-million project to renovate the MBTA Red Line Cabot Yard was awarded to LMH Lane, a Joint Venture of LM Heavy Civil and Cheshire CT based Lane Construction Co. Work proceeded in July 2018. 

=== Demise ===
On December 7, 2018, CMC issued a press release stating that it had begun the process of insolvency according to Italian Law. Following the insolvency of CMC, LMH faced financial challenges that threatened its ability to complete its contracts with clients namely the MBTA. LMH had stated it had &quot;essentially no money and as a result is unable to continue daily operations.&quot; During 2019, CMC and CMC Holding Overseas sought to find solutions to the &quot;serious crisis situation of LMH&quot; by negotiating with the creditors Zurich NA, Unicredit NY, and McCourt Legal Advisor. Projects such as the Wollaston Station Improvements were taken over by bond holders Zurich American Insurance Co. and its subsidiary, Fidelity and Deposit Co. of Maryland.

<doc id="390926" wikidata="Q311109" url="?curid=390926" title="Wuchereria bancrofti">
<text>Wuchereria bancrofti is a filarial (arthropod-borne) nematode (roundworm) that is the major cause of lymphatic filariasis. It is one of the three parasitic worms, together with &quot;Brugia malayi&quot; and &quot;B. timori&quot;, that infect the lymphatic system to cause lymphatic filariasis. These filarial worms are spread by a variety of mosquito vector species. &quot;W. bancrofti&quot; is the most prevalent of the three and affects over 120 million people, primarily in Central Africa and the Nile delta, South and Central America, the tropical regions of Asia including southern China, and the Pacific islands. If left untreated, the infection can develop into lymphatic filariasis. In rare conditions, it also causes tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. No vaccine is commercially available, but high rates of cure have been achieved with various antifilarial regimens, and lymphatic filariasis is the target of the World Health Organization Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis with the aim to eradicate the disease as a public-health problem by 2020. However, this goal was not met by 2020. 

== Morphology ==
As a dioecious worm, &quot;W. bancrofti&quot; exhibits sexual dimorphism. The adult worm is long, cylindrical, slender, and smooth with rounded ends. It is white in colour and almost transparent. The body is quite delicate, making removing it from tissues difficult. It has a short cephalic or head region connected to the main body by a short neck, which appears as a constriction. Dark spots are dispersed nuclei throughout the body cavity, with no nuclei at the tail tip. Males and females can be differentiated by size and structure of their tail tips. The male worm is smaller, long and wide, and features a ventrally curved tail. The tip of the tail has 15 pairs of minute caudal papillae, the sensory organs. The anal region is an elaborate structure consisting of 12 pairs of papillae, of which eight are in front and four are behind the anus. In contrast, the female is to long and wide, nearly three times larger in diameter than the male. Its tail gradually tapers and is rounded at the tip. No additional sensory structures are seen. Its vulva lies towards the anterior region, about 0.25 mm from the head. Adult males and females are most often coiled together and are difficult to separate. Females are ovoviviparous and can produce thousands of juveniles known as microfilariae.

The microfilaria is a miniature adult, and retains the egg membrane as a sheath, and is often considered an advanced embryo. It measures 280 μm long and 25 μm wide. It appears quite structureless &quot;in vivo&quot;, but histological staining makes its primitive gut, nerve ring, and muscles apparent.

== Lifecycle ==

&quot;W. bancrofti&quot; carries out its lifecycle in two hosts. Humans serve as the definitive host and mosquitos as the intermediate host. The adult parasites reside in the lymphatics of the human host. They are found mostly in the afferent lymphatic channels of the lymph glands in the lower part of the body. The first-stage larvae, known as microfilariae, are present in the circulation. The microfilariae have a membrane &quot;sheath&quot;. This sheath, along with the area in which the worms reside, makes identification of the species of microfilariae in humans easier to determine. The microfilariae are found mainly in the peripheral blood and can be found at peak amounts from 10 pm to 4 am. They migrate between the deep and the peripheral, circulation exhibiting unique diurnal periodicity. During the day, they are present in the deep veins, and during the night, they migrate to the peripheral circulation. The cause of this periodicity remains unknown, but the advantages of the microfilariae being in the peripheral blood during these hours may ensure the vector, the nighttime mosquito, will have a higher chance of transmitting them elsewhere. Physiological changes also are associated with sleeping, such as lowered body temperature, oxygen tension, and adrenal activity, and an increased carbon dioxide tension, among other physical alterations, any of which could be the signals for the rhythmic behavior of microfilarial parasites. If the hosts sleep by day and are awake at night, their periodicity is reversed. In the South Pacific, where &quot;W. bancrofti&quot; shows diurnal periodicity, it is known as periodic.

The microfilariae are transferred into a vector, which are most commonly mosquito species of the genera &quot;Culex&quot;, &quot;Anopheles&quot;, &quot;Mansonia&quot;, and &quot;Aedes&quot;. Inside the mosquito, the microfilariae mature into motile larvae called juveniles; these migrate to the labium after a period around 10 days. When the infected mosquito has its next blood meal, &quot;W. bancrofti&quot; larvae are deposited from the mouthparts onto the skin of the prospective host and migrate through microcuts in the dermis or the tract created by the proboscis into the bloodstream of the new human host. The larvae move through the lymphatic system to regional lymph nodes, predominantly in the legs and genital area. The larvae develop into adult worms over the course of a year, and reach sexual maturity in the afferent lymphatic vessels. After mating, the adult female worm can produce thousands of microfilariae that migrate into the bloodstream. A mosquito vector can bite the infected human host, ingest the microfilariae, and thus repeat the lifecycle. The organism notably does not multiply within its intermediate host, the mosquito.

==History==
The effects of &quot;W. bancrofti&quot; were documented early in ancient texts. Ancient Greek and Roman writers noted the similarities between the enlarged limbs and thickened, cracked skin of infected individuals to that of elephants, hence the name elephantiasis to describe the disease.

In 1862 in Paris, found what appeared to be nematode worms in the fluid aspirated from a hydrocele in a young man from Havana, Cuba. Unaware of this observation, three years later in Bahia, Brazil, found these same worms but this time in urine from a woman with chyluria. Ignorant of both these observations, Timothy Lewis in India in 1870 found them in the urine of an Indian with chyluria then two years later found them in blood. Some of Lewis&#x27;s specimens were examined in the same year in England by George Busk who named them &quot;Filaria sanguinis hominis&quot;. In 1876 and 1877, Joseph Bancroft in Brisbane, Australia found adult worms in lymphatic abscesses in patients with larvae in the blood. He sent them to Spencer Cobbold in London who named them &quot;Filaria Bancrofti&quot;. Patrick Manson in Xiamen, China (then called Amoy) made two important observations. Firstly he discovered in 1877 that if &quot;Culex quinquefasciatus&quot; and &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; mosquitoes fed on a person with larvae (microfilariae) in the blood, they moulted twice in the insects&#x27; abdomen and became larger worms now called infective larvae. Secondly, he found in 1879 that the blood-dwelling forms had a nocturnal periodicity with large numbers appearing in the blood around midnight with minimal numbers in the middle of the day. This coincided with the biting habits of these mosquitoes. Manson surmised that infected mosquitoes drowned and infective larvae were ingested in water. In 1899, Thomas Bancroft in Brisbane fed laboratory-reared mosquitoes on a patient with microfilaraemia, kept them for 16 days, then sent some specimens to George Low in London. Low prepared histological sections of the mosquitoes and found that the larvae migrated from the abdomen to the thorax to the salivary glands then passed down the proboscis suggesting that infective larvae were injected at a subsequent mosquito bite. In 1902, Thomas Bancroft proved that this was the mode of transmission using a related worm, &quot;Dirofilaria immitis&quot;, and generated adult worms in experimentally infected dogs. In 1921, Léon Seurat erected the genus &quot;Wuchereria&quot; and placed this worm in it as &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot;.

&quot;W. bancrofti&quot; is speculated to have been brought to the New World by the slave trade. Once it was introduced to the New World, this filarial worm disease persisted throughout the areas surrounding Charleston, South Carolina, until its sudden disappearance in the 1920s.

<text>This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and the modern Russian Federation.

== Postal history ==

===Early history===
Records mention a system of messengers in the 10th century. Early letters were carried in the form of a roll, with a wax or lead seal; the earliest known of these seals dates from 1079, and mentions a governor Ratibor of Tmutarakan. The earliest surviving cover was sent in 1391 from La Tana (now Azov) to Venice.

By the 16th century, the postal system included 1,600 locations, and mail took three days to travel from Moscow to Novgorod. In 1634, a peace treaty between Russia and Poland established a route to Warsaw, becoming Russia&#x27;s first regular international service.

===Russian Empire===
Peter the Great enacted reforms making the postal system more uniform in its operations, and in 1714 the first general post offices opened in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. “Regular post-service” was established along the Moscow and Riga routes. In February 1714, the postal service started biweekly runs from St. Petersburg to Riga; in June it started runs from St. Petersburg to Moscow. The field post office was founded in 1716, and the so-called ordinary post service in 1720, for the fast conveyance of state ordinances and papers. Regular delivery of private parcels (the so-called heavy post) was organized in the 1730–1740s. In 1746, parcels and private correspondence were first delivered by courier, and starting in 1781 money, too, could be delivered to one&#x27;s door. The earliest known Russian postmark dates from July 1765; it is a single line reading &quot;ST.PETERSBURG&quot; (in Latin letters), but the first official recommendation to use postmarks did not come until 1781.

Mailcoaches appeared in 1820. In 1833, the St. Petersburg City Post was created, and the city was divided into 17 districts with 42 correspondence offices, which were located in trade stores. In 1834, reception offices appeared in the suburbs (in St. Petersburg there were as many as 108). Periodical press delivery in Russia was organized in St. Petersburg in 1838. The Department of Coaches and T-carts was opened in 1840 at the Moika Embankment; light cabriolets carried surplus-post, coaches delivered light post, and T-carts dealt with “heavy&quot; post. Green coloured street mailboxes were installed in 1848, the same year stamped envelopes were issued; orange mailboxes for same-day service appeared near railway stations in 1851, and postage stamps appeared in 1857. In 1864, the City Post started sending printed matter and catalogues, and in 1866, they sent packages.

Postal stationery made its first appearance in 1845, in the form of envelopes that paid the 5-kopeck fee for local mail in St. Petersburg and Moscow. The idea worked well and was extended throughout Russia on December 1, 1848.

Local postal systems used stamps referred to as Zemstvo stamps, from the term for local government begun under Alexander II in 1864.

Russian Post is a founding member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) created in 1874. In 1902 Chief Postal Service was made part of the Internal Affairs Ministry and in 1917 under the Provisional Government it became part of Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs.

===Soviet Union===

During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet postal service was a part of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Communications of the USSR. It delivered up to 70 million parcels per month to the Soviet Army front from the rear under extremely difficult and often very dangerous conditions.

In the postwar years, the mail service has undergone quantitative and qualitative changes. In 1946, the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Communications of the USSR was transformed into the Ministry of Communications of the USSR. The postal service was carried out by the Post Office, which was part of the Ministry of Communications, along with other offices of the telecommunications industries. By 1950, the postal industry, destroyed by the war, was restored and brought to the pre-war level.

In subsequent years, the network of communication enterprises was significantly expanded, especially in rural areas, in the cities and a network of liaison offices, post offices, and subordinate communication centers. Most businesses combined postal, telegraph and telephone services. These communications were typically located in the same building and under single management. A huge network of mailboxes was established not only in cities but also in rural areas, stations, railway sidings and at freeway junctions.

Further development of the postal service followed the path of mechanization and automation of mail processing, improving the organization of its transportation and delivery. For this, the old postal equipment was modernized and the production of brand new designs developed – mail processing and handling machines and equipment for container transport, means of mechanization and postal inventory, as well as equipment for customer service.

====Leningrad post office====
By the late 1930s, 203 post offices operated in Leningrad. During the Great Patriotic War of 1941–1945, communication between the front line and the rear was provided by the Field Post. In the first year of the Siege, there were 108 post offices working in Leningrad. The Leningrad Postal Association was created in 1988 and included the General Leningrad Post Office, 13 regional post offices, 345 post offices, 11 automated post offices, and a fleet of vehicles.

===Russian Federation===
In 1993 the Russian Post became a part of the Ministry of Communications. In 1995, the Office was reorganized into the Federal Service of the Russian Federation postal service, and in 1996 it was reorganized into the Department of Posts in the Ministry of Communications of the Russian Federation. Russian postal enterprises were operating and there was commercial independence, but with it the strong competition posed by former partners, the telecommunication companies. Thus, despite the separation of industries, a unique postal network, established in prior periods and covering almost all localities in the country, has been preserved.

Given the role of the Russian Post in the historical development of the state, in 1994, Russian President Boris Yeltsin established a professional public holiday for postal workers – &quot;The Day of the Russian Post&quot;, which is celebrated annually on the 2 July. Another presidential decree in 1997 restored the heraldic traditions of the Post with the adding of the emblem and flag.

===Loss of monopoly===
In 1996, the Ministry of Communications for the first time decided to break the state postal monopoly on some postal services, resulting in Russia having commercial mailing companies.

===2002 reform===

Since the Soviet Union was dissolved, the Federal Postal Service consisted of a network of 90 disparate entities which were mainly listed as state institutions or federal state unitary enterprises. In legal terms, they were completely independent concerns. They were linked to the Federal Postal Network only by a trunk intrazonal and inter-district transmission and delivery system. The most ridiculous part of the whole system was that different parts of the same system connected by a single mechanism in adjacent regions were competing against each other, which mainly involved trying to lure big corporate clients away from the other competitors often at dumping prices. Also, there were no uniform budgeting, planning or other processes. These companies operated using outdated and worn-out postal facilities representing about 50 different IT solutions in terms of industry technology. In accordance with the concept of restructuring the federal postal service, adopted by the Government Decree on 28 June 2002, the postal industry in the Russian Federation carried out the reorganization, aimed at creating a single, highly efficient and competitive company able to make a significant contribution to the solution of urgent problems on the accelerated development of the economy and resulted in the establishment of a single unified operator- Federal Unitary Enterprise Russian Post. By 2005 the reform was completed.

In 2004 Elsag Datamat won the tender to build Russian Post&#x27;s first automated sorting center.

===Growing inefficiency in the 2010s===

The early 2010s saw a rise in complaints. The number of parcels from foreign online retailers had been rising steadily for several years and was certain to rise further. According to the Russian Post&#x27;s own estimates, orders from Internet shops are delivered to Russia mostly in ordinary or registered parcels; in 2009 there were 2.3 million, in 2012 the amount soared to 17 million. On March 6, 2012, five trucks from Germany were in a queue to be unloaded at Vnukovo. At the International Post Office there had piled up 12,300 parcels, 5,300 EMS packages, and 36,000 minor incoming parcels. And two thousand parcels were waiting for customs clearance at Sheremetyevo International Airport.

The year 2012 saw the creation of a new resource called &quot;anti-Russianpost.ru&quot; emerge in the World Wide Web. The users highlight all instances of Russian Post&#x27;s bad work. In the middle of March, the clients of on-line retailers launched a massive spam attack on the Moscow office of the Roskomnadzor watchdog. In this period the company received up to 1,000 messages from individuals with complaints about delayed deliveries of purchases made at Internet shops.

===2013 collapse and reform===

In March 2013 Russian Post reported the unfavorable state of affairs to the authorities. In a special message Russian Post&#x27;s deputy general director, Nina Fetisova, told the Federal Communications Agency Rossvyaz and the Federal Customs Service the processing of international mail was in a critical situation at the customs posts Vnukovo and Sheremetyevo International Airport and also at the Central International Post Office in Moscow.

In order to improve the services, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed a Government Resolution to take the Russian Post out of the sphere of competence of the Federal Communications Agency Rossvyaz, and subordinated it directly to the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media. Also, On April of that year, the General Director of the Post, Alexander Kiselyov was ousted from the office.

The company&#x27;s new management, in October 2013, stated an ambitious goal of doubling revenues to make the company ready for an initial public offering in 2018 by allowing it to provide banking services, reducing the number of unprofitable branches and focusing on providing deliveries from online retailers.

In order to handle the growth of parcels, production capacity has been expanded regional seats of international postal exchange centers, with the company opening new international mail processing centers in Moscow at the Kazan station and in Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk. In addition, Russian Post agreed with foreign postal operators sorting international mail delivery by region even in the country of the sender (pre-sorting began in China, the largest importer), which allows to reduce the delivery of international mail. For example, after opening Exchange center in Yekaterinburg, parcel from China to residents of the Sverdlovsk Oblast is delivered in five days, including all customs clearance.

In August 2013 Russian Post had launched its first regional flight in the far eastern Russian republic of Yakutia. The company held a ceremony at Yakutsk Airport to launch its second new airmail plane under a program to expand links to remote areas, its first being a flight in the Khabarovsk Krai territory on Russia&#x27;s east coast. Russian Post deputy director-general Alexei Skatin said that &quot;The mail must be delivered on time despite the difficult geography of the region. We are starting to improve the postal logistics in the remote regions of Russia&quot;.

===2014 takeover of Crimea by Russia===
In March 2014, following the takeover of Crimea by pro-Russian separatists and the Russian Armed Forces, the Russian Post announced a number of measures to organize postal services with the Republic of Crimea in accordance with postal regulations of the Russian Federation, as well as to unify the mail systems of indexing.

== Postage stamps ==

=== First stamps ===

The postage stamp idea had already swept much of the world when, in September 1856, the Russian authorities decided to follow suit.

The first Russian postal stamp was issued on December 10, 1857, by the circular of the Postal Department &quot;On the bringing of postal stamps for the common use&quot; with the following content: &quot;Starting from the 1st January of the next year 1858 ordinary private letters to all the places of the Empire, the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Finland brought to the post in ordinary envelopes or without envelope at all just with addresses written on the letter itself should be sent only with the stamp corresponding to the letter weight&quot;. The first stamps went on sale on 10 December 1857, but officially people started to use stamps to pay internal correspondence in Russia from January 1, 1858 (from March 1, 1858 – in the Caucasus, Transcaucasia, and Siberia). Since this time all private letters have been sent only with postage stamps that were cancelled with two crossed lines.

Since the supply of postmarks to the numerous post offices took a while, the Postal Department ordered that stamps be cancelled with pen and ink, following the example of cancelling postal stationery envelopes.

===Later Russian Empire stamps===
A 5k stamp for local postage was introduced in 1863, and in the following year new common design, with the coat of arms in an oval, was introduced for the 1k, 3k, and 5k values. These were used to make up complicated rates for international mail, which had previously required cash payments at the post office.

After 1866 the stamps were printed on paper watermarked with a pattern of wavy lines, &quot;EZGB&quot; in Cyrillic plus a set of more or less horizontal lines [13 for the height of the letters!] and vertical lines running through the letters and halfway. Apart from that the &quot;grain&quot; of the paper was always perpendicular to the watermark text! In the early years, the horizontal watermark prevailed, but for a minority of each value, the grain was vertical. In later years the vertical watermark prevailed. Contrary to a common perception among collectors there was NO laid paper involved. The &quot;stripes&quot; were always part of the watermark.

In September 1865, the Shlisselburg district became the first of the &quot;zemstvo&quot; offices to issue stamps; the system was officially organized by a decree of 27 August 1870.

In 1874, Russia became one of the original 22 countries forming the General Postal Union (later the Universal Postal Union).

The coat of arms design was changed in 1875 and used for 2k and 8k values, and a 7k in 1879. The 7k was also printed on revenue stamp paper watermarked with a hexagonal pattern; these are quite rare.

A new issue of 14 December 1883 featured an updated design, lower values printed in a single color, and new high values – 14k, 35k, and 70k. January 1884 saw the introduction of 3.50-ruble and 7-ruble stamps, physically much larger than the existing stamps.

In 1889 the designs were changed again, this time to introduce thunderbolts across the posthorns underneath the double-headed eagle, and in printings, after 1902 the usual grain of the paper was changed to be vertical.

At the end of 1904, Russia issued its first semi-postal stamps. The four values were each sold at 3k over the face to provide for orphans of casualties in the Russo-Japanese War.

In 1909 a new series came out, using a mix of old and new designs, all printed on unwatermarked wove paper, and with lozenges on the face to discourage postage stamp reuse.

Russia&#x27;s first series of commemorative stamps appeared on 2 January 1913 to mark the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty. The 17 stamps featured portraits of the various Tsars, as well as views of the Kremlin, Winter Palace, and Romanov Castle. But in 1915 and 1916, as the government disintegrated under the pressures of World War I, several of the designs were printed on card stock and used as paper money. 7k and 14k stamps were also surcharged 10k and 20k due to shortages.

=== Revolution and Civil War period ===
The period of the Russian Revolution is complicated philatelically; post offices across the country were thrown on their own devices, and a number of the factions and breakaway republics issued new kinds of stamps, although in some cases they seem to have been as much for publicity purposes, few genuine uses having been recorded.

Entities issuing their own stamps include:
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Army of the Northwest
* Batum
* Belarus
* Estonia
* Far Eastern Republic
* Georgia
* Latvia
* Lithuania
* Siberia
* South Russia
* Transcaucasian SFSR
* West Ukrainian National Republic

In 1917 the Provisional Government reprinted the old Tsarist designs but sold them imperforate. The first stamps of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic appeared in 1918, as two values depicting a sword cutting a chain. While great quantities of these stamps survive, they saw little use, and used copies are worth more than mint.

In the years of the Civil War, postage stamps served as a kind of currency in a number of regions. During the later famine, postage stamps were used as a means of exchange for products. The &quot;Pravda&quot; newspaper issue of 9 March 1922 &quot;urged the population “not to throw away stamps” and called on all citizens and children of the RSFSR to gather and send all canceled stamps, stamp collections, and
anything they had on hand to be exchanged for chocolate and other products for starving children.&quot;

The next stamps appeared in 1921, after inflation had taken hold. The set&#x27;s values range from 1 to 1,000 rubles. By the next year, these stamps were being surcharged in various ways, with face values of up to 100,000 rubles.

A currency reform in 1922 that exchanged money at a 10,000-to-1 rate enabled new stamps in the 5r to 200r range, including a set marking the 5th anniversary of the October Revolution, Tsarist stamps surcharged with a five-pointed star containing a hammer and sickle. Stamps with portraits of a worker, peasant and soldier also appeared this year; variations on these portrait designs, including the Gold Standard issue, would continue to be issued throughout the 1920s.

==== Finnish occupation of Aunus ====
At 1919–1921 there was Aunus expedition where a group of Finnish volunteers occupied parts of East Karelia (Aunus in Finnish, Olonets Karelia in Russian). There were stamps issued for Aunus troops by local authorities. They were Finnish definitives from 1917 with overprint .

===Stamps of the Soviet Union===

Postage stamps of the USSR were issued in the period 1923 to 1991. They bore the specific inscription (&quot;Post of the USSR&quot;). The thematics of Soviet stamps mirrored to a large extent the history, politics, economics, and culture of this world&#x27;s first socialist state.

<text>Venera 16 ( meaning &quot;Venus 16&quot;) was a spacecraft sent to Venus by the Soviet Union. This uncrewed orbiter was to map the surface of Venus using high resolution imaging systems. The spacecraft was identical to Venera 15 and based on modifications to the earlier Venera space probes. The latest data from the spacecraft were received on June 13, 1985, when it responded to the signal sent from Earth for Vega 1.

==Mission profile==

Venera 16 was launched on June 7, 1983, at 02:32:00 UTC and reached Venus&#x27; orbit on October 11, 1983.

The spacecraft was inserted into Venus orbit a day apart from Venera 15, with its orbital plane shifted by an angle of approximately 4° relative to one another probe. This made it possible to reimage an area if necessary. The spacecraft was in a nearly polar orbit with a periapsis ~, at 62°N latitude, and apoapsis ~, with an inclination ~90°, the orbital period being ~24 hours.

Together with Venera 15, the spacecraft imaged the area from the north pole down to about 30°N latitude (i.e. approx. 25% of Venus surface) over the 8 months of mapping operations.

==Spacecraft structure==

The Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft were identical and were based on modifications to the orbiter portions of the Venera 9 and Venera 14 probes. Each spacecraft consisted of a long cylinder with a diameter, tall parabolic dish antenna for the synthetic aperture radar at one end. A diameter parabolic dish antenna for the radio altimeter was also located at this end. The electrical axis of the radio altimeter antenna was lined up with the axis of the cylinder. The electrical axis of the SAR deviated from the spacecraft axis by 10 degrees. During imaging, the radio altimeter would be lined up with the center of the planet (local vertical) and the SAR would be looking off to the side at 10 degrees. A bulge at the opposite end of the cylinder held fuel tanks and propulsion units. Two square solar arrays extended like wings from the sides of the cylinder. A radio dish antenna for communications was also attached to the side of the cylinder. The spacecraft each weighed .

Both Venera 15 and 16 were equipped with a synthetic aperture radar. A radar was necessary in this mission because nothing else would be able to penetrate the dense clouds of Venus. The probes were equipped with on board computers that saved the images until the entire image was complete.

List of spacecraft instruments and experiments:
* Polyus-V Synthetic Aperture Radar
* Omega Radar Altimeter
* Infrared Fourier Spectrometer
* Cosmic-Ray Detectors (6 sensors)
* Solar-Plasma Detectors

To get to Venus, Venera 16 was placed in a heliocentric orbit with perihelion of 0.71 astronomical units, aphelion of 1.01 astronomical units, eccentricity of 0.17, orbital inclination of 2.3 degrees and orbital period of 293 days.

The Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft were identical and were based on modifications to the Venera 9 orbiter and the Venera 14 carrier spacecraft. Each spacecraft consisted of a long cylinder with a diameter, tall parabolic dish antenna for the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) at one end. A 1-meter diameter parabolic dish antenna for the radio altimeter was also located at this end. The electrical axis of the radio altimeter antenna was lined up with the axis of the cylinder.

Both Venera 15 and 16 were equipped with a synthetic-aperture radar (SAR). A radar was necessary in this mission because nothing else would be able to penetrate the dense clouds of Venus. The probes were equipped with on board computers that saved the images until the entire image was complete. This radar system replaced the normal landers that previous Venera probes brought to Venus.

<text>William Kreutzmann Jr. ( ; born May 7, 1946) is an American drummer and founding member of the rock band Grateful Dead. He played with the band for its entire thirty-year career, usually alongside fellow drummer Mickey Hart, and has continued to perform with former members of the Grateful Dead in various lineups, and with his own bands BK3, 7 Walkers and Billy &amp; the Kids.

==Early life==

Kreutzmann was born in Palo Alto, California, the son of Janice Beryl (née Shaughnessy) and William Kreutzmann Sr. His father was of German descent. His maternal grandfather was football coach and innovator Clark Shaughnessy.

Kreutzmann started playing drums at the age of 13. At first he practiced on a Slingerland drum kit lent to him. As a teenager, he was practicing drums alone in a large building at his high school when Aldous Huxley and another man walked in. Huxley told Kreutzmann he had never heard anything like it, and encouraged him in his drumming – despite the fact Kreutzmann had been told by his sixth grade music teacher that he could not keep a beat. Kreutzmann continued to practice a great deal. His earliest enthusiasm was for the music of Ray Charles and other R&amp;B musicians. He has explained that later he learned some advanced technique or tricks from Mickey Hart.

Kreutzmann listened to jazz groups in clubs when he found an opportunity for an under-age guy to get in. After joining the Warlocks (later called the Grateful Dead), bassist Phil Lesh introduced him to the work of one of the top jazz drummers of the time, Elvin Jones. Kreutzmann became an enthusiast, also, for the funk music of The Meters.

==Grateful Dead==
At the end of 1964 Kreutzmann co-founded the band the Warlocks, along with Dana Morgan, Jr. (who was soon replaced by Phil Lesh), Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, and Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan. Their first gig was May 5, 1965, two days before Kreutzmann&#x27;s nineteenth birthday. During the band&#x27;s early days, Kreutzmann sometimes used a fake draft card with the name &quot;Bill Sommers&quot; to be admitted to bars where the band was playing, since he was underage. In November 1965, the Warlocks became the Grateful Dead.

Meeting fellow percussionist Mickey Hart in the fall of 1967 had a big impact on Kreutzmann&#x27;s career. Hart soon joined the Dead, making it one of the first (and few) rock bands to feature two drummers. The combination of their playing was an important part of the band&#x27;s sound and earned them the nickname &quot;the Rhythm Devils&quot; (the name being quipped to them by Francis Ford Coppola). Their lengthy drum duets were a feature of nearly every show from 1978 to 1995, and are documented in a number of recordings by the band.

During the 1980s Kreutzmann formed and performed with three side-bands: The Billy Kreutzmann All-stars, Kokomo, and Go Ahead, mostly playing San Francisco Bay Area clubs, although Go Ahead toured somewhat in 1986–87. The All-Stars were Kreutzmann, David Nelson, guitar, Larry Murphy, Sr. on fiddle and Larry Murphy, Jr. on bass. Kokomo and Go Ahead featured Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland. David Margen played bass for Kokomo as well as Go Ahead. Kevin Russell was guitarist for Kokomo. Another brief early-80s configuration was billed as the &quot;Kreutzmann-Margen Band.&quot;

Kreutzmann remained with the Grateful Dead until its dissolution after the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, making him one of four members to play at every one of the band&#x27;s 2,300 shows, along with Garcia, Weir and Lesh.

In 1994, Kreutzmann and the other members of the Grateful Dead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 2007, they won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Post-Grateful Dead==
Kreutzmann&#x27;s first post-Grateful Dead musical project was Backbone, a trio with guitarist Rick Barnett and bassist Edd Cook. They released one album, &quot;Backbone&quot;, in 1998.

In June 1997 Kreutzmann pleaded no contest in Kauai, Hawaii to charges of beating his former girlfriend at the home they shared. He served two days in jail.

In 1998, former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart formed a band called the Other Ones, which played a number of shows as part of the Furthur Festival. The band did not play live in 1999. In 2000, Kreutzmann joined The Other Ones.

The band, with Kreutzmann, toured in 2000 and 2002.

In 2003, they changed their name to The Dead. The Dead played a number of live concerts in 2003, 2004 and 2009. Kreutzmann collaborated with Journey guitarist Neal Schon, Sy Klopps, Ira Walker, and Ralph Woodson to form the Trichromes in 2002. They released an EP, &quot;Dice with the Universe&quot;, and an album, &quot;Trichromes&quot;.

On December 17, 2005, he participated in the 17th Annual Warren Haynes Christmas Jam as the drummer for SerialPod, a group which also included Phish members Trey Anastasio and Mike Gordon.

During 2006, Kreutzmann teamed up with fellow Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, Phish bassist Mike Gordon, and former The Other Ones guitarist Steve Kimock to form the Rhythm Devils. The band features songs from their respective former bands as well as new songs written by Jerry Garcia&#x27;s songwriting companion Robert Hunter. The Rhythm Devils played their first tour in 2006, which ended at the popular Vegoose festival in Las Vegas, Nevada over the Halloween weekend. In 2008 they released a DVD called &quot;The Rhythm Devils Concert Experience&quot;.
In 2008, Kreutzmann toured the eastern United States with bassist Oteil Burbridge of the Allman Brothers Band and guitarist Scott Murawski of Max Creek as BK3.

In 2009, Burbridge was replaced by former Neville Brothers and longtime Bonnie Raitt bassist James &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson. Hutchinson had performed with Kreutzmann, Papa Mali and keyboardist Matt Hubbard earlier in the year at a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Haiku on the island of Maui. Some 2009 shows also featured Donna the Buffalo singer/instrumentalist Tara Nevins. In February 2010 the trio played several concerts with Burbridge again assuming the bassist role. On August 2, 2009, Kreutzmann played with Phish during most of the second set at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Along with other members of The Dead, he also visited the White House and met with President Obama.

In 2010, Kreutzmann formed a new band, called 7 Walkers, with guitarist Papa Mali, multi-instrumentalist Matt Hubbard, and bassist Reed Mathis. They toured the southern U.S. in the spring of 2010, with George Porter Jr. playing bass while Mathis toured with Tea Leaf Green. 7 Walkers has recorded a studio album which was released on November 2, 2010.

In October 2014, Kreutzmann announced he had formed a new band, called Billy &amp; the Kids, which would begin performing live in December. The other band members are Reed Mathis on bass, Aron Magner of the Disco Biscuits on keyboards, and Tom Hamilton Jr. of American Babies on guitar and vocals.

Kreutzmann&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Deal: My Three Decades of Drumming, Dreams, and Drugs with the Grateful Dead&quot;, was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press on May 5, 2015.

In 2015, Kreutzmann formed Dead &amp; Company with former Grateful Dead members Weir and Hart, with other members including Jeff Chimenti, Otiel Burbridge, and John Mayer. They toured from 2015 to 2019, in the fall of 2021, as well as in the summer of 2022. In September 2022, Dead &amp; Company announced the Final Tour, which would take place in Summer 2023, and would be their last. On April 22, 2023, Dead &amp; Company released a statement stating Kreutzmann would not be performing these final tour dates, due to a &quot;shift in creative direction&quot;.

==Visual arts==
In 1995, Kreutzmann produced a film called &quot;Ocean Spirit&quot;. The film is a documentary about the six-week expedition that involved a 3,000-mile ocean voyage from San Francisco to the Revillagigedo Islands, 400 miles southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Kreutzmann is featured in the film and was the executive producer. Wesley C. Skiles, noted underwater filmmaker, wrote and directed the project. &quot;We went with no preconceived notions,&quot; says Kreutzmann, &quot;except that we were committed to the concept of nonintrusive interaction. We were seeking a way to go beyond our own boundaries as human beings, to meet with the creatures of the sea on their terms. And I hoped somehow to combine film and music to capture that moment of contact.&quot; 
The film has a strong environmental message and &quot;exquisite photography&quot;, wrote John Metzger of the Music Box.

Kreutzmann also does work as a visual artist that began in 1993 when he acquired his first computer, a Powerbook 540C with Photoshop installed. Jerry Garcia, already a proficient computer artist, taught Kreutzmann the basics.
In 2001, he began releasing limited edition reproductions of his digital artwork. His work can be found at Walnut Street Gallery.

==Political activism==
On October 29, 2010, Kreutzmann endorsed Proposition 19, which would have legalized marijuana in California. Kreutzmann made the endorsement on the California Marijuana Report radio show. &quot;I smoke marijuana and I&#x27;m not a criminal; please vote Yes on 19&quot;, Kreutzmann told Eric Brenner, the show&#x27;s host. &quot;Jerry Garcia would have voted Yes,&quot; he added.

<text>Clarence House is a royal residence on The Mall in the City of Westminster, London. It was built in 1825–1827, adjacent to St James&#x27;s Palace, for the royal Duke of Clarence, the future King William IV.

The four-storey house is faced in pale render. Over the years, it has undergone much extensive remodelling and reconstruction, most notably after being heavily damaged in the Second World War by enemy bombing during The Blitz. Little remains of the original structure designed by John Nash. It is Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England. The house is open to visitors for about one month each summer, usually in August.

Clarence House serves as the London residence of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. It has been Charles&#x27;s residence since 2003. From 1953 until 2002 it was home to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and before her, it was the official home of her daughter, Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen Elizabeth II.

==History==
The house was built between 1825 and 1827 to a design by John Nash. It was commissioned by the Duke of Clarence, who in 1830 became King William IV of the United Kingdom (reigned 1830–1837). He moved there in preference to the adjoining St James&#x27;s Palace, an antiquated Tudor building which he found too cramped.
When he became king, he remained at Clarence House, in preference to Buckingham Palace, and had John Nash create a direct passageway into the State Apartments of St James&#x27;s Palace, where he could conduct royal business. Built on palace grounds, Clarence House faces greenspace and The Mall and is next to Stable Yard road, across which lies Lancaster House.

From William IV, the house passed to his sister Princess Augusta Sophia, and, following her death in 1840, to Queen Victoria&#x27;s mother, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Duchess of Kent. In 1866 it became the London home of Queen Victoria&#x27;s second son, Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (also Duke of Edinburgh), until his death in 1900.

Queen Victoria&#x27;s third son, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, used the house from 1900 until his death in 1942. During his tenure, for a brief period in the 1930s, it was the location of the library of the School of Oriental and African Studies, until all universities in London were evacuated in 1939 and the school temporarily relocated to Cambridge.

During World War II, Clarence House suffered damage by enemy bombing during the Blitz (1940–1941). Following the death of the Duke of Connaught in 1942, it was used by the Red Cross and the St John Ambulance Brigade as their headquarters during the rest of World War II.

After their marriage in 1947, it became the residence of Princess Elizabeth and her husband, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Their daughter, Princess Anne, was born there in August 1950. Princess Elizabeth acceded to the throne as Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 and moved to Buckingham Palace the following year; her mother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and sister, Princess Margaret, moved into Clarence House.

Princess Margaret later moved into an apartment in Kensington Palace following her marriage in 1960, whilst the Queen Mother remained in residence at Clarence House until her death in March 2002. Charles, at that time Prince of Wales, took up residence in 2003. Clarence House was also the official residence of Prince William from 2003 until April 2011, and of Prince Harry from 2003 until March 2012.

Currently, Clarence House is the London residence of King Charles III and his wife, Queen Camilla. They intend to continue to use Clarence House as their London home until at least 2027 during renovations to Buckingham Palace. Buckingham Palace will remain the administrative headquarters for the monarchy and the location of state events during this time.

<doc id="390945" wikidata="Q545457" url="?curid=390945" title="Nieuw-Vennep">
<text>Nieuw-Vennep is a town in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is located near the capital city Amsterdam as well as Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. It has a population of 31,415 (2021), and is a part of the municipality of Haarlemmermeer, which ranks in top 15% of Dutch municipalities by income level.

== Geography and demographics ==
Nieuw-Vennep has 31,415 inhabitants (2021). The town has two districts, the Old Town and the newly built Getsewoud, with each being home to around half the town&#x27;s population.

In 2001, before the development of Getsewoud, Nieuw-Vennep had 17,886 inhabitants. The development of Getsewoud doubled the number of homes in the town and the population followed soon after.

The built-up area of the town was 3.71 km2, and contained 7,513 residences. The wider statistical area of Nieuw-Vennep has a population of around 40,000.

== History ==

Northwest of present-day Nieuw-Vennep lay the island &quot;Vennip&quot; or &quot;Vennep&quot;, to which Nieuw-Vennep owes its name, meaning &quot;New Vennep&quot;. Nieuw-Vennep is one of two towns officially founded after the lake Haarlemmermeer was made into a dry land polder in 1852. The other town was Hoofddorp, at the time still named Kruisdorp. Until 1868 Nieuw-Vennep was called Venneperdorp, both towns have used their current name since that time.

The first inhabitants were farm laborers living under poor circumstances. As a result of the conditions, the town was nicknamed &quot;De Krim&quot;, in reference to the Crimea war fought between 1853 and 1856. As Hoofddorp became the governmental and economic center of the municipality, the development of Nieuw-Vennep lagged behind. On 2 November 1862 the construction of a new church (&quot;De Witte Kerk&quot;) was initiated by the Dutch Reformed Church.

== Economics ==
The municipality of Haarlemmermeer, of which Nieuw-Vennep is a part, ranks in the top 15% of the country&#x27;s richest municipalities by income level. Nieuw-Vennep is located close to Amsterdam, as well as the main airport of the country which provides around 65,000 jobs. Many people who work in Amsterdam or other nearby cities, have chosen to settle in Nieuw-Vennep for its peacefulness and family-friendly facilities.

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, it was also one of the economically hardest-hit regions, with its GDP shrinking 28% as the nearby airport Schiphol suffered a big blow.

== Transport ==
Besides several bus lines going in and out, there is also the Railway station Nieuw-Vennep, which includes a 10-minute train ride to Schiphol, a 30 min ride to Amsterdam Central station, and other destinations.

==Trivia==
*The town of Nieuw-Vennep is mentioned at the beginning of the Ash song Jack Names the Planets.
==Notable people from Nieuw Vennep==

* Mitchell Donald (1988) a Surinamese professional footballer who previously played for AFC Ajax
* Calvin Stengs (1998) a Dutch professional footballer who is currently playing for Feyenoord

<text>The Nimbus satellites were second-generation U.S. robotic spacecraft launched between 1964 and 1978 used for meteorological research and development. The spacecraft were designed to serve as stabilized, Earth-oriented platforms for the testing of advanced systems to sense and collect atmospheric science data. Seven Nimbus spacecraft have been launched into near-polar, Sun-synchronous orbits beginning with Nimbus 1 on August 28, 1964. On board the Nimbus satellites are various instrumentation for imaging, sounding, and other studies in different spectral regions. The Nimbus satellites were launched aboard Thor-Agena rockets (Nimbus 1–4) and Delta rockets (Nimbus 5–7).

Over a 20-year period from the launch of the first satellite, the Nimbus series of missions was the United States&#x27; primary research and development platform for satellite remote sensing of the Earth. The seven Nimbus satellites, launched over a fourteen-year period, shared their space-based observations of the planet for thirty years. NASA transferred the technology tested and refined by the Nimbus missions to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for its operational satellite instruments. The technology and lessons learned from the Nimbus missions are the heritage of most of the Earth-observing satellites NASA and NOAA have launched over the past three decades.

==Contributions==

===Weather forecasting===

At the time of its launch, the idea that intangible properties such as air pressure could be observed using a satellite orbiting hundreds of miles above the Earth was revolutionary. With each Nimbus mission, scientists broadened their ability to collect atmospheric characteristics that improved weather forecasting, including ocean and air temperatures, air pressure, and cloudiness. Beginning with the Nimbus 3 satellite in 1969, temperature information through the atmospheric column began to be retrieved by satellites from the eastern Atlantic and most of the Pacific Ocean, which led to significant forecast improvements. The global coverage provided by Nimbus satellites made accurate 3–5 day forecasts possible for the first time.

The ability of the Nimbus satellites to detect electromagnetic energy in multiple wavelengths (multi-spectral data), in particular the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, made it possible for scientists to look into the atmosphere and tell the difference between water vapor and liquid water in clouds. In addition, they were able to measure atmospheric temperature even in the presence of clouds, a capability that allowed scientists to take the temperature in the &quot;warm core&quot; of hurricanes.

===Radiation budget===
One of the most important scientific contributions of the Nimbus missions was their measurements of the Earth&#x27;s radiation budget. For the first time, scientists had global, direct observations of the amount of solar radiation entering and exiting the Earth system. The observations helped to verify and refine the earliest climate models, and are still making important contributions to the study of climate change. As scientists consider the causes and effects of global warming, Nimbus radiation budget data provide a base for long-term analyses and make change-detection studies possible. The Nimbus technology gave rise to current radiation-budget sensors, such as the CERES instruments on NASA&#x27;s Terra and Aqua satellites.

===Ozone layer===
Even before the Nimbus satellites began collecting their observations of Earth&#x27;s ozone layer, scientists had some understanding of the processes that maintained or destroyed it. They were pretty sure they understood how the layer formed, and they knew from laboratory experiments that halogens could destroy ozone. Finally, weather balloons had revealed that the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere changed over time, and scientists suspected weather phenomena or seasonal change were responsible. But how all of these pieces of information worked together on a global scale was still unclear.

Scientists conducted experiments from NASA experimental aircraft and proved that atmospheric chemicals such as the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) released from refrigerants and aerosol sprays did destroy ozone. As Nimbus 7 satellite observations accumulated between 1978 and 1994, it became increasingly clear that CFCs were creating an ozone hole each winter season over Antarctica. Not only that, but despite some year-to-year variations, it appeared the hole was becoming larger. The Nimbus measurements made clear how severe the ozone hole problem was.

===Sea ice===
Nimbus satellites collected orbital data on the extent of the polar caps in the mid-1960s, recorded in the visible and infrared parts of the spectrum. These first global snapshots of Earth&#x27;s icecaps provide invaluable reference points for climate change studies. During a narrowing window of opportunity for data archaeology, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NDISC) and NASA were able to recover data that allowed the reconstruction of high-resolution Nimbus 2 images from 1966 showing the entire Arctic and Antarctic ice caps.

When the Nimbus 5 spacecraft launched in 1972, scientists planned for its Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer to collect global observations of where and how much it rained across the world. However, a new priority for the sensor evolved in the months following its launch: mapping global sea ice concentrations. When Nimbus 7 launched in 1978, technology had improved enough for scientists to distinguish newly formed (i.e., &quot;first year&quot;) sea ice from older ice, with the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) sensor. The data it collected during its 9-year lifespan provide a significant chunk of the long-term record of Earth&#x27;s sea ice concentration that today&#x27;s scientists use for studies of climate change.

Among the most serendipitous discoveries that the Nimbus missions made possible was that of a gaping hole in the sea ice around Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere winters of 1974–76. In a phenomenon that has not been observed since, an enormous, ice-free patch of water, called a polynya, developed three years in a row in the seasonal ice that encases Antarctica each winter. Located in the Weddell Sea, each year the polynya vanished with the summer melt, but returned the following year. The open patch of water may have influenced ocean temperatures as far down as 2,500 meters and influenced ocean circulation over a wide area. The Weddell Sea Polynya has not been observed since the event witnessed by the Nimbus satellites in the mid-70s.

===Global positioning system===
Nimbus satellites (beginning with Nimbus 3 in 1969) blazed the trail into the modern GPS era with operational search and rescue and data collection systems. The satellites tested the first technology that allowed satellites to locate weather-observation stations set up in remote locations and to command the stations to transmit their data back to the satellite. The most famous demonstration of the new technology was through the record-breaking flight of British aviator Sheila Scott, who tested the Nimbus navigation and locator communication system when she made the first-ever solo flight over the North Pole in 1971.

The Nimbus ground-to-satellite-to-ground communication system demonstrated the first satellite-based search and rescue system. Among the earliest successes were the rescue of two hot air balloonists who went down in the North Atlantic in 1977 and, later that year, tracking a Japanese adventurer on his first attempt to be the first person to dogsled solo to the North Pole through Greenland. Tens of thousands of people over the past three decades have been rescued through the Search and Rescue Satellite-aided Tracking (SARSAT) operational system on NOAA satellites.

===Nuclear power===
Nimbus-3 was the first satellite to use a SNAP-19 radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) in space. A previous attempt was made to launch a SNAP-19 RTG on Nimbus-B-1, but the rocket was destroyed and the nuclear fuel landed in the Santa Barbara Channel. Later, the fuel was recovered from the wreckage at a depth of and re-purposed for Nimbus-3 as the SNAP-19B. This power source augmented the solar array with an additional of electrical power.

<doc id="390957" wikidata="Q23889472" url="?curid=390957" title="Cleopatra's Needles">
<text>Cleopatra&#x27;s Needles are a separated pair of ancient Egyptian obelisks now in London and New York City. The obelisks were originally made in Heliopolis (modern Cairo) during the New Kingdom period, inscribed by the 18th dynasty pharaoh Thutmose III and 19th dynasty pharaoh Ramesses II. In 13/12 BCE they were moved to the Caesareum of Alexandria by the prefect of Egypt Publius Rubrius Barbarus. Since at least the 17th century the obelisks have usually been named in the West after the Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII. They stood in Alexandria for almost two millennia until they were re-erected in London and New York City in 1878 and 1881 respectively. Together with Pompey&#x27;s Pillar, they were described in the 1840s in David Roberts&#x27; &quot;Egypt and Nubia&quot; as &quot;[the] most striking monuments of ancient Alexandria&quot;.

The removal of the obelisks from Egypt was presided over by Isma&#x27;il Pasha, who had greatly indebted the Khedivate of Egypt during its rapid modernization. The London needle was presented to the United Kingdom in 1819, but remained in Alexandria until 1877 when Sir William James Erasmus Wilson, a distinguished anatomist and dermatologist, sponsored its transportation to London.

In the same year, Elbert E. Farman, the then-United States Consul General at Cairo, secured the other needle for the United States. The needle was transported by Henry Honychurch Gorringe. Both Wilson and Gorringe published books commemorating the transportation of the Needles: Wilson wrote &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle: With Brief Notes on Egypt and Egyptian Obelisks&quot; (1877) and Gorringe wrote &quot;Egyptian Obelisks&quot; (1885).

The London needle was placed on the Victoria Embankment, which had been built a few years earlier in 1870, whilst the New York needle was placed in Central Park just outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s main building, also built just a few years earlier in 1872.

Damage to the obelisks by weather conditions in London and New York has been studied, notably by Professor Erhard M. Winkler of the University of Notre Dame. Zahi Hawass, a former Egyptian Minister of Antiquities, has called for their restoration or repatriation.

==Alexandria==

The name &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Needles&quot; derives from the French name, &quot;Les aiguilles de Cléopâtre&quot;, when they stood in Alexandria.

The earliest known post-classical reference to the obelisks was by the Cairo-based traveller Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi in c.1200 CE, who according to E. A. Wallis Budge described them as &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s big needles&quot;. At this point, both obelisks were still standing – it is thought that the toppling of one of the obelisks happened during the 1303 Crete earthquake, which also damaged the nearby Lighthouse of Alexandria.

George Sandys wrote of his 1610 journey: &quot;Of Antiquities there are few remainders: onely an Hieroglyphicall Obelisk of Theban marble, as hard welnigh as Porphir, but of a deeper red, and speckled alike, called Pharos Needle, standing where once stood the pallace of Alexander: and another lying by, and like it, halfe buried in rubbidge.&quot; Two decades later, another English traveller Henry Blount wrote &quot;Within on the North towards the Sea are two square obeliskes each of one intire stone, full of Egyptian Hieroglyphicks, the one standing, the other fallen, I thinke either of them thrice as bigge as that at Constantinople, or the other at Rome, &amp; therefore left behind as too heavy for transportation: neere these obeliskes, are the ruines of Cleopatraes Palace high upon the shore, with the private Gate, whereat she received her Marke Antony after their overthrow at Actium&quot;.

In 1735, the former French consul in Egypt, Benoît de Maillet, wrote in his &quot;Description de l&#x27;Egypte&quot;:
Cleopatra&#x27;s Needles: After this famous monument, the oldest and most curious in modern Alexandria are these two Needles, or Obelisks, which are attributed to Cleopatra, without anyone knowing too well on what basis. One is now overturned, and almost buried under the sands; the other still remains upright.

In 1755, Frederic Louis Norden wrote in his &quot;Voyage d&#x27;Egypte et de Nubie&quot; that:
Some ancient authors have written that these two Obelisks were found in their time in the Palace of Cleopatra; but they do not tell us who had placed them there. It is believed that these monuments are much older than the City of Alexandria, and that they were brought from some place in Egypt, to decorate this Palace. This conjecture is well founded, as we know that at the time of the foundation of Alexandria, these monuments covered with hieroglyphs were no longer made, the understanding and use of which had already been lost long before.

Images from 18th and 19th century Alexandria show two needles, one standing and the other fallen. The London needle was the fallen needle.

The location is now the site of a statue of Egyptian statesman Saad Zaghloul.

== London needle ==

The London needle is in the City of Westminster, on the Victoria Embankment near the Golden Jubilee Bridges.

In 1819, Muhammad Ali Pasha gave Britain the fallen obelisk as a gift. However, Britain&#x27;s prime minister at the time, Lord Liverpool, hesitated on having it brought to the country due to shipping expenses.

Two prior suggestions had been made to transport the needle to London – in 1832 and in the 1850s after the Great Exhibition; however, neither proceeded.

In 1867, James Edward Alexander was inspired on a visit to Paris&#x27; Place de la Concorde to arrange for an equivalent monument in London. He stated that he was informed that the owner of the land in Alexandria where the British needle lay had proposed to break it up for building material. Alexander campaigned to arrange for the transportation. In 1876 he went to Egypt and met Isma&#x27;il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt, together with Edward Stanton then the British Consul-General. Alexander&#x27;s friend, William James Erasmus Wilson, agreed to cover the costs of the transportation, which took place in October 1877.

On September 7, 1940, the pedestal of the needle and one of its surrounding sphinxes were scarred by debris cast by a nearby bomb, dropped by a Luftwaffe plane as part of The Blitz. The damage is still visible today, and a plaque on the western sphinx records the event.

== New York needle ==

In 1869, at the opening of the Suez Canal, Isma&#x27;il Pasha suggested to American journalist William Henry Hurlbert the possible transportation of an obelisk from Egypt to the United States.

The New York City needle was erected in Central Park, just west of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, on 22 February 1881. It was secured in May 1877 by judge Elbert E. Farman, the then-United States Consul General at Cairo, as a gift from the Khedive for the United States remaining a friendly neutral as the European powers – France and Britain – maneuvered to secure political control of the Egyptian Government.

<text>The Lahn () is a , right (or eastern) tributary of the Rhine in Germany. Its course passes through the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia (23.0 km), Hesse (165.6 km), and Rhineland-Palatinate (57.0 km).

It has its source in the Rothaargebirge, the highest part of the Sauerland, in North Rhine-Westphalia. The Lahn meets the Rhine at Lahnstein, near Koblenz. Important cities along the Lahn include Marburg, Gießen, Wetzlar, Limburg an der Lahn, Weilburg and Bad Ems.

Tributaries to the Lahn include the Ohm, Dill, the Weil and the Aar. The lower Lahn has many dams with locks, allowing regular shipping from its mouth up to Runkel. Riverboats also operate on a small section north of the dam in Gießen.

==Source area==
The Lahn is a -long, right (or eastern) tributary of the Rhine in Germany. Its course passes through the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia (23.0 km), Hesse (165.6 km), and Rhineland-Palatinate (57.0 km).

The Lahn originates at the Lahnhof, a locality of Nenkersdorf, which is a constituent community of Netphen in southeastern North Rhine-Westphalia, near the border with Hesse. The source area is situated along the Eisenstraße scenic highway and the Rothaarsteig hiking trail.

The river arises in the southeastern Rothaargebirge in the Ederkopf-Lahnkopf-Rücken ridge-line natural area. This ridge is the drainage divide between the Rhine and Weser, and, within the Rhine system, the watershed between the rivers Lahn and Sieg.

The source is at an elevation of and is located southwest of the high Lahnkopf. In the vicinity are also the origins of the Eder (5.5 km northwest of the Lahnhof) and the Sieg (another 3 km north). Whereas the Sieg takes the shortest route to the Rhine (to the west), the Lahn first runs in the opposite direction, paralleling the Eder for many kilometers.

==Course==
The Lahn first flows in a northeasterly direction through the southeastern Rothaargebirge and its foothills. From about the Bad Laasphe community of Feudingen, it turns primarily to the east.

===Upper Lahntal and Wetschaft Depression===
 The section of the Lahn below the town of Bad Laasphe is geographically known as the Upper Lahn Valley (German: Ober Lahntal). Above Bad Laasphe, where the river flows between the Rothaargebirge on the left (i.e. to the north) and the Gladenbach Uplands on the right, the Lahn Valley is simply considered part of these mountains.

Between Niederlaasphe (of Bad Laasphe) and Wallau (of Biedenkopf), the river crosses the border between North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse. It then flows in an easterly direction through some districts of Biedenkopf (but not the central town) and the towns of Dautphetal and Lahntal. It is joined from the right by the Perf at Wallau and at Friedensdorf (of Dautphetal) by the Dautphe (which flows in a side valley to the south).

Shortly after the village of Caldern (of Lahn Valley), the ridgeline of the Rothaargebirge on the north ends with the Wollenberg and that of the Gladenbach Bergland with the Hungert. The Lahn leaves the Rhenish Slate Mountains for a long section and reaches the West Hesse Highlands, where it flows through the extreme south of the Wetschaft Depression, north of the Marburger Rücken. Where the Wetschaft flows into it from the Burgwald forest in the north (near the Lahntal village of Göttingen), the Lahn immediately changes direction by 90° to the right.

=== Marburg-Gießen Lahntal ===
The now southward-flowing Lahn then enters the Marburg-Gießen Lahntal. Shortly before Cölbe, the Ohm enters from the left at the &quot;Lahn-Knie&quot; named area. Flowing from the Vogelsberg through the &quot;Ohmtal&quot;, the Ohm is the Lahn&#x27;s longest tributary, with a length of .

The river then breaks through a sandstone mesa (the Marburger Rücken to the west and the Lahnberge to the east) into a valley which encompasses the entire territory of the city of Marburg and its suburbs. The valley begins after the river passes the Marburger Rücken near Niederweimar, where the Allna enters from the right. At the valley&#x27;s southern end, the Zwesten Ohm enters from the Lahnberge. The right (western) side of the valley is again formed by the Gladenbacher Bergland, from which the Salzböde enters the Lahn. On the left rises the Lumda Plateau, from which the eponymous river Lumda flows into the Lahn near Lollar. Gradually the valley widens into the Gießen Basin.

In Gießen, after the inflow of the Wieseck from the left, the Lahn&#x27;s general direction of flow changes from the south to the west. The Gießen Basin extends a few more miles downstream to Atzbach, a suburb of Lahnau. From the 1960s until the 1980s, there was extensive gravel mining in this area. The area between Heuchelheim, Lahnau, and the Wetzlar borough of Dutenhofen was to be completely mined and a water sports center with an Olympic-suitable rowing course built. This plan was partly realized, and the Heuchelheim Lake and Dutenhofen Lake are now popular recreational destinations for the surrounding region. Nature conservation organizations, however, were able to prevent further gravel mining, so the area is now one of the largest nature reserves in Hesse. Dutenhofen Lake marks Kilometer 0 of the Lahn as a federal waterway.

The Gießen Basin is surrounded by the mountain peaks of the Gleiberg, the Vetzberg, the Dünsberg, and the Schiffenberg. At Wetzlar, the Lahn is joined by its second longest tributary, the Dill, which has a length of . At this location, the valleys of the Lahn and Dill separate three parts of the Rhenish Slate Mountains from each other: the Gladenbach Bergland, the Westerwald to the northwest, and the Taunus to the south.

===Weilburg Lahntal===
After Wetzlar, the valley of the Lahn gradually narrows and at Leun enters the Weilburger Lahntal. The Weilburger Lahntal belongs to the larger Gießen-Koblenzer Lahntal physiographic province, considered part of the Rhenish Slate Mountains.

In the upper area of the Weilburg Lahntal (the Löhnberg Basin) are mineral springs, such as the famous Selters mineral spring in the municipality of Löhnberg. In the lower area, where the river turns again to the south, the Lahn is entrenched canyon-like below the level of the surrounding geographic trough.

The city of Weilburg is wrapped by a marked loop of the river. The neck of this noose is traversed by a boat tunnel, unique in Germany. A little below Weilburg, the Weil, originating in the High Taunus, enters the Lahn.

===Limburger Basin===
At Aumenau in the municipality of Villmar, the course of the Lahn reverses to the west again and enters the fertile Limburger Basin, where the river is incised to a depth of about . Here the river is joined by two tributaries, the Emsbach coming from the Taunus and the Elbbach from the Westerwald. In this area are frequent outcroppings of Devonian limestone, the so-called Lahn Marble (German: &quot;Lahnmarmor&quot;), such as at Limburg an der Lahn, where the Limburg Cathedral crowns such an outcropping. At Limburg, the river again enters a wider valley.

===Lower Lahntal===
Below Diez, the Lahn absorbs the Aar from the south. At Fachingen in the municipality of Birlenbach, it leaves the Limburger Basin and enters the Lower Lahntal. Its course is incised over deep in the Slate Mountains. Near Obernhof, the Gelbach enters the Lahn opposite Arnstein Abbey. Then, after passing Nassau and Bad Ems, where, as in Fachingen, mineral springs (sources of Emser salt) can be found, it completes its run, entering the Rhine in Lahnstein, located five kilometers south of Koblenz at an elevation of .

==History==

===Early history===

The Lahn area was settled as early as in the Stone Age, as shown by archeological finds near Diez, in Steeden in the community of Runkel, and in Wetzlar. Recent discoveries in Dalheim on the western edge of Wetzlar show a ca. 7000-year-old Linear Pottery culture settlement. There are also remains a Germanic settlement in the location, dated to around the 1st century, situated above a bend of the Lahn.

In the Roman Era, the Lahn presumably was used by the Romans to supply their fort at Bad Ems, Kastell Ems. Here the &quot;Limes Germanicus&quot; on the borders of Germania Superior and Rhaetia crossed the Lahn. Archaeological finds are known from Niederlahnstein, as well as from Lahnau. One Lahnau site, the Waldgirmes Forum in the community of Waldgirmes, was discovered in the 1990s and had been the site of a Roman town. Another site in the community of Dorlar has the remains of a Roman marching camp (or &quot;castra&quot;). These Lahnau sites have significant altered the current understanding of the history of the Romans east of the Rhine and north of the &quot;Limes&quot;.

During the Migration Period, the Alamanni settled in the lower Lahntal. They were later ousted by the Franks.

The origin and meaning of the name Lahn are uncertain; it is possible that it is a pre-Germanic word. The form of the name changed over time; before 600, variations like Laugona, Logana, Logene or Loyn are typical. The oldest known use of the current spelling of the name dates to 1365.

The oldest mention of the staple right of Diez dates to the early 14th century and is an indication of significant shipping on the Lahn by that time. In 1559, John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg laid out a towpath on the lower Lahn. In 1606, for the first time, the Lahn was deepened to allow small scale shipping and the lower reaches became navigable for four to five months of the year. However, there were numerous weirs with only narrow gaps, so the traffic remained restricted to small boats.

In the 17th and early 18th centuries, there were several initiatives of adjacent princes to further expand the Lahn as a waterway, but they all failed due to lack of coordination. In 1740, the Archbishopric of Trier began construction to make the mouth of the Lahn passable for larger vessels. In winter of 1753/54, bank stabilization and creation of towpaths were done along the entire length of the river. Then the river was passable for vessels with up to 240 hundredweights of cargo downstream and up to 160 hundredweights upstream.

By the end of the 19th century, over 300 castles, fortresses, fortified churches, and similar buildings were built along the river.

===Shipping during the Industrial Revolution===
During the French occupation, inspections of the river began in 1796, which were to be followed by a comprehensive expansion. Due to political developments, however, this expansion did not take place. The newly created Duchy of Nassau eventually began work from 1808 under the Chief Construction Inspector of Kirn to make the Lahn fully navigable. In the first winter, the section of the riverside from the mouth to Limburg was stabilized, particularly so that the course could be narrowed in shallow places. It was planned in the long run to make the Lahn navigable as far as Marburg and from there to construct a canal to Fulda to connect it with the Weser. This would create a waterway from France to North Sea via the states of the Confederation of the Rhine. Upstream of Limburg, however, the work was slow, partly because the population pressed into emergency service only reluctantly cooperated. Large parts of the shore were only secured with fascines, which rotted shortly thereafter.

In 1816 the Duchy of Nassau and the Kingdom of Prussia agreed to expand the Lahn as far as Giessen, where it joined the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Little is known about the work that followed, but in the 1825 boatmen on the Lahn who shipped mineral water from springs in Selters and Fachingen addressed a letter of appreciation to the Nassau government in Wiesbaden for the rehabilitation of river systems. Overall, however, there seems to have been only repairs and temporary works accomplished through the 1830s.

The earliest attempts to count ship traffic on the Lahn dated from 1827. At the lock at Runkel, 278 vessels were counted in that year, with the state government of Nassau explicitly pointing out that most of the river traffic travelled from the mouth to Limburg, or with smaller boats from the upper reaches to Weilburg, and only a small part passed Runkel. In 1833, however, 464 vessels were counted. The main reason for the increase is likely the increase in iron ore mining in the surroundings of Weilburg. An estimate from 1840 placed the quantity of iron ore transported on the entire river at approximately 2000 boat loads, though the river was only navigable from the mouth to Weilburg. In addition, mainly cereals and mineral water were transported downriver. Upriver, the boats carried primarily coal, charcoal, gypsum, and colonial goods. Around 1835, about 80 larger shallow-draft boats were in operation on the Lahn.

Given the increasing ore mining in the Lahn Valley, officials from Nassau and Prussia in 1841 made an inspection trip along the river from Marburg to the Rhine. The Prussians were the driving force behind river expansion projects, seeking to establish a connection between Wetzlar and their Rhine Province and to secure the iron ore supply for the growing industry in the Ruhr Valley. Until 1844, Hesse-Darmstadt also joined expansion efforts, while Hesse-Kassel declined participation. The participating governments agreed to make the Lahn passable as far as Gießen for boats that were significantly larger than the existing vehicles on the river. In Prussian territory, the work was largely completed by 1847, including construction of locks in Dorlar, Wetzlar, Wetzlar-Blechwalze, Oberbiel and Niederbiel. In Nassau&#x27;s territory, locks were built at Löhnberg, Villmar, and Balduinstein, as well as the greatest technical achievement: the Weilburg ship tunnel. The river bank reinforcement and channel deepening along Nassau&#x27;s section of the Lahn, however, was slow. Moreover, when the lock at Limburg fell short of the width contractually agreed upon, Nassau refused an extension. This led to several clashes between Nassau and Prussia in the following years until Nassau had finally fulfilled its obligations in 1855.

Despite the expansion, boats on the Lahn could travel fully loaded only from Gießen to Löhnberg. There, they had to lighten their load in order to reduce their draft and continue the journey. Also, this was only during two to three months. In a further four to five months per year, the load had to be reduced even earlier due to the low water level. The rest of the year the Lahn was not passable. From Wetzlar to Lahnstein, where the freight was unloaded onto the large barges of the Rhine, the boats took three to four days. A trip from Wetzlar to the mouth and then towed back with horses lasted for about 14 days in good conditions. At that time, there were mainly two types of transport boats in use: those with a capacity of 350 hundredweights and a larger variant with a capacity of 1300 hundredweights.

In 1857 to 1863, the Lahntal railway (&quot;Lahntalbahn&quot;) was built, with nine major bridges and 18 tunnels along the river. Afterward, Prussia and Nassau tried to keep shipping along the Lahn alive through the lowering of tariffs. Ultimately, however, rail gained acceptance as a means of transport and cargo shipping on the Lahn gradually declined. Several projects begun in 1854 to operate steamboats on the Lahn died in their infancy. In 1875, 1885 and 1897 the Prussian government discussed plans for the transformation of the Lahn into a canal, which would allow the passage for larger vessels, but these plans were never implemented. Only in places was the riverbed dredged, such as around 1880 near Runkel, from 1905 to 1907 from the mouth to Bad Ems, and from 1925 to 1928 from the mouth to Steeden.

In 1964, an expansion of the Lahn for 300-ton vessels was completed. In 1981, freight shipping on the Lahn came to an end. Today, the Lahn is used exclusively for recreational boats.

===Recent history===
In 1960, gravel mining began in the broad plains of the Lahn Valley in Marburg and Giessen. This ended in 1996 and large sections of Lahn Valley in Hesse were set aside as a nature reserve

On 7 February 1984, the Lahn experienced a 100-year flood, which caused millions of German Marks in damage. This has since led to a central flood warning system and coordination of flood control efforts through the regional council of Giessen.

== Boating ==
The Lahn, from a point between Lahnau and Dutenhofen (Wetzlar) to its confluence the Rhine, is designated as a federal waterway. In this area, it is subject to the Water and Shipping Administration of the federal government, with the responsible office being that at Koblenz.

The middle and lower section of the Lahn is navigable and has a large number of locks. The waterway is used almost exclusively by smaller motor yachts for tourists, as well as paddled- and rowboats. For non-motorized watercraft, the Lahn can be used for the entire length between Roth (of Weimar) and the Rhine.

From the mouth upwards to Dehrn (of Runkel), Lahn-km 70 (above Limburg), the river is consistently passable for larger vessels, with locks operated by personnel. The Water and Shipping Administration guarantees a minimum water depth of 1.60 m in the navigation channel. There are stream gauges at Kalkofen (of Dörnberg) (normal water level 1.80 m) and at Leun. Above Dehrn there are manual locks and frequent shoals, making the passage of boats difficult. Two weirs in Wetzlar are an obstruction to shipping further upriver.

== Economy and tourism ==

Since the late 1980s, there have been increasing attempts to promote the Lahn for ecotourism and to coordinate and expand the existing uses. There were first tourism associations at the state level, and these have now joined into the Lahntal Tourist Association.

The Lahntal bike path &#x27;Lahntalradweg&#x27; leads through the Lahn Valley, along the Lahn Holiday Road. It is accessible from the Upper Lahn Valley Railway between Feudingen and Marburg, the Main-Weser Railway between Marburg and Giessen, as well as the Lahntal railway between Giessen and Friedrichssegen. For walkers there is the Lahnhöhenwege along both sides of the Lahn from Wetzlar to Oberlahnstein. The first partial section of a pilgrimage route, the Lahn-Camino on the left side of the Lahn, leads from Wetzlar Cathedral to Lahnstein via Castle Lahneck and the Hospital Chapel.

There are 19 hydroelectric plants using the Lahn to generate electricity. Wine is produced in Obernhof and Weinähr. The wines of the Lahn region are marketed under the trade name Lahntal as Middle Rhine wines.

==Fauna and flora==
In 1999, the Lahn was classified as Biological Grade II and Chemical Grade I. Overall it is considered natural. The migrations of fish such as salmon are hindered by the river&#x27;s weirs and water levels, but attempts have been made through the installation of fish ladders to reintroduce formerly native fish. After the end of gravel mining in mid-1990s, the river between Lahnau, Heuchelheim, and Dutenhofen (of Wetzlar) in the middle Lahn Valley has developed into one of the largest nature reserves in Hesse, known as the Lahnau Nature Preserve.

== Tributaries ==
The two most important tributaries of the Lahn, and those with the largest catchment inflows, are the Ohm and the Dill. The Dill originates in the southwestern foothills of the Rothaargebirge (the &quot;Haincher Höhe&quot;) and enters the Lahn from the right. The Ohm flows from the Vogelsberg and enters from the left. It is notable that not only is the Ohm at the point of its confluence with the Lahn only one kilometre shorter from its source than the Lahn itself, but the Ohm&#x27;s catchment area of is significantly larger than that of the Lahn above the confluence, , or only before the inflow of the Wetschaft only 2 kilometres upstream.

Between the Lahn&#x27;s source area in the Rothaargebirge and Gießen, all of the left tributaries are from the less mountainous parts of the West Hessian Bergland. After the turn towards the west or southwest near Gießen, all the left tributaries flow from the Hochtaunus. The right tributaries between the source area and the confluence of the Dill near Wetzlar come from the Gladenbach Bergland, while downstream they originate in the (High) Westerwald. Much of the Westerwald, in contrast, has no significant watershed, so the streams are almost random in finding their direction.

Because the highest point of the Westerwald is near the Sieg, and especially because the Taunus is very close to the Main, both Mittelgebirge are each considerably more than half drained by the Lahn. Especially the left tributaries from the Taunus flow with a strong south-north orientation. The river Emsbach runs through the Idstein Basin, which divides the (Hinter-) Taunus into two parts, while the Aar is central for the (Western and Eastern) Aartaunus.

<text>The Thames Embankment is a work of 19th-century civil engineering that reclaimed marshy land next to the River Thames in central London. It consists of the Victoria Embankment and Chelsea Embankment.

==History==
There had been a long history of failed proposals to embank the Thames in central London. Embankments along the Thames were first proposed by Christopher Wren in the 1660s, then in 1824 former soldier and aide to George IV, Sir Frederick Trench suggested an embankment known as &#x27;Trench&#x27;s Terrace&#x27; from Blackfriars to Charing Cross. Trench brought a bill to Parliament which was blocked by river interests.

In the 1830s, the painter John Martin promoted a version, as realised later, to contain an intercepting sewer. In January 1842 the City Corporation backed a plan designed by James Walker but which was dropped due to government infighting. The government itself built the Chelsea Embankment in 1854 from Chelsea Hospital to Millbank.
Started in 1862, the Victoria Embankment starting from Millbank on the main, north (or &quot;left&quot; bank) was primarily designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette with architectural work on the embankment wall and river stairs by Charles Henry Driver. It incorporates the main low level interceptor sewer from the then limits of west London&#x27;s growth, and an underground railway over which a wide road and riverside walkway were built and run today, shored up by the sturdy retaining wall along the tidal River Thames (the Tideway). In total, Bazalgette&#x27;s scheme reclaimed of land from the river. It prevented flooding, such as around what had been the remnants of Thorney Island, much of which was owned by the Duke of Westminster. Those waterfront hotels, supply warehouses and genteel &quot;town houses&quot; which had boat access by inlets and watergates lost this.
Much of the granite used in the projects was brought from Lamorna Cove in Cornwall. The quarried stone was shaped into blocks on site before being loaded on to barges and transported up the English Channel into the Thames.

From Battersea Bridge in the west, it includes Cheyne Walk, Chelsea Embankment, Grosvenor Road, Millbank and Victoria Tower Gardens.

Beyond the Houses of Parliament, it is named Victoria Embankment as it stretches to Blackfriars Bridge; this stretch incorporates part of the shared District/Circle Line bi-directional tunnel of the London Underground and passes Shell Mex House and the Savoy Hotel. It likewise incorporates gardens and open space, here at their greatest, and collectively known as the &quot;Embankment Gardens&quot;, which provide a peaceful oasis in the heart of Central London. The gardens include many statues, including a memorial with a bust of Bazalgette.

The smaller and shorter Albert Embankment is on the south side of the river, opposite the Millbank section of the Thames Embankment. It was created by Bazalgette for the Metropolitan Board of Works and built by William Webster between July 1866 and November 1869.

Some parts of the Embankment were rebuilt in the 20th century due to wartime bomb damage or natural disasters such as the 1928 Thames flood.

The Thames and Albert embankments are but a fraction of the 200 miles of walls that prevent the Thames from flooding adjoining lands, and which were begun in the Middle Ages.

<doc id="390970" wikidata="Q575922" url="?curid=390970" title="Mars Polar Lander">
<text>The Mars Polar Lander, also known as the Mars Surveyor &#x27;98 Lander, was a 290-kilogram uncrewed spacecraft lander launched by NASA on January 3, 1999, to study the soil and climate of Planum Australe, a region near the south pole on Mars. It formed part of the Mars Surveyor &#x27;98 mission. On December 3, 1999, however, after the descent phase was expected to be complete, the lander failed to reestablish communication with Earth. A post-mortem analysis determined the most likely cause of the mishap was premature termination of the engine firing prior to the lander touching the surface, causing it to strike the planet at a high velocity.

The total cost of the Mars Polar Lander was US$165 million. Spacecraft development cost US$110 million, launch was estimated at US$45 million, and mission operations at US$10 million.

== Mission background ==
=== History ===
As part of the Mars Surveyor &#x27;98 mission, a lander was sought as a way to gather climate data from the ground in conjunction with an orbiter. NASA suspected that a large quantity of frozen water may exist under a thin layer of dust at the south pole. In planning the Mars Polar Lander, the potential water content in the Martian south pole was the strongest determining factor for choosing a landing location. A CD-ROM containing the names of one million children from around the world was placed on board the spacecraft as part of the &quot;Send Your Name to Mars&quot; program designed to encourage interest in the space program among children. 

The primary objectives of the mission were to:
* land on the layered terrain in the south polar region of Mars;
* search for evidence related to ancient climates and more recent periodic climate change;
* give a picture of the current climate and seasonal change at high latitudes and, in particular, the exchange of water vapor between the atmosphere and ground;
* search for near-surface ground ice in the polar regions, and analyze the soil for physically and chemically bound carbon dioxide and water; and
* study surface morphology (forms and structures), geology, topography, and weather of the landing site.

=== Deep Space 2 probes ===

The Mars Polar Lander carried two small, identical impactor probes known as &quot;Deep Space 2 A and B&quot;. The probes were intended to strike the surface with a high velocity at approximately to penetrate the Martian soil and study the subsurface composition up to a meter in depth. However, after entering the Martian atmosphere, attempts to contact the probes failed.

Deep Space 2 was funded by the New Millennium Program, and their development costs was US$28 million.

=== Spacecraft design ===
The spacecraft measured 3.6 meters wide and 1.06 meters tall with the legs and solar arrays fully deployed. The base was primarily constructed with an aluminum honeycomb deck, composite graphite-epoxy sheets forming the edge, and three aluminum legs. During landing, the legs were to deploy from stowed position with compression springs and absorb the force of the landing with crushable aluminum honeycomb inserts in each leg. On the deck of the lander, a small thermal Faraday cage enclosure housed the computer, power distribution electronics and batteries, telecommunication electronics, and the capillary pump loop heat pipe (LHP) components, which maintained operable temperature. Each of these components included redundant units in the event that one may fail.

==== Attitude control and propulsion ====
While traveling to Mars, the cruise stage was three-axis stabilized with four hydrazine monopropellant reaction engine modules, each including a 22-newton trajectory correction maneuver thruster for propulsion and a 4-newton reaction control system thruster for attitude control (orientation). Orientation of the spacecraft was performed using redundant Sun sensors, star trackers, and inertial measurement units.

During descent, the lander used three clusters of pulse-modulated engines, each containing four 266-newton hydrazine monopropellant thrusters. Altitude during landing was measured by a Doppler radar system, and an attitude and articulation control subsystem (AACS) controlled the attitude to ensure the spacecraft landed at the optimal azimuth to maximize solar collection and telecommunication with the lander.

The lander was launched with two hydrazine tanks containing 64 kilograms of propellant and pressurized with helium. Each spherical tank was located at the underside of the lander and provided propellant during the cruise and descent stages.

==== Communications ====
During the cruise stage, communications with the spacecraft were conducted over the X band using a medium-gain, horn-shaped antenna and redundant solid state power amplifiers. For contingency measures, a low-gain omnidirectional antenna was also included.

The lander was originally intended to communicate data through the failed Mars Climate Orbiter via the UHF antenna. With the orbiter lost on September 23, 1999, the lander would still be able to communicate directly to the NASA Deep Space Network through the Direct-To-Earth (DTE) link, an X band, steerable, medium-gain, parabolic antenna located on the deck. Alternatively, Mars Global Surveyor could be used as a relay using the UHF antenna at multiple times each Martian day. However the Deep Space Network could only receive data from, and not send commands to, the lander using this method. The direct-to-Earth medium-gain antenna provided a 12.6-kbit/s return channel, and the UHF relay path provided a 128-kbit/s return channel. Communications with the spacecraft would be limited to one-hour events, constrained by heat-buildup that would occur in the amplifiers. The number of communication events would also be constrained by power limitations.

==== Power ====
The cruise stage included two gallium arsenide solar arrays to power the radio system and maintain power to the batteries in the lander, which kept certain electronics warm.

After descending to the surface, the lander was to deploy two 3.6-meter-wide gallium arsenide solar arrays, located on either side of the spacecraft. Another two auxiliary solar arrays were located on the side to provide additional power for a total of an expected 200 watts and approximately eight to nine hours of operating time per day.

While the Sun would not have set below the horizon during the primary mission, too little light would have reached the solar arrays to remain warm enough for certain electronics to continue functioning. To avoid this problem, a 16-ampere-hour nickel–hydrogen battery was included to be recharged during the day and to power the heater for the thermal enclosure at night. This solution also was expected to limit the life of the lander. As the Martian days would grow colder in late summer, too little power would be supplied to the heater to avoid freezing, resulting in the battery also freezing and signaling the end of the operating life for the lander.
==== Scientific instruments ====


; Mars Descent Imager (MARDI): Mounted to the bottom of the lander, the camera was intended to capture 30 images as the spacecraft descended to the surface. The images acquired would be used to provide geographic and geologic context to the landing area.
; Surface Stereo Imager (SSI): Using a pair of charge-coupled devices (CCDs), the stereo panoramic camera was mounted to a one-meter-tall mast and would aid in the thermal evolved gas analyzer in determining areas of interest for the robotic arm. In addition, the camera would be used to estimate the column density of atmospheric dust, the optical depth of aerosols, and slant column abundances of water vapor using narrow-band imaging of the Sun.
; Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR): The laser sounding instrument was intended to detect and characterize aerosols in the atmosphere up to three kilometers above the lander. The instrument operated in two modes: &quot;active mode&quot;, using an included laser diode, and &quot;acoustic&quot; mode, using the Sun as the light source for the sensor. In active mode, the laser sounder was to emit 100-nanosecond pulses at a wavelength of 0.88-micrometer into the atmosphere, and then record the duration of time to detect the light scattered by aerosols. The duration of time required for the light to return could then be used to determine the abundance of ice, dust and other aerosols in the region. In acoustic mode, the instrument measures the brightness of the sky as lit by the Sun and records the scattering of light as it passes to the sensor.
; Robotic Arm (RA): Located on the front of the lander, the robotic arm was a meter-long aluminum tube with an elbow joint and an articulated scoop attached to the end. The scoop was intended to be used to dig into the soil in the direct vicinity of the lander. The soil could then be analyzed in the scoop with the robotic arm camera or transferred into the thermal evolved gas analyzer.
; Robotic Arm Camera (RAC): Located on the robotic arm, the charge coupled camera included two red, two green, and four blue lamps to illuminate soil samples for analysis.
; Meteorological Package (MET): Several instruments related to sensing and recording weather patterns, were included in the package. Wind, temperature, pressure, and humidity sensors were located on the robotic arm and two deployable masts: a 1.2-meter &quot;main mast&quot;, located on top of the lander, and a 0.9-meter secondary &quot;submast&quot; that would deploy downward to acquire measurements close to the ground.
; Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA): The instrument was intended to measure abundances of water, water ice, adsorbed carbon dioxide, oxygen, and volatile-bearing minerals in surface and subsurface soil samples collected and transferred by the robotic arm. Materials placed onto a grate inside one of the eight ovens, would be heated and vaporized at 1,000 °C. The evolved gas analyzer would then record measurements using a spectrometer and an electrochemical cell. For calibration, an empty oven would also be heated during this process for differential scanning calorimetry. The difference in the energy required to heat each oven would then indicate concentrations of water ice and other minerals containing water or carbon dioxide.
; Mars Microphone: The microphone was intended to be the first instrument to record sounds on another planet. Primarily composed of a microphone generally used with hearing aids, the instrument was expected to record sounds of blowing dust, electrical discharges and the sounds of the operating spacecraft in either 2.6-second or 10.6-second, 12-bit samples. The microphone was built using off-the-shelf parts including a Sensory, Inc. RSC-164 integrated circuit typically used in speech-recognition devices.

== Mission profile ==
=== Launch and trajectory ===
&quot;Mars Polar Lander&quot; was launched on January 3, 1999, at 20:21:10 UTC by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from Space Launch Complex 17B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, aboard a Delta II 7425–9.5 launch vehicle. The complete burn sequence lasted for 47.7 minutes after a Thiokol Star 48B solid-fuel third stage booster placed the spacecraft into an 11-month, Mars transfer trajectory at a final velocity of 6.884 kilometers per second with respect to Mars. During cruise, the spacecraft was stowed inside an aeroshell capsule and a segment known as the &quot;cruise stage&quot; provided power and communications with Earth.


=== Landing zone ===
The target landing zone was a region near the south pole of Mars, called &quot;Ultimi Scopuli&quot;, because it featured a large number of scopuli ( or irregular scarps).

=== Landing attempt ===
On December 3, 1999, &quot;Mars Polar Lander&quot; arrived at Mars and mission operators began preparations for landing. At 14:39:00 UTC, the cruise stage was jettisoned, which began a planned communication dropout to last until the spacecraft had touched down on the surface. Six minutes prior to atmospheric entry, a programmed 80-second thruster firing turned the spacecraft to the proper entry orientation, with the heat shield positioned to absorb the 1,650 °C heat that would be generated as the descent capsule passed through the atmosphere.

Traveling at 6.9 kilometers per second, the entry capsule entered the Martian atmosphere at 20:10:00 UTC, and was expected to land in the vicinity of in a region known as Planum Australe. Reestablishment of communication was anticipated for 20:39:00 UTC, after landing. However communication was not reestablished, and the lander was declared lost.

On May 25, 2008, the Phoenix lander arrived at Mars, and has subsequently completed most of the objectives of the &quot;Mars Polar Lander&quot;, carrying several of the same or derivative instruments.

=== Intended operations ===
Traveling at approximately 6.9 kilometers/second and 125 kilometers above the surface, the spacecraft entered the atmosphere and was initially decelerated by using a 2.4 meter ablation heat shield, located on the bottom of the entry body, to aerobrake through 116 kilometers of the atmosphere. Three minutes after entry, the spacecraft had slowed to 496 meters per second, signaling an 8.4-meter polyester parachute to deploy from a mortar, followed immediately by heat shield separation and MARDI powering on while 8.8 kilometers above the surface. The parachute further slowed the speed of the spacecraft to 85 meters per second when the ground radar began tracking surface features to detect the best possible landing location and determine the vertical speed via the Doppler effect for thrust control.

When the spacecraft had slowed to 80 meters per second, one minute after parachute deployment, the lander separated from the backshell and began a powered descent at 1.3 kilometers aloft. Vertical speed was intended to drop to 2.4 meters per second at 12 m height and then be constant until touchdown. Below 40 meters, the radar would become unreliable by raised dust and was switched off already at that height; for the final seconds, the thrust would be controlled by inertial sensors. A function to switch off the thrust immediately at touchdown was also armed at 40 meters. Touchdown was expected at 20:01 UTC, given as 20:15 ″Earth-received time″.

Lander operations were to begin five minutes after touchdown, first unfolding the stowed solar arrays, followed by orienting the medium-gain, direct-to-Earth antenna to allow for the first communication with the NASA Deep Space Network. A 45-minute transmission was to be broadcast to Earth containing 30 landing images acquired by MARDI. Arrival of that signal of a successful landing was expected at 20:39 UTC. The lander would then power down for six hours to allow the batteries to charge. On the following days, the spacecraft instruments would be checked by operators and science experiments were to begin on December 7 and last for at least the following 90 Martian Sols, with the possibility of an extended mission.

== Loss of communications ==
On December 3, 1999, at 14:39:00 UTC, the last telemetry from &quot;Mars Polar Lander&quot; was sent, just prior to cruise stage separation and the subsequent atmospheric entry. No further signals were received from the spacecraft. Attempts were made by the Mars Global Surveyor to photograph the area in which the lander was believed to be. An object was visible and believed to be the lander. However, subsequent imaging in September 2005 resulted in the identified object being ruled out. &quot;Mars Polar Lander&quot; remains lost.

The cause of the communication loss is not known. However, the Failure Review Board concluded that the most likely cause of the mishap was a software error that incorrectly identified vibrations, caused by the deployment of the stowed legs, as surface touchdown. The resulting action by the spacecraft was the shutdown of the descent engines, while still likely 40 meters above the surface. Although it was known that leg deployment could create the false indication, the software&#x27;s design instructions did not account for that eventuality.

In addition to the premature shutdown of the descent engines, the Failure Review Board also assessed other potential modes of failure. Lacking substantial evidence for the mode of failure, the following possibilities could not be excluded:

* surface conditions exceed landing design capabilities;
* loss of control due to dynamic effects;
* landing site not survivable;
* backshell/parachute contacts lander;
* loss of control due to center-of-mass offset; or
* heatshield fails due to micrometeoroid impact.

The failure of the Mars Polar Lander took place two and a half months after the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter. Inadequate funding and poor management have been cited as underlying causes of the failures. According to Thomas Young, chairman of the Mars Program Independent Assessment Team, the program &quot;was under funded by at least 30%.&quot;

Planum Australe, which served as the exploration target for the lander and the two Deep Space 2 probes, would in later years be explored by European Space Agency&#x27;s MARSIS radar, which examined and analyzed the site from Mars&#x27; orbit.

<doc id="390971" wikidata="Q394670" url="?curid=390971" title="Agnes de Mille">
<text>Agnes George de Mille (September 18, 1905 – October 7, 1993) was an American dancer and choreographer.

== Early years ==
Agnes de Mille was born in New York City into a well-connected family of theater professionals. Her father William C. deMille and her uncle Cecil B. DeMille were both Hollywood directors. Her mother, Anna Angela George, was the daughter of Henry George, the economist. On her father&#x27;s side, Agnes was the granddaughter of playwrights Henry Churchill de Mille and Matilda Beatrice deMille. Her paternal grandmother was of German-Jewish descent.

She had a love for acting and originally wanted to be an actress, but was told that she was &quot;not pretty enough&quot;, so she turned her attention to dance. As a child, she had longed to dance, but dance at this time was considered more of an activity, rather than a viable career option, so her parents refused to allow her to dance. She did not seriously consider dancing as a career until after she graduated from college. When de Mille&#x27;s younger sister was prescribed ballet classes to cure her flat feet, de Mille joined her. De Mille lacked flexibility and technique, though, and did not have a dancer&#x27;s body. Classical ballet was the most widely known dance form at this time, and de Mille&#x27;s apparent lack of ability limited her opportunities. She taught herself from watching film stars on the set with her father in Hollywood; these were more interesting for her to watch than perfectly turned out legs, and she developed strong character work and compelling performances. One of de Mille&#x27;s early jobs, thanks to her father&#x27;s connections, was choreographing Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s film &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1934). DeMille&#x27;s dance director LeRoy Prinz clashed with the younger de Mille. Her uncle always deferred to Prinz, even after agreeing to his niece&#x27;s dances in advance, and Agnes de Mille left the film.

De Mille graduated from UCLA with a degree in English where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, and in 1933 moved to London to study with Dame Marie Rambert, eventually joining Rambert&#x27;s company, The Ballet Club, later Ballet Rambert, and Antony Tudor&#x27;s London Ballet.

== Career ==
De Mille arrived in New York in 1938 and later began her association with the American Ballet Theatre (then called the Ballet Theatre) in 1939. One of de Mille&#x27;s first pieces was &quot;Black Ritual&quot; (&quot;Obeah&quot;), which she began choreographing for the newly formed Ballet Theatre&#x27;s first season. Lasting 25 minutes, this performance was created for the &quot;Negro Unit&quot; of the dance company and was performed by 16 black ballerinas. This was the first representation of black dancers in a New York ballet performance within the context of a dominantly white company. Therefore, although it was only performed three times before being disbanded, &quot;Black Ritual&quot; was an unprecedented performance, changing perceptions about black ballet dancers and marking a significant milestone in American ballet history.

De Mille&#x27;s first recognized significant work was &quot;Rodeo&quot; (1942), whose score was by Aaron Copland, and which she staged for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Although de Mille continued to choreograph nearly up to the time of her death—her final ballet, &quot;The Other&quot;, was completed in 1992—most of her later works have dropped out of the ballet repertoire. Besides &quot;Rodeo&quot;, two other de Mille ballets are performed regularly, &quot;Three Virgins and a Devil&quot; (1934) adapted from a tale by Giovanni Boccaccio, and &quot;Fall River Legend&quot; (1948) based on the life of Lizzie Borden.

While she lived in New York and was working for Ballet Theatre in 1941, de Mille choreographed &quot;Drums Sound in Hackensack&quot; for the Jooss Ballet (originally located in Germany), which had just moved to New York in 1939. This was an important step in the company&#x27;s history as it was the first performance not choreographed by Kurt Jooss himself. Although there are no film recordings of the performance, de Mille&#x27;s choreography notes and personal reflections of the dancers shed light on the characteristics of the performance. The piece was placed in a historical context with an American theme and fit the traditional mold for de Mille&#x27;s pieces featuring a female perspective. As one of the first pieces de Mille choreographed for a group of dancers rather than simply one or two people, the performance was significant in her career as a choreographer.

After her success with &quot;Rodeo&quot; de Mille was hired to choreograph the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1943). The dream ballet, in which dancers Marc Platt, Katherine Sergava, and George Church doubled for the leading actors, successfully integrated dance into the musical&#x27;s plot. Instead of functioning as an interlude or &quot;divertissement&quot;, the ballet provided key insights into the heroine&#x27;s emotional troubles. This performance exemplifies how de Mille brought new ideas to the performing arts, integrating dance to enhance the musical. This production is widely known for this innovative idea and is credited for starting de Mille&#x27;s fame as a choreographer, both for Broadway and in the dance industry. De Mille went on to choreograph over a dozen other musicals, most notably &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot; (1944), which presented her feelings of loneliness as a woman who saw her husband leave to serve for the army, &quot;Carousel&quot; (1945), &quot;Allegro&quot; (1947, director as well as choreographer), &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1947, for which she was co-recipient of the inaugural Tony Award for Best Choreography), &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1949), &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot; (1951), &quot;The Girl in Pink Tights&quot; (1954), &quot;Goldilocks&quot; (1957), and &quot;110 in the Shade&quot; (1963). These many dance performances within musical theater enriched Broadway musicals by how they provided perspective on the events of the time.

De Mille&#x27;s success on Broadway did not translate into success in film. Her only significant film credit is &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955). She was not invited to recreate her choreography for either &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954) or &quot;Carousel&quot; (1956). Nevertheless, her two specials for the &quot; Omnibus&quot; TV series titled &quot;The Art of Ballet&quot; and &quot;The Art of Choreography&quot; (both televised in 1956) were immediately recognized as landmark attempts to bring serious dance to the attention of a broad public.

During his presidency, John F. Kennedy appointed de Mille a member of the National Advisory Committee on the Arts, the predecessor to the National Endowment for the Arts, to which she was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson after its creation.

Her love for acting played a very important role in her choreography. De Mille revolutionized musical theatre by creating choreography that not only conveyed the emotional dimensions of the characters but enhanced the plot. Her choreography, as a reflection of her awareness of acting, reflected the angst and turmoil of the characters instead of simply focusing on a dancer&#x27;s physical technique.

De Mille regularly worked with a recognizable core group of dancers, including Virginia Bosler (Doris), Gemze de Lappe, Lidija Franklin, Jean Houloose, Dania Krupska, Bambi Linn, Joan McCracken, James Mitchell, Mavis Ray, and, at American Ballet Theatre, Sallie Wilson. Krupska, Mitchell, and Ray served as de Mille&#x27;s assistant choreographers, and de Lappe took an active role in preserving de Mille&#x27;s work.
In 1973, de Mille founded the Agnes de Mille Dance Theatre, which she later revived as Heritage Dance Theatre.

De Mille developed a love for public speaking, becoming an outspoken advocate for dance in America. She spoke in front of Congress three times: once in the Senate, once in the House of Representatives, and once for the Committee for Medical Research.

She was interviewed in the television documentary series &quot;Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film&quot; (1980) primarily discussing the work of her uncle Cecil B. DeMille.

Agnes de Mille appears in a wheelchair in Frederick Wiseman&#x27;s 1995 film Ballet rehearsing her final piece, &quot;The Other.&quot; She tells her star &quot;You must look like something that&#x27;s absolutely broken, and stuck up in the wind.&quot;

== Writings ==
DeMille&#x27;s 1951 memoir &quot;Dance to the Piper&quot; was translated into five languages. It was reissued in 2015 by &quot;New York Review Books&quot;.

De Mille was a lifelong friend of modern dance legend Martha Graham. De Mille, in 1992, published &quot;Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham&quot;, a biography of Graham that de Mille worked on for more than 30 years.

After suffering from a near-fatal stroke, she wrote five books: &quot;Reprieve&quot; (which outlined the experience), &quot;Who Was Henry George?&quot;, &quot;Where the Wings Grow&quot;, &quot;America Dances&quot;, &quot;Portrait Gallery&quot;, and &quot;Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham&quot;. She also wrote &quot;And Promenade Home&quot;, &quot;To a Young Dancer&quot;, &quot;The Book of Dance&quot;, &quot;Lizzie Borden: Dance of Death&quot;, &quot;Dance in America&quot;, &quot;Russian Journals&quot;, and &quot;Speak to Me, Dance with Me&quot;.

De Mille also wrote an introduction entitled &quot;Anna George de Mille - A Note About the Author&quot; to the book &quot;Henry George: Citizen of the World&quot; by Anna George de Mille (daughter of Henry George &amp; Agnes&#x27; mother) which was published in 1950 by the University of North Carolina Press.

== Personal life ==
De Mille married Walter Prude on June 14, 1943. They had one child, Jonathan, born in 1946.

Agnes de Mille donated her papers to the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College &quot;between 1959 and 1968, and her &quot;Dance To The Piper&quot; was purchased in 1994. Three films were donated by Lester Tome in 2010. The bulk of the papers date from 1914 to 1960 and focus on both personal and professional aspects of de Mille&#x27;s life.&quot;

She suffered a stroke on stage in 1975, but recovered. She died in 1993 of a second stroke in her Greenwich Village apartment.

== Legacy ==
De Mille was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. De Mille&#x27;s many other awards include the Tony Award for Best Choreography (1947, for &quot;Brigadoon&quot;; 1962, for &quot;Kwamina&quot;), the Handel Medallion for achievement in the arts (1976), an honor from the Kennedy Center (1980), an Emmy for her work in &quot;The Indomitable de Mille&quot; (1980), Drama Desk Special Award (1986) and, in 1986, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts. De Mille also received seven honorary degrees from various colleges and universities. She was featured on a U.S. postage stamp in 2004.

At present, the only commercially available examples of de Mille&#x27;s choreography are parts one and two of &quot;Rodeo&quot; by the American Ballet Theatre, &quot;Fall River Legend&quot; (filmed in 1989 by the Dance Theatre of Harlem) and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;

<doc id="390975" wikidata="Q740718" url="?curid=390975" title="National Party (South Africa)">
<text>The National Party (, NP), also known as the Nationalist Party, was a political party in South Africa from 1914 to 1997, which was responsible for the implementation of apartheid rule. The party was an Afrikaner ethnic nationalist party, which initially promoted the interests of Afrikaners but later became a stalwart promoter and enactor of white supremacy, for which it is best known. It first became the governing party of the country in 1924. It merged with its rival, the South African Party (SAP), during the 1929-1939 Great Depression, and a splinter faction, the Re-United National Party became the official opposition during World War II and won power in 1948. With the National Party governing South Africa from 4 June 1948 until 9 May 1994, the country for the bulk of this time was only a &quot;de jure&quot; or partial democracy, as from 1958 onwards non-white people were barred from voting. In 1990, it began to style itself as simply a South African civic nationalist party, and after the fall of apartheid in 1994, attempted to become a moderate conservative one. The party&#x27;s reputation was damaged irreparably by perpetrating apartheid, and it rebranded itself as the New National Party in 1997 before eventually dissolving in 2005.

Following the 1948 general election, the party as the governing party of South Africa began implementing its policy of racial segregation, known as apartheid (the Afrikaans term for &quot;separateness&quot;). Although White-minority rule and racial segregation were already in existence in South Africa with non-Whites not having voting rights and efforts made to encourage segregation, apartheid intensified the segregation with stern penalties for non-Whites entering into areas designated for Whites-only without having a pass to permit them to do so (known as the pass laws), interracial marriage and sexual relationships were illegal and punishable offences. Black people faced significant restrictions on property rights. After South Africa was condemned by the British Commonwealth for its policies of apartheid, the NP-led government had South Africa leave the Commonwealth, abandon its monarchy led by the British monarch and become an independent republic. The party&#x27;s system of apartheid was officially labelled a crime against humanity by the United Nations General Assembly on 16 December 1966.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the NP-led white apartheid government faced internal unrest in South Africa and international pressure for the discrimination of non-Whites in South Africa. It resulted in policies of granting concessions to the non-White population while still retaining the apartheid system, such as the creation of Bantustans that were autonomous self-governing Black homelands (criticised for several of them being broken up into unconnected pieces and that they were still dominated by the White minority South African government), removing legal prohibitions on interracial marriage, and legalising certain non-White and multiracial political parties (excluding the very popular African National Congress (ANC), which the government still viewed as a terrorist organisation). Those identified as Coloureds and Indian South Africans were granted separate legislatures in 1983 alongside the central legislature that represented Whites to provide them self-government while maintaining apartheid, but no such congress was supplied to the Black population as their self-government was to be provided through the Bantustans. The NP-led government began changing laws affected by the apartheid system that had come under heavy domestic and international condemnation, such as removing the pass laws, granting Blacks full property rights that ended previous significant restrictions on Black land ownership, and the right to form trade unions. Following escalating economic sanctions over apartheid, negotiations between the NP-led government led by P. W. Botha and the outlawed ANC led by then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela began in 1987 with Botha seeking to accommodate the ANC&#x27;s demands and consider releasing Mandela and legalising the ANC on the condition that it would renounce the use of political violence to attain its aims.

F. W. de Klerk declared in February 1990 the decision to permit the release of Mandela from prison and ending South Africa&#x27;s ban on the ANC and other anti-apartheid movements. In September 1990 the party opened up its membership to all racial groups and rebranded itself as no longer being an ethnic nationalist party only representing Afrikaners, but would henceforth be a civic nationalist and conservative party representing all South Africans. However, there was significant opposition among hardliner supporters of apartheid that resulted in De Klerk&#x27;s government responding to them by holding a national referendum on Apartheid in 1992 for the White population alone that asked them if they supported the government&#x27;s policy to end apartheid and establish elections open to all South Africans: a large majority voted in favour of the government&#x27;s policy. In the 1994 elections, it expanded its base to include many non-Whites, including significant support from Coloured and Indian South Africans. It participated in the Government of National Unity between 1994 and 1996. In an attempt to distance itself from its past, the party was renamed the New National Party in 1997. The attempt was largely unsuccessful and the new party decided to merge with the ANC.

==Founding and early history==
The National Party was founded in Bloemfontein in 1914 by Afrikaner nationalists soon after the establishment of the Union of South Africa. Its founding was rooted in disagreements among South African Party politicians, particularly Prime Minister Louis Botha and his first Minister of Justice, J. B. M. Hertzog. After Hertzog began speaking out publicly against the Botha government&#x27;s &quot;one-stream&quot; policy in 1912, Botha removed him from the cabinet. Hertzog and his followers in the Orange Free State province subsequently moved to establish the National Party to oppose the government by advocating a &quot;two-stream&quot; policy of equal rights for the English and Afrikaner communities. Afrikaner nationalists in the Transvaal and Cape provinces soon followed suit, so that three distinct provincial NP organisations were in existence in time for the 1915 general elections.

The NP first came to power in coalition with the Labour Party in 1924, with Hertzog as Prime Minister. In 1930 the Hertzog government worked to undermine the vote of Coloureds (South Africans of mixed White and non-White ancestry) by granting the right to vote to White women, thus doubling White political power. In 1934, Hertzog agreed to merge his National Party with the rival South African Party of Jan Smuts to form the United Party. A hardline faction of Afrikaner nationalists led by Daniel François Malan refused to accept the merger and maintained a rump National Party called the &#x27;Purified National Party&#x27;. The Purified National Party used opposition to South African participation in World War II to stir up anti-British feelings amongst Afrikaners. This led to a reunification of the Purified Nationalists with the faction that had merged with the South African Party; together, they formed the Re-United National Party, which went on to defeat Smuts&#x27; United Party in 1948 in a coalition with the much smaller Afrikaner Party. In 1951, the two amalgamated to once again become known simply as the National Party.

==Apartheid program==
Upon taking power after the 1948 general election, the NP began to implement a program of apartheid – the legal system of political, economic and social separation of the races intended to maintain and extend political and economic control of South Africa by the White minority. The party&#x27;s actions made South Africa for the most part a pariah state across the world. Apartheid was officially labelled a crime against humanity by the United Nations General Assembly on 16 December 1966.

In 1959 the Bantu Self-Government Act established so-called Homelands (sometimes pejoratively called Bantustans) for ten different Black tribes. The ultimate goal of the NP was to move all Black South Africans into one of these homelands (although they might continue to work in South Africa as &quot;guest workers&quot;), leaving what was left of South Africa (about 87 per cent of the land area) with what would then be a White majority, at least on paper. As the apartheid government saw the homelands as embryonic independent nations, all Black South Africans were registered as citizens of the homelands, not of the nation as a whole, and were expected to exercise their political rights only in the homelands. Accordingly, the three token parliamentary seats reserved for White representatives of Black South Africans in the Cape Province were scrapped. The other three provinces – Transvaal Province, the Orange Free State Province, and Natal Province had never allowed any Black representation.

Coloureds were removed from the Common Roll of Cape Province in 1953. Instead of voting for the same representatives as White South Africans, they could now vote only for four White representatives to speak for them. Later, in 1968, the Coloureds were disenfranchised altogether. In the place of the four parliamentary seats, a partially elected body was set up to advise the government in an amendment to the Separate Representation of Voters Act. This made the electorate entirely White, as Indian South Africans had never had any representation.

In a move unrecognised by the rest of the world, the former German colony of South West Africa (now Namibia), which South Africa had occupied in World War I, was effectively incorporated into South Africa as a League of Nations mandate, with seven members elected to represent its White citizens in the Parliament of South Africa. The White minority of South West Africa, predominantly Germans and Afrikaners, considered its interests akin to those of the Afrikaners in South Africa and therefore supported the National Party in subsequent elections.

These reforms bolstered the NP politically, as they removed Black and Coloured influence – which was hostile to the NP – from the electoral process and incorporated the pro-nationalist Whites of South-West Africa. The NP increased its parliamentary majority in almost every election between 1948 and 1977.

Numerous segregation laws had been passed before the NP took power in 1948. Among the most significant were the &#x27;Natives Land Act, No 27 of 1913&#x27;, and the &#x27;Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923&#x27;. The former made it illegal for Blacks to purchase or lease land from Whites except in reserves, which restricted Black occupancy to less than eight percent of South Africa&#x27;s land. The latter laid the foundations for residential segregation in urban areas. Apartheid laws passed by the NP after 1948 included the &#x27;Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act&#x27;, the &#x27;Immorality Act&#x27;, the &#x27;Population Registration Act&#x27;, and the &#x27;Group Areas Act&#x27;, which prohibited non-white males from being in certain areas of the country (especially at night) unless they were employed there.

==From Dominion to republic==

The NP strongly advocated republicanism, a sentiment rooted in Boer history. Beginning in 1836, waves of Boers began to migrate north from the Cape Colony to live beyond the reach of the British colonial administration. Eventually, the migrating Boers founded three republics in southern Africa: the Natalia Republic, the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. British colonial expansion in the 19th century led to the annexation of the Natalia Republic by Britain and the First and Second Boer Wars, which resulted in the South African Republic and the Orange Free State being annexed into the Empire as well.

Despite Britain&#x27;s victory in the Second Boer War, Afrikaners resisted British control in southern Africa. In 1914, a group of anti-British Afrikaners led the Maritz rebellion against the Union of South Africa during World War I; two years later, an NP congress called for South Africa to become a republic before changing its mind and deciding that it was too early. The &quot;Afrikaner Broederbond&quot;, a secret organization founded in 1918 to support the interests of Afrikaners in South Africa, soon became a powerful force in the South African political scene. The Republican Bond was established in the 1930s, and other republican organisations such as the Purified National Party, the Voortrekkers, Noodhulpliga (First-Aid League) and the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurverenigings (Federation of Afrikaans Cultural Organisations) also came into being. There was a widespread outpouring of nationalist sentiment around the 1938 centenary of the Great Trek and the Battle of Blood River. It was seen to signify the perpetuation of white South African culture, and anti-British and pro-republican feelings grew more assertive.

It was obvious in political circles that the Union of South Africa was headed inevitably towards republicanism. Although it remained a Dominion after unification in 1910, the country was granted increased amounts of self-government; indeed, it already had complete autonomy on specific issues. It was agreed in 1910 that the South African government would look after domestic matters but that the country&#x27;s external affairs would remain British-controlled.

Hertzog&#x27;s trip to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference was a definite (if failed) attempt to gain independence. In 1926, however, the Balfour Declaration was passed, affording every British dominion within the British Empire equal rank and bestowing upon them their right of the direction of foreign issues. This resulted the following year in the institution of South Africa&#x27;s first-ever Department of Foreign Affairs. 1931 saw a backtrack as the Statute of Westminster resolved that British Dominions could not have &quot;total&quot; control over their external concerns, but in 1934 the Status and Seals Acts were passed, granting the South African Parliament even greater power than the British government over the Union.

The extreme NP members of the 1930s were known collectively as the Republikeinse Bond. The following organisations, parties and events promoted the Republican ideal in the 1930s:
* The Broederbond
* The Purified National Party
* The FAK
* The Voortrekkers and 
* The 1938 Great Trek Centenary
* The 
* The Ossewabrandwag
* Pirow&#x27;s (New Order)
* The adjustment to and the national flag
===Daniël François Malan===
There was some confusion about the republican ideal during the war years. The &quot;Herenigde Nasionale Party&quot;, with Hertzog its leader, pushed the issue into the background. After Hertzog left the party, however, it became republican. In 1942 and 1944, D. F. Malan introduced a motion in the House of Assembly in favour of the establishment of a republic, but this was defeated.

When the NP came to power in 1948 (making it the first all-Afrikaner cabinet since 1910), there were two uppermost priorities that it was determined to fulfil:

* Find a solution to the racial problem.
* Lead South Africa to independence and republican status.

Between 1948 and 1961, Prime Ministers D. F. Malan, J. G. Strijdom and Hendrik Verwoerd all worked very hard for the latter, implementing a battery of policies and changes in a bid to increase the country&#x27;s autonomy. Divided loyalty, they felt, was holding South Africa back. They wanted to break the country&#x27;s ties with the United Kingdom and establish a republic, and many South Africans grew confident that a republic was possible.

Unfortunately for its republicans, the NP was not in a strong parliamentary position. Although it held a majority (only five) of seats, many of these were in rural constituencies, which had far fewer voters than urban constituencies. Malan appealed to many rural voters due to his agricultural policy, meaning black workers relied on white farmers for work, fuelling his quest for a segregated nation. The United Party held a 100,000-vote lead. Consequently, the NP had to rely on the Afrikaner Party&#x27;s support. It did not, therefore, have the groundswell of public support that it needed to win a referendum, and only when it had that majority on its side could a referendum be held on the republican matter. However, with a small seating majority and a total vote-tally minority, it was impossible for now for Malan and his ardently republican Nats to bring about a republic constitutionally. In the interim, the NP would have to consolidate itself and not antagonise the British.

Many English speakers did not want to break their ties with the United Kingdom. However, in 1949, at the 1949 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference in London (with Malan in attendance), India requested that, despite its newly attained republican status, it remain a member of the British Commonwealth. When this was granted the following year by the London Declaration, It roused much debate in South Africa between the pro-republican NP and the anti-republican UP (under Strauss). It meant that, even if South Africa did become a republic, it did not automatically have to sever all of its ties with the UK and the British Commonwealth. This gained the movement further support from the English-speaking populace, which was less worried about being isolated, and the republican ideal looked closer than ever to being fulfilled.

Although he could not make South Africa a republic, Malan could prepare the country for this eventuality. In his term of office, from 1948 to 1954, Malan took several steps to break ties with the UK:

* The South African Citizenship Act was passed in 1949. Before, South Africans were not citizens but rather subjects of the British Crown, regardless of whether they were permanent residents or had only recently migrated. The 1949 Act established South African citizenship. Before, British citizens needed a mere two years in the country to qualify as South Africans; now, British immigrants were just like any other immigrant: they would have to register and remain in South Africa for five years to become citizens of the country. It was believed that this could well influence a republican referendum. The Act ensured that the British immigrant population would not reduce the Afrikaner majority.
* In 1950, the right of appeal to the British Privy Council in London was terminated under the Privy Council Appeals Act. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein was now South Africa&#x27;s highest court.
* Malan was a crucial player in the move to get the word &quot;British&quot; taken away from &quot;British Commonwealth&quot;. This change was taken as an affirmation of the fact that all member countries were voluntary and equal members.
* In 1951, pro-republican Ernest George Jansen was assigned the post of Governor-General of South Africa. This endorsed the idea of Afrikaner leadership.
* The title of the just-crowned Queen was modified in 1953 from &quot;Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas&quot; to &quot;Elizabeth II, Queen of South Africa&quot;. This was meant to indicate that the South African upper house had bequeathed the title upon her.

The 1953 ballot votes saw the NP fortify its position considerably, winning comfortably but still falling well short of the clear majority it sought: it had 94 seats in parliament to the UP&#x27;s 57 and the Labour Party&#x27;s five.

===Hans Strijdom===
Malan retired in 1954 at the age of eighty. The two succession contenders were J. G. Strijdom (Minister of Lands and Irrigation) and Havenga (Minister of Finance). Malan personally preferred the latter and, indeed, recommended him. Malan and Strijdom had clashed frequently over the years, particularly on the question of whether a republican South Africa should be inside or outside the Commonwealth.

Strijdom, however, had the support of Verwoerd and Ben Schoeman, and he was eventually voted in as Prime Minister. Strijdom was a passionate and outspoken Afrikaner and republican who wholeheartedly supported apartheid. He was completely intolerant towards non-Afrikaners and liberal ideas, utterly determined to maintain White rule with zero compromise. Known as the &quot;Lion of the North&quot;, Strijdom made few changes to his cabinet and pursued with vigour the policy of apartheid. By 1956, he successfully placed the Coloureds on a separate voters&#x27; roll, thus further weakening ties with the Commonwealth and gaining support for the NP.

He also took several other steps to make South Africa less dependent on Britain:

* In 1955, the South African parliament became recognised as the highest authority.
* In 1957, following a motion from Arthur Barlow MP, the flag of the Union of South Africa became the country&#x27;s only flag; the Union Jack, alongside which the Union Flag had flown since 1928, was flown no longer, to be hoisted only on special occasions.
* Likewise, &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; (The Call of South Africa) became South Africa&#x27;s only national anthem and was also translated into English to appease the relevant population. God Save the Queen would be sung only on occasions relating to the UK or the Commonwealth.
* In 1957, the maritime base in Simonstown was reassigned from the command of the British Royal Navy to that of the South African government. The British had occupied Simonstown since 1806.
* In 1958, &quot;OHMS&quot; was replaced by &quot;Official&quot; on all official documents.
* C. R. Swart, another staunch Afrikaner republican, became the new Governor-General.

Anti-republican South Africans recognised the shift and distancing from Britain, and the UP grew increasingly anxious, doing all it could to persuade Parliament to retain Commonwealth links. Strijdom, however, declared that South Africa&#x27;s participation (or otherwise) in the Commonwealth would be determined only by its best interests.

===Hendrik Verwoerd===

The question of apartheid dominated the 1958 election, and the NP took 55% of the vote, thus winning a clear majority for the first time. When Strijdom died that same year, there was a tripartite succession contest between Swart, Dönges and Verwoerd. The latter, devoted to the cause of a republican South Africa, was the new Prime Minister. Verwoerd, a former Minister of Native Affairs, played a leading role in the institution of the apartheid system. Under his leadership, the NP solidified its control over South African apartheid-era politics.

To gain the support of the English-identified population of South Africa, Verwoerd appointed several English speakers to his cabinet. He also cited the radical political movements elsewhere in Africa as vindication of his belief that White and Black nationalism could not work within the same system. Verwoerd also presented the NP as the party best equipped to deal with the widely perceived threat of communism.

By the end of his term (caused by his assassination), Verwoerd had solidified the NP&#x27;s domination of South African politics. In the 1966 elections the party won 126 out of the 170 seats in Parliament.

By 1960, however, much of the South African electorate called for withdrawal from the Commonwealth and establishing South Africa as a republic. It was decided that a republican referendum was to be held in October. International circumstances made the referendum a growing necessity. In the aftermath of the World War II, former British colonies in Africa and Asia were gaining independence and publicising the ills of apartheid. Commonwealth members were determined to isolate South Africa.

There were numerous internal factors which had paved the way for and may be viewed as influences on the result:

* Harold Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Winds of Change&quot; speech, in which he declared that independence for Black Africans was an inevitability;
* Many Whites were unwilling to give up apartheid and realised that South Africa would have to go for it alone if it was to pursue its racial policies.
* The assertion that economic growth and relaxation of racial tensions could be achieved only through a republic;
* The Sharpeville Massacre;
* The attempted assassination of Verwoerd; and, most importantly,
* The 1960 census revealed more Afrikaners in the country than English, thus almost guaranteeing the NP victory in a republican referendum.

The opposition accused Verwoerd of trying to break from the Commonwealth and the West, thus losing South Africa&#x27;s trade preferences. The NP, however, launched a vigorously enthusiastic political campaign with widely advertised public meetings. The opposition found it very difficult to fight for the preservation of British links.

There were numerous pro-republican arguments:

* It would link more closely the two European language groups.
* It would eliminate confusion about South Africa&#x27;s constitutional position.
* The monarchy was essentially British, with no roots in South Africa.
* South Africans desired a home-grown Head of State.
* The Queen of South Africa, living abroad, inherited her title as the United Kingdom&#x27;s monarch without the assistance or approval of South Africa.
* In a republic, the Head of State would not be another country&#x27;s ruler but rather the elected representative of the nation, a unifying symbol.
* A republic symbolised a sovereign free, and independent state.
* South Africa could approach its internal problems more realistically since they would be strictly &quot;South African&quot; problems to be solved by South Africans rather than foreign intervention.
* It would clear the misconception amongst many Blacks in South Africa that foreigners had the final say in their affairs.

There were also numerous arguments the establishment of a republic:

* It could lead to a forced withdrawal from the Commonwealth.
* With the entire world in a state of political unrest, bordering on turmoil, it was dangerous to change South Africa&#x27;s political status.
* It could lead to isolation from allies.
* A republic would solve none of South Africa&#x27;s problems; it would only worsen them, especially the racial issue, to which the Commonwealth was increasingly opposed.
* The NP had supposedly not given one good reason for the change.
* The ruling party already had twelve years to bring about national unity but had only driven the two White sects further apart.
* A majority of just one vote could establish a republic. This did not entail unity nor, indeed, democracy.
* Countries did not generally change their form of government unless the present form was inefficient or unstable due to internal strife or hardship. Nothing like this had happened in (White) South Africa, where so many were so content.

On 5 October 1960, 90.5% of the White electorate turned out to vote on the issue. 850,458 (52%) voted in favour of a republic, while 775,878 were against it. The Cape, Orange Free State and Transvaal were all in favour; Natal, a mainly English-speaking province, was not. It was a narrow victory for the republicans. However, a considerable number of Afrikaners did vote against the measure. The few Blacks, Indians and Coloureds allowed to vote were decidedly against the measure.

English speakers who voted for a republic had done so on the condition that their cultural heritage be safeguarded. Many had associated a republic with the survival of the White South Africans. Macmillan&#x27;s speech illustrated that the British government was no longer prepared to stand by South Africa&#x27;s racist policies. Nevertheless, the referendum was a significant victory for Afrikaner nationalism as British political and cultural influence waned in South Africa.

However, one question remained after the referendum: would South Africa become a republic outside the Commonwealth (the outcome favoured by the most Afrikaner nationalists)? Withdrawal from the Commonwealth would likely alienate English speakers and damage relations with many other countries. Former British colonies such as India, Pakistan and Ghana were all republics within the Commonwealth, and Verwoerd announced that South Africa would follow suit &quot;if possible&quot;.

In January 1961, Verwoerd&#x27;s government enacted legislation to transform the Union of South Africa into the Republic of South Africa. The constitution was finalised in April. It merged the authority of the British Crown and Governor-General into a new post, State President of South Africa. The State President would have relatively little political power, serving more as the ceremonial head of state. The political power was to lie with the Prime Minister (head of government). The Republic of South Africa would also have its monetary system, employing Rand and Cents.

In March 1961, Verwoerd visited the 1961 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference in London to discuss South Africa becoming a republic within the Commonwealth, presenting the Republic of South Africa&#x27;s application for a renewal of its membership to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth had earlier declined to predict how republican status would affect South Africa&#x27;s membership; it did not want to be seen meddling in its members&#x27; domestic affairs. However, many of the Conference&#x27;s affiliates (prominent among them the Afro-Asia group and Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker) attacked South Africa&#x27;s racial policies and rebuffed Verwoerd&#x27;s application; they would go to any lengths to expel South Africa from the Commonwealth. Numerous anti-apartheid movements also campaigned for South Africa&#x27;s exclusion from the UK. Some member countries warned that they would pull out of the organisation unless South Africa were expelled. Verwoerd disregarded the censure, arguing that his Commonwealth cohorts had no right to question and criticise his country&#x27;s domestic affairs. On this issue, he even had the support of his parliamentary opposition.

Thus, on 15 March 1961, ostensibly to Britain an awkward decision and causing a split within the Commonwealth, but more likely to avoid further condemnation and embarrassment, Verwoerd withdrew his application and announced that South Africa would become a republic outside the Commonwealth. His decision was received with regret by the Prime Ministers of the UK, Australia and New Zealand but was met with obvious approval from South Africa&#x27;s critics. Verwoerd said the next day that the move would not affect South Africa&#x27;s relationship with the United Kingdom. On his homecoming, he was met with a rapturous reception. Afrikaner nationalists were not deterred by the relinquishment of Commonwealth membership, for they regarded the Commonwealth as little more than the British Empire in disguise. They believed that South Africa and the United Kingdom had absolutely nothing in common, and even UP leader Sir De Villiers Graaff praised Verwoerd for his handling of the situation.

On 31 May 1961, South Africa became a republic. The date was a significant one in Afrikaner history, as it heralded the anniversary of several historical events, the 1902 Treaty of Vereeniging, which ended the Anglo-Boer War; South Africa&#x27;s becoming a union in 1910; and the first hoisting of the Union flag in 1928. The Afrikaner republican dream had finally come to reality.

The significance of Commonwealth withdrawal turned out to be less than expected. It was not necessary for South Africa to amend its trading preferences, and Prime Minister Macmillan reciprocated Verwoerd&#x27;s assurance that withdrawal would not alter trade between South Africa and the UK.

South Africa now had its first independent constitution. However, the only real constitutional change was that the State President, in charge for seven years, would assume the now-vacant position of the Queen as Head of State. C. R. Swart, the State President-elect, took the first republican oath as State President of South Africa before Chief Justice L. C. Steyn (DRC).

Although White inhabitants were generally happy with the republic, united in their support of Verwoerd, the Blacks defiantly rejected the move. Nelson Mandela and his National Action Council demonstrated from 29 to 31 May 1961. The republican issue would strongly intensify resistance to apartheid.

In October 1961, Verwoerd appointed the National Party&#x27;s two first English-speaking ministers.

==Support==
The NP won most parliamentary seats in all elections during the apartheid era. Its popular vote record was more mixed: While it won the popular vote with a comfortable margin in most general elections, the NP carried less than 50% of the electorate in 1948, 1953, 1961, and 1989. In 1977, the NP got its best-ever result in the elections with the support of 64.8% of the White voters and 134 parliamentary seats out of 165. After this, the party&#x27;s consent declined as a proliferation of right-wing parties siphoned off important segments of its traditional voter base.

Throughout its reign, the party&#x27;s support came mainly from Afrikaners, but other White people were courted by and increasingly voted for the NP after 1960. By the 1980s, however, in reaction to the &quot;verligte&quot; reforms of P. W. Botha, the majority of Afrikaners drifted to the Conservative Party of Andries Treurnicht, who called for a return to the traditional policies of the NP. In the 1974 general elections for example 91% of Afrikaners voted for the NP; however, in the 1989 general elections, only 46% of Afrikaners cast their ballot for the National party.

==Division and decline==

===Factional warfare: &quot;Verkramptes&quot; and &quot;Verligtes&quot;===

Following the assassination of Verwoerd, John Vorster took over as party leader and Prime Minister. From the 1960s onwards, the NP and the Afrikaner population in general was increasingly divided over the application of apartheid (the legal opposition being similarly divided over its response), leading to the emergence of the &quot;&quot;verkramptes&quot; and &quot;verligtes&quot;. &quot;Verkramptes&quot; were members of the party&#x27;s right-wing who opposed any deviation from the rigid apartheid structure. &quot;Verligtes&quot; took a somewhat more moderate stance towards racial issues, primarily from a pragmatic standpoint over fears of international scrutiny should reforms fail to be made.

In addition to the question of apartheid, the two factions were divided over such issues as immigration, language, racially-mixed sporting teams, and engagement with Black African states. In 1969, members of the &quot;verkrampte&quot;&quot; faction including Albert Hertzog and Jaap Marais, formed the &quot;Herstigte Nasionale Party&quot;, which claimed to be the true upholder of pure Verwoerdian apartheid ideology and continues to exist today. While it never had much electoral success, it attracted sufficient numbers to erode support for the government at crucial points, although not to the extent that the Conservative Party would do. Meanwhile, the &quot;verligtes&quot; began to gain some traction inside the party in response to growing international opposition to apartheid.

Perhaps a precursor to the split came around 1960 when Japie Basson, a moderate, was expelled for disagreements on racial questions and would form his own National Union Party, he would later join the United Party and Progressive Federal Party before rejoining the NP in the 1980s. Former Interior Minister Theo Gerdener formed the Democratic Party in 1973 to attempt its own verligte solution to racial questions.

===National Party under Botha===
Beginning in the early 1980s, under the leadership of P. W. Botha, Prime Minister since 1978, the NP began to reform its policies. Botha legalised interracial marriages and multiracial political parties and relaxed the Group Areas Act. Botha also amended the constitution to grant a measure of political representation to Coloureds and Indians by creating separate parliamentary chambers in which they had control of their &quot;own affairs&quot;. The amendments also replaced the parliamentary system with a presidential one. The powers of the Prime Minister were essentially merged with those of the State President, which was vested with sweeping executive powers. Although portraying the new system as a power-sharing agreement, Botha ensured that the real power remained in White hands, and in practice, in the hands of the NP. Whites had large majorities in the electoral college which chose the State President, as well as on the President&#x27;s Council, which settled disputes between the three chambers and decided which combination of them could consider any piece of legislation. However, Botha and the NP refused to budge on the central issue of granting meaningful political rights to Black South Africans, who remained unrepresented even after the reforms. Most Black political organisations remained banned, and prominent Black leaders, including Nelson Mandela, remained imprisoned.

While Botha&#x27;s reforms did not even begin to meet the opposition&#x27;s demands, they sufficiently alarmed a segment of his own party to engender a second split. In 1982, hardline NP members including Andries Treurnicht and Ferdinand Hartzenberg formed the Conservative Party, committed to reversing Botha&#x27;s reforms, which by 1987 became the largest parliamentary opposition party. The party later merged into the Freedom Front, which today represents Afrikaner nationalism. On the other hand, some reformist NP members also left the party, such as Dennis Worrall and Wynand Malan, who formed the Independent Party which later merged into the Democratic Party (a similar breakaway group existed for a time in the 1970s). The loss of NP support to both the DP and CP reflected the divisions among White voters over continued maintenance of apartheid.

=== National Party under de Klerk and final years of apartheid ===

In the midst of rising political instability, growing economic problems and diplomatic isolation, Botha resigned as NP leader, and subsequently as State President in 1989. He was replaced by F. W. de Klerk in this capacity. Although conservative by inclination, De Klerk had become the leader of an &quot;enlightened&quot; NP faction that realised the impracticality of maintaining apartheid forever. He decided that it would be better to negotiate while there was still time to reach a compromise, than to hold out until forced to negotiate on less favourable terms later. He persuaded the NP to enter into negotiations with representatives of the Black community. Late in 1989, the NP won the most bitterly contested election in decades, pledging to negotiate an end to the very apartheid system that it had established.

On 2 February 1990, the African National Congress (ANC) was legalised, and Nelson Mandela was released after twenty-seven years of imprisonment. In the same year, the NP opened its membership to all racial groups and moves began to repeal the racial legislation which had been the foundations of apartheid. A referendum in 1992 gave De Klerk plenipotentiary powers to negotiate with Mandela. Following the negotiations, a new interim constitution was drawn up, and non-racial democratic elections were held in 1994. These elections were won by the African National Congress. The NP remained in government, however, as a coalition partner to the ANC in the Government of National Unity until 30 June 1996, when it withdrew to become the official opposition.

===Post-apartheid era===


The National Party won 20.39% of the vote and 82 seats in the National Assembly at the first multiracial election in 1994. This support extended well beyond the White community and into other minority groups. For instance, two-thirds of Indian South Africans voted for the NP. It became the official opposition in most provinces and also won a majority in the Western Cape, winning much of the White and Coloured vote. Its Coloured support also earned it a strong second place in the Northern Cape. The party was wracked by internal wranglings whilst it participated in the Government of National Unity, and finally withdrew from the government to become the official opposition in 1996. Despite this, it remained uncertain about its future direction, and was continually outperformed in parliament by the much smaller Democratic Party (DP), which provided a more forceful and principled opposition stance. In 1997, its voter base began to gradually shift to the DP. The NP renamed itself the New National Party towards the end of 1997, to distance itself from the apartheid past.

However, the NNP would quickly disappear from the political scene, faring poorly at both the 1999 and 2004 general elections. After initially aligning with the DP in 2000 (forming the Democratic Alliance), the merger was aborted, and after a back and forth on whether to oppose or work with the ANC, the NNP and ANC finally formed an alliance in late-2001. After years of losing members and support to other parties, the NNP&#x27;s collapse in its previous stronghold in the Western Cape at the 2004 general election proved to be the final straw; its federal council voted to dissolve the party on 9 April 2005, following a decision the previous year to merge with the ANC.

==Re-establishment==

On 5 August 2008 a new party using the name of &quot;National Party South Africa&quot; was formed and registered with the Independent Electoral Commission. The new party had no formal connection with the now defunct New National Party. The relaunched National Party of 2008 pushed for a non-racial democratic South Africa based on federal principles and the legacy of F. W. de Klerk.

<text>In hyperbolic geometry, the Klein quartic, named after Felix Klein, is a compact Riemann surface of genus with the highest possible order automorphism group for this genus, namely order orientation-preserving automorphisms, and automorphisms if orientation may be reversed. As such, the Klein quartic is the Hurwitz surface of lowest possible genus; see Hurwitz&#x27;s automorphisms theorem. Its (orientation-preserving) automorphism group is isomorphic to , the second-smallest non-abelian simple group after the alternating group A5. The quartic was first described in .

Klein&#x27;s quartic occurs in many branches of mathematics, in contexts including representation theory, homology theory, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, and the Stark–Heegner theorem on imaginary quadratic number fields of class number one; see for a survey of properties.

Originally, the &quot;Klein quartic&quot; referred specifically to the subset of the complex projective plane defined by an algebraic equation. This has a specific Riemannian metric (that makes it a minimal surface in ), under which its Gaussian curvature is not constant. But more commonly (as in this article) it is now thought of as any Riemann surface that is conformally equivalent to this algebraic curve, and especially the one that is a quotient of the hyperbolic plane by a certain cocompact group that acts freely on by isometries. This gives the Klein quartic a Riemannian metric of constant curvature that it inherits from . This set of conformally equivalent Riemannian surfaces is precisely the same as all compact Riemannian surfaces of genus 3 whose conformal automorphism group is isomorphic to the unique simple group of order 168. This group is also known as , and also as the isomorphic group . By covering space theory, the group mentioned above is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the compact surface of genus .

== Closed and open forms ==
It is important to distinguish two different forms of the quartic. The &quot;closed&quot; quartic is what is generally meant in geometry; topologically it has genus 3 and is a compact space. The &quot;open&quot; or &quot;punctured&quot; quartic is of interest in number theory; topologically it is a genus 3 surface with 24 punctures, and geometrically these punctures are cusps. The open quartic may be obtained (topologically) from the closed quartic by puncturing at the 24 centers of the tiling by regular heptagons, as discussed below. The open and closed quartics have different metrics, though they are both hyperbolic and complete – geometrically, the cusps are &quot;points at infinity&quot;, not holes, hence the open quartic is still complete.

==As an algebraic curve==
The Klein quartic can be viewed as a projective algebraic curve over the complex numbers , defined by the following quartic equation in homogeneous coordinates on :

:formula_1

The locus of this equation in is the original Riemannian surface that Klein described.

==Quaternion algebra construction==
The compact Klein quartic can be constructed as the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by the action of a suitable Fuchsian group which is the principal congruence subgroup associated with the ideal formula_2 in the ring of algebraic integers of the field where . Note the identity

:formula_3

exhibiting as a prime factor of 7 in the ring of algebraic integers.

The group is a subgroup of the (2,3,7) hyperbolic triangle group. Namely, is a subgroup of the group of elements of unit norm in the quaternion algebra generated as an associative algebra by the generators and relations

:formula_4

One chooses a suitable Hurwitz quaternion order formula_5 in the quaternion algebra, is then the group of norm 1 elements in formula_6. The least absolute value of a trace of a hyperbolic element in is formula_7, corresponding the value 3.936 for the systole of the Klein quartic, one of the highest in this genus.

==Tiling==

The Klein quartic admits tilings connected with the symmetry group (a &quot;regular map&quot;), and these are used in understanding the symmetry group, dating back to Klein&#x27;s original paper. Given a fundamental domain for the group action (for the full, orientation-reversing symmetry group, a (2,3,7) triangle), the reflection domains (images of this domain under the group) give a tiling of the quartic such that the automorphism group of the tiling equals the automorphism group of the surface – reflections in the lines of the tiling correspond to the reflections in the group (reflections in the lines of a given fundamental triangle give a set of 3 generating reflections). This tiling is a quotient of the order-3 bisected heptagonal tiling of the hyperbolic plane (the universal cover of the quartic), and all Hurwitz surfaces are tiled in the same way, as quotients.

This tiling is uniform but not regular (it is by scalene triangles), and often regular tilings are used instead. A quotient of any tiling in the (2,3,7) family can be used (and will have the same automorphism group); of these, the two regular tilings are the tiling by 24 regular hyperbolic heptagons, each of degree 3 (meeting at 56 vertices), and the dual tiling by 56 equilateral triangles, each of degree 7 (meeting at 24 vertices). The order of the automorphism group is related, being the number of polygons times the number of edges in the polygon in both cases.
:24 × 7 = 168
:56 × 3 = 168
The covering tilings on the hyperbolic plane are the order-3 heptagonal tiling and the order-7 triangular tiling.

The automorphism group can be augmented (by a symmetry which is not realized by a symmetry of the tiling) to yield the Mathieu group M24.

Corresponding to each &quot;tiling&quot; of the quartic (partition of the quartic variety into subsets) is an abstract polyhedron, which abstracts from the geometry and only reflects the combinatorics of the tiling (this is a general way of obtaining an abstract polytope from a tiling) – the vertices, edges, and faces of the polyhedron are equal as sets to the vertices, edges, and faces of the tiling, with the same incidence relations, and the (combinatorial) automorphism group of the abstract polyhedron equals the (geometric) automorphism group of the quartic. In this way the geometry reduces to combinatorics.

=== Affine quartic ===
The above is a tiling of the &quot;projective&quot; quartic (a closed manifold); the affine quartic has 24 cusps (topologically, punctures), which correspond to the 24 vertices of the regular triangular tiling, or equivalently the centers of the 24 heptagons in the heptagonal tiling, and can be realized as follows.

Considering the action of on the upper half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane by Möbius transformations, the affine Klein quartic can be realized as the quotient . (Here is the congruence subgroup of consisting of matrices that are congruent to the identity matrix when all entries are taken modulo 7.)

== Fundamental domain and pants decomposition ==
The Klein quartic can be obtained as the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by the action of a Fuchsian group. The fundamental domain is a regular 14-gon, which has area formula_8 by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. This can be seen in the adjoining figure, which also includes the 336 (2,3,7) triangles that tessellate the surface and generate its group of symmetries.

Within the tessellation by (2,3,7) triangles is a tessellation by 24 regular heptagons. The systole of the surface passes through the midpoints of 8 heptagon sides; for this reason it has been referred to as an &quot;eight step geodesic&quot; in the literature, and is the reason for the title of the book in the section below. All the coloured curves in the figure showing the pants decomposition are systoles, however, this is just a subset; there are 21 in total. The length of the systole is 
:formula_9

An equivalent closed formula is

:formula_10

Whilst the Klein quartic maximises the symmetry group for surfaces of genus 3, it does not maximise the systole length. The conjectured maximiser is the surface referred to as &quot;M3&quot; . M3 comes from a tessellation of (2,3,12) triangles, and its systole has multiplicity 24 and length
:formula_11

The Klein quartic can be decomposed into four pairs of pants by cutting along six of its systoles. This decomposition gives a symmetric set of Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates, where the length parameters are all equal to the length of the systole, and the twist parameters are all equal to formula_12 of the length of the systole. In particular, taking formula_13 to be the systole length, the coordinates are

:formula_14

The cubic graph corresponding to this pants decomposition is the tetrahedral graph, that is, the graph of 4 nodes, each connected to the other 3. The tetrahedral graph is similar to the graph for the projective Fano plane; indeed, the automorphism group of the Klein quartic is isomorphic to that of the Fano plane.

== Spectral theory ==

Little has been proved about the spectral theory of the Klein quartic. Because the Klein quartic has the largest symmetry group of surfaces in its topological class, much like the Bolza surface in genus 2, it has been conjectured that it maximises the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplace operator among all compact Riemann surfaces of genus 3 with constant negative curvature. It also maximizes mutliplicity of the first positive eigenvalue (8) among all such surfaces, a fact that has been recently proved. Eigenvalues of the Klein quartic have been calculated to varying degrees of accuracy. The first 15 distinct positive eigenvalues are shown in the following table, along with their multiplicities.

== 3-dimensional models ==

The Klein quartic cannot be &quot;realized&quot; as a 3-dimensional figure, in the sense that no 3-dimensional figure has (rotational) symmetries equal to , since does not embed as a subgroup of (or ) – it does not have a (non-trivial) 3-dimensional linear representation over the real numbers.

However, many 3-dimensional models of the Klein quartic have been given, starting in Klein&#x27;s original paper, which seek to demonstrate features of the quartic and preserve the symmetries topologically, though not all geometrically. The resulting models most often have either tetrahedral (order 12) or octahedral (order 24) symmetries; the remaining order 7 symmetry cannot be as easily visualized, and in fact is the title of Klein&#x27;s paper.
Most often, the quartic is modeled either by a smooth genus 3 surface with tetrahedral symmetry (replacing the edges of a regular tetrahedron with tubes/handles yields such a shape), which have been dubbed &quot;tetruses&quot;, or by polyhedral approximations, which have been dubbed &quot;tetroids&quot;; in both cases this is an &quot;embedding&quot; of the shape in 3 dimensions. The most notable smooth model (tetrus) is the sculpture &quot;The Eightfold Way&quot; by Helaman Ferguson at the Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute in Berkeley, California, made of marble and serpentine, and unveiled on November 14, 1993. The title refers to the fact that starting at any vertex of the triangulated surface and moving along any edge, if you alternately turn left and right when reaching a vertex, you always return to the original point after eight edges. The acquisition of the sculpture led in due course to the publication of a book of papers , detailing properties of the quartic and containing the first English translation of Klein&#x27;s paper. Polyhedral models with tetrahedral symmetry most often have convex hull a truncated tetrahedron – see and for examples and illustrations. Some of these models consist of 20 triangles or 56 triangles (abstractly, the regular skew polyhedron {3,7|,4}, with 56 faces, 84 edges, and 24 vertices), which cannot be realized as equilateral, with twists in the arms of the tetrahedron; while others have 24 heptagons – these heptagons can be taken to be planar, though non-convex, and the models are more complex than the triangular ones because the complexity is reflected in the shapes of the (non-flexible) heptagonal faces, rather than in the (flexible) vertices.
Alternatively, the quartic can be modeled by a polyhedron with octahedral symmetry: Klein modeled the quartic by a shape with octahedral symmetries and with points at infinity (an &quot;open polyhedron&quot;), namely three hyperboloids meeting on orthogonal axes, while it can also be modeled as a closed polyhedron which must be &quot;immersed&quot; (have self-intersections), not embedded. Such polyhedra may have various convex hulls, including the truncated cube, the snub cube, or the rhombicuboctahedron, as in the small cubicuboctahedron at right. The small cubicuboctahedron immersion is obtained by joining some of the triangles (2 triangles form a square, 6 form an octagon), which can be visualized by coloring the triangles (the corresponding tiling is topologically but not geometrically the 3 4 4 tiling). This immersion can also be used to geometrically construct the Mathieu group M24 by adding to PSL(2,7) the permutation which interchanges opposite points of the bisecting lines of the squares and octagons.

==Dessin d&#x27;enfants==
The dessin d&#x27;enfant on the Klein quartic associated with the quotient map by its automorphism group (with quotient the Riemann sphere) is precisely the 1-skeleton of the order-3 heptagonal tiling. That is, the quotient map is ramified over the points , and ; dividing by 1728 yields a Belyi function (ramified at , and ), where the 56 vertices (black points in dessin) lie over 0, the midpoints of the 84 edges (white points in dessin) lie over 1, and the centers of the 24 heptagons lie over infinity. The resulting dessin is a &quot;platonic&quot; dessin, meaning edge-transitive and &quot;clean&quot; (each white point has valence 2).

==Related Riemann surfaces==
The Klein quartic is related to various other Riemann surfaces.

Geometrically, it is the smallest Hurwitz surface (lowest genus); the next is the Macbeath surface (genus 7), and the following is the First Hurwitz triplet (3 surfaces of genus 14). More generally, it is the most symmetric surface of a given genus (being a Hurwitz surface); in this class, the Bolza surface is the most symmetric genus 2 surface, while Bring&#x27;s surface is a highly symmetric genus 4 surface – see isometries of Riemann surfaces for further discussion.

Algebraically, the (affine) Klein quartic is the modular curve X(7) and the projective Klein quartic is its compactification, just as the dodecahedron (with a cusp in the center of each face) is the modular curve X(5); this explains the relevance for number theory.

More subtly, the (projective) Klein quartic is a Shimura curve (as are the Hurwitz surfaces of genus 7 and 14), and as such parametrizes principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension 6.

More exceptionally, the Klein quartic forms part of a &quot;trinity&quot; in the sense of Vladimir Arnold, which can also be described as a McKay correspondence. In this collection, the projective special linear groups PSL(2,5), PSL(2,7), and PSL(2,11) (orders 60, 168, 660) are analogous. Note that 4 × 5 × 6/2 = 60, 6 × 7 × 8/2 = 168, and 10 × 11 × 12/2 = 660. These correspond to icosahedral symmetry (genus 0), the symmetries of the Klein quartic (genus 3), and the buckyball surface (genus 70). These are further connected to many other exceptional phenomena, which is elaborated at &quot;trinities&quot;.

<text>Youth For Understanding (YFU) is an international educational exchange organization. A network of over 45 independent national organizations worldwide, YFU representatives work together to advance learning across cultures.

Each year, YFU exchanges approximately 4,500 students worldwide.

==Organization==
YFU conducts its exchange programs via direct contact between independent national organizations in over 45 countries. These autonomous organizations represent the international community network of YFU. Other YFU international activities are carried out by a volunteer International Board and a professional staff known as the Global Office.
YFU organizations around the world subscribe to a set of basic operating and philosophic basic standards.
The umbrella body for national Youth For Understanding organisations across Europe is EEE-YFU.

==History of YFU==
Youth for Understanding was founded by Rachel Andresen. In 1951 it was proposed to church leaders in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA that teenagers from Germany be brought to the United States to live with a family and attend high school for a year. As a result, 75 German teenagers arrived in Michigan in July 1951 and were hosted by volunteer U.S. families.

The exchange program itself originated in late summer 1951 by the High Commission in Germany as the &quot;Urban/Rural Teen-Age Exchange Program&quot;. Already in its first year it was supported by members of the Michigan Council of Churches (MCC) under the motto &quot;Youth for Understanding&quot;. Within the next 10 years it evolved into two organizations YFU-USA and YFU-Germany. The first &quot;exchange&quot; from the United States to Germany was a summer program with 30 US high school students organized by MCC-alumni. During that year, Germany became a sovereign country, and the US government stopped funding the exchange program with Germany, which continued as a not-for-profit activity between the two YFU organizations. In 1961/62, a one-year exchange program from the US to Germany was added with 6 initial students from the US.
YFU Japan and YFU Mexico were established in 1958.

YFU, Inc., the non-profit educational organization, was established in 1964, and the organization&#x27;s offices were moved to Rosedale in Washington, D.C., in 1978.

On March 8, 2002, YFU, Inc. ceased operations and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy later that year.

The YFU organization in United States was reorganized as YFU USA Inc., which opened on March 9, 2002. The organization&#x27;s offices were moved to Bethesda, Maryland later in 2002. Ulrich Zahlten, founder and former chair of YFU Deutschland, became the new chairman of the board of YFU USA.

===Organization===
The guidelines for the work of the national YFU organizations will be decided by the International Advisory Council. The committee, which meets twice a year, consists of 15 representatives from national organizations. The national organisations from the United States, Germany and Japan as the largest members are constantly represented; the remaining sites are occupied in turn by other partners. The International Advisory Council is supported by the International Secretariat.

==European Educational Exchanges – Youth for Understanding==

European Educational Exchanges – Youth for Understanding (EEE-YFU) is an international youth exchange non-profit organisation, founded in 1985. It is the umbrella body for national Youth For Understanding organisations across Europe and consists of 28 members.

The mission of EEE-YFU is to advance intercultural understanding, mutual respect, and social responsibility through educational exchanges for youth, families, and communities.

YFU was founded shortly after the end of World War II, in 1951. It is one of the world&#x27;s oldest education exchange organisations and currently has programmes in about 60 countries around the world. Founded to allow young Germans the opportunity to experience another culture outside of their own, YFU organised for them to go on exchange to the United States to see what life was like there and to develop an understanding of democracy. Since then YFU has grown and now sends young people between 15 and 18 years old on international high school exchanges to other countries, where the students will live with and become a part of a host family. National YFU organisations from around the world are all independent from one another. However, there does exist an International Secretariat to facilitate co-operation and communication amongst them on a global scale, and to provide them with support.

EEE-YFU is a member organisation, and its members are national YFU organisations in Europe. Unlike the national YFU organisations, it is not involved with the actual logistics and organising of the exchanges. Instead, it is a member organisation which focuses on representing the interests of its members in several different ways. In supporting its members, EEE-YFU has the following aims: to promote intercultural understanding through youth exchange programmes in Europe; to enhance the public visibility for Youth For Understanding in Europe and with European institutions and organisations; to enrich the experience of European exchange students by facilitating educational and content related activities; to facilitate co-operation and networking between member organisations and to provide membership services; to facilitate intra-European activities such as seminars, meetings and conferences on various topics; and to assist in planning and conducting international training for staff and volunteers.

The organisation has its offices in Brussels, Belgium, where it works towards representing its members&#x27; interests at European level and to facilitate co-ordination between its national members.

The EEE-YFU board has the ultimate responsibility for the overall strategic direction of the organisation, as well as the European Secretariat based in its office in Brussels. The Secretariat regularly has interns and volunteers (often from the European Voluntary Service programme) working in the office.

EEE-YFU is an international non-profit organisation under Belgian law (AISBL).

EEE-YFU works alongside a number of external organisations, and is regularly granted funding for projects and initiatives by European institutions and other bodies. Its partners include the Council of Europe Directorate of Youth &amp; Sports, the European Commission, the European Youth Forum and the Platform for Intercultural Europe, as well as many others. It receives funding from the European Commission, the Council of Europe and the Belgian state, as well as other bodies. EEE-YFU also works closely with other NGOs involved in the youth field, particularly in relation to organising activities.

EEE-YFU works in three main areas: Capacity building; advocacy and representation; and knowledge building and networking.

The organisation fulfills its objectives by organising and facilitating educational activities to provide on-going education in cross-cultural issues to its students, returnees and volunteers. These help to promote intercultural dialogue and youth participation for a wide range of young people across Europe. EEE-YFU organises activities such as study sessions, trainings and seminars on various cultural and youth-related issues both nationally and on a European level. In doing so it often works closely with its member organisations. An important feature of EEE-YFU&#x27;s activities is to encourage those students who have participated in exchanges to continue to be involved with YFU by volunteering once they return home. This will help to continue the cycle of learning and will allow YFU to reach out to more young people.

EEE-YFU has its own &quot;European Trainer Network&quot;, composed of 13 young trainers from 10 different countries, which provides its member organisations with a pool of young people with relevant expertise and knowledge that they can use to organise and facilitate a range of events. This aims to help to increase the capacity for multiplication of competences and knowledge within the international YFU network, and for contributing to the development of training structures of national YFU organisations to provide high quality educational activities. EEE-YFU also has a &quot;Pool of Representatives&quot;, composed of 33 young people from various member organisations. The members are an important tool for EEE-YFU&#x27;s advocacy work, representing EEE-YFU on various seminars, working groups, meetings, conferences and other events.

The following YFU national organisations are members of EEE-YFU:
Austria, Belgium (Flanders &amp; Wallonia), Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Norway, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey.

<text>Mars Surveyor &#x27;98 was a mission in NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Program that launched the &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; and the Mars Polar Lander to the planet Mars. The mission was to study the Martian weather, climate, water and carbon dioxide (CO2) budget, to understand the reservoirs, behavior, and atmospheric role of volatiles and to search for evidence of long-term and episodic climate changes. The Mars Polar Lander also carried two surface-penetrator probes for the New Millennium Program&#x27;s Deep Space 2 mission. Both spacecraft were launched in 1998 and both were lost.

== Spacecraft ==
=== Orbiter ===

The orbiter was lost due to a miscalculation in trajectory caused by an unintended and undetected mismatch between metric and English units of measurement. The use of metric units as well as the data formats to employ were specified in a navigation software interface specification (SIS) published by JPL in 1996. Despite this, the flight operations team at Lockheed Martin provided impulse data in English units of pound-force seconds rather than newton seconds. These values were incorrect by a factor of 4.45 (1 lbf = 4.45 N). This caused erroneous course corrections that caused the orbiter to descend too low in Mars&#x27;s atmosphere. The vehicle either burned up or bounced off into space.

=== Lander ===

Investigators concluded that the most likely cause of the lander&#x27;s failure was a spurious sensor signal associated with the craft&#x27;s legs falsely indicating the craft had touched down when in fact it was some 40 meters above the surface. When the landing legs unfolded they made a bouncing motion that accidentally set off the landing sensors, causing the descent engines to shut down prematurely and the lander to fall. Another possible reason for failure was inadequate preheating of catalysis beds for the pulsing rocket thrusters. Hydrazine fuel decomposes on the beds to make hot gases that are forced out of the rocket nozzles, generating thrust; in crash review tests cold catalysis beds caused and instability.

== Mission ==
The Mars Surveyor 1998 program spacecraft development cost US$193.1 million. Launch costs for the Mars Surveyor &#x27;98 Program was estimated at US$91.7 million and mission operations at US$42.8 million. The Mars Climate Orbiter was part of NASA&#x27;s 10-year Mars Surveyor Program, with launches every 26 months when the Earth and Mars are favorably positioned.

<text>Melwin Cedeño (born December 27, 1964) is a Puerto Rican actor, comedian, host, and dancer. Cedeño is better known for his comedic performance as Chevy.

== Early years and studies ==

Melwin Cedeño was raised in Santa Isabel, Puerto Rico. His parents are Noel Cedeño and Lilina Irizarry. During childhood, he enjoyed making people laugh and admitted he was frequently &quot;kicked out of school for making jokes in the classroom&quot;. Cedeño began to pursue pre-med studies at the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico in Ponce. However, he dropped out, and moved to study Drama at the University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras.

== Career ==

While studying, Cedeño joined a local merengue orchestra called &quot;Los Nenes de Puerto Rico&quot;. His partners in the orchestra later became members of the popular group Límite 21. He also joined the university theatre group working in several plays like &quot;La Celestina&quot; and &quot;Bodas de Sangre&quot;. Cedeño also debuted in television shows in dramatic roles in soap operas such as &quot;Alejandra&quot;, &quot;Karina Montaner&quot;, and &quot;Apartamento de Solteras&quot; . He achieved recognition for his dramatic role as a young drug addict in the telenovela &quot;Andrea&quot;.

At the end of the 1980s, Cedeño started working as a comedian in popular shows like &quot;Show del Mediodía&quot; and &quot;El Kiosko Budweiser&quot;. It was during this time that his character of Chevy was born. According to him, he had played a Nuyorican character in the play &quot;Tres hombres y un bébe&quot;, which prompted actress Yasmín Mejías to invite him to participate in one segment of a Luisito Vigoreaux show called &quot;Cafetería la 15&quot;. &quot;They were looking for a &#x27;son&#x27; for the character of Georgina Borri ... Luis didn&#x27;t want me to play &#x27;Chevy&#x27;, but one day he wasn&#x27;t at work, I put on the glasses and the handkerchief... the place was about to fall down.&quot;

The popularity of the character spawned a daily show titled &quot;Con Lo Que Cuenta Este País&quot;, which debuted in 1991. It was broadcast by Telemundo Puerto Rico and produced by Hector Marcano. The show remained among the top shows in audience ratings for several years until its cancelation in 1993.

After that, Cedeño hosted the comedy game show &quot;Alto Voltaje&quot;, also produced by Marcano in Telemundo, but the show was canceled after just three months. After the end of the series, Cedeño decided to retire briefly from public life. He moved to the United States exploring offers from Telemundo and Univision. Eventually, he returned to Puerto Rico and continued working in theater and with brief comedic appearances in shows like &quot;Eso Vale&quot;.

In the late 1990s, Cedeño made a film titled &quot;Chevy... Episodio I&quot;, along with producer Gabriel Suau, marked the come-back of his popular character. As a result of the response to the film, Cedeño received an offer to host a new show for kids titled &quot;Pégate con Chevy&quot;. The show debuted in 2000, and received the acknowledgment of Puerto Rican children&#x27;s audiences. However, in 2002, the show was canceled despite its favorable reviews.

Cedeño still works regularly in television and theatre, and his character of &quot;Chevy&quot; remains popular among Puerto Ricans. He is currently a co-host in the show &quot;Pégate al Mediodía&quot;, along with Angelique Burgos, Jaime Mayol, and Natalia Rivera. Cedeño was initially brought in as a guest host but was made permanent when Mayol left to work on another show.

== Personal life ==

Melwin is currently married to former model and actress Phaedra Michalzik. They have two children together: Xander and Ackerly. Melwin has an adult son, Melwin Ahmed, from a previous relationship.

<text>A planchet is a round metal disk that is ready to be struck as a coin. An older word for planchet is flan. They are also referred to as blanks.

==History==
The preparation of the flan or planchet has varied over the years. In ancient times, the flan was heated before striking because the metal that the coin dies were made of was not as hard as dies today, and the dies would have worn faster and broken sooner had the flan not been heated to a high temperature to soften it.

An unusual method was used to mint the one-sided, bowl-shaped &quot;pfennigs&quot; of the Holy Roman Empire. The planchet used for these so-called &quot;Schüsselpfennigs&quot; was larger than the coin die itself. The coins were made by striking with only one upper die on the larger planchet. As a result, the perimeter of the planchet was pressed upwards in the shape of a bowl or plate. Until the 18th century they were minted mainly in the Harz Mountains. The curved shape of the pfennig was very useful for handling small change because it was easier to grip than a flat coin.

==Modern striking==
Today&#x27;s dies are made from hardened steel, and the presses use many thousands of pounds of force to strike coins (varying according to the size of the coin and the complexity and relief of the design). In addition, today&#x27;s coins have much lower relief than ancient coins. Because of this, the planchet no longer needs to be heated immediately before striking, although it is annealed by heating and slow cooling which softens the coin.

==Preparation==

Preparation of the modern planchet involves several steps. First, the metal (or metals in the case of clad or multilayered coins) is rolled out into a large roll or sheet of the correct thickness. This process is often done by third parties, not by the mint itself. These flat rolls or sheets of metal are then punched out into round blanks that are a little larger than the coin being struck. The blanks are then subjected to an annealing process that softens the metal through heating to approximately 750 degrees Celsius (1400 degrees Fahrenheit) and are then slowly air cooled. They are then washed to remove residue from the annealing process and dried.

==Completion==
Finally, the planchet is struck. After striking, it becomes a coin and is no longer a planchet. Occasionally, a planchet will escape the mint without having been struck. This is a blank planchet error, and is usually worth a few dollars for modern coins. Occasionally, blank planchets can be rare and valuable, such is the case for Morgan Dollar blank planchets, although authentication and appraisal by a coin grading service is highly recommended for such pieces as they would be fairly easy to counterfeit.

<doc id="390998" wikidata="Q1419007" url="?curid=390998" title="Nissan Pathfinder">
<text>The Nissan Pathfinder is a range of sport utility vehicles manufactured by Nissan since 1985. Until the third-generation model, the Pathfinder is based on Nissan&#x27;s compact pickup truck platform which it shares with the Navara/Frontier.

The Pathfinder was marketed as the outside North America. Beginning in 2004, the R51 series was marketed internationally as the Pathfinder.

In 2012, the R52 series Pathfinder was released as a three-row crossover SUV based on the unibody Nissan D platform, moving away from the body-on-frame chassis format. The role of a mid-size body-on-frame SUV in Nissan&#x27;s global lineup was passed to the Terra/X-Terra, which was released in 2018 and based on the D23 series Navara.


== First generation (YD21/WD21; 1985) ==
The first generation Pathfinder was unveiled in May 1985 and was later introduced in July 1986 as a two-door body-on-frame SUV, for the 1987 model year in the United States. It shared styling and most components with the Nissan Hardbody Truck. Built on a ladder-type frame, the Pathfinder was Nissan&#x27;s response to the Chevrolet Blazer, Ford Bronco II, Jeep Cherokee, and non-American SUVs like the Toyota 4Runner, Honda Passport, and the Isuzu MU.

Before the Pathfinder there was the Nissan Bushmaster (an aftermarket conversion of the Datsun Truck). Its optional 4WD system that could be engaged electronically while the vehicle was moving was unique at the time. All YD21 Pathfinders were available in both 2WD and manually engaged 4WD configurations, with base models installed with a 2.4 L four-cylinder engine. In certain countries, this generation also came with a 2.7-liter I4 diesel engine known as the TD27 with the option of a turbocharger installed later in November 1988.

In Japan, it was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Shop&quot; locations, where it was called the Terrano and served as a smaller companion to the larger Nissan Safari. While the Pathfinder/Terrano was essentially based on the newly introduced Hardbody truck, the rear five-link coil suspension was borrowed from the Safari to enhance its off-road abilities. In addition to the Station Wagon version (two or late four doors), the home market also received a version intended for commercial use called the &quot;Estate Van&quot; (chassis codes beginning with the letter &quot;V&quot;). The two-door version was available with the Nissan VG30i V6, which produces at 4800 rpm in Japanese market specifications.

As the Japanese market Terrano was regarded as a luxury vehicle, with an emphasis on outdoor leisure activities, the Terrano was introduced to Japanese buyers as an off-road, back-country Fairlady ZX. To emphasize this marketing approach, the Terrano was available with options not normally found on other budget-minded vehicles. Some of the upmarket Japanese-model options were climate-controlled air conditioning, electrically powered windows, seats, door locks, and, in 1993, Recaro seats. Nissan&#x27;s sports division Autech added special equipment packages, introducing the &quot;Wide R3M Urban&quot; and the &quot;AJ Limited&quot;. The &quot;Wide&quot; models used overfenders and larger bumpers which made their exterior dimensions exceed dimension regulations, thus incurring a higher annual road tax obligation. The Wide models were given the leading letter &quot;L&quot; in their model codes. The emphasis on luxury was partly due to a strong economy in Japan, in what is now regarded as the Japanese &quot;bubble economy&quot;.

In 1985, the first generation Terrano was entered in the ninth Paris to Dakar rally race, with continued entries in rally races for many years, winning multiple times in its category.

The four-door Pathfinder was introduced in October 1989 to enhance the Pathfinder&#x27;s market appeal, but the wheelbase and overall vehicle length were not extended to accommodate the rear doors. At its introduction to North America, 1985 to 1989 Pathfinders all came with a two-door body. For 1990 it became four door-only, although a small number of US 1990 Pathfinders came with the two-door body.

When the four-door version was introduced, Nissan chose to conceal the door handles as a part of the &quot;C&quot; pillar trim to make it appear like a two-door truck with a camper shell, with the conventional door handles on the front doors. This design tradition was used on all Nissan SUVs, including the Nissan Armada, Nissan Juke, Nissan Terrano II, and the Nissan Xterra. The front doors were slightly shortened to accommodate the rear doors.

From 1987 to 1989 Pathfinders were available with either the Nissan VG30i 3.0 L V6 (, torque), or the Nissan Z24i 2.4 L () I4 (the same engine choices as the Nissan Hardbody Truck). For 1990, the V6 received an upgrade from throttle body injection to a multi point fuel injection system. This engine was known as the VG30E, and was rated at and torque. Also in 1990, the Z24i was replaced with the KA24E. The first generation continued until 1995.

The first generation Nissan Pathfinder also sold in Indonesia from 1995 to 2006 as Nissan Terrano. Only available with four-door body, 2389 cc Z24 carburetted petrol engine (103 hp &amp; 182Nm), 2WD (4WD only available for 1995-1996 highest trim model) and 5-speed manual transmission. Only 17,801 units were sold during 11 years of production.

=== Facelifts ===
A facelift occurred in 1990 when the 4-door model was introduced. The front grille was revised, numerous interior trim level options became available and numerous exterior packages were offered by dealerships. The 1993 models received a third brake light and the 1994 models received a curved dashboard. Two more facelifts occurred for Indonesian production Terrano in 1997 and 2003.


== Second generation (R50; 1995) ==
The second generation Pathfinder was introduced in late 1995 with revised styling. The engine was upgraded to the VG33E, with and torque. For the 1999 model year, the Pathfinder was freshened. In 2000, model year 2001 brought a new V6 engine (for the automatic transmission models). The manual transmission models boasted and 240-lbft of torque. This engine was the VQ35DE. The 4-cylinder engine option was no longer available, and diesel engines continued to be used in Japanese and European models.

As of the 2002 model year, the Terrano / Pathfinder was no longer marketed in Japan, and was available in North America, Europe and the Middle East. The market position held by the Terrano in Japan was replaced by the Nissan Murano in 2002. The Japanese market Terrano and high luxury content Terrano Regulus saw demand drop significantly due to the hard economic times felt in Japan, known as the Lost Decade. Nissan offered a smaller, off-road vehicle to its Japanese customer base who enjoyed the Pathfinder when it introduced the Nissan X-Trail in 2000.

=== Facelifts ===
The Pathfinder received a facelift in 1998 for the 1999.5 model year with a revised front fascia, rear fascia, and interior — followed by another facelift occurred in 2001 for the 2002 model year, receiving the updated Nissan logo, a revised grille, as well as a new steering wheel, different rims and radio display.

=== Infiniti QX4/Terrano Regulus ===
The Infiniti QX4 is a mid-size luxury SUV introduced in September 1996 and based on the Nissan Pathfinder. It was released following Acura&#x27;s introduction of the SLX and Lexus&#x27;s larger LX 450. The QX4 was Infiniti&#x27;s first entry into the SUV market segment.

It was available in Japan as the Nissan Terrano Regulus and exclusive at Nissan&#x27;s JDM &quot;Nissan Store&quot;. Major differences between these vehicles and the regular Pathfinder/Terrano include a more upscale interior and unique styling. Marketed as a luxury vehicle, The Terrano Regulus offered off-road capability with a low-range four-wheel-drive system and of ground clearance. In Japan, two four-cylinder diesel engines were also available. The US-market engine was the same 3.3-liter V6 unit as used in the Pathfinder, producing at 4,800 rpm and at 4,800 rpm. This was generally considered underpowered for the segment, with a 0– time of 12.4 seconds in period testing. In 1999, the Terrano was exclusive to reorganized Nissan JDM &quot;Nissan Blue Stage&quot; dealerships.

==== Year-to-year changes ====
The Terrano Regulus was updated in February 1999. The interior design was revised, while the old QD32ETi overhead valve turbodiesel was replaced with the new DOHC, 16-valve ZD30DDTi unit. The VG33E engine continued unchanged, but with the added option of two-wheel-drive.

The QX4 received its first major update in March 2000, as an early introduction for model year 2001. The biggest change was the new VQ series V6 engine (also later seen in the G35 and FX35), increasing its power from a relatively low . The displacement went from 3.3 L to 3.5 L. The timing belt was replaced with a timing chain and the ignition distributor was replaced with an individual coil ignition system. The revised version was introduced at the same price as the earlier model, in spite of the extra power and other improvements.

This facelift also gave the QX4 an updated exterior and interior body style, including a new grille and bumpers, reworked Xenon HID headlamps and redesigned taillights, a new dash with integrated analog clock, and alloy wheels. Also, a rear-wheel drive QX4 model was added (1997 through 2000 were only available in 4WD).

The Terrano Regulus continued to use the VG33E engine (and the 3-liter turbodiesel inline-four), although the short-lived V6 2WD option was discontinued again in September 2001, along with some minor changes.

2002 Infiniti QX: Cruise control designed to maintain a set distance from other traffic was the main addition for 2002. The QX4 shared Nissan&#x27;s Intelligent Cruise Control with Infiniti&#x27;s flagship Q45 sedan. Employing laser sensors, the system was designed to automatically speed or slow the QX4 to keep it a constant distance from cars ahead. Also new for 2002 was a revised audio system, plus audio controls for the available leather/wood steering wheel. The optional rear-seat video entertainment system offered a choice of VCR or DVD player. The Japanese-market Terrano Regulus was discontinued in August 2002.

2003 Infiniti QX: Additional standard equipment for 2003 included curtain-type side airbags, available for the first time. New standard equipment that had previously been part of the Premium Package included 17-inch wheels, a driver-seat memory system, and a leather/woodgrain steering wheel with audio controls. Options included heated front/rear seats and a videotape or DVD rear-seat entertainment system. A power moonroof that came standard.

The QX4 was discontinued in 2003, and its position in price was taken by the FX35/45 crossover SUV. The last QX4 was manufactured during November 2002. The QX4 was succeeded by the larger QX56 in 2004.


== Third generation (R51; 2004) ==
In August 2003, Nissan unveiled Dunehawk Concept and showcased it at the IAA 2003 in Frankfurt (R51 design patents filed 8 September 2003), previewing the next Pathfinder&#x27;s design. At the 2004 North American International Auto Show, Nissan unveiled a completely redesigned Pathfinder for the 2005 model year. The new R51 Pathfinder uses the Nissan F-Alpha platform. It is powered by a 4.0 L V6 engine VQ40DE (, ) or a 2.5 L YD25DDT (, ) turbodiesel.

The larger Pathfinder Armada debuted in late 2003, but was based on the Titan full-sized pickup truck and dropped the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; prefix in 2005.

The 2005 model introduced a third row of seats to the Pathfinder line for the first time.

=== 2008 facelift (US and Middle East) ===
The facelifted 2008 Pathfinder debuted at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show. Some of the badge positions on the rear liftgate were tweaked, and this version also received the Titan&#x27;s 5.6-liter V8 engine rated at and .

=== 2010 facelift (Europe, South America, Asia/Oceania, Caribbean) ===
An updated version debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in 2010, now available with the Nissan V9X Engine 3.0-litre V6 turbodiesel producing and at 1,750 – 2,500 rpm while the upgraded YD25DDTi turbodiesel also available produces – up – while torque increased by to . Over the combined cycle manual versions use 8.4 L/100 km – an improvement of 1.4 L/100 km – while emissions have fallen by 40g/km to 224 g/km. Both figures were class competitive at the time. A version of the engine with a diesel particulate filter (DPF) was also available in certain markets.

The R51 series Pathfinder continues to be sold and produced outside North America.

==== Exterior changes ====
The revised models have been given a new look front and rear to differentiate them from their predecessors. Changes at the front include a new bonnet, revised grille and a new bumper assembly. Adding 80 mm to the length of both models, the bumper is more rounded and lends a more sporting touch to the cars.

A new headlamp design with projectors is offered for Xenon lamps. Headlamps washers now pop up from beneath body color moulding in the bumpers. A new alloy wheel complements the existing range of 16-inch (steel and alloy) and 17-inch (alloy) designs. V8 models are given a discreet V8 badge at the leading edge of both front doors and a new side moulding across the doors.


== Fourth generation (R52; 2012) ==
A redesigned Pathfinder went on sale in late October 2012 as a 2013 model. It moved away from a body-on-frame, truck-based SUV and adopted a unibody design. It rides on the same platform as the Infiniti QX60, Altima, Maxima, Murano and Quest. This generation Pathfinder has an interior similar to the second generation Murano, the Infiniti QX60, and some more SUVs and sedans. The third row has more leg room than the Nissan Rogue.

A concept, nearly identical to the eventual production model, was first revealed at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. Retail availability was scheduled for September 2012. The new Pathfinder is only available with a &quot;VQ35DE&quot; 3.5-liter V6 engine producing and of torque. City, highway and combined average fuel economy numbers are 20 (City), 26 (Highway) and 22 (Combined) mpg for the FWD version and 19 (City), 25 (Highway) and 21 (Combined) mpg for the 4WD version. The Pathfinder is now significantly lighter than the previous generation, with the FWD model weighing 4149 pounds, while the 4WD Pathfinder weighs 4290 pounds.

This generation also abandons having the rear door handles hidden on the C pillar, a design feature of the first three generations of Pathfinders. As of 2015, the R52 series is only available in North America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and the Middle East. It is not produced or sold in Japan.

* 3.5-liter V6 models available late summer 2013

The Li-ion battery fits under the third row seat, with no effect on space used for cargo or passengers. The Pathfinder Hybrid also has hybrid emblems and hybrid LED taillights versus the non-hybrid model.

Nissan discontinued the Pathfinder Hybrid after the 2014 model year due to owner reviews and complaints that they could not get gas milage that was anywhere close to the advertised 25 to 28 mpg and limited availability and poor sales in the United States (discontinued after the 2015 model year in Canada and in other global markets except Australia and New Zealand).

A Motion Activated Liftgate is also now standard on SL and Platinum trim levels only as part of the power liftgate. The 2017 model year is also its 30th anniversary for the Nissan Pathfinder but there won&#x27;t be any 30th anniversary special edition model for the 2017 Pathfinder. But the Nissan Pathfinder will have a Midnight Edition trim level which will be higher than the Platinum trim level for its base MSRP and arrive in early 2017 and the Nissan Altima, Sentra, Murano, Maxima and Rogue will also add the Midnight Edition trim level to their trim lineups in early 2017.

=== 2019 update ===
The Rock Creek Edition package is introduced to the Nissan Pathfinder for the 2019 model year. The appearance package is only available on the SV and SL trim levels.

<text>Kevyn William Adams (born October 8, 1974) is an American former professional ice hockey center and current general manager of the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League. During his career, Adams played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Columbus Blue Jackets, Florida Panthers, Carolina Hurricanes, Phoenix Coyotes and the Chicago Blackhawks, and was also a former associate coach for the Sabres.

== Playing career ==

=== Amateur ===
Adams grew up in Clarence, New York and played his youth hockey for the Wheatfield Blades organization at a rink then known as Sabreland, where the Buffalo Sabres used to practice. Adams played collegiately for Miami University and was drafted in the 1st round, 25th overall by the Boston Bruins in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. He would choose to spend the duration of his rookie contract playing for Miami University, never playing a game for Boston. During the 1996–97 season, Adams would play for the Grand Rapids Griffins in the International Hockey League (IHL) where he would score 47 points in 82 games.

=== Toronto Maple Leafs ===
On August 7, 1997, Adams would sign with the Toronto Maple Leafs from free agency. He would spend his entire tenure between the Toronto Maple Leafs and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs, spending most of his time in the AHL. Adams would make his NHL debut on October 10, 1997 in a 4–1 loss to the Washington Capitals. It wouldn&#x27;t be until the 1999–2000 season where Adams would start playing regularly at the NHL level, playing 52 games and scoring 14 points. On January 3, 2000, Adams would score his first NHL goal against goaltender Dwayne Roloson in a 6–2 win against the Buffalo Sabres.

=== Columbus Blue Jackets ===
Adams was drafted by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 2000 NHL expansion draft. He would score his first 2 goals with the team on October 12, 2000 in a 3–2 win over the Calgary Flames. Adams would score 22 points in 66 games with the Blue Jackets before being traded at the trade deadline to the Florida Panthers alongside a 4th round pick in the 2001 NHL entry draft (Mike Woodford) in exchange for Ray Whitney and future considerations.

=== Florida Panthers ===
After arriving in Florida, Adams would score his first 2 goals with the team on March 21, 2001 in a 3–1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs, his former team. The following season Adams would regress slightly, scoring 12 points in 44 games. On January 16, 2002, Adams would be traded alongside Bret Hedican and Tomáš Malec to the Carolina Hurricanes for Sandis Ozoliņš and Byron Ritchie.

=== Carolina Hurricanes ===
Adams would struggle at first with Carolina, scoring only 5 points in 33 games. He would bounce back in the next two seasons, scoring 20 points during the 2002–03 season and 26 points during the 2003–04 season. The Hurricanes would also make a deep playoff run during this time, making it all the way to the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings. During the playoffs, Adams would score a single point in 23 games, which was a single goal in game 6 against the Montreal Canadiens. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Adams would play for the DEG Metro Stars in Düsseldorf, Germany in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL).

Adams would return to the Hurricanes in the 2005–06 season, signing a two-year deal with the team and being assigned as an alternate captain behind Rod Brind&#x27;Amour. He would score two hat tricks in the span of one month, the first being against the New York Rangers on November 17, 2005, and the second being against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on December 6, 2005. The Carolina Hurricanes would make the playoffs, defeating the Montreal Canadiens, New Jersey Devils, and Buffalo Sabres to secure their spot in the Stanley Cup Finals. Carolina would face the Edmonton Oilers in a series that would go to a game 7, which the Hurricanes would win, giving Adams his first Stanley Cup victory. Despite being an alternate captain and playing in every game in the postseason, Adams would fail to score a single point in the playoffs. Adams would continue to struggle, as during the 2006–07 season, he would only score 4 points in 35 games before being traded on January 8, 2007 to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for Dennis Seidenberg.

=== Phoenix Coyotes ===
Adams would finish the season with Phoenix, scoring 8 points in 33 games on the team. However, his stint with the team would be brief, as before the 2007–08 season began, Adams would be traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for Radim Vrbata.

=== Chicago Blackhawks and retirement ===
Adams wouldn&#x27;t do much on the Blackhawks, missing most of the season after tearing his ACL. He would only play 27 games throughout the season, scoring only 2 points in that time. Despite being invited to training camp before the 2008–09 season began, Adams would be released by the Blackhawks on October 7, 2008. Months later on January 6, 2009, Adams announced his retirement to become a player–agent.

== Coaching and management career ==
On August 3, 2011, Adams was named Assistant Coach of the Buffalo Sabres. He was fired on May 9, 2013, two days after the Sabres named Ron Rolston as their new head coach. Adams was named the Senior Vice President of Business Administration for the Sabres in 2019. On June 16, 2020, he was named the team&#x27;s general manager, replacing the recently-fired Jason Botterill. 
On March 25, 2021, Adams filled in as head coach of the Sabres when head coach Don Granato and assistant coach Matt Ellis entered the NHL&#x27;s COVID protocol. The Sabres lost the game, 4–0, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, extending the Sabres winless streak to sixteen games.

== Personal life ==
Adams was the second player in NHL history, after Bill Nyrop, to be born in the District of Columbia. Despite being born in the D.C. area, Adams grew up in Clarence, New York, and keeps a second home in Bemus Point, New York. He was inducted into the Miami University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2011.

<doc id="391005" wikidata="Q664921" url="?curid=391005" title="David Aebischer">
<text>David Aebischer (born February 7, 1978) is a Swiss former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League with the Colorado Avalanche, Montreal Canadiens and the Phoenix Coyotes. He was a member of the 2001 Stanley Cup champion Avalanche team, becoming the first Swiss native to achieve the feat. Aebischer also played several seasons in his native Switzerland with HC Fribourg-Gottéron, HC Lugano and the Rapperswil-Jona Lakers of the National League (NL).

Aebischer is currently a goalie coach for HC Fribourg-Gottéron.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Aebischer played in the 1992 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Switzerland.

Aebischer was drafted 161st overall by the Colorado Avalanche in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. He moved to North America in 1997 and spent the 1997–98 season in the ECHL, first with the Chesapeake Icebreakers and then with the Wheeling Nailers. He spent the next two seasons with Colorado&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hershey Bears, with whom he compiled a 46-33-7 record. When the Avalanche traded backup goaltender Marc Denis to the Columbus Blue Jackets in the summer of 2000, Aebischer became the full-time backup to starting goaltender Patrick Roy.

Aebischer played 26 games during his rookie season with Colorado. Aebischer made his NHL debut, and first NHL start on October 18, 2000 against the Columbus Blue Jackets in Columbus for his first NHL victory. On October 26, 2000 in his second career start, Aebischer shut out the Chicago Blackhawks in Chicago for his first NHL career shutout. The year would prove a successful one, as Roy backstopped the Avalanche to their second Stanley Cup championship, defeating the New Jersey Devils in a seven-game final series. With the win, Aebischer became the first Swiss hockey player to win the Stanley Cup.

Following two more seasons as the Avalanche backup, Aebischer became Colorado&#x27;s starting goaltender following Roy&#x27;s retirement in the summer of 2003. He played 62 games and posted 32 wins during the 2003–04 season. That season, he started his first career playoff game for the Avalanche and led Colorado to the second round, where they lost to the San Jose Sharks in six games. The following season, due to the NHL lockout, Aebischer returned to Switzerland and played for HC Lugano in the Nationalliga A.

Aebischer returned to the Avalanche for the 2005–06 season. He was unable to duplicate his pre-lockout form and his inconsistent play led to him being traded to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for goaltender José Théodore on March 8, 2006, a day before the NHL trade deadline.

That summer, Montreal re-signed him to a one-year deal worth $1.9 million. He served as Cristobal Huet&#x27;s backup for the 2006–07 season and posted a 13–12–3 record. The Canadiens failed to make the playoffs and Montreal opted not to re-sign Aebischer.

On July 19, 2007, Aebischer signed a one-year, $600,000 contract with the Phoenix Coyotes. However, he lost the goaltending battle in training camp to Alex Auld and Mikael Tellqvist, and was waived. He went unclaimed and was subsequently assigned to the Coyotes AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage. On November 23, 2007, Aebischer was loaned to HC Lugano to make room on the San Antonio roster for goaltender Alex Auld.


In August, 2011, after four seasons back in his native Switzerland, Aebischer was invited to the training camp of the Winnipeg Jets for the 2011–12 season on a tryout contract. On October 5, 2011, it was announced that Aebischer would play with the Jets&#x27; AHL affiliate, the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps.

On July 1, 2012, Aebischer again left North America and signed a one-year contract with the Rapperswil-Jona Lakers of the National League A.

In the 2014–15 season, Aebischer played five games with HC Thurgau of the National League B before announcing his retirement from his playing career to focus for a coaching role on January 25, 2015.

==International play==
Aebischer has represented Switzerland internationally on many occasions. His first international experience came in the 1997 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, hosted by Switzerland. The Swiss finished in 7th place. Aebischer returned as Switzerland&#x27;s starting goaltender the following year at the 1998 World Juniors and led the team past the quarterfinal round and to a bronze medal finish, defeating the heavily favoured Czech Republic in the bronze medal match. Aebischer has also appeared for Switzerland in five IIHF World Championships and two Winter Olympic Games.

<text>A list of diesel locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works since 1939. The Baldwin Locomotive Works (BLW) was an American manufacturer of railway locomotives from 1825 to 1951. Originally located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, it moved to nearby Eddystone in the early 20th century. The company was for decades the world&#x27;s largest producer of steam locomotives, but struggled to compete when demand switched to diesel locomotives. Baldwin produced the last of its 70,000-plus locomotives in 1951, before merging with the Lima-Hamilton Corporation on September 11, 1951, to form the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation.

<doc id="391011" wikidata="Q1107297" url="?curid=391011" title="Coit Tower">
<text>Coit Tower (also known as Coit Memorial Tower) is a tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California, overlooking the city and San Francisco Bay. The tower, in the city&#x27;s Pioneer Park, was built between 1932 and 1933 using Lillie Hitchcock Coit&#x27;s bequest to beautify the city of San Francisco. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 29, 2008.

The Art Deco tower, built of unpainted reinforced concrete, was designed by architects Arthur Brown Jr. and Henry Temple Howard. The interior features fresco murals in the American Social Realism style, painted by 22 different onsite artists and their numerous assistants. Three artists preferred oil on canvas and worked offsite. One artist preferred egg tempera rather than fresco.

It is often erroneously stated that the structure was dedicated to the volunteer firemen who had died in San Francisco&#x27;s five major fires, but that is not accurate. The tower was constructed as the result of a bequest by Lillie Hitchcock Coit, whose will included two bequests, one to create a memorial to the city&#x27;s volunteer firefighters, which was done by statuary in Washington Square, and the other to beautify the city. Coit Tower is the result of the second bequest. A concrete relief of a phoenix by sculptor Robert Boardman Howard is placed above the main entrance. It was commissioned by the architect and cast as part of the building.

Although an apocryphal story claims that the tower was designed to resemble a fire hose nozzle due to Coit&#x27;s affinity with the San Francisco firefighters of the day, the resemblance is coincidental.

==History==

Telegraph Hill, the tower&#x27;s location, has been described as &quot;the most optimal 360 degree viewing point to the San Francisco Bay and five surrounding counties.&quot; In 1849, it became the site of a two-story observation deck, from which information about incoming ships was broadcast to city residents using an optical semaphore system, replaced in 1853 by an electrical telegraph that was destroyed by a storm in 1870.

Coit Tower was paid for with money left by Lillie Hitchcock Coit (1843–1929), a wealthy socialite who loved to chase fires in the early days of the city&#x27;s history. Before December 1866, there was no city fire department, and fires in the city, which broke out regularly in the wooden buildings, were extinguished by several volunteer fire companies. Coit was one of the more eccentric characters in the history of North Beach and Telegraph Hill, smoking cigars and wearing trousers long before it was socially acceptable for women to do so. She was an avid gambler and often dressed like a man in order to gamble in the males-only establishments that dotted North Beach.
Coit&#x27;s fortune funded the monument four years following her death in 1929. She had a special relationship with the city&#x27;s firefighters. At the age of fifteen she witnessed the Knickerbocker Engine Co. No. 5 in response to a fire call up on Telegraph Hill when they were shorthanded; she threw her school books to the ground and pitched in to help, calling out to other bystanders to help get the engine up the hill to the fire, to get the first water onto the blaze. After that Coit became the Engine Co. mascot and could barely be constrained by her parents from jumping into action at the sound of every fire bell. She frequently rode with the Knickerbocker Engine Co. 5, especially in street parades and celebrations in which the Engine Co. participated. Through her youth and adulthood Coit was recognized as an honorary firefighter.

In her will she specified that one third of her fortune, amounting to $118,000, &quot;be expended in an appropriate manner for the purpose of adding to the beauty of the city which I have always loved.&quot; Two memorials were built in her name. One was Coit Tower, and the other was a sculpture depicting three firemen, one of them carrying a woman in his arms.

The San Francisco County Board of Supervisors proposed that Coit&#x27;s bequest be used for a road at Lake Merced. This proposal brought disapproval from the estate&#x27;s executors, who expressed a desire that the county find &quot;ways and means of expending this money on a memorial that in itself would be an entity and not a unit of public development&quot;. Art Commission president Herbert Fleishhacker suggested a memorial on Telegraph Hill, which was approved by the estate executors. An additional $7,000 in city funds was appropriated, and a design competition was initiated. The winner was architect Arthur Brown, Jr, whose design was completed and dedicated on October 8, 1933.

The following month Honore Bowlby-Gledhill, proprietor of the Dead Fish Cafe (an &#x27;artists&#x27; restaurant&#x27;) in Telegraph Hill, was charged (under the name &#x27;Helen Smith&#x27;) with shooting a pistol at the tower. Bowlby-Gledhill was quoted as objecting to the tower because it &#x27;looked like a silo&#x27;.

Coit Tower was listed as a San Francisco Designated Landmark in 1984 and on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Although Coit Tower itself is not technically a California Historical Landmark, the state historical plaque for Telegraph Hill is located in the tower&#x27;s lobby, marking the site of the original signal station.

The San Francisco Arts Commission ordered the removal of the Statue of Christopher Columbus that had stood outside the entrance of the tower since 1957, following numerous other removals of controversial statues during the George Floyd protests that began in May 2020, and it was removed on June 18, 2020.

==Architecture==
Brown&#x27;s competition design envisioned a restaurant in the tower, which was changed to an exhibition area in the final version. The design uses three nesting concrete cylinders, the outermost a tapering fluted shaft that supports the viewing platform. An intermediate shaft contains a stairway, and an inner shaft houses the elevator. The observation deck is below the top, with an arcade and skylights above it. A rotunda at the base houses display space and a gift shop.

Potable water is pumped from a water main at street level to two tanks on the fifth floor, and gravity is used to feed all systems in the tower; a booster pump was installed later at the tanks to provide adequate pressure for the restrooms. Because of this arrangement, the murals (on the second and ground floors) are vulnerable to water damage from system leaks, which could be avoided if adequate pressure was available from the water supply at the street.

==Mural project==


The Coit Tower murals in the American Social Realism style formed the pilot project of the Public Works of Art Project, the first of the New Deal federal employment programs for artists. Ralph Stackpole and Bernard Zakheim successfully sought the commission in 1933, and supervised the muralists, including Maxine Albro, Victor Arnautoff, Jane Berlandina, Ray Bertrand, Ray Boynton, Ralph Chessé, Rinaldo Cuneo, Ben Cunningham, Mallette &quot;Harold&quot; Dean, Parker Hall, Edith Hamlin, George Albert Harris, William Hesthal, John Langley Howard, Lucien Labaudt, Gordon Langdon, Jose Moya del Pino Otis Oldfield, Frederick Olmsted Jr., Suzanne Scheuer, Edward Terada, Frede Vidar, and Clifford Wight. Many were faculty and students of the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA).

These artists (chosen by Walter Heil, director of the de Young Museum, together with other officials) were each paid $25 to $45 per week to depict &quot;aspects of life in California.&quot; The most well-known of them were assigned sections that were in size, while less famous artists were confined to .


===Themes===
The artists were committed in varying degrees to racial equality and to leftist and Marxist political ideas, which are strongly expressed in the paintings. Bernard Zakheim&#x27;s mural &quot;Library&quot; depicts fellow artist John Langley Howard crumpling a newspaper in his left hand as he reaches for a shelved copy of Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot; (here spelled as &quot;Das Capital&quot;) with his right. Workers of all races are shown as equals, often in the heroic poses of Socialist realism, while well-dressed racially white members of the capitalist classes enjoy the fruit of their labor.

Victor Arnautoff&#x27;s &quot;City Life&quot; includes the periodicals &quot;The New Masses&quot; and &quot;The Daily Worker&quot; in the scene&#x27;s news stand rack.

John Langley Howard&#x27;s mural &quot;California Industrial Scenes&quot; depicts an ethnically diverse Labor March as well as showing a destitute family panning for gold while a wealthy, heavily caricatured ensemble observes.

Stackpole&#x27;s &quot;Industries of California&quot; was composed along the same lines as an early study of the destroyed &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot;.

The youngest of the muralists, George Albert Harris, painted a mural called &quot;Banking and Law&quot; . In the mural, the world of finance is represented by the Federal Reserve Bank and a stock market ticker (in which stocks are shown as declining) and law is illustrated by a law library. Some of the book titles that appear in the law library, such as &quot;Civil, Penal, and Moral Codes&quot;, are legitimate, while others list fellow muralists as authors, in a joking or derogatory manner.

After Diego Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; mural was destroyed by its Rockefeller Center patrons for the inclusion of an image of Lenin, the Coit Tower muralists protested, picketing the tower. Sympathy for Rivera led some artists to incorporate references to the Rivera incident; in Zakheim&#x27;s &quot;Library&quot; panel , Stackpole is painted reading a newspaper headline announcing the destruction of Rivera&#x27;s mural.

===Censorship===
After most of the Coit Tower murals had already been completed, the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike, taking place nearby at the foot of Telegraph Hill, caused government officials, shipping companies, some union leaders and the press to raise fears about communist agitation. This &quot;red scare&quot; has been identified as playing a &quot;crucial role&quot; in a subsequent controversy that mainly focused on two of the murals:
# and : These portraits were linked originally by a third small fresco in which Clifford Wight portrayed capitalism, the New Deal and communism, the three prominent economic systems of the era, with the communism part containing a hammer and sickle and the caption &quot;Workers of the World Unite.&quot;
# : John Langley Howard&#x27;s Industry mural (designed with the support of his architect brother Henry Howard), which depicts California industrial scenes including out-of-work men, and angered conservatives by showing a banner of the communist periodical Western Worker&lt;ref name=&quot;marxists/westernworker&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; above a crowd of workers.

On June 23, 1934, the conservative banker Herbert Fleishhacker, the most powerful member of the committee allocating funds from the Public Works of Art Project, asked Heil to inspect the art, who telegraphed back that some artists had included &quot;details ... and certain symbols which might be interpreted as communistic propaganda,&quot; and that &quot;editors of influential papers ... have warned us that they would take hostile attitude towards whole project unless those details be removed.&quot; The official opening of the tower, planned for July 7, was canceled and Fleishhacker ordered to close the tower and to block the view from outside through the windows. Subsequently, articles in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; attacked the project, sometimes using misleading representations of the artworks in question, while Wight refused to remove the hammer and sickle symbol from his mural. However, federal government officials decided that the offending parts would need to be painted over, and 16 of the artists signed a statement saying that they opposed the hammer and sickle symbol and that it &quot;has no place in the subject matter assigned.&quot; Eventually, only the hammer and sickle and the &quot;Western Worker&quot; banner were removed, and Coit Tower opened on October 12, 1934.

===Technical details and access===
Two of the murals are of San Francisco Bay scenes. Most murals are done in fresco; the exceptions are one mural done in egg tempera (&quot;Home Life&quot; by Jane Berlandina, : upstairs, in the last decorated room) and the works done in the elevator foyer, which are oil on canvas (, , , and ). While most of the murals were restored in 1990 and again in 2014 through cleaning and touching up scratches, the murals in the spiral stairway exit to the observation platform (&quot;Powell Street&quot; by Lucien Labaudt) were not restored but durably painted over with epoxy surfacing.

Most of the murals are open for public viewing without charge during open hours, although there are ongoing negotiations by the Recreation and Parks Department of San Francisco to begin charging visitors a fee to enter the mural rotunda. The murals in the spiral stairway and second floor, normally closed to the public, are open for viewing through tours. Labaudt&#x27;s &quot;Powell Street&quot; runs along both sides of the spiral staircase; the second-floor murals all carry recreational themes.

Since 2004 artist Ben Wood collaborated with other artists on large scale video projections onto the exterior of Coit Tower, in 2004, 2006, 2008 &amp; 2009.

==Panorama==

The tower, which stands atop Telegraph Hill in San Francisco&#x27;s Pioneer Park, offers panoramic views of San Francisco that take in &quot;crooked&quot; Lombard Street, Nob Hill, Russian Hill, Twin Peaks, Aquatic Park, Pier 39, the Financial District and the Ferry Building, as well as San Francisco Bay itself including Angel Island, Alcatraz, Treasure Island, and the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges.

== In popular culture ==

Coit Tower is a prominent landscape feature in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1958 film, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, set largely in San Francisco. The character of Madeleine (Kim Novak) tells Scotty (James Stewart) that she has used the tower to orient herself to his apartment, as she did not know his street address; he responds this is the first time he had been grateful for the tower. Art director Henry Bumstead, who worked on &quot;Vertigo&quot;, noted that Hitchcock was adamant that Coit Tower should be seen in the film from the apartment of the lead character, portrayed by Stewart. When Bumstead asked why, Hitchcock said, &quot;It&#x27;s a phallic symbol.&quot;

<doc id="391014" wikidata="Q431413" url="?curid=391014" title="Svetozar Marović">
<text>Svetozar Marović (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Светозар Маровић; born 31 March 1955) is a Montenegrin lawyer and politician who served as the last head of state and head of government of Serbia and Montenegro from 2003 until Montenegro&#x27;s declaration of independence in 2006.

On 15 December 2015, he was arrested in Montenegro for charges of corruption, and on 18 August 2017, his family&#x27;s assets were frozen. He currently resides in Serbia, where he fled, just before he was found guilty in 2017. Montenegro has repeatedly requested his extradition from Serbia.

In April 2022, Marović was added to the US Treasury&#x27;s Specially Designated Nationals List of individuals facing Balkans-related sanctions.

==Early life==
Svetozar Marović was born on 31 March 1955 in Kotor to Jovo Marović and Ivana Marović (&quot;née&quot; Pavić). His father was a native of the Grbalj region. Marović finished elementary and high school in his hometown, going on to receive his degree from Veljko Vlahović University&#x27;s Faculty of Law in Titograd (now Podgorica).

==Early political career==
Marović began his career as a paralegal in the local parliament of Budva. He served as president of the Socialist Youth Union of Budva, soon becoming president of the Socialist Youth Union of Montenegro. During this time, he attracted controversy for holding an outdoor meeting of the presidency where he spoke up against the old guard of the party, as well as for publishing a brochure titled &quot;Stop Electoral Fraud&quot; in 1984.

He was dismissed from Titograd and went back to Budva, where he became Administrator of Public Revenues, before becoming president of the local government. During this time, he renovated Budva following the earthquake in 1979, starting the Theatre City Budva (&quot;Budva Grad teatar&quot;) project in 1987 with theatre director Ljubiša Ristić.

==Anti-bureaucratic revolution==
In January 1989, Marović seized power over the Socialist Republic of Montenegro together with his partners, Momir Bulatović and Milo Đukanović, in an administrative putsch within the League of Communists of Montenegro. With the blessings of the Serbian Communists&#x27; leader, Slobodan Milošević, it became known as the &quot;anti-bureaucratic revolution&quot;. Marović participated after having stepped down from his position as president of the local government in Budva.

After the first multi-party parliamentary election in 1990, at which the Communist League of Montenegro (SKCG) won the majority, he became a member of Montenegro&#x27;s parliament, and later served as speaker for three terms. A couple of months after their election win, SKCG was repackaged into the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS).

==Split in DPS and crime allegations==
Along with Đukanović and Bulatović, Marović had been a loyal supporter of Slobodan Milošević in all of his policies, but in 1997 he followed Milo Đukanović who broke away from Milošević&#x27;s influence.

In 2001, former Montenegrin president Momir Bulatović released a tell-all memoir named &quot;Pravila ćutanja&quot; (&quot;The Rules of Keeping Silent&quot;), accusing Marović, among many others, of accepting large financial compensation in return for turning a blind eye to widespread oil and tobacco smuggling in Montenegro during the 1990s. Marović and Bulatović are former party colleagues. In addition to former close friendship, they share an intimate bond through the godfather relations between their families.

Despite living in close proximity, as well as sharing many personal and political connections, the two have not spoken to each other in nearly a decade. In the book, Bulatović describes a private conversation during the 1990s in which he confronted Marović about the corruption and quotes his answer: &quot;You see, Momir, you&#x27;re the first ever President of Montenegro, that&#x27;s the legacy you&#x27;re passing on to your children. Me, I want something more concrete to leave my kids with.&quot;

Marović never responded directly to these claims, mentioning only that he hasn&#x27;t read the book. He added that he was taught &quot;the rule of keeping silent about untruth and slander&quot;.

==Presidency 2003–2006==
As President of Serbia and Montenegro&#x27;s loose state union, the position Marović found himself in was complicated. DPS, Marović&#x27;s party, was the leading force of the Montenegrin separatist movement, and his party president, Milo Đukanović, a notable Montenegrin nationalist. It was difficult for Marović to reconcile the views of his administration with his duties as president.

Beginning on 7 March 2003, Marović&#x27;s term in office as President of Serbia-Montenegro involved reconciliation with Croatian and Bosnian citizens. Marović was involved in a military equipment scandal that erupted in September 2005.

===Apologies===
On 10 September 2003, during Croatian president Stjepan Mesić&#x27;s state visit to Belgrade, Marović delivered a public apology for &quot;all evils done by any citizen of Montenegro and Serbia to anyone in Croatia&quot;. Mesić followed suit, delivering a counter-apology to &quot;anyone whom citizens of Croatia caused any pain or damage, anytime, anyplace.&quot;

This was particularly significant because it was in contrast to his views from the beginning of the 1990s when he was the author of an infamous phrase: &quot;war for peace,&quot; which is how he described and justified the Montenegrin reservists&#x27; assault on Dubrovnik and Konavle in 1991.

On 13 November 2003, he visited Sarajevo and issued another apology, this time to the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina on the behalf of Serbia-Montenegro, for &quot;any evil or calamity that anyone in Bosnia-Herzegovina suffered at the hands of anyone from Serbia-Montenegro&quot;. Unlike Stipe Mesić few months prior, Marović&#x27;s Sarajevo hosts, members of Bosnia&#x27;s 3-man rotating Presidency weren&#x27;t moved to reciprocate with any kind of an apology.

===Military equipment scandal===
On 1 September 2005, Serbian Minister of Finance Mlađan Dinkić called a press conference to publicly show a military contract signed by Svetozar Marović. It was a 5-year arrangement between Serbia-Montenegro&#x27;s Council of Ministers and Mile Dragić Company of Zrenjanin, stipulating terms of equipment supply to the Army of Serbia-Montenegro (VSCG) for the period between 2006 and 2011. Dinkić revealed: &quot;Among other things, 69,000 helmets were ordered as well as more than 60,000 body armour suits for an Army that numbers 28,000 people!? Also 500 fighter pilot jackets for a fleet of barely 30 planes!&quot;

While the brunt of the responsibility was leveled at Minister of Defense Prvoslav Davinić, Marović was called out for signing and thus legitimizing such an obviously inflated contract that would end up costing the taxpayers of Serbia €296 million.

After budget commission confirmed Dinkić&#x27;s allegations he went further on 15 September 2005, saying &quot;it&#x27;s completely clear Marović and Davinić were fully in the know about everything that went on&quot; and also implicated several more defense ministry and army officials.

Davinić eventually resigned, the damaging contract was revoked, but Marović fought back in a written release accusing Dinkić of &quot;libel and destroying state union&#x27;s institutions&quot;. The statement continued: &quot;As state union&#x27;s president I&#x27;m responsible for everything. They should not blame anybody, they should not sue anybody, and they should not judge anybody – but me. Because of that, they should submit everything they have against me. But neither to their party investigators, nor to domestic courts they&#x27;re squeezing with their temporary ministerial careers. Let them submit everything they have and more to the best, most experienced, most competent, highest paid and best regarded European and world investigators and courts and they will get an answer – that Svetozar Marović is a clean and honest man.&quot;

Over the next few days, members of Marović&#x27;s cabinet, Montenegrin regime officials, as well as PM Milo Đukanović himself were all threatening to pull all Montenegrin staff from Belgrade.

When the dust somewhat settled, Dinkić announced that &quot;budget inspection met many obstructions within Ministry of Defense during the investigation&quot; but that it&#x27;s determined &quot;to close the issue and put on trial those who are responsible&quot;. Whether those include Davinić and Marović, Dinkić was less clear but agreed that &quot;prosecutor&#x27;s office should go as high up the chain of command as necessary&quot;.

===2006 Montenegrin independence vote===
Marović&#x27;s political party, the DPS, backed full independence for Montenegro, and Marović campaigned for a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the 2006 referendum on Montenegrin independence. This put him in the unique position of supporting the breakup of the state in which he was the head. In the wake of the referendum passing, Marović said that on 1 June 2006, he would &quot;hold the last session of the Council of Ministers and resign...from the post of the president of the state union.&quot;

==Post-presidency==
In 2007, Svetozar was re-elected vice-president of the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro with a new agenda. During the conflicts between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the uncanonical Montenegrin Orthodox Church, Marović stated support of the SOC, being the one recognized. In October 2007, he led the DPS-SDP negotiations team on the table to reach a consensus on the new Montenegrin Constitution. The agreement was that the official language will be called Montenegrin, with both Latin and Cyrillic as official; Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian were recognized. Montenegro will be the state of the Montenegrin people, while Serbs, Bosniaks, Albanians, and Croats will be also mentioned in the Constitution. The Church will be separate from the state, none of them mentioned. Montenegrin citizens will not be able to have dual citizenship, however those who have before the adoption of the Declaration of Independence had multiple citizenships will keep it, effectively leaving the Montenegrins in Serbia unable to hold dual citizenship.

===Arrest and exile===
In 2016, Svetozar Marović, then Deputy President of ruling Democratic Party of Socialists was arrested in connection to a long-running corruption case concerning his hometown of Budva. The Montenegrin prosecutor&#x27;s office labeled him as &quot;head of Budva criminal group,&quot; which he later admitted in court. He eventually fled to neighboring Serbia for alleged psychiatric treatment in Belgrade, where he currently resides. Montenegro has repeatedly requested his extradition from Serbia.

In August 2020, Marović spoke to the media for the first time, after fleeing to Belgrade, accusing the leadership of the party he founded of corruption, nepotism, partocracy and authoritarianism, also accusing President Đukanović of rigging the corruption process against him and members of his family.

He supported Bishop Amfilohije Radović and the 2019–2020 clerical protests in Montenegro, as well endorsing opposition parties at 2020 parliamentary election which resulted in victory for opposition parties.

<text>Iced Earth is an American heavy metal band currently composed of only Jon Schaffer, formed in Tampa, Florida, and based in Columbus, Indiana. They were formed in 1984 under the name the Rose, then Purgatory, by guitarist, main songwriter and bandleader Schaffer and original drummer Greg Seymour. Iced Earth released their debut album in 1990 and have since released twelve studio albums, four EPs, three compilations, three box sets, three live albums and eleven music videos.
After releasing the demo EP &quot;Enter the Realm&quot; (1989) and signing to Century Media Records, the band released two full-length studio albums – &quot;Iced Earth&quot; (1990) and &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot; (1991) – before taking a two-year hiatus from 1992 to 1994, after which the band returned with new lead vocalist Matt Barlow. Iced Earth went on to release four studio albums with him in over half a decade: &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; (1995), &quot;The Dark Saga&quot; (1996), &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; (1998) and &quot;Horror Show&quot; (2001).

After &quot;Horror Show&quot;, Barlow quit the band and joined the police force, while Iced Earth continued on with Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, formerly of Judas Priest, on vocals. With Owens, the band released two studio albums (2004&#x27;s &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot; and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Framing Armageddon&quot;). In late 2007, Barlow rejoined the band, and they recorded one more album with him: &quot;The Crucible of Man&quot; (2008). In 2011, Barlow once again left Iced Earth, and was replaced by Into Eternity frontman Stu Block. &quot;Dystopia&quot;, Block&#x27;s first album with the group, was released that October; the album received a positive response, with some critics calling it one of Iced Earth&#x27;s best albums. The group recorded two more albums with Block: &quot;Plagues of Babylon&quot; (2014) and &quot;Incorruptible&quot; (2017).

Iced Earth has had numerous lineup changes; as of 2021, there had been over thirty musicians in and out of the band since its formation, with Schaffer as the sole constant member. Following Schaffer&#x27;s January 2021 arrest by the FBI for his involvement in the 2021 United States Capitol attack, the rest of the lineup departed, and the band was dropped from their longtime label Century Media. Schaffer was sentenced to three years probation in 2024, and later pardoned by President Donald Trump in January 2025.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1984–1989)===

The central figure of Iced Earth is, and has been, guitarist Jon Schaffer, who formed the band on January 20, 1985, in Tampa, Florida. Schaffer&#x27;s original vision for the band started under the moniker &quot;The Rose&quot; in 1984.

The group was short-lived, after which Schaffer formed a band called Purgatory, which would eventually change its name to Iced Earth. Line-up changes were common within the band, with Schaffer staying as the only constant member. The group recorded a demo in 1985, titled &quot;Psychotic Dreams&quot;. In 1988, Purgatory changed its name to Iced Earth. According to Schaffer, a friend of his, who died in a motorcycle accident prior to Schaffer moving to Florida was responsible for the name. In 1989, Iced Earth recorded another demo called &quot;Enter the Realm&quot;, with the lineup of Gene Adam on vocals, Randall Shawver on lead guitar, Dave Abell on bass, Greg Seymour on drums and Schaffer on rhythm guitar and vocals. All of the songs on &quot;Enter the Realm&quot; would later appear on the band&#x27;s debut album, with the exception of &quot;Nightmares&quot; and the title track.

=== Self-titled debut album and &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot; (1990–1993) ===

After getting signed to Century Media Records, the band, now with Mike McGill on drums, started work on their debut album. Recorded at Morrisound Recording, with Tom Morris and Schaffer as producers, &quot;Iced Earth&quot; was released in November 1990 in Europe and on February 25, 1991, in the US. Following the album&#x27;s release, Iced Earth toured across Europe with Blind Guardian.

Following their self-titled debut, Iced Earth quickly began work on their second album. Prior to the recording process, singer Gene Adam was let go from the band after he refused to take singing lessons. Adam was subsequently replaced by John Greely, as was drummer McGill by Richey Secchiari. The album, entitled &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot;, was again recorded at Morrisound Recording, with Schaffer and Morris as producers. The album was released on November 11, 1991, in Europe, but in the US, the album&#x27;s release was delayed until April 1992, so it wouldn&#x27;t compete with the group&#x27;s debut album. Following &quot;Night of the Stormrider&#x27;s&quot; release, Iced Earth again toured Europe with Blind Guardian.

===&quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; and &quot;The Dark Saga&quot; (1994–1997)===

Following the supporting tour for &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot;, Iced Earth entered a two-year hiatus from 1992 to 1994. During this downtime, the band was faced with issues that almost resulted in them breaking up, but eventually Iced Earth resurfaced with &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;. Heralded as Iced Earth&#x27;s heaviest album, &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; was released on April 14, 1995, and was the band&#x27;s first album to feature drummer Rodney Beasley and vocalist Matthew Barlow.
In January 1996, Iced Earth began recording their fourth studio album, this time with Tom Morris&#x27; brother Jim Morris acting as co-producer, along with Schaffer. The album was also the first to feature drummer Mark Prator, and the last to feature longtime bassist Dave Abell, who left the group after finishing recording. Although Abell was credited for playing on the album, bassist Keith Menser appears on the back cover, because Century Media demanded the touring lineup to appear on the cover. Menser was fired after he didn&#x27;t learn any of the band&#x27;s songs for the tour, so he was soon replaced by James MacDonough. Mark Prator was also let go from the band, and was subsequently replaced by Brent Smedley. Released on May 23, 1996, &quot;The Dark Saga&quot; was a concept album based on the comic book character Spawn. Musically the album was much more melodic and simplified compared to previous Iced Earth albums. For the supporting tour, Iced Earth was joined by Nevermore.

On April 21, 1997, Iced Earth released their first compilation album: &quot;Days of Purgatory&quot;. The album featured songs from their first two albums, as well as the &quot;Enter the Realm&quot; demo, resung by Matt Barlow, with new drums and bass on some tracks as well. The album also featured a few songs from &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;, remixed and remastered.

===&quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; and &quot;Alive in Athens&quot; (1998–1999)===

In March 1998, work began on the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, with Jim Morris returning as the producer. Prior to the recording process, long-time guitarist Randall Shawver left the group. Guitarist Larry Tarnowski handled lead guitar duties on the album, but wasn&#x27;t credited as a full-time member of the band, but as a session musician. Brent Smedley was also unable to play on the album for personal reasons and was temporarily replaced by Mark Prator, whom Smedley had originally replaced in 1996. Released on June 17, 1998, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; was notable for featuring the debut of Schaffer&#x27;s Something Wicked Saga, which he would expand upon on future albums. While on the supporting tour for &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; (with Brent Smedley back on drums), the band recorded their first live album in Athens, Greece on January 23 and 24, 1999. Entitled &quot;Alive in Athens&quot;, the three CD set was recorded in front of a sold-out audience (both nights) at the Rodon Club. The album was released on July 19, 1999.

Also in 1999, the band released &quot;The Melancholy E.P.&quot;. Originally conceived as a radio-only single, the EP contained three previously released songs (&quot;Melancholy (Holy Martyr)&quot;, &quot;Watching Over Me&quot; and &quot;I Died for You&quot;), as well as two new ones (cover versions of Bad Company&#x27;s &quot;Shooting Star&quot; and Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Electric Funeral&quot;). However, Century Media Records did not end-up releasing the EP, so it was made available for fans as a limited 1500-copy special release.

===&quot;Horror Show&quot; and &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot; (2000–2004)===
In 2000, work began on Iced Earth&#x27;s sixth studio album. Entitled &quot;Horror Show&quot;, the album contained songs based on horror films and literature, such as &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; and the &quot;Wolf Man&quot;. Released on June 26, 2001, the album was the band&#x27;s first to feature drummer Richard Christy, and the third with guitarist Larry Tarnowski (now a full-time member). Originally Steve di Giorgio played bass on the album, but left the group after the recording process. According to Schaffer, Di Giorgio was required and agreed to go on tour, but left due to &quot;prior commitments&quot;. He was replaced by James MacDonough. &quot;Horror Show&quot; was also the first Iced Earth album to be partially recorded at Schaffer&#x27;s home studio &quot;Schaffer Sound&quot;.

On November 26, 2001 (March 5, 2002, in America) the band released the boxset &quot;Dark Genesis&quot;, which featured the band&#x27;s first three albums plus the &quot;Enter the Realm&quot; -demo, remastered and remixed with new cover art. The set also featured a new album, entitled &quot;Tribute to the Gods&quot;. It was Iced Earth&#x27;s seventh studio album, featuring songs from such bands as Iron Maiden, Kiss and Blue Öyster Cult.

After the events of 9/11, Matt Barlow came to the conclusion that he wanted to start contributing to the &quot;real world&quot;. Barlow approached Schaffer with this in late 2002, but Schaffer convinced Barlow to stay with the band. When Iced Earth began recording their next studio album, Schaffer realized that Barlow&#x27;s vocals were not what he desired; he felt that they lacked passion and quality, so he decided to let Barlow go after all. Barlow became a police officer in the Georgetown Police Dept. in Georgetown, Delaware.

After Barlow&#x27;s departure, Iced Earth continued work on their next album, and eventually Schaffer got Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, from Judas Priest, to sing on the record as a favor. Owens, who was still in Judas Priest at the time, was originally supposed to be credited as a guest musician, but after singer Rob Halford rejoined Judas Priest, Owens joined Iced Earth full-time. Prior to the recording process, Tarnowski was let go from the band, so the lead guitar parts on the album were played by producer Jim Morris and session guitarist Ralph Santolla.

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Iced Earth released &quot;The Reckoning&quot;. The single contained four songs off the new album, that the band felt were most likely to get radio airplay. &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot; was released on January 12, 2004, in Europe and on January 13, in the United States. Much like how &quot;Horror Show&quot; was based on horror films and literature, &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot; was inspired by historical events. It was also the band&#x27;s first album with their new record company SPV. Following the supporting tour, James MacDonough left Iced Earth to join Megadeth.

===&quot;Framing Armageddon&quot; and &quot;The Crucible of Man&quot; (2005–2010)===

After &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot;, work began on the group&#x27;s next album, which would be an expanded concept album on the &quot;Something Wicked&quot; storyline from &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;. Before starting work on the album, Iced Earth was faced with multiple lineup changes. In July 2006, Ernie Carletti was chosen as the group&#x27;s new lead guitar player, but after being faced with rape and kidnapping charges, he was replaced by Tim Mills. Incidentally, Mills was also forced to leave Iced Earth in order to concentrate on his own business, &quot;Bare Knuckle Pickups&quot;. In October 2006, Brent Smedley rejoined Iced Earth again, replacing Richard Christy on the drums. Because the band were left without a bassist and lead guitar player, Schaffer ended up performing most of the lead guitar and bass parts on the album (although some tracks featured playing from producer Jim Morris, guitarist Troy Seele and bassist Dennis Hayes) In May 2007, Seele was announced as a permanent member of the band, as was Dennis Hayes two months earlier.

Before releasing the full-length album, Iced Earth released the EP &quot;Overture of the Wicked&quot;, which featured re-recorded versions of the original &quot;Something Wicked Trilogy&quot; as well as a brand new track, entitled &quot;Ten Thousand Strong&quot;. &quot;Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1&quot; was released on September 7, 2007, in Germany, September 10, in the rest of Europe, and on September 11, in the United States.

In December 2007, it was announced that Barlow would be rejoining Iced Earth after five years. Following his return, work continued on Iced Earth&#x27;s next album, originally titled &quot;Revelation Abomination: Something Wicked Part 2&quot;. Majority of the album&#x27;s music had been recorded at the same time as &quot;Framing Armageddon&quot;, and originally Schaffer had planned to finish the album after the end of 2007. However work on the album had to be pushed back, due to Barlow&#x27;s prior commitments to his other band, Pyramaze. In early 2008, it was announced that Dennis Hayes had been replaced by bassist Freddie Vidales.

Before releasing their next full-length album, Iced Earth released the single &quot;I Walk Among You&quot; which contained a new song from the forthcoming album, as well as two song from &quot;Framing Armageddon&quot;, resung by Barlow. After being retitled &quot;The Crucible of Man: Something Wicked Part 2,&quot; Iced Earth&#x27;s tenth studio album was released in September 2008. After &quot;The Crucible of Man&quot;, the band released &quot;Box of the Wicked&quot;, in early 2010. The boxset contained &quot;Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1&quot;, &quot;The Crucible Of Man: Something Wicked Part 2&quot;, the &quot;Overture of the Wicked&quot; EP and the &quot;I Walk Among You&quot; single, as well as a bonus CD, containing one song from &quot;Framing Armageddon&quot;, now with Barlow on lead vocals, as well as three previously unreleased live tracks from the Graspop Metal Meeting festival in 2008. The boxset also included a poster and a booklet. Also in early 2010, Iced Earth signed a new contract with their former record company, Century Media Records.

===&quot;Dystopia&quot; (2011–2012)===
In March 2011, Barlow issued a statement on Iced Earth&#x27;s official website, stating that he was retiring from the band due to family commitments, among other things. Barlow still took part in the band&#x27;s 2011 summer tour, and played his final show with Iced Earth on August 6, 2011, at the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany. Shortly after announcing Barlow&#x27;s departure, Iced Earth revealed that Into Eternity frontman Stu Block had been chosen as the band&#x27;s new lead vocalist. With Block now on board, Iced Earth began recording their next studio album in May 2011.

On June 27, 2011, the band released the DVD &quot;Festivals of the Wicked&quot;, which featured shows from Metal Camp Open Air (2008), the Rock Hard Festival (2008) and Wacken Open Air (2007). On September 7, 2011, Iced Earth released a re-recorded version of the song &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;, from the album &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;. The band&#x27;s new album &quot;Dystopia&quot; was released on October 17, 2011, in Europe and October 18 in the United States. While not a concept album, many of the album&#x27;s songs were inspired by dystopian themes and films such as &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, &quot;Dark City&quot; and &quot;Equilibrium&quot;. Two songs (&quot;Dystopia&quot; and &quot;Tragedy and Triumph&quot;) also featured the return of the &quot;Something Wicked&quot; storyline. After the &quot;Dystopia&quot;″s release, Iced Earth kicked off the Dystopia World Tour, which was heralded as &quot;the most extensive world tour Iced Earth has ever undertaken&quot; and that it would take the band &quot;to countries it has never previously played&quot;.

On April 10, 2012, it was announced that Freddie Vidales had left Iced Earth. He was subsequently replaced by Luke Appleton from Fury UK. On August 19, 2012, Iced Earth recorded a new live CD/DVD in Cyprus, entitled &quot;Live in Ancient Kourion&quot;.

===&quot;Plagues of Babylon&quot; and &quot;Incorruptible&quot; (2013–2020)===

Iced Earth began writing new material for their twelfth studio album in early 2013. Drummer Smedley left the band in May 2013 for personal reasons. Raphael Saini therefore played drums on the album, titled &quot;Plagues of Babylon&quot;, as well as filling in on tour until Jon Dette took over on drums in November 2013. The album was released in January 2014, reaching position #5 on the German Media Control Charts, which is band&#x27;s highest chart position in their entire career.

On April 7, 2015, following a period of inactivity as a result of Schaffer requiring cervical fusion surgery, the band announced that Iced Earth would begin writing for their 13th studio album. The announcement also revealed that drummer Smedley had rejoined the band, replacing Dette, and that the new album was to be tentatively titled &quot;The Judas Goat&quot;, with an expected release date and subsequent touring cycle in early 2016. In August 2016 lead guitarist Troy Seele announced his departure from the band citing family reasons. He was replaced on September 25, 2016, by Jake Dreyer.

On December 6, 2016, Schaffer spoke in an interview with Fernando Bonenfant from Metal Wani and announced that the new album would be called &quot;Incorruptible&quot;, originally due for release in May 2017. On March 13, 2017, the band confirmed that they had completed work on the album for a mid-June release. On April 6, the artwork was revealed with the album being set for a June 16 release. The release of the album also fulfilled the band&#x27;s second deal with Century Media Records.

On October 26, 2018, it was revealed that Jon Schaffer had recruited previous Iced Earth members Gene Adam (vocals) and Bill Owen (lead guitar); along with guests Jim Morris (lead guitar), Ruben Drake (bass guitar), and Mark Prator (drums); to form &quot;Jon Schaffer&#x27;s Purgatory&quot;, taking the name from the precursor to Iced Earth. The band had re-recorded old pre-Iced Earth demos, including (in their original form) tracks that were later re-recorded for Iced Earth releases. This EP, titled &quot;Purgatory&quot;, was released in December 2018.

Iced Earth&#x27;s 1989 demo &quot;Enter the Realm&quot; was released on CD and vinyl for the first time on April 12, 2019, exactly 30 years after its original release.

In a Facebook Live chat that took place on April 14, 2020, Schaffer confirmed that, after &quot;a little bit of time off&quot;, Iced Earth would start working on their thirteenth studio album for a spring 2021 release. He stated: &quot;Everything is a little bit up in the air right now. Even working on a new Iced Earth album is gonna be challenging until we see how all this plays out, because it&#x27;s an international band. Stu&#x27;s in Canada and Luke is in the U.K., so that makes it even more difficult for travel…the biggest issue now is logistics of actually getting together to do it, because we&#x27;re an international band. If we lived in the same town or even in the same country, it would make things a lot easier. But we will [get around to making a new album], and there will be a time for that, no doubt. To say when that&#x27;s gonna be, my plan was to focus on it in the back half of this year and have a release in spring of 2021. But the world&#x27;s flipped upside down and has gotten pretty weird lately.&quot;

===Hiatus since Schaffer&#x27;s arrest (2021–present)===
In early January 2021, Schaffer appeared on the Most Wanted section of the FBI after being photographed taking part of the 2021 United States Capitol attack. On January 9, Block posted a message via his personal Instagram account on behalf of the rest of the band members regarding Schaffer&#x27;s situation:

&quot;Some of you have been concerned by our silence, which we understand. We needed some time to properly process the information and find out some facts before we made a statement. First and foremost we absolutely DO NOT condone nor do we support riots or the acts of violence that the rioters were involved in on January 6th at the US Capitol building. We hope that all those involved that day are brought to justice to be investigated and answer for their actions.&quot; On January 17, it was announced that Schaffer was in FBI custody, on six felony charges, after turning himself in to authorities. Iced Earth and Demons &amp; Wizards were both later dropped from Century Media due to these events. On February 15, 2021, vocalist Stu Block and bassist Luke Appleton both announced their resignation from the band as a result of the event. On the same day, Jake Dreyer also announced his departure, stating that he would be focusing on his band Witherfall. By 2024, Smedley had also left.

Schaffer entered a guilty plea of unlawfully entering Congress and obstructing an official proceeding, on April 16, 2021, and was granted sponsorship for United States Federal Witness Protection Program. Schaffer was eventually sentenced to three years probation.

A compilation album &quot;A Narrative Soundscape&quot; was released in January 2022 as a companion of Schaffer&#x27;s lyrics anthology &quot;Wicked Words and Epic Tales&quot;. It features 15 songs of the band in &quot;stripped&quot; acoustic-ambient versions and with spoken lyrics.

==Musical style and lyrical themes==

Iced Earth has been described as power metal, heavy metal, and thrash metal. When asked about the band&#x27;s musical style, Schaffer, Iced Earth&#x27;s chief songwriter, said: &quot;We&#x27;re a metal band. That&#x27;s what we are. We have every dynamic from Pink Floyd to Slayer and everything in between.&quot; In a 2019 interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, he said, &quot;I think that a lot of power-metal stuff is kind of cheesy, actually. This is just something that I&#x27;m not into.&quot;

Iced Earth&#x27;s music has evolved and shifted several times during the band&#x27;s history. On the group&#x27;s 1990 self-titled debut album, the band&#x27;s sound was characterized by time changes, acoustic passages and Iron Maiden-type galloping rhythms. Many of these elements carried over to the follow-up album &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot;, which added keyboards and piano, as well as some choral arrangements. 1995&#x27;s &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; has been heralded as Iced Earth&#x27;s heaviest album, and included the band&#x27;s longest song to date, &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;. As a counter measure to &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;, 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Saga&quot; featured a much more subdued sound compared to previous releases. The focus was less on technical musicianship, but on emotion and melody. &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; combined elements found on previous albums with brand new ideas. The &quot;Something Wicked Trilogy&quot;, which closes the album, took many cues from the &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot; album. Iced Earth continued to expand their sound throughout the 2000s, like adding a full-piece orchestra to the song &quot;Gettysburg&quot; from 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot;.

Common lyrical themes in Iced Earth&#x27;s music have been religion, history, fantasy, literature, and films. The band has also released several concept albums, the first being 1991&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot;. The second, 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Saga&quot;, was based on the Todd McFarlane comic book character Spawn. 1998&#x27;s &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; introduced the Something Wicked Saga, which was later expanded upon on 2007&#x27;s &quot;Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1&quot;, and 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible of Man: Something Wicked Part 2&quot;. Iced Earth have also released several albums written around a theme. 2001&#x27;s &quot;Horror Show&quot; was largely based on horror literature and films, 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot; was inspired by history and war, while 2011&#x27;s &quot;Dystopia&quot; centered around dystopian themes in literature and film.

<text>Dmitri Anatolyevich Afanasenkov (; born May 12, 1980) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Philadelphia Flyers.

==Playing career==
Afanasenkov began his North American ice hockey career after being drafted by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft in the third round, 72nd overall. He started playing in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the Moncton Wildcats in his first season, and then for the Sherbrooke Castors in the 1999–2000 and 2000–01 seasons.

Following the 2000–01 season, he was signed by the Lightning. Until the 2003–04 NHL season, he would split his time between the Lightning and their farm team. He would play for one IHL team (the Detroit Vipers) and two AHL teams (the Grand Rapids Griffins and Springfield Falcons).

During the 2003–04 NHL season, his rookie season, he scored six goals and ten assists during the regular season and three points during the Lightning&#x27;s post season run to the 2004 Stanley Cup.

Following the lockout, he returned to the Lightning, but with the presence of Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis, and Brad Richards, he had limited playing time. He did not put up the numbers he could, and so, on December 30, 2006, the Lightning waived him and he was picked up by the Philadelphia Flyers. While in Philadelphia, Afanasenkov picked up the nickname &quot;The Shark&quot;, scoring 15 points (8 goals, 7 assists) in 41 games with the Flyers. A pending restricted free agent, he was not tendered a qualifying offer and became an unrestricted free agent. He signed with Dynamo Moscow on August 1, 2007 and signed on 26 September 2009 for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl.

<text>Sirenidae, the sirens, are a family of neotenic aquatic salamanders. Family members have very small fore limbs and lack hind limbs altogether. In one species, the skeleton in their fore limbs is made of only cartilage. In contrast to most other salamanders, they have external gills bunched together on the neck in both larval and adult states. Sirens are found only in the Southeastern United States and northern Mexico.

Although they are primarily carnivorous, they are the only salamanders observed eating plant material.

==Description==
Sirens are quite distinct from other salamanders, and in some classifications they form their own suborder, Sirenoidea, or as a completely distinct order (Meantes or Trachystomata). Genetic analysis variously places them as the sister to other Salamandroidea or as sister to all other salamanders. Many of their unique characteristics seem to be partly primitive and partly derivative.

Sirens are generally eel-like in form, with two tiny, but otherwise fully developed, fore limbs. They range from in length. They are neotenic, although the larval gills are small and functionless at first, and only adults have fully developed (but inefficient) gills. They are obligate air-breathers with well developed lungs. Proving they likely evolved from a terrestrial ancestor with an aquatic larval stage. Like amphiumas, they are able to cross land on rainy nights.

These amphibians are omnivorous, feeding mainly on worms, small snails, shrimps, and filamentous algae. They are notable among salamanders (and most amphibians, aside from a few frog species) due to their semi-herbivorous habits. Their jaws possess sharp-edged keratinised and toothless ridges, like many anuran tadpoles, but the coronoid bone in the lower jaw and the vomer and palatine bone in the upper jaw have patches of monocuspid and unbladed teeth arranged in patterns.

If the conditions of a water source are unsuitable, a larva will shrink its gills to mere stumps, and these may not function at all. They are also able to burrow into mud of drying ponds and encase themselves with a cocoon of mucus to survive periods of drought. During such periods, they breathe with their small but functional lungs.

Unlike other salamanders, an interventricular septum is present in the heart. At least two of the species can produce vocalizations.

The structure of sirens&#x27; reproductive systems suggests they employ external fertilization. This has finally been confirmed in captive breeding experiments, showcasing that males also engage in parental care, building nests for their offspring. Parental care among sirens is paternal due to external fertilization. In &quot;S. intermedia&quot; males circle around females and may rub or bite her flank region. Both male and female will go on their backs and turn. It is assumed here where the female spawns and the male fertilizes her eggs. After the courtship is over, the female leaves and the male guards the eggs. Males could potentially guard more than one brood, but they are known to bite females who enter a nesting site. Paternal care has also been observed in Cryptobranchoidea, the other suborder with external fertilization. This is critical to phylogeny, as Salamandroidea, the third suborder, use internal fertilization which may be pair with maternal care, meaning that sirens are one of the oldest groups of salamanders.

The combined biomass of &quot;Siren intermedia&quot; species in a Texas pond exceeded the total biomass of the pond&#x27;s seven species of fish.

<text>Nicole Camille Richie (; born September 21, 1981) is an American media personality, fashion designer, and actress. She came to prominence after appearing on the reality television series &quot;The Simple Life&quot; (2003–2007), in which she starred alongside her friend and fellow socialite Paris Hilton. Richie&#x27;s personal life attracted media attention during the series&#x27; five-year run and thereafter.

Following the conclusion of &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, Richie continued her career in television, appearing as one of the three judges on the reality competition series &quot;Fashion Star&quot; (2012–2013). She later starred in the unscripted comedy series &quot;Candidly Nicole&quot; (2014–2015), which ran for two seasons. From 2017 to 2018, Richie starred in her first series regular acting role as Portia Scott-Griffith in the sitcom &quot;Great News&quot;. In 2020, she became a judge on the reality competition series &quot;Making the Cut&quot;. In fashion, Richie is the founder of the lifestyle brand House of Harlow. Richie has also published two novels.

==Early life, family and education==
Nicole Camille Escovedo was born in Berkeley, California. She is of English, Mexican, and Creole African-American descent. Her biological father, Peter Michael Escovedo, is the brother of musician Sheila E. and nephew of guitarist Alejandro Escovedo, and her biological mother is Karen Moss. When she was three years old, her biological parents decided to leave her under the care of Lionel Richie and his first wife Brenda Harvey Richie&#x27;s family because they could not afford to provide for her. Lionel and Brenda Harvey Richie became her guardians. His 1986 hit song &quot;Ballerina Girl&quot; was written about Nicole.

Brenda Harvey and Lionel Richie legally adopted Nicole when she was nine years old. When Lionel and Brenda went through a bitter public split, they were indulgent to the young Nicole. &quot;Their way of making me happy was to say, &#x27;yes,&#x27; to everything I wanted, but I don&#x27;t think a little girl should have that much freedom,&quot; said Richie in a 2006 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Following the divorce, Lionel remarried and had two more children: Miles (b. 1994) and Sofia (b. 1998). Richie&#x27;s godmother is Nancy Davis, daughter of Marvin Davis and mother of Brandon Davis. Richie regularly interacted with musicians her father knew, including Michael Jackson (who was her godfather), Prince and Kenny Rogers. Quincy Jones said in a &quot;People&quot; magazine interview that he has &quot;known Nicole Richie since she was a baby. She&#x27;s a very smart girl&quot;.

Richie graduated from Montclair College Preparatory School in 1999, then attended the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, alongside Kourtney Kardashian and Luke Walton, where she studied Arts and Media. She did not have a definitive study plan in Arizona, dropped out after two years, and returned to California.

==Career==

===Television===

In 2003, Richie and her best friend, Paris Hilton, starred in the reality series &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, in which they lived for a month with a family in the rural community of Altus, Arkansas. The series premiere debuted on Fox on December 2, 2003, to 13 million viewers, increasing Fox&#x27;s reach among viewers 18–49. The series continued for a second and third season.

Fox subsequently canceled the show after a dispute between Hilton and Richie, but it was aired by E! Entertainment Television for its fourth season, drawing nearly one million viewers and was followed by a relatively unsuccessful fifth season. Complications arose during production of the fifth season, with both Richie and Hilton facing major charges for DUI, and at risk of serving jail time. Hilton was sentenced to 23 days in jail, though this was after production of the season had finished. Richie accepted a plea agreement and was sentenced to four days in jail, again after production had wrapped. Despite talks of a sixth season, the series finished its run at the end of the moderately unsuccessful fifth season.

In 2005, Richie made her acting debut in the comedy film &quot;Kids in America&quot;. Richie has guest starred in television series including &quot;Eve&quot;, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;American Dreams&quot;, &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot;, and &quot;Chuck&quot;. Richie appeared as a guest judge during the premiere episode of the seventh season of the reality competition series &quot;Project Runway&quot;. From 2012 to 2013, she judged the reality competition series &quot;Fashion Star&quot;. From 2014 to 2015, Richie starred in the unscripted comedy series &quot;Candidly Nicole&quot;. It is loosely based on Richie&#x27;s posts on Twitter.

In 2016, Richie was cast as Portia Scott-Griffith, a news anchor, in the sitcom &quot;Great News&quot;, created by Tracey Wigfield and produced by Wigfield and Tina Fey. The acting role marked Richie&#x27;s first as a regular on a television series. When speaking about Richie&#x27;s casting, Fey stated that she was &quot;a really funny person&quot; with &quot;an instant likability&quot; and &quot;good timing without really pushing it.&quot; The series premiered on NBC in April 2017. Sonia Saraiya of &quot;Variety&quot; called Richie&#x27;s performance &quot;a turn that reveals her substantial comedic talents&quot;, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Emily Yahr highlighted how she &quot;artfully delivers her many one-liners&quot;. The series concluded in 2018 after two seasons.

In 2020, she created, executive produced, and starred in digital platform Quibi&#x27;s series &quot;Nikki Fre$h&quot;, which chronicles the career of Richie&#x27;s rapper alter ego of the same name. That same year, she appeared as a judge in the reality competition series &quot;Making the Cut&quot;.

===Writing===

In 2005, Richie wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;The Truth About Diamonds&quot;, which was released by Bharell Jackson Publishing. The novel is loosely based on her life but is mostly fictional. It chronicles the life of a famous singer&#x27;s adopted daughter named Chloe Parker, who makes her way through all the popular nightclubs and parties in Hollywood while battling a drug addiction. In early January 2006, &quot;The Truth About Diamonds&quot; peaked at number No. 32 in Hardcover Fiction on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best-Seller List.

Richie&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Priceless&quot;, was released on September 28, 2010. It tells the story of a girl who loses everything and then learns about what really matters in life.

===Fashion===

Richie has been featured in several fashion blogs and magazines such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;InStyle&quot;, &quot;Paper&quot;, &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;Nylon&quot;, &quot;Tatler&quot;, &quot;Flare&quot;, and &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;. She has also modeled for Australia&#x27;s &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Elle;&quot; US&#x27; &quot;People, Stuff, Blender and Hollywood Reporter;&quot; Mexico&#x27;s &quot;Marie Claire&quot; and UK&#x27;s &quot;Glamour.&quot; Richie has been the face of Bongo Jeans and Jimmy Choo advertising campaigns. In April 2007, Richie announced plans to start a jewelry, accessories, and sunglasses line along with a perfume and style book. In October 2008, she debuted a jewelry line, named House of Harlow. The line became available at Kitson&#x27;s online boutique. In spring 2010, the line was extended to include apparel and shoes. House of Harlow later became a lifestyle brand including eyewear, home fragrance, and accessories.

In 2009, Richie joined maternity store A Pea in the Pod to create the new collection maternity clothes. The line was titled &quot;Nicole&quot; which had pieces that she would wear as an expectant mother. In February 2010, Richie expanded her fashion business with a women&#x27;s line called Winter Kate, her daughter&#x27;s two middle names. The collection was inspired by timeless prints and shapes, beautiful paisley and florals.

In 2010, Richie won &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; for her House of Harlow brand at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards. House of Harlow was also nominated in the category &quot;Celebrity Fashion Line&quot; at the 2010 Teen Choice Awards. In July 2011, the brand unveiled a 14-piece handbag collection, which became available at Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, and Shopbop. In May 2012, it was reported both Ritchie&#x27;s lines, House of Harlow 1960 and Winter Kate reached estimated sales of $55 million combined while Richie only receives 5% of revenues, according to the Hollywood Reporter. She launched a collection for Macy&#x27;s Impulse line in September 2012, which was sold in 100 Macy&#x27;s stores as well as online. Her first fragrance, Nicole by Nicole Richie, was also launched in September 2012. Her second fragrance, No Rules by Nicole Richie was launched in March 2014.

In 2017, Richie became Urban Decay&#x27;s brand ambassador, representing their &quot;Troublemaker&quot; mascara. House of Harlow partnered with Urban Decay for a limited-edition collection in April 2018. The line was exclusively sold at Revolve&#x27;s official website.

===Music===
Richie made her musical debut in February 2005 with a live appearance on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The View&quot; playing the piano. In 2004, she auditioned for the role of Maureen in the popular Broadway hit &quot;Rent&quot; but did not get the part. In February 2010, Richie was featured on the charity single &quot;We Are the World 25 for Haiti&quot;. In September 2013, Richie made a cameo appearance in Christina Aguilera&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Let There Be Love&quot;.

Richie stated in April 2020 that she would release a comedy rap album under the moniker Nikki Fre$h; confirmed songs for the album include &quot;Drip Drip&quot;, &quot;The Gem Song&quot;, and &quot;Bee&#x27;s Tea&quot;. The album, titled &quot;Unearthed&quot;, was released on August 28.

===Philanthropy===
In November 2007, Richie and her husband Joel Madden created The Richie Madden Children&#x27;s Foundation in support of disadvantaged young mothers and children. She has been involved with the Red Cross, UNICEF, Elton John AIDS Foundation, Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, March of Dimes, Playing for Change, Small Steps Project, and Baby2Baby. Richie is a board member of Baby2Baby.

In 2007, Richie and Madden donated 100 baby gifts to expectant mothers at Los Angeles Free Clinic, through The Richie Madden Children&#x27;s Foundation. In May 2008, Richie and Madden shot a UNICEF public-service announcement to generate aid for the cyclone-devastated Myanmar. Richie and Madden have also written blogs on the UNICEF website and encouraged people to help children in need. Richie, Joel and Benji Madden along with UNICEF held a fundraiser for the Tap Project in March 2009. They sold 143 water pumps to bring water directly to the villages and raised $100,000. Esprit donated 10% of all the sales on April 2, 2009, at their newly opened 3rd Street Promenade store to The Richie-Madden Children&#x27;s Foundation. The Richie-Madden Foundation specially designed &quot;Cup with a Cause&quot; for 7-Eleven. It was a part of their charity-focused coffee campaign in February 2010. During 2010 the Foundation worked together with Beyond Shelter, a non-profit organization devoted to providing shelter for homeless families in Los Angeles.

Richie has been a board member of the Environmental Media Association for several years and took part in their awareness program in May 2009. Each member &quot;adopted&quot; a school to raise awareness for the program and help students with environmental education. She also participated in a charity hand-me-downs auction that started on the website handmedowns.com. The proceeds went directly to The Richie Madden Children&#x27;s Foundation to help bring more opportunities to children in the US and abroad.

In November 2011, Richie hosted Baby2Baby&#x27;s charity event to support families in need during holiday season. She was a guest speaker at WE Charity&#x27;s WE Day California event in 2018.

==Personal life==

In April 2005, reports surfaced that Richie and longtime friend Paris Hilton were no longer speaking to each other. Hilton commented: &quot;It&#x27;s no big secret that Nicole and I are no longer friends. Nicole knows what she did, and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m ever going to say about it&quot;. Neither Richie nor Hilton spoke publicly about the cause of the split. They eventually reconciled in October 2006. 

Richie was briefly engaged to DJ Adam Goldstein, whom she dated from 2004 to 2006.

In December 2006, she began dating singer Joel Madden of rock group Good Charlotte. They have two children, a daughter born in January 2008 and a son born in September 2009. In February 2008, the first photos of their daughter were sold to &quot;People&quot; magazine for $1 million. The couple confirmed their engagement in February 2010 and married on December 11, 2010. They reside in Los Angeles, California.

===Health===
In early 2006, Richie was notably thinner compared with her previous appearance in the first two seasons of &quot;The Simple Life&quot;. In May, she told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;I know I&#x27;m too thin right now, so I wouldn&#x27;t want any young girl looking at me and saying, &#x27;That&#x27;s what I want to look like.&#x27; She also said, &quot;I started seeing a nutritionist and a doctor. I was scared that it could be something more serious.&quot; During this time, it was reported that she had also sought the help of a psychiatrist and a personal trainer. Later that year, in September, Richie stated &quot;I am not anorexic. I am not bulimic. I do not have an eating disorder.&quot; On October 27, 2006, it was announced that Richie was seeking treatment for &quot;an inability to put on weight&quot;, though it was not for an eating disorder.

In March 2007, Richie was taken to the hospital for dehydration. On March 21, her representatives announced she suffered from hypoglycemia.

===Legal issues===
In October 2002, Richie was arrested following a brawl in a New York City nightclub. The charges were dropped. In February 2003, she checked herself into a rehabilitation center following her arrest in Malibu, California for driving with a revoked license and possession of heroin. In August, she was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation.

On December 11, 2006, Richie was arrested by the California Highway Patrol after she failed a field sobriety test. She was charged with driving under the influence on State Route 134 in the Burbank/Glendale, California area. Several motorists had reported a black Mercedes-Benz G-Class entering the freeway on the exit ramp and traveling in the opposite traffic direction. She admitted to using marijuana and the narcotic Vicodin before the incident. On July 27, 2007, Richie was sentenced to four days in jail at the Century Regional Detention Center in Lynwood, California. However, she only served about 82 minutes of the sentence and was released at 16:37 PDT on August 23, 2007. A spokeswoman for the sheriff&#x27;s department told &quot;People&quot; magazine that Richie &quot;was released early due to overcrowding in the jail system.&quot; Richie enrolled in an 18-month anti-drinking driver education program the following month, according to papers filed with the Superior Court of California.

In June 2010, Richie&#x27;s probation was extended one year to March 2011 because she missed her anti-drunk driving class. However, Richie&#x27;s probation was terminated early in December 2010, after her lawyer presented details to the judge that Richie had completed all terms of her probation.

<doc id="391025" wikidata="Q1137442" url="?curid=391025" title="Diaochan">
<text>Diaochan was one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Although based on a minor historical personage, she is mostly a fictional character. She is best known for her role in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the events in the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, she has a romance with the warrior Lü Bu and causes him to betray and kill his foster father, the tyrannical warlord Dong Zhuo. She was praised in tales as a woman of unrivaled beauty who did what no other hero in China was able to accomplish: put an end to Dong Zhuo&#x27;s regime of terror and the eventual end of Lü Bu; triggering the events that would lead to the formation of the Three Kingdoms: Cao Wei, Eastern Wu, and Shu Han.

== Name and basis ==
Chinese historical records indicate that Lü Bu had a secret affair with one of Dong Zhuo&#x27;s courtesans and he constantly feared that Dong Zhuo would find out. This was one of the reasons why he betrayed and assassinated Dong Zhuo in May 192. However, the courtesan&#x27;s name was not recorded. The name &quot;Diaochan&quot; first appeared in &quot;Sanguozhi Pinghua&quot; as the courtesy name of Lü Bu&#x27;s wife. A later &quot;zaju Duoji&quot; (now lost) explained the name, which literally means &quot;sable cicada&quot;, as derived from the sable tails and jade decorations in the shape of cicadas which adorned the hats of high-ranking officials in the Eastern Han dynasty.

== In folk tales ==
In earlier stories, Diaochan was described as Lü Bu&#x27;s wife who had been accidentally separated from Lü Bu during the political disorder and was unaware of the conspiracy against Dong Zhuo. Later stories removed this background and had her more actively participating in the scheme. Narrations about Diaochan&#x27;s ultimate fate appeared in Yuan dynasty &quot;zaju&quot;. The titles of these lost works suggest Diaochan, viewed as a &quot;femme fatale&quot;, was decapitated by Guan Yu after Lü Bu&#x27;s death, which was inherited by some of later Ming or Qing operas featuring Diaochan.

In the Yuan dynasty play &quot;Lianhuan Ji&quot; (連環計), Diaochan is said to be the daughter of Ren Ang (任昂), and her real name is Ren Hongchang (任紅昌). She is in charge of taking care of the Sable Cicada Hat (貂蟬冠), so she becomes known as &quot;Diaochan&quot; (literally &quot;sable cicada&quot;). She is introduced to Guan Yu by Zhang Fei after Lü Bu&#x27;s death. Instead of accepting her as the spoils of war, Guan Yu decapitates her with his sword. This event is not mentioned in historical records or the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, but is propagated through mass media such as operas and storytelling.

Diaochan&#x27;s eventual fate differs in various accounts, but mainly along the following types:

*First, she is killed by Dong Zhuo&#x27;s followers, along with Wang Yun, after Lü Bu escapes; 
*Second, she follows Lü Bu while he roams around with his forces, but is executed along with Lü Bu after the latter&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Xiapi or killed herself after Cao Cao had taken possession of her;
*Third, Diaochan is captured by Cao Cao after the Battle of Xiapi but saved by Zhao Yun, to whom she later marries;
*Fourth, as told in some traditional operas, Cao Cao presents Diaochan after the Battle of Xiapi to Guan Yu in the hope of winning Guan Yu&#x27;s loyalty. Guan Yu, however, sees her as a femme fatale in light of her role in the undoings of Lü Bu and Dong Zhuo. He kills her to prevent her influence on him or his sworn brothers Liu Bei and Zhang Fei;
*Fifth, Guan Yu, impressed by Diaochan&#x27;s sacrifice in bringing down Lü Bu and Dong Zhuo, saves her from Cao Cao at the Battle of Xiapi and sends her away. Diaochan becomes a nun and writes down her stories for posterity.

== In &quot;the Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; ==


In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Diaochan assists the official Wang Yun in a plot to persuade Lü Bu to kill his foster father, the tyrannical warlord Dong Zhuo. Wang Yun presents her to Dong Zhuo as a concubine, but also betrothes her to Lü Bu at the same time. Diaochan uses her beauty to turn Dong Zhuo and Lü Bu against each other by inciting jealousy between them.

While Dong Zhuo is out one day, Lü Bu sneaks into his bedroom in the hope of seeing Diaochan. Diaochan pretends to be very upset and attempts suicide by throwing herself into the pond, saying that she is ashamed to see Lü Bu because she had been violated by Dong Zhuo. Lü Bu is heartbroken and promises that he will not let her suffer further at the hands of Dong Zhuo. Just then, Dong Zhuo returns and sees them embracing each other. As Lü Bu flees, Dong Zhuo chases him and hurls a spear at him, but misses. On the way, Dong Zhuo meets his adviser, Li Ru, who suggests to him to let Lü Bu have Diaochan, so as to win Lü Bu&#x27;s trust. Dong Zhuo goes back to Diaochan later and accuses her of betraying his love, saying that he intends to present her to Lü Bu. Diaochan replies indignantly that Lü Bu embraced her against her will and attempts suicide to &quot;prove her love&quot; for Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo is moved and dismisses the idea of relinquishing her.

Lü Bu is outraged and goes to Wang Yun&#x27;s house to vent his frustration. Wang Yun then uses the opportunity to instigate Lü Bu to join the plot to kill Dong Zhuo. Lü Bu kills Dong Zhuo when the latter shows up at a ceremony for Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him; the ceremony is actually a trap set by Wang Yun and Lü Bu. After Dong Zhuo&#x27;s death, Lü Bu marries Diaochan and flees Chang&#x27;an with her when he is defeated by Dong Zhuo&#x27;s former followers.

Later in the novel, Diaochan has only a cameo in the Battle of Xiapi, and is not mentioned again thereafter.

== In modern popular culture ==

Diaochan appears a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;, &quot;Aura Kingdom &quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. In the video game &quot;Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty&quot;, Diao Chan is the fake identity of sorceress Hong Jing. She also appears in the manga series &quot;Souten Kouro&quot;. In the card game &quot;&quot;, there is a Legendary Creature card called &quot;Diaochan, Artful Beauty&quot;. Similarly, Diaochan appears as an alternate skin for the rogue class in the card game &quot;Hearthstone&quot;, titled Diao Chan &quot;Valeera&quot;. She also appears as a character in &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;. 

Notable actresses who have portrayed Diaochan in films and television series include: Violet Koo in &quot;Diao Chan&quot; (1938); Lin Dai in &quot;Diao Chan&quot; (1958); Nina Li in &quot;The Beauty Diu Sim&quot; (1987); Chen Hong in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (1994) and &quot;Diao Chan and Lü Bu&quot; (2001); Irene Chiu in &quot;Guan Gong&quot; (1996); Sharla Cheung in &quot;Diao Chan&quot; (2002); Chen Hao in &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; (2010); Liu Yifei in &quot;The Assassins&quot; (2012); Gulnazar in &quot;God of War, Zhao Yun&quot; (2016) and &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; (2019); Naomi Watanabe and Suzu Hirose in &quot;The Untold Tale of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (2020).

<doc id="391026" wikidata="Q211936" url="?curid=391026" title="Francisco Macías Nguema">
<text>Francisco Macías Nguema (born Mez-m Ngueme, later Africanised to Masie Nguema Biyogo Ñegue Ndong; 1 January 1924 – 29 September 1979), often referred to as Macías Nguema or simply Macías, was an Equatoguinean politician who served as the first president of Equatorial Guinea from the country&#x27;s gaining of independence in 1968, until his overthrow in 1979. He is widely remembered as one of the most brutal dictators in history. As president, he exhibited bizarre and erratic behavior, to the point that many of his contemporaries believed he was insane.

A member of the Fang people, Macías Nguema held numerous official positions under Spanish colonial rule before being elected the first president of the soon-to-be independent country in 1968. Early in his rule, he consolidated power by establishing an extreme cult of personality and a one-party state ruled by his United National Workers&#x27; Party (PUNT), and declaring himself president for life in 1972.

Domestically, his presidency was characterized by attempts at Africanization and harsh persecution of non-Fang ethnic groups. In foreign policy, he quickly turned against Spain and allied himself with the Eastern Bloc, receiving support from the Soviet Union, Cuba and North Korea, and to a lesser extent, France and its local allies such as Cameroonian President Ahmadou Ahidjo and Gabonese President Omar Bongo, although relations with Cameroon and Gabon collapsed by 1976. Due to his dictatorship&#x27;s severe human rights abuses and economic mismanagement, tens of thousands of people fled the country to avoid persecution. This led to Equatorial Guinea being internationally nicknamed the &quot;Dachau of Africa&quot;. His rule also led to significant brain drain, as intellectuals and educated classes were particular targets for his persecution. In 1979, he was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état by his nephew Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo and was subsequently tried and executed.

According to various sources, anywhere from 20,000 to 80,000 of the roughly 200,000 to 300,000 people living in the country were killed under his regime, with tens of thousands more fleeing the country. He has been compared to Pol Pot because of the violent, unpredictable, and anti-intellectual nature of his government.

== Background and early life ==
Francisco Macías Nguema was born on 1 January 1924, as Mez-m Ngueme at Nzangayong, Spanish Guinea, to parents who had been expelled with the rest of their clan from what is today Woleu-Ntem Province, Gabon, at a time when the Spanish Colonial Guard had not yet exerted control over the jungled area. He belonged to the Esangui clan, part of the Fang, Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s majority ethnic group. His family settled in Mongomo, where he grew up. Differing accounts exist of Macías Nguema&#x27;s parentage and childhood, with some alleging that he was the son of a witch doctor who allegedly killed his younger brother as a sacrifice. Other accounts claims that his father was merely a local Fang noble. According to this version, at age nine, Macías saw his father being fatally beaten by a local colonial administrator, when he tried to use his title to negotiate better wages for his people, Macías being orphaned a week later when his mother committed suicide, leaving him and 10 siblings to fend for themselves. 

Macías Nguema managed to survive several bouts of tuberculosis as a child, which left him with a profound fear of death for the remainder of his life. He was educated at a Catholic school through to primary level. He changed his name to Francisco Macías Nguema at this time after being baptized by Spanish Catholic missionaries, and would come to learn Spanish in addition to his native Fang. During his adolescence, he worked as a servant for some wealthy Spanish settlers, being described as helpful and obedient, which earned him ridicule and mistreatment by other non-Christianized Fang, and showed an inferiority complex with respect to the Spaniards.

=== Possible mental illness ===
Medical reports from his early career suggested that Macías Nguema was mentally unstable. Based on a report from 1968, the French foreign intelligence service SDECE argued that he suffered from mental disorders and venereal diseases whose effects on his psyche were made even worse by his regular abuse of drugs such as cannabis in the form of the edible derivative &quot;bhang&quot;, and &quot;iboga&quot;, a drink with strong hallucinogenic effects. 

Several contemporaries, such as the French ambassador to Equatorial Guinea, argued that Macías Nguema was insane. Some observers have posited that Macías Nguema may have been a psychopath, a disorder potentially enabled, in part, by reported childhood psychological trauma, and that his behaviour could have been affected by other possible mental illnesses, as well as his reported periodic use of drugs. Journalist Paul Kenyon described Macías Nguema as &quot;dangerously mentally ill&quot;.

==Early career==
Macías Nguema failed the civil service exam three times in the 1930s. Regardless, he eventually became a clerk in the Spanish colonial administration, after passing the exam on the fourth try with assistance and some favoritism from colonial authorities, serving as court interpreter. In the 1940s, he also worked for the Forest Service in Bata, the Río Benito Public Works Department, as a catechist in Bata, and in the Bata Public Works Service. In 1961, he first travelled to Madrid as spokesperson for a delegation which honoured Francisco Franco, Spain&#x27;s dictator, on the 25th anniversary of his seizure of power. At the time, Macías Nguema generally displayed no anti-Spanish sentiment and collaborated with the authorities, preferring to work towards eventual independence within the existing system. Unlike many Equatoguinean activists at the time, he was never jailed by the Spanish.

As court interpreter, Macías Nguema eventually began taking bribes to manipulate his translations to absolve or incriminate defendants. The Spanish interpreted his important role in many trials as evidence for influence and talent for leadership, and began to rapidly promote him. He became assistant interpreter, mayor of Mongomo, minister of public works, and finally deputy president of the Governing Council within a single year in the 1960s after Spanish Guinea was transformed from a colony to a province of Spain. He also served as a member of the territorial parliament. 

Even at this early point of his career, Macías Nguema already exhibited erratic tendencies. In a conference to discuss the future independence of Equatorial Guinea at Madrid, he suddenly began an &quot;incoherent eulogy of the Nazis&quot;, claiming that Adolf Hitler had wanted to save Africans from colonialism and only got &quot;confused&quot;, causing him to attempt to conquer Europe. At one point he declared himself a &quot;Hitlerian-Marxist&quot;

In 1964, Macías Nguema was named deputy prime minister of the autonomous transition government established the prior year. Around this time, Macías Nguema himself came to fear that he was mentally unstable. Before the 1968 Spanish Guinean general election, aged 44, he travelled to Madrid, where he was treated at the Ruben clinic. Despite these concerns, Macías Nguema ran for president of the soon-to-be independent country against Prime Minister Bonifacio Ondó Edú on a strongly nationalist platform in 1968. 

He employed a Spanish lawyer to write his texts, providing him with a coherent agenda, and made various promises to improve his popularity. He would point at European-owned houses and ask the crowds if they wanted to own the place; when they responded positively, he stated that he would give them to the listeners if they voted for him. However, Macías Nguema was easily distracted from his speeches, and often made &quot;chaotic public appearances&quot;. His bouts of erratic behavior were generally believed to be the sign of a &quot;fearless&quot; and &quot;charming&quot; leader. 

In what has been the only free election held in the country to date, he defeated Ondó Edú in the runoff and was sworn in as president on 12 October. During his time as president-elect, he was awarded the Collar of the Order of Civil Merit. He was also made Commander of the for his service during the colonial administration. By this point he had also distanced himself from Catholicism, becoming outwardly critical of the Church.

== Presidency ==
=== Early rule ===
After assuming power, Macías Nguema initially maintained a moderate policy and good relations with Spain, but within a year began to hold inflammatory, anti-European speeches and claimed that there were plots to overthrow him. His rival Bonifacio Ondó Edú then fled to Gabon. Relations with Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Luis Carrero Blanco had rapidly deteriorated. The coffers of the only two banks in the new country, the Banco Exterior de España and the Banco de Crédito, were emptied, meaning officials could not be paid. The country still lacked a national bank or its own currency, meaning the Spanish peseta had to be used, and according to the transition agreements with Spain, any biennial budgets approved for the territory prior to independence would need to be used, but Spain refused to honor its obligations. 

In March 1969, Macías Nguema arrested his own foreign minister and political rival, Atanasio Ndongo Miyone, on treason charges, and killed him by defenestrating him. Macías then took photographs of Ndongo dying on the street, later showing the album to &quot;Newsweek&quot; correspondent John Barnes. Ondó Edú was also captured and brought back to Equatorial Guinea, where he and several other senior officials were killed at Black Beach. Macías Nguema then accused Spain of creating an economic blockade by refusing to acknowledge obligations under the transition agreements, declaring he would not abide by the 1968 Constitution that had been &quot;imposed&quot; on the country by Spain and which he opposed. 

He began travelling the country, encouraging his followers to fight against the Spanish, provoking a diplomatic crisis, also ordering the confiscation of all weapons possessed by Spaniards in the country and demanding they abandon all property they owned there. The Spanish government subsequently organized the evacuation of all its citizens (roughly 7,500) and all its Civil Guard forces, while the British ambassador described the Equatoguinean capital as being in a state of total chaos. 

At this point, Macías Nguema still recognized his own mental instability, and again sought help. After assuming the presidency, he made a secret trip to Barcelona and visited a psychiatrist for help. Although little was known about what advice the Spanish expert gave Macías Nguema, Kenyon argued that the treatment appeared to have failed, considering the president&#x27;s subsequent development. Macías Nguema persisted in consuming large amounts of drugs.

On Christmas Eve 1969, Macías Nguema had 186 alleged dissidents executed inside the national football stadium in Malabo, as amplifiers in the stadium played Mary Hopkin&#x27;s song &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;. 150 of them were shot or hanged, with the remaining 36 being ordered to dig ditches, in which they were subsequently buried up to their necks and eaten alive by red ants over the next few days. A commonly circulated claim that these mass executions were performed by executioners dressed up as Santa Claus is almost certainly a fabrication, as this sensational detail does not appear in any primary sources about the incident.

In 1971, he began forcing the entire population to undergo daily military training with a wooden rifle.

On 7 May 1971, Macías Nguema issued Decree 415, which repealed parts of the 1968 Constitution and granted him &quot;all direct powers of Government and Institutions&quot;, including powers formerly held by the legislative and judiciary branches, as well as the cabinet of ministers. On 18 October 1971, Law 1 imposed the death penalty as punishment for threatening the President or the government. Insulting or offending the President or his cabinet was punishable by 30 years in prison. On 14 July 1972, a presidential decree merged all existing political parties into the United National Party, later the United National Workers&#x27; Party, with Macías Nguema as President for Life of both the nation and the party. Fearing that the Spanish wanted to overthrow him, Macías Nguema offered promotions and other rewards to anyone who revealed a Spanish spy. This led to a climate of fear and suspicion, as owning the wrong book or having talked with the wrong person could result in punishment, imprisonment or death.

Having turned against Spain, Macías Nguema allied with the Eastern Bloc, enlisting support from the Soviet Union, Cuba, and North Korea. He allowed the Soviets to channel weapons through Equatorial Guinea to the MPLA in Angola, while repeatedly threatening to terminate this alliance in order to blackmail the Eastern Bloc into providing him with money. Throughout the 1970s, Macías Nguema exploited the Sino-Soviet split to play his backers against each other. The Soviets, Chinese and North Koreans provided Macías Nguema with military trainers and bodyguards. Soviet military assistance by 1975 amounted to small arms, eight patrol boats, twenty armored vehicles, and an An-24 passenger aircraft, although the latter quickly fell into disrepair. By 1977, about 200 soldiers had been trained in the East Bloc. China and Cuba also contributed large numbers of technical experts, although their contributions were more varied, a 1976 U.S. diplomatic cable reporting that the vast majority of Cuban experts worked in the fields of teaching, medicine, agriculture, and public works, mostly on the mainland.

Macías Nguema reportedly viewed Chinese assistance in the most favorable light owing to the perceived lack of strings and the humble lifestyle of Chinese advisors and by 1974, only Spain exceeded China in aid contributions. In 1977, Macías Nguema took a trip to East Asia in hopes of shoring up support from China and North Korea in the face of increased Soviet and Cuban frustration. His relationship with North Korea remained good until his overthrow. He admired the North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung, and according to his daughter Monica Macias, the two were friends.

During the early 1970s, France also attempted to court Macías Nguema, who maintained good relationships with their closest regional allies, Cameroon and Gabon. For example, following the reported arrest of approximately 160 notables in August of 1971, including the ambassador to Cameroon, the official French response was to back Macías Nguema&#x27;s claim that the arrests were made following the discovery of a &quot;Bubi conspiracy&quot; against the president. These relations sharply declined as increasing numbers of refugees from Rio Muni poured into Cameroon, many coming to be employed in Cameroonian industrial plantations, which Macías Nguema claimed was a form of exploitation of his nationals. Cameroon and Gabon in turn raised concerns about the growing Eastern Bloc presence, and by 1976, relations had collapsed.

Starting in the early 1970s, Macías Nguema began repressing the non-Fang ethnic groups in the country, such as the Bubi people of Santa Isabel, whom he associated with relative wealth and education, and the Annobónese, due to what he felt was too much affection for Spain. In the decade preceding independence, Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco had actively promoted Bubi nationalism on Fernando Po in hopes of gaining leverage over mainland Fang leaders, in an unsuccessful bid to extend Spanish rule. During the post-independence years, these tensions did not abate. Santa Isabel was then militarized, with its inhabitants harassed. Pagalu, part of Annobón, was cut off from aid during a 1973 cholera epidemic, resulting in around 100 deaths. In 1972, mass arrests had taken place on Annobón after a majority of its electorate voted against Macías Nguema in the 1968 elections. Use of the Fang language was forcibly imposed, with penalties for anyone caught using Spanish or languages belonging to ethnic minorities.

=== Totalitarian dictatorship ===
==== Growing paranoia and cult of personality ====
In a plebiscite held on 29 July 1973, the 1968 Constitution was replaced with a new document that gave Macías Nguema absolute power and formally made his party the only one legally permitted. According to official figures, 99 percent of voters approved the new document. The same year, a United Nations mission was expelled from the country. Macías Nguema went on to establish a totalitarian regime with three important pillars: the United National Workers&#x27; Party, the Juventud en Marcha con Macías (JMM; ) militia/youth group, and the Esangui clan of Río Muni. The country&#x27;s instruments of repression (the military and presidential bodyguard) were entirely controlled by Macías Nguema&#x27;s relatives and clan members. 

The JMM became increasingly powerful, and its members abused their powers, often drunkenly harassing and imprisoning individuals based on mere suspicions of sympathy for dissident ideas. The President mostly filled his inner circle with family members such as Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who was his nephew and served as military governor of Bioko and Vice-Minister of the Armed Forces. 

Macías Nguema developed an extreme cult of personality, and assigned himself titles such as the &quot;Unique Miracle&quot; and &quot;Grand Master of Education, Science, and Culture&quot;. The island of Fernando Pó had its name Africanised after him to Masie Ngueme Biyogo Island; upon his overthrow in 1979, its name was again changed to Bioko. The capital, Santa Isabel, had its name changed to Malabo. His cult of personality even infiltrated the Catholic Church in Equatorial Guinea, as priests were ordered to thank the President before Mass, while pictures of him were placed in churches. At the &quot;Iglesia de San Fernando&quot; in Malabo a photo of the President was adorned with the statement &quot;God created Equatorial Guinea thanks to Macías&quot;.

Macías Nguema suffered from extreme paranoia, and saw plots against his life and rule everywhere. As time went on, he ordered the mass murder of government ministers, members of the National Assembly, officials, and even members of his own family. Intellectuals and skilled professionals were a particular target, with human rights researcher Robert af Klinteberg describing Macías Nguema&#x27;s policy as &quot;deliberate cultural regression&quot;. The president&#x27;s paranoid actions included mandating the death of those who wore glasses, banning use of the word &quot;intellectual&quot; and destroying boats to stop his people fleeing from his rule. Fishing was banned. He was known to order entire villages destroyed just to eliminate one suspected dissident.

His prisons, most importantly Black Beach, were notorious for human rights abuses; prisoners were humiliated, starved, tortured, and murdered without due process. When there was a trial at all, dissidents faced kangaroo courts organized by the JMM militia, as almost all judges in the country fled or were jailed during Macías Nguema&#x27;s rule. In one of these show trials in 1974, even the defence team of the accused requested a death sentence for their clients. Prisoners sentenced to death were usually beaten to death with wooden clubs. Female prisoners were also subjected to rape, often in front of their husbands. Macías Nguema&#x27;s regime often imprisoned entire families, including the spouses and children of suspected dissidents. The abuse in the prisons was overseen by Obiang, who reportedly enjoyed mocking and torturing the prisoners. Among the few people who could still convince Macías Nguema to spare suspected dissidents were his relatives, such as Raimundo Ela Nve Senior, though his circle of confidants grew ever smaller.

==== Last years ====
Growing increasingly paranoid, Macías Nguema no longer slept at the presidential palace from around 1974 and visited the capital on ever more rare occasions. Instead, he began holing up in a fortified villa at his home village of Mongomo; the location had a private bunker as well as prison and was protected by a military camp. The villa&#x27;s private prison usually housed about 300 inmates, and the President occasionally personally executed some of them. As time went on, Macías Nguema&#x27;s actions became ever more bizarre. He declared private education subversive, and banned it entirely with Decree 6 on 18 March 1975. 

He Africanized his name to &quot;&quot; in 1976 after demanding that the rest of the Equatoguinean population replace their Hispanic names with African names. He also banned Western clothes, foods and medicines for the rest of the population, stating that they were un-African, with Macías Nguema obtaining the little food available and reselling it at prices the vast majority of the population could not afford to punish those he thought did not want to work. As he also decided at what time the food would be resold, products would often be expired before they were offered to the public. 

He eventually outlawed Christianity, and used the slogan, sometimes claimed to be the national motto &quot;There is no other God than Macías&quot;. Owning anything related to Christianity became a reason for imprisonment due to alleged support for anti-government plots or coup attempts.

Following his repeated purges and unpredictable policies, the country&#x27;s government began to fall apart. During Macías Nguema&#x27;s rule, the country had neither a development plan nor an accounting system or budget for government funds. After the killing of the governor of the Central Bank, he carried everything that remained in the national treasury to his Mongomo villa. Statisticians were also heavily repressed, and as a consequence, little economic data was generated on Equatorial Guinea during the 1970s. When the director of the Equatorial Guinea Institute of Statistics, Saturnin Antonio Ndongo, published demographic data considered too low by Macías, he was dismembered to &quot;help him learn to count&quot;. 

After 1973, his regime also suppressed private commercial activity, and due to a lack of exports and foreign investment (the latter due to Macías Nguema&#x27;s refusal in most cases), the nation lacked foreign currency, meaning that the Equatorial Guinean ekwele introduced in 1975, which had quickly lost nearly all value, could not be replaced. Only Macías Nguema, the army, and the police were able to receive a regular salary during this time, with others sometimes going months without getting paid, eventually leading to the economy regressing to a subsistence barter system and government services shrinking to only cover internal security. Starting in 1976, Macías Nguema mandated that all children between the ages of 7 and 14 receive military training, and that any parent or person refusing would be imprisoned or shot.

Tens of thousands of citizens responded by fleeing in fear of persecution and to protect their personal safety. Af Klinteberg reported that as of 1978, at least 101,000 persons, out of a contemporary population that the World Bank estimates totalled 215,284 persons—nearly 47% of the population—had fled the country. Other reporting, such as a 1979 &quot;Time&quot; magazine account stating that &quot;perhaps 150,000&quot; persons fled, suggests that the proportion of the population that sought safety in exile may have approached 70%, based on the World Bank&#x27;s estimate of the population in 1979. By the end of his rule, nearly all of the country&#x27;s educated class was either executed or forced into exile—a brain drain from which the country has never recovered. Two-thirds of the legislature and 10 of his original ministers were also killed or had been disappeared. 

To prevent people from escaping, Macías Nguema had the only road out of the country mined, and camouflaged ditches with spikes constructed along the mainland border. In 1976, Nigeria evacuated 45,000 contract laborers from the country, citing &quot;brutal ill treatment&quot; by Macías Nguema&#x27;s regime. In 1977, responding to falling cocoa production (one of the country&#x27;s main export items), the President instituted a &quot;system of slavery&quot;. During his presidency, his country was nicknamed the &quot;Dachau of Africa&quot;, after the Nazi concentration camp, with condemnations of his government issued by the International Commission of Jurists, World Council of Churches, the UN, the Organisation of African Unity, Amnesty International, and the European Commission.

By 1978, a United States House of Representatives joint resolution condemning him for acts of religious persecution and genocide had been proposed. By 1979, his servants stated that Macías Nguema had become increasingly withdrawn, often spending the time mostly alone at his Mongomo villa. He would wander around, repeatedly saying the names of his victims, and worshipping a collection of heads as per Fang tradition, hoping that this would grant him power. Even more disturbing to the servants was one occasion, however, when he ordered a meal and table to be prepared for eight guests. He then sat there alone, casually talking &quot;with the dead&quot;. 

Members of Macías Nguema&#x27;s inner circle and government officials became more and more worried about his erratic behavior. At this point, the government had mostly ceased to function, as most minister posts were vacant, officials were no longer paid, and the National Assembly was effectively defunct, while the JMM militia ran amok across Equatorial Guinea, drunkenly murdering civilians. The overcrowding of the prisons was solved through regular mass executions, though many prisoners were simply left to starve to death. Even the presidential guards were forced to survive by scavenging fruits and hunting wild animals, as supply had mostly collapsed. 

In mid-April 1979, Macías Nguema&#x27;s wife travelled to North Korea for surgery, taking their three younger children, Monica, Maribel, and Paco, with her.

=== Overthrow ===
By 1979, Macías Nguema&#x27;s government had garnered condemnation from the United Nations and European Commission. That summer, Macías Nguema organised the execution of several members of his own family, leading several members of his inner circle to fear that he was no longer acting rationally. On 3 August 1979, he was overthrown by Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, whose brother was among those murdered by the President. Obiang achieved his coup mostly with the help of his cousins with whom he had previously attended a Spanish military academy together and who now headed the military. As Macías Nguema was still at his palace, isolated from the rest of the country due to his fear of being overthrown, the coup met no organized opposition.

The deposed ruler and a contingent of loyal forces initially tried to resist the coup upon hearing of it, but his forces eventually abandoned him. He fled into the jungle of Rio Muni, possibly intending to get across the border into exile, but was captured on 18 August. The former president was found by an old woman; he was exhausted and probably delirious, sitting beneath a tree and eating sugarcane. Obiang&#x27;s troops proceeded to arrest him, and found his nearby car stuffed full of suitcases with $4 million in cash. 

It was believed that Macías Nguema had actually burned $100 million (much of Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s cash reserves) before attempting to escape the country as revenge. When his wife heard of his overthrow, she returned to Equatorial Guinea to protect their eldest son. Monica, Maribel, and Paco remained behind for their own safety, and consequently lived in North Korea for the remainder of their childhood. Monica stated that Kim Il Sung honored his friendship to Macías Nguema by acting as their guardian and financing their education.

==Trial and execution==

The Supreme Military Council opened Case 1979 on 18 August 1979, and began interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence against the Macías Nguema government. The Council subsequently convened a military tribunal on 24 September to try Macías Nguema and ten members of his government. The charges for the ten defendants included genocide, mass murder, embezzlement of public funds, violations of human rights, and treason. Besides the deposed President, the accused were described by Kenyon as &quot;bit-part actors&quot; who had held no important positions under the old regime. Their presence was supposed to make the trial look more legitimate. Macías Nguema appeared generally calm and unafraid during the trial.

The state prosecutor requested that Macías Nguema receive a death sentence, five others receive 30-year sentences, three others receive a year in prison, and two be sentenced to time served. Macías Nguema&#x27;s defense counsel countered that the other co-defendants were responsible for specific crimes, and asked for acquittal. Macías Nguema himself delivered a statement to the court outlining what he viewed as the extensive good deeds he had performed for the country. At noon on 29 September 1979, the Tribunal delivered its sentences, which were more severe than what the prosecution had requested. Macías Nguema and six of his co-defendants were sentenced to death, and the confiscation of their property; the deposed President was sentenced to death &quot;101 times&quot;. Two defendants were sentenced to fourteen years in prison each, and two others to four years each.

With no higher court available to hear appeals, the decision of the Special Military Tribunal was final. However, one problem arose, as Macías Nguema reportedly swore that his ghost would return and take revenge on those who had condemned him. As a result, the Equatoguinean soldiers refused to shoot him. A group of hired Moroccan troops was instead employed to carry out the sentence. The 55-year old Macías Nguema and the six other defendants sentenced to death were executed by the hired firing squad at Black Beach Prison, at 6 pm the same day.

== Regime impact ==
At his trial, Macías Nguema&#x27;s regime was estimated to have killed between 20,000 and 50,000 people, equating to between 9 and 23 percent of the country&#x27;s contemporary population, with some estimates ranging as high as 80,000 deaths. The lower end of estimates by scholars such as Scott Straus and Max Liniger-Goumaz, however, are approximately 5,000. By the end of Macías Nguema&#x27;s rule, over half the population had been arrested at least once, or had a relative who had been killed. During his trial, 514 deaths were specifically enumerated. Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s per capita income fell from about $1,420 in 1968 to about $70 in 1975. Infant mortality rose to about 60%. National life expectancy declined to about 30 years.

== Family ==
Macías Nguema&#x27;s wider clan, led by Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, still leads Equatorial Guinea as of today. By 2007, his children had all left North Korea. However, Macías Nguema&#x27;s daughter Mónica had relocated from North Korea to South Korea, considering Korea her home and Korean her native tongue; she had published a Korean-language memoir about her own life. Macías Nguema&#x27;s wife and daughter Maribel live in Spain, and his sons in Equatorial Guinea.

<text>César Julio Romero Jr. (February 15, 1907 – January 1, 1994) was an American actor and activist. He was active in film, radio, and television for almost 60 years. His wide range of screen roles included Latin lovers, historical figures in costume dramas, characters in light domestic comedies, and the Joker on the live action &quot;Batman&quot; television series of the mid-1960s, which was included in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time. He was the first actor to play the character.

==Early life==

César Julio Romero Jr. was born in New York City on February 15, 1907, the son of César Julio Romero Sr. (1872–1951) and María Mantilla (1880–1962). His mother was a concert singer and said to be the biological daughter of Cuban national hero José Martí. His father was born in Barcelona and emigrated to the United States in 1888, where he was an import/export merchant. He was a first cousin of silent film star Emerson Romero, who was a few years older than César and came to New York in 1907 to attend a school for the deaf.

Romero grew up in Bradley Beach, New Jersey, and went to Bradley Beach Elementary School, Asbury Park High School, the Collegiate School, and the Riverdale Country Day School. After his parents lost their sugar-import business and suffered losses in the Wall Street crash of 1929, Romero&#x27;s Hollywood earnings allowed him to support his large family, all of whom followed him to the American West Coast years later. Romero, who referred to himself as &quot;a Latin from Manhattan&quot;, lived on and off with various family members for the rest of his life.

On October 12, 1942, he enlisted in the United States Coast Guard as an apprentice seaman and served in the Pacific Theater of Operations. He reported aboard the Coast Guard-crewed assault transport in November 1943. According to a press release from the period, Romero saw action during the invasions of Tinian and Saipan. The same article mentioned that he preferred to be a regular part of the crew and was eventually promoted to the rating of chief boatswain&#x27;s mate.

==Career in film==


The 6&#x27;3&quot; [190 cm] Romero routinely played &quot;Latin lovers&quot; in films from the 1930s until the 1950s, usually in supporting roles. In 1935, Romero played a leading role &quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; opposite Marlene Dietrich. Romero starred as the Cisco Kid in six westerns made between 1939 and 1941. Romero danced and performed comedy in the 20th Century Fox films he starred in opposite Carmen Miranda and Betty Grable, such as &quot;Week-End in Havana&quot; and &quot;Springtime in the Rockies&quot;, in the 1940s. He also played a minor role as Sinjin, a piano player in Glenn Miller&#x27;s band, in the 1942 20th Century Fox musical &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot;.

In &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934), Romero played a villainous supporting role opposite the film&#x27;s main stars William Powell and Myrna Loy. Many of Romero&#x27;s films from this early period saw him cast in small character parts, such as Italian gangsters and East Indian princes. Romero had a lead role as the Pathan rebel leader, Khoda Khan, in John Ford&#x27;s British Raj-era action film &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot; (1937) starring Shirley Temple and Victor McLaglen and a supporting role as the Indian servant Ram Dass in &quot;The Little Princess&quot; (1939), also with Temple. He also appeared in a comic turn as a foil for Frank Sinatra and his crew in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960) starring the Rat Pack (Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop).

Romero sometimes played the leading man, for example in Allan Dwan&#x27;s &quot;15 Maiden Lane&quot; (1936) opposite Claire Trevor, as well as winning the key role of the Doc Holliday character (with name changed to &quot;Doc Halliday&quot;) in Dwan&#x27;s acclaimed Wyatt Earp saga &quot;Frontier Marshal&quot; (1939) starring Randolph Scott and Nancy Kelly three years later. 20th Century Fox, along with mogul Darryl Zanuck, selected Romero to co-star with Tyrone Power in the Technicolor historical epic &quot;Captain from Castile&quot; (1947), directed by Henry King. While Power played a fictionalized character, Romero played Hernán Cortés, a historical conquistador in Spain&#x27;s conquest of the Americas.

Among almost countless television credits, Romero appeared several times on &quot;The Martha Raye Show&quot; in the mid-1950s. He portrayed Don Diego de la Vega&#x27;s maternal uncle in a number of Season 2 &quot;Zorro&quot; episodes.

In 1958, he guest-starred as Ramon Valdez in &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; in the episode entitled &quot;The Big Order&quot;. He performed the mambo with Gisele MacKenzie on her NBC variety show, &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot;. He guest-starred in 1957 on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot; on the first episode of the seventh season (&quot;Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana&quot;). He played &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, a card sharp on the episode, &quot;The Honorable Don Charlie Story&quot; of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. On January 16, 1958, he appeared on &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;. In 1959, Romero was cast as Joaquin in the episode &quot;Caballero&quot; from &quot;The Texan&quot;, and on September 26 of that year, he hosted the Cuban installment of &quot;John Gunther&#x27;s High Road&quot;.

In 1960, he was cast as Ricky Valenti in &quot;Crime of Passion&quot; from &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;. In 1965, Romero played the head of THRUSH in France in &quot;The Never Never Affair&quot; from &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;

From 1966 to 1968, he portrayed the Joker on &quot;Batman&quot;. He refused to shave his moustache for the role, and so the supervillain&#x27;s white face makeup was simply smeared over it throughout the series&#x27; run and in the 1966 film.

His guest star work in the 1970s included a recurring role on the western comedy &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; as Señor Armendariz, a Mexican rancher feuding with Patrick McCreedy (Burl Ives), the owner of a ranch on the opposite side of the border. He appeared in three episodes. Romero later portrayed Peter Stavros on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (from 1985 to 1987). He also appeared in a sixth-season episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, where he played a suitor named Tony Delvecchio for Sophia. Apart from these television roles, Romero appeared as A.J. Arno, a small-time criminal who continually opposes Dexter Riley (played by Kurt Russell) and his schoolmates of Medfield College in a series of films by Walt Disney Productions in the 1970s.

==Political activities==
A registered Republican, Romero appeared in the Nixon-Lodge bumper sticker motorcade campaign in October 1960, and four years later, initially supported Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. in the write-in campaign supporting Lodge for president. Romero appreciated and said he liked Lodge&#x27;s strong anti-Communist stance in South Vietnam where Lodge was at the time the United States ambassador. During 1964, Romero supported Barry Goldwater in the general election.

Also in 1964, Romero was very much involved in the U.S. Senate race in California that pitted one of Romero&#x27;s best friends and fellow actor, Republican nominee George Murphy (who nicknamed Romero &quot;Butch&quot;), in his bid to oust then-Senator Pierre Salinger, a Democrat.

The Senate race was a heated contest where Salinger had already narrowly defeated then-California State Controller Alan Cranston, who would become a senator in 1968, in the Democratic primary. Both men had &quot;primaried&quot; Senator Clair Engle, who had sought re-nomination despite being terminally ill with a brain tumor; Engle died less than two months after the primary. Then-Democratic Governor Pat Brown appointed Salinger instead of Cranston to fill the vacancy; although the appointment seemed reasonable since Salinger had won the primary, it was roundly criticized by Romero and Murphy as cronyism since Salinger had been the White House press secretary for the late President John F. Kennedy, a close ally of Brown. Romero appealed to disappointed Cranston backers after the primary to support Murphy. Romero&#x27;s urging helped Salinger lose a race no one thought could be lost.

Murphy lost the full use of his voice during his term when part of his larynx was removed due to throat cancer. Romero employed other Hollywood stars to try to help Murphy win re-election in 1970. However, Murphy lost re-election to John V. Tunney, the son of boxing legend Gene Tunney.

After Murphy&#x27;s Senate defeat, Romero scaled back his involvement in politics but would take part for a Hollywood friend, such as Ronald Reagan in his successful gubernatorial bids in 1966 and 1970 as well as all four of his presidential bids in 1968, 1976, 1980, and 1984. Romero also joined with fellow actors and actresses in lobbying the United States Congress to present the then-dying John Wayne with a Congressional Gold Medal for his service to the nation.

==Personal life==

Romero never married and had no children. Many Hollywood historians and biographers have speculated on Romero being very private about his sexuality. In 1996, Boze Hadleigh wrote a book, &quot;Hollywood Gays&quot;, containing a series of claimed interviews in which Romero allegedly came out. Romero died two years before the book was released, and while many of the interviews in the book are disputed as possible forgeries, many are not disputed.

Charlie Harper, lead singer of English punk band UK Subs, is reportedly a nephew of Romero.

==Death==
On January 1, 1994, 45 days short of his 87th birthday, Romero died from complications of a blood clot while being treated for bronchitis and pneumonia at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California.

His body was cremated and the ashes were interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California.

For his contributions to the motion picture and television industry, Romero has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6615 Hollywood Boulevard for film and another star at
1719 Vine Street for television.

<text>Steven Edward Duren (born September 4, 1956), better known by his stage name Blackie Lawless, is an American singer, songwriter and musician, best known as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist (formerly bassist) for heavy metal band W.A.S.P.

== Early life ==

Duren was born in Tampa, Florida, and raised in Staten Island, New York City. He had a fundamentalist Baptist upbringing. He has said that he was &quot;very active&quot; in church as a youth and was born again at age 11. In his late teens, Duren strayed from the church and became interested in the occult. Although he would only study occultism for a short time before leaving that too, he continued to use themes of occultism up until his return to the Christian faith in recent years.

He is the nephew of the late Major League Baseball pitcher Ryne Duren. Lawless himself considered pursuing a professional baseball career; however, he ultimately opted for music. He credits his older brother with introducing him to the guitar.

== Career ==
Lawless began his career in music playing with bands such as Black Rabbit and Orfax Rainbow. In 1975, after Johnny Thunders left the glam rock band New York Dolls in the middle of a tour of Florida, the band started auditioning for guitarists. Lawless was hired but only stayed for the remainder of the tour.
After the tour, he went to California with bassist Arthur Kane and helped found Killer Kane. At that time, Lawless&#x27; stage name was &quot;Blackie Goozeman&quot; as stated on the back of Killer Kane&#x27;s only EP. About a year later Kane returned to New York City but Lawless decided to stay in West Los Angeles. In 1976, he formed Sister, which also featured future W.A.S.P. guitarist Randy Piper. Around 1978, a new lineup was assembled which included Nikki Sixx as bassist and Lizzie Grey on guitar. Later, Chris Holmes joined.

Lawless later formed a band called Circus Circus in 1979, with Piper again appearing in the lineup. In 1981, following Circus Circus&#x27; failure, Lawless joined Lizzie Grey and Nikki Sixx&#x27;s band London, with whom he played a few gigs and recorded two songs as demos, though by this time Sixx had already departed to form Mötley Crüe. In 1982, Lawless switched to bass after firing original member Bassist Rik Fox, later of Steeler fame who had joined the band only 4 months prior and had named W.A.S.P over personal issues, but after that along with Randy Piper, Blackie carried on with W.A.S.P. The lineup was soon completed with Chris Holmes on lead guitar and Tony Richards on drums.

=== W.A.S.P. ===
W.A.S.P. underwent numerous lineup changes, with Lawless being the last remaining original member and chief songwriter. Many of his songs tend to deal with religious or apocalyptic themes, due to his Christian upbringing. Lawless has stated in recent interviews that he has returned to the Christian faith and considers himself a born-again Christian.

Lawless cites influences which include AC/DC, Black Sabbath, the Beatles, Kiss, and Alice Cooper.

Lawless&#x27;s stage theatrics are heavily influenced by Alice Cooper and Kiss, often imitating Gene Simmons and/or Paul Stanley during performances.

In the mid-1980s, W.A.S.P. faced controversy as Lawless spoke out in defense of heavy metal music against the Parents Music Resource Center after the band faced intense scrutiny for their single &quot;Animal (F**k Like a Beast)&quot;.
Despite this, the band achieved their greatest success from 1985 to 1988, with several hit singles including &quot;L.O.V.E. Machine&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Somebody&quot;, and &quot;Wild Child&quot;. In November 2022, Lawless admitted during a Q&amp;A session that he and the band use backing tracks in their live performances.

In a 1989 interview with Erica Ehm, Blackie Lawless stated that he had been shot at twice due to band-related circumstances. This, with the combination of excessive death threats, resulted in the FBI &quot;living with him&quot; for a month. During the same interview, Blackie had stated that at one point he wanted to be a senator.

<text>Langley is an unincorporated community in the census-designated place of McLean in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The name &quot;Langley&quot; often occurs as a metonym for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), whose headquarters, the George Bush Center for Intelligence, is in Langley. 

The land which makes up Langley today once belonged to Thomas Lee, former Crown Governor of the Colony of Virginia from 1749 to 1750. Lee&#x27;s land was named Langley in honor of Langley Hall, which formed part of the Lee home estate in Shropshire, England. In 1839 Benjamin Mackall purchased of land from the Lee family, while keeping the name.

The community was essentially absorbed into McLean many years ago, although there is still a Langley High School. In addition to its roles as a bedroom community for Washington, D.C., and as home to the CIA&#x27;s headquarters, the area is the site of the Federal Highway Administration&#x27;s Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center and formerly the Claude Moore Colonial Farm of the National Park Service, now permanently closed.

==In popular culture==
In the animated series &quot;American Dad!&quot;, the city of Langley Falls, Virginia, in which the show takes place, is loosely based on Langley, being depicted as a somewhat larger city as well as the headquarters of the CIA, where main character Stan Smith works as an agent.

&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Party in the CIA&quot; starts with the line &quot;I moved out to Langley recently&quot;.

In the expansion to the CD Projekt game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;, &quot;Phantom Liberty&quot;, there is a location of the Military Medical Center located in Langley.

A member of the group of three conspiracy theorist hackers in the hit 1990s television series, The X-Files, is named Richard “Ringo” Langly. He and his two cronies, John Fizgerald Byers and Melvin Frohike, referred to themselves as The Lone Gunmen, after the theory that only one man killed John F. Kennedy. Later, the Lone Gunmen were given their own spinoff by 20th Century Fox, but with low ratings, the show only lasted for one season.

Many Twitter users who use the popular NAFO hashtag used in support of Ukraine in the Russian invasion of Ukraine use Langley as a joke location.

<doc id="391036" wikidata="Q706971" url="?curid=391036" title="Maxim Afinogenov">
<text>Maxim Sergeyevich Afinogenov (, ; born September 4, 1979) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player. Known for his skating speed, he was drafted by the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres in the third round, 69th overall, in 1997 and played nine seasons with the club. He then played one season with the Atlanta Thrashers before signing and finishing his career in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

==Personal life==
Afinogenov was first introduced to hockey by his dad when he was five years old. As a youth, he played in the 1993 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Moscow.

He married Russian former professional tennis player, Elena Dementieva on July 16, 2011. His sister Katia Afinogenov married current Toronto Maple Leafs left winger Max Pacioretty one week later.

==Playing career==





===Buffalo Sabres===
Afinogenov was a forward for Dynamo Moscow of the Russian Superleague (RSL) for four seasons. He was drafted 69th overall by the Buffalo Sabres in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft and played his rookie NHL season in 1999–2000, scoring 34 points in 65 games, while also playing in 15 games with the Sabres&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rochester Americans. Following his third season with the Sabres, a 21-goal, 40-point campaign in 2001–02, Afinogenov re-signed with a two-year, $2.4 million contract on September 4, 2002. However, that same day, while playing a pickup game in Moscow, he took a puck to the head, suffering a concussion. He was limited to just 35 games in the subsequent season, managing just 11 points. The next season, in 2003–04, he recorded his first career hat-trick on December 31, 2003, at HSBC Arena in a 7–1 win against the Washington Capitals. He finished the season bouncing back from his previous concussion-riddled season with 17 goals and 31 points.
After spending the 2004–05 season back in Russia with Dynamo Moscow due to the NHL lockout, Afinogenov recorded his best season to date when NHL play resumed in 2005–06 with personal bests of 51 assists and 73 points. As the Sabres embarked on a playoff run to the Conference Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Carolina Hurricanes. Afinogenov added eight points in 18 post-season games. He continued his scoring pace the following season in 2006–07 and, despite missing 26 games, scored 61 points and a career-high 23 goals. During the season, Sabres backup goalie Martin Biron was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers at the trade deadline in February 2007, making Afinogenov the longest-serving Sabre on the roster. His production tailed off in 2007–08, however, managing just 28 points in the same number of games as the previous season.

===Atlanta Thrashers===
Following the 2008–09 season, in which he was sidelined once more with a groin injury, Afinogenov became an unrestricted free agent and was not re-signed by the Sabres. He left the club as the longest-serving Sabre on the previous season&#x27;s roster, having played for the club since his rookie season in 1999–2000. On September 17, 2009, the Atlanta Thrashers invited Afinogenov to their 2009–10 training camp on a tryout. and on September 29, 2009, he signed a one-year contract with the team worth $800,000. He scored his first goal as a Thrasher on October 17, 2009, against the Buffalo Sabres. He finished the season finishing second on the team in points, behind only Nik Antropov.

===KHL===
Following the 2009–10 season, Afinogenov signed a five-year deal with SKA Saint Petersburg in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) as a free agent. After a productive first season with St. Petersburg, Afinogenov was plagued by injury in the following two seasons. He was traded to Podolsk-based HC Vityaz prior to the 2013–14 season and was announced as the team&#x27;s captain.

<doc id="391037" wikidata="Q829683" url="?curid=391037" title="Northern mockingbird">
<text>The northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) is a mockingbird commonly found in North America, of the family Mimidae. The species is also found in some parts of the Caribbean, as well as on the Hawaiian Islands. It is typically a permanent resident across much of its range, but northern mockingbirds may move farther south during inclement weather or prior to the onset of winter. The northern mockingbird has gray to brown upper feathers and a paler belly. Its tail and wings have white patches which are visible in flight.

The species is known for its ability to mimic bird calls and other types of sound, including artificial and electronic noises. Studies have shown its ability to identify individual humans and treat them differently based on learned threat assessments. It is an omnivore and consumes fruit, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. It is often found in open areas, open woodlands and forest edges, and is quite common in urbanized areas. The species breeds from southeastern Canada throughout the United States to the Greater Antilles. It is listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The mockingbird is influential in United States culture, being the state bird of five states, appearing in book titles, songs and lullabies, and making other appearances in popular culture.

==Taxonomy==
Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus first described this species in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as a species of thrush, &quot;Turdus polyglottos&quot;. Its current genus name, &quot;Mimus&quot;, is Latin for &quot;mimic&quot; and the specific &quot;polyglottos&quot;, is from Ancient Greek , &quot;harmonious&quot;, from &quot;polus&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, and &quot;glossa&quot;, &quot;tongue&quot;, representing its outstanding ability to mimic various sounds. The northern mockingbird is considered to be conspecific with the tropical mockingbird (&quot;Mimus gilvus&quot;).

This species is categorized as the northern mockingbird as the closest living relative to &quot;M. gilvus&quot;.

===Subspecies===
There are three recognized subspecies for the northern mockingbird. There have been proposed races from the Bahamas and Haiti placed under the &quot;orpheus&quot; section.

*&quot;M. p. polyglottos&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758): generally found in the eastern portion of North America ranging from Nova Scotia to Nebraska, to as far south as Texas and Florida.
*&quot;M. p. leucopterus&quot;, the western mockingbird (Vigors, 1839): generally found in the western portion of North America ranging from northwestern Nebraska and western Texas to the Pacific coast, and south to Mexico (the Isthmus of Tehuantepec), and Socorro Island. It is larger than &quot;M. p. polyglottos&quot; and has a slightly shorter tail, upperparts are more buff and paler, underparts have a stronger buff pigment.
*&quot;M. p. orpheus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) from the Bahamas to the Greater Antilles, also the Cayman and Virgin Islands. Similar to &quot;M. m. polyglottos&quot; except smaller, a paler shade of gray on its back, and underparts with practically little, if any buff at all.

==Description==
The northern mockingbird is a medium-sized mimid that has long legs and tail. Males and females look alike. Its upper parts are colored gray, while its underparts have a white or whitish-gray color.
It has parallel wing bars on the half of the wings connected near the white patch giving it a distinctive appearance in flight. The black central rectrices and typical white lateral rectrices are also noticeable in flight. The iris is usually a light green-yellow or a yellow, but there have been instances of an orange color. The bill is black with a brownish black appearance at the base. The juvenile appearance is marked by its streaks on its back, distinguished spots and streaks on its chest, and a gray or grayish-green iris.

Northern mockingbirds measure from including a tail almost as long as its body. The wingspan can range from and body mass is from . Males tend to be slightly larger than females. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is and the tarsus is .

The northern mockingbird&#x27;s lifespan is observed to be up to 8 years, but captive birds can live up to 20 years.

==Distribution and habitat==
The mockingbird&#x27;s breeding range is from the Maritime provinces westwards to British Columbia, practically the entire continental United States south of the northern Plains states and Pacific Northwest, the Greater Antilles, and the majority of Mexico to eastern Oaxaca and Veracruz. The mockingbird is generally a year-round resident of its range, but the birds that live in the northern portion of its range have been noted farther south during the winter season. Sightings of the mockingbird have also been recorded in Hawaii (where it was introduced in the 1920s), southeastern Alaska, and three times as transatlantic vagrants in Britain, most recently in Exmouth, Devon, UK in February and March 2021. The mockingbird is thought to be at least partly migratory in the northern portions of its range, but the migratory behavior is not well understood.
In the 19th century, the range of the mockingbird expanded northward towards provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario and states such as Massachusetts, although the sightings were sporadic. Within the first five decades of the 20th century, regions that received an influx of mockingbirds were Maine, Vermont, Ohio, Iowa, and New York. In western states such as California, the population was restricted to the Lower Sonoran Desert regions but by the 1970s the mockingbird was residential in most counties. Islands that saw introductions of the mockingbird include Bermuda (in which it failed), Barbados, St. Helena, Socorro Island, the Cayman Islands and Tahiti.

The mockingbird&#x27;s habitat varies by location, but it prefers open areas with sparse vegetation. In the eastern regions, suburban and urban areas such as parks and gardens are frequent residential areas. It has an affinity for mowed lawns with shrubs within proximity for shade and nesting. In western regions, desert scrub and chaparral are among its preferred habitats. When foraging for food, it prefers short grass. This bird does not nest in densely forested areas, and generally resides in the same habitats year round.

==Behavior==
===Diet===

The northern mockingbird is an omnivore. The birds&#x27; diet consists of arthropods (such as spiders, grasshoppers, wasps, bees, ants, beetles, butterflies, and caterpillars), earthworms, berries, fruits, seeds, and occasionally flowers, small crustaceans, and lizards (&quot;Anolis&quot; spp.). Mockingbirds can drink from puddles, river and lake edges, or dew and rain droplets that amass onto plants. Adult mockingbirds also have been seen drinking sap from the cuts on recently pruned trees. Its diet heavily consists of animal prey during the breeding season, but takes a drastic shift to fruits during the fall and winter. The drive for fruits amid winter has been noted for the geographic expansion of the mockingbird, and in particular, the fruit of &quot;Rosa multiflora&quot;, a favorite of the birds, is a possible link. Mockingbirds also eat garden fruits such as tomatoes, apples, and berries (like blackberries, raspberries, other bramble fruits, holly berries, mulberries, and dogwood), as well as grapes and figs.

These birds forage on the ground or in vegetation; they also fly down from a perch to capture food. While foraging, they frequently spread their wings in a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior, with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey.

===Breeding===


Both the male and female of the species reach sexual maturity after one year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. The males arrive before the beginning of the season to establish their territories. They may demonstrate or contest the edges of a territory using a boundary dance in which males, typically on the ground, face each other and hop side to side, sometimes fighting, until one flies away. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during a single bird&#x27;s lifetime.

Both the male and female are involved in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both the male and female will feed the chicks.

The birds aggressively defend their nests and surrounding areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls to join the defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds drive away the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that they consider a threat, mockingbirds will at times target humans. The birds are bold, and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted in the distribution of a warning letter to residents.

The northern mockingbird pairs hatch about two to four broods a year. In one breeding attempt, the northern mockingbird lays an average of four eggs. They are pale blue or greenish white with red or brown blotches, and measure about . They hatch after about 11 to 14 days of incubation by the female. After about 10 to 15 days of life, the offspring become independent.

====Sexual selection====
Northern mockingbirds are famous for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the beginning of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males are also more likely to use elevated perches to make their songs audible farther away. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.

An observational study by Logan demonstrates that the female is continuously evaluating the quality of the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory at the beginning of a new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male&#x27;s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Separation, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.

====Sex allocation====
Northern mockingbirds adjust the sex ratio of their offspring according to the food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex at the beginning of a breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.

====Mating====
Northern mockingbirds are socially monogamous. The sexes look alike except that the male is slightly larger than the female. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders have the option of changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.

====Parental care====
Northern mockingbirds are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, they are born relatively immobile and defenseless and therefore require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch but there is no increase during the egg stage.

A recent study shows that both food availability and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time to care for the nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.

Mockingbird nests are also often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents are found to reject parasitic eggs at an intermediate rate. A recent study has shown that foreign eggs are more likely to be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.

====Ontogeny====
A laboratory observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings (thirty-five and three, respectively) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds. Notable milestones, including the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, begging, and preening, began within the first six days of life. Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, and leaving the nest happened within seventeen days (nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days). Improvements of flight, walking and self-feeding took place within forty days. Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages, to the extent that one of two siblings living in the same area was likely killed by the other.

===Song and calls===

Although many species of bird imitate the vocalizations of other birds, the northern mockingbird is the species best known in North America for doing so. Among the vocalizations it imitates are songs of the Carolina wren, northern cardinal, tufted titmouse, eastern towhee, house sparrow, wood thrush, and eastern bluebird, calls of the northern flicker and great crested flycatcher, &quot;jeers&quot; and &quot;pumphandles&quot; of the blue jay, and alarms, &quot;chups&quot;, and &quot;chirrs&quot; of the American robin. It imitates not only birds, but also other animals such as cats, dogs, frogs, and crickets and sounds from artificial items such as unoiled wheels and even car alarms. As convincing as these imitations may be to humans, they often fail to fool other birds, such as the Florida scrub jay.

The northern mockingbird&#x27;s mimicry is likely to serve as a form of sexual selection through which competition between males and female choice influence a bird&#x27;s song repertoire size. A 2013 study attempted to determine model selection in vocal mimics, and the data suggested that mimicry in the mockingbird resulted from the bird being genetically predisposed to learning vocalizations with acoustic characteristics such as an enlarged auditory template.

Both male and female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being generally quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less often in the summer and fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its repertoire during its life, though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher.

There are four recognized calls for the mockingbird: the &quot;nest relief call&quot;, &quot;hew call&quot;, &quot;chat or chatburst&quot;, and the &quot;begging call&quot;. The &quot;hew&quot; call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators, conspecific chasing, and various interactions between mates. One difference between &quot;chats&quot; and &quot;chatbursts&quot; is frequency of use, as &quot;chats&quot; are year-round and &quot;chatbursts&quot; occur in the fall. Another difference is that &quot;chatbursts&quot; appear to be used in territorial defense in the fall and &quot;chats&quot; are used by either sex when disturbed. The &quot;nest relief&quot; and &quot;begging calls&quot; are only used by the males.

==Predation and threats==


Adult mockingbirds can fall victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, bald eagle, golden eagle, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their tenacious behavior makes them less likely to be captured. Scrub jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledglings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows, American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; have been found in Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.

Winter storms limit the expansion of mockingbirds in their range. The storms have played a role in the declining of the populations in Ohio (where it has since recovered), Michigan, Minnesota and likely in Quebec. Dry seasons also affect the mockingbird populations in Arizona.

==Intelligence==
In a paper published in 2009, researchers found that mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds&#x27; nest. Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals. A similar paper published in 2023 had several participants exhibit varying levels of threatening behavior towards nesting mockingbirds. During a three-day training period, &quot;high threat&quot; participants were instructed to touch the nest daily while accompanied by a &quot;medium threat&quot; participant who stood three meters away. &quot;Low threat&quot; participants approached the nest separately and also stood three meters away for 10 minutes. When flushed from their nests by participants during a testing period, the mockingbirds retreated further from individuals who had exhibited more threatening behavior during the training period.

===Adaptation to urban habitats===
The northern mockingbird is a species that is found in both urban and rural habitats. There are now more northern mockingbirds living in urban habitats than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species. Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs may account for the higher mortality rate in rural habitats. Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from falling into ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night, in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas. The adaptation of the mockingbird in urban habitats has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.

==In culture==
This bird features in the title and central metaphor of the 1960 novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, by Harper Lee. In that novel, mockingbirds are portrayed as innocent and generous, and two of the major characters, Atticus Finch and Miss Maudie, say it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because &quot;they don&#x27;t do one thing for us but make music for us to enjoy. They don&#x27;t eat up people&#x27;s gardens, don&#x27;t nest in corncribs, they don&#x27;t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.&quot;

&quot;The Hunger Games&quot; franchise depicts &quot;mockingjays,&quot; mockingbirds hybridized with jabberjays, genetically engineered birds which could memorize and repeat entire human conversations. These birds appear throughout the series as a rebellious symbol.

The traditional lullaby &quot;Hush Little Baby&quot; has a line that goes &quot;Papa&#x27;s gonna buy you a mockingbird&quot;.

The song of the northern mockingbird inspired many American folk songs of the mid-19th century, such as &quot;Listen to the Mocking Bird&quot;.

Thomas Jefferson had several pet mockingbirds, including a bird named &quot;Dick&quot;.

In the fictional Neighborhood of Make-Believe on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, one of King Friday&#x27;s &quot;pets&quot; is a wooden northern mockingbird on a stick, which he refers to by the scientific name &quot;Mimus polyglottos&quot;.

In 1951, Patti Page, a popular vocalist, recorded &quot;Mockin&#x27; Bird Hill&quot;, which was sold in 10&quot; 78 RPM format. The song reached #2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop music chart and reflected gentle postwar values of the period.

==State bird==
The northern mockingbird is the state bird of Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas, and previously the state bird of South Carolina.
