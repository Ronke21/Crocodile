<text>Ataxx (アタックス) is a strategy video game published in arcades by Leland Corporation in 1990. Two players compete on a seven-by-seven square grid. The object of the game is for a player to have a majority of the pieces on the board at the end, by converting as many of their opponent&#x27;s pieces as possible. In a single-player game, the opponents are &quot;bio-invaders from a different dimension.&quot;

The concept was invented earlier by Dave Crummack and Craig Galley for the unreleased 1988 video game &quot;Infection&quot;. Virgin Mastertronic licensed it to Leland as well as using the design in its own &quot;&quot; released the same year as &quot;Ataxx&quot;. There are numerous independently developed clones. Although &quot;Ataxx&quot; was sold as a video game and not with a physical game board, it can be played with a Reversi set.

== Gameplay ==
Each player begins with two pieces, red and blue, for the first player and second player respectively. The game starts with the four pieces on the four corners of the board, with red in the top left and bottom right and blue on the other two. Red moves first.

During their turn, players move one of their pieces either one or two spaces in any direction. Diagonal distances are equivalent to orthogonal distances, i.e. it is legal to move to a square whose relative position is two squares away both vertically and horizontally. If the destination is adjacent to the source, a new piece is created on the empty departure square. Otherwise the piece on the source moves to the destination. After the move, all of the opponent player&#x27;s pieces adjacent to the destination square are converted to the color of the moving player. Players must move unless no legal move is possible, in which case they must pass.

The game ends when all squares have been filled or one of the players has no remaining pieces. The player with the most pieces wins. A draw may occur when the number of squares is even, either from non-playable squares or nonstandard sizes having an even number of squares. Some versions also implement the threefold repetition rule from chess.

The game is timed, similarly to blitz chess. Each player&#x27;s timer counts down while it is their turn to move; they lose if it reaches zero, but may buy more time (100 seconds per quarter) while the game is in progress. After completing a game (whether they won or lost), a player may choose whether or not to play another game with the time remaining.

== Development==
Originally called &quot;Infection&quot;, the game was invented by Dave Crummack and Craig Galley in 1988 for Wise Owl Software, which then sold the rights to Virgin Mastertronic UK. Although versions of &quot;Infection&quot; were programmed for Amiga, Commodore 64, and Atari ST, none saw a commercial release. Eventually, the game was picked up by Virgin Mastertronic US, which licensed it to the Leland corporation, who then released it as the arcade game &quot;Ataxx&quot; in 1990. Around the same time, Virgin released its own version of the game, &quot;&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System, IBM PC compatibles, Game Boy, and Commodore 64, based on Cool Spot, a character from a 7 Up marketing campaign of the time.

==Reception==
== Legacy ==
In 1993, Virgin released the Trilobyte-produced game &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, which contains a version of &quot;Ataxx&quot; as its Microscope Puzzle. Graeme Devine of Trilobyte, co-creator of &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, had overseen the production of &quot;Spot: The Video Game&quot; while working at Virgin. In April 2011, an updated version of the Microscope Puzzle was released as a stand-alone app for iPad under the title &quot;The 7th Guest: Infection&quot;.

&quot;Hexxagōn&quot;, an IBM PC compatible game created by Argo Games and published by Software Creations in 1993, uses a hexagonal board, as does the 1995 sequel to &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;. &quot;Hexxagōn&quot; would later be adapted into a Flash-based game programmed by Paul Neave for the Neave Interactive website.

&quot;Boogers&quot; is an online 4-player variation hosted by the ImagiNation Network, a pre-internet dial-up game network. Two to four players fight on a 9x9 board.

The Sierra educational game &quot;Mega Math&quot; includes a clone of &quot;Ataxx&quot; where the player must answer math questions in order to move.

Many independently developed games have borrowed the &quot;Ataxx&quot; concept.

<doc id="382576" wikidata="Q319682" url="?curid=382576" title="Louis B. Mayer">
<text>Louis Burt Mayer (; born Lazar Meir; July 12, 1884 – October 29, 1957) was a Canadian-American film producer and co-founder of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios (MGM) in 1924. Under Mayer&#x27;s management, MGM became the film industry&#x27;s most prestigious movie studio, accumulating the largest concentration of leading writers, directors, and stars in Hollywood.

Mayer was born in the village of Dymer, in what is now Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire), and grew up poor in Saint John, New Brunswick. He quit school at 12 to support his family and later moved to Boston and purchased and renovated a small vaudeville theatre in Haverhill, Massachusetts. He renovated and expanded several other theatres in the Boston area catering to audiences of higher social classes. After expanding and moving to Los Angeles, he teamed with film producer Irving Thalberg and they developed hundreds of films. Mayer handled the business of running the studio, such as setting budgets and approving new productions, while Thalberg, still in his twenties, supervised all MGM productions.

Mayer claimed to believe in &quot;wholesome entertainment&quot; and went to great lengths to discover new actors and develop them into major stars. During his long reign at MGM, Mayer acquired many critics and supporters. Some stars did not appreciate his attempts to control their private lives, while others saw him as a concerned father figure. He was controversial for his treatment of the actors under his management, demanding compliance from female stars by threatening their livelihoods, such as in the case of Judy Garland, whom he forced to go on diets, take drugs, and work punishing schedules.

Mayer was forced to resign as MGM&#x27;s vice president in 1951, when the studio&#x27;s parent company, Loew&#x27;s, Inc., wanted to improve declining profits. A staunch conservative, Mayer at one time was the chairman of the California Republican Party. In 1927, he was one of the founders of AMPAS, famous for its annual Academy Awards.

==Early life==
Mayer preferred to say that he was born in Minsk. Bosley Crowther, in an early biography, gave his birthplace as &quot;a little town near Minsk&quot;. Other sources cite such places as Demre and Dmra, &quot;a village between Minsk and Vilnius&quot;. Charles Higham and Scott Eyman state that Mayer was born in Dymer near Kyiv in Ukraine; this accords with what Mayer himself stated in his naturalization filing in 1912, where he gave his birthplace as Dumier, Russia. Andrzej Krakowski has suggested that the birthplace has been misinterpreted and Mayer was in fact from the town of Mińsk Mazowiecki in eastern Poland, which at the time was subjugated by the Russian Empire.

According to his personal details in the U.S. immigration documents, the date was July 4, 1885. In addition he gave his birth year as 1882 in his marriage certificate while the April 1910 census states his age as 26 (b.1883). His parents were Jacob and Sarah (née Meltzer) Meir (both Jewish) and he had two sisters — Yetta, born ca. 1878 and Ida, born ca. 1883. Mayer first moved with his family to Long Island, where they lived from 1887 to 1892 and where his two brothers were born—Rubin, in April 1888 and Jeremiah, in April 1891. Then, they moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where Mayer attended school.

His father started a scrap metal business, J. Mayer &amp; Son. An immigrant unskilled in any trade, he struggled to earn a living. Young Louis quit school at age twelve to work with his father and help support his family. He roamed the streets with a cart that said &quot;Junk Dealer&quot; and collected any scrap metal he came across. When the owner of a tin business, John Wilson, saw him with his cart, he began giving him copper trimmings which were of no use and Mayer considered Wilson to be his first partner and his best friend. Wilson remembered that he was impressed with the boy&#x27;s good manners and bright personality. Whenever Mayer visited Saint John in later years, he placed flowers on Wilson&#x27;s grave, just as he did on his mother&#x27;s.

&quot;It was a crappy childhood&quot;, said Mayer&#x27;s nephew Gerald. His family was poor and Mayer&#x27;s father spoke little English and had no valuable skills. It thus became young Mayer&#x27;s ambition and drive that supported the family. With his family speaking mostly Yiddish at home, his goal of self-education when he quit school was made more difficult.

In his spare time, he hung around the York Theatre, sometimes paying to watch the live vaudeville shows. He became enamored of the entertainment business. Then in 1904 the 20-year-old Mayer left Saint John for Boston, where he continued for a time in the scrap metal business, got married and took a variety of odd jobs to support his new family when his junk business lagged.

==Early career==
Mayer renovated the Gem Theater, a rundown, 600 seat burlesque house
in Haverhill, Massachusetts, which he reopened on November 28, 1907, as the Orpheum, his first movie theater. To overcome an unfavorable reputation that the building had, Mayer opened with a religious film at his new Orpheum, &quot;From the Manger to the Cross&quot;, in 1912. Within a few years, he owned all five of Haverhill&#x27;s theaters, and, with Nathan H. Gordon, created the Gordon-Mayer partnership that controlled the largest theater chain in New England. During his years in Haverhill, Mayer lived at 16 Middlesex St. in the city&#x27;s Bradford section, closer to city center at Temple Street and at 2 1/2 Merrimac St. Mayer also lived in a house he built at 27 Hamilton Ave.

In 1914, the partners organized their own film distribution agency in Boston. Mayer paid D.W. Griffith $25,000 for the exclusive rights to show &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915) in New England. Mayer made the bid on a film that one of his scouts had seen, but he had not, although he was well aware of the plot surrounding the Ku Klux Klan; his decision netted him over $100,000. Using earnings from the popularity of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, Mayer partnered with Richard A. Rowland in 1916 to create Metro Pictures Corporation, a talent booking agency, in New York City.

Two years later, Mayer moved to Los Angeles and formed his own production company, Louis B. Mayer Pictures Corporation. The first production was 1918&#x27;s &quot;Virtuous Wives&quot;. A partnership was set up with B. P. Schulberg to make the Mayer-Schulberg Studio

In late 1922, Mayer was introduced to Irving Thalberg, then working for Universal Pictures. Mayer was searching for someone to help him manage his small, but dynamic and fast-growing studio. At that first meeting, Thalberg made an immediate positive impression on Mayer, writes biographer Roland Flamini. Later that evening, after Thalberg had left, Mayer told the studio&#x27;s attorney, Edwin Loeb, to let Thalberg know that if he wanted to work for Mayer, he would be treated like a son.

Although their personalities were in many ways opposite, Mayer being more outspoken and nearly twice the younger man&#x27;s age, Thalberg was hired as vice president in charge of production at Louis B. Mayer Productions. Years later, Mayer&#x27;s daughter, Irene Mayer Selznick, found it hard to believe that anyone &quot;so boyish could be so important&quot;. According to Flamini, Thalberg was hired because, although Mayer was an astute businessman, he lacked Thalberg&#x27;s strong ability to combine making films of quality with gaining commercial success.

==Heading new Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios==

Mayer&#x27;s big breakthrough was in April 1924 when his company subsequently merged with two others to become Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The 24-year-old Thalberg was made part-owner and accorded the same position as vice president in charge of production.

Marcus Loew, owner of the Loew&#x27;s chain, merged Metro Pictures, Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, and Mayer Pictures into Metro-Goldwyn. Loew had bought Metro and Goldwyn some months before, but could not find anyone to oversee his new holdings on the West Coast. Mayer, with his proven success as a producer, was an obvious choice. He was named head of studio operations and a Loew&#x27;s vice president, based in Los Angeles, reporting to Loew&#x27;s longtime right-hand man Nicholas Schenck. He would hold this post for the next 27 years. Before the year was out, Mayer added his name to the studio with Loew&#x27;s blessing, renaming it Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Three years after the merger, MGM became the most successful studio in Hollywood.

Loew died in 1927, and Schenck became president of Loew&#x27;s. Mayer and Schenck hated each other intensely; Mayer reportedly referred to his boss, whose name was pronounced &quot;Skenk&quot;, as &quot;Mr. Skunk&quot; in private. Two years later, Schenck agreed to sell Loew&#x27;s – and MGM – to William Fox, which angered Mayer. But despite his important role in MGM, Mayer was not a shareholder, and had no standing to challenge the sale. So he instead used his Washington connections to persuade the Justice Department to delay the merger on antitrust grounds. During the summer of 1929, Fox was severely injured in an auto accident. By the time he recovered, the stock market crash had wiped out his fortune, destroying any chance of the deal going through even if the Justice Department had lifted its objections. Nonetheless, Schenck believed Mayer had cost him a fortune and never forgave him, causing an already frigid relationship to become even worse.

===Working with Irving Thalberg===

Mayer and Thalberg were a brilliant team that worked well together. They relied on each other, and neither operated unilaterally. Mayer took charge of the business part of running the studio, such as setting budgets and approving new productions. Thalberg, eventually called the &quot;boy wonder&quot;, took charge of all MGM productions. Director Joseph M. Newman said that their skills complemented each other well, with Thalberg having a great story mind, and Mayer having superior business acumen.

They shared a guiding philosophy, to make the best motion pictures they could at any cost, even if it meant reshooting the entire picture. More important than showing a consistent profit with their films was, for them, to see MGM become a high-quality studio. That goal began with their early silent films, when stars such as Greta Garbo, Mayer&#x27;s discovery, acted in lush settings with spectacular camera work.

Although they initially got along well, their relationship frayed over philosophical differences. Thalberg preferred literary works over the crowd-pleasers Mayer wanted. He ousted Thalberg as production chief in 1932, while Thalberg was recovering from a heart attack, and replaced him with producer David O. Selznick.

But MGM received a serious blow when Thalberg died suddenly on September 14, 1936, at age 37. His death came as a shock to Mayer and everyone at MGM and the other studios. Mayer issued statements to the press, calling Thalberg &quot;the finest friend a man could ever have ... the guiding inspiration behind the artistic progress on the screen.&quot; His funeral was a major news event in Los Angeles. All the studios observed five minutes of silence, while MGM closed its studio for the entire day.

Mayer dedicated MGM&#x27;s front office building and christened it the Thalberg Building. He had the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences establish the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, given to producers to recognize their exceptional careers, now considered one of the most prestigious awards in the Hollywood film industry.

===Continued success after Thalberg&#x27;s death===
After Thalberg died, many in Hollywood expected Mayer to &quot;stumble and fall&quot;. Director Joseph M. Newman saw the studio start to change for the worse. Some actors were affected, such as Luise Rainer, winner of Hollywood&#x27;s first back-to-back Oscars, who felt that the death of Thalberg marked the death of her career: &quot;Had it not been that he died, I think I may have stayed much longer in films.&quot; Joan Crawford was also concerned, feeling that with Thalberg gone, the concept of the quality &quot;big&quot; picture &quot;pretty much went out the window&quot;.

However, MGM under Mayer&#x27;s leadership continued to produce successful movies. Mayer made himself head of production as well as studio chief. For the next ten years, MGM grew and thrived. 1939 was an especially &quot;golden&quot; year: besides distributing &quot;Gone with the Wind,&quot; MGM released &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; &quot;Babes in Arms,&quot; &quot;At the Circus,&quot; and &quot;The Women&quot;. Garbo laughed in &quot;Ninotchka;&quot; &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; won an Oscar (it was nominated for seven); and Hedy Lamarr, another of Mayer&#x27;s personal discoveries, made her film debut.

Mayer became the first person in American history to earn a million-dollar salary. For nine years from 1937, when he earned $1,300,000 (equivalent to $ today) Mayer was the highest-paid man in the United States.

==Managing MGM==

===Management style===
In his overall management skills, Mayer was considered a great executive, someone who could have run General Motors equally as well as a large studio like MGM, said producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz. He worked at the studio all the time, and decisively, without any fixed schedule, but disliked paperwork. Some said Mayer had a lot in common with newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. Hearst had financed multiple MGM pictures, while MGM benefited by having film reviews included nationwide in the Hearst newspapers.

Hearst, 20 years Mayer&#x27;s senior, affectionately referred to Mayer as &quot;son&quot; and they became good friends. Mayer took Hearst&#x27;s suggestion to build himself an office bungalow on the MGM lot, something Hearst said was appropriate for a studio head: &quot;Everybody of distinction from all over the world comes to Los Angeles and everybody who comes wants to see your studio and they all want to meet you and do meet you, so put on a few airs son, and provide the atmosphere.&quot; Director Clarence Brown pointed out that overall, Mayer&#x27;s skill was similar to Hearst&#x27;s in that they both learned by doing. What Mayer couldn&#x27;t do on his own, he hired the best talent he could find to do for him. &quot;Like Hearst and Henry Ford,&quot; said Brown, &quot;he was an executive genius&quot;.

Mayer&#x27;s temper was widely known, but most people knew that his sudden bursts of anger faded quickly. With those working underneath him, he was usually patient and preferred to leave department heads alone, and would fire executives if they failed to produce successful films over a long period.

===Growth of the studio===
At its peak in the 1940s, MGM employed six thousand people, had three entrances, and covered 185 acres in Culver City, California, outside of Los Angeles. It had forty cameras and sixty sound machines, used on its six separate lots, and connected with its own rail line. About 2,700 people ate in the commissary every day. Power was supplied by an in-house electrical plant which could light a town of 25,000. In addition, MGM maintained a police force of fifty officers—larger than that of Culver City itself. &quot;Anywhere from sixteen to eighteen pictures were being shot at one time&quot;, remembers actress Ann Rutherford. &quot;They were either shooting or preparing to shoot on every sound stage.&quot;

===Creating a &quot;star system&quot;===
Mayer helped create what is termed the &quot;star system&quot;. At one point he explained the process he went through in creating a star:
===Hiring actors and staff===

During MGM&#x27;s growth period, Mayer traveled often, and among his personal discoveries were Greta Garbo, Hedy Lamarr, Norma Shearer and Greer Garson. He also signed up dancing team Marge and Gower Champion and discovered Mario Lanza, then a young tenor from Philadelphia, who Mayer hoped to turn into a &quot;singing Clark Gable&quot;.

When hiring new actors, he typically wanted them to agree to stay with the studio for either three or seven years, during which time they would become one of the MGM &quot;family&quot;. The studio usually succeeded in hiring those it wanted since they offered the highest salaries. With executives, Mayer took more time before taking them, wanting to know them first on a personal level. He respected intelligence and talent overall, said manager Joe Cohn: &quot;One time he said to me, &#x27;Never be afraid of hiring a fellow smarter than you are. You&#x27;ll only learn from them.&#x27;&quot;

Mayer took pride in his ability to hire good people, and once hired, he left them alone to do their job without interference. That policy held true whether the person was a producer, a department head or simply a janitor. As a result, while other studios went through continuous upheavals or reorganizations, Mayer&#x27;s hands-off policy kept MGM stable and sound, where employees felt their jobs were secure.&quot;

When meeting a new employee, he always told them to come to him personally for help with any problems. Some, like Barbara Stanwyck, considered this attitude to be &quot;pompous&quot; however, since he used his position to meddle in people&#x27;s lives. Others, such as actor Edward G. Robinson, after his first meeting Mayer, said &quot;I found him to be a man of truth ... Behind his gutta-percha face and roly-poly figure, it was evident there was a man of steel—but well-mannered steel.&quot; British director Victor Saville remembered him as being &quot;the best listener. He wanted to know. He was the devil&#x27;s advocate. He would prod you and question you and suck you dry of any knowledge.&quot;

===Working with studio people===
His attitude and conversational style were both professional and animated, sometimes &quot;theatrical&quot;, observed June Caldwell, secretary to Eddie Mannix, Mayer&#x27;s assistant. &quot;Bombastic and colorful, but I never heard him use nasty language ... he had a great loyalty to everybody, and everybody respected him. And he would listen ... You could work with him.&quot; His manners were considered &quot;impeccable&quot;.

With MGM&#x27;s film output as high as one film each week, he never panicked over a bad picture. If somebody suggested canceling a movie and cutting the studio&#x27;s losses, when a film had consistent production problems, Mayer would typically refuse. He relied on his instinct and intuition, said actress Esther Williams. Although he did not read full scripts, if he was given the framework of a story, he could assemble the pieces needed to see if it could be a successful film.

Occasionally, when producers, directors, writers or actors were deadlocked over how to handle a problem in a film, he would mediate. On &quot;Rosalie&quot;, for instance, when Nelson Eddy refused to sing a song he thought was too melodramatic, its songwriter, Cole Porter, went to Mayer and played it for him. Mayer was moved to tears by the song, and told Eddy to sing it. &quot;Imagine making Louis B. Mayer cry,&quot; Porter later told friends.

===Response to technical innovations===
With regard to any technical issues with productions, Mayer left the details and solutions to MGM&#x27;s engineers. He, though, like other top film executives and Hollywood stars in the 1920s and early 1930s, was often too quick to dismiss news of inventions and major innovations on the horizon that might profoundly change the movie industry or possibly challenge in the future the growing dominance of films in the realm of American entertainment. Beyond the well-entrenched aspect of sound by 1932, other technologies being discussed at that time in newspapers and on studio lots included color features, widescreen formatting, and even early television. In August 1932, after an &quot;exclusive&quot; interview with Mayer in New York, &quot;The Film Daily&quot; reported the movie mogul&#x27;s assertions that such potential developments would never impact motion pictures in substantial, meaningful ways:
===Being a father figure===
With many of his actors, Mayer was like an overprotective father. In some cases, especially with child actors, he could become closely involved in managing their everyday lives, telling them where to shop, where to dine, or what doctor to visit. He liked giving suggestions about how they could take better care of themselves. He sometimes arranged marriages, and coping with occupational hazards such as alcoholism, suicide, and eccentric sexual habits were as much a part of his job as negotiating contracts with stars and directors. When he learned that June Allyson was dating David Rose, for instance, he told her to stop seeing him: &quot;If you care about your reputation, you cannot be seen with a married man.&quot;

Stories about his sobbing or rages have often been repeated in books, but few employees ever saw that part of him. &quot;Mr. Mayer was to me like a father&quot;, said Ricardo Montalbán. &quot;He really thought of the people under contract as his boys and girls.&quot; Mayer&#x27;s paternalism could extend to productions; for example, he revised the &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; stories in order to keep an ailing Lionel Barrymore, who required the use of a wheelchair due to arthritis, on the job.

Some, such as young starlet Elizabeth Taylor, disliked Mayer overseeing their lives; Taylor called him a &quot;monster&quot;, while Mickey Rooney, another young actor who co-starred with Taylor when she was 12, formed the opposite impression: &quot;He was the daddy of everybody and vitally interested in everybody. They always talk badly about Mayer, but he was really a wonderful guy ... he listened and you listened.&quot; Rooney spoke from experience, as he himself had some confrontations with Mayer, observed film historian Jane Ellen Wayne:

One of Rooney&#x27;s repeat costars in &quot;Andy Hardy&quot; and other films was Judy Garland, with whom he made nine films. Garland stated in her unfinished autobiography that Mayer molested her. In the late 1940s, she began having personal problems, which affected her acting, and Mayer tried his best to protect her star reputation while keeping her overworked and making money for MGM. She suffered from addictions to prescription drugs, severe eating disorders and domestic strains, as well as a multitude of issues with her mental health. This was largely the result of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, her mother, and the era&#x27;s ignorance of diet and drugs. When her absences caused the production of &quot;Summer Stock&quot; to go far over budget, producer Joe Pasternak suggested that Mayer cut his losses and cancel the picture. Mayer refused, telling him, &quot;Judy Garland has made this studio a fortune in the good days, and the least we can do is to give her one more chance. If you stop production now, it&#x27;ll finish her&quot;, in what some consider to be his last attempt at holding on to her fame for the benefit of the studio. She completed the film, but during her next picture, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, the studio finally ran out of patience. Costar Howard Keel recalls that &quot;she began to fall apart&quot;. After the studio fired her, she attempted suicide.

===Developing child stars===
Mayer wanted the studio to nurture child stars for MGM&#x27;s family-oriented productions. The studio provided all the essential services, such as formal education and medical care. They were given acting or dancing tutors. Mayer loved children, wrote biographer Kitty Kelley: &quot;They provided the magic that brought millions of people stampeding into theaters every week ... They were the good, clean, wholesome elements of the folksy entertainment that was MGM&#x27;s specialty.&quot;

Jackie Coogan, then 11, marked the studio&#x27;s debut using child stars with his role in &quot;The Rag Man&quot; in 1925. During Hollywood&#x27;s golden age, MGM had more child actors than any other studio, including Jackie Cooper, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Freddie Bartholomew, Margaret O&#x27;Brien, Elizabeth Taylor, and Roddy McDowall.

==Themes, musicals and formula==
While MGM&#x27;s films during the 1920s and 1930s were often known for containing adult themes and strong female stars, such as Greta Garbo, after Thalberg&#x27;s early death in 1936, Mayer promoted a change in emphasis to more male leads, family themes, and child stars. And unusual for a movie mogul, he took moral positions in his movies, especially when it came to portraying family values—as in the &quot;Andy Hardy&quot; series. One of Mayer&#x27;s proudest moments came when Mickey Rooney, who starred as Andy Hardy, was given a special award by the Academy in 1942 for &quot;furthering the American way of life.&quot;

Mayer tried to express an idealized vision of men, women, and families in the real world they lived in. He also believed in beauty, glamour, and the &quot;star system&quot;. In MGM films, &quot;marriage was sacrosanct and mothers were objects of veneration&quot;. Author Peter Hay states that Mayer &quot;cherished the Puritan values of family and hard work.&quot; When he hired writers, he made those objectives clear at the outset, once telling screenwriter Frances Marion that he never wanted his own daughters or his wife to be embarrassed when watching an MGM movie. &quot;I worship good women, honorable men, and saintly mothers&quot;, he told her. Mayer was serious about that, once coming from behind his desk and knocking director Erich von Stroheim to the floor when he said that all women were whores.

Mayer knew that formula in his themes and stories usually works. He felt that the general public, especially Americans, like to see stars, spectacle, and optimism on screen, and if possible, with a little sentiment attached. They don&#x27;t like to be challenged or instructed, but comforted and entertained.

Therefore, having messages was less important to Mayer than giving his audience pure entertainment and escapism. In his screen dramas, he wanted them to be melodramatic, whereas in comedies, he often laced them with strong doses of sentimentality. &quot;He loved swaggering, charismatic hams like Lionel Barrymore and Marie Dressler&quot;, wrote Eyman.

Musicals were high on his list of preferred genres. Anxious to make more of them, on a hunch, he asked songwriter Arthur Freed to be associate producer for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. As Mayer hoped, Freed&#x27;s unit at MGM produced many films considered among the best musicals ever made: &quot;For Me and My Gal&quot;, &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;, &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;, &quot;The Pirate&quot;, &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot;, &quot;On the Town&quot;, &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, and &quot;Gigi&quot;. Mayer&#x27;s greatest contributions to posterity are said to be his musicals. Both &quot;An American in Paris&quot; and &quot;Gigi&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==World War II issues==

Unlike Charlie Chaplin, who produced &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;, the other, much larger Hollywood studios lacked the freedom to make anti-Nazi films. Mayer understood that the Germans could ban or boycott Hollywood films throughout much of Europe, with serious economic implications, since 30 to 40 percent of Hollywood&#x27;s income came from European audiences. Nevertheless, MGM produced &quot;Three Comrades&quot; in 1938, despite movie censor Joseph Breen warning Mayer that the film was &quot;a serious indictment of the German nation and people and is certain to be violently resented by the present government in that country.&quot;

After the Second World War began in Europe in September 1939, Mayer authorized the production of two anti-Nazi films, &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot; and &quot;Escape.&quot; At the same time, Warner Brothers produced &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy.&quot; The German government informed the studios that &quot;those films would be remembered by Germany &quot;when&quot; — not &quot;if&quot; — they won the war&quot;, writes Eyman. Warners had to post guards to protect the family of actor Edward G. Robinson, and the Germans threatened Mayer with a boycott of all MGM films.

From September 1939 until January 1940, all films that could be considered anti-Nazi were banned by the Hays Office. The U.S. ambassador to England, Joseph Kennedy, told the studios to stop making pro-British and anti-German films. Kennedy felt that &quot;British defeat was imminent and there was no point in America holding out alone: &#x27;With England licked, the party&#x27;s over,&#x27; said Kennedy.&quot;

Defying those pleadings, MGM produced &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;, a simple story about a family in rural England trying to get by during the early years of the war. Eddie Mannix agreed that &quot;someone should salute England. And even if we lose $100,000, that&#x27;ll be okay.&quot;
Mayer wanted British actress Greer Garson, his personal discovery, to star, but she refused to play a matronly role. Mayer implored her &quot;to have the same faith in me&quot; that he had in her. He read from the script, having her visualize the image she would present to the world, &quot;a woman who survives and endures. She was London. No, more than that, she was ... England!&quot; Garson accepted the role, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress. &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; won six Academy Awards and became the top box office hit of 1942.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill both loved the film, said historian Emily Yellin, and Roosevelt wanted prints rushed to theaters nationwide. The Voice of America radio network broadcast the minister&#x27;s speech from the film, magazines reprinted it, and it was copied onto leaflets and dropped over German-occupied countries. Churchill sent Mayer a telegram claiming that &quot;&quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; is propaganda worth 100 battleships.&quot; Bosley Crowther (1960 biographer of Mayer, below), wrote in his &quot;New York Times&quot; review that &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; was the finest film yet made about the war, &quot;and a most exalting tribute to the British.&quot;

The following year, 1943, saw the release of another Oscar-winning film, this one aimed at supporting the home front, titled &quot;The Human Comedy.&quot; It was Mayer&#x27;s personal favorite and the favorite of its director, Clarence Brown. Mayer assisted the U.S. government by producing a number of short films related to the war, and helped produce pro-American films such as &quot;Joe Smith, American,&quot; in 1942.

==Declining years at MGM==
The post-war years saw a gradual decline in profits for MGM and the other studios. The number of high-grossing films in 1947 dwindled to six, compared to twenty-two a year earlier. MGM had to let go many of its top producers and other executives. Mayer was pressured to tighten expenses by the studio&#x27;s parent company, although Mayer&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;big-picture man&quot; would make that difficult. They began looking for someone, another Thalberg, to redo the studio system.

In the interim, Mayer kept making &quot;big pictures&quot;. When RKO turned down financing of Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;State of the Union&quot; in 1948 because of its expensive budget, Mayer took on the project. He filled the cast with MGM stars including Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Van Johnson, Adolphe Menjou and Angela Lansbury, but the film only broke even. Nicholas Schenck called Mayer and insisted that he &quot;cut, cut&quot;, recalls director George Sidney. Mayer replied, &quot;A studio isn&#x27;t salami, Nick.&quot; &quot;L.B. would ask only one question: &#x27;Can you make it better?&#x27; It was all he cared about&quot;, said Sidney.

As pressure built to find a new Thalberg-style manager to handle production, Dore Schary was brought in from RKO, and began work on July 14, 1948, as vice president in charge of production, working under Mayer&#x27;s direction.

Some long-time studio executives saw this change as a sign of the eventual downfall of MGM. When she heard the news, Lillian Burns Sidney, George Sidney&#x27;s wife, marched into Mayer&#x27;s office and announced, &quot;Now you&#x27;ve done it. You&#x27;ve ruined everything.&quot; She told Mayer that she was afraid Schary would eliminate all future musicals, comedies and adventure movies, and replace them with the &quot;message&quot; movies that he preferred. She expressed her fear: &quot;They won&#x27;t have need for anybody around here. Even you! You&#x27;ll see.&quot;

By mutual consent with Loew&#x27;s, Mayer resigned from MGM in August 1951. On his final day, as he walked down a red carpet laid out in front of the Thalberg Building, executives, actors and staff lined the path and applauded him for his contributions. &quot;He was so respected,&quot; said June Caldwell, Eddie Mannix&#x27;s secretary. Many assumed that his leaving meant the end of an era. Actor Turhan Bey said, &quot;In every meaningful way, it was the end of Hollywood.&quot;

Mayer, for a period after he left MGM, tried to finance and assemble a new group of film stars and directors to produce his own films as an independent. He told the press that his films would carry on in the tradition of MGM&#x27;s previous style of film subjects.
In 1952, he became chairman of the board and the single largest shareholder in Cinerama, and had hoped to produce a property he owned, &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, in the widescreen process, but without success. He left Cinerama in 1954 when the company was sold.

==Personal life==

===Accusations of sexual abuse===
Louis B. Mayer has been accused of sexual abuse, including having groped a then-teenage Judy Garland. According to Gerald Clarke&#x27;s book &quot;Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland&quot;, Mayer &quot;held meetings with the young woman seated on his lap, his hands on her chest&quot;. In an interview with Larry King, Shirley Temple claimed that Mayer &quot;came on to&quot; her mother while at the same time, Temple was in the adjacent office of Arthur Freed, who, she claimed, disrobed before her; she proceeded to laugh until he threw her out. At the time Temple was 12 years old.

Mayer reportedly pursued Jean Howard in hopes of establishing a sexual relationship, but without success. Cari Beauchamp, author of &quot;Without Lying Down: Frances Marion and the Powerful Women of Early Hollywood&quot;, observed: &quot;Mayer chased actress Jean Howard around the room. When she said, &#x27;No way&#x27;, and went off and married Charles K. Feldman, the agent, Mayer banned Charlie from the lot. For a long time after, he wouldn&#x27;t allow any of Feldman&#x27;s clients to work at MGM.&quot; In her autobiography, Esther Ralston recorded that her career was sabotaged by Mayer when she refused to sleep with him.

===Family===
Mayer had two daughters from his first marriage to Margaret Shenberg (1883–1955), which ended in divorce in 1947. The elder of these, Edith (Edie) Mayer (1905–1988), whom he would later become estranged from and disinherit, married producer William Goetz (who served as vice president for Twentieth-Century Fox and later became president of Universal-International). The younger, Irene (1907–1990), was the first wife of producer David O. Selznick and became a successful theatrical producer. In 1948, Mayer married former actress Lorena Layson Danker (1907–1985).

At home, Mayer was boss. &quot;In our family, all the basic decisions were made by him&quot;, remembers his nephew, Gerald Mayer. &quot;He was a giant. ... Were we afraid of him? Jesus Christ, yes!&quot; And although he never spoke Yiddish at the office, he sometimes spoke Yiddish with &quot;some of the relatives&quot;, said his daughter Irene.

Mayer&#x27;s activities for the Jewish Home for the Aged led to a strong friendship with Edgar Magnin, the rabbi at the Wilshire Temple in Los Angeles. &quot;Edgar and Louis B. virtually built that temple&quot;, said Herbert Brin.

===Entertainment and leisure===
At his home on Saint Cloud Road in the East Gate Bel Air neighborhood, Sundays were reserved for brunches in what was an open house, which often included visiting statesmen or former U.S. presidents, along with various producers, directors or stars. There would be a buffet supper, drinks, and later a movie. Mayer drank almost no alcohol, cared nothing for fine cuisine, and did not gamble, but might play penny-ante card games for fun.

For leisure activities, he liked going to the Hollywood Bowl, especially the annual John Philip Sousa concert. Sousa&#x27;s patriotic-style music built up his pride in America, and he &quot;would be stoked with extra exuberance for days afterward&quot;, states Eyman. Mayer also enjoyed ballet and opera, and concerts where violinist Jascha Heifetz or pianist Arthur Rubinstein performed.

While Mayer seldom discussed his early life, his partiality towards Canada would sometimes be revealed, especially after Canada entered World War II in September 1939 and the United States followed more than two years later in December 1941. On one occasion in 1943, Mary Pickford called to tell him she met a movie-struck Royal Canadian Air Force pilot from New Brunswick, where Mayer grew up. Mayer asked her to have him drop by the studio. The pilot, Charles Foster, recalled his visit: &quot;Mary&#x27;s driver took me through the gates, and I saw this little man come running down the steps of the Thalberg Building. I thought, &#x27;Oh, he&#x27;s sent a man to greet me.&#x27; And I got out of the car, and this man threw his arms around me and said, &#x27;Welcome to my studio.&#x27; &quot;

Mayer took him on a personal tour of the studio, and Foster remembers that &quot;everybody waved to him and he waved back. He spoke to people and knew them by name. I was shocked.&quot; Mayer invited him back for lunch the next day. But before Foster arrived, Mayer had invited every Canadian in Hollywood to meet the flier, including Fay Wray, Walter Pidgeon, Raymond Massey, Jack Carson, Rod Cameron, Deanna Durbin, Walter Huston, Ann Rutherford, and even his main competitor, Jack Warner. Mayer told him, &quot;When this war is over, if you want to come back here, I&#x27;ll find a job for you.&quot; Foster said &quot;It was like he was the father I never knew.&quot;

===Politics===
Active in Republican Party politics, Mayer served as the vice chairman of the California Republican Party in 1931 and 1932, and as its state chairman in 1932 and 1933. As a delegate to the 1928 Republican National Convention in Kansas City, Mayer supported Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover of California. Mayer became friends with California Governor James Rolph Jr., &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; publisher Joseph R. Knowland, and Marshall Hale. Joseph M. Schenck was an alternate delegate at the convention. Mayer was a delegate to the 1932 Republican National Convention with fellow Californians Knowland, Rolph, and Earl Warren. Mayer endorsed President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s failed reelection bid.

During the 1934 California gubernatorial election Mayer was strongly opposed to the Democratic candidate Upton Sinclair, instead preferring the Republican Frank Merriam. Mayer&#x27;s MGM and other film studios deducted a days pay from their employees to raise an anti-Sinclair fund that amounted to $500,000. Irving Thalberg was to lead MGM&#x27;s anti-Sinclair campaign and the studio recruited Carey Wilson to create a series of anti-Sinclair propaganda films. These films, directed by Felix E. Feist, included fake newsreels of Sinclair supporters who were portrayed as bums and criminals. They were shown in Californian movie theaters, with one episode featuring hired actors as Sinclair supporters speaking with foreign accents.

Mayer was a Freemason.

===Horse racing hobby===
Mayer owned or bred a number of successful thoroughbred racehorses at his ranch in Perris, California, near Los Angeles. It was considered one of the finest racing stables in the United States and raised the standards of the California racing business. Among his horses were Your Host, sire of Kelso; the 1945 U.S. Horse of the Year, Busher; and the 1959 Preakness Stakes winner, Royal Orbit. Eventually Mayer sold off the stable, partly to finance his divorce in 1947. His 248 horses brought more than $4.4 million. In 1976, &quot;Thoroughbred of California&quot; magazine named him &quot;California Breeder of the Century&quot;.

==Death==
Mayer died of leukemia on October 29, 1957. He was buried in the Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California. His sister, Ida Mayer Cummings, and brothers Jerry and Rubin also are buried there.

==Legacy==
Mayer and his lieutenants built a company that was regarded by the public and his peers alike as the pinnacle of the movie industry. &quot;Louis B. Mayer defined MGM, just as MGM defined Hollywood, and Hollywood defined America&quot;, writes biographer Scott Eyman.

In 1951, he was given an honorary Oscar for heading MGM for over 25 years. At the event, screenwriter Charles Brackett presented the award and thanked him for guiding MGM&#x27;s &quot;production policy with foresight, aggressiveness and with a real desire for taste and quality&quot;. Mayer was also thanked for founding and developing new personalities and for bringing the Hollywood &quot;star system into full flower&quot;.

Although Mayer was often disliked and even feared by many in the studio, editor Sam Marx explains that &quot;his reputation is far worse than it should be. He had to be strong to do his job, and he couldn&#x27;t do that without making enemies.&quot; Director Clarence Brown compared him to newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst:
Mayer never wrote or directed movies, and never pretended to tell writers what to write or art directors what to design. But he understood movies and their audience. According to Eyman, &quot;Mayer&#x27;s view of America became America&#x27;s view of itself.&quot; Because of the stars, the stories, the glamour, the music, and the way they were presented, audiences the world over would often applaud the moment they saw the MGM lion. Mayer was the constant at MGM who set the tone. At Mayer&#x27;s funeral in 1957, Spencer Tracy expressed Mayer&#x27;s ambitions:

<text>The Kings River (), is a river draining the Sierra Nevada mountain range in central California in the United States. Its headwaters originate along the Sierra Crest in and around Kings Canyon National Park and form the eponymous Kings Canyon, one of the deepest river gorges in North America. The river is impounded in Pine Flat Lake before flowing into the San Joaquin Valley (the southern half of the Central Valley) southeast of Fresno. With its upper and middle course in Fresno County, the Kings River diverges into multiple branches in Kings County, with some water flowing south to the old Tulare Lake bed and the rest flowing north to the San Joaquin River. However, most of the water is consumed for irrigation well upstream of either point.

Inhabited for thousands of years by the Yokuts and other native groups, the Kings River basin once fed a vast network of seasonal wetlands around Tulare Lake that supported millions of waterfowl, fish, and game animals, in turn providing sustenance for indigenous peoples. Tulare Lake was once the largest freshwater lake in the western U.S., at the middle of an endorheic basin also fed by the Kaweah, Tule and Kern Rivers. The river was named by Gabriel Moraga, the commander of a Spanish military expedition in 1806, but it was not until California became a U.S. state in 1850 that many Europeans arrived and settled along the Kings River, driving out the area&#x27;s original inhabitants. Logging and livestock grazing inflicted significant environmental damage on the upper parts of the river system, before the federal government moved to establish national parks and preserves there.

The Kings has a long history of water development, going back to the mid-19th century when farmers made their first attempts to irrigate with Kings River water. In the early 1900s Tulare Lake and its surrounding wetlands were diked, drained and reclaimed for agriculture; the construction of Pine Flat Dam in the 1950s tamed the river&#x27;s seasonal floods. The battle for control over Kings River water produced extended conflicts, including a set of dams proposed in what would become Kings Canyon National Park. Today, the river irrigates about 1.1 million acres (4,500 km2) of some of the most productive farmland in the country, and is also used extensively for hydropower generation, and water-based and backcountry recreation.

==Course==
All three forks of the Kings River originate as snowmelt in the high Sierra Nevada mountains. The Middle and South Forks begin in Kings Canyon National Park, and join in the Monarch Wilderness (Sierra and Sequoia National Forests) to form the Kings River. The North Fork, which begins in the John Muir Wilderness of the Sierra National Forest, joins the Kings River further downstream near Pine Flat Lake, the only major reservoir on the river. Much of the upper Kings River consists of remote backcountry and wilderness areas, accessible only by non-motorized trails. The entire upper course of the Kings River is in Fresno County; in the Central Valley, the Kings River also flows through parts of Tulare County and Kings County.

===Headwaters===
The South Fork is the longest tributary of the Kings River, originating on the Sierra Crest at the far eastern edge of Kings Canyon National Park. It flows south, then flows west through the Cedar Grove section of Kings Canyon, a glacial valley with high granite cliffs and a meadow floor which has been compared in appearance to Yosemite Valley. The Middle Fork flows for through some of the park&#x27;s most difficult-to-access backcountry, including Simpson Meadow and Tehipite Valley. The South and Middle Forks converge in the Monarch Wilderness at an elevation of just outside the national park to form the Kings River in the deepest part of Kings Canyon. With Spanish Peak towering above the north side of the river, and summits as high as on the south side, Kings Canyon is both deeper and narrower than the Grand Canyon.
Below the confluence of the Middle and South Forks, the Kings River flows swiftly westward for about , carving a canyon more than deep in places. Major tributaries of the Kings River in this section include Tenmile and Mill Flat Creeks, both from the south; a dam on Tenmile Creek creates Hume Lake. Another notable feature along this area of the Kings Canyon is Garlic Falls, a tiered waterfall on a tributary of the Kings more than in height. The canyon is roadless as far as the Upper Kings Campground near Verplank Creek; below the campground the river is followed by Trimmer Springs Road.

The Kings River passes Rodgers Crossing and receives the North Fork from the right near Balch Camp. The North Fork is about long and flows mainly through the Sierra National Forest. It is dammed at Wishon Reservoir, which serves as the lower reservoir for the Helms Pumped Storage Plant, one of the biggest pumped-storage hydroelectric plants in California. The North Fork passes through several other hydro plants before it joins with the Kings River. The main Kings then flows into Pine Flat Lake, the large reservoir created by Pine Flat Dam, which can store up to of water. Constructed in 1954, Pine Flat Dam provides flood control, irrigation and hydroelectricity for the southern San Joaquin Valley.

===Lower river===
The Kings River emerges from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada near Piedra, about downstream of Pine Flat Dam. From there it flows across the gently sloping alluvial plain of the San Joaquin Valley, which today is one of the most productive agricultural regions of the United States. Here the Kings River encounters a large number of diversions that serve both irrigation and flood control purposes. Two key irrigation structures along the lower river are the Fresno Weir and People&#x27;s Weir; both divert a substantial part of the river&#x27;s flow into canals. The Kings River flows south-southwest past Sanger and Reedley, crossing briefly into northwest Tulare County before entering Kings County. At Kingsburg Cole Slough splits off to the northwest, rejoining the main stem about downstream at Laton.

About north of Lemoore the Kings River splits into a pair of distributaries, the North Fork and the South Fork (not to be confused with the North and South Forks upstream in the Sierra Nevada). The Army Weir controls the amount of water flowing into the South Fork and North Fork&#x27;s flow is controlled by Island Weir, which is adjacent to Army Weir. Fresno Slough diverges from the North Fork and flows northwest, seasonally carrying floodwaters from the Kings River to the San Joaquin River at Mendota. This is the only branch of the Kings River to reach the San Joaquin, and consequently the Pacific Ocean. The remainder of the North Fork turns south below Fresno Slough, rejoining the South Fork west of Lemoore. There is also a smaller distributary called Clark&#x27;s Fork which splits from the South Fork and enters the North Fork just above where all the forks re-join.

From there the Kings River flows due south through Kings County, past Stratford, and approaches the old Tulare Lake bed. The river terminates about northeast of Kettleman City at a junction with a canal carrying water from the Tule River. Today, the old lake bed is used for agriculture and diked to prevent flooding; floodwaters are pumped into about of evaporation basins. In most years, the dams on the Kings and other rivers flowing into Tulare Lake, and the extensive canal diversion system surrounding the lake, are sufficient to prevent flooding. However, the lake occasionally reforms in very wet years.

==Watershed and natural characteristics==
The Kings River is the largest river draining the southern Sierra Nevada. Its average annual flow of makes it larger than the Kern, Kaweah and Tule Rivers combined. Before the construction of Pine Flat Dam in 1954, the Kings River reached monthly averages as high as in May and June where it flows into the San Joaquin Valley, and averaged as low as in the driest months of September and October. After the dam was built, late spring-early summer high flows have been reduced, and late summer-autumn flows have greatly increased.

In the winter season of mid-November through April, rainstorms at lower elevations commonly flood the Kings River, although with less volume than the summer melt. Annual precipitation can be as high as in the Sierra; however, in the San Joaquin Valley the climate is semi-arid to arid with annual precipitation of , decreasing as one moves further west.

The majority of the runoff, about 71 percent, originates as snowmelt between April and July in the drainage basin above Pine Flat Dam. Three-quarters of this rugged watershed is a mile (1,600 m) or more above sea level; the watershed tops out at North Palisade, the highest point in Kings Canyon National Park. The canyons of the Kings River are relatively young in geological terms; mostly carved during the Pliocene and Pleistocene (5 million–12,000 years ago) during periods of rapid uplift in the Sierra Nevada.

During and before the Pleistocene, the upper portion of the watershed was heavily glaciated during successive ice ages, with valley glaciers flowing as much as down the river&#x27;s three forks, carving the V-shaped river canyons into the U-shaped gorges of Kings Canyon, Tehipite Valley and others. The Sierra is composed mainly of granitic igneous rock; however, in the foothill area the Kings River flows through roof pendant formations of older sedimentary and metamorphic rock which were accreted to the Sierra Nevada crustal block as it rose above the surrounding landscape.

The lower Kings River forms a large and gently sloping inland delta, or alluvial fan, extending laterally across the Central Valley – the resulting material from millions of years of erosion that carved Kings Canyon. The alluvial fan raised the elevation of the valley floor and blocked water flowing northward into the San Joaquin River, essentially creating a large bowl in the southern part of the valley, forming the Tulare Lake basin. Soils on the alluvial slope are generally sandy, permeable and fertile, creating ideal conditions for farming; in lower elevations and old lake beds the soil is more alkaline and less fertile.

Before people began building levees and dikes in the 19th century to contain flooding, the Kings River experienced frequent channel avulsion during high flow events, sometimes flowing north into the San Joaquin River via various sloughs, at other times south into Tulare Lake, and often into both. Historically, the river had a wide floodplain characterized by a system of vernal pools, oxbow lakes, and seasonal channels and marshes that supported a dense riparian habitat. The overflow area began near present-day Kingsburg and continued from there south to Tulare Lake.

In extremely wet years, Tulare Lake could fill to such an extent that it backed up the lower Kings River and overflowed through Fresno Slough into the San Joaquin River. All this intermittent flooding over thousands of years built up the valley&#x27;s huge groundwater reserves, which today are a vital water source for agriculture. The Kings Subbasin aquifer, as defined by the California Department of Water Resources, contained in 1961 a total of 93 million acre feet (115 km3), a level that has since been gradually declining due to intensive pumping for irrigation.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Kings River basin has experienced an increased number of dry years and particularly high temperatures in Kings Canyon National Park. The 2014–2015 water year was the driest for the Kings basin since official records began in 1895. Climate change is projected to significantly decrease the flow of the river by 2100. According to a 2014 study by UC Merced and UC Irvine researchers, average river flow could drop as much as 26 percent, due to warming temperatures causing increased plant growth in high elevations of the Sierra with a corresponding increase in evapotranspiration. The amount of available water in summer could also decrease due to more precipitation falling as rain in winter, rather than being stored in snowpack.

==Ecology==

Although most of the original wetlands and riparian zones in the valley have been lost to development, narrow riparian corridors still exist along of the Kings River between Pine Flat Dam and People&#x27;s Weir (below Highway 99), and in other places such as lower Fresno Slough. The largest riparian habitats are concentrated in the Centerville Bottoms, east of Sanger, where the river divides into multiple channels over a roughly wide area. Below Highway 99 the river channels, with few exceptions, are almost completely channelized and modified from their native state. A minimum Kings River flow of is maintained at all times via releases from Pine Flat Dam, in order to support fish populations and riparian habitats.

In the foothills, California oak woodlands consisting mainly of blue and black oak occur along the Kings River, Mill Creek and other perennial tributaries. Other foothill areas are dominated by thick chaparral and brush. At lower to middle elevations in the Sierra Nevada portion of the watershed, mixed conifer forests are the primary habitat, with ponderosa pine and yellow pine being dominant. Some areas, such as the steeper and more exposed north wall of Kings Canyon, remain primarily chaparral and brush. Giant sequoias are found in this area of the watershed. The General Grant Grove is located about southwest of the Middle and South Fork confluence; the Kings River groves, a set of four smaller groves, are situated lower in elevation and close to the South Fork.

Higher up in the Sierra, subalpine forests below the treeless alpine zone are characterized by red fir, lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, mountain hemlock and foxtail pine. Above in elevation, glacial features such as cirques and tarns characterize the landscape, with various wildflower and shrub species occurring in between areas of bare rock. Although the high country is usually covered in snow from November to May, as many as 600 plant species occur in the alpine zone of Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks, and twice that many are present in other parts of the parks. Starting in 2002, the U.S. Forest Service managed certain areas of the Kings basin under the Kings River Experimental Watersheds program, whose various activities include vegetation thinning and prescribed burns to address overgrowth, erosion and wildfire risk with the overall goal of improving water quality. These sites are concentrated mostly around the North Fork and Pine Flat Lake.
Above Pine Flat Dam, the Kings River holds native rainbow trout as well as introduced brown trout and smallmouth bass; the Upper Kings is designated a &quot;Wild Trout Water&quot; by the California Department of Fish and Game. Rainbow trout are also present in the river below the dam; however, the installation of a hydroelectric plant at Pine Flat Dam in 1984 diminished the cold water supply in the reservoir and deteriorated rainbow trout habitat as a result. In 1999, the state of California implemented the Kings River Fisheries Management Program, which has helped recover the fishery by mandating a minimum cold water pool of in Pine Flat Reservoir, and enforcing angling restrictions. Other fish species in the lower Kings include native Sacramento pikeminnow and Sacramento sucker (also present in smaller numbers upstream), and introduced species such as common carp, channel catfish and striped bass.

Another notable animal species is Kings River pyrg, a spring snail half the size of a pea that can only be found in 13 isolated desert springs around Thacker pass. However, the disruption of groundwater flows, road construction, and livestock grazing drove this interesting snail to near extinction.

==Early history==

At the time of first European contact, at least 5,000, but possibly as many as 15,000–20,000 Native Americans lived along the lower Kings River and its many branches in the Central Valley. The Kings River watershed is traditional Yokuts territory; the Kings River dialects of the Yokutsan language were divided among the Choynimni, who lived along about of the Kings River between present-day Piedra and Sanger; the Chukaymina along the Mill Creek tributary, and the Michahay further south. At least two other dialects, the Aiticha and the Toyhicha, were spoken further downstream on the Kings, but these groups have not been well documented.

The Yokuts mainly lived along the Kings River below the foothills and along the marshy fringes of Tulare Lake. The extensive oak forests in the Kings River riparian zone provided acorns, their main source of food. Wetlands provided them with abundant fish, waterfowl, fur-bearing animals including beaver and river otter, and edible roots. Tule rushes provided material for roofing their pit houses and building rafts and canoes, the main form of transport in the often flooded low country. The Yokuts traded with Paiute peoples (the Mono) in the Great Basin to the east, via various trails across the Sierra Nevada, one of which may have been via Kearsarge Pass at the eastern end of Kings Canyon. About 500 years ago, some of the Mono migrated west, settling in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada above Yokuts territory, where they eventually formed a distinct subgroup known as the Western Mono.

The first recorded Spanish explorers to see the Kings River were the members of Gabriel Moraga&#x27;s expedition, which camped along the river on January 6, 1806, the day of the Epiphany. Thus, they named the river &quot;El Rio de los Santos Reyes&quot; (&quot;River of the Holy Kings&quot;, i.e. the Three Magi), later shortened to &quot;Rio Reyes&quot;, &quot;Rio de los Reyes&quot; or other variations thereof. Father Pedro Muñoz, a member of the 1806 expedition, wrote: &quot;All the meadows are well covered with oak, alder, cottonwood and willow. The river abounds with beaver and fish. It is a location suitable for a mission, although there would also have to be a presidio.&quot; Extending the California mission system inland was a major goal of the Spanish Empire in the 1800s. However, no missions were ever established along the Kings River or elsewhere in the Central Valley.

Jedediah Smith was the first American explorer to see the Kings River, encountering it during a fur trapping expedition in 1827. John C. Fremont&#x27;s expedition in 1844 attempted to find a route over the Sierra Nevada via the Kings River, but were forced to turn back by deep snows and difficult terrain. Fourteen years later a party led by J.H. Johnson successfully crossed Kearsarge Pass – the route Fremont had failed to find – becoming the first known non-Native Americans to do so. Early maps from this era label the Kings River under a variety of names. Smith recorded the river as the &quot;Kimmel-che&quot; or &quot;Wimmel-che&quot; after &quot;Indians of that name who reside on it&quot;, likely a Yokuts clan or village along the lower part of the river. Fremont called it &quot;River of the Lake&quot; or &quot;Lake Fork&quot;, as it was the largest stream flowing into Tulare Lake. Some older maps label it &quot;King&#x27;s River&quot;, translated from the original Spanish name. By 1852, the name &quot;Kings River&quot; was in common use.

After California became a U.S. state in 1850, the upper Kings River watershed was used intermittently by stockmen, prospectors and loggers, and the lower watershed was used mainly for cattle and sheep ranching. Scottsburg, one of the first American towns on the Kings River, was founded in 1854. Destroyed twice by flooding, it was reestablished as today&#x27;s Centerville in 1867. Smith&#x27;s Ferry, established by James Smith in 1855, was one of several ferries established on the Kings River for travelers on the Stockton-Los Angeles Road and since it was the only one accessible during high water, remained the most important crossing of the Kings River for almost twenty years. After the Kern River gold rush of 1853, settlers arrived in large numbers to Tulare County and conflict broke out with Native Americans; a proposal to remove the natives to the Tejon Reservation was not acted upon. Skirmishes continued over the next few years, culminating in the Tule River War in spring 1856. Most of the natives not killed in the fighting or by foreign diseases were forcibly relocated from their lands along the Kings River to the Tule River Indian Reservation, where their descendants live today.

From the 1860s to the early 1900s, logging was one of the biggest industries in the upper Kings River. In 1890 two San Francisco businessmen purchased in the upper Kings watershed and founded the Kings River Lumber Company, intending to log the area&#x27;s abundant giant sequoias. Between 1890 and 1926 a huge logging operation was extended across the mountains, an area including Converse Basin Grove – then the world&#x27;s largest grove of sequoias – which was almost completely clear-cut. A dam was built to form Hume Lake, feeding a flume running more than 40 miles (64 km) down Kings Canyon to carry logs to the mill in Sanger. Despite the scale of the venture it was ultimately unprofitable. Sequoia wood is soft and unsuitable for most construction; in addition, the trees were so tall that they often shattered into unusable pieces when they hit the ground.

When John Muir visited and wrote about the Kings River and its canyon in the late 19th century, he brought attention to the area&#x27;s potential as a tourist attraction and its merit as a nature preserve. Muir lobbied for the preservation of the sequoia groves above the Kings River, which include General Grant Grove, home to the world&#x27;s second largest tree. Due to his efforts and those of local politicians and civic activists, President Benjamin Harrison signed a bill establishing General Grant National Park in October 1890. However, it would not be until 1940 when the park was extended to the middle and south forks of the Kings River and renamed Kings Canyon National Park.

==Settlement of the Kings delta==

The Kings River country was not an attractive site for early settlers, because for most of its lower course the river flows in an incised channel between low bluffs (an area known as the Centerville Bottoms), leaving the surrounding plains high and dry, suitable only for livestock grazing. Further downstream, approaching Tulare Lake, the land was too swampy for farming in addition to being seasonally flooded. For this reason, farmers initially favored the more well-watered Kaweah Delta, the present-day location of Visalia, to the south. Agriculture along the Kings River was limited to the Centerville Bottoms until ditches were extended from further upstream to supply the surrounding lands, the first being the short Byrd Ditch in 1858. The Great Flood of 1862 and another in 1868 destroyed most of the early settlements along the Kings River, and also wiped out the cattle ranching economy of the San Joaquin Valley, precipitating an economic shift to farming.

Starting in 1870 the settlement of the region began in earnest, and larger and more permanent water supply systems were built. Long canals brought water to the large, semi-arid prairie between the Kings and San Joaquin rivers, enabling the growth of Fresno and attracting many more settlers to the area. Farming cooperatives or &quot;colonies&quot;, where large landowners subdivided many small plots for individual farmers, were a popular early pattern of settlement and attracted immigrants from the eastern United States, Europe, and Asia. A few individuals were able to amass huge land holdings by exploiting loopholes in the Homestead Act and Swamp Land Act, the most successful being J.G. Boswell and his nephew James G. Boswell II, who acquired as much as in the lower Kings and the Tulare Lake bed. Despite portions being sold off since the 1980s, the Boswell family farm remains the largest privately owned farm in the world, at .

The Wright Act of 1887 allowed farmers to organize into irrigation districts, enabling them to pool their resources and greatly extend the reach of canal systems. The Alta Irrigation District, established in 1888, was the first of the newly formed irrigation districts to deliver water; it would be followed by at least eighteen others (some of which have since been consolidated). However, drought spawned conflict between earlier landowners with riparian rights and their newly arrived counterparts. In the days before Pine Flat Dam, the river often dropped too low by August or September to satisfy all the demands on it, and often disputes escalated to armed conflict over the control of canal gates. In 1897 the first Kings River water agreement was made, establishing irrigation districts&#x27; legal priority to water, resolving many lawsuits. However, by 1913 practically all the Kings River&#x27;s water was being used and farmers demanded a solution. In 1919 state engineer Charles L. Kaupke was assigned as the first Kings River &quot;watermaster&quot; – a role he served until 1956 – to settle issues of rationing and establish a &quot;diversion schedule&quot; to reduce water waste.

All these actions were still not enough to solve the basic issue of seasonal drought, and in 1925 a local board was convened to discuss the possibility of building a dam at Pine Flat. The Kings River Water Association (KRWA), representing most of the local water districts, was established two years later with Kaupke as its head. However, when the Great Depression hit, the districts could not sell the bonds necessary to build a dam, and the federal government was asked to step in. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation wanted to build the dam as part of its Central Valley Project and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wanted to build it as a separate flood control project. The KRWA favored the Corps&#x27; proposal because the reclamation project would be subject to a limitation per farm – a product of the Newlands Reclamation Act – and many farms in the area were larger than that (though none owned nearly as much land as the Boswells, who lobbied heavily for the Corps&#x27; project).

Political conflict raged on for more than ten years, with the Corps ultimately being authorized to build the dam, and the Bureau authorized to manage water storage. The dam was constructed between 1949 and 1954; only 19 months after its dedication, it stopped the monstrous flood of December 1955, the largest recorded flood on the Kings since at least 1862, sparing downstream towns from heavy damage. In 1963 all Kings River water users signed an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation establishing their shares of storage in Pine Flat Lake, granting them &quot;perpetual rights to use of storage subordinate only to flood control purposes,&quot; and in 1969 the California Department of Water Resources declared the Kings River fully appropriated, meaning that no new water rights can be claimed, unless bought from existing rights-holders.

==Modern uses==
===Irrigation===

Almost all of the Kings River&#x27;s water is consumed for agriculture. The river irrigates about 1.1 million acres (4,500 km2) of some of the most productive farmland in the United States; in 2009 the Kings delta produced crops valued at more than $3 billion. Fresno County, which is mostly supplied by Kings River water, ranked first among U.S. counties for agriculture sales in 2012. Tulare and Kings Counties ranked second and tenth, respectively.

The main crops grown in the Kings River service area are grapes, citrus, grain, and various fruits and nuts. Other crops include alfalfa, berries, rice, and miscellaneous nursery and field crops. More than of man-made canals deliver water to fourteen irrigation districts in the San Joaquin Valley. The Fresno, Kings River, Consolidated, Raisin City, Liberty and Laguna districts are located to the west of the river; the Tri-Valley, Hills Valley, Orange Cove, Alta and Kings County districts are located to the south. Kings River water also supplies the Riverdale, Stilson, James, Tranquility and Mid-Valley districts via Fresno Slough.

Surface water deliveries have been managed by the Kings River Water Association (KRWA), headed by the Kings River watermaster, since 1927. The KRWA oversees the water supply to 28 member agencies and about 20,000 farms in the Kings River service area, and is responsible for adjudicating water rights as well as regulating water quality. A monthly &quot;water entitlement schedule&quot; determines how much water each agency receives, contingent on the flow of the Kings River.

The Friant-Kern Canal, a part of the Central Valley Project (CVP), is the only source of surface water from outside the Kings River basin. Only the Fresno Irrigation District is contracted for CVP water, but other Kings River users can also purchase CVP water in times of need, such as droughts. Summer water demand for irrigation is typically in the range of .

Groundwater is the other major source of water supply for the basin, providing a large part of the agricultural supply and all of the water used by area cities. The Kings River Conservation District (KRCD), among its other functions, is the primary agency managing groundwater use. The Kings Basin Water Authority also monitors groundwater use, as well as certain water conservation, water quality and environmental functions. The Kings River provides more than of groundwater recharge to the local aquifer each year. However, depths to groundwater have been increasing for many years, indicating concern for the safe yield of the aquifer. The annual overdraft is estimated at .

===Hydropower===
The Kings River system has several major hydroelectric plants; the only one on the main stem is the Jeff L. Taylor Pine Flat Power Plant, located at the base of Pine Flat Dam. KRCD has operated the power plant since its completion in 1984. Power generation at Pine Flat Dam is incidental, meaning it is governed by demand for irrigation water or flood control requirements rather than demand for power. There was a proposal to add one more dam on the Kings River near Piedra, which would create a small regulating reservoir below Pine Flat Dam, allowing the power station to be used for peaking purposes while releasing a stable flow for irrigation. Due to environmental concerns and a poor cost-benefit ratio this project was never built.

Further upstream, the three forks of the Kings have considerable hydropower potential due to their large drop in elevation from the Sierra crest. However, because the Middle and South Forks are located in Kings Canyon National Park, only the North Fork is utilized for hydroelectric generation. The Haas, Balch No.1 and No.2, and Kings River powerhouses on the North Fork were built between 1927 and 1959 by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) and can collectively produce . In 2010, the four North Fork powerhouses plus Pine Flat generated more than 2 billion kilowatt hours (7200 TJ) of energy. Between 1977 and 1984, PG&amp;E constructed the Helms Pumped Storage Plant located between the Wishon and Courtright Reservoirs. The Helms plant, which pumps water up into Courtright during periods of low demand and releases it during high demand periods, is crucial to stabilizing the California electric grid by providing peaking power.

During the first half of the 20th century, the Kings River was the focus of a political fight over Los Angeles&#x27; proposal to dam the Middle and South Forks for power generation. Local farmers feared the city&#x27;s real intention was to divert Kings water south, as it had gained notoriety for doing in the Owens Valley water wars. The KRCD, however, also wanted to dam these rivers for irrigation, and thus the proposed dam sites were excluded from Kings Canyon National Park as designated in 1940. It was not until 1965 when these areas were finally added to the park, ending a debate which had lasted more than sixty years. Today, the fall from the head of the South Fork to Pine Flat Reservoir remains the longest undammed drop of any U.S. river.

===Flood control===

Pine Flat Dam, holding up to of water, is the primary flood control facility in the Kings River Basin. The winter and spring flood control reservation is , although the reservoir can be drawn down further depending on the size of the Sierra snowpack.

During the winter and spring, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for determining the water release from Pine Flat Dam. The dam provides flood protection for of farmland along the Kings River and another in the old Tulare Lake bed. Pine Flat Dam is operated so that the flow at Crescent Weir (about downstream of Pine Flat, near Riverdale) does not exceed , although this amount is frequently exceeded due to the large size and heavy runoff from the Kings watershed.

The floodwater capacity of the Kings River falls dramatically in downstream areas, from between Pine Flat Dam and Highway 180 to at Kingsburg. The key flood control facility on the lower river is the Island Weir and Army Weir complex, which control the water flow into the north and south forks of the Kings River, respectively. Flood flows up to are sent north; flows of up to above that level are diverted south into the Tulare Lake bed, and flows above that combined level are sent north.

On the north fork floodwaters are again divided at the Crescent Weir with the first sent north via Fresno Slough and James Bypass into the San Joaquin River, and the next south into the Tulare Lake bed. Any flows exceeding the total channel capacity of the north and south Forks are divided in whichever direction is currently safer.

The Kings River Conservation District (KRCD) is in charge of maintaining the system of flood control channels and levees. On the lower river west of Highway 99, the KRCD has worked since the 1950s to maintain the floodwater capacity of the Kings River and its various distributaries in the San Joaquin Valley. The KRCD service area consists of of levees starting from below Kingsburg, to SR 145 on the North Fork of the river, and to near Stratford on the South Fork. During flood conditions, KRCD patrols the levees 24 hours a day to monitor and repair any damages.

Since its construction in 1954, Pine Flat Dam has not provided the high degree of flood protection originally intended by the project. An average of of water are spilled each year because the reservoir is not big enough to hold it. In 1969 a total of , more than the entire capacity of the lake, flowed over the spillway, causing heavy damage downstream. The Bureau of Reclamation has studied the possibility of raising Pine Flat Dam to store more water.

In addition, local irrigation districts are engaged in efforts to use floodwater for groundwater recharge rather than allowing it to drain away, including the use of certain farm fields as temporary flood basins in winter. This will both reduce flood damage and provide more water for farmers&#x27; use.

==Recreation==

The upper reaches of the Kings River, including the entirety of the Middle Fork and most of the South Fork, flow through rugged backcountry that can be reached only by foot or on horseback. The Middle and South Forks are part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, as is about of the main Kings below their confluence. About are classified as Wild and as Recreational. The North Fork is more accessible, with boating, camping and visitor facilities at Wishon Reservoir and a boat launch at Courtright Reservoir.

Whitewater rafting and kayaking on the Middle and South Forks is &quot;extremely dangerous&quot; and is usually only done by experts. However, the main Kings between the Garnet Dike put-in and Pine Flat Lake is a popular run for both commercial rafting companies and private boaters. According to the Forest Service, &quot;the Kings River has the highest volume of water which can safely be rafted in the Sierra Nevada&quot;, and due to the large size and high elevation of its drainage basin it has a longer boating season than most other Sierra rivers.

The Kings River and its forks above Pine Flat Lake has naturally reproducing populations of rainbow trout, brown trout and brook trout. Fishing access above Pine Flat Lake extends as far upstream as Garlic Falls; beyond there, the canyon is too narrow to enter safely by foot except during periods of extremely low water. In lower elevation reaches and in the reservoir, smallmouth bass and spotted bass are common.

Below Pine Flat Dam the Kings River is wide and slow-flowing, with tailwater fishing for trout roughly between the dam and Highway 180; further downstream, carp, bass and catfish are more common. The lower river is suitable for swimming, floating and canoeing with many public access points between the dam and Avocado Lake. Below there, most of the banks are private property, with exceptions such as Pierce&#x27;s Park at Highway 180. Although there are few natural obstructions along the lower Kings, there are a number of diversion weirs that pose a hazard to boaters and must be portaged.

<text>A buzz cut, or wiffle cut, is a variety of short hairstyles, especially where the length of hair is the same on all parts of the head. Rising to prominence initially with the advent of manual hair clippers, buzz cuts became increasingly popular in places where strict grooming conventions applied. In several nations, buzz cuts are often given to new recruits in the armed forces or newly incarcerated inmates. However, buzz cuts are also used for stylistic reasons.

==Overview==
The buzz cut rose to popularity with the advent of manual hair clippers by the Serbian inventor Nikola Bizumić in the late 19th century. These clippers were widely used by barbers to chop hair close and fast. The clipper accumulates hair in locks to rapidly remove the hair from the head. This type of haircut was normal where strict grooming conventions were in effect. Buzz cut styles today include the brush cut, crew cut, and flattop.

The top of a buzz cut style may be clipped a uniform short length, producing a butch cut, or into one of several geometric shapes that include the crew cut, flattop, and other short styles. Also known as a fade haircut, the back and sides are tapered short, semi-short, or medium, corresponding with different clipper guard sizes. Buzz cuts can make the face look more defined and are popular with men and boys who want a short, low-maintenance hairstyle, as well as those with thinning or receding hairlines. However, thanks to the popularization by public figures like Sinead O&#x27;Connor, Natalie Portman, Amber Rose, and Willow Smith, the buzz cut has also become a popular haircut amongst women. It has also become a symbol of protest - going against society&#x27;s standards of feminine beauty.
In countries such as Australia, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, military recruits are given buzz cuts when they enter training; this was originally done to prevent the spread of head lice, but is now done for ease of maintenance, cooling, and uniformity.

<text>Harry Warren (born Salvatore Antonio Guaragna; December 24, 1893 – September 22, 1981) was an American composer and the first major American songwriter to write primarily for film. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song eleven times and won three Oscars for composing &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot; and &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot;. He wrote the music for the first blockbuster film musical, &quot;42nd Street&quot;, choreographed by Busby Berkeley, with whom he would collaborate on many musical films.

Over a career spanning six decades, Warren wrote more than 800 songs. Other well known Warren hits included &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot;, &quot;You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby&quot;, &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;, &quot;The Gold Diggers&#x27; Song (We&#x27;re in the Money)&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot;, &quot;There Will Never Be Another You&quot;, &quot;The More I See You&quot;, &quot;At Last&quot; and &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; (the last of which was the first gold record in history). Warren was one of America&#x27;s most prolific film composers, and his songs have been featured in over 300 films.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Warren was born Salvatore Antonio Guaragna, one of eleven children of Italian immigrants Antonio (a bootmaker) and Rachel De Luca Guaragna, and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. His father changed the family name to Warren when Harry was a child. Although his parents could not afford music lessons, Warren had an early interest in music and taught himself to play his father&#x27;s accordion. He also sang in the church choir and learned to play the drums. He began to play the drums professionally by age 14 and dropped out of high school at 16 to play with his godfather&#x27;s band in a traveling carnival. Soon he taught himself to play the piano and by 1915, he was working at the Vitagraph Motion Picture Studios, where he did a variety of administrative jobs, such as props man, and also played mood music on the piano for the actors, acted in bit parts and eventually was an assistant director. He also played the piano in cafés and silent-movie houses. In 1918 he joined the U.S. Navy, where he began writing songs.

===Career===
Warren wrote over 800 songs between 1918 and 1981, publishing over 500 of them. They were written mainly for 56 feature films or were used in other films that used Warren&#x27;s newly written or existing songs. His songs eventually appeared in over 300 films and 112 of Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons. 42 of his songs were on the top ten list of the radio program &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, a measure of a song&#x27;s popularity. 21 of these reached number 1 on Your Hit Parade. &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot; appeared 24 times. His song &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; is listed in the list of the 25 most-performed songs of the 20th Century, as compiled by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). Warren was the director of ASCAP from 1929 to 1932.

He collaborated on some of his most famous songs with lyricists Al Dubin, Billy Rose, Mack Gordon, Leo Robin, Ira Gershwin and Johnny Mercer. In 1942 the Gordon-Warren song &quot;Chattanooga Choo-Choo&quot;, as performed by the Glenn Miller Orchestra, became the first gold record in history. It was No.1 for nine weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart in 1941–1942, selling 1.2 million copies. Among his biggest hits were &quot;There Will Never Be Another You&quot;, &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot;, &quot;Forty-Second Street&quot;, &quot;The Gold Diggers&#x27; Song (We&#x27;re in the Money)&quot;, &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot;, &quot;Serenade In Blue&quot;, &quot;At Last&quot;, &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Getting to Be a Habit with Me&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot;, and &quot;Young and Healthy&quot;.

====Early hits and film years====

Warren&#x27;s first hit song was &quot;Rose of the Rio Grande&quot; (1922), with lyrics by Edgar Leslie. He wrote a succession of hit songs in the 1920s, including &quot;I Love My Baby (My Baby Loves Me)&quot; and &quot;Seminola&quot; in 1925, &quot;Where Do You Work-a John?&quot; and &quot;In My Gondola&quot; in 1926 and &quot;Nagasaki&quot; in 1928. In 1930, he composed the music for the song &quot;Cheerful Little Earful&quot; for the Billy Rose Broadway revue, &quot;Sweet and Low&quot;, and composed the music, with lyrics by Mort Dixon and Joe Young, for the Ed Wynn Broadway revue &quot;The Laugh Parade&quot; in 1931.

He started working for Warner Brothers in 1932, paired with Dubin to write the score for the first blockbuster film musical, &quot;42nd Street&quot;, and continued to work there for six years, writing the scores for 32 more musicals. He worked for 20th Century Fox starting in 1940, writing with Mack Gordon. He moved to MGM starting in 1944, writing for musical films such as &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; and &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot;, many starring Fred Astaire. He later worked for Paramount, starting in the early 1950s, writing for the Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman movie &quot;Just for You&quot; and the Martin and Lewis movie &quot;The Caddy&quot;, the latter containing the hit song &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot;. He continued to write songs for several more Jerry Lewis comedies.

Warren is particularly remembered for writing scores for the films of Busby Berkeley; they worked together on 18 films. His &quot;uptempo songs are as memorable as Berkeley&#x27;s choreography, as [sic] for the same reason: they capture, in a few snazzy notes, the vigorous frivolity of the Jazz Age.&quot;

Warren won the Academy Award for Best Song three times, collaborating with three different lyricists: &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot; with Al Dubin in 1935, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot; with Mack Gordon in 1943, and &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot; with Johnny Mercer in 1946. He was nominated for eleven Oscars.

====Last years====
In 1955, Warren wrote &quot;The Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;, which was used in the ABC/Desilu Studios television series, &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;. He also wrote the opening theme, &quot;Hey, Marty&quot; (lyrics by Paddy Chayefsky), for the film &quot;Marty&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1955. The last musical score that Warren composed specifically for Broadway was &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, a disastrous 1956 adaptation of James Hilton&#x27;s &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, which ran for only 21 performances. In 1957, he received his last Academy Award nomination for the song &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;. He continued to write songs for movies throughout the 1960s and 1970s but never again achieved the fame that he had enjoyed earlier. His last movie score was for &quot;Manhattan Melody&quot;, in 1980, but the film was never produced.

Warren composed a Mass, with Latin text, in 1962. This was performed a decade later at Loyola Marymount University, but it has yet to be recorded commercially. He also wrote nearly three dozen short piano vignettes. The sheet music was first published by Warren&#x27;s Four Jays Music Co. A dozen of these were released on a 1975 album titled &quot;Harry Warren&#x27;s Piano Vignettes&quot;, played by Hugh Delain. Several pianists have recorded the vignettes, including Warren himself.

===Personal life===
Warren married Josephine Wensler in 1917. They had a son, Harry Jr. (1919–1938), and a daughter, Joan (b. 1925). His wife died in 1993.

Warren died on September 22, 1981, in Los Angeles. He is interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. The plaque bearing Warren&#x27;s epitaph displays the first few notes of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;.

==Reputation and legacy==
According to Wilfrid Sheed, quoted in &quot;Time&quot; magazine: &quot;By silent consensus, the king of this army of unknown soldiers, the Hollywood incognitos, was Harry Warren, who had more songs on the Hit Parade than Berlin himself and who would win the contest hands down if enough people have heard of him.&quot; William Zinsser noted: &quot;The familiarity of Harry Warren&#x27;s songs is matched by the anonymity of the man ... he is the invisible man, his career a prime example of the oblivion that cloaked so many writers who cranked out good songs for bad movies.&quot; At least three episodes of the &quot;Lawrence Welk Show&quot; were devoted entirely to Warren&#x27;s music: Season 18, Episode 5, October 7, 1972; Season 25, Episode 10, November 24, 1979; and Season 27, Episode 17, January 2, 1982 Susannah McCorkle&#x27;s debut album was &quot;The Music of Harry Warren&quot; (1976).

In 1980, producer David Merrick and director Gower Champion adapted the 1933 film &quot;42nd Street&quot; into a Broadway musical that won the Tony Award for Best Musical in 1981, ran for 3,486 performances and has had several major revivals. The score incorporated songs by Warren and Dubin from various movie musicals, including &quot;42nd Street, Dames, Go Into Your Dance, Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, and &quot;Gold Diggers of 1935&quot;.

A theatre in Gravesend, Brooklyn, New York, the Harry Warren Theatre, was named for Warren in 1982.

===American songbook songs===

In his book &quot;American Popular Song&quot;, Alec Wilder notes that Warren &quot;wasn&#x27;t in the category as the best theater writers, but he certainly was among the foremost pop song writers.&quot; He discusses songs he likes: &quot;Would You Like to Take a Walk?&quot; (1930, with Mort Dixon and Billy Rose for &quot;Sweet &amp; Low&quot;), &quot;I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)&quot; (1931, with Dixon and Rose for &quot;Crazy Quilt&quot;), &quot;You&#x27;re Getting to Be a Habit with Me&quot; (1932), &quot;Summer Night&quot; (1936), &quot;There Will Never Be Another You&quot; (1942), &quot;Serenade in Blue&quot; (1942), &quot;At Last&quot; (1942), &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; (1938), and &quot;The More I See You&quot; (1945).

<text>Colonial goose is a preparation of roast leg of lamb or mutton popular as a dish in New Zealand until the last quarter of the 20th century.

Early colonial pioneers in New Zealand had sheep aplenty, but goose was relatively scarce. To prepare dishes similar to those they had back home in the old country the pioneers were very inventive. Colonial goose is now a recognised classic, with some restaurants featuring it as a main attraction at midwinter festivities (21 June in New Zealand).

It involves the careful boning out of a leg of lamb, stuffing it with honey and dried apricots, in addition to traditional stuffing based on breadcrumbs, onion, parsley and thyme or sage, and then marinating it in a red wine-based marinade which gives it the appearance of goose when cooked.

The 1919 cookbook &quot;First Catch Your Weka: A Story of New Zealand Food&quot; by David Veart, contains a recipe for colonial goose.

<text>The Inter-American Development credit union (IDB or IADB) is an international development finance institution headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States of America. It serves as one of the leading sources of development financing for independent countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Established in 1959, IDB supports Latin American and Caribbean economic development, social development and regional integration by lending to governments and government agencies, including state corporations.

== History ==
At the First Pan-American Conference in 1890, the idea of a development institution for Latin America was first suggested during the earliest efforts to create an inter-American system. The IDB became a reality under an initiative proposed by President Juscelino Kubitschek of Brazil. The Bank was formally created on April 8, 1959, when the Organization of American States drafted the Articles of Agreement establishing the Inter-American Development Bank.

== Operations ==

The IDB is one of the largest multilateral source of financing for the Latin America and the Caribbean region. The IDB makes loans to the governments of its borrowing member countries at standard commercial rates of interest, and has &quot;preferred creditor&quot; status, meaning that borrowers will repay loans to the IDB before repaying other obligations to other lenders such as commercial banks.

The IDB has four official languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese and French. Its official names in the other three languages are as follows:

=== Governance ===
The IDB is governed by its Board of Governors, a 48-member body who regularly meets once a year. In March 2010, reunited in Cancun, Mexico, the Board of Governors of the Bank agreed on a $70 billion capital increase, along with full debt forgiveness for Haiti, its poorest member country, devastated by an earthquake that had destroyed its capital, Port-au-Prince, two months before.

The developing countries that borrow from the IDB are the majority shareholders, and therefore control the majority of the decision-making bodies of the Bank. Each member&#x27;s voting power is determined by its shareholding: its subscription to the Bank&#x27;s ordinary capital. The United States holds 30 percent of the Bank&#x27;s shares, while the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean combined hold 50.02 percent but with another 20% from Europe the US can veto decisions. This arrangement is unique in that the developing member countries, as a group, are the majority shareholders. Though this arrangement was first viewed as risky, it is believed by some that strict peer pressure prevents the borrowers from defaulting, even when under severe economic pressure.

=== Presidents ===
Mauricio Claver-Carone was removed by the governors of IDB after an ethics investigation found that he had an affair with a subordinate and gave her a pay raise. The affair allegedly occurred during Claver-Carone&#x27;s tenure on the National Security Council during the Trump administration. Executive Vice President Reina Irene Mejía of Honduras took over as acting president. 

Ilan Goldfajn of Brazil was elected on November 20, 2022, and assumed his responsibilities as president on December 19, 2022.

=== Vision ===
The IDB&#x27;s Education Division works in partnership with 26 borrowing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to ensure that children and adolescents exercise their right to a quality education, achieve their potential, and reverse the cycle of poverty.

=== Mission ===
Given that education is a key to development and a prerequisite for a genuine equality of opportunity, and given its strategic importance to the region, the IDB has an Education Initiative that focuses its research and projects in three main areas: Early Childhood Development, School to Work Transition and Teacher Quality.

== Financial resources ==
The callable capital pledged by the 22 non-borrowing members, which include the world&#x27;s wealthiest developed countries, therefore functions as a guarantee for the bonds that the IDB sells. This arrangement ensures that the IDB maintains a triple-A credit rating, and as a result can make loans to its borrowing member countries at rates of interest similar to those that commercial banks charge their largest corporate borrowers. At the same time, the 22 non-borrowing countries are only putting up guarantees – not actual funds – so their support of the IDB&#x27;s lending operations has a minimal impact on their national budgets.

The funds that the IDB lends are raised by selling bonds to institutional investors at standard commercial rates of interest. The bonds are backed by (a) the sum of the capital subscriptions actually paid in by the Bank&#x27;s 47 member countries, plus (b) the sum of the callable capital subscriptions pledged by the Bank&#x27;s 22 non-borrowing member countries. Together these constitute the Bank&#x27;s &quot;ordinary capital&quot;, some US$101 billion. Of this amount, 4.3 percent is paid in, while the remaining 95.7 percent is callable.

Aside from its lending activities for its member countries, the IDB also has lending operations with private sector companies, both directly through its Structured Corporate Finance Department and Opportunities for the Majority Initiative, and by means of the IDB Invest, a multilateral lender created by the IDB member countries, and part of the IDB Group, to help develop small and medium-sized companies in Latin America and the Caribbean. An affiliate of the IDB, IDB Lab (formerly the Multilateral Investment Fund - FOMIN), uses loans, grants and equity investments to support private projects seeking to bring innovation, boost entrepreneurship, or expand access to financing throughout the region. The Bank, IDB Invest and IDB Lab constitute the IDB Group.

=== Country status ===

The Bank is owned by 48 sovereign states, which are its shareholders and members. Only the 26 borrowing countries are able to receive loans.

=== Capital increase ===
On July 21, 2010, the Board of Governors agreed to increase the Bank&#x27;s ordinary capital by $70 billion, the largest expansion of resources in the Bank&#x27;s history, and to provide an unprecedented package of financial support to Haiti. The agreement also includes a replenishment of the Fund for Special Operations, which finances operations in the region&#x27;s poorest nations.

The Bank&#x27;s capital increase will be implemented through 2015 as parliaments in each of its member countries appropriate the necessary funds.

== Priority areas ==
In March 2015, the Bank updated its Institutional Strategy for 2010–2020. The document says that to ultimately transform Latin American and the Caribbean &#x27;into a more inclusive and prosperous society, three main development challenges must be addressed: social exclusion and inequality, low productivity and innovation, and limited economic integration.&quot; Moreover, the document also says that &quot;these three challenges are inter-related and certain overarching issues
cut across them that public policies need to address: gender equality and diversity; climate change and environmental sustainability; and institutions and the rule of law.&quot;

=== Education Initiative ===
==== Early childhood development ====
The IDB supports readiness to learn interventions so that children can have access to quality programs within the region. Among the projects in this area are the Regional Project on Child Development Indicators (PRIDI), which provides high quality, policy-relevant, and regionally comparative data on the situation of young children and their families. These data will allow countries to benchmark progress on childhood development both within their borders and in the region, thus facilitating policy dialogue between governments on how to best address the needs of young children and their families. Participating countries include Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru and Paraguay. The IDB also participates in the Support for a Seamless Education System Program in Trinidad and Tobago, which aims to improve the quality of early childhood care and primary education, and the Alliance for Children Initiative (Alianza por la Iniciativa Infantil), an initiative that seeks to foster collaboration between governments, families, civil society and the private sector to support innovative interventions in the field.

==== Teacher quality ====
The IDB supports interventions to improve teacher quality in Latin America and the Caribbean and conducts research in the field. It supports the Aligning of Learning Incentives (ALI) in Mexico, a pilot program that provides monetary incentives to students, faculty and staff to improve student achievement in mathematics. Brazil also supports the tutoring program, Multiplying Knowledge, where academically successful students help children in the last years of primary school with mathematics. and the implementation and evaluation of Enseña Chile, a program that attracts outstanding college graduates to teach for two years in vulnerable schools. The Inter-American Development bank focuses on three main areas: incentives (with particular emphasis on teachers), supplies (with emphasis on teacher training and capacity building), and administration (targeting school management).

==== School to work transition ====
The IDB supports the development of knowledge, interventions, programs, and policies to improve the competencies and skills acquired by adolescents in the education system so they will contribute to a student&#x27;s successful transition between school and work. The projects for this field include supporting the government of Costa Rica to improve the English as a foreign language project in order to close the skills gap between the demand in the labor market and the supply of the education systems in the field. As part of its research agenda, the IDB conducted a survey of young students from Chile analyzing their educational labor trajectory while measuring certain cognitive and non-cognitive skills, relating them to the education and labor performance of adolescents. The IDB also implemented The Employers’ Survey of Mandatory Skills (ENEHD, Spanish Acronym), that investigated the twenty-first century skills demanded by entrepreneurs for people under 25.

==== Other projects ====
The Bank also has interventions in other areas that affect children and adolescents in the region, such as education inputs, equity, and compensatory programs. The initiatives in these fields are support projects for the reconstruction of educational infrastructure in Haiti; a support project for the consolidation and expansion of the Plan Ceibal in Uruguay; a community education program in Mexico, which aims to raise quality of educational services for marginalized communities; a project to support the education plan in the Dominican Republic; the National Infrastructure Program for the universalization of education quality and equality in Ecuador; a program to support policies for the improvement of education equity in Argentina (PROMEDU); a project to improve education activities and learning quality in Mexico; and a comprehensive care program for children in Nicaragua, which contributes to the development of children living in extreme poverty within rural areas under 6 years old.

=== Climate Change and Sustainability Division ===

Climate change threatens both to undermine the long-term efforts of the region to achieve sustainable development and to affect the most vulnerable members of society disproportionately.

To respond to increasing demand for clients for assistance in addressing climate change, the General Capital Increase (GCI-9) commits the Bank to support mitigation and adaptation efforts of borrowing members while meeting their developmental and energy requirements. GCI-9 sets a target of 25 percent of total lending going to a growing portfolio on climate change, environmental sustainability, and renewable energy.

==== Climate Change Strategy ====
The objective of the Climate Change Strategy (CCS) is to serve as a guiding instrument for scaling up IDB support for actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change within Latin America and the Caribbean Leveraging the IDB&#x27;s institutional strengths and its unique advantages, the CCS will promote the development and use of a range of public and private sector financial and nonfinancial instruments for strengthening the institutional, technical, and financial capacity to address climate change challenges.
=== Water and sanitation ===
There are four programs in the Water and Sanitation Division: 100 Cities Program, Water for 3,000 Rural Communities, Water Defenders and Efficient and Transparent Utilities.

The Bank has also a number of focused special programs: AquaFund, Energy Efficient, Hydro-BID, and AquaRating.

==== Hydro-BID ====
In order to support the Latin American and Caribbean region to address water resources challenges, the IDB has created Hydro-BID, a tool that allows the efficient management and planning of water resources by predicting water availability taking into consideration the impacts of climate change.

Hydro-BID was developed to respond to the challenges related to lack of information, reliable data and the lack of tools to support governments, water utilities, the private sector and other institutions to plan and make better decisions for a sustainable management on behalf of the consumers of water, the people.

==== AquaRating ====
AquaRating is the first rating agency for the water sector. It is an Inter-American Development Bank venture, hosted by the International Water Association. The rating system has already been piloted in thirteen utilities in nine countries in Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean. A worldwide market introduction is planned during 2015.

=== Infrastructure ===
The satisfactory provision and administration of infrastructure stimulates economic growth and competitiveness. It is also essential for 
improving the quality of life and inclusion in modern society.
The infrastructure strategy identifies priority areas of action: a)Promote access to infrastructure services b)Support infrastructure for regional and global integration c)Foster financing mechanisms and leverage private sector participation in infrastructure d) Adopt and promote a multisector agenda e) Support the construction and maintenance of an environmentally and socially sustainable infrastructure f) Promote ongoing improvements in infrastructure 
governance

Of the 44 new projects, 32% are in the infrastructure and environment sector.

== Criticisms ==
There are claims that operations funded by the IDB may have adverse impacts on local environments and indigenous peoples. According to the Bank Information Center (BIC), &quot;civil society groups have long been concerned about the negative impacts the IDB&#x27;s operations have on the environment and on indigenous and traditional peoples, as well as on the prospects for genuine economic and democratic reform in the region&quot;. The BIC cites environmental and social damage funded by the IDB as adversely impacting local economies, contrary to IDB&#x27;s stated goal of fostering social and economic prosperity.

=== Poverty reduction ===
Governments of developing countries are not equipped to reduce poverty due to heavy responsibility to build and maintain infrastructure, as well as meet payroll and debt obligations. Tax revenue is often weak or non-existent. Poverty reduction depends largely on business investment in global markets to create sustainable jobs for economic empowerment of individuals. International companies need funding, and difficulty lies on the inability of the investment banks to overcome regulatory obstacles.

Small business entities are largely responsible for improving lives, as they play an inherent role in raising the socio-economic status of families, making it possible to combat poverty in the long range, as employed heads of household are in better positions to finance the education of children for a better future. Hence, empowering institutions, such as, The World Bank, IFC, the IADB, and others can exercise their due diligence to fit those promising entities in their projects with eased regulatory restraints, as certain regulations that work in developed nations are obstacles to progress in developing nations.

== Member state comparison table ==
The following table are amounts for 20 largest countries by subscribed capital stock, voting power, and FSO contribution quotas at the Inter-American Development Bank as of December 2020.

== Haiti ==
After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the IDB pledged to provide Haiti more than $2.2 billion in grants over the next decade to fund its recovery efforts and long-term development plans, working closely with the Haitian government and the international community. The Bank&#x27;s Board of Governors also agreed to cancel all of Haiti&#x27;s outstanding debt.

President Préval also gave the Inter-American Development Bank the mandate to work with the Education Ministry and the National Commission preparing a major reform of the Education System in a 5-year plan.

<text>Michel Courtemanche (; born December 11, 1964) is a Canadian comedian and actor from Quebec, performing in Quebec, France, Belgium and Switzerland.

== Career ==
His debut one-man show, &quot;A New Comic is Born&quot;, ran for more than five hundred performances and earned him two Felix nominations. It was first performed in Montreal in 1989. His second, &quot;The New Adventures of Michel Courtemanche&quot;, first performed in 1992, filled theatres in both North America and Europe and spawned his second international hit video (1993).

Courtemanche has internationally sold out large theatres, and has inspired a hardcover comic book. Courtemanche appeared in &quot;Québécois&quot; films &quot;Nuit de Noces&quot; and &quot;Karmina 2&quot;, and on the &quot;Secret Adventures of Jules Verne&quot; television series, on American pay television channel Syfy.

His style of comedy can be described as mime combined with sound effects, as he is most often seen interacting with invisible objects or even people and using his voice to complete the scene. He is also known for making remarkable grimaces.

In 2002, he moved from acting to working behind the camera. His production company, Encore Télévision, produces the French-Canadian edition of the sitcom Caméra café, which was adapted from French television.

== Awards and honors ==
* Asteroid 63129 Courtemanche, discovered by Swiss astronomer Stefano Sposetti in 2000, was named in his honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on June 13, 2006 ().

<doc id="382594" wikidata="Q675475" url="?curid=382594" title="Suzuki method">
<text>The Suzuki method is a mid-20th-century music curriculum and teaching method created by Japanese violinist and pedagogue Shinichi Suzuki. The method claims to create a reinforcing environment for learning music for young learners.

==Background==
The Suzuki Method was conceived in the mid-20th century by Shinichi Suzuki, a Japanese violin salesman. Suzuki noticed that children pick up their native language quickly, whereas adults consider even dialects difficult to learn but are spoken with ease by children at age five or six. He reasoned that if children have the skill to acquire their native language, they might have the ability to become proficient on a musical instrument. Suzuki decided to develop a teaching method after a conversation with Leonor Michaelis, who was Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Nagoya.

Suzuki pioneered the idea that a preschool age child could learn to play the violin if the learning steps were small enough and the instrument was scaled down to fit their body. He modeled his method, which he called , after his theories of natural language acquisition. Suzuki believed that every child, if properly taught, was capable of a high level of musical achievement. He also made it clear that the goal of such musical education was to raise generations of children with &quot;noble hearts&quot; as opposed to creating famous musical prodigies.

==Philosophy==
The central belief of Suzuki, based on his language acquisition theories, is that all people can (and will) learn from their environment. The essential components of his method spring from the desire to create the &quot;right environment&quot; for learning music, which he also believed would foster excellent character in every student.

The method parallels the linguistic environment of acquiring a native language from the young age, which is usually referred to &quot;mother-tongue&quot; method. Suzuki believed that this environment would also help to foster good moral character. These components include:

* Saturation in the musical community
*: This includes attending local classical music concerts, developing friendships with other music students, and listening to recordings of professional musicians in the home every day, starting before birth if possible
* Deliberate avoidance of musical aptitude tests or auditions to begin music study.
*: Suzuki believed that teachers who test for musical aptitude before taking students, or who look only for &quot;talented&quot; students, are limiting themselves to people who have already started their music education. Just as every child is expected to learn their native language, Suzuki expected every child to be able to learn to play music.
* Emphasis on playing from a very young age.
*: Suzuki believed that children should typically start formal instruction between the ages of three and five years old. (See ).
* Using well-trained teachers.
*: Suzuki believed in training musicians not only to be better musicians, but also to be better teachers. Suzuki Associations worldwide offer ongoing teacher-training programs to prospective and continuing Suzuki teachers.
* The beginning of teaching is emphasized by learning music by ear over reading written musical notation.
*: Suzuki observed that children speak before learning to read, and thought that children should also be able to play music before learning to read. To support learning by ear, students are expected to listen to recordings of the music they are learning daily.
* Memorization of all solo repertoire is expected.
*: The focus on memorization continues even after a student begins to use sheet music to learn new pieces.
* Music theory and note reading are left to the teacher.
*: The Suzuki method does not include a formal plan or prescribe specific materials for introducing music theory and reading, in part because Suzuki created the method in a culture where music literacy was routinely taught in schools.
* Regular playing in groups (including playing pieces in unison) is strongly encouraged.
*: Retaining and reviewing every piece of music ever learned is also strongly encouraged. This is intended to raise technical and musical ability. Review pieces, along with &quot;preview&quot; parts of music a student is yet to learn, are often used in place of the more traditional etude books. Traditional etudes and technical studies are not used in the beginning stages, which focus almost exclusively on a set of performance pieces.
* Frequent public performance makes performing feel like a natural and enjoyable part of being a musician.
*: The method is meant to discourage competition between players and advocate collaboration and mutual encouragement for those of every ability and level. However, this does not mean the complete elimination of auditions or evaluations of student performances.
*: The parent of the young student is expected to supervise instrument practice every day to attend and take notes at every lesson so they can coach the student effectively, an element of the method once dubbed &quot;The Mom-Centric Method.&quot;

==Technique==
Although Suzuki was a violinist, the method he founded is not a &quot;school of violin playing&quot; whose students can be identified by the set of techniques they use to play the violin. However, some of the technical concepts Suzuki taught his own students, such as the development of &quot;tonalization,&quot; were so essential to his way of teaching that they have been carried over into the entire method. Other non-instrument specific techniques are used to implement the basic elements of the philosophy in each discipline.

*Tonalization is defined as the student&#x27;s ability to produce and recognize a beautiful, ringing tone quality on their instrument. This term was coined by Suzuki and is based on the word &quot;vocalization.&quot; While initially developed for violin education, the tonalization technique has been applied to other instruments, including the piano. Suzuki believed that a student must learn tonalization in order to properly reproduce and perform music. Outside the Suzuki method, the term used is &quot;tone production,&quot; and is part of Western music education stretching back to its beginning.
*The use of sound recordings is another technique common to all the musical instruments taught in the Suzuki method. Pre-recorded music is used to help students learn notes, phrasing, dynamics, rhythm, and tone quality by ear. Suzuki believed that the advent of recording technology made it possible for large numbers of &quot;ordinary&quot; people whose parents were not themselves great musicians and music teachers to be surrounded with excellent performances from birth. The Suzuki method requires daily listening in the home from before birth if possible and the implementation of a beginner&#x27;s repertoire alongside recordings of advanced repertoire.
*Instruments are adapted to meet the demands of a small child&#x27;s body in various ways. This lowers the age at which people are anatomically ready to begin studying an instrument. Scaled-down instrument sizes are used for children studying stringed instruments. Curved-headjoint flutes with displaced keys (which are closer together than normal flute keys) and holes are also available, making it possible for children as young as three to study the flute. Height-adjustable chairs, benches, and footrests are used for piano, guitar, cello, and double bass. Fractional-sized student violins were already available when Suzuki began to teach, but the popularity of the method prompted violinmakers to scale violins down to even smaller sizes than before.
*Suzuki Institutes were established to encourage a musical community, train teachers, and provide a place where master teachers&#x27; ideas can be spread to the whole community of Suzuki students, teachers and parents. These short term music festivals began in Matsumoto, Japan, where teachers &amp; students came to learn from Suzuki. In the US, they often last for a week or two and include daily masterclasses; repertoire (group) classes; teacher training courses; concerts; discussion sessions; seminars; and various &#x27;enrichment&#x27; classes in different musical styles, instruments, or non-musical (usually arts, crafts, or dancing) activities. As at any music festival, participants must pay registration and tuition fees to the institute they are attending. Each national Suzuki association handles registration for teacher training, and policies differ from country to country.
*A common repertoire for all students of an instrument was established. This body of music is designed to allow each student to participate in group classes, help foster local and international musical community and camaraderie, and provide motivation for students to learn new music while keeping the &#x27;old&#x27; pieces they have learned in top form.

==Repertoire==
The core Suzuki literature is published on audio recordings and in sheet music books for each instrument, and Suzuki teachers supplement the repertoire common to each instrument as needed, particularly in the area of teaching reading. One of the innovations of the Suzuki method was to make professional recordings of beginner level pieces widely available. Many non-Suzuki trained music teachers also use the Suzuki repertoire to supplement their curriculum.

Suzuki literature also deliberately leaves out many technical instructions and exercises found in the beginners&#x27; music books of his day. He favored a focus on melodic song-playing over technical exercises and asked teachers to allow students to make music from the beginning, helping to motivate young children with short, attractive songs which can themselves be used as technique building exercises. Each song in the common repertoire is meant to introduce some new or higher level of technique than the previous selection.

Suzuki teaching uses a common core repertoire for students of the same instrument worldwide. Although it focuses on Western European &quot;classical&quot; music, it emphasizes that this music can be a bridge across cultural and language barriers.

===Violin===
The violin method was compiled and edited by Suzuki in ten volumes, beginning with Suzuki&#x27;s Variations on &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; and ending with two Mozart concertos.

The first three volumes are mostly graded arrangements of music not originally written for violin, although the first volume contains several original compositions by Suzuki for violin and piano. These arrangements are drawn from folk tunes and from composers such as Bach, Dvořák, Beethoven, Handel, Paganini, Boccherini and Brahms. Volumes 4 to 10 continue the graded selection by incorporating &#x27;standard&#x27; or &#x27;traditional&#x27; student violin solos by composers such as Seitz, Vivaldi, Bach, Veracini, Corelli, Dittersdorf, Rameau, Handel, Mozart and Fiocco.

The Suzuki violin repertoire is currently in the process of being revised by the International Suzuki Association, and as part of the revision process, each regional Suzuki Association provides a recommended list of supplemental repertoire appropriate for students in volumes 6 to 8. The Suzuki Association of the Americas&#x27; supplemental repertoire list includes pieces by composers such as Bach, Kreisler, Elgar, Bartok, Shostakovich and Copland.

The first three volumes were recorded by Hilary Hahn and released in 2020. Audio recordings for the first four volumes are also available in separate albums by artists such as David Nadien, David Cerone, Yukari Tate and Suzuki himself. Revised editions and recordings of the first four volumes were released in 2007 and recorded by William Preucil, Jr. Recordings for volumes 5 to 8 have been made by Koji Toyoda, although many of the pieces can be found separately on other artists&#x27; albums. In 2008, Takako Nishizaki made a complete set of recordings of volumes 1 to 8 for Naxos Records.

There are no official recordings of volumes 9 and 10. However, since these volumes contain Mozart&#x27;s A major and D major violin concertos respectively, they have readily-available recordings by various violinists. Completing the 10 volumes is not the end of the Suzuki journey, as many Suzuki violin teachers traditionally continue with the Bruch and Mendelssohn concertos, along with pieces from other composers such as Paradis, Mozart, and Kreisler.

===Viola===
The viola method was compiled and edited by Doris Preucil in nine volumes. Like the violin repertoire, much of the viola repertoire is drawn from the Baroque period. The first three volumes have been arranged (or transposed) almost directly from the first three violin volumes, and the rest differ significantly as they delve into standard viola literature. The viola books introduce shifting and work in higher positions earlier than the violin volumes, in anticipation of viola students being asked to play in ensembles sooner in their studies than violinists, and needing these skills to better handle orchestral or chamber music parts (Preucil, 1985). Volumes 4 to 8 include works by Telemann, Casadesus, Bach, Mendelssohn, Vivaldi, Leclair, Hummel, and Bruch.

The first four volumes have been recorded on two albums by William Preucil, and the rest are available in separate albums.

===Cello===
The cello method is in ten volumes, with some early pieces arranged from the early violin volumes. The first piece unique to the cello repertoire is the second overall: &quot;French Folk Song&quot;. The first four volumes have been performed by Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi. Volumes 4 to 10 contain works by composers such as Vivaldi, Saint-Saëns, Popper, Breval, Goltermann, Squire, Bach, Paradis, Eccles, Fauré, van Goens, Sammartini, Haydn and Boccherini.

===Piano===
The piano method is in seven volumes. The first volume begins with Variations on &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; (as with the violin books) and continues with many folk songs and contemporary songs. As one progresses to the second volume, there are pieces written by romantic, classical and baroque composers, such as Schumann, Beethoven and Bach. There are also many minuets in the second book. The third book is early intermediate level with several sonatinas and beginning with Sonatina in C Major, Op. 36, No. 1 by Muzio Clementi. The fourth book includes Sonata in G Major, Op. 49, No. 2 by Ludwig van Beethoven and ends with three movements from the Partita in B-flat by J.S. Bach. The fifth book begins with &quot;Für Elise&quot; by Beethoven and includes the Sonata in C Major, Hob. XVI/35 by Franz Joseph Haydn. The sixth book begins with the Sonata in C Major by Mozart, and the seventh book begins with the Sonata in A Major by Mozart. This book also includes &quot;The Harmonious Blacksmith&quot; by Handel and the Romanian Folk Dances by Bartók.

The New International Edition adds some more recent compositions to the books, such as the music of Béla Bartók. Revised versions of the piano books have now been published. The new volumes are collections of piano repertoire from all eras representing works by composers such as Mozart, Burgmüller, Beethoven, Bach, Tcherepnin, Tchaikovsky, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Daquin, Grieg, Granados, Villa-Lobos, Scarlatti, Handel, Bartók, and Debussy. Many pieces from the original books remain; some have been moved to another volume. Book and CD combinations for the revised volumes 4 to 7 were performed by Japanese concert artist Seizo Azuma.

===Bass===
Currently there are five printed volumes in the double bass series, with the first three volumes also available on recordings. Nine volumes are planned and being compiled and edited by Dr. S Daniel Swaim (SAA, Chair), Virginia Dixon (SAA), Michael Fanelli (SAA), Domenick Fiore (SAA), and Eugene Rebeck (SAA). The first two volumes contain arrangements of the traditional Suzuki violin pieces mixed in with some new arrangements of other pieces. Volume 3 contains some new transcriptions of jazz, Gaelic, and folk songs; plus works by Handel, Gossec, Beethoven, Bach, Webster, Saint-Saëns, and Dvořák. Famous pieces include: &quot;The Elephant&quot; from Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Saëns, Ode to Joy by Beethoven, and &quot;Largo&quot; from the New World Symphony by Dvořák.

===Flute===
The flute repertoire was compiled and edited by Toshio Takahashi in fourteen volumes. It begins with Mary Had a Little Lamb and ends in the Flute Concerto by Otaka. Also included are concerti by Mozart, Cimarosa, Ibert and Quantz. Students also study music by Bach, Handel, Blavet, Fauré and other major composers.

===Recorder===
There are eight volumes of recorder repertoire for both soprano and alto recorder. The recorder repertoire shares some early repertoire with other instruments, such as &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; and several Bach Minuets. Later books delve into more complex Renaissance and Baroque music, including instruction in intense Baroque ornamentation along with 17th-century Dutch and Italian articulation techniques.

===Guitar===
The classical guitar repertoire was compiled through a collaborative process involving teachers from the United States, Europe and Australia, and edited by Frank Longay. The nine volumes begin with Twinkle Variations and many folk songs, and adds pieces originally written for the lute in the Renaissance, and spanning all musical time periods, including pieces by Sanz, Vivaldi, Bach, Carcassi, Giuliani, Sor, Tarrega, Albéniz, Mudarra, and Yocoh&#x27;s Sakura Variations. Music in book one is performed by Frank Longay and Bill Kossler, with books two through four recorded by Seth Himmelhoch, Andrew LaFrenier, and Louis Brown. George Sakellariou has recorded books five, six and seven and William Kanengiser recorded books 8 and 9, with the exception of Recuerdos de la Alhambra in book 9, which was recorded by Scott Tennant.

===Harp===
The harp repertoire is in five volumes. These books are suitable for learning to read and play music on the pedal harp or the lever harp (folk harp, Irish/Celtic harp, etc. that preferably has 30 or more strings). Most of the music is arrangements of either folk music or classical music. Students of the lever harp will find some of the pieces in the later books to have challenging lever changes. This series ultimately leads to more in-depth study of the pedal harp and its repertoire and teaches more of a classical style technique. Those pursuing traditional Celtic music can use this as a foundation, however, the traditional style of teaching focuses on relying on the ear rather than on the written note. Repertoire for volume six is selected, though the music is not published in a single book.

===Voice===
The voice repertoire is in five Levels. Developed in Finland since 1986, the vocal repertoire of the Suzuki method has spread to over 20 countries including The United States, Australia, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. Teacher training courses are scheduled yearly in Europe, US and Australia.

===Organ===
The pipe organ repertoire was compiled and edited by Gunilla Rönnberg and Lars Hagström beginning in 1998. , eight volumes have been published. , an active Suzuki-training organ scheme is under way in the Australian city of Newcastle.

===Mandolin===
The application of Suzuki&#x27;s teaching philosophy to the mandolin is currently being researched in Italy by Amelia Saracco.

== Early childhood education (SECE) and Suzuki in the schools ==
Rather than focusing on a specific instrument, at the stage of early childhood education (ECE), a Suzuki Early Childhood Education (SECE) curriculum for (pre-instrumental) ECE was developed within the Suzuki philosophy by Dorothy &amp; Sharon Jones (SAA), Jeong Cheol Wong (ASA), Emma O&#x27;Keefe (PPSA), Anke van der Bijl (ESA), and Yasuyo Matsui (TERI). The SECE curriculum is designed for ages 0–3 and uses singing, nursery rhymes, percussion, audio recordings, and whole body movements in a group setting where children and their adult caregivers participate side by side. The Japanese based SECE curriculum is different from the English-based SECE curriculum. The English-based curriculum is currently being adapted for use in other languages.

A &quot;modified&quot; Suzuki philosophy curriculum has been developed to apply Suzuki teaching to heterogeneous instrumental music classes &amp; string orchestras in schools.

===Trumpet===
Trumpet was added to the International Suzuki Association&#x27;s list of Suzuki Method instruments in 2011. The application of Suzuki&#x27;s teaching philosophy to the trumpet is currently being researched in Sweden; the first Trumpet teacher training course to be offered by the European Suzuki Association in 2013. (Suzuki Teacher Training for Trumpet, 2013).

== Supplemental materials ==
Supplementary materials are also published under the Suzuki name, including some etudes, note-reading books, piano accompaniment parts, guitar accompaniment parts, duets, trios, string orchestra, and string quartet arrangements of Suzuki repertoire.

== Historical notes ==

In the late 19th century, Japan&#x27;s borders were opened to trade with the outside world, and in particular to the importation of Western Culture. As a result of this, Suzuki&#x27;s father, who owned a company which had manufactured the Shamisen, began to manufacture violins instead. In his youth, Shin&#x27;ichi Suzuki chanced to hear a phonograph recording of Franz Schubert&#x27;s Ave Maria, as played on violin by Mischa Elman. Gripped by the beauty of the music, he immediately picked up a violin from his father&#x27;s factory and began to teach himself to play the instrument &quot;by ear&quot;. His father felt that instrumental performance was beneath his son&#x27;s social status, and refused to allow him to study the instrument. At age 17, he began to teach himself by ear, since no formal training was allowed to him. Eventually he convinced his father to allow him to study with a violin teacher in Tokyo. (Suzuki, &quot;Nurtured by Love&quot;)

At age 22, Suzuki travelled to Germany to find a violin teacher to continue his studies. While there, he studied privately with Karl Klingler, but did not receive any formal degree past his high school diploma. He met and became friends with Albert Einstein, who encouraged him in learning classical music. He also met, courted, and married his wife, Waltraud. (Suzuki, &quot;Nurtured by Love&quot;)

In 1945, Suzuki began his Talent Education movement in Matsumoto, Japan shortly after the end of World War II. Raising children with &quot;noble hearts&quot; (inspired by great music and diligent study) was one of his primary goals; he believed that people raised and &quot;nurtured by love&quot; in his method would grow up to achieve better things than war. One of his students during this post-1945 period was violinist Hidetaro Suzuki, no relation, who later became a veteran of international violin competitions (Tchaikovsky, Queen Elizabeth, Montreal International) and then the longtime concertmaster of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. (Hermann, 1981)

Eventually, the center of the Suzuki movement in education was established as the Talent Education Research Institute (TERI) in Matsumoto. TERI hosts thousands of people each year—students, parents, teachers, (and teacher trainees). Other organizations have sprung up all over the world to help oversee the movement and train teachers. These include the Asia Suzuki Association, the Suzuki Association of the Americas, the European Suzuki Association (which is currently assisting in the beginnings of the Suzuki movement in Africa), and the Pan-Pacific Suzuki Association.(International Suzuki Association, 2016).

John D. Kendall of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville brought the Suzuki method, along with adaptations to better fit the requirements of the American classroom, to the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s (&quot;Nurtured by Love&quot; Documentary). Vilem Sokol of the Seattle Youth Symphony hosted Suzuki in Seattle. The majority of American Suzuki pedagogues and teaching methods are grounded in the Suzuki-Kendall system. Other pioneers of the Suzuki Method in the US include Clifford Cook, Roland and Almita Vamos, Elizabeth and Harlow Mills, Betty Haag, Louise Behrend, Dorothy Roffman, William Starr, Anastasia Jempelis, and Margery Aber.

<text>The Northside () in an informal but commonly used term to describe the part of the city of Dublin that lies to the north of the River Liffey, and extending into part of North County Dublin. The part outside the city is within the county of Fingal, a local government area established in 1994. While it is sometimes regarded as less wealthy than the city&#x27;s Southside, the Northside was originally the home of the city&#x27;s upper classes and the more privileged of the two. Today, some of the wealthiest areas in Ireland, such as Malahide, Howth, Clontarf, and Castleknock, lie north of the river.

== Definition ==
Not being an administrative area, the Northside is variously defined. It generally includes those parts of Dublin city that lie north of the River Liffey. County Dublin settlements north of the M50 motorway, such as Swords and Malahide, which have developed into suburbs of Dublin city, are usually included.

==Popular culture==
James Joyce set several of the &quot;Dubliners&quot; stories on the Northside, reflecting his childhood sojourns in Drumcondra and Fairview. Among the more recent best-selling writers to have written extensively about the Northside are Dermot Bolger and Booker Prize winner Roddy Doyle, who set several of his novels in the fictional Northside area of Barrytown.

The soap opera &quot;Fair City&quot; is set in Carrigstown, a fictional suburb within Dublin&#x27;s Northside. According to the RTÉ Guide, Carrigstown is bounded by Drumcondra to the north, the city centre to the south, East Wall to the east and Phibsboro to the west.

== Areas of the Northside ==
The Northside includes Dublin city centre north of the Liffey, of whose many streets some are noted below, and districts such as Smithfield and Summerhill. Some older districts, such as Oxmantown, no longer exist. Beyond the centre, areas of the Northside include those listed below, most (at least two names were invented in the 1960s) of the names being of long heritage, though until recently many were rural townlands. Some are distinct suburbs or villages; others are parts of larger areas:

*Artane
*Arbour Hill
*Ashtown
*Balbriggan
*Ballybough
*Ballyboughal
*Baldoyle
*Balgriffin
*Ballygall
*Ballymun
*Bayside
*Beaumont
*Blanchardstown
*Broadstone
*Cabra
*Castleknock
*Clonee
*Clongriffin
*Clonsilla
*Clontarf
*Coolock
*Corduff
*Darndale
*Dollymount
*Donabate
*Donaghmede
*Donnycarney
*Drumcondra
*East Wall
*Fairview
*Finglas
*Glasnevin
*Grangegorman
*Harmonstown
*Howth
*Kilbarrack
*Killester
*Kilmore
*Kinsealy
*Malahide
*Marino
*Mulhuddart
*North Wall
*North Strand
*Ongar
*Oxmantown
*Phibsboro

*Raheny
*Santry
*Sheriff Street
*Skerries
*Smithfield
*Stoneybatter
*Strawberry Beds
*Sutton
*Summerhill
*Swords
*Tyrellstown
*Whitehall.
The area is administered both by Dublin City Council (formerly Dublin Corporation) and Fingal County Council, responsible for 84% and 16% respectively of the land area which lies inside the M50 motorway and north of the River Liffey (excluding the Howth peninsula).

== Postcodes ==

Traditionally, Dublin postal districts on the Northside begin with odd numbers, while those on the Southside begin with even numbers. For example, O&#x27;Connell Street is in Dublin 1, whereas the outer suburb of Ballymun is in Dublin 11. An exception is the Phoenix Park, which is on the Northside but is part of Dublin 8. The reason for this is explained by historian Pat Liddy: &quot;Long before there were postal codes, the James&#x27;s Street Postal Sorting Office looked after the Phoenix Park, because it was considered to be closer and more convenient than Phibsborough. James&#x27;s Street continued in this role when the postal codes were introduced, so Dublin 8 it had to be.&quot;

The Eircode system adopted for all postal addresses in Ireland in 2014 adapted the old postal districts for addresses in Dublin, with addresses in Dublin 1 having a prefix beginning D01, and Dublin 11 having a prefix beginning D11, etc. The outer edges of the Northside within the city and Fingal also contain all but one of the K Eircode areas. Swords, for example, is in Dublin K67, whereas Malahide is in the K36 area. The single exception to the rule is Lucan, which is in south-west Dublin and is designated as Dublin K78. Another quirk of the postal district system on the Northside is that the town of Clonee in Dublin&#x27;s neighbouring County Meath has the Eircode of D15.

An example of an address including the traditional Dublin postal district
: The Gresham Hotel
: 23 Upper O&#x27;Connell Street
: Dublin 1
: D01 C3W7.

An example of an address from outside the traditional postal districts: 
: Coffee Works
: 62 Main Street
: Swords
: County Dublin
: K67 RX94.

<doc id="382596" wikidata="Q3750998" url="?curid=382596" title="Southside, Dublin">
<text>The Southside () is the part of Dublin city that lies south of the River Liffey. It is an informal but commonly used term. In comparison to the city&#x27;s Northside, it has historically been regarded as wealthier and more privileged, with several notable exceptions. (Malahide, one of the wealthiest areas in Ireland, is on the Northside, for example, whereas low-income districts like Jobstown and Sallynoggin are south of the Liffey.) 

==Areas of the Southside==
The Southside includes Dublin city centre south of the Liffey, including Grafton Street and other notable streets, and also inner city areas such as The Liberties / The Coombe and Temple Bar.

Beyond the city centre, the Southside (in the geographical sense) includes the districts named here, most of the names being old, though many were until recent times rural townlands:


== Postcodes ==

Traditionally, Dublin postal districts on Southside begin with even numbers, while those of the Northside begin with odd numbers. College Green for example, is in the city&#x27;s D02 district—simply called &quot;Dublin 2&quot; in everyday speech—whereas the outer suburb of Tallaght is in D24. One exception to this rule is the Phoenix Park, which forms part of the even-numbered district D08, but is actually on the Northside. Historian Pat Liddy explains this discrepancy: &quot;Long before there were postal codes, the James&#x27;s Street Postal Sorting Office looked after the Phoenix Park, because it was considered to be closer and more convenient than Phibsborough. James&#x27;s Street continued in this role when the postal codes were introduced, so Dublin 8 it had to be.&quot; 

The outer edges of the Southside and substantial parts of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown contain those new &quot;A&quot; postcode areas that have been assigned to southern Dublin (some &quot;A&quot; areas are situated in County Wicklow and County Meath and others lie across the Liffey in northern Fingal). These are separate from the traditional postal districts but have been unified with them under the new Eircode system. Blackrock, for example, is in Dublin A94, whereas Dun Laoghaire is in the A96 area. Since Eircode was implemented, Southside postal addresses now take two general forms, depending on whether they lie within the traditional postal district area or not. This is an example of a postal address within the traditional Dublin postal districts:
: The Shelbourne Hotel,
: 27 St. Stephen&#x27;s Green, 
: Dublin 2,
: D02 K224.

And this is an example of a Southside postal address from outside the traditional postal districts:

: The Mellow Fig,
: 5A George&#x27;s Avenue,
: Blackrock,
: County Dublin,
: A94 XK11.

<text>The Union Bay Natural Area (UBNA) in Seattle, Washington, also known as Union Bay Marsh, is the restored remainder of the filled former Union Bay and Union Bay Marsh. It is located at the east end of the main University of Washington campus, south of NE 45th Street and west of Laurelhurst. Ravenna Creek is connected to University Slough (Drainage Canal), thence to Union Bay, and Lake Washington. Drainage Canal is one of three or four areas of open water connected with Lake Washington around Union Bay Marsh. The canal extends from NE 45th Street, between the driving range and IMA Sports Field 1, south to the bay, ending southeast of the Husky Ballpark baseball grandstand (northeast of the IMA Building). The Drainage Canal that carries Ravenna Creek past UBNA to Union Bay is locally sometimes called University Slough.
The little grasslands, modest ponds, and lake shoreline of the UBNA is a sanctuary for birds (including double-crested cormorants, great blue herons, and eagles); turtles and frogs may be seen. The UBNA is notable for diverse habitats including a good-sized lake, small permanent ponds, seasonal ponds, woods, sample prairie, and marshland. The interfaces among these make the area particularly attractive for birdwatching, with more than 150 species of birds sighted. The canal or slough was part of a restoration of the wetlands called Union Bay Marsh that had been drained by the opening of the Montlake Cut of the Lake Washington Ship Canal (1916) and much of Union Bay filled by the Montlake Dump,&lt;ref name=&quot;ubna/history&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (home of J. P. Patches, resident 1958–1981). Formerly the Montlake Landfill, University Dump, or Ravenna Landfill, it was used by the City of Seattle for residential and industrial solid waste from 1911 to 1966. It was fully closed five years later and overlaid with two feet of clean soil. Most of the land has been built upon by University Village (1956), UW athletic fields, buildings, and main parking lot E; the remainder comprises the UBNA, colloquially called &quot;the fill&quot;.
Before the lowering of Lake Washington during the early part of the 20th century, Ravenna and Yesler Creeks flowed into marshland north of where the canal now begins, and the land through which the canal would be cut lay under the waters of Union Bay. The Burke-Gilman Trail follows the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway line along the original shoreline of Union Bay past the UW power plant and University Village. Construction was completed in 2006 on a project that reconnects partially daylighted Ravenna Creek to Union Bay by piping it underground to the canal, thus converting the upper reach from a relatively stagnant drainage to the outlet for one of Seattle&#x27;s partially restored urban creeks. Daylighting from southeast Ravenna Park to the UW and the UBNA has been blocked by the owners of University Village

The UBNA is owned by the State of Washington and held under the aegis of the University of Washington; access is controlled. Parts of the Area are open during park hours, access to other portions is discouraged, some portions seasonally, for habitat or species protection.

Many restoration projects take place at UBNA. Removal of invasive species, such as Himalayan blackberry (&quot;Rubus armeniacus&quot;) and morning glory (&quot;Convolvulus arvensis&quot;), are part of a continual effort to restore the site to a natural area. Volunteers account for much of the progress in the Union Bay Natural Area.

<doc id="382598" wikidata="Q148621" url="?curid=382598" title="Dublin Bay">
<text>Dublin Bay () is a C-shaped inlet of the Irish Sea on the east coast of Ireland. The bay is about 10 kilometres wide along its north–south base, and 7 km in length to its apex at the centre of the city of Dublin; stretching from Howth Head in the north to Dalkey Point in the south. North Bull Island is situated in the northwest part of the bay, where one of two major inshore sand banks lay, and features a 5 km long sandy beach, Dollymount Strand, fronting an internationally recognised wildfowl reserve. Many of the rivers of Dublin reach the Irish Sea at Dublin Bay: the River Liffey, with the River Dodder flow received less than 1 km inland, River Tolka, and various smaller rivers and streams.

The metropolitan area of the city of Dublin surrounds three sides of the bay (the north, west, and south), while the Irish Sea lies to the east. Dublin was founded by the Vikings at the point where they were able to ford the River Liffey with the first wattle bridge up from the estuary. The city spread from its birthplace, around what is now the James&#x27;s Gate area, out along the coastline, northeast towards Howth and southeast towards Dalkey.

UNESCO has designated Dublin Bay a &#x27;biosphere reserve&#x27; in recognition of its unique ecological habitat and biological diversity; the bay is also covered by multiple other official and protective designations.

==Features==
The bay is rather shallow with many sandbanks and rocky outcrops, and was notorious in the past for shipwrecks, especially when the wind was from the east. Until modern times, many ships and their passengers were lost along the treacherous coastline from Howth to Dun Laoghaire, less than a kilometre from shore. Early maps of the bay carefully show narrow shipping channels and mooring areas.

===Sand banks and islands===
The bay had two inshore sand banks, the North Bull and the South Bull. With the building of the Bull Wall, the North Bull began to build up rapidly, forming North Bull Island (often simply &quot;Bull Island&quot;). A southern wall had earlier been built – the Great South Wall – but did not result in island formation, the South Bull remaining today an area of mud flats and strand. In addition there are several offshore sandbanks, notably Kish Bank (on which a lighthouse stands). Another sand bank-turned-island, Clontarf or Mud Island, shown on earlier maps, has disappeared.

===Coastline===
From north to south, Dublin Bay features beaches at Sutton Strand, Dollymount Strand on North Bull Island, Sandymount, Seapoint and south of Dun Laoghaire. The remaining coast is either rocky (with cliffs on Howth Head, for example) or mud coming up to sea walls. In most parts, the land slopes gently down to the sea, but aside from Howth Head, there are bluffs along much of the Raheny coastline, and the sharper slopes just inland at Monkstown and Old Dunleary.

===Inflows===
By far the most significant inflow is that of the River Liffey, with the waters of its many tributaries, including the Dodder, Poddle and Camac. Entering between East Wall and Clontarf is the second of Dublin&#x27;s rivers by volume, the River Tolka. Other flows into the bay include two streams in Sutton, one at Kilbarrack, four crossing Raheny, and one each in Clontarf, Sandymount, Merrion, Booterstown and Blackrock, as well as two in greater Dún Laoghaire. The Liffey and the Tolka have experienced a massive improvement in water quality in recent decades, but there are still occasional problems with some of the smaller watercourses, such as the Santry River, Naniken River and Elm Park and Trimleston Streams.

===Poolbeg stacks===
One dominating feature of the skyline round the bay are the chimney stacks of the Poolbeg Generating Station which have become a protected structure since 2014.

==History==

Dublin Bay was first settled c. 4000 BC, in Ireland&#x27;s Mesolithic. Ptolemy&#x27;s map of Ireland (AD 140)places a settlement called &quot;Eblana&quot; and a river Oboka in the region of Dublin Bay. In the 9th century AD, the Vikings settled and formed the Kingdom of Dublin.

As a port for seagoing vessels, Dublin had, prior to the eighteenth century, laboured under serious disadvantages. The Bar of Dublin, an infamous sandbar spreading across the mouth of the Liffey between the great sandbanks known as the North and South Bull (a short distance east of Sutton, and due north of Dún Laoghaire) was only covered by six feet of water at low tide. During the first half of the seventeenth century, this had necessitated for ships of any considerable draught to unload parts of their cargoes at Dalkey before carrying on. It was not until 19 September 1662 that the Privy Council of Ireland, by an order, appointed &#x27;Custom House Quay&#x27; (now Wellington Quay), located up the River Liffey in the city centre, as the sole place for landing and loading the imports and exports of Dublin. The original Custom House was erected at the quay sometime later in 1707.

The bay was charted and mapped by William Bligh at the start of the nineteenth century. Bligh also proposed improvements to Dublin Port and a refuge harbour at Dún Laoghaire.

Over 500 crew and passengers (mostly military personnel) were lost when the steamship was torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat on 10 October 1918. She lies in of water at .

In 1972, the Dublin Port and Docks Board proposed building an oil refinery in Dublin Bay. The plan was vigorously opposed by environmentalists, including Dublin City Councillor Seán D. Loftus, on the grounds that it posed a serious risk of pollution. Loftus, a lifelong campaigner for Dublin Bay, changed his name by deed poll to &quot;Seán Dublin Bay Loftus&quot; when standing for election to the Dáil. Although he was not elected, he succeeded in publicising the issue and the proposal was eventually turned down by the Minister for Local Government, James Tully. (Loftus later changed his name by deed poll to &quot;Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus&quot; as part of a campaign to press the Irish Government to make a territorial claim to the Rockall islet off the coast of County Donegal). Loftus also led opposition to the 2002 and subsequent applications by the Dublin Port Company to fill in of Dublin Bay. Other suggestions for the bay have included a proposal to build giant underwater gas storage tanks, and to infill the near-lagoon behind North Bull Island to form a leisure park.

===Infill===

In the summer of 2010, An Bord Pleanála refused permission to the Dublin Port Company to proceed with its plans to infill a further of Dublin Bay. The proposed infill, which has been vehemently opposed by residents, politicians, environmentalists and others around the bay for over 20 years, was refused on one point. An Bord Pleanála rejected nine out of ten of its own inspector&#x27;s recommendations for refusal, but refused permission on the basis that it was not satisfied that the proposed development would not adversely affect the integrity of the South Dublin Bay and River Tolka Estuary proposed Special Protection Area and adversely affect the natural heritage of Dublin Bay. Within a few months of the decision, the Dublin Port Company applied for and received a pre-application meeting with An Bord Pleanála. The Dublin Port Company has redrafted their proposal in relation to the SPA boundary and may resubmit an application for the project.

==Shipping and navigation==

Dublin Bay has a significant flow of shipping, mostly freight but also including passenger (car) ferries and cruise ships. The port authority offers pilotage where needed. Multiple lighthouses help secure passage, and the Commissioners of Irish Lights have their headquarters at Dún Laoghaire within the bay.

==Flooding==
Coastal flooding can occur at high tide at several points, notably the city side of Clontarf, and Sandymount.

==Pollution==
The bay has been subject to pollution from the inflowing watercourses, shipping and port activity, the main water treatment plant for Dublin and sewage discharges at other points, and at times some of its bathing areas are unavailable.

==Designations==
Parts of the bay are designated and protected in various ways, including:
* Proposed NHA - North and South Dublin Bay
* Special Area of Conservation - North and South Dublin Bay, and a corridor from Rockabill Island (north of the bay) to Dalkey Island
* Special Protection Area - North Bull Island, and a stretch from the estuary of the River Tolka to Sandymount Strand
* Ramsar and Biosphere Reserve - North Bull Island

==Sport and leisure==
Dublin Bay supports a wide range of leisure activities, from swimming through kayaking, yachting, kite-surfing to diving.

==Popular culture==
James Joyce set much of the action in his novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; around the bay, from the Forty Foot bathing place—in which the character Buck Mulligan washed on Bloomsday morning—to Howth, where Leopold Bloom made love to his wife Molly under the rhododendrons.

<doc id="382599" wikidata="Q13030962" url="?curid=382599" title="Convenience food">
<text>Convenience food (also called tertiary processed food) is food that is commercially prepared (often through processing) for ease of consumption, and is usually ready to eat without further preparation. It may also be easily portable, have a long shelf life, or offer a combination of such convenient traits. Convenience foods include ready-to-eat dry products, frozen food such as TV dinners, shelf-stable food, prepared mixes such as cake mix, and snack food. Food scientists now consider most of these products to be ultra-processed foods and link them to poor health outcomes.

Bread, cheese, salted food and other prepared foods have been sold for thousands of years, but these typically require a much lower level of industrial processing, as reflected in systems such as the Nova classification. Other types of food were developed with improvements in food technology. Types of convenience foods can vary by country and geographic region. Some convenience foods have received criticism due to concerns about nutritional content and how their packaging may increase solid waste in landfills. Various methods are used to reduce the unhealthy aspects of commercially produced food and fight childhood obesity.

Convenience food is commercially prepared for ease of consumption. Products designated as convenience food are often sold as hot, ready-to-eat dishes; as room-temperature, shelf-stable products; or as refrigerated or frozen food products that require minimal preparation (typically just heating). Convenience foods have also been described as foods that have been created to &quot;make them more appealing to the consumer.&quot; Convenience foods and restaurants are similar in that they save time. They differ in that restaurant food is ready to eat, whilst convenience food usually requires rudimentary preparation. Both typically cost more money and less time compared to home cooking from scratch.

==History==
Throughout history, people have bought food from bakeries, creameries, butcher shops and other commercial processors to save time and effort. The Aztec people of Central Mexico utilized several convenience foods that required only adding water for preparation, which were used by travelers. Cornmeal that was ground and dried, referred to as &quot;pinolli&quot;, was used by travelers as a convenience food in this manner.

Canned food was developed in the 19th century, primarily for military use, and became more popular during World War I. The expansion of canning depended significantly upon the development of canneries for producing large quantities of cans very cheaply. Before the 1850s, making a can for food required a skilled tinsmith; afterwards, an unskilled laborer, operating a can-making machine, could produce 15 times as many cans each day.

One of the earliest industrial-scale processed foods was meatpacking. After the invention of a system of refrigerator cars in 1878, animals could be raised, slaughtered, and butchered hundreds (later thousands) of miles or kilometers away from the consumer.

Experience in World War II contributed to the development of frozen foods and the frozen food industry. Modern convenience food saw its beginnings in the United States during the period that began after World War II. Many of these products had their origins in military-developed foods designed for storage longevity and ease of preparation in the battle field. Following the war, several commercial food companies had leftover manufacturing facilities, and some of these companies created new freeze-dried and canned foods for home use. Like many product introductions, not all were successful—convenience food staples such as fish sticks and canned peaches were counterbalanced by failures such as ham sticks and cheeseburgers-in-a-can. However, this new focus on convenience foods and the use of technology in the kitchen alleviated labor that was traditionally carried out by women, and therefore meals that could be prepared quickly enabled women to exercise more control over their time.
As of the 2010s due to increased preference for fresh, &quot;natural&quot;, whole, and organic food and health concerns the acceptability of processed food to consumers in the United States was dropping and the reputation of major packaged food brands had been damaged. Firms responded by offering &quot;healthier&quot; formulations and acquisition of brands with better reputations.

==Types==
Convenience foods can include products such as candy; beverages such as soft drinks, juices and milk; nuts, fruits and vegetables in fresh or preserved states; processed meats and cheeses; and canned products such as soups and pasta dishes. Additional convenience foods include frozen pizza, chips such as potato chips (known in Britain as crisps), pretzels, and cookies.

These products are often sold in portion-controlled, single-serving packaging designed for portability.

===Packaged mixes===

Gristmills have produced flour for baking for thousands of years. In more recent times flour has been sold with other ingredients mixed in, as have other products ready to cook. Packaged mixes are convenience foods which typically require some preparation and cooking either in the oven or on the stove top.

Packaged baked goods mixes typically use chemical leaveners (commonly referred to as baking powder), for a quick, reliable result, avoiding the requirement for time-consuming skilled labor and the climate control needed for traditional yeast breads. These packaged mixes produce a type of quickbread.

Examples include cake mixes, macaroni and cheese, brownie mixes, and gravy mixes. Some packaged mixes may have a high saturated fat content.

===By country===

In 2007, it was noted in the book &quot;Australia&#x27;s food &amp; nutrition 2012&quot; that a distinct increase in convenience food consumption had been occurring in Australia.

In the Republic of Ireland, breakfast rolls eaten by busy workers became a symbol of the Celtic Tiger economic boom.

In Japan, onigiri (rice balls) are a popular convenience food that dates for millennia — by the Heian period these were established enough to be mentioned in literature. Additional Japanese convenience foods include prepared tofu (bean curd), prepared packages of seafood and instant ramen noodles.

In the Philippines, ready-to-consume packages of traditional Filipino dishes such as sisig, adobo, and caldereta are popular products offered by convenience stores across the country.

Canned tuna packed in oil is a convenience food in the Solomon Islands.

In Russia, frozen pelmeni, a type of meat dumplings, adopted from Uralic peoples such as Komi, Mansi and Udmurts, are known from at least the 18th century, and industrially produced and prepacked pelmeni are a staple of the supermarket freezer sections.

===By region===
In Western Africa, processed cassava flour that has been grated and dried is a popular convenience food.

==Retail==
In some instances, retail sales of convenience foods may provide higher profit margins for food retailers compared to the profits attained from sales of the individual ingredients that are present in the convenience foods.

A survey in 1984 attributed over one-third of funds spent by consumers for food in Britain to be for convenience food purchases.

==Environmental and health concerns==

Several groups have cited the environmental harm of single serve packaging due to the increased usage of plastics that contributes to solid waste in landfills. Due to concerns about obesity and other health problems, some health organizations have criticized the high fat, sugar, salt, food preservatives and food additives that are present in some convenience foods.

In most developed countries, 80% of consumed salt comes from industry-prepared food (5% come from natural salt; 15% comes from salt added during cooking or eating). Health effects of salt concentrate on sodium and depend in part on how much is consumed. A single serving of many convenience foods contains a significant portion of the recommended daily allowance of sodium. Manufacturers are concerned that if the taste of their product is not optimized with salt, it will not sell as well as competing products. Tests have shown that some popular packaged foods depend on significant amounts of salt for their palatability.

==Labeling, mitigation, and regulation==

In response to the issues surrounding the healthfulness of convenience and restaurant foods, an initiative in the United States, spearheaded by Michelle Obama and her &quot;Let&#x27;s Move!&quot; campaign, to reduce the unhealthy aspects of commercially produced food and fight childhood obesity, was unveiled by the White House in February 2010. Mrs. Obama has pushed the industry to cut back on sugars and salts found in many convenience foods, encouraging self-regulation over government intervention through laws and regulations. Despite Mrs. Obama&#x27;s stated preference on self-regulation, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it was looking into quantifying the guidelines into law while other groups and municipalities are seeking to add other preventive measures such as target taxes and levies onto these products.

In response to the attention, in April 2010 a coalition of sixteen manufacturers all agreed to reduce salt levels in foods sold in the United States under a program based on a similar effort in the United Kingdom. However, the initiative has met with resistance from some manufacturers, who claim that processed foods require the current high levels of salt to remain appetizing and to mask undesirable effects of food processing such as &quot;warmed-over flavor&quot;. The coalition expanded its mission in May 2010 by announcing that it intends to reduce the amount of calories in foods. By introducing lower calorie foods, changing product recipes and reducing portion sizes, the coalition stated that it expected to reduce the caloric content of foods by more than 1.5 trillion calories in total by 2012.

== Social inequality ==

As previously stated, convenience foods cover a variety of food groups and come in numerous forms. Thus, there are a variety of healthy and unhealthy convenience foods. Research such as the 2002 study by Kimberly Morland et al., have correlated inequalities between low-income communities and increased access to unhealthy convenience foods. This is mostly due to the decline of affordable grocery stores in some urban areas. Comparing low-income communities to more affluent communities, there are four times more supermarkets located in white communities than the black communities (commonly found in food deserts). As a result, the 2002 study concluded that with limited access to healthy food options in supermarkets, members within the low-income and minority communities have unequal access. A 2010 study by Dharma E. Cortes et al. also found a connection between consumption of unhealthy convenience food and minority communities. Limited access to healthy food options has resulted in an increase in obesity amongst members in these communities.

Many low-income families struggle with buying fresh fruits and vegetables and nutritional meals for their families because of the price of the products. These families are most often located in food deserts and fresh food is not readily available in their community. Thus, families resort to buying food that is high in fat, sugar, and salt because these highly processed options are inexpensive. These highly processed foods make up a significant portion of unhealthy convenience foods.

<text>The Caecilii Metelli were one of the most important families of the late Roman Republic. They rose to prominence in the beginning of the third century, with the consulship of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Denter in 284 BC. It was however Quintus Caecilius Metellus, consul in 143, who greatly improved the prestige of the family, notably thanks to his victory during the Fourth Macedonian War, for which he received the &quot;agnomen&quot; Macedonicus. His descendants and those of his younger brother Lucius received an astonishing number of magistracies during the last century of the Republic.

==&quot;Stemma&quot;==
The overall structure of the &quot;stemma&quot; is taken from the one drawn by Münzer in the &quot;Realencyclopädie&quot;, which has recently been reproduced by Karl-J. Hölkeskamp&quot;.&quot; T. P. Wiseman made some important corrections in two articles on the descendants of Balearicus and the later Metelli, which have been included. 

The &quot;nomen&quot; Caecilius is omitted for all the men named Metellus. All dates are BC, except stated otherwise. Numbers in brackets indicates the order of marriages. Dotted lines show adoptions.

<doc id="382603" wikidata="Q116351" url="?curid=382603" title="Mitsuo Fuchida">
<text>was a Japanese captain in the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and a bomber observer in the Imperial Japanese Navy before and during World War II. He is perhaps best known for leading the first wave of air attacks on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Working under the overall fleet commander, Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, Fuchida was responsible for the coordination of the entire aerial attack.

After the war ended, Fuchida became a Christian convert and evangelist, traveling across the United States and Europe to tell his story. He later settled in the U.S. (although never taking American citizenship for himself). Some of Fuchida&#x27;s wartime claims have been challenged as self-serving by historians, including his claimed advocacy for a third wave attack on Pearl Harbor.

==Early life and education==
Mitsuo Fuchida was born in what is now part of Katsuragi, Nara Prefecture, Japan to Yazo and Shika Fuchida on 3 December 1902. He entered the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima, Hiroshima, in 1921, where he befriended classmate Minoru Genda and discovered an interest in flying. Specializing in horizontal bombing, Fuchida was made an instructor in that technique in 1936. He gained combat experience during the Second Sino-Japanese War, when he was assigned to the aircraft carrier in 1929 and then to the Sasebo Air Group, He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 December 1936 and was accepted into the Naval Staff College. Fuchida joined the aircraft carrier in 1939 as the commander of the air group. Fuchida was made commander in October 1941.

== World War II ==
=== Pearl Harbor ===

On Sunday, 7 December 1941, a Japanese force under the command of Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo—consisting of six carriers with 423 aircraft—was ready to attack the United States base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. At 06:00, the first wave of 183 dive bombers, torpedo bombers, horizontal bombers and fighters took off from carriers north of Oahu and headed for the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor.

At 07:40 Hawaiian Standard Time, Mitsuo Fuchida, who by this time had achieved the rank of commander, arrived with the first attack wave on Oahu&#x27;s north shore near Kahuku Point. The first attack wave then banked west and flew along the northwest coast. Fuchida ordered &quot;Tenkai&quot; (Take attack position), and upon seeing no U.S. activity at Pearl Harbor, Fuchida slid back the canopy of his Nakajima B5N2 torpedo bomber, tailcode &quot;AI-301&quot;, and fired a single dark blue flare known as a &quot;black dragon&quot;, the signal to attack.

Passing Waimea Bay at 07:49, Fuchida instructed his radio operator, Petty Officer 1st Class Norinobu Mizuki, to send the coded signal &quot;To, To, To&quot; (&quot;totsugekiseyo&quot;—&quot;to charge&quot;) to the other aircraft. Fuchida, thinking Lt Cmdr Shigeru Itaya&#x27;s Zeroes had missed the signal, fired a second flare. Lt Cmdr Kakuichi Takahashi, overall leader of the first wave dive bombers, saw both flares and misunderstood the signal. Thinking the dive bombers were to attack, he led his dive bombers into immediate attack position. Lt Cmdr Shigeharu Murata, overall leader of the torpedo bombers, observed both flares and saw Takahashi&#x27;s planes gliding into attack formation. He knew there was a misunderstanding which could not be rectified, so he led his torpedo bombers into attack positions. At this point, Cmdr Fuchida&#x27;s pilot, Lieutenant Mitsuo Matsuzaki, guided their bomber along with the remaining horizontal bombers in a formation sweep around Kaena Point and headed down the western coast of Oahu.

At 07:53, Fuchida ordered Mizuki to send the code words &quot;&quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; back to the carrier &quot;Akagi&quot;, the flagship of 1st Air Fleet. The message meant that complete surprise had been achieved. Due to favorable atmospheric conditions, the transmission of the &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;&quot; code words from the moderately powered transmitter were heard over a ship&#x27;s radio in Japan by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the naval commander, and his staff, who were sitting up through the night awaiting word on the attack.

As the first wave returned to the carriers, Fuchida remained over the target to assess damage and observe the second-wave attack. He returned to his carrier only after the second wave had completed its mission. With great pride, he announced that the U.S. battleship fleet had been destroyed. Fuchida inspected his craft and found 21 large flak holes: the main control wires were barely holding together. The successful attack made Fuchida a national hero who was granted a personal audience with Emperor Hirohito.

=== Other actions ===
On 19 February 1942, Fuchida led the first of two waves of 188 aircraft in a devastating air raid on Darwin, Australia. On 5 April, he led another series of air attacks by carrier-based Japanese aircraft against Royal Navy bases in Ceylon, which was the headquarters of the British Eastern Fleet, in what Winston Churchill described as &quot;the most dangerous moment&quot; of World War II.

On 4 June 1942, while on board &quot;Akagi&quot;, Fuchida was wounded at the Battle of Midway. Unable to fly while recovering from an emergency shipboard appendectomy a few days before the battle, he was on the ship&#x27;s bridge during the morning attacks by U.S. aircraft. After &quot;Akagi&quot; was hit, a chain reaction from burning fuel and live bombs began the destruction of the ship. When flames blocked the exit from the bridge, the officers evacuated down a rope, and as Fuchida slid down, an explosion threw him to the deck and broke both his ankles.

=== Staff officer ===

After spending several months recuperating, Fuchida spent the rest of the war in Japan as a staff officer. On 15 October 1944, he was promoted to captain. The day before the first nuclear weapon was dropped on Hiroshima, he was in that city to attend a week-long military conference with Japanese army officers. Fuchida received a long-distance phone call from Navy Headquarters asking him to return to Tokyo. The day after the bombing, he returned to Hiroshima with a party sent to assess the damage. Many members of Fuchida&#x27;s party later died of radiation poisoning, but Fuchida exhibited no symptoms. Fuchida&#x27;s military career ended with his demobilization in November 1945 during the American-led occupation of Japan.

== Postwar activities ==
After the war, Fuchida was called on to testify at the trials of some of the Japanese military for Japanese war crimes. This infuriated him, as he believed this was little more than &quot;victors&#x27; justice&quot;. In the spring of 1947, convinced that the U.S. had treated the Japanese the same way and determined to bring that evidence to the next trial, Fuchida went to Uraga Harbor near Yokosuka to meet a group of returning Japanese prisoners of war. He was surprised to find his former flight engineer, Kazuo Kanegasaki, who all had believed had died in the Battle of Midway. When questioned, Kanegasaki told Fuchida that they were not tortured or abused, much to Fuchida&#x27;s surprise. He then went on to tell him of a young lady, Peggy Covell, who served them with the deepest love and respect, but whose missionary parents had been killed by Japanese soldiers on the island of Panay in the Philippines.

For Fuchida, this was inexplicable, as in the &quot;Bushido&quot; code revenge was not only permitted, it was &quot;a responsibility&quot; for an offended party to carry out revenge to restore honor. The murderer of one&#x27;s parents would be a sworn enemy for life. He became almost obsessed trying to understand why anyone would treat their enemies with love and forgiveness.

In the fall of 1948, Fuchida was passing by the bronze statue of Hachikō at the Shibuya Station when he was handed a pamphlet about the life of Jacob DeShazer, a member of the Doolittle Raid who was captured by the Japanese after his B-25 bomber ran out of fuel over occupied China. In the pamphlet, &quot;I Was a Prisoner of Japan&quot; DeShazer, a former U.S. Army Air Forces staff sergeant and bombardier, told his story of imprisonment, torture and his account of an &quot;awakening to God.&quot; This experience increased Fuchida&#x27;s curiosity of the Christian faith. In September 1949, after reading the Bible for himself, he became a Christian. In May 1950, Fuchida and DeShazer met for the first time. Fuchida created the Captain Fuchida Evangelistical Association based in Seattle, Washington and spoke full-time of his conversion to the Christian faith in presentations titled &quot;From Pearl Harbor To Calvary&quot;.

In 1951, Fuchida, along with a colleague, published an account of the Battle of Midway from the Japanese side. In 1952, he toured the United States as a member of the Worldwide Christian Missionary Army of Sky Pilots. Fuchida remained dedicated to a similar initiative as the group for the remainder of his life.

In February 1954, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; published Fuchida&#x27;s story of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Fuchida also wrote and co-wrote books, including &quot;From Pearl Harbor to Golgotha&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;From Pearl Harbor to Calvary&quot;, and a 1955 expansion of his 1951 book &quot;Midway&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Midway: The Battle that Doomed Japan, the Japanese Navy&#x27;s Story&quot;. His autobiography, titled &quot;Shinjuwan Kogeki no Sotaicho no Kaiso&quot;, was published in Japan in 2007. This was translated into English by Douglas Shinsato and Tadanori Urabe and published in 2011 under the title, &quot;For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor&quot;. Fuchida&#x27;s story is also recounted in &quot;God&#x27;s Samurai: Lead Pilot at Pearl Harbor&quot; by Donald Goldstein, Katherine V. Dillon and Gordon W. Prange.

In 1959, Fuchida was among a group of Japanese visiting the tour of U.S. Air Force equipment given by General Paul Tibbets, who piloted the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Fuchida recognized Tibbets and had a conversation with him. Tibbets said to Fuchida that &quot;[y]ou sure did surprise us [at Pearl Harbor]&quot; in which he replied &quot;what do you think you did to us [at Hiroshima]?&quot; Fuchida further told him that:

According to Fuchida&#x27;s son, his father had a green card allowing permanent residence in the U.S. but he never obtained U.S. citizenship. This is contrary to the assertions of several authors.

Fuchida died of complications caused by diabetes in Kashiwara, near Osaka on 30 May 1976 at the age of 73.

== Published works ==
Fuchida was the author of three books: one on the Battle of Midway, one a memoir, and one on his conversion to Christianity.
* &quot;Midway: The Battle that Doomed Japan, the Japanese Navy&#x27;s Story&quot; (Naval Institute Press, 2000) was coauthored with Masatake Okumiya. In a section entitled &quot;Five Fateful Minutes&quot;, Fuchida (as translated) writes &quot;Five minutes! Who would have believed that the tide of battle would shift in that brief interval of time? ... We had been caught flatfooted in the most vulnerable condition possible—decks loaded with planes armed and fueled for attack.&quot; Later scholarship (Parshall et al.) dispute Fuchida&#x27;s description. (Edited by Clarke H. Kawakami and Roger Pineau; )
* &quot;For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, the Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor&quot; (eXperience, Incorporated, 2011) was his memoir. In it, Fuchida makes a claim that has not been corroborated by others: &quot;In my role as Staff of General Navy Headquarters, I was assigned miscellaneous tasks to help the Japanese side&#x27;s preparations. Since I was not an official attaché, I was watching the signing ceremony from the upper deck along with the crews of the &quot;USS Missouri&quot;.&quot; (Translated by Douglas T. Shinsato and Tadanori Urabe; )
* &quot;From Pearl Harbor to Calvary&quot; (Pickle Partners Publishing, March 28, 2016, ), originally published as &quot;From Pearl Harbor to Golgotha&quot;, is the story of Fuchida&#x27;s Christian conversion.

== Historical controversy ==
Fuchida was an important figure in the early portion of the Pacific War, and his written accounts, translated into English and published in the U.S., were highly influential. However, the veracity of Fuchida&#x27;s statements on several topics has been subsequently called into question. This process began in Japan in 1971, with the publication of the Japanese official war history volume on the Battle of Midway, which explicitly contradicted Fuchida&#x27;s version of events.

In 2001, historians H.P. Willmott and Haruo Tohmatsu in their &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, dismissed Fuchida&#x27;s rendition of having demanded a third-wave against Pearl Harbor&#x27;s fuel tanks as &quot;blatant and shameless self-advertisement&quot; regarding &quot;an episode which never took place.&quot; These criticisms were repeated by historian Jonathan Parshall and Mark Stille&#x27;s &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora! Pearl Harbor 1941&quot;. Alan Zimm&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Attack on Pearl Harbor: Strategy, Combat, Myths, Deceptions&quot;, reinforced and enlarged these earlier criticisms and added new charges, including Fuchida having fabricated a battle damage assessment that was presented to Emperor Hirohito. Zimm subsequently accused Fuchida of lying about important decisions and signals he made as strike leader immediately prior to the attack, while blaming others for his own errors. 

With respect to the Battle of Midway, Fuchida&#x27;s account of the readiness of the Japanese counterstrike aircraft during the American dive-bomber attack has been disputed by historians Parshall and Anthony Tully in their 2005 work &quot;Shattered Sword&quot;, as well as Dallas Isom&#x27;s &quot;Midway Inquest&quot;, Craig Symonds&#x27; &quot;The Battle of Midway&quot;, and Evan Mawdsley, with Mawdsley noting &quot;Parshall and Tully compellingly contradict Fuchida.&quot; Parshall also disputed Fuchida&#x27;s uncorroborated claims of attendance on the battleship during the Japanese surrender ceremony in 1945, these criticisms being later amplified by Zimm.

== Portrayals ==
In the 1970 film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, Fuchida was portrayed by Japanese actor Takahiro Tamura.

== Auction ==
Fuchida&#x27;s hand-drawn map showing the post-Pearl Harbor attack destruction sold at auction for $425,000 in New York City on 6 December 2013. The map had previously been owned by Malcolm Forbes.

The map was purchased by the Jay I. Kislak foundation, who then donated it to Miami-Dade Library. The library then sold it to the Library of Congress in 2018.

<doc id="382606" wikidata="Q7695837" url="?curid=382606" title="Telecom Éireann">
<text>Telecom Éireann (; meaning &quot;Telecommunications of Ireland&quot;) was an Irish state-owned telecommunications company that operated from 1983 to 1999. Prior to then a telephone and postal service was provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (known as &quot;P and T&quot; or &quot;P⁊T&quot; in Gaelic script), as part of the civil service. Telecom Éireann was established by the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983; its full formal title was &quot;Bord Telecom Éireann or, in the English language, The Irish Telecommunications Board&quot;. &quot;Telecom Éireann&quot; may be translated as &quot;Telecom of Ireland&quot;. In 1999, the company was privatised and renamed as &quot;eircom&quot;.

==Upgrading the network==

Telecom Éireann rolled out digital telephone switching technology, across the country along with an extensive fibre optic and digital microwave backbone. Two digital switching systems were selected; CIT-Alcatel&#x27;s E10 and Ericsson&#x27;s AXE telephone exchange.
Digital technology quickly replaced analogue systems at national and major regional switching centres and new international gateway switches were installed. The oldest electromechanical step-by-step exchanges and manual operator-manned local exchanges were the first to be converted to digital technology. More modern electromechanical crossbar exchanges, using Ericsson ARF, Hitachi and ITT Pentaconta technology dating from the 1960s and 1970s were converted to digital bit by bit through the late 1980s and early 1990s. These crossbar switches were capable of providing voice service that was comparable to digital switching technology.

By the early 1990s, the Irish network was amongst the most modern and most digitalised in the world and by the mid-1990s and had become 100% digitally switched.

In June 1996, a strategic alliance was formed between Telecom Éireann of Ireland, Telia of Sweden and KPN of the Netherlands, after both companies purchased a combined 35 percent stake in Telcom Éireann. The alliance was completed by 2001, when Telia and KPN exited Ireland. During the time of the alliance it was headquartered in St Stephens Green and Harcourt Street, Dublin.

The company also did a major upgrade to the payphone network in the late 1980s, which saw the rollout of smart card based payphones across Ireland. The Telecom Éireann CallCard was one of the earliest implementations chip-based cards in the world.

==Eircell==

Telecom Éireann launched Eircell (now Vodafone Ireland) in 1984, with operations commencing in 1986. The company deployed a national mobile telephone network based on a first generation mobile technology known as the Total Access Communication System, or TACS for short. This technology, similar to AMPS, was also used in the UK by Vodafone and Cellnet.
Eircell launched their digital network based on GSM technology from Ericsson in 1993.
GSM service rapidly replaced the TACS network as customers migrated over to new digital technology. Within a few years, the TACS network was obsolete and taken off air.

==Other divisions==

*Minitel Ireland (joint venture)
The company launched Minitel videotext system in Ireland in 1991 in a joint venture with France Telecom, AIB and Crédit Lyonnais. The system went live after 3 years of trials and development but due to poor uptake, probably due to its relatively late launch that coincided with the beginning of the Web, a more flexible system with a vast array of English-language content, it quickly faded from public attention. The Irish Minitel system had been planned as early as 1988 and envisioned building an ecosystem similar to its French counterpart, with shopping, banking and information services. Minitel Ireland was ultimately shut down due a small and dwindling user base.

*Telecom Internet
In 1997, Telecom Éireann established Telecom Internet also known as Tinet, the Internet service provider the company rapidly became one of the partners in the Internet Neutral Exchange and is today known as eircom net.

*Eirpage
Telecom Éireann established Eirpage, a national paging system in Ireland.

This system was then controlled and operated by Voxpro Communications, formerly Pageboy (www.voxpro.ie) until the closure of the National Paging System in August 2011.

*Eirpac
Launched in 1984 to replace Euronet, Eirpac is the Irish public switched data network supporting X.25 and X.28

*TEIS (Telecom Éireann Information Systems)
This unit sold business systems and office telephone systems to business customers.

*TeleCentre – this was Telecom Éireann&#x27;s retail arm, which was later renamed eircom Store and then shut down as eircom moved away from physical customer contact centres. Since the closure of the stores, customers can only contact eircom online or by telephone.
*Phonewatch – Provides monitored alarm services to both residential and business customers. The company was rebranded as eircom PhoneWatch. It is one of the largest players in the Irish home security market and was sold to a Norwegian company in 2012.

==Support==
In 1988, it sponsored RTÉ Weather until 1999.

==Privatisation==

Telecom Éireann was privatised in 1999 and renamed as &quot;eircom&quot; plc. It was later split into &quot;Eircell 2000 plc&quot; (Eircell), the mobile networks business, and &quot;eircom&quot;, the fixed-line business which also inherited other minor divisions, such as the Eirpage pager system and the Telecom retail arm. Eircell was sold to Vodafone in May 2001, and later changed its name to the dual-brand Eircell Vodafone before becoming Vodafone Ireland.

<text>Eircell was an Irish mobile cellular network provider which was established in 1984, with operations commencing in 1986. Its access code was 088 for the original analogue TACS system and 087 for the later GSM system. Following the abolition of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Eircell fell under the remit of Telecom Éireann (Later Eircom), which today is known as Eir. The Eircell brand became defunct in 2002 following its acquisition by Vodafone. From 2001, Eircell underwent a major branding exercise after its acquisition by the Vodafone group in December 2000. The main branding was to associate a shade of deep purple with the company. When Vodafone rebranded with its trademark shade of red, the company commented that &quot;red is the new purple&quot;. The company was known as Eircell-Vodafone for some time as the process took nine months in total.

==History==

===Early stages of Eircell===
In the late 1980s, early adopters of the service numbered in their hundreds rather than thousands and paid handsomely for the phones that were available at the time through a network of independent retailers. The price for mobile phones ranged from IR£1500 to IR£2000 and &#x27;subscribers&#x27; were typically politicians or wealthy businessmen. The market-leading phone manufacturers in the early years of the Irish market were Nokia and Motorola.

===Popularity of the company rises===
In response to negative publicity about security compromises on the TACS system during the early 1990s, Eircell introduced Ireland&#x27;s first encrypted cellular phone called a Kokusai and it retailed in the region of IR£1400. Sales were poor partly because Eircell was not in the business of selling phones and because switching from encrypted to unencrypted was &#x27;messy&#x27;. As phone prices dropped and the network rolled out to more of Ireland, sales took off reaching a milestone 100,000 subscribers by 1995 and in 1997, Eircell launched Ireland&#x27;s first prepaid mobile phone service which was called &#x27;Ready To Go&#x27;. A year later, it launched its GSM 900 version (access code 087) which quickly took hold as users rapidly switched over to the new digital technology.

<doc id="382617" wikidata="Q1981272" url="?curid=382617" title="List of Syfy TV channels">
<text>Syfy (in some countries named Sci Fi) is a family of pay television channels that broadcast programming owned or licensed by entertainment NBCUniversal around the world using the Syfy brand which is focused on science fiction, fantasy, horror, supernatural and paranormal programming. The first such channel was launched in the United States on September 24, 1992. It was originally named &quot;Sci-Fi Channel&quot;. In 1995 it kicked off in the United Kingdom, followed by the Netherlands and Belgium in 1996.

The name Syfy was officially adopted on July 7, 2009, and most were renamed Syfy Universal during the early 2010s years. Exceptions to this renaming scheme included Syfy Channels in USA, Germany, France, Latin America, Spain, Portugal and future Syfy Channels in Canada, Cyprus, Israel, Nordic countries, South Africa, Türkiye and now defunct and replaced SF Australia (formerly Sci Fi Channel Australia) and Syfy UK, where the channel is simply called Syfy. Sci Fi Channels in Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and future Sci Fi Channels in Greece, Malta and now defunct Sci Fi Channel in Romania, became Sci Fi Universal due to &quot;syfy&quot; having a profane meaning in Polish. In 2017 the channel got rebranded and the &quot;Universal&quot; suffix was already dropped.

<doc id="382619" wikidata="Q1202833" url="?curid=382619" title="Frozen meal">
<text>A frozen meal (also called TV dinner in Canada and US), prepackaged meal, ready-made meal, ready meal (UK), frozen dinner, and microwave meal portioned for an individual. A frozen meal in the United States and Canada usually consists of a type of meat, fish, or pasta for the main course, and sometimes vegetables, potatoes, and/or a dessert. Some frozen meals feature Indian, Chinese, Mexican, and other foods of international customs.

The term &quot;TV dinner&quot;, which has become common, was first used as part of a brand of packaged meals developed in 1953 by the company C.A. Swanson &amp; Sons. The original &quot;TV Dinner&quot; came in an aluminum tray and was heated in an oven. In the US and Canada, the term is synonymous with any packaged meal or dish (&quot;dinner&quot;) purchased frozen in a supermarket and heated at home. In 1986, the Campbell Soup Company introduced the microwave-safe tray. Consequently, today, most frozen food trays are made of a microwaveable and disposable material, usually plastic or coated cardboard.

==History==

Several smaller companies had conceived of frozen dinners earlier (see Invention section below), but the first to achieve widespread and lasting success was Swanson. The first Swanson-brand TV Dinner was produced in the United States and consisted of a Thanksgiving meal of turkey, cornbread stuffing, frozen peas and sweet potatoes packaged in a tray like those used at the time for airline food service. Each item was placed in its own compartment. The trays proved to be useful: the entire dinner could be removed from the outer packaging as a unit, the tray with its aluminum foil covering could be heated directly in the oven without any extra dishes, and one could eat the meal directly from the tray. The product was cooked for 25 minutes at and fit onto a TV tray table. The original TV Dinner sold for 98 cents, and had a first production run of 5,000 dinners.

The name &quot;TV dinner&quot; was coined by Gerry Thomas, often considered its inventor. In an interview long after the product&#x27;s introduction, Thomas noted how televisions were &quot;magic&quot; status symbols, and he thought the name &quot;TV dinner&quot; could attach the attributes of a popular medium to a convenient food item. Another source postulates that the box of the TV dinner was made to look like a television, and that TV trays (folding tray table furniture) soon appeared on the market.

Much has changed since the first TV dinners were marketed. For instance, a wider variety of main courses – such as fried chicken, spaghetti, Salisbury steak and Mexican combinations – have been introduced. Competitors such as Banquet and Morton began offering prepackaged frozen dinners, too. Other changes include:
* 1960 – Swanson added desserts (such as apple cobbler and brownies) to a new four-compartment tray.
* 1969 – The first Swanson TV breakfasts were marketed. Great Starts Breakfasts and breakfast sandwiches (such as egg and Canadian bacon) followed later.
* 1973 – The first Swanson &quot;Hungry-Man&quot; dinners were marketed; these contained larger portions of its regular dinners. The American football player &quot;Mean&quot; Joe Greene was the &quot;Hungry-Man&quot; spokesman.
* 1986 – The first microwave oven-safe trays were marketed.

Modern-day frozen dinners tend to come in microwave-safe containers. Product lines also tend to offer a larger variety of dinner types. These dinners, also known as microwave meals, can be purchased at most supermarkets. They are stored frozen. To prepare them, the plastic cover is removed or vented, and the meal is heated in a microwave oven for a few minutes. They are convenient since they essentially require no preparation time other than the heating, although some frozen dinners may require the preparer to briefly carry out an intermediate step (such as stirring mashed potatoes midway through the heating cycle) to ensure adequate heating and uniform consistency of component items.

In the United Kingdom, prepared frozen meals first became widely available in the late 1970s. Since then they have steadily grown in popularity with the increased ownership of home freezers and microwave ovens. Demographic trends such as the growth of smaller households have also influenced the sale of this and other types of convenience food. In 2003, the United Kingdom spent £5 million a day on ready meals, and was the largest consumer in Europe.

Unfrozen pre-cooked ready meals, which are merely chilled and require less time to reheat, are also popular and are sold by most supermarkets. Chilled ready meals are intended for immediate reheating and consumption. Although most can be frozen by the consumer after purchase, they can either be heated from frozen or may have to be fully defrosted before reheating.

Many different varieties of frozen and chilled ready meals are now generally available in the UK, including &quot;gourmet&quot; recipes, organic and vegetarian dishes, traditional British and foreign cuisine, and smaller children&#x27;s meals.

==Invention==

The identity of the TV Dinner&#x27;s inventor has been disputed. In one account, first publicized in 1996, retired Swanson executive Gerry Thomas said he conceived the idea after the company found itself with a huge surplus of frozen turkeys because of poor Thanksgiving sales. Thomas&#x27; version of events has been challenged by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, members of the Swanson family and former Swanson employees. They credit the Swanson brothers with the invention.

Betty Cronin, a bacteriologist employed at C. A. Swanson and Sons, has also been credited with important contributions to the invention. She was involved in the technical design of dinner items that could be frozen then re-heated successfully.

Swanson&#x27;s concept was not original. In 1944, William L. Maxson&#x27;s frozen dinners were being served by the military and on airplanes. Other prepackaged meals were also marketed before Swanson&#x27;s TV Dinner. In 1948, plain frozen fruits and vegetables were joined by what were then called &#x27;dinner plates&#x27; with a main course, potato, and vegetable. In 1952, the first frozen dinners on oven-ready aluminum trays were introduced by Quaker State Foods under the One-Eyed Eskimo label, and by 1954 the company sold 2 million such dinners annually. Quaker State Foods was joined by other companies including Philadelphia-based Frigi-Dinner, which offered such fare as beef stew with corn and peas, veal goulash with peas and potatoes, and chicken chow mein with egg rolls and fried rice. Swanson, a large producer of canned and frozen poultry in Omaha, Nebraska, was able to promote the widespread sales and adaptation of frozen dinner by using its nationally recognized brand name with an extensive national marketing campaign nicknamed &quot;Operation Smash&quot; and the clever advertising name of &quot;TV Dinner,&quot; which tapped into the public&#x27;s excitement around the television.

==Manufacturing==
The production process of frozen meals is highly automated and undergoes three major steps. Those steps are food preparation, tray loading, and freezing. During food preparation, vegetables and fruits are usually placed on a movable belt and washed, then are placed into a container to be steamed or boiled for 1–3 minutes. This process is referred to as blanching, and is used as a method to destroy enzymes in the food that can cause chemical changes negatively affecting overall flavor and color of the fruit and vegetables. As for meats, prior to cooking, they are trimmed of fat and cut into proper sizes. The fish is usually cleaned and cut into fillets, and poultry is usually washed thoroughly and dressed. Meats are then seasoned, placed on trays, and are cooked in an oven for a predetermined amount of time. After all the food is ready to be packaged, it is sent to the filling lines. The food is placed in its compartments as the trays pass under numerous filling machines; to ensure that every packaged dinner gets an equal amount of food, the filling devices are strictly regulated.

The food undergoes a process of cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen. After the food is placed on the conveyor belt, it is sprayed with liquid nitrogen that boils on contact with the freezing food. This method of flash-freezing fresh foods is used to retain natural quality of the food. When the food is chilled through cryogenic freezing, small ice crystals are formed throughout the food that, in theory, can preserve the food indefinitely if stored safely. Cryogenic freezing is widely used as it is a method for rapid freezing, requires almost no dehydration, excludes oxygen thus decreasing oxidative spoilage, and causes less damage to individual freezing pieces. Due to the fact that the cost of operating cryogenic freezing is high, it is commonly used for high value food products such as TV dinners, which is a $4.5 billion industry a year that is continuing to grow with the constant introduction of new technology.

Following this, the dinners are either covered with aluminum foil or paper, and the product is tightly packed with a partial vacuum created to ensure no evaporation takes place that can cause the food to dry out. Then the packaged dinners are placed in a refrigerated storage facility, transported by refrigerated truck, and stored in the grocer&#x27;s freezer. TV dinners prepared with the aforementioned steps—that is, frozen and packaged properly—can remain in near-perfect condition for a long time, so long as they are stored at during shipping and storage.

==Health concerns==

Frozen meals are often heavily processed with extra salt and fat to make foods last longer. In addition, stabilizing the product for a long period typically means that companies will use partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for some items (typically dessert). Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are high in trans fats and are shown to adversely affect cardiovascular health. The dinners are almost always significantly less nutritious than fresh food and are formulated to remain edible after long periods of storage, thus often requiring preservatives such as butylated hydroxytoluene. There is, however, some variability between brands.

In recent years there has been a push by a number of independent manufacturers and retailers to make meals that are low in salt and fat and free of artificial additives. In the UK, most British supermarkets also produce their own &quot;healthy eating&quot; brands. Nearly all chilled or frozen ready meals sold in the UK are now clearly labeled with the salt, sugar and fat content and the recommended daily intake. Concern about obesity and government publicity initiatives such as those by the Food Standards Agency and the National Health Service have encouraged manufacturers to reduce the levels of salt and fat in ready prepared food.

<doc id="382624" wikidata="Q2900422" url="?curid=382624" title="Bewley's">
<text>Bewley&#x27;s is an Irish hot beverage company, located in Dublin and founded in 1840, which operates internationally. Its primary business operations are the production of tea and coffee, and the operations of cafés. Bewley&#x27;s has operations in Ireland, the UK and the United States; in the Boston area under the Rebecca&#x27;s Cafe name and in California as Java City.

==History==
The Bewley family were Quakers who originated in Cumberland and moved to Ireland in the 17th century. They entered the tea trade, and in 1835, Samuel Bewley and his son Charles landed 2,099 chests of tea shipped from Canton in China. The Bewley family subsequently expanded into the coffee trade and in the late 19th century, they opened cafes in South Great George&#x27;s Street in 1894, and Westmoreland Street in 1896. The flagship Grafton Street café was opened by Ernest Bewley in 1927. The Grafton Street building had once housed Whyte&#x27;s Academy, a school whose pupils included the Duke of Wellington and Robert Emmet.

In 1986 the company was taken over by Campbell Catering forming the Campbell Bewley Group. By 1999, the company operated more than twenty cafes in Ireland and six overseas. In 2010 they employed around 800 people worldwide, although 140 jobs were lost in early 2015 with the closure of the Bewley&#x27;s Oriental Café on Grafton Street in Dublin. In May 2018, Bewley&#x27;s launched 100% recyclable cups.

==Branches==

===Bewley&#x27;s Grafton Street===

The company has operated a café on Dublin&#x27;s Grafton Street since 1927. Sometimes described as a &quot;Dublin landmark&quot; the building shows influence from the Art Deco movement, with its façade decorated with an Egyptian Revival mosaic, a style rare in Dublin. It was designed by the Dublin architectural firm, Millar &amp; Symes. In the interior, there are stained glass windows by Harry Clarke showing orders of architecture. The windows are on the ground floor towards the back of the building. A stained glass window by artist Jim Fitzpatrick from the Mary Street branch was stored after its closure and then transferred to the remaining Grafton Street branch. A third stained glass artist&#x27;s work is included in the Grafton Street store, a window by Pauline Bewick entitled &quot;Cafe Society&quot;. The building was modified extensively in 1995.

This outlet was closed between November 2004 and May 2005 for refurbishment and restoration. In 2007, its lease was challenged by the landlord, Ickendel Limited, after extensive works were carried out without landlord consent. The Grafton Street premises closed again for more extensive refurbishment works from February 2015. By October 2015, Bewley&#x27;s announced that the length of the closure would extend, and by mid-2016, the date of reopening had been pushed back to the end of 2016. Ultimately, in November 2017, Bewley&#x27;s Grafton Street was reopened after the &quot;1000 day&quot; multimillion-euro refurbishment.

In May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, management informed staff that the Grafton Street café would close permanently &quot;in the coming weeks&quot;, leading to the loss of 110 jobs. However, in late July 2020, it was announced that it would re-open on a phased basis.

====Ownership of Harry Clarke stained glass====
The lease was subject to court proceedings from the landlord, as &quot;RGRE v Bewley&#x27;s&quot;, related to the Harry Clarke stained glass in the building.

The tenants maintained that the Clarke windows were artworks and not part of the building&#x27;s fabric, whereas the landlord maintained that they were. The Court of Appeal ruled in July 2024 that all of the six works were indeed part of the building so they could not be sold by the tenant.

===US and UK===
The company acquired the &quot;Rebecca&#x27;s Cafe&quot; chain in the Boston, Massachusetts area in 1997, and expanded to the west coast in 2000 with the purchase of the &quot;Java City&quot; brand.

Bewley&#x27;s entered the UK market in 2011 following the acquisition of speciality coffee supplier, Darlington&#x27;s before acquiring Bolling Coffee in 2013 and UK foodservice distributor, Peros in 2015.

===Former===
Bewley&#x27;s themselves operated a number of other branches in Dublin City Centre, including Fleet Street/Westmoreland Street (now a TGI Fridays); Mary Street and a short-term branch on South Great Georges Street during the refurbishment of the Grafton Street location. Branches also existed in Terminal 1 at Dublin Airport in some Waterstones stores, and in Arnotts department store as well as Belfast and Bangor.

A franchise operator ran multiple locations in suburban shopping centres including Nutgrove, The Square, Tallaght, Omni Park, Stillorgan Shopping Centre, the old Dundrum Shopping Centre as well as the chains first location on South Great Georges Street. Some of these locations had previous been run by the company directly. Franchised locations previously existed in Belfast and Portadown, closing in 1996.

==Bewley&#x27;s Hotels==

Bewley&#x27;s Hotels were a chain of hotels using the Bewley&#x27;s trademark both in Ireland and in the United Kingdom, owned by Slaney Foods and the Moran Hotel Group. 

This brand licensing agreement ended by mid-2015, following the sale of Moran Bewleys Hotels to Dalata Hotel Group.

The flagship hotel in the chain was in a restored 19th century Masonic school in Ballsbridge. Now known as the Clayton Hotel, Ballsbridge, some Masonic symbolism remains visible in the building&#x27;s ornamentation.

<doc id="382628" wikidata="Q6347361" url="?curid=382628" title="Kai Budde">
<text>Kai Budde (born 28 October 1979), is a professional player, who holds the record for Pro Tour victories, and for many years held the records for earnings and lifetime Pro Points. His performances earned him the nicknames &quot;The (German) Juggernaut&quot; and &quot;King of the Grand Prix&quot;. Kai left the game in late 2004 to focus on his studies, and his appearances in tournaments are less frequent than in earlier years. Budde is widely considered to be one of the all-time greatest Magic: The Gathering players.

He has won five individual Pro Tour titles (no other player has won more than three), and two Team Pro Tour titles (alongside fellow Germans Marco Blume and Dirk Baberowski). Budde also won the 1999 in Tokyo. His cash winnings in six years of premier Magic: The Gathering tournaments are well over $300,000. He has also been awarded a record four Player of the Year titles: 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2003.

Budde also won the 2001 Magic Invitational tournament in Cape Town. His prize was the rare opportunity to design an actual card; the result was Voidmage Prodigy. In 2007, Kai Budde was inducted into the Pro-Tour .

==Career==
===Early years===
Budde started playing Magic in 1994 when he learned about the game from fellow gamers. As a player from Cologne he quickly became acquainted with more experienced players from the city such as later Pro Tour winner Frank Adler. His rise to professional play coincided with that of Dirk Baberowski, another Magic player who had moved to Cologne. Being at a comparable level of playing, both worked together to qualify for the Pro Tour. Budde succeeded on his second attempt, thus qualifying for the . As he had not yet turned eighteen Kai chose to attend the Junior Division of the tournament, eventually finishing among the best 32. Afterwards, the Junior Pro Tour was discontinued and Budde was automatically qualified for the following Pro Tour in Mainz.

Kai finished 52nd in Mainz and for a while struggled to qualify for another Pro Tour but eventually managed to qualify for the . Fellow player and now friend Baberowski had finally managed to qualify for the Pro Tour, too. While Kai finished 19th Baberowski won the whole tournament. After a second place at Grand Prix Birmingham Budde added three Grand Prix titles within six months. The third one in Amsterdam even came by defeating Baberowski in the finals. With these finishes Budde had racked up enough Pro Points to be in contention for the Pro Player of the Year title in the final event of the . Having not made a Pro Tour Top 8 appearance yet the leader in the Pro Player of the Year race did not consider him to be a threat, though. When Budde advanced to the final of the in Tokyo he had already secured the Pro Player of the year race. He added the World Champion title by defeating Mark Le Pine in one of the quickest Pro Tour finals ever.

After adding an 11th-place finish at the next Pro Tour in London the rest of the turned out to be disappointing. He was not able to make it beyond the first round in any of the newly introduced Masters events nor did he finish better than Top 64 at any of the succeeding Pro Tours.

===Five Pro Tour titles in two years===
It took Kai until November 2000 to make another final eight appearance. A third place at Grand Prix Florence was followed by his second Pro Tour win. The 2000 Pro Tour Chicago title made him the third player to win more than one Pro Tour, the other two being Jon Finkel and Tommi Hovi. Winning Pro Tour Barcelona in the same season, Kai managed to surpass Finkel and Hovi to become the first player to win three Pro Tours. In the semi-final at Barcelona Budde had even asked if he could concede to his friend Patrick Mello to make him eligible for the next Masters, but the officials had refused. Finally a 44th-place finish at the World Championship in Toronto sufficed to make Kai the first double Pro Player of the Year.

The season started very well for Kai Budde with consecutive wins at Grand Prix London and Pro Tour New York. For the Team Pro Tour New York Kai had chosen his friends Dirk Baberowski and Marco Blume, despite being able to play with virtually anybody he would have liked. Dirk had retired from the game for some time, but Kai managed to convince him to come along for the Pro Tour. Team &quot;Phoenix Foundation&quot; as they called themselves went on to become the most successful team in the Pro Tour history. Pro Tour New York is also the origin of the saying &quot;Kai doesn&#x27;t lose on Sunday&quot;. Several Pro Players had answered something to that extent when asked who their favorite amongst the final four teams was. Less than two months later Kai added another Pro Tour title, this time in New Orleans. He is still the only player in the game to have won back to back Pro Tours. In between, Budde had also won the Invitational which gave him the chance to create a Magic card of his own design. The card eventually became .

Throughout the season a few more Grand Prix titles followed and eventually he managed another Top 8 appearance at Pro Tour Nice, this time losing in the quarter-final to Bram Snepvangers. Before the final event of the season, the World Championship in Sydney, Kai was already locked in to succeed himself as Pro Tour Player of the Year. Only a week after Nice, Budde won the German Nationals, securing another title he had not won before and thus making the national team. While he finished 44th individually at the World Championship, Kai led the German team with Felix Schneiders, a fellow player from his Cologne days, and Mark Ziegner to the team title.

Phoenix Foundation won the first Pro Tour of the , giving Kai an early lead in the Pro Player of the Year race. Also this set the three Phoenix Foundation members in the top three spots in lifetime Pro Tour wins until Jon Finkel overtook Blume with his victory in Kuala Lumpur five years later. After a few mediocre finishes through mid-season Kai won his seventh Pro Tour in Chicago, beating some of the most accomplished players such as Jon Finkel, William Jensen, and Nicolai Herzog along the way. Despite making no further Top 8 appearances in the season Kai was able to take his fourth Pro Player of the Year title with a comfortable lead.

===Decline, cancer diagnosis, and Player of the Year trophy===
In Phoenix Foundation managed to open with another top 4 appearance, but lost in the semi-final to the eventual winners. Kai managed to make a few more Top 8 appearance at Grand Prixs, among those a victory at the then biggest Magic tournament ever at Madrid, but his performances declined notably. He managed an undefeated first day at in the following season, but was quickly eliminated from the event afterwards. Budde has since been considered to be retired from Pro Play although he has shown up for a Pro Tour from time to time. Eventually he was inducted into the at the in New York City. Over the next years he played on the Pro Tour occasionally, but without much success. However, in Budde made his tenth Pro Tour top 8 in Amsterdam, and in he made his fifteenth Grand Prix top 8 in Paris. Since Budde has been a part of the team currently called &#x27;The Pantheon&#x27;, alongside players such as Jon Finkel, William Jensen, and Gabriel Nassif. In 2019, he made the Top 4 of the Mythic Championship III, a rebranded version of the Pro Tour, which was entirely played on &quot;&quot;. Then, in 2023, Budde made another Top 8 at Pro Tour &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in Barcelona. 

On June 29, 2024, it was announced that Budde was diagnosed with cancer years prior and that things had taken a turn for the worse. In honor of him, Wizards of the Coast named the 2024 season trophy &quot;The Kai Budde Player of the Year&quot;.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic it is being used as a vaccination centre since February 2021. The centre is scheduled to be operating 8am-8pm seven days a week. The capacity of the car park was a factor in choosing the building. The vaccination centre is the work of collaboration between general practitioners, practice nurses, medical students, Order of Malta Ambulance Corps, Order of Malta Ambulance Corps, Department of Health, Dublin City University and Dublin Airport.

<doc id="382633" wikidata="Q2444" url="?curid=382633" title="GloFish">
<text>The GloFish is a patented and trademarked brand of fluorescently colored genetically modified aquarium fish. They have been created from several different species of fish: zebrafish were the first GloFish available in pet stores, and recently the black tetra, tiger barb, rainbow shark, Siamese fighting fish, X-ray tetra, and most recently bronze corydoras have been added to the lineup. They are sold in many colors, trademarked as &quot;Starfire Red&quot;, &quot;Moonrise Pink&quot;, &quot;Sunburst Orange&quot;, &quot;Electric Green&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Blue&quot;, and &quot;Galactic Purple&quot;, although not all species are available in all colors. Although not originally developed for the ornamental fish trade, it is one of the first genetically modified animals to become publicly available. The rights to GloFish are owned by Spectrum Brands, Inc., which purchased GloFish from Yorktown Technologies, the original developer of GloFish, in May 2017.

== History ==

=== Early development ===

The original zebrafish (or zebra danio, &quot;Danio rerio&quot;) is a native of rivers in India and Bangladesh. It measures three centimeters long and has gold and dark blue stripes. In 1999, Dr. Zhiyuan Gong and his colleagues at the National University of Singapore were working with a gene that encodes the green fluorescent protein (GFP), originally extracted from a jellyfish, that naturally produced bright green fluorescence. They inserted the gene into a zebrafish embryo, allowing it to integrate into the zebrafish&#x27;s genome, which caused the fish to be brightly fluorescent under both natural white light and ultraviolet light. Their goal was to develop a fish that could detect pollution by selectively fluorescing in the presence of environmental toxins. The development of the constantly fluorescing fish was the first step in this process, and the National University of Singapore filed a patent application on this work. Shortly thereafter, his team developed a line of red fluorescent zebra fish by adding a gene from a sea coral, and orange-yellow fluorescent zebra fish, by adding a variant of the jellyfish gene. Later, a team of researchers at the National Taiwan University, headed by Professor Huai-Jen Tsai, succeeded in creating a medaka (rice fish) with a fluorescent green color, which, like the zebrafish, is a model organism used in biology.

The scientists from NUS and businessmen Alan Blake and Richard Crockett from Yorktown Technologies, L.P., a company in Austin, Texas, met and a deal was signed whereby Yorktown obtained the worldwide rights to market the fluorescent zebrafish, which Yorktown subsequently branded as &quot;GloFish&quot;. At around the same time, a separate deal was made between Taikong, the largest aquarium fish producer in Taiwan, and the Taiwanese researchers to market the green medaka in Taiwan under the name TK-1. In the spring of 2003, Taiwan became the first to authorize sales of a genetically modified organism as a pet. One hundred thousand fish were reportedly sold in less than a month at US$18.60 each. The fluorescent medaka are not GloFish, as they are not marketed by Yorktown Technologies, but instead by Taikong Corp under a different brand name.

=== Introduction to the United States market ===

GloFish were introduced to the United States market in late 2003 by Yorktown Technologies, after two years of research. The governmental environmental risk assessment was made by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has jurisdiction over all genetically modified (GM) animals, including fluorescent zebra fish, since they consider the inserted gene to be a drug. The FDA determined in December 2003:

Because tropical aquarium fish are not used for food purposes, they pose no threat to the food supply. There is no evidence that these genetically engineered zebra danio fish pose any more threat to the environment than their unmodified counterparts which have long been widely sold in the United States. In the absence of a clear risk to the public health, the FDA finds no reason to regulate these particular fish.
Marketing of the fish was met by protests from a non-governmental organization called the Center for Food Safety. They were concerned that approval of the GloFish based only on a Food and Drug Administration risk assessment would create a precedent of inadequate scrutiny of biotech animals in general. The group filed a lawsuit in US Federal District Court to block the sale of the GloFish. The lawsuit sought a court order stating that the sale of transgenic fish is subject to federal regulation beyond the FDA&#x27;s charter, and as such should not be sold without more extensive approvals. In the opinion of Joseph Mendelson, the Center for Food Safety&#x27;s legal director:

It&#x27;s clear this sets a precedent for genetically engineered animals. It opens the dams to a whole host of nonfood genetically engineered organisms. That&#x27;s unacceptable to us and runs counter to things the National Academy of Sciences and other scientific review boards have said, particularly when it comes to mobile GM organisms like fish and insects.
The Center for Food Safety&#x27;s suit was found to be without merit and dismissed on March 30, 2005.

=== Subsequent developments ===
In addition to the red zebrafish, Yorktown Technologies released green and orange-yellow versions of the zebrafish in mid-2006. In 2011, blue and purple zebrafish were released. These lines of fish incorporate genes from sea coral. In 2012, Yorktown Technologies introduced a green version of a GloFish derived from a different species of fish, the black tetra. This was followed by a green version of a tiger barb. In 2013, Yorktown Technologies introduced orange, pink, and purple Tetras, which made Tetras the first GloFish to be available in pink. This was followed in 2014 by the release of red and blue Tetras. The colors are trademarked as &quot;Starfire Red&quot;, &quot;Moonrise Pink&quot;, &quot;Sunburst Orange&quot;, &quot;Electric Green&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Blue&quot;, and &quot;Galactic Purple&quot;.

Other fish released include the GloFish shark, available in orange, green, and purple. Though these fish are not scientifically related to sharks, they are based on the albino rainbow shark. In February 2020, green GloFish bettas also known as Globettas were released, with three different variations. These variations include female, (young) male, and premium (adult) male. 

Despite the speculation of aquarium enthusiasts that the eggs of the fluorescent fish were pressure treated to make them infertile, it has been found some GloFish are indeed fertile and will reproduce in a captive environment. However, the GloFish Fluorescent Fish License states &quot;Intentional breeding and/or any sale, barter, or trade, of any offspring of GloFish fluorescent ornamental fish is strictly prohibited.&quot;.

Sale or possession of GloFish was made illegal in California in 2003 due to a regulation that restricts genetically modified fish. The regulation was implemented before the marketing of GloFish, largely due to concern about a fast-growing biotech salmon. The regulations were lifted in 2015 due to a growing body of evidence and the findings of the Food and Drug Administration and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. GloFish are now legal in California for importation and commercial sale.

The import, sale and possession of these fish is not permitted within the European Union. On November 9, 2006, however, the Netherlands’ Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM) found 1,400 fluorescent fish, which were sold in various aquarium shops.

In January 2009, the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration formalized their recommendations for genetically engineered animals. These non-binding recommendations describe the way in which FDA regulates all GM animals, including GloFish.

Research published in 2014 assessed the environmental safety associated with GloFish. One paper concluded that there is little risk of invasiveness into the environment. A second study concluded that there is no difference in risk between GloFish and wild-type danios.

== Public reception ==

The sentiments of aquarium retailers towards the GloFish have been used as an indicator of the public&#x27;s positive reaction to controversial agricultural and aesthetic biotechnologies. The practical reception of GloFish among fish retailers was found to be affected by multiple effects, including concerns over ethics, customer demand, and the high cost of stocking the fish. Some retailers opted not to stock the fish due to low trust in federal agencies to properly regulate the organisms.

== Vulnerability to predation ==
GloFish are more vulnerable to predation compared to the wild type, according to a study published in 2011. In experiments including habitat complexity, transgenic red fluorescent zebrafish were approximately twice as vulnerable as the wild type to predation by largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;) and eastern mosquitofish (&quot;Gambusia holbrooki&quot;), two native predators that potentially resist invasion by introduced fish.

== Evolutionary outcomes ==
According to Howard &quot;et al.&quot; 2015, wild-type males had a significant advantage over GloFish when it came to mating. According to the mating trials that were analyzed in the study, wild-type males sired twice as much as the genetically modified fish due to their more aggressive nature. However, in Owen &quot;et al.&quot; 2012 by the same group, female zebrafish &quot;preferred&quot; the GloFish rather than wild-type males.

<doc id="382639" wikidata="Q2563240" url="?curid=382639" title="Ballymun">
<text>Ballymun () is an outer suburb of Dublin, Ireland, at the northern edge of the city&#x27;s Northside.

Ballymun has several sub-districts, such as Sillogue, Coultry, Shangan and Poppintree, and is close to Dublin Airport. A metro stop on a city-to-airport line was planned but later shelved.

The population was 22,321 at the 2022 census.

==Geography==
Ballymun lies on the plains of southern Fingal (the historic area, rather than the modern county), sloping from northwest to southeast, from the catchment of the Santry River through that of the Wad River. The Santry rises in Harristown and Dubber, northwest of Ballymun, and crosses and drains the northern parts of the district. The Wad is the area&#x27;s main watershed, with branches most notably around Poppintree; it flows southeast, eventually reaching the estuary of the River Tolka at Clontarf

Ballymun neighbours Finglas, Glasnevin and Santry.

==History==
The name Ballymun most likely derives from , meaning the &#x27;town of the shrubland&#x27;, in reference to the once dense forest which covered the area. In the 1300s the land was controlled by the Baron Skryne, County Meath. Richard Stanyhurst was granted 180 acres at Ballymun in 1473 upon his marriage to Agneta of the Barons of Scyrne family. The Burnell family held the lands of Ballymun and Balgriffin until 1534, when John Burnell was executed for supporting the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The lands then passed to the Bathe family of Drumcondra. By 1615, Robert Barnwell of Dunbro held the lands of Ballymun, and by 1641 there were just 2 or 3 cottages and a single thatched house in the area. The population in 1659 was 10 people, 4 born in England, and 6 Irish. In 1662, just 3 residents paid a hearth tax in the area.

In the early 1700s, the tower house at Ballymun was constructed as a mill, which was subsequently taken over by an English educational society in 1744 to found a girls Charter School. It was later converted to a boys school, before closing in 1825. The building still stands and is today called Santry Lodge. Due to the dense woodland and sparse population, the area was generally regarded as dangerous in the early 1700s, with numerous highwaymen operating on the Drogheda Road. In 1829, the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; noted that Ballymun was a popular place for duels. The area known as Stormanstown is named after Lord Stormingston who was granted land in Ballymun by Henry VIII, with the original Stormanstown House which was built in the early 18th century. This tiled mansion was demolished in 1823, and another house of the same name replaced it. This house was used by the Albert Agricultural College as offices in the 20th century until it was demolished in 1970. Another house called Stormanstown on the corner of Glasnevin Avenue and Ballymun Road was the former residence of Brian O&#x27;Higgins. It too was demolished in the 1970s.

===Public housing for Dublin===
By the 1960s, Dublin&#x27;s housing stock was not only under pressure from a rising population but was also poorly maintained. House collapses in Bolton Street and Fenian Street in 1963 led to the death of four people, forcing Dublin Corporation to adopt &#x27;emergency measures&#x27; to deal with the crisis. In 1964, in a response to this housing crisis in inner city areas of the capital, plans were made to build high-rise flat complexes; construction started in 1966 and were completed by the following year. The seven 15-storey towers were named after Irish Republican revolutionaries, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. The flat complexes consisted of five 8-storey &quot;districts&quot; (Balbutcher, Balcurris, Coultry, Shangan and Sillogue) and three 4-storey &quot;districts,&quot; two of which were part of Shangan and Sillogue, the third being located in Sandyhill. The Poppintree area of Ballymun was constructed in the late 1970s.

=== Original development ===
At the time of its construction, Ballymun was a sought-after location and prospective tenants had to pass an interview to get housing there. There were three types of apartment building: seven &quot;fifteen-storey&quot; towers (which actually had 16 storeys plus plant rooms above), nineteen eight-storey blocks and ten four-storey blocks. The flats were built in the 1960s on contracts from the National Building Agency under the authority of Neil Blaney, the Minister for Local Government.

Later commentators described the development of the flats and the district as problematic, with the environmental journalist Frank McDonald, in his book &quot;The Construction of Dublin&quot;, calling it the Irish state&#x27;s &quot;worst planning disaster&quot;, but the issues were not with the apartment buildings as such but the failure to integrate construction of accommodation with provision of services, problematic maintenance, notably of the lifts, the lack of social mix, and the abrupt move of tightly knit inner-city community families to an isolated area on the very edge of the city. Dublin&#x27;s City Architect, Ali Grehan, after working as a lead architect and designer with the Ballymun regeneration project, commented that the concept of the area, developed from green fields, and its new (for Ireland) types of accommodation were a &quot;really great idea&quot; but that the project was &quot;doomed to fall into decline&quot; due to poor planning and central government policies. She especially highlighted the scale of the development, its purely public housing nature, and its location — a &quot;constructed around a roundabout ... a dead end&quot;. She also noted that the concept envisaged the shopping centre being available from the start, but delayed for years, and the issues with lift and centralised heating system (also a new idea for Ireland) maintenance.

The corporation had more gradual plans for development in multiple locations, and according to geographer Joe Brady of University College Dublin, Dublin Corporation were sceptical about the Ballymun scheme but given the weakness of Irish local government and especially its funding, had little choice but to work with the proposal from national government:
The first tenants moved in between August 1966 and December 1966. By February 1969, when the National Building Agency&#x27;s contract for Ballymun ceased and control of Ballymun was handed to Dublin Corporation, there was a total of 3,021 dwellings, fully comprising publicly-owned social housing.

===Social challenges, community activity===
Some social problems occurred in the early years, as families which had grown up in dense city terraces close to Dublin&#x27;s retail core, found themselves at the edge of the city, with few amenities beyond a small and expensive travelling &quot;van shop&quot;. Over time, Ballymun became notorious for a number of social problems, such as drug abuse and unemployment, and was impacted by negative media coverage of the area. At the same time, a wide range of local community organisations emerged, for particular areas and towers, and for purposes such as small enterprise support, anti-drugs campaigning and community project support.

The current Ballymun district is not substantially in the townland historically called &quot;Ballymun&quot; — instead, it occupies several nearby townlands, the most significant of which is Stormanstown. Due to what were seen to be undesirable associations, some say that the area has shrunk since the completion of the tower blocks. For instance, in the early days of Dublin City University (DCU), then called NIHE, Dublin, this institution was sometimes referred to as being in Ballymun (part of the &quot;Ballymun Project&quot;), or sometimes in Whitehall, while today it is referred to and has a postal address in Glasnevin, even though it has not changed location. Indeed, much of the present day central Ballymun lies on lands once in the northern reaches of the Albert Agricultural College estate, the forerunner of the present-day DCU. Streets have also been renamed — for example, Ballymun Avenue (which was previously Collins Avenue Extension) was renamed Glasnevin Avenue after a local plebiscite in the 1970s.

The city architect commented in 2015 that the &quot;killer blow&quot; for Ballymun was the offering of a tenant-purchase scheme in 1985, which gave good terms for local authority tenants to buy out their accommodation, but only if they had a house, not a flat, which led to many committed community members moving from Ballymun to be able to avail of the offer. This led to a &quot;cycle of decline&quot; and ultimately the need for a regeneration.

===Regeneration of Ballymun===

The government and Dublin City Council agreed an ambitious regeneration plan for Ballymun, with a budget exceeding €440 million. The creation of Ballymun Regeneration Limited as a limited company controlled by Dublin City Council initiated the main part of the project, beginning of the demolition of the Ballymun flats, and planned to conclude with the emergence of a &quot;new town&quot; of Ballymun. , six of the seven towers (Pearse, Ceannt, McDermott, McDonagh, Connolly, and Clarke) as well as three eight-storey blocks and seven four-storey blocks had been demolished by DSM, with the residents generally rehoused in new &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; housing in Ballymun. The new housing is a mixture of public, private, voluntary and co-operative housing. The residential aspects of the &quot;new Ballymun&quot; were largely completed by 2013. Several films and documentary TV programmes were produced during the regeneration period.

====Positive aspects====
The regeneration delivered the promised new housing, and many other amenities, including reworked park areas, a major City Council office facility, Health Service facilities, a public leisure centre, the Axis arts centre, student accommodation, a new hotel, and some renewed retail facilities.

====Criticisms====
During the planning and delivery process, the regeneration project attracted well-publicised questions about accountability and democratic participation. During it, most of the large number of community organisations closed. The regeneration saw the loss of many shops, including the emptying of the only shopping centre, Ballymun Town Centre. This meant the 18,000 residents had to travel to other districts for major grocery, and virtually all non-grocery, shopping. The plan for a replacement centre failed, and as of 2021, there is no central shopping facility. The shopping centre was eventually demolished in 2020.

====Arts during the regeneration====
During the regeneration and organisation, Breaking Ground, was set up as a &quot;percent for art&quot; scheme, and commissioned a wide range of projects, including prominent sculptures, and two headline projects, Hotel Ballymun and amaptocare.

In 2007, a floor of the by-then vacant Thomas Clarke Tower was temporarily transformed into a hotel as part of an art project; the project ran for a month and was heavily booked, with a waiting list.

As part of the New Ballymun, a major tree-planting project called amaptocare has been run, with more than 600 people sponsoring the planting of around 635 trees, and providing inscription texts which are engraved on plaques near the trees. Sponsors were informed that the all trees would be identified on a glass panel at Ballymun&#x27;s central plaza; the plaza was completed by 2013, but the panel has, as of 2019, not yet been made.

The most-publicised sculpture was , which portrayed a young local woman on a horse, at 1.5 times life size. The model, Toni Marie Shields, was selected by public auditions, and 3D-imaged in London. Designed to be placed centrally in the district, it was temporarily erected in front of the area&#x27;s only secondary school, where, as of 2021, it remains.

===After regeneration===
====Local area plan====
In 2017, with the formal end of the regeneration, and the dissolution of Ballymun Regeneration Limited, 2,820 apartments had been replaced by just under 2,000 units of social housing, and 1,350 units of privately owned housing, mostly rented out. The area had moved from 80% of residents living in social housing to just under 60%, with one in eight in private rental, and 28% owner-occupied. In July 2017, the City Council approved a Local Area Plan for the area, to govern future development. This plan provided for around 2,000 housing units, of which a significant percentage would be for sale, but with developers to be required to sell 10% to the council or an Approved Housing Body for social housing. The plan included guidance for 31 distinct sites, totalling 34 hectares, and including as a priority redevelopment of the almost-derelict central shopping centre.

====2018 Metro Hotel Dublin====
A multistorey hotel fire occurred in the building containing the Metro Hotel Dublin and two floors of apartments, on 21 March 2018. The fire broke out at approximately 8.00 pm and affected the top seven floors of the building. At least 12 units of Dublin Fire Brigade attended the building, and confirmed that the hotel was successfully evacuated. Dublin Fire Brigade reported soon after the fire was extinguished that there were no reports of any casualties or people unaccounted for. This included approximately 150 guests who were staying in the hotel. The fire broke out in a private residence on the 13th floor, above rooms for hotel guests.

The 15-storey hotel and apartment building was built as part of the Ballymun renewal, developed in 2006 by Pierce Contracting and a group of investors who included businessman Paddy Kelly. The hotel was designed by Shay Cleary Architects for Pierse Contracting and was originally scheduled to open on 9 June 2006, and was operated by the Days Inn Hotel group.

In 2007 a charter plane with 118 passengers and crew narrowly avoided crashing into the hotel after its pilot mistook the red lighting on the hotel&#x27;s roof combined with its white internal light for the approach lights of a Dublin Airport runway. The incident occurred at 11.34 pm on the night of 16 August 2007, when the McDonnell Douglas jet was carrying 112 passengers and six crew on a charter flight from Lisbon to Dublin.

In April 2014, the 88-bedroom Metro Hotel was put on the market in the region of €2.5 million. Along with the hotel, the sellers sought €3 million for the 30 two-bed apartments on the upper floors of the property. In July 2016, planning permission was refused for the retention of masts and antennae on the hotel.

==Transport==
Ballymun is served by a number of Dublin Bus routes to the city centre including the numbers 19, E1 and the E2 while the Go-Ahead Ireland route 220 runs between Mulhuddart and DCU Helix and the 220T runs from Finglas Garda station to Whitehall.

The area was also envisaged to have an underground stop on the planned Metro North (Dublin city centre to Swords) line of the Dublin Metro. Plans for that have been revived with the Irish Government&#x27;s &#x27;Project Ireland 2040&#x27; scheme and the revised MetroLink concept. Journey time from Ballymun to the airport is estimated be around ten minutes by car, and to Dublin city centre 25–40 minutes.

==Amenities==
===Education===
There are a number of schools in each sub-district, including a (Irish-speaking) primary school in the Coultry district and another on Main Street, opposite to Trinity Comprehensive which is the only secondary school in Ballymun; this was formerly known as Ballymun Comprehensive and split between boys on the North side and girls on the South side before a major reconfiguration in 2005.

===Retail===
From the earliest years of the area&#x27;s development, due to delays in building retail units, it was served by &quot;van shops&quot;. Often criticised for limited selection and high prices, they remained into the 2000s.

The area&#x27;s only shopping centre, Ballymun Town Centre, was built as a central point for the whole community, and was the main source for shopping for over 40 years. It was owned by the City Council, and rented units on commercial terms, with, as of 1991, a rent roll of half a million euro, and service charge income of 300,000 euro. By that time, there were urgent calls from traders and locals for serious refurbishment, but it proved hard to progress these issues due to questions about who should fund any work. Redevelopment of the centre was a major element of the Ballymun Masterplan from 1997, and was to be private sector-led. 53% of the centre and surrounding site was sold to major developer Treasury Holdings for 6 million pounds in 2000, with the local authority retaining the rest. As of 2000, the centre was to be redeveloped by 2005, but there were delays.

In 2009, when Ireland was recovering from financial crisis, the developer secured permission for a complex to be called Springcross, involving a planned investment of 800 million euro to provide more than 70 shopping and office units, cinema and other entertainment facilities, dining places, a new public library branch, and a creche. Construction was planned to begin by 2010, but by then the site had been taken over by State agency NAMA, and the project was unable to proceed. Various units had closed during and after the disruption of the regeneration, and the anchor tenant, Tesco Ireland, handed back its unit early in 2014. In May 2014, NAMA and Treasury&#x27;s receivers agreed to sell the 53% share back to the council, and in 2016 the Council used compulsory purchase powers to secure clear title to the whole complex, with the final lessees leaving mid-2018, and the centre being boarded up. In 2019, a 1.9 million euro contract to clear the site was awarded, and main demolition started mid-2019. The council announced plans to sell the site to a new developer, who would be permitted to construct a combined retail and residential building. As of 2025, the site remained vacant.

Aside from the shopping centre, there was a Supervalu supermarket, and in 2020, a Lidl store also opened; the Supervalu closed in late 2023. The area is otherwise served by shopping centres some kilometres way in Finglas and Santry. As of 2004, 78% of locals shopped at least once a week in a van shop, 66% in Ballymun Shopping Centre, 44% in Omni Centre in Santry and 19% in Finglas.

A small AIB branch, which used to be a Bank of Ireland branch before closure in 1984, was demolished in 2017 and replaced by a new AIB branch near the Civic Centre. The Republic of Ireland&#x27;s only IKEA store is located between Ballymun and Finglas, on St. Margaret&#x27;s Road, and is named for the area; the shop has sometimes been the highest-earning IKEA store in the world. A first Irish store for Decathlon, branded Decathlon Baile Munna / Ballymun, was opened adjacent to the IKEA in 2020.

===Civic centre===

On the site of a former large underpass and roundabout, a brand new civic complex was built, including The Axis arts centre (opened in 2001), with the local health centre (completed and opened in 2003) and Garda station also moved here, although their defunct buildings remained across the road. City Council offices are also here, although the offices handling some services, such as driver licensing and motor taxation, closed as part of broader changes in such service delivery.

===Other amenities===
A number of green spaces, parks and playgrounds have been built around the district, and some were remodelled during the regeneration, notably Poppintree Park.

Two hotels, Travelodge and Metro are located in this area, as well as a city-owned gym and leisure centre (the old Ballymun swimming pool was demolished in 2016 after being defunct for a number of years).

===Religion===
There is a church in the old village centre, which was built in 1847 and replaced a penal chapel. Ballymun is a parish in the Fingal South West deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin.

==Sport==
There are a number of local sports groups, including:
* In soccer:Ballymun United Football Club.
* For the GAA, Ballymun Kickhams Gaelic Football Club and Setanta Hurling Club

==Governance and politics==
Ballymun is in the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council, and for local elections it is part of the Finglas-Ballymun local electoral area. It is in the council&#x27;s Dublin North West area, and hosts one of two area offices for that division of the city, the other being in Finglas.

==Ballymun in the media==
For decades, Ballymun&#x27;s reputation was damaged by a high level of negative publicity in the media, usually focusing on crime and drugs, whilst ignoring positive news.

===Television and film===
====About Ballymun====
The 1992 film Into the West was set, and filmed, in Ballymun.

Other fictional works that were set in the area were the 1994 drama mini-series Family and the 1982 short film One Day Time .

====Documentary====
Several documentaries of the area have been made throughout the years, notably during the regeneration. A film of the leisure centre by filmmakers Joe Lawlor and Christine Molloy, &quot;LEISURE CENTRE&quot;, was made in 2007 and starred hundreds of Ballymun residents. A documentary film entitled &quot;Ballymun Lullaby&quot; was released in February 2011 and includes scenes detailing the regeneration of Ballymun as well as its impact on the culture of its populace. In 2018 &quot;The 4th Act&quot; looked back at the whole regeneration, with contextual material about the area&#x27;s history; it had significant appearances from several community activists, and City Council and BRL officials, and the artists, Seamus Nolan and Jochen Gerz, who led the biggest Ballymun arts projects, Hotel Ballymun and amaptocare respectively. It also highlighted the compilation and even printing of the area&#x27;s oral history project, which sponsor Ballymun Regeneration then refused to publish and distribute.

====Using Ballymun as urban setting====
&quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, a 2002 British-Irish film written and directed by Paul Greengrass and based around the 1972 &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; incident in Northern Ireland. The film was mostly shot in Ballymun, with some location scenes shot in Northern Ireland.

===Books===
In September 2006, Gill &amp; Macmillan published &quot;The Mun&quot;, by Lynn Connolly. This is a memoir covering the history of Ballymun from its inception to the final regeneration of the town. &quot;The Mun&quot; was Connolly&#x27;s account of another side of Ballymun, of which she had fond memories, not press stories about drug dealing and gangsters but accounts of a community that thrived in spite of the squalor.

In April 2009, Irish publisher Gill &amp; Macmillan published Ballymun resident Rachael Keogh&#x27;s account of her life as a heroin addict, &quot;Dying to Survive&quot;. Rachael started taking drugs aged 12 and for the next 15 years was hooked on a variety of substances. In 2006, after repeated attempts to get help, Rachael went to the media to publicise her plight.

In 2010 New Island Books published &quot;The Ballymun Trilogy&quot; by the Dublin playwright, Dermot Bolger: three plays that chart forty years of life in Ballymun and which were all premiered in Axis in Ballymun before being staged in Britain, America, Poland and elsewhere.

<text>Greystones () is a coastal town and seaside resort in County Wicklow, Ireland. It lies on Ireland&#x27;s east coast, south of Bray and south of Dublin city centre and has a population of 22,009, according to the 2022 census. The town is bordered by the Irish Sea to the east, Bray Head to the north and the Wicklow Mountains to the west. It is the second largest town in County Wicklow (after Bray).

The town was named after a half-mile or one-kilometre stretch of grey stones between two beaches on the seafront. The harbour area and Greystones railway station are at the northern and southern ends respectively. The North Beach, which begins at the harbour, is a stony beach, and some of its length is overlooked by the southern cliffs of Bray Head, which are subject to erosion. The South Beach is a broad sandy beach about one kilometre long. It is a Blue Flag beach and receives many visitors and tourists, mainly in the summer.

In 2008, Greystones was named as the world&#x27;s &quot;most liveable community&quot; at the LivCom Awards in China. The community received the same award again in 2021.

== History ==
Greystones is located south of the site of an ancient castle of the Barony of Rathdown. There was a hamlet which, like Rathdown Castle, was known as Rathdown, and which appeared on a 1712 map. This site occupied an area now known as the Grove, north of Greystones harbour, but only the ruins of a chapel, St. Crispin&#x27;s Cell, survive. Greystones is a much more recent settlement and is first mentioned in , a 1795 publication. Here it is described as a &quot;noted fishing place four miles beyond Bray.&quot;
In the early 19th century, there were some families scattered around the harbour, Blacklion, Windgates, Killincarrig and Rathdown. Delgany was a more substantial and longer-established village. However, Greystones was put on the map with the coming of the railway in 1855, a difficult undertaking which was performed in consultation with the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The railway station was built on the line dividing the properties of two landowners: the &quot;La Touche&quot; family of Bellevue House (now in ruins, near Delgany), and the &quot;Hawkins-Whitshed&quot; family of Killincarrig House (which is now Greystones Golf Club). It provided links with Bray and Dublin and left room for development on the adjoining estates.

Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed (better known as Lizzie Le Blond) owned the &quot;Hawkins-Whitshed&quot; estate from 1871 and she developed Ireland&#x27;s first planned housing estate, an area currently known as the Burnaby. She was a mountaineer and explorer, a photographer, an author of mountaineering books, fiction, travel writing and a filmmaker. She donated, for a nominal rent, the site upon which the library in Greystones is built. Her first marriage to Frederick Gustavus Burnaby was short-lived and he is only known to have visited Wicklow once; However the area is still given his surname. An adjoining estate to that of Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed was owned by the La Touche Family. It was during the time William Robert La Touche owned the estate that Greystones developed rapidly. To the north of the station, Church Road, Victoria Road and Trafalgar Road were laid out, and many houses were built. In the early 20th century, the Burnabys began to expand the town on their side of the station, and the roads and houses of the Burnaby were developed and the population grew. The names of these two families are reflected on the names of several roads and housing estates in the area.

Between 1885 and 1897, the people of Greystones campaigned for a harbour to aid the fishing industry and imports such as coal. The original pier, dock, sea wall and boat slip remained pre-2009 but had endured substantial damage. In the early 20th century, the town felt the effects of coastal erosion (which is still a major problem); the loss of fields and most of the houses on the &quot;North Beach Road&quot;, and the costly inland relocation of the railway have all resulted. In 1968, the old Kish lighthouse foundation was added to the end of the pier.

At the end of World War II, cars and petrol became widely available, allowing Greystones to gradually expand, filling in space between itself and outlying areas such as Blacklion, Killincarrig and Delgany. However, the popularity of the railway declined; its very existence being in jeopardy during the 1980s, as government cutbacks reduced the service to just a few trains per day. The 1990s brought a revival with the arrival of the electrified DART from Bray, and a much more frequent schedule.

== Population and development ==

Greystones has experienced a large increase in its population since the 1970s with the construction of mainly large housing estates. The first of these periods lasted for around a decade seeing the development of estates like Hillside, Applewood Heights, Redford Park and other smaller ones like Burnaby Park. The second boom in construction came during the Celtic Tiger period of the early 2000s which saw developments such as Charlesland (the biggest) just south of the town, which includes over 1,000 units. Following the 2008 financial crisis little development took place, evident in the difference between the 2011 census and the 2016 census; an increase of only 1,000.

As of 2018, Greystones was experiencing a housing boom. A number of large-scale developments were taking place, mainly on the western fringes of the town, in the harbour area and around Charlesland. The main schemes included Seagreen and Waverly in Blacklion, Glenheron and Archer&#x27;s Wood beside Charlesland and Marina village at the harbour. As of 2021, there were also multiple other similar schemes approved or pending approval. These new developments resulted in a population increase of almost 4000 between 2016 and 2022.

As of the 2022 census, the population of Greystones–Delgany stood at 22,009, making it the second largest town in the county after Bray. In 2016, the Greystones Municipal District Population stood at 26,323.

Wicklow County Council and Greystones Municipal District Council plan for at least 24,000 by 2028 in the town itself.

Along with the housing developments, road networks and facilities have been &quot;improved&quot; to cater for the growth. The road between Greystones and Bray has been slightly widened and realigned. A dual carriageway link road (R774) connecting Greystones to the N11 has been completed to the south of the town. Construction of a full interchange with the N11 has also been completed. Chapel Road has been connected with Blacklion Manor Road forming a new section of wide higher capacity road from the junction at Lidl to the junction with the top of Applewood Heights, creating a complete bottleneck at Delgany village. Estates like Seagreen access from this road.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Greystones is accessible from the N11 Dublin–Wexford road; via an interchange (Junction 11 on the N11) near Charlesland connects with the town via a dual carriageway. This quickly changes into the M11. This then joins onto the M50 (Dublin&#x27;s orbital motorway) about 10 km north. There is an interchange in Bray (J7) that has a link road to Greystones from the north

=== Rail ===
Greystones railway station, which opened on 30 October 1855, is the southern terminus of the DART railway line, a service which connects thirty-one stations along Dublin&#x27;s east coast. Iarnród Éireann diesel Commuter and InterCity trains also serve Greystones, linking the town with Wicklow, Arklow, Gorey, Wexford, and Rosslare Europort to the south, and Dublin&#x27;s Connolly Station to the north.

=== Bus ===
Greystones is served by the L1, L2, L3, X1 and X2 bus routes whilst route 702 Aircoach service starting at Charlesland links the area with Dublin Airport.

=== Walking ===
Bray and Greystones are linked by a Cliff Walk, which follows the route of the railway line around Bray Head. The walk is 6 km long and takes approximately two hours.

==Administration==
Greystones is part of the Dáil constituency of Wicklow and the European Parliament constituency of South. , three of Wicklow&#x27;s five TDs are based in Greystones: Stephen Donnelly (FF), Simon Harris (FG) and Jennifer Whitmore (SD).

In local government, the Greystones local electoral area (LEA) elects six councillors to Wicklow County Council who sit as Greystones Municipal District. This LEA also includes the neighbouring villages of Delgany, Kilcoole and Newcastle Lower.

In 1984, Greystones was granted town commissioners. This became a town council in 2002. All town councils in Ireland were abolished in 2014.

== Development ==

=== Marina ===
A €300 million redevelopment scheme for the harbour was proposed by the Sispar consortium (Sispar is a joint venture consortium of Sisk and Michael Cotter&#x27;s Park Developments) in a public-private partnership with Wicklow County Council. This development was a topical issue in the town, with objections revolving around the privatisation of public beachfront land without a broad public agreement. The development includes a new harbour, 341 apartments, a 230 berth marina, a new public plaza and facilities for local sporting clubs.

On the granting of planning permission, 6,210 submissions were received by An Bord Pleanála on initial plans, of which more than 6,200 were objections. Many of the objections came from outside County Wicklow, according to a spokesman for Wicklow County Council. Many objected to specifics of the plan while approving the general idea. An oral hearing was held and the board requested the developers to make certain changes which resulted in the plans being scaled down by approximately 10%. Some 3,700 objections were made on these updated plans. On 9 August 2007, the board approved the final plans, while imposing 13 conditions on construction works, including the retention of public access to the Cliff Walk during the development period, strict guidelines in relation to dust suppression, the re-use of demolition materials, and limitations on the hours of operation and noise levels. The board also overruled an earlier inspector&#x27;s report, instead permitting an old unlicensed landfill to remain beside the new apartments.

In February 2010, it was announced that development of the marina would be paused indefinitely due to conditions in the Irish property market.

After the development plans stalled, the loans attached to the development were transferred to NAMA. Sispar insisted that it needed funding from NAMA to finish the project. In September 2012 it was reported that NAMA had written off €50m owed for the troubled development of Greystones Harbour. It appeared that it was not the Sispar consortium but Sisk alone that controlled the loans.

Almost all of the new harbour facilities are now in use and available to the public, while the construction of apartments is ongoing.

== Sports ==

The town is home the association football club Greystones United, which is based at Woodlands near the south beach.

<text>The Tom Clarke Bridge (), formerly and commonly known as the East-Link Toll Bridge, is a toll bridge in Dublin, Ireland, on the River Liffey, owned and operated by Dublin City Council. The bascule-type lifting bridge, which links North Wall to Ringsend, is the last bridge on the Liffey, which opens out into Dublin Port and then Dublin Bay just beyond. The bridge forms part of the R131 regional road.

==Background and use==
The bridge is the most easterly crossing on the Liffey and replaced a number of ferries that carried cross-river traffic at the point as early as 1655. The bridge was built by NTR, and opened to vehicular traffic in October 1984. The bridge reverted to city council control on 31 December 2015.

The city centre is west of the bridge, which links routes on the eastern side of Dublin city. The Dublin Port Tunnel terminates north of the East-Link along East Wall Road, in the Docklands on the north bank of the Liffey. Most of Dublin&#x27;s docklands are east of the bridge, but it is raised on average three times per day to allow river traffic to pass.

As of 2016, between 14,000 and 17,000 vehicles per day cross the bridge. As of 2016, lorries and cars pay, either in cash or using electronic tokens, and cycles and motorbikes cross for free. The tolling area and administrative offices are on the south (Ringsend) side of the bridge.

==Name==

Originally adopting a functional name, the East-Link bridge was officially renamed as Thomas Clarke Bridge by President Michael D. Higgins to commemorate the Irish republican Thomas Clarke.

The renaming ceremony was held on 3 May 2016, marking the centenary of the day Clarke was shot in Kilmainham Gaol for his involvement in the 1916 Easter Rising.

==Incidents==
In October 1985, a ship named the MV Miranda Guinness, with a cargo of Guinness beer bound for Liverpool, collided with the bridge.

== Geography ==
The green area that comprises the municipality of Midden-Delfland was named Midden-Delfland before 2004, and it referred to the green area surrounded by cities (such as The Hague and Rotterdam) and the horticulture area of Westland. The supporters of a continuous green area were lucky that the municipality of Midden-Delfland became a reality: the cities of Delft, Vlaardingen and Schiedam wanted to build new houses here, and the Westland gardeners also wanted to expand. Now, Midden-Delfland is designated as a recreation area for people from the surrounding cities.

== Notable people ==

<text>Mildew is a form of fungus. It is distinguished from its closely related counterpart, mold, largely by its colour: molds appear in shades of black, blue, red, and green, whereas mildew is white. It appears as a thin, superficial growth consisting of minute hyphae (fungal filaments) produced especially on living plants or organic matter such as wood, paper or leather. Both mold and mildew produce distinct offensive odours, and both have been identified as the cause of certain human ailments.

In horticulture, mildews are species of fungus in the order Erysiphales, or fungus-like organisms in the family &quot;Peronosporaceae&quot;. It is also used more generally to mean mold growth. In Old English, mildew meant honeydew (a substance secreted by aphids on leaves, formerly thought to distill from the air like dew), and later came to mean mold or fungus.

== Household varieties ==
The term mildew is often used generically to refer to mold growth, usually with a flat growth habit. Molds can thrive on many organic materials, including clothing, leather, paper, and the ceilings, walls and floors of homes or offices with poor moisture control. Mildew can be cleaned using specialized mildew remover, or substances such as bleach (though they may discolour the surface).

There are many species of mold. The black mold which grows in attics, on window sills, and other places where moisture levels are moderate often is &quot;Cladosporium&quot;. Colour alone is not always a reliable indicator of the species of mold. Proper identification requires a microbiologist or mycologist. Mold growth found on cellulose-based substrates or materials where moisture levels are high (90 per cent or greater) is often &quot;Stachybotrys chartarum.&quot; &quot;Black mold,&quot; also known as &quot;toxic black mold&quot;, properly refers to &quot;S. chartarum&quot;. This species is commonly found indoors on wet materials containing cellulose, such as wallboard (drywall), jute, wicker, straw baskets, and other paper materials. &quot;S. chartarum&quot; does not, however, grow on plastic, vinyl, concrete, glass, ceramic tile, or metals. A variety of other mold species, such as &quot;Penicillium&quot; or &quot;Aspergillus&quot;, may appear to grow on non-cellulosic surfaces but are actually growing on the biofilm that adheres to these surfaces. Glass, plastic, and concrete provide no food for organic growth and as such cannot support mold or mildew growth alone without biofilm present. In places with stagnant air, such as basements, molds can produce a strong musty odour.

The pink &quot;mildew&quot; often found on plastic shower curtains and bathroom tile is a red yeast, &quot;Rhodotorula&quot;.

== Environmental conditions ==
Mildew requires certain factors to develop. Without any one of these, it cannot reproduce and grow. The requirements are a food source (any organic material), sufficient ambient moisture (a relative humidity of 62–93%), and reasonable warmth () is optimal. Still, some growth can occur anywhere between freezing and . Slightly acidic conditions are also preferred. At warmer temperatures, air can hold a greater volume of water; as air temperatures drop, so does the ability of air to hold moisture, which then tends to condense on cool surfaces. This can work to bring moisture onto surfaces where mildew is then likely to grow (such as an exterior wall).

Preventing the growth of mildew therefore requires a balance between moisture and temperature. This can be achieved by minimizing the moisture available in the air.

Air temperatures at or below will inhibit growth, but only if the relative humidity is low enough to prevent water condensation (i.e., the dew point is not reached).

With warmer temperatures, the water holding capacity of the air increases. This means that if the amount of water vapour in the warming air remains the same, the air will become drier (i.e. it has a lower relative humidity). This again inhibits fungal growth. However, warm, growth-favoring temperatures coupled with high relative humidity will support mildew growth.

Air conditioners are one effective tool for removing moisture and heat from otherwise humid warm air. The coils of an air conditioner cause moisture in the air to condense on them, eventually losing this excess moisture through a drain and placing it back into the environment. They can also inhibit mildew growth by lowering indoor temperatures. For them to be effective, air conditioners must recirculate the existing indoor air and not be exposed to warm, humid outside air. Some energy efficient air conditioners may cool a room so quickly that they do not have an opportunity to also effectively collect and drain significant ambient water vapour.

<text>Balibo is a town in East Timor situated approximately from the Indonesian border. It is located in the sub-district of Balibo, Bobonaro District.

It was estimated by Human Rights Watch that 70 percent of the town was destroyed during the militia violence that preceded the vote on East Timorese independence.

Balibo achieved notoriety as the site of the killing of five Australian-based journalists, now known as the Balibo Five, by Indonesian forces in the 1970s. Australian reporters from Channels 7, 9 and ABC were covering an incursion by Indonesia into what was then Portuguese Timor. The reporters from Channels 7 and 9 were killed on 16 October 1975 by Indonesian Special Forces, to prevent information about the invasion from being released. In December 1975, another Australian reporter, Roger East, who was investigating the deaths of the other five, was reportedly seized by Indonesian soldiers, and then shot by a firing squad.

The town is home to a 400-year-old fort, which was the scene of several battles during the Indonesian invasion in 1975. The Balibo Five were also filming from the fort when Indonesian forces landed in Balibo on the day they died. The fort has been converted into a hotel as of 2016 by the Balibo House Trust, with support from the Rotary Club of Port Melbourne.

The Balibo Declaration, which criticised the declaration of independence, and was later used by the Indonesian government as partial justification for its invasion, was said to have been signed here, but was actually drafted by Indonesian intelligence and signed in Bali, Indonesia.

During the International Force East Timor (INTERFET) mission after the Indonesian withdrawal, the fort was used as a base for approximately one thousand United Nations (UN) troops, as part of Operation Lavarack. Kylie Minogue performed an unplugged concert in Balibo to entertain UN troops in 1999, as part of the Tour of Duty series of concerts.

In 2003, the government of Victoria, Australia purchased the house where the five journalists had stayed, as it had fallen into disrepair, and renovated it to serve as a creche, library, and vocational training centre. International aid organisations have also been involved in other reconstruction work in the town, such as the rebuilding of a dormitory for schoolchildren from remote communities that had been razed during the militia attacks.

<doc id="382665" wikidata="Q295257" url="?curid=382665" title="Michel Piccoli">
<text>Jacques Daniel Michel Piccoli (27 December 1925 – 12 May 2020) was a French actor, producer and film director with a career spanning 70 years. He was lauded as one of the greatest French character actors of his generation who played a wide variety of roles and worked with many acclaimed directors, being awarded with a Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival and a Silver Bear for Best Actor at the Berlin Film Festival.

==Life and career==
Piccoli was born in Paris to a musical family; his French mother was a pianist and his Swiss father was a violinist from the canton of Ticino.

He appeared in many different roles, from seducer to cop to gangster to Pope, in more than 170 movies. He appeared in six films directed by Luis Buñuel including &quot;Belle de Jour&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; (1972), but also appeared as Brigitte Bardot&#x27;s husband in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Contempt&quot; (1963) and as the main antagonist in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Topaz&quot; (1969). He also appeared in many films by Claude Sautet, sometimes co-starring in them with Romy Schneider, and became a frequent collaborator of director Marco Ferreri, with whom he worked on several films, including &quot;Dillinger Is Dead&quot; and &quot;La Grande Bouffe&quot;. In 1973 he starred in Luis García Berlanga&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (Life Size), a controversial film that suffered censorship during the Franco era and was not released in Spain until 1978.

In the 1990s, Piccoli also worked as a director on three films. One of his last leading roles was his portrayal of a depressed, newly elected pope in Nanni Moretti&#x27;s &quot;We Have a Pope&quot; (2011), for which he was awarded with the David di Donatello Award for Best Actor.

=== Political views ===
Piccoli was part of the Saint-Germain-des-Prés circle in the 1950s, which included Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. He was a member of the French Communist Party in this era. A lifelong left-winger, he objected to repression in the Soviet bloc, and supported the Solidarity trade union in Poland.

=== Personal life and death ===
Piccoli married three times and divorced twice. His first marriage was to Éléonore Hirt. They had one daughter together. He was then married for eleven years to singer Juliette Gréco. His final marriage was to Ludivine Clerc, with whom he adopted a daughter and a son.

Piccoli died from complications of a stroke on 12 May 2020, at the age of 94.

== Europe Theatre Prize ==

In 2001, he was awarded the IX Europe Theatre Prize, in Taormina, with the following motivation:
Michel Piccoli began his career on the stage - his &quot;Don Juan&quot; remains celebrated - before crossing to the &quot;other shore&quot;, the cinema, finally coming to accept the relativity of travelling back and forth between the two and taking full advantage of their potential interaction. Piccoli captivates us because he is halfway between the clearly defined identity of the film actor and the ductile identity of the stage actor. When Bondy, Brook, and Chéreau turned to him, despite his reputation as a cinema performer, it was undoubtedly because of this receptiveness and adaptability. He was not trapped by an image, but brought a unique presence. He was also ready to take on an unprecedented variety of roles, which took him from Schnitzler to Chekhov and Pirandello, from Shakespeare to Koltès. The film actor was able of step back and make way for his double, the stage actor. What is it that we love about Piccoli? The fact that he is an artist who has lasted over time without turning into an effigy… he provides certainty and maintains a hidden dimension. The light does not expel the shadow, which always accompanies the brilliance of the legendary actor that he is. There is nothing one-dimensional about him. Michel Piccoli is a European figure. In him we do not see so much an international star unaware of borders, but an open-minded actor who strives to cross them. A free citizen, he does not want to become a prisoner and his whole life bears witness to this unquenched desire to go beyond limits. National as well as artistic limits. Michel Piccoli refuses civil indifference. He has never lacked commitment, and has always taken sides and got involved. His ethic is constant, whether as an actor or as a citizen. If he is taken as a model, it is always despite himself. He is not a hero who puts himself on display. More than anyone else, Piccoli has managed to maintain his humanity. A vibrant humanity that continues to guide his actions and his words. Michel Piccoli is an exemplary actor, responsible towards himself and towards his art.

<doc id="382667" wikidata="Q2997419" url="?curid=382667" title="Projective linear group">
<text>In mathematics, especially in the group theoretic area of algebra, the projective linear group (also known as the projective general linear group or PGL) is the induced action of the general linear group of a vector space &quot;V&quot; on the associated projective space P(&quot;V&quot;). Explicitly, the projective linear group is the quotient group
: PGL(&quot;V&quot;) = GL(&quot;V&quot;)/Z(&quot;V&quot;)
where GL(&quot;V&quot;) is the general linear group of &quot;V&quot; and Z(&quot;V&quot;) is the subgroup of all nonzero scalar transformations of &quot;V&quot;; these are quotiented out because they act trivially on the projective space and they form the kernel of the action, and the notation &quot;Z&quot; reflects that the scalar transformations form the center of the general linear group.

The projective special linear group, PSL, is defined analogously, as the induced action of the special linear group on the associated projective space. Explicitly:
: PSL(&quot;V&quot;) = SL(&quot;V&quot;)/SZ(&quot;V&quot;)
where SL(&quot;V&quot;) is the special linear group over &quot;V&quot; and SZ(&quot;V&quot;) is the subgroup of scalar transformations with unit determinant. Here SZ is the center of SL, and is naturally identified with the group of &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity in &quot;F&quot; (where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is the base field).

PGL and PSL are some of the fundamental groups of study, part of the so-called classical groups, and an element of PGL is called projective linear transformation, projective transformation or [[homography]]. If &quot;V&quot; is the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space over a field &quot;F&quot;, namely , the alternate notations and are also used.

Note that and are isomorphic if and only if every element of &quot;F&quot; has an &quot;n&quot;th root in &quot;F&quot;. As an example, note that , but that ; this corresponds to the real projective line being orientable, and the projective special linear group only being the orientation-preserving transformations.

PGL and PSL can also be defined over a ring, with an important example being the modular group, .

== Name ==
The name comes from projective geometry, where the projective group acting on homogeneous coordinates (&quot;x&quot;0 : &quot;x&quot;1 : ... : &quot;xn&quot;) is the underlying group of the geometry. Stated differently, the natural action of GL(&quot;V&quot;) on &quot;V&quot; descends to an action of PGL(&quot;V&quot;) on the projective space &quot;P&quot;(&quot;V&quot;).

The projective linear groups therefore generalise the case of Möbius transformations (sometimes called the Möbius group), which acts on the projective line.

Note that unlike the general linear group, which is generally defined axiomatically as &quot;invertible functions preserving the linear (vector space) structure&quot;, the projective linear group is defined &quot;constructively,&quot; as a quotient of the general linear group of the associated vector space, rather than axiomatically as &quot;invertible functions preserving the projective linear structure&quot;. This is reflected in the notation: is the group associated to , and is the projective linear group of -dimensional projective space, not &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space.

=== Collineations ===

A related group is the collineation group, which is defined axiomatically. A collineation is an invertible (or more generally one-to-one) map which sends collinear points to collinear points. One can define a projective space axiomatically in terms of an incidence structure (a set of points &quot;P&quot;, lines &quot;L&quot;, and an incidence relation &quot;I&quot; specifying which points lie on which lines) satisfying certain axioms – an automorphism of a projective space thus defined then being an automorphism &quot;f&quot; of the set of points and an automorphism &quot;g&quot; of the set of lines, preserving the incidence relation, which is exactly a collineation of a space to itself. Projective linear transforms are collineations (planes in a vector space correspond to lines in the associated projective space, and linear transforms map planes to planes, so projective linear transforms map lines to lines), but in general not all collineations are projective linear transforms – PGL is in general a proper subgroup of the collineation group.

Specifically, for (a projective line), all points are collinear, so the collineation group is exactly the symmetric group of the points of the projective line, and except for F2 and F3 (where PGL is the full symmetric group), PGL is a proper subgroup of the full symmetric group on these points.

For , the collineation group is the projective semilinear group, PΓL – this is PGL, twisted by field automorphisms; formally, , where &quot;k&quot; is the prime field for &quot;K&quot;; this is the fundamental theorem of projective geometry. Thus for &quot;K&quot; a prime field (F&quot;p&quot; or Q), we have , but for &quot;K&quot; a field with non-trivial Galois automorphisms (such as F&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; for or C), the projective linear group is a proper subgroup of the collineation group, which can be thought of as &quot;transforms preserving a projective &quot;semi&quot;-linear structure&quot;. Correspondingly, the quotient group corresponds to &quot;choices of linear structure&quot;, with the identity (base point) being the existing linear structure.

One may also define collineation groups for axiomatically defined projective spaces, where there is no natural notion of a projective &quot;linear&quot; transform. However, with the exception of the non-Desarguesian planes, all projective spaces are the projectivization of a linear space over a division ring though, as noted above, there are multiple choices of linear structure, namely a torsor over Gal(&quot;K&quot;/&quot;k&quot;) (for ).

== Elements ==
The elements of the projective linear group can be understood as &quot;tilting the plane&quot; along one of the axes, and then projecting to the original plane, and also have dimension &quot;n&quot;.
A more familiar geometric way to understand the projective transforms is via projective rotations (the elements of ), which corresponds to the stereographic projection of rotations of the unit hypersphere, and has dimension . Visually, this corresponds to standing at the origin (or placing a camera at the origin), and turning one&#x27;s angle of view, then projecting onto a flat plane. Rotations in axes perpendicular to the hyperplane preserve the hyperplane and yield a rotation of the hyperplane (an element of SO(&quot;n&quot;), which has dimension .), while rotations in axes parallel to the hyperplane are proper projective maps, and accounts for the remaining &quot;n&quot; dimensions.

== Properties ==
* PGL sends collinear points to collinear points (it preserves projective lines), but it is not the full collineation group, which is instead either PΓL (for ) or the full symmetric group for (the projective line).
* Every (biregular) algebraic automorphism of a projective space is projective linear. The birational automorphisms form a larger group, the Cremona group.
* PGL acts faithfully on projective space: non-identity elements act non-trivially. Concretely, the kernel of the action of GL on projective space is exactly the scalar maps, which are quotiented out in PGL.
* PGL acts 2-transitively on projective space. This is because 2 distinct points in projective space correspond to 2 vectors that do not lie on a single linear space, and hence are linearly independent, and GL acts transitively on &quot;k&quot;-element sets of linearly independent vectors.
* acts sharply 3-transitively on the projective line. Three arbitrary points are conventionally mapped to [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0]; in alternative notation, 0, 1, ∞. In fractional linear transformation notation, the function maps , , , and is the unique such map that does so. This is the cross-ratio – see &quot;&quot; for details.
* For , does not act 3-transitively, because it must send 3 collinear points to 3 other collinear points, not an arbitrary set. For the space is the projective line, so all points are collinear and this is no restriction.
* does not act 4-transitively on the projective line (except for , as P1(3) has points, so 3-transitive implies 4-transitive); the invariant that is preserved is the cross ratio, and this determines where every other point is sent: specifying where 3 points are mapped determines the map. Thus in particular it is not the full collineation group of the projective line (except for F2 and F3).
* and (for , and &quot;q&quot; odd for PSL) are two of the four families of Zassenhaus groups.
* is an algebraic group of dimension and an open subgroup of the projective space P&quot;n&quot;2−1. As defined, the functor does not define an algebraic group, or even an fppf sheaf, and its sheafification in the fppf topology is in fact .
* PSL and PGL are centerless – this is because the diagonal matrices are not only the center, but also the hypercenter (the quotient of a group by its center is not necessarily centerless).

=== Fractional linear transformations ===

As for Möbius transformations, the group can be interpreted as fractional linear transformations with coefficients in &quot;K&quot;. Points in the projective line over &quot;K&quot; correspond to pairs from &quot;K&quot;2, with two pairs being equivalent when they are proportional. When the second coordinate is non-zero, a point can be represented by . Then when , the action of is by linear transformation:
: formula_1
In this way successive transformations can be written as right multiplication by such matrices, and matrix multiplication can be used for the group product in .

== Finite fields ==
The projective special linear groups for a finite field F&quot;q&quot; are often written as or &quot;L&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;q&quot;). They are finite simple groups whenever &quot;n&quot; is at least 2, with two exceptions: &quot;L&quot;2(2), which is isomorphic to S3, the symmetric group on 3 letters, and is solvable; and &quot;L&quot;2(3), which is isomorphic to A4, the alternating group on 4 letters, and is also solvable. These exceptional isomorphisms can be understood as arising from the action on the projective line.

The special linear groups are thus quasisimple: perfect central extensions of a simple group (unless and or 3).

=== History ===
The groups for any prime number p were constructed by Évariste Galois in the 1830s, and were the second family of finite simple groups, after the alternating groups. Galois constructed them as fractional linear transforms, and observed that they were simple except if &quot;p&quot; was 2 or 3; this is contained in his last letter to Chevalier. In the same letter and attached manuscripts, Galois also constructed the general linear group over a prime field, , in studying the Galois group of the general equation of degree &quot;p&quot;&quot;ν&quot;.

The groups (general &quot;n&quot;, general finite field) for any prime power &quot;q&quot; were then constructed in the classic 1870 text by Camille Jordan, &quot;Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques.&quot;

=== Order ===
The order of is
: (&quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1)(&quot;qn&quot; − &quot;q&quot;)(&quot;qn&quot; − &quot;q&quot;2) ⋅⋅⋅ (&quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot; − &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1)/(&quot;q&quot; − 1) = &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;2−1 − O(&quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;2−3),
which corresponds to the order of, divided by for projectivization; see &quot;q&quot;-analog for discussion of such formulas. Note that the degree is , which agrees with the dimension as an algebraic group. The &quot;O&quot; is for big O notation, meaning &quot;terms involving lower order&quot;. This also equals the order of ; there dividing by is due to the determinant.

The order of is the order of as above, divided by . This is equal to , the number of scalar matrices with determinant 1; , the number of classes of element that have no &quot;n&quot;th root; and it is also the number of &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity in F&quot;q&quot;.

=== Exceptional isomorphisms ===
In addition to the isomorphisms
: , , and ,
there are other exceptional isomorphisms between projective special linear groups and alternating groups (these groups are all simple, as the alternating group over 5 or more letters is simple):
: &quot;L&quot;2(4) ≅ A5
: &quot;L&quot;2(5) ≅ A5 (see &quot;&quot; for a proof)
: &quot;L&quot;2(9) ≅ A6
: &quot;L&quot;4(2) ≅ A8 
The isomorphism allows one to see the exotic outer automorphism of A6 in terms of field automorphism and matrix operations. The isomorphism is of interest in the structure of the Mathieu group M24.

The associated extensions are covering groups of the alternating groups (universal perfect central extensions) for A4, A5, by uniqueness of the universal perfect central extension; for , the associated extension is a perfect central extension, but not universal: there is a 3-fold covering group.

The groups over F5 have a number of exceptional isomorphisms:
: , the alternating group on five elements, or equivalently the icosahedral group;
: , the symmetric group on five elements;
: the double cover of the alternating group A5, or equivalently the binary icosahedral group.
They can also be used to give a construction of an exotic map, as described below. Note however that is not a double cover of S5, but is rather a 4-fold cover.

A further isomorphism is:
: is the simple group of order 168, the second-smallest non-abelian simple group, and is not an alternating group; see &quot;PSL(2, 7)&quot;.

The above exceptional isomorphisms involving the projective special linear groups are almost all of the exceptional isomorphisms between families of finite simple groups; the only other exceptional isomorphism is PSU(4, 2) ≃ PSp(4, 3), between a projective special unitary group and a projective symplectic group.

==== Action on projective line ====
Some of the above maps can be seen directly in terms of the action of PSL and PGL on the associated projective line: acts on the projective space P&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;q&quot;), which has points, and this yields a map from the projective linear group to the symmetric group on points. For , this is the projective line P1(&quot;q&quot;) which has points, so there is a map .

To understand these maps, it is useful to recall these facts:
* The order of is
*: (&quot;q&quot;2 − 1)(&quot;q&quot;2 − &quot;q&quot;)/(&quot;q&quot; − 1) = &quot;q&quot;3 − &quot;q&quot; = (&quot;q&quot; − 1)&quot;q&quot;(&quot;q&quot; + 1);
: the order of either equals this (if the characteristic is 2), or is half this (if the characteristic is not 2).
* The action of the projective linear group on the projective line is sharply 3-transitive (faithful and 3-transitive), so the map is one-to-one and has image a 3-transitive subgroup.
Thus the image is a 3-transitive subgroup of known order, which allows it to be identified. This yields the following maps:
* , of order 6, which is an isomorphism.
** The inverse map (a projective representation of S3) can be realized by the anharmonic group, and more generally yields an embedding for all fields.
* , of orders 12 and 24, the latter of which is an isomorphism, with being the alternating group.
** The anharmonic group gives a partial map in the opposite direction, mapping as the stabilizer of the point −1.
* , of order 60, yielding the alternating group A5.
* , of orders 60 and 120, which yields an embedding of S5 (respectively, A5) as a &quot;transitive&quot; subgroup of S6 (respectively, A6). This is an example of an exotic map, and can be used to construct the exceptional outer automorphism of S6. Note that the isomorphism is not transparent from this presentation: there is no particularly natural set of 5 elements on which acts.

==== Action on &quot;p&quot; points ====
While naturally acts on points, non-trivial actions on fewer points are rarer. Indeed, for acts non-trivially on &quot;p&quot; points if and only if , 3, 5, 7, or 11; for 2 and 3 the group is not simple, while for 5, 7, and 11, the group is simple – further, it does not act non-trivially on &quot;fewer&quot; than &quot;p&quot; points. This was first observed by Évariste Galois in his last letter to Chevalier, 1832.

This can be analyzed as follows; note that for 2 and 3 the action is not faithful (it is a non-trivial quotient, and the PSL group is not simple), while for 5, 7, and 11 the action is faithful (as the group is simple and the action is non-trivial), and yields an embedding into S&quot;p&quot;. In all but the last case, , it corresponds to an exceptional isomorphism, where the right-most group has an obvious action on &quot;p&quot; points:
* &quot;L&quot;2(2) ≅ S3 formula_2 S2 via the sign map;
* &quot;L&quot;2(3) ≅ A4 formula_2 A3 ≅ C3 via the quotient by the Klein 4-group;
* &quot;L&quot;2(5) ≅ A5. To construct such an isomorphism, one needs to consider the group &quot;L&quot;2(5) as a Galois group of a Galois cover &quot;a&quot;5: , where &quot;X&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) is a modular curve of level &quot;N&quot;. This cover is ramified at 12 points. The modular curve X(5) has genus 0 and is isomorphic to a sphere over the field of complex numbers, and then the action of &quot;L&quot;2(5) on these 12 points becomes the symmetry group of an icosahedron. One then needs to consider the action of the symmetry group of icosahedron on the five associated tetrahedra.
* which acts on the points of the Fano plane (projective plane over F2); this can also be seen as the action on order 2 biplane, which is the &quot;complementary&quot; Fano plane.
* &quot;L&quot;2(11) is subtler, and elaborated below; it acts on the order 3 biplane.
Further, &quot;L&quot;2(7) and &quot;L&quot;2(11) have two &quot;inequivalent&quot; actions on &quot;p&quot; points; geometrically this is realized by the action on a biplane, which has &quot;p&quot; points and &quot;p&quot; blocks – the action on the points and the action on the blocks are both actions on &quot;p&quot; points, but not conjugate (they have different point stabilizers); they are instead related by an outer automorphism of the group.

More recently, these last three exceptional actions have been interpreted as an example of the ADE classification: these actions correspond to products (as sets, not as groups) of the groups as , , and , where the groups A4, S4 and A5 are the isometry groups of the Platonic solids, and correspond to &quot;E&quot;6, &quot;E&quot;7, and &quot;E&quot;8 under the McKay correspondence. These three exceptional cases are also realized as the geometries of polyhedra (equivalently, tilings of Riemann surfaces), respectively: the compound of five tetrahedra inside the icosahedron (sphere, genus 0), the order 2 biplane (complementary Fano plane) inside the Klein quartic (genus 3), and the order 3 biplane (Paley biplane) inside the buckyball surface (genus 70).

The action of &quot;L&quot;2(11) can be seen algebraically as due to an exceptional inclusion – there are two conjugacy classes of subgroups of &quot;L&quot;2(11) that are isomorphic to &quot;L&quot;2(5), each with 11 elements: the action of &quot;L&quot;2(11) by conjugation on these is an action on 11 points, and, further, the two conjugacy classes are related by an outer automorphism of &quot;L&quot;2(11). (The same is true for subgroups of &quot;L&quot;2(7) isomorphic to S4, and this also has a biplane geometry.)

Geometrically, this action can be understood via a &quot;biplane geometry&quot;, which is defined as follows. A biplane geometry is a symmetric design (a set of points and an equal number of &quot;lines&quot;, or rather blocks) such that any set of two points is contained in two lines, while any two lines intersect in two points; this is similar to a finite projective plane, except that rather than two points determining one line (and two lines determining one point), they determine two lines (respectively, points). In this case (the Paley biplane, obtained from the Paley digraph of order 11), the points are the affine line (the finite field) F11, where the first line is defined to be the five non-zero quadratic residues (points which are squares: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9), and the other lines are the affine translates of this (add a constant to all the points). &quot;L&quot;2(11) is then isomorphic to the subgroup of S11 that preserve this geometry (sends lines to lines), giving a set of 11 points on which it acts – in fact two: the points or the lines, which corresponds to the outer automorphism – while &quot;L&quot;2(5) is the stabilizer of a given line, or dually of a given point.

More surprisingly, the coset space &quot;L&quot;2(11)/(Z/11Z), which has order (and on which the icosahedral group acts) naturally has the structure of a buckeyball, which is used in the construction of the buckyball surface.

=== Mathieu groups ===

The group can be used to construct the Mathieu group M24, one of the sporadic simple groups; in this context, one refers to as M21, though it is not properly a Mathieu group itself. One begins with the projective plane over the field with four elements, which is a Steiner system of type – meaning that it has 21 points, each line (&quot;block&quot;, in Steiner terminology) has 5 points, and any 2 points determine a line – and on which acts. One calls this Steiner system W21 (&quot;W&quot; for Witt), and then expands it to a larger Steiner system W24, expanding the symmetry group along the way: to the projective general linear group , then to the projective semilinear group , and finally to the Mathieu group M24.

M24 also contains copies of , which is maximal in M22, and , which is maximal in M24, and can be used to construct M24.

=== Hurwitz surfaces ===
PSL groups arise as Hurwitz groups (automorphism groups of Hurwitz surfaces – algebraic curves of maximal possibly symmetry group). The Hurwitz surface of lowest genus, the Klein quartic (genus 3), has automorphism group isomorphic to (equivalently ), while the Hurwitz surface of second-lowest genus, the Macbeath surface (genus 7), has automorphism group isomorphic to .

In fact, many but not all simple groups arise as Hurwitz groups (including the monster group, though not all alternating groups or sporadic groups), though PSL is notable for including the smallest such groups.

=== Modular group ===

The groups arise in studying the modular group, , as quotients by reducing all elements mod &quot;n&quot;; the kernels are called the principal congruence subgroups.

A noteworthy subgroup of the projective &quot;general&quot; linear group (and of the projective special linear group ) is the symmetries of the set which is known as the anharmonic group, and arises as the symmetries of the six cross-ratios. The subgroup can be expressed as fractional linear transformations, or represented (non-uniquely) by matrices, as:
Note that the top row is the identity and the two 3-cycles, and are orientation-preserving, forming a subgroup in , while the bottom row is the three 2-cycles, and are in and , but not in , hence realized either as matrices with determinant −1 and integer coefficients, or as matrices with determinant 1 and Gaussian integer coefficients.

This maps to the symmetries of under reduction mod &quot;n&quot;. Notably, for , this subgroup maps isomorphically to , and thus provides a splitting for the quotient map .

The fixed points of both 3-cycles are the &quot;most symmetric&quot; cross-ratios, formula_4, the solutions to (the primitive sixth roots of unity). The 2-cycles interchange these, as they do any points other than their fixed points, which realizes the quotient map by the group action on these two points. That is, the subgroup consisting of the identity and the 3-cycles, , fixes these two points, while the other elements interchange them.

The fixed points of the individual 2-cycles are, respectively, −1, 1/2, 2, and this set is also preserved and permuted by the 3-cycles. This corresponds to the action of S3 on the 2-cycles (its Sylow 2-subgroups) by conjugation and realizes the isomorphism with the group of inner automorphisms, .

Geometrically, this can be visualized as the rotation group of the triangular bipyramid, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group of the triangle ; see anharmonic group.

== Topology ==
Over the real and complex numbers, the topology of PGL and PSL can be determined from the fiber bundles that define them:
: formula_5
via the long exact sequence of a fibration.

For both the reals and complexes, SL is a covering space of PSL, with number of sheets equal to the number of &quot;n&quot;th roots in &quot;K&quot;; thus in particular all their higher homotopy groups agree. For the reals, SL is a 2-fold cover of PSL for &quot;n&quot; even, and is a 1-fold cover for &quot;n&quot; odd, i.e., an isomorphism:
: 
For the complexes, SL is an &quot;n&quot;-fold cover of PSL.

For PGL, for the reals, the fiber is , so up to homotopy, is a 2-fold covering space, and all higher homotopy groups agree.

For PGL over the complexes, the fiber is , so up to homotopy, is a circle bundle. The higher homotopy groups of the circle vanish, so the homotopy groups of and agree for . In fact, &quot;π&quot;2 always vanishes for Lie groups, so the homotopy groups agree for . For , we have that . The fundamental group of is a finite cyclic group of order 2.

=== Covering groups ===
Over the real and complex numbers, the projective special linear groups are the &quot;minimal&quot; (centerless) Lie group realizations for the special linear Lie algebra formula_6 every connected Lie group whose Lie algebra is formula_7 is a cover of . Conversely, its universal covering group is the &quot;maximal&quot; (simply connected) element, and the intermediary realizations form a lattice of covering groups.

For example,  has center and fundamental group Z, and thus has universal cover and covers the centerless .

== Representation theory ==
A group homomorphism from a group &quot;G&quot; to a projective linear group is called a projective representation of the group &quot;G&quot;, by analogy with a linear representation (a homomorphism ). These were studied by Issai Schur, who showed that &quot;projective&quot; representations of &quot;G&quot; can be classified in terms of &quot;linear&quot; representations of central extensions of &quot;G&quot;. This led to the Schur multiplier, which is used to address this question.

== Low dimensions ==
The projective linear group is mostly studied for , though it can be defined for low dimensions.

For (or in fact ) the projective space of &quot;K&quot;0 is empty, as there are no 1-dimensional subspaces of a 0-dimensional space. Thus, is the trivial group, consisting of the unique empty map from the empty set to itself. Further, the action of scalars on a 0-dimensional space is trivial, so the map is trivial, rather than an inclusion as it is in higher dimensions.

For , the projective space of &quot;K&quot;1 is a single point, as there is a single 1-dimensional subspace. Thus, is the trivial group, consisting of the unique map from a singleton set to itself. Further, the general linear group of a 1-dimensional space is exactly the scalars, so the map is an isomorphism, corresponding to being trivial.

For , is non-trivial, but is unusual in that it is 3-transitive, unlike higher dimensions when it is only 2-transitive.

== Examples ==
* PSL(2, 7)
* Modular group, 
* PSL(2, R)
* Möbius group, 

== Subgroups ==
* Projective orthogonal group, PO – maximal compact subgroup of PGL
* Projective unitary group, PU
* Projective special orthogonal group, PSO – maximal compact subgroup of PSL
* Projective special unitary group, PSU

== Larger groups ==
The projective linear group is contained within larger groups, notably:
* Projective semilinear group, PΓL, which allows field automorphisms.
* Cremona group, &quot;Cr&quot;(P&quot;n&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)) of birational automorphisms; any biregular automorphism is linear, so PGL coincides with the group of biregular automorphisms.

It is located in the Prahova Valley, at the bottom of the Bucegi Mountains, that have a maximum altitude of . Its name literally means tree-logs in Romanian. One village, Poiana Țapului, is administratively part of the town, formerly a separate commune prior to 1950. According to the 2021 census, it has 8,368 inhabitants.

Bușteni&#x27;s average altitude is . It is one of the most popular mountain resorts in Romania, with year-round tourism opportunities, including skiing and mountain climbing.

The town and the surrounding mountains were the site of military confrontations in 1916, during World War I (&quot;see Romania during World War I&quot;). A large commemorative monument (about high), Heroes&#x27; Cross (&quot;Crucea Eroilor&quot;) lies atop nearby Caraiman Peak, at nearly . The monument is lighted at night and is visible from virtually everywhere in Bușteni.

The main local industries are wood industry and tourism. Many holiday houses have been built in the town since the 2000s.

Also a new Information Tourism Center was set up near the City Hall.

<doc id="382673" wikidata="Q1589550" url="?curid=382673" title="Eastern meadowlark">
<text>The eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna) is a medium-sized icterid bird, very similar in appearance to its sister species, the western meadowlark. It occurs from eastern North America to northern South America, where it is also most widespread in the east. The Chihuahuan meadowlark was formerly considered to be conspecific with the eastern meadowlark.

==Taxonomy==
The eastern meadowlark was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the larks and pipits in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot; and adopted the binomial name &quot;Alauda magna&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;large lark&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1729–1732 by the English naturalist Mark Catesby. Catesby also used the Latin &quot;Alauda magna&quot; but as his book predates the introduction of the binomial system, he is not acknowledged as the authority. Catesby reported that &quot;they inhabit Carolina, Virginia and most of the Northern continent of America.&quot; Confusingly, Linnaeus specified the habitat as &quot;America, Africa&quot;. The type location was restricted to South Carolina by the American Ornithologist&#x27;s Union in 1931. The eastern meadowlark is now placed with the western meadowlark and Chihuahuan meadowlark in the genus &quot;Sturnella&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. The name &quot;Sturnella&quot; is a diminutive of the Latin &quot;sturnus&quot; meaning &quot;starling&quot;.

Fourteen subspecies are recognised: 
* &quot;S. m. magna&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – southeast Canada and central, east USA
* &quot;S. m. argutula&quot; Bangs, 1899 – south-central, southeast USA
* &quot;S. m. hoopesi&quot; Stone, 1897 – south Texas (south-central USA) and northeast Mexico
* &quot;S. m. saundersi&quot; Dickerman &amp; Phillips, AR, 1970 – southeast Oaxaca (south Mexico)
* &quot;S. m. alticola&quot; Nelson, 1900 – south Mexico to Costa Rica
* &quot;S. m. mexicana&quot; Sclater, PL, 1861 – southeast Mexico to Belize and Guatemala
* &quot;S. m. griscomi&quot; Van Tyne &amp; Trautman, 1941 – north Yucatán (southeast Mexico)
* &quot;S. m. inexspectata&quot; Ridgway, 1888 – Honduras and northeast Nicaragua
* &quot;S. m. subulata&quot; Griscom, 1934 – Panama
* &quot;S. m. meridionalis&quot; Sclater, PL, 1861 – north-central Colombia to northwest Venezuela
* &quot;S. m. paralios&quot; Bangs, 1901 – north Colombia and north, central Venezuela
* &quot;S. m. praticola&quot; Chubb, C, 1921 – llanos of east Colombia and southeast Venezuela to Guyana and Suriname
* &quot;S. m. monticola&quot; Chubb, C, 1921 – montane south Venezuela, the Guianas and north Brazil
* &quot;S. m. hippocrepis&quot; (Wagler, 1832) – Cuba

The list of subspecies formerly included &quot;S. m. lilianae&quot; and &quot;S. m. auropectoralis&quot;. These are now considered to be a separate species, the Chihuahuan meadowlark. The split was based on a study published in 2021 that showed that there were significant morphological, vocal and genomic differences between these two taxa and the other subspecies of the eastern meadowlark.

==Description==
The adult eastern meadowlark measures from in length and spans across the wings. Body mass ranges from . The extended wing bone measures , the tail measures , the culmen measures and the tarsus measures . Females are smaller in all physical dimensions. Adults have yellow underparts with a black &quot;V&quot; on the breast and white flanks with black streaks. The upperparts are mainly brown with black streaks. They have a long pointed bill; the head is striped with light brown and black.

The song of this bird is of pure, melancholy whistles, and thus simpler than the jumbled and flutey song of the western meadowlark; their ranges overlap across central North America. In the field, the song is often the easiest way to tell the two species apart, though plumage differences do exist, like tail pattern and malar coloration. In nonbreeding plumage, eastern meadowlarks tend to have more yellow-brown coloration in their flanks and more distinct striping on their heads.

The pale Chihuahuan meadowlark of northern Mexico and the southwestern US was recognized as a separate species by the American Ornithological Society in 2022.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is grasslands and prairie, also pastures and hay fields. This species is a permanent resident throughout much of its range, though most northern birds migrate southwards in winter. In 1993 this species was first recorded in El Salvador, and the discovery of a breeding pair in 2004 confirmed that the species is a resident there.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Breeding===
Nesting occurs throughout the summer months. The nest is also on the ground, covered with a roof woven from grasses. There may be more than one nesting female in a male&#x27;s territory.
Nests are placed on the ground in depressions 1 to 3 inches deep, such as in the hoofprints of cattle, in pastures, meadows, hay fields, and on the edges of marshes. The nests are made of dried grass and plant stems, and are lined with grass lespedezas, pine needles, or horse hair.

===Food and feeding===
These birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation, sometimes probing with the bill. They mainly eat arthropods, but also seeds and berries. In winter, they often feed in flocks. About three-quarters of the eastern meadowlark&#x27;s diet is from animal sources like beetles, grasshoppers, and crickets. They also eat grain and seeds.

== Conservation status==
The numbers of this species increased as forests were cleared in eastern North America. This species is ideally suited to farmland areas, especially where tall grasses are allowed to grow. Their numbers are now shrinking with a decline in suitable habitat. On the other hand, its range is expanding in parts of Central America toward the Pacific (western) side of the continent, in agricultural-type areas.

Eastern meadowlarks are species at risk in Nova Scotia and the subject of agricultural conservation program seeking to reduce mortality through modified practices. Allowing marginal areas of fields on farms to seed with grass can provide nesting habitat for meadowlarks and all grassland birds. Delaying hay harvest can also improve survival, giving young meadowlarks a chance of fledging

<doc id="382683" wikidata="Q263421" url="?curid=382683" title="Landing gear">
<text>Landing gear is the undercarriage of an aircraft or spacecraft that is used for taxiing, takeoff or landing. For aircraft, it is generally needed for all three of these. It was also formerly called &quot;alighting gear&quot; by some manufacturers, such as the Glenn L. Martin Company. For aircraft, Stinton makes the terminology distinction &quot;undercarriage (British) = landing gear (US)&quot;.

For aircraft, the landing gear supports the craft when it is not flying, allowing it to take off, land, and taxi without damage. Wheeled landing gear is the most common, with skis or floats needed to operate from snow/ice/water and skids for vertical operation on land. Retractable undercarriages fold away during flight, which reduces drag, allowing for faster airspeeds. Landing gear must be strong enough to support the aircraft and its design affects the weight, balance and performance. It often comprises three wheels, or wheel-sets, giving a tripod effect.

Some unusual landing gear have been evaluated experimentally. These include: no landing gear (to save weight), made possible by operating from a catapult cradle and flexible landing deck: air cushion (to enable operation over a wide range of ground obstacles and water/snow/ice); tracked (to reduce runway loading).

For launch vehicles and spacecraft landers, the landing gear usually only supports the vehicle on landing and during subsequent surface movement, and is not used for takeoff.

Given their varied designs and applications, there exist dozens of specialized landing gear manufacturers. The three largest are Safran Landing Systems, Collins Aerospace (part of Raytheon Technologies) and Héroux-Devtek.

==Aircraft==
The landing gear represents 2.5 to 5% of the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) and 1.5 to 1.75% of the aircraft cost, but 20% of the airframe direct maintenance cost. A suitably-designed wheel can support , tolerate a ground speed of 300 km/h and roll a distance of ; it has a 20,000 hours time between overhaul and a 60,000 hours or 20 year life time.

===Gear arrangements===
Wheeled undercarriages normally come in two types: 
* &quot;Conventional landing gear&quot; or &quot;taildragger&quot;, where there are two main wheels towards the front of the aircraft and a single, much smaller, wheel or skid at the rear. The same helicopter arrangement is called tricycle tailwheel.
* &quot;Tricycle landing gear&quot;, where there are two main wheels (or wheel assemblies) under the wings and a third smaller wheel in the nose. PZL.37 Łoś Was the first bomber aircraft with twin wheels on a single shock absorber. The same helicopter arrangement is called tricycle nosewheel.
The taildragger arrangement was common during the early propeller era, as it allows more room for propeller clearance. Most modern aircraft have tricycle undercarriages. Taildraggers are considered harder to land and take off (because the arrangement is usually &quot;unstable&quot;, that is, a small deviation from straight-line travel will tend to increase rather than correct itself), and usually require special pilot training. A small tail wheel or skid/bumper may be added to a tricycle undercarriage to prevent damage to the underside of the fuselage if over-rotation occurs on take-off leading to a tail strike. Aircraft with tail-strike protection include the B-29 Superfortress, Boeing 727 trijet and Concorde. Some aircraft with retractable conventional landing gear have a fixed tailwheel. Hoerner estimated the drag of the Bf 109 fixed tailwheel and compared it with that of other protrusions such as the pilot&#x27;s canopy.

A third arrangement (known as tandem or bicycle) has the main and nose gear located fore and aft of the center of gravity (CG) under the fuselage with outriggers on the wings. This is used when there is no convenient location on either side of the fuselage to attach the main undercarriage or to store it when retracted. Examples include the Lockheed U-2 spy plane and the Harrier jump jet. The Boeing B-52 uses a similar arrangement, except that the fore and aft gears each have two twin-wheel units side by side.

Quadricycle gear is similar to bicycle but with two sets of wheels displaced laterally in the fore and aft positions. Raymer classifies the B-52 gear as quadricycle. The experimental Fairchild XC-120 Packplane had quadricycle gear located in the engine nacelles to allow unrestricted access beneath the fuselage for attaching a large freight container.

Helicopters use skids, pontoons or wheels depending on their size and role.

=== Retractable gear ===
To decrease drag in flight, undercarriages retract into the wings and/or fuselage with wheels flush with the surrounding surface, or concealed behind flush-mounted doors; this is called &quot;retractable gear.&quot; If the wheels do not retract completely but protrude partially exposed to the airstream, it is called a semi-retractable gear.

Most retractable gear is hydraulically operated, though some is electrically operated or even manually operated on very light aircraft. The landing gear is stowed in a compartment called a wheel well.

Pilots confirming that their landing gear is down and locked refer to &quot;three greens&quot; or &quot;three in the green.&quot;, a reference to the electrical indicator lights (or painted panels of mechanical indicator units) from the nosewheel/tailwheel and the two main gears. Blinking green lights or red lights indicate the gear is in transit and neither up and locked or down and locked. When the gear is fully stowed up with the up-locks secure, the lights often extinguish to follow the dark cockpit philosophy; some airplanes have gear up indicator lights.

Redundant systems are used to operate the landing gear and redundant main gear legs may also be provided so the aircraft can be landed in a satisfactory manner in a range of failure scenarios. The Boeing 747 was given four separate and independent hydraulic systems (when previous airliners had two) and four main landing gear posts (when previous airliners had two). Safe landing would be possible if two main gear legs were torn off provided they were on opposite sides of the fuselage. In the case of power failure in a light aircraft, an emergency extension system is always available. This may be a manually operated crank or pump, or a mechanical free-fall mechanism which disengages the uplocks and allows the landing gear to fall under gravity.

===Shock absorbers===

Aircraft landing gear includes wheels equipped with solid shock absorbers on light planes, and air/oil oleo struts on larger aircraft.

===Large aircraft===
As aircraft weights have increased more wheels have been added and runway thickness has increased to keep within the runway loading limit. The Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI, a large German World War I long-range bomber of 1916, used eighteen wheels for its undercarriage, split between two wheels on its nose gear struts, and sixteen wheels on its main gear units—split into four side-by-side quartets each, two quartets of wheels per side—under each tandem engine nacelle, to support its loaded weight of almost .

Multiple &quot;tandem wheels&quot; on an aircraft—particularly for cargo aircraft, mounted to the fuselage lower sides as retractable main gear units on modern designs—were first seen during World War II, on the experimental German Arado Ar 232 cargo aircraft, which used a row of eleven &quot;twinned&quot; fixed wheel sets directly under the fuselage centerline to handle heavier loads while on the ground. Many of today&#x27;s large cargo aircraft use this arrangement for their retractable main gear setups, usually mounted on the lower corners of the central fuselage structure.

The prototype Convair XB-36 had most of its weight on two main wheels, which needed runways at least thick. Production aircraft used two four-wheel bogies, allowing the aircraft to use any airfield suitable for a B-29.

A relatively light Lockheed JetStar business jet, with four wheels supporting , needed a thick flexible asphalt pavement. The Boeing 727-200 with four tires on two legs main landing gears required a thick pavement. The thickness rose to for a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 with supported on eight wheels on two legs. The heavier, , DC-10-30/40 were able to operate from the same thickness pavements with a third main leg for ten wheels, like the first Boeing 747-100, weighing on four legs and 16 wheels. The similar-weight Lockheed C-5, with 24 wheels, needs an pavement.

The twin-wheel unit on the fuselage centerline of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30/40 was retained on the MD-11 airliner and the same configuration was used on the initial Airbus A340-200/300, which evolved in a complete four-wheel undercarriage bogie for the heavier Airbus A340-500/-600. The up to Boeing 777 has twelve main wheels on two three-axles bogies, like the later Airbus A350.

The Airbus A380 has a four-wheel bogie under each wing with two sets of six-wheel bogies under the fuselage. The Antonov An-225, the largest cargo aircraft, had 4 wheels on the twin-strut nose gear units like the smaller Antonov An-124, and 28 main gear wheels.

The A321neo has a twin-wheel main gear inflated to 15.7 bar (228 psi), while the A350-900 has a four-wheel main gear inflated to 17.1 bar (248 psi).

===STOL aircraft===
STOL aircraft have a higher sink-rate requirement if a carrier-type, no-flare landing technique has to be adopted to reduce touchdown scatter. For example, the Saab 37 Viggen, with landing gear designed for a 5m/sec impact, could use a carrier-type landing and HUD to reduce its scatter from 300 m to 100m.

The de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou used long-stroke legs to land from a steep approach with no float.

===Operation from water===
A flying boat has a lower fuselage with the shape of a boat hull giving it buoyancy. Wing-mounted floats or stubby wing-like sponsons are added for stability. Sponsons are attached to the lower sides of the fuselage.

A floatplane has two or three streamlined floats. Amphibious floats have retractable wheels for land operation.

An amphibious aircraft or amphibian usually has two distinct landing gears, namely a &quot;boat&quot; hull/floats and retractable wheels, which allow it to operate from land or water.

Beaching gear is detachable wheeled landing gear that allows a non-amphibious floatplane or flying boat to be maneuvered on land. It is used for aircraft maintenance and storage and is either carried in the aircraft or kept at a slipway. Beaching gear may consist of individual detachable wheels or a cradle that supports the entire aircraft. In the former case, the beaching gear is manually attached or detached with the aircraft in the water; in the latter case, the aircraft is maneuvered onto the cradle.

Helicopters are able to land on water using floats or a hull and floats.

For take-off a step and planing bottom are required to lift from the floating position to planing on the surface. For landing a cleaving action is required to reduce the impact with the surface of the water. A vee bottom parts the water and chines deflect the spray to prevent it damaging vulnerable parts of the aircraft. Additional spray control may be needed using spray strips or inverted gutters. A step is added to the hull, just behind the center of gravity, to stop water clinging to the afterbody so the aircraft can accelerate to flying speed. The step allows air, known as ventilation air, to break the water suction on the afterbody. Two steps were used on the Kawanishi H8K. A step increases the drag in flight. The drag contribution from the step can be reduced with a fairing. A faired step was introduced on the Short Sunderland III.

One goal of seaplane designers was the development of an open ocean seaplane capable of routine operation from very rough water. This led to changes in seaplane hull configuration. High length/beam ratio hulls and extended afterbodies improved rough water capabilities. A hull much longer than its width also reduced drag in flight. An experimental development of the Martin Marlin, the Martin M-270, was tested with a new hull with a greater length/beam ratio of 15 obtained by adding 6 feet to both the nose and tail. Rough-sea capability can be improved with lower take-off and landing speeds because impacts with waves are reduced. The Shin Meiwa US-1A is a STOL amphibian with blown flaps and all control surfaces. The ability to land and take-off at relatively low speeds of about 45 knots and the hydrodynamic features of the hull, long length/beam ratio and inverted spray gutter for example, allow operation in wave heights of 15 feet. The inverted gutters channel spray to the rear of the propeller discs.

Low speed maneuvring is necessary between slipways and buoys and take-off and landing areas. Water rudders are used on seaplanes ranging in size from the Republic RC-3 Seabee to the Beriev A-40 Hydro flaps were used on the Martin Marlin and Martin SeaMaster. Hydroflaps, submerged at the rear of the afterbody, act as a speed brake or differentially as a rudder. A fixed fin, known as a skeg, has been used for directional stability. A skeg, was added to the second step on the Kawanishi H8K flying boat hull.

High speed impacts in rough water between the hull and wave flanks may be reduced using hydro-skis which hold the hull out of the water at higher speeds. Hydro skis replace the need for a boat hull and only require a plain fuselage which planes at the rear. Alternatively skis with wheels can be used for land-based aircraft which start and end their flight from a beach or floating barge. Hydro-skis with wheels were demonstrated as an all-purpose landing gear conversion of the Fairchild C-123, known as the Panto-base Stroukoff YC-134. A seaplane designed from the outset with hydro-skis was the Convair F2Y Sea Dart prototype fighter. The skis incorporated small wheels, with a third wheel on the fuselage, for ground handling.

In the 1950s hydro-skis were envisaged as a ditching aid for large piston-engined aircraft. Water-tank tests done using models of the Lockheed Constellation, Douglas DC-4 and Lockheed Neptune concluded that chances of survival and rescue would be greatly enhanced by preventing critical damage associated with ditching.

===Shipboard operation===
The landing gear on fixed-wing aircraft that land on aircraft carriers have a higher sink-rate requirement because the aircraft are flown onto the deck with no landing flare. Other features are related to catapult take-off requirements for specific aircraft. For example, the Blackburn Buccaneer was pulled down onto its tail-skid to set the required nose-up attitude. The naval McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in UK service needed an extending nosewheel leg to set the wing attitude at launch.

The landing gear for an aircraft using a ski-jump on take-off is subjected to loads of 0.5g which also last for much longer than a landing impact.

Helicopters may have a deck-lock harpoon to anchor them to the deck.

===In-flight use===
Some aircraft have a requirement to use the landing-gear as a speed brake.

Flexible mounting of the stowed main landing-gear bogies on the Tupolev Tu-22R raised the aircraft flutter speed to . The bogies oscillated within the nacelle under the control of dampers and springs as an anti-flutter device.

===Gear common to different aircraft===
Some experimental aircraft have used gear from existing aircraft to reduce program costs. The Martin-Marietta X-24 lifting body used the nose/main gear from the North American T-39 / Northrop T-38 and the Grumman X-29 from the Northrop F-5 / General Dynamics F-16.

===Other types===
==== Skids ====
Skids has been used on aircraft landing gear. The North American X-15 used skids as the rear landing gear and the Rockwell HiMAT used them in testing.

When an airplane needs to land on surfaces covered by snow, the landing gear usually consists of skis or a combination of wheels and skis.

==== Detachable ====

Some aircraft use wheels for takeoff and jettison them when airborne for improved streamlining without the complexity, weight and space requirements of a retraction mechanism. The wheels are sometimes mounted onto axles that are part of a separate &quot;dolly&quot; (for main wheels only) or &quot;trolley&quot; (for a three-wheel set with a nosewheel) chassis. Landing is done on skids or similar simple devices (fixed or retractable). The SNCASE Baroudeur used this arrangement.

Historical examples include the &quot;dolly&quot;-using Messerschmitt Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot; rocket fighter, the Messerschmitt Me 321 &quot;Gigant&quot; troop glider, and the first eight &quot;trolley&quot;-using prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance bomber. The main disadvantage to using the takeoff dolly/trolley and landing skid(s) system on German World War II aircraft—intended for a sizable number of late-war German jet and rocket-powered military aircraft designs—was that aircraft would likely be scattered all over a military airfield after they had landed from a mission, and would be unable to taxi on their own to an appropriately hidden &quot;dispersal&quot; location, which could easily leave them vulnerable to being shot up by attacking Allied fighters. A related contemporary example are the wingtip support wheels (&quot;pogos&quot;) on the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, which fall away after take-off and drop to earth; the aircraft then relies on titanium skids on the wingtips for landing.

==== Rearwards and sideways retraction ====

Some main landing gear struts on World War II aircraft, in order to allow a single-leg main gear to more efficiently store the wheel within either the wing or an engine nacelle, rotated the single gear strut through a 90° angle during the rearwards-retraction sequence to allow the main wheel to rest &quot;flat&quot; above the lower end of the main gear strut, or flush within the wing or engine nacelles, when fully retracted. Examples are the Curtiss P-40, Vought F4U Corsair, Grumman F6F Hellcat, Messerschmitt Me 210 and Junkers Ju 88. The Aero Commander family of twin-engined business aircraft also shares this feature on the main gears, which retract aft into the ends of the engine nacelles. The rearward-retracting nosewheel strut on the Heinkel He 219 and the forward-retracting nose gear strut on the later Cessna Skymaster similarly rotated 90 degrees as they retracted.

On most World War II single-engined fighter aircraft (and even one German heavy bomber design) with sideways retracting main gear, the main gear that retracted into the wings was raked forward in the &quot;down&quot; position for better ground handling, with a retracted position that placed the main wheels at some distance aft of their position when downairframe—this led to a complex angular geometry for setting up the &quot;pintle&quot; angles at the top ends of the struts for the retraction mechanism&#x27;s axis of rotation. with some aircraft, like the P-47 Thunderbolt and Grumman Bearcat, even mandating that the main gear struts lengthened as they were extended to give sufficient ground clearance for their large four-bladed propellers. One exception to the need for this complexity in many WW II fighter aircraft was Japan&#x27;s famous Zero fighter, whose main gear stayed at a perpendicular angle to the centerline of the aircraft when extended, as seen from the side.

==== Variable axial position of main wheels ====
The main wheels on the Vought F7U Cutlass could move 20 inches between a forward and aft position. The forward position was used for take-off to give a longer lever-arm for pitch control and greater nose-up attitude. The aft position was used to reduce landing bounce and reduce risk of tip-back during ground handling.

==== Tandem layout ====

The &quot;tandem&quot; or bicycle layout is used on the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, which has two main-wheels behind a single nose-wheel under the fuselage and a smaller wheel near the tip of each wing. On second generation Harriers, the wing is extended past the outrigger wheels to allow greater wing-mounted munition loads to be carried, or to permit wing-tip extensions to be bolted on for ferry flights.

A tandem layout was evaluated by Martin using a specially-modified Martin B-26 Marauder (the XB-26H) to evaluate its use on Martin&#x27;s first jet bomber, the Martin XB-48. This configuration proved so manoeuvrable that it was also selected for the B-47 Stratojet. It was also used on the U-2, Myasishchev M-4, Yakovlev Yak-25, Yak-28 and Sud Aviation Vautour. A variation of the multi tandem layout is also used on the B-52 Stratofortress which has four main wheel bogies (two forward and two aft) underneath the fuselage and a small outrigger wheel supporting each wing-tip. The B-52&#x27;s landing gear is also unique in that all four pairs of main wheels can be steered. This allows the landing gear to line up with the runway and thus makes crosswind landings easier (using a technique called &quot;crab landing&quot;). Since tandem aircraft cannot rotate for takeoff, the forward gear must be long enough to give the wings the correct angle of attack during takeoff. During landing, the forward gear must not touch the runway first, otherwise the rear gear will slam down and may cause the aircraft to bounce and become airborne again.

==== Crosswind landing accommodation ====
One very early undercarriage incorporating castoring for crosswind landings was pioneered on the Bleriot VIII design of 1908. It was later used in the much more famous Blériot XI Channel-crossing aircraft of 1909 and also copied in the earliest examples of the Etrich Taube. In this arrangement the main landing gear&#x27;s shock absorption was taken up by a vertically sliding bungee cord-sprung upper member. The vertical post along which the upper member slid to take landing shocks also had its lower end as the rotation point for the forward end of the main wheel&#x27;s suspension fork, allowing the main gear to pivot on moderate crosswind landings.

Manually-adjusted main-gear units on the B-52 can be set for crosswind take-offs. It rarely has to be used from SAC-designated airfields which have major runways in the predominant strongest wind direction. The Lockheed C-5 Galaxy has swivelling 6-wheel main units for crosswind landings and castoring rear units to prevent tire scrubbing on tight turns.

==== &quot;Kneeling&quot; gear ====
Both the nosegear and the wing-mounted main landing gear of the World War II German Arado Ar 232 cargo/transport aircraft were designed to kneel. This made it easier to load and unload cargo, and improved taxiing over ditches and on soft ground.

Some early U.S. Navy jet fighters were equipped with &quot;kneeling&quot; nose gear consisting of small steerable auxiliary wheels on short struts located forward of the primary nose gear, allowing the aircraft to be taxied tail-high with the primary nose gear retracted. This feature was intended to enhance safety aboard aircraft carriers by redirecting the hot exhaust blast upwards, and to reduce hangar space requirements by enabling the aircraft to park with its nose underneath the tail of a similarly equipped jet. Kneeling gear was used on the North American FJ-1 Fury and on early versions of the McDonnell F2H Banshee, but was found to be of little use operationally, and was omitted from later Navy fighters.

The nosewheel on the Lockheed C-5, partially retracts against a bumper to assist in loading and unloading of cargo using ramps through the forward, &quot;tilt-up&quot; hinged fuselage nose while stationary on the ground. The aircraft also tilts backwards. The Messier twin-wheel main units fitted to the Transall and other cargo aircraft can tilt forward or backward as necessary.

The Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter is able to kneel to fit inside the cargo hold of a transport aircraft and for storage.

==== Tail support ====
Aircraft landing gear includes devices to prevent fuselage contact with the ground by tipping back when the aircraft is being loaded. Some commercial aircraft have used tail props when parked at the gate. The Douglas C-54 had a critical CG location which required a ground handling strut. The Lockheed C-130 and Boeing C-17 Globemaster III use ramp supports.

The unladen CG of the rear-engined Ilyushin IL-62 is aft of the main gear due to design decisions stemming from efforts to reduce overall weight, systems complexity and drag; to prevent the fuselage from tilting back when unloaded, the aircraft has a unique fully retractable vertical tail strut with castering wheels to allow towing or pushback. The strut is not intended for taxiing or flight, when the weight of the crew, passengers, cargo and fuel provide the necessary fore-aft balance.

==== Monowheel ====
To minimize drag, modern gliders usually have a single wheel, retractable or fixed, centered under the fuselage, which is referred to as &quot;monowheel gear&quot; or &quot;monowheel landing gear&quot;. Monowheel gear is also used on some powered aircraft, where drag reduction is a priority, such as the Europa Classic. Much like the Me 163 rocket fighter, some gliders from prior to the Second World War used a take-off dolly that was jettisoned on take-off; these gliders then landed on a fixed skid. This configuration is necessarily accompanied with a taildragger.

==== Helicopters ====
Light helicopters use simple landing skids to save weight and cost. The skids may have attachment points for wheels so that they can be moved for short distances on the ground. Skids are impractical for helicopters weighing more than four tons. Some high-speed machines have retractable wheels, but most use fixed wheels for their robustness, and to avoid the need for a retraction mechanism.

==== Tailsitter ====

Experimental tailsitter aircraft use landing gear located in their tails for VTOL operation.

==== Light aircraft ====
For light aircraft a type of landing gear which is economical to produce is a simple wooden arch laminated from ash, as used on some homebuilt aircraft. A similar arched gear is often formed from spring steel. The Cessna Airmaster was among the first aircraft to use spring steel landing gear. The main advantage of such gear is that no other shock-absorbing device is needed; the deflecting leaf provides the shock absorption.

==== Folding gear ====
The limited space available to stow landing gear has led to many complex retraction mechanisms, each unique to a particular aircraft. An early example, the German &quot;Bomber B&quot; combat aircraft design competition winner, the Junkers Ju 288, had a complex &quot;folding&quot; main landing gear unlike any other aircraft designed by either Axis or Allied sides in the war: its single oleo strut was only attached to the lower end of its Y-form main retraction struts, handling the twinned main gear wheels, and folding by swiveling downwards and aftwards during retraction to &quot;fold&quot; the maingear&#x27;s length to shorten it for stowage in the engine nacelle it was mounted in. However, the single pivot-point design also led to numerous incidents of collapsed maingear units for its prototype airframes.

==== Tracked ====
Increased contact area can be obtained with very large wheels, many smaller wheels or track-type gear. Tracked gear made by Dowty was fitted to a Westland Lysander in 1938 for taxi tests, then a Fairchild Cornell and a Douglas Boston. Bonmartini, in Italy, fitted tracked gear to a Piper Cub in 1951. Track-type gear was also tested using a C-47, C-82 and B-50. A much heavier aircraft, an XB-36, was made available for further tests, although there was no intention of using it on production aircraft. The stress on the runway was reduced to one third that of the B-36 four-wheel bogie.
=== Ground carriage ===
Ground carriage is a long-term (after 2030) concept of flying without landing gear. It is one of many aviation technologies being proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Leaving the landing gear on the ground reduces weight and drag. Leaving it behind after take-off was done for a different reason, i.e. with military objectives, during World War II using the &quot;dolly&quot; and &quot;trolley&quot; arrangements of the German Me 163B rocket fighter and Arado Ar 234A prototype jet recon-bomber.

===Steering===
There are several types of steering. Taildragger aircraft may be steered by rudder alone (depending upon the prop wash produced by the aircraft to turn it) with a freely pivoting tail wheel, or by a steering linkage with the tail wheel, or by &quot;differential braking&quot; (the use of independent brakes on opposite sides of the aircraft to turn the aircraft by slowing one side more sharply than the other). Aircraft with tricycle landing gear usually have a steering linkage with the nosewheel (especially in large aircraft), but some allow the nosewheel to pivot freely and use differential braking and/or the rudder to steer the aircraft, like the Cirrus SR22.

Some aircraft require that the pilot steer by using rudder pedals; others allow steering with the yoke or control stick. Some allow both. Still others have a separate control, called a &quot;tiller&quot;, used for steering on the ground exclusively.

====Rudder====
When an aircraft is steered on the ground exclusively using the rudder, it needs a substantial airflow past the rudder, which can be generated either by the forward motion of the aircraft or by propeller slipstream. Rudder steering requires considerable practice to use effectively. Although it needs airflow past the rudder, it has the advantage of not needing any friction with the ground, which makes it useful for aircraft on water, snow or ice.

====Direct====

Some aircraft link the yoke, control stick, or rudder directly to the wheel used for steering. Manipulating these controls turns the steering wheel (the nose wheel for tricycle landing gear, and the tail wheel for taildraggers). The connection may be a firm one in which any movement of the controls turns the steering wheel (and vice versa), or it may be a soft one in which a spring-like mechanism twists the steering wheel but does not force it to turn. The former provides positive steering but makes it easier to skid the steering wheel; the latter provides softer steering (making it easy to overcontrol) but reduces the probability of skidding. Aircraft with retractable gear may disable the steering mechanism wholly or partially when the gear is retracted.

====Differential braking====
Differential braking depends on asymmetric application of the brakes on the main gear wheels to turn the aircraft. For this, the aircraft must be equipped with separate controls for the right and left brakes (usually on the rudder pedals). The nose or tail wheel usually is not equipped with brakes. Differential braking requires considerable skill. In aircraft with several methods of steering that include differential braking, differential braking may be avoided because of the wear it puts on the braking mechanisms. Differential braking has the advantage of being largely independent of any movement or skidding of the nose or tailwheel.

====Tiller====
A tiller in an aircraft is a small wheel or lever, sometimes accessible to one pilot and sometimes duplicated for both pilots, that controls the steering of the aircraft while it is on the ground. The tiller may be designed to work in combination with other controls such as the rudder or yoke. In large airliners, for example, the tiller is often used as the sole means of steering during taxi, and then the rudder is used to steer during takeoff and landing, so that both aerodynamic control surfaces and the landing gear can be controlled simultaneously when the aircraft is moving at aerodynamic speeds.

===Tires and wheels===
The specified selection criterion, e.g., minimum size, weight, or pressure, are used to select suitable tires and wheels from manufacturer&#x27;s catalog and industry standards found in the Aircraft Yearbook published by the Tire and Rim Association, Inc.

====Gear loading====
The choice of the main wheel tires is made on the basis of the static loading case. The total main gear load formula_1 is calculated assuming that the aircraft is taxiing at low speed without braking:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the weight of the aircraft and formula_4 and formula_5 are the distance measured from the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity(cg) to the main and nose gear, respectively.

The choice of the nose wheel tires is based on the nose wheel load formula_6 during braking at maximum effort:

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the lift, formula_9 is the drag, formula_10 is the thrust, and formula_11 is the height of aircraft cg from the static groundline. Typical values for formula_12 on dry concrete vary from 0.35 for a simple brake system to 0.45 for an automatic brake pressure control system. As both formula_8 and formula_9 are positive, the maximum nose gear load occurs at low speed. Reverse thrust decreases the nose gear load, and hence the condition formula_15 results in the maximum value:

:formula_16

To ensure that the rated loads will not be exceeded in the static and braking conditions, a seven percent safety factor is used in the calculation of the applied loads.

====Inflation pressure====
Provided that the wheel load and configuration of the landing gear remain unchanged, the weight and volume of the tire will decrease with an increase in inflation pressure. From the flotation standpoint, a decrease in the tire contact area will induce a higher bearing stress on the pavement which may reduce the number of airfields available to the aircraft. Braking will also become less effective due to a reduction in the frictional force between the tires and the ground. In addition, the decrease in the size of the tire, and hence the size of the wheel, could pose a problem if internal brakes are to be fitted inside the wheel rims. The arguments against higher pressure are of such a nature that commercial operators generally prefer the lower pressures in order to maximize tire life and minimize runway stress. To prevent punctures from stones Philippine Airlines had to operate their Hawker Siddeley 748 aircraft with pressures as low as the tire manufacturer would permit. However, too low a pressure can lead to an accident as in the Nigeria Airways Flight 2120.

A rough general rule for required tire pressure is given by the manufacturer in their catalog. Goodyear for example advises the pressure to be 4% higher than required for a given weight or as fraction of the rated static load and inflation.

Tires of many commercial aircraft are required to be filled with nitrogen, and not subsequently diluted with more than 5% oxygen, to prevent auto-ignition of the gas which may result from overheating brakes producing volatile vapors from the tire lining.

Naval aircraft use different pressures when operating from a carrier and ashore. For example, the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye tire pressures are on ship and ashore. En-route deflation is used in the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy to suit airfield conditions at the destination but adds excessive complication to the landing gear and wheels

===Future developments===
Airport community noise is an environmental issue which has brought into focus the contribution of aerodynamic noise from the landing gear. A NASA long-term goal is to confine aircraft objectional noise to within the airport boundary. During the approach to land the landing gear is lowered several miles from touchdown and the landing gear is the dominant airframe noise source, followed by deployed highlift devices. With engines at a reduced power setting on the approach it is necessary to reduce airframe noise to make a significant reduction to total aircraft noise. The addition of add-on fairings is one approach for reducing the noise from the landing gear with a longer term approach to address noise generation during initial design.

Airline specifications require an airliner to reach up to 90,000 take-offs and landings and roll 500,000 km on the ground in its lifetime. Conventional landing gear is designed to absorb the energy of a landing and does not perform well at reducing ground-induced vibrations in the airframe during landing ground roll, taxi and take-off. Airframe vibrations and fatigue damage can be reduced using semi-active oleos which vary damping over a wide range of ground speeds and runway quality.

===Accidents===
Malfunctions or human errors (or a combination of these) related to retractable landing gear have been the cause of numerous accidents and incidents throughout aviation history. Distraction and preoccupation during the landing sequence played a prominent role in the approximately 100 gear-up landing incidents that occurred each year in the United States between 1998 and 2003. A gear-up landing, also known as a belly landing, is an accident that results from the pilot forgetting to lower the landing gear, or being unable to do so because of a malfunction. Although rarely fatal, a gear-up landing can be very expensive if it causes extensive airframe/engine damage. For propeller-driven aircraft a prop strike may require an engine overhaul.

Some aircraft have a stiffened fuselage underside or added features to minimize structural damage in a wheels-up landing. When the Cessna Skymaster was converted for a military spotting role (the O-2 Skymaster), fiberglass railings were added to the length of the fuselage; they were adequate to support the aircraft without damage if it was landed on a grassy surface.

The Bombardier Dash 8 is notorious for its landing gear problems. There were three incidents involved, all of them involving Scandinavian Airlines, flights SK1209, SK2478, and SK2867. This led to Scandinavian retiring all of its Dash 8s. The cause of these incidents was a locking mechanism that failed to work properly. This also caused concern for the aircraft for many other airlines that found similar problems, Bombardier Aerospace ordered all Dash 8s with 10,000 or more hours to be grounded, it was soon found that 19 Horizon Airlines Dash 8s had locking mechanism problems, so did 8 Austrian Airlines planes, this did cause several hundred flights to be canceled.

On September 21, 2005, JetBlue Airways Flight 292 successfully landed with its nose gear turned 90 degrees sideways, resulting in a shower of sparks and flame after touchdown.

On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight LO16 successfully belly landed at Warsaw Chopin Airport due to technical failures; all 231 people on board escaped without injury.

====Emergency extension systems====
In the event of a failure of the aircraft&#x27;s landing gear extension mechanism a backup is provided. This may be an alternate hydraulic system, a hand-crank, compressed air (nitrogen), pyrotechnic or free-fall system.

A free-fall or gravity drop system uses gravity to deploy the landing gear into the down and locked position. To accomplish this the pilot activates a switch or mechanical handle in the cockpit, which releases the up-lock. Gravity then pulls the landing gear down and deploys it. Once in position the landing gear is mechanically locked and safe to use for landing.

====Ground resonance in rotorcraft====
Rotorcraft with fully articulated rotors may experience a dangerous and self-perpetuating phenomenon known as ground resonance, in which the unbalanced rotor system vibrates at a frequency coinciding with the natural frequency of the airframe, causing the entire aircraft to violently shake or wobble in contact with the ground. Ground resonance occurs when shock is continuously transmitted to the turning rotors through the landing gear, causing the angles between the rotor blades to become uneven; this is typically triggered if the aircraft touches the ground with forward or lateral motion, or touches down on one corner of the landing gear due to sloping ground or the craft&#x27;s flight attitude. The resulting violent oscillations may cause the rotors or other parts to catastrophically fail, detach, and/or strike other parts of the airframe; this can destroy the aircraft in seconds and critically endanger persons unless the pilot immediately initiates a takeoff or closes the throttle and reduces rotor pitch. Ground resonance was cited in 34 National Transportation Safety Board incident and accident reports in the United States between 1990 and 2008.

Rotorcraft with fully articulated rotors typically have shock-absorbing landing gear designed to prevent ground resonance; however, poor landing gear maintenance and improperly inflated tires may contribute to the phenomenon. Helicopters with skid-type landing gear are less prone to ground resonance than those with wheels.

===Stowaways===
Unauthorized passengers have been known to stowaway on larger aircraft by climbing a landing gear strut and riding in the compartment meant for the wheels. There are extreme dangers to this practice, with numerous deaths reported. Dangers include a lack of oxygen at high altitude, temperatures well below freezing, crush injury or death from the gear retracting into its confined space, and falling out of the compartment during takeoff or landing.

===Launch vehicles===

Landing gear has traditionally not been used on the vast majority of launch vehicles, which take off vertically and are destroyed on falling back to earth. With some exceptions for suborbital vertical-landing vehicles (e.g., the Masten Xoie or Armadillo Aerospace&#x27;s Lunar Lander Challenge vehicle), or for spaceplanes that use the &quot;vertical takeoff, horizontal landing&quot; (VTHL) approach (e.g., the Space Shuttle orbiter, or the USAF X-37), landing gear have been largely absent from orbital vehicles during the early decades since the advent of spaceflight technology, when orbital space transport has been the exclusive preserve of national-monopoly governmental space programs. Each spaceflight system through 2015 had relied on expendable boosters to begin each ascent to orbital velocity.

Advances during the 2010s in private space transport, where new competition to governmental space initiatives has emerged, have included the explicit design of landing gear into orbital booster rockets. SpaceX has initiated and funded a multimillion-dollar reusable launch system development program to pursue this objective. As part of this program, SpaceX built, and flew eight times in 2012–2013, a first-generation test vehicle called Grasshopper with a large fixed landing gear in order to test low-altitude vehicle dynamics and control for vertical landings of a near-empty orbital first stage. A second-generation test vehicle called F9R Dev1 was built with extensible landing gear. The prototype was flown four times—with all landing attempts successful—in 2014 for low-altitude tests before being self-destructed for safety reasons on a fifth test flight due to a blocked engine sensor port.

The orbital-flight version of the test vehicles–Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy—includes a lightweight, deployable landing gear for the booster stage: a nested, telescoping piston on an A-frame. The total span of the four carbon fiber/aluminum extensible landing legs is approximately , and weigh less than ; the deployment system uses high-pressure helium as the working fluid.
The first test of the extensible landing gear was successfully accomplished in April 2014 on a Falcon 9 returning from an orbital launch and was the first successful controlled ocean soft touchdown of a liquid-rocket-engine orbital booster. After a single successful booster recovery in 2015, and several in 2016, the recovery of SpaceX booster stages became routine by 2017. Landing legs had become an ordinary operational part of orbital spaceflight launch vehicles.

The newest launch vehicle under development at SpaceX—the Starship—is expected to have landing legs on its first stage called Super Heavy like Falcon 9 but also has landing legs on its reusable second stage, a first for launch vehicle second stages. The first prototype of Starship—&quot;Starhopper&quot;, built in early 2019—had three fixed landing legs with replaceable shock absorbers. In order to reduce mass of the flight vehicle and the payload penalty for a reusable design, the long-term plan is for Super Heavy to land directly back at the launch site on special ground equipment that is part of the launch mount.

===Landers===
Spacecraft designed to land safely on extraterrestrial bodies such as the Moon or Mars are known as either legged landers (for example the Apollo Lunar Module) or pod landers (for example Mars Pathfinder) depending on their landing gear. Pod landers are designed to land in any orientation after which they may bounce and roll before coming to rest at which time they have to be given the correct orientation to function. The whole vehicle is enclosed in crushable material or airbags for the impacts and may have opening petals to right it.

Features for landing and movement on the surface were combined in the landing gear for the Mars Science Laboratory.

For landing on low-gravity bodies landing gear may include hold-down thrusters, harpoon anchors and foot-pad screws, all of which were incorporated in the design of comet-lander &quot;Philae&quot; for redundancy. 

In the case of &quot;Philae&quot;, however, both harpoons and the hold-down thruster failed, resulting in the craft bouncing before landing for good at a non-optimal orientation.

<doc id="382686" wikidata="Q1368136" url="?curid=382686" title="Western meadowlark">
<text>The western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) is a medium-sized icterid bird, about in length. It is found across western and central North America and is a full migrant, breeding in Canada and the United States with resident populations also found in Mexico. The western meadowlark nests on the ground in open grasslands and shrublands. It feeds on bugs and seeds. The western meadowlark has distinctive calls described as watery or flute-like, which distinguish it from the closely related eastern meadowlark. The western meadowlark is the state bird of six states: Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, and Wyoming.

== Taxonomy ==
The western meadowlark was formally described in 1844 by the American ornithologist John James Audubon under its current binomial name &quot;Sturnella neglecta&quot;. The specific epithet is from the Latin meaning &quot;ignored&quot;, &quot;overlooked&quot;, &quot;neglected&quot; or &quot;disregarded&quot;. Audubon explained that although the account of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1803–1806 mentioned yellow larks, these had never been formally described. The type locality is Old Fort Union, North Dakota.

Despite having &quot;lark&quot; in their name due to their melodic song, they are not true larks, as they are instead in the New World blackbird family.

Two subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;S. n. neglecta&quot; Audubon, 1844 – southwest, south central Canada through the west US (except coastal Pacific Northwest) to central Mexico
* &quot;S. n. confluenta&quot; Rathbun, 1917 – coastal southwest Canada and northwest US (southwest British Columbia to Oregon)

Western meadowlarks will occasionally interbreed with eastern meadowlarks where their ranges overlap; however, resulting young appear to have low fertility.

==Description==

Western meadowlark adults have yellow underparts with a black &quot;V&quot; on the breast and white flanks streaked with black. Their upper parts are mostly brown, but also have black streaks. These birds have long, pointed bills and their heads are striped with light brown and black bands.

Measurements:
* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

These birds have a flute-like warbled song. These calls contrast with the simple, whistled call of the eastern meadowlark.

==Distribution and habitat==

The breeding habitats of western meadowlarks are grasslands, prairies, pastures, and abandoned fields, all of which may be found across western and central North America, as far south as northern Mexico. In regions where their range overlaps with the eastern species, these birds prefer thinner, drier vegetation; the two type of birds generally do not interbreed but do defend territory against one another. Their nests are situated on the ground and are covered with a roof woven from grass. There may be more than one nesting female in a male&#x27;s territory. Nests are sometimes destroyed by mowing operations with eggs and young in them.

Western meadowlarks are permanent residents throughout much of their range. Northern birds may migrate to the southern parts of their range; some birds also move east in the southern United States.

It has also been introduced to Hawaii to control insects, and is now found on the island of Kauai. Attempted introductions to other islands failed, likely due to the presence of the small Indian mongoose, which is absent from Kauai.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===

The nest is built by the female soon after arrival on the breeding grounds. The nest is placed in a concealed location on the ground. It is variable in form and ranges from a simple cup to a partially roofed structure with a runway extending from the nest entrance. Eggs are laid at daily intervals. Incubation only begins after the last egg is laid. The eggs measure on average and have brownish spots and blotches on a white ground. The eggs hatch over a period of one or two days after being incubated by the female for 13–15 days. The young are altricial and nearly naked; their eyes are closed until the 4th day. Only the female broods the chicks. The nestlings are almost exclusively fed insects. The male brings food to the nest which is then usually fed to the chicks by the female. The young fledge at 10–12 days but are only capable of sustained flight at around 21 days. The young receive parental care for around 2 weeks after fledging. A second brood is attempted.

The nests are parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;).

These birds forage on the ground or in low to semi-low vegetation. They sometimes search for food by probing with their bills. They mainly eat insects, although they will consume seeds and berries. In winter, these birds often feed in flocks.

==Relationship to humans==
The western meadowlark is the state bird of six states: Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, and Wyoming. The northern cardinal, which represents seven states, is the only bird to hold the status of state bird in more states.

During the 2017 regular session of the Oregon Legislature, there was a short-lived controversy over the western meadowlark&#x27;s status as state bird versus the osprey. The sometimes-spirited debate included state representative Rich Vial playing the meadowlark&#x27;s song on his smartphone over the House microphone. A compromise was reached in SCR 18, which was passed on the last day of the session, designating the western meadowlark as the state songbird and the osprey as the state raptor.

<text>Otford is a village and civil parish in the Sevenoaks District of Kent, England. It lies on the River Darent, north of Sevenoaks. Otford&#x27;s four churches are the Anglican Church of St Bartholomew in the village centre, the Otford Methodist Church, the Most Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church, and the Otford Evangelical Church. By the village pond, there are pubs, cafes and shops. The village has three schools, Otford Primary School, St Michael&#x27;s Prep School, and Russell House.

==History==
Otford&#x27;s earliest history and archaeology shows occupation for at least 3,000 years. Occupants have included Iron Age farmers, Romans, archbishops, and royalty, and major events include two battles. The etymology of the village name is disputed: an article in the &quot;Kent and Sussex Courier&quot; claims that Otford is a contraction of &quot;Ottansford&quot;, meaning the ford of Otta, a local man of importance.

===Roman===
A Roman villa in what is now Otford was abandoned during the 4th century, approximately 1700 years ago. The remains were re-discovered and excavated during the 1930s, and again in 2015 by the West Kent Archeological Society. It is at least twice the size of nearby Lullingstone villa.

===Saxon===
Otford was made part of the Hundred of Codsheath, one of the nine Hundreds making up the Lathe of Sutton at Hone in about the 6th century AD. Lathes were Saxon administrative regions.

From to 750, during the early medieval period, Polhill Anglo-Saxon cemetery was used as a place of burial. The archaeologist Brian Philp suggested that the community who buried their dead at Polhill likely lived at Otford, noting that from the centre of the village, the cemetery was visible.

The name Otford may be a contraction of &quot;Otterford&quot;, possibly derived from Offa, the King of Mercia who fought the Kentish Saxons in 776 at the Battle of Otford. &quot;The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 3&quot;, published 1797, indicates that Otford&#x27;s Saxon name was &quot;Ottanford&quot;. It further notes that: &quot;In 791, Offa, king of Mercia, whose gifts to the British churches and monasteries in general were great and munificent, gave Otteford to the church of Canterbury.&quot;
Priest Werhard, kinsman of archbishop Wulfred briefly took possession of Otteford, but was commanded by the archbishop to return it to Canterbury in 830. It remained so until 1070.

The chronicler monk John of Worcester told that Edmund Ironside brought his army to Kent, and fought the Danes at the Battle of Otford in 1016. The Danes apparently fled to Sheppey.

===Norman===
Otford is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it shows that the Archbishop of Canterbury possessed 8 mills in the village, which is referred to as &quot;Otefort&quot;.

&quot;The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 3&quot; notes that the Textus Roffensis or &quot;Tome of Rochester&quot;, published between 1122 and 1124, uses &quot;Otteford&quot; as the name.

The Gough Map of Great Britain, dated between 1355 and 1366, shows Otford labelled with its current name, but on King Henry VIII&#x27;s map Angliae Figura, the village is known as &quot;Otforde&quot;.

===Middle Ages===
In 1514, Archbishop William Warham replaced an existing ecclesiastical building with Otford Palace, and in 1519, King Henry VIII stayed in the palace. Apparently, he liked it so much, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer felt compelled to give it to the king in 1537.

===Late Middle Ages===
&quot;The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent&quot; says that: &quot;Otford Parish is about nine miles in circumference, and contains about two thousand four hundred acres of land, of which about seventy are woodland. It lies for the greatest part of it in a low damp situation, which makes it far from being pleasant, and gives it a lonely and gloomy appearance, and in all probability it would have been but little known had it not been for the residence of the archbishops at it for such a length of time.&quot;

===Victorian===
During the 19th century, Otford was still part of the Hundred of Codsheath, albeit with a population of 798 in 1841. In 1887, the Scottish theologian and historian John Hunt was appointed Vicar of St Bartholomew’s Anglican church.

In 1882, Otford Station (see &quot;Railway&quot;, below) opened for passenger traffic towards London and Sevenoaks.

===20th-century===

Otford included the settlement of Dunton Green until 1909, when it was split off into a separate parish. In 1924, the Otford Watermill, dating from 1541, burnt down.
In the late 1940s, Otford Medical Practice was formed and is now located at Lennards Avenue. On 16 January 1975 the village pond was granted listed building status. In 1999, Otford Medical Practice extended its reach to include a new branch surgery in Kemsing.

===Recent history===
In 2002, Otford won the Kent Village of the Year competition; the results were broadcast live on BBC Radio Kent, and reported in the &quot;Kent Messenger&quot; newspaper.

The census of 2011 lists Otford and Shoreham as having 4,595 residents (cf 798 in 1841, see above), in 1,852 households. The area is given as 2,147 hectares (cf 2,400 acres in the 1797 survey). The population density is averaged at 2.1 per hectare (0.85 per acre); however, this is perhaps misleading, as most housing is clustered.

In 2012, Otford was formally twinned with Neufchâtel-Hardelot, under a Twinning Charter signed in Neufchâtel-Hardelot on 17 September 2011 and Otford on 31 March 2012.

The pond one-way system was declared Roundabout of the Year by the Roundabout Appreciation Society in 2013.

In 2013 and 2014, Otford suffered considerable flooding from the river Darent. An assessment in 2011 by KCC highlighted significant risk for Otford. The risks were not overstated, with some shops out of business for several months.

==Skyline==
Notable landmarks are the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace, the duck-pond one-way system and the model of the Solar System, at a scale of 1:4,595,700,000, or just under from the Sun to Pluto when Pluto is at its perihelion. The Anglican parish church of Otford is dedicated to Saint Bartholomew. Otford Methodist Church, Otford Evangelical Free Church and the Roman Catholic Church of the Most Holy Trinity also serve the village; the buildings were registered for marriages in 1936, 1959 and 1981 respectively.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Otford station is located in the village and has services northbound to central London via Bromley South to Victoria, Blackfriars and St Pancras and southbound to Ashford International via Maidstone East and to Sevenoaks. Otford is served by two railway companies, Southeastern and Thameslink Railway. The railway station has a substantial, chargeable, car park. Some parts of north western Otford are closer to Dunton Green station, which has services northbound to Charing Cross and Cannon Street as well as to Sevenoaks. This railway station also has a chargeable car park.

===Road===
Otford lies on the A225, a main road between Dartford and Sevenoaks. The presence of the site of a Roman Villa, in addition to the remains of an ancient trackway, suggests that this road has a long history. The High Street, C296, forms a junction with the A225 at the one-way system which encloses the pond. The M26 Wrotham Spur uses the valley here as part of its route, closely following the boundary between Otford and Dunton Green. M25 access from Otford is effected most easily via the A25 into Sevenoaks and M25 Junction 15, Chevening Interchange.

===Buses===
*2 to Swanley via Shoreham, Eynsford &amp; Farningham or to Sevenoaks. Two journeys a day in each direction, Mondays to Saturdays only. Operated by Go-Coach.

===Footpaths===
The village is a key stopping-off point on the North Downs Way which runs through the village as it crosses the Darent Valley, intersecting the Darent Valley Path.

===Pilgrims&#x27; Way===
Passing through Otford is the Pilgrims&#x27; Way, the historic route supposed to have been taken by pilgrims from Winchester in Hampshire to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral.

==Amenities==
===Schools===
The village includes a state primary school, Otford Primary School, and two independents (properly called public schools in the UK), St Michael&#x27;s Prep School and Russell House School.

===Nursery schools===
There are three nursery schools in Otford: Otford Nursery, Gatehouse Nursery and Longacre.

===Sports===
Otford has a public recreation field of approximately 12 acres, marked for football with floodlighting, and cricket. There are also tennis courts available through Otford Tennis Club.

===Village hall===
Otford Village Memorial Hall is available for hire, and also regularly hosts local clubs ranging from dance to theatre, and bridge to embroidery.

===Otford Heritage Centre===
Built in 1999, in the old school house, this centre includes a scale model of the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace, and details of local geology, archaeology and history, plus artefacts from Roman to recent times, including historical photos, a Percy Pilcher model, and a working model of a Kentish oast house. Percy Pilcher is often quoted as being the first man to fly a glider in the British Isles, on 12 September 1895 (although there are good records showing that Eilmer of Malmsbury actually accomplished this in the 11th century). He is considered to have invented the bi-plane form of stacked wings. He was killed in a gliding accident before he could go on to be the first man to fly a powered aircraft.

===Shopping, eating and drinking===

Otford now has just two pubs, a restaurant and two cafes, as the conversion of retail premises into accommodation continues. It also has a couple of antique shops, a milliner, flower shop, a tennis specialist, local Post Office, a convenience store and a popular builder&#x27;s merchant. There is parking for free for a limited period in the village car-park.

===Leisure===
The village has allotments for hire, on land very close to the centre, which are managed by the Parish Council. Otford is covered by OS Landranger Map 188 (Maidstone and Royal Tunbridge Wells) at 1:50,000 and by OS Explorer 147 (Sevenoaks and Tonbridge) at 1:25,000.

Otford has its own television relay, situated at 51.321,0.199 or 51°19&#x27;16&quot;N 0°11&#x27;55&quot;E in the Otford Hills, serving Otford, Shoreham, and parts of Dunton Green and Kemsing. The television service is BBC London region, originating from the Crystal Palace transmitter. In some parts of Otford, the Crystal Palace transmitter can be received directly, and offers a richer set of multiplexes than the local relay. The BBC South East service is also available from the Bluebell Hill transmitter in some parts of Otford, which offers a similarly rich set of multiplexes but includes ITV Meridian not ITV London, and BBC Radio Kent rather than BBC London. Specialist installations can receive both sets at the same premises, as the multiplex channels are largely not overlapping, although two antennae are required for this.

The library is situated on the High Street, and is run by KCC. It is open Tuesdays and Fridays all day, Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays mornings only, and is closed on Wednesday and Sunday. It is integrated into the Kent library systems, with common library cards. Printing, scanning and copying services are available, as well as computers for web access, several social clubs and a book club. There is limited parking.

==Conservation areas==
Otford Conservation Area covers some 16 hectares and contains about forty listed buildings and part of the scheduled monument of the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace. It was designated in 1969 and extended in 1976, 1990 and 2006.

==Crime rate==
Reported crimes over the 12-month period May 2017 to April 2018 have occurred at a frequency of approximately 30 per month in the Otford and Shoreham areas. This is broadly similar to the rates across similar locations in Kent.

<doc id="382693" wikidata="Q7028596" url="?curid=382693" title="Nicky Gavron">
<text>Felicia Nicolette Gavron (&quot;née&quot; Coates, 24 November 1941 – 30 August 2024) was a British politician who was deputy mayor of London under Ken Livingstone from 2000 to 2003 and 2004 to 2008. She was a member of the London Assembly from 2000 to 2021 and was the former Labour candidate for the 2004 London mayoral election.

== Early life and education ==
Gavron was born in Worcester on 24 November 1941, the daughter of a German Jew who had fled from Nazi Germany in 1936. In March 2008, she claimed that her mother had been chosen to dance before Hitler in the opening ceremony of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, until the authorities discovered that she was Jewish.

She studied at Worcester Girls&#x27; Grammar School, then went on to study art history at the Courtauld Institute in London. She then gained a job as a lecturer at the Camberwell School of Art in South London.

== Political career ==
Gavron became involved in politics in the 1970s when she campaigned against the widening of the Archway Road in London. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; she said, &quot;It was in the days when everyone thought road widening was the answer, but the penny dropped for me that it was part of the problem.&quot;

In 1986, following the abolition of the Greater London Council, she was elected as a Labour councillor for Archway ward in the London Borough of Haringey. She was the leader of the London Planning Advisory Committee from 1994 until it was absorbed into the Greater London Authority. She was elected London Assembly member for Enfield and Haringey in the 2000 London Assembly election and was deputy mayor of London from May 2000 until June 2003, when the mayor, Ken Livingstone, appointed Jenny Jones of the Green Party to succeed her.

Although she was selected as Labour&#x27;s mayoral candidate for the 2004 elections, she stepped aside when Livingstone was readmitted to the party. In the 2004 London Assembly election she was re-elected as a London-wide Labour Assembly member on the party list. Shortly after the election, Livingstone once again appointed her to the position of deputy mayor. She was supposed to take up a position as acting mayor during Livingstone&#x27;s suspension for four weeks from 1 March 2006, but a High Court order froze the suspension, allowing him to remain in office.

Gavron stood for the Barnet and Camden London Assembly seat in the 2008 GLA elections against the Conservative incumbent, Brian Coleman. Although she was unsuccessful in this contest she increased the Labour share of the vote in the constituency and was also re-elected to the Assembly on the London-wide list vote.

Gavron ceased to be deputy mayor on 4 May 2008 following Boris Johnson&#x27;s victory in the 2008 London mayoral election. She was subsequently the chair of the London Assembly&#x27;s housing and planning committee and a deputy chair of the planning committee. She was also the London Assembly Labour Group&#x27;s lead spokesperson on planning matters.

Gavron was a onetime member of the Safer London Committee and the Metropolitan Police Authority. She was a member of the Mayor&#x27;s Advisory Cabinet, holding the portfolio for spatial development and strategic planning. In this capacity, she was the driving force behind much of the mayor&#x27;s environment and planning policy, overseeing the London Plan.

In January 2019, Gavron announced her intention to stand down at the 2020 London Assembly election.

Gavron was internationally recognised for her environmental expertise. She was a key figure in the establishment of the London Climate Change Agency and the C40 – a worldwide climate change action group made up of the world&#x27;s largest cities. In 2006, &quot;Business Week Magazine&quot; cited her, along with Ken Livingstone, as one of the 20 most important people in the world in the battle against greenhouse gas emissions. The magazine said, &quot;[She aims] to turn London into a model of a sustainable future for all the world&#x27;s great cities.&quot;

In the same year she called for a new Clean Air Act – a Low Carbon Act to fight climate change. She envisioned low carbon zones being rolled out across the country in the same way that smokeless zones had been in the 1950s.

Gavron criticised patio heaters, calling them &quot;an indulgence too far&quot;. In an article for the &quot;Guardian&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Comment is Free&quot; section she asked, &quot;Why not wear a jumper and enjoy fresh air, not a cocktail of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and goodness knows what else.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
In 1967, she married the publishing tycoon Robert Gavron (later Lord Gavron), a widower with two children. They had two daughters together, Jessica, now a lawyer, and Sarah, a film director. They divorced in 1987 and he died in 2015.

Gavron died at her home on 30 August 2024, at the age of 82.

<text>In mathematics, a congruence subgroup of a matrix group with integer entries is a subgroup defined by congruence conditions on the entries. A very simple example is the subgroup of invertible integer matrices of determinant 1 in which the off-diagonal entries are even. More generally, the notion of congruence subgroup can be defined for arithmetic subgroups of algebraic groups; that is, those for which we have a notion of &#x27;integral structure&#x27; and can define reduction maps modulo an integer.

The existence of congruence subgroups in an arithmetic group provides it with a wealth of subgroups, in particular it shows that the group is residually finite. An important question regarding the algebraic structure of arithmetic groups is the congruence subgroup problem, which asks whether all subgroups of finite index are essentially congruence subgroups.

Congruence subgroups of matrices are fundamental objects in the classical theory of modular forms; the modern theory of automorphic forms makes a similar use of congruence subgroups in more general arithmetic groups.

== Congruence subgroups of the modular group ==

The simplest interesting setting in which congruence subgroups can be studied is that of the modular group .

=== Principal congruence subgroups ===

If formula_1 is an integer there is a homomorphism formula_2 induced by the reduction modulo formula_3 morphism . The &quot;principal congruence subgroup of level formula_3&quot; in formula_5 is the kernel of , and it is usually denoted . Explicitly it is described as follows:
: formula_6

This definition immediately implies that formula_7 is a normal subgroup of finite index in . The strong approximation theorem (in this case an easy consequence of the Chinese remainder theorem) implies that formula_8 is surjective, so that the quotient formula_9 is isomorphic to . Computing the order of this finite group yields the following formula for the index:
: formula_10
where the product is taken over all prime numbers dividing .

If formula_11 then the restriction of formula_8 to any finite subgroup of formula_13 is injective. This implies the following result: 
: &quot;If formula_14 then the principal congruence subgroups formula_7 are torsion-free.&quot;
The group formula_16 contains formula_17 and is not torsion-free. On the other hand, its image in formula_18 is torsion-free, and the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by this subgroup is a sphere with three cusps.

=== Definition of a congruence subgroup ===

A subgroup formula_19 in formula_5 is called a &quot;congruence subgroup&quot; if there exists formula_1 such that formula_19 contains the principal congruence subgroup . The &quot;level&quot; formula_23 of formula_19 is then the smallest such .

From this definition it follows that:
* Congruence subgroups are of finite index in ; 
* The congruence subgroups of level formula_25 are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of .

=== Examples ===

The subgroup , sometimes called the &quot;Hecke congruence subgroup&quot; of level , is defined as the preimage by formula_8 of the group of upper triangular matrices. That is,
: formula_27

The index is given by the formula:
: formula_28
where the product is taken over all prime numbers dividing . If formula_29 is prime then formula_30 is in natural bijection with the projective line over the finite field , and explicit representatives for the (left or right) cosets of formula_31 in formula_13 are the following matrices:
: formula_33

The subgroups formula_34 are never torsion-free as they always contain the matrix . There are infinitely many formula_35 such that the image of formula_34 in formula_37 also contains torsion elements.

The subgroup formula_38 is the preimage of the subgroup of unipotent matrices:
: formula_39

Their indices are given by the formula:
: formula_40

The &quot;theta subgroup&quot; formula_41 is the congruence subgroup of formula_13 defined as the preimage of the cyclic group of order two generated by formula_43. It is of index 3 and is explicitly described by:
: formula_44

These subgroups satisfy the following inclusions: , as well as .

=== Properties of congruence subgroups ===

The congruence subgroups of the modular group and the associated Riemann surfaces are distinguished by some particularly nice geometric and topological properties. Here is a sample:
* There are only finitely many congruence covers of the modular surface that have genus zero; 
* (Selberg&#x27;s 3/16 theorem) If formula_45 is a nonconstant eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a congruence cover of the modular surface with eigenvalue formula_46 then .

There is also a collection of distinguished operators called Hecke operators on smooth functions on congruence covers, which commute with each other and with the Laplace–Beltrami operator and are diagonalisable in each eigenspace of the latter. Their common eigenfunctions are a fundamental example of automorphic forms. Other automorphic forms associated to these congruence subgroups are the holomorphic modular forms, which can be interpreted as cohomology classes on the associated Riemann surfaces via the Eichler-Shimura isomorphism.

=== Normalisers of Hecke congruence subgroups ===

The normalizer formula_47 of formula_31 in formula_49 has been investigated; one result from the 1970s, due to Jean-Pierre Serre, Andrew Ogg and John G. Thompson is that the corresponding modular curve (the Riemann surface resulting from taking the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by ) has genus zero (i.e., the modular curve is a Riemann sphere) if and only if is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, or 71. When Ogg later heard about the monster group, he noticed that these were precisely the prime factors of the size of , he wrote up a paper offering a bottle of Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey to anyone who could explain this fact – this was a starting point for the theory of monstrous moonshine, which explains deep connections between modular function theory and the monster group.

== In arithmetic groups ==

=== Arithmetic groups ===
The notion of an arithmetic group is a vast generalisation based upon the fundamental example of . In general, to give a definition one needs a semisimple algebraic group formula_50 defined over formula_51 and a faithful representation , also defined over , from formula_50 into ; then an arithmetic group in formula_53 is any group formula_54 that is of finite index in the stabiliser of a finite-index sub-lattice in .

=== Congruence subgroups ===

Let formula_13 be an arithmetic group: for simplicity it is better to suppose that . As in the case of formula_56 there are reduction morphisms . We can define a principal congruence subgroup of formula_13 to be the kernel of formula_8 (which may a priori depend on the representation ), and a &quot;congruence subgroup&quot; of formula_13 to be any subgroup that contains a principal congruence subgroup (a notion that does not depend on a representation). They are subgroups of finite index that correspond to the subgroups of the finite groups , and the level is defined.

=== Examples ===

The principal congruence subgroups of formula_60 are the subgroups formula_7 given by:
: formula_62
the congruence subgroups then correspond to the subgroups of formula_63.

Another example of arithmetic group is given by the groups formula_64 where formula_65 is the ring of integers in a number field, for example . Then if formula_66 is a prime ideal dividing a rational prime formula_29 the subgroups formula_68 that is the kernel of the reduction map mod formula_66 is a congruence subgroup since it contains the principal congruence subgroup defined by reduction modulo .

Yet another arithmetic group is the Siegel modular groups , defined by:
: formula_70

Note that if formula_71 then . The &quot;theta subgroup&quot; formula_72 of formula_73 is the set of all formula_74 such that both formula_75 and formula_76 have even diagonal entries.

=== Property (τ) ===

The family of congruence subgroups in a given arithmetic group formula_13 always has property (τ) of Lubotzky–Zimmer. This can be taken to mean that the Cheeger constant of the family of their Schreier coset graphs (with respect to a fixed generating set for ) is uniformly bounded away from zero, in other words they are a family of expander graphs. There is also a representation-theoretical interpretation: if formula_13 is a lattice in a Lie group then property (τ) is equivalent to the non-trivial unitary representations of occurring in the spaces formula_79 being bounded away from the trivial representation (in the Fell topology on the unitary dual of ). Property (τ) is a weakening of Kazhdan&#x27;s property (T) which implies that the family of all finite-index subgroups has property (τ).

=== In &quot;S&quot;-arithmetic groups ===

If formula_50 is a formula_81-group and formula_82 is a finite set of primes, an formula_83-arithmetic subgroup of formula_84 is defined as an arithmetic subgroup but using formula_85 instead of . The fundamental example is .

Let formula_86 be an formula_83-arithmetic group in an algebraic group . If formula_3 is an integer not divisible by any prime in , then all primes formula_89 are invertible modulo formula_3 and it follows that there is a morphism . Thus it is possible to define congruence subgroups in , whose level is always coprime to all primes in .

== The congruence subgroup problem ==

=== Finite-index subgroups in SL2(Z) ===

Congruence subgroups in formula_5 are finite-index subgroups: it is natural to ask whether they account for all finite-index subgroups in . The answer is a resounding &quot;no&quot;. This fact was already known to Felix Klein and there are many ways to exhibit many non-congruence finite-index subgroups. For example: 
#The simple group in the composition series of a quotient , where formula_92 is a normal congruence subgroup, must be a simple group of Lie type (or cyclic), in fact one of the groups formula_93 for a prime . But for every formula_94 there are finite-index subgroups formula_95 such that formula_96 is isomorphic to the alternating group formula_97 (for example formula_16 surjects on any group with two generators, in particular on all alternating groups, and the kernels of these morphisms give an example). These groups thus must be non-congruence. 
#There is a surjection ; for formula_94 large enough the kernel of formula_100 must be non-congruence (one way to see this is that the Cheeger constant of the Schreier graph goes to 0; there is also a simple algebraic proof in the spirit of the previous item). 
#The number formula_101 of congruence subgroups in formula_13 of index formula_103 satisfies . On the other hand, the number formula_104 of finite index subgroups of index formula_103 in formula_13 satisfies , so most subgroups of finite index must be non-congruence.

=== Congruence kernel ===

One can ask the same question for any arithmetic group as for the modular group:
: Naïve congruence subgroup problem: &quot;Given an arithmetic group, are all of its finite-index subgroups congruence subgroups? &quot;

This problem can have a positive solution: its origin is in the work of Hyman Bass, Jean-Pierre Serre and John Milnor, and Jens Mennicke who proved that, in contrast to the case of formula_56, when formula_11 all finite-index subgroups in formula_109 are congruence subgroups. The solution by Bass–Milnor–Serre involved an aspect of algebraic number theory linked to K-theory. On the other hand, the work of Serre on formula_110 over number fields shows that in some cases the answer to the naïve question is &quot;no&quot; while a slight relaxation of the problem has a positive answer.

This new problem is better stated in terms of certain compact topological groups associated to an arithmetic group . There is a topology on formula_13 for which a base of neighbourhoods of the trivial subgroup is the set of subgroups of finite index (the &quot;profinite topology&quot;); and there is another topology defined in the same way using only congruence subgroups. The profinite topology gives rise to a completion of , while the &quot;congruence&quot; topology gives rise to another completion . Both are profinite groups and there is a natural surjective morphism formula_112 (intuitively, there are fewer conditions for a Cauchy sequence to comply with in the congruence topology than in the profinite topology). The &quot;congruence kernel&quot; formula_113 is the kernel of this morphism, and the congruence subgroup problem stated above amounts to whether formula_113 is trivial. The weakening of the conclusion then leads to the following problem.

: Congruence subgroup problem: &quot;Is the congruence kernel formula_113 finite?&quot;

When the problem has a positive solution one says that formula_13 has the &quot;congruence subgroup property&quot;. A conjecture generally attributed to Serre states that an irreducible arithmetic lattice in a semisimple Lie group formula_117 has the congruence subgroup property if and only if the real rank of formula_117 is at least 2; for example, lattices in formula_119 should always have the property.

=== Negative solutions ===

Serre&#x27;s conjecture states that a lattice in a Lie group of rank one should not have the congruence subgroup property. There are three families of such groups: the orthogonal groups , the unitary groups formula_120 and the groups formula_121 (the isometry groups of a sesquilinear form over the Hamilton quaternions), plus the exceptional group formula_122 (see List of simple Lie groups). The current status of the congruence subgroup problem is as follows:
* It is known to have a negative solution (confirming the conjecture) for all groups formula_123 with . The proof uses the same argument as 2. in the case of formula_56: in the general case it is much harder to construct a surjection to , the proof is not at all uniform for all cases and fails for some lattices in dimension 7 due to the phenomenon of triality. In dimensions 2 and 3 and for some lattices in higher dimensions argument 1 and 3 also apply.
* It is known for many lattices in formula_125, but not all (again using a generalisation of argument 2).
* It is completely open in all remaining cases.

=== Positive solutions ===

In many situations where the congruence subgroup problem is expected to have a positive solution it has been proven that this is indeed the case. Here is a list of algebraic groups such that the congruence subgroup property is known to hold for the associated arithmetic lattices, in case the rank of the associated Lie group (or more generally the sum of the rank of the real and -adic factors in the case of -arithmetic groups) is at least 2: 
* Any non-anisotropic group (this includes the cases dealt with by Bass–Milnor–Serre, as well as formula_126 is , and many others); 
* Any group of type not formula_127 (for example all anisotropic forms of symplectic or orthogonal groups of real rank ); 
* Unitary groups of hermitian forms.

The cases of inner and outer forms of type formula_127 are still open. The algebraic groups in the case of inner forms of type formula_127 are those associated to the unit groups in central simple division algebras; for example the congruence subgroup property is not known for lattices in formula_119 or formula_131 with compact quotient.

== Congruence groups and adèle groups ==

The ring of adeles formula_132 is the restricted product of all completions of , i.e.
: formula_133
where the product is over the set formula_134 of all primes, formula_135 is the field of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers and an element formula_136 belongs to the restricted product if and only if for almost all primes , formula_137 belongs to the subring formula_138 of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers. 

Given any algebraic group formula_50 over formula_81 the adelic algebraic group formula_141 is well-defined. It can be endowed with a canonical topology, which in the case where formula_50 is a linear algebraic group is the topology as a subset of . The finite adèles formula_143 are the restricted product of all non-archimedean completions (all &quot;p&quot;-adic fields).

If formula_144 is an arithmetic group then its congruence subgroups are characterised by the following property: formula_145 is a congruence subgroup if and only if its closure formula_146 is a compact-open subgroup (compactness is automatic) and . In general the group formula_147 is equal to the congruence closure of formula_19 in , and the congruence topology on formula_13 is the induced topology as a subgroup of , in particular the congruence completion formula_150 is its closure in that group. These remarks are also valid for -arithmetic subgroups, replacing the ring of finite adèles with the restricted product over all primes not in .

More generally one can define what it means for a subgroup formula_54 to be a congruence subgroup without explicit reference to a fixed arithmetic subgroup, by asking that it be equal to its congruence closure . Thus it becomes possible to study all congruence subgroups at once by looking at the discrete subgroup . This is especially convenient in the theory of automorphic forms: for example all modern treatments of the Arthur–Selberg trace formula are done in this adélic setting.

<text>Adele (also spelled Adèle) is a feminine given name meaning &#x27;nobility&#x27;. It derives from German &quot;Adel&quot; meaning &#x27;nobility&#x27; or &quot;adal&quot;, &#x27;noble&#x27;. In Italy its name day is 24 December in honor of Adela of Pfalzel.

Its male form is the Germanic given name Adel.

The name, also spelled Adel, is also in use in Israel, where it stands for the Hebrew phrase &quot;esh dat lamo (אש דת למו)&quot; or &quot;a fiery law unto them&quot;, used in reference to the Torah.

<text>Newport is an unincorporated community in Monroe County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Berlin Charter Township. As an unincorporated community, Newport has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own but does have its own post office with the 48166 ZIP Code.

==Geography==

Newport sits at an elevation of above sea level. The community is centered along Swan Creek Road just east of Interstate 75, and Newport is accessible via exit 21 (Swan Creek Road). Interstate 275 has its southern terminus to the southwest and runs just to the west of the community.

The community is located about north of the city of Monroe in the northeast portion of Monroe County. Other nearby communities include the village of Estral Beach to the east, South Rockwood to the northeast, and Carleton to the northwest. The unincorporated community of Oldport is located to the east along Swan Creek Road at the intersection with North Dixie Highway. While Oldport itself is recognized by the GNIS as a distinct location, the entire area is now generally referred to as Newport. Swan Creek runs though the center of the community and flows for about to the east into Lake Erie. Its tributary, Little Swan Creek, runs just south of the community. Yoas Drain also drains into Swan Creek near the center of the community.

The current Newport post office is located at 8463 Swan Creek Road. The post office uses the 48166 ZIP Code, which serves a much larger area that includes the southern portion of Berlin Charter Township, as well as the northeastern portion of Frenchtown Charter Township and a very small southeastern portion of Ash Township. The census-designated place of Stony Point and the village of Estral Beach also use the 48166 ZIP Code, as does the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, Potter Cemetery, and portions of the Pointe Mouillee State Game Area.

Newport is served mostly by Airport Community Schools to the northeast, while residents in the southwestern portion of the community may attend Jefferson Schools.

==History==
Newport was first settled in the Michigan Territory as early as 1830 by the French, who named it Rivière aux Signes (Swan Creek). By 1836, several sawmills were built along the creek, and the name Newport came about due to its location near Lake Erie. In 1837 after the territory received statehood, the community became part of the newly organized Ash Township. In 1867, the eastern portion of Ash Township and Newport were reorganized into Berlin Township.

Newport is the location of St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church, which was established in 1882 from an earlier church mission that was formed as early as 1838. The current church is located at 8125 Swan Creek Road at the intersection with North Dixie Highway. St. Charles Cemetery is located in Newport, and it consists of two separate cemeteries. The &quot;old&quot; St. Charles Cemetery was established in 1851, although it contains a grave dating back to 1802. This small cemetery is no longer active, while the current St. Charles Cemetery is located slightly north along North Dixie Highway.

The community of Newport received its first post office on August 16, 1836. The post office was discontinued on July 1, 1841 but reestablished soon after on August 16, 1842. The current Newport post office was opened on January 15, 1904 and remains in operation. In the early 1970s, the post office became a branch of the Monroe postal service.

Newport once contained its own railroad station. The station was used by Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, Michigan Central Railroad, and Detroit and Toledo Shore Line Railroad. While Newport no longer contains an active station, there are two railroad lines that run through the community: a single line operated by Norfolk Southern Railway and a dual line operated by Canadian National Railway. The original station was moved and restored, and it is currently used as educational building for the nearby Newport Community Church.

<text>Israel Weapon Industries (IWI), formerly the Magen division of the Israel Military Industries Ltd. (IMI), is an Israeli firearms manufacturer.

It was founded in 1933. Formerly owned by the State of Israel, the Small Arms Division of IMI was privatized and renamed IWI in 2005.

IWI is one of the world&#x27;s most famous and bestselling military arms manufacturers. 
The Magen division rose to international prominence in the 1950s, as the creator of the Uzi, of which over 10 million would be produced, netting billions of dollars for the company. Subsequent well known military exports have included the Jericho 941 semi-automatic pistol, Negev light machine gun, Galil assault rifle, Tavor assault rifle, and the DAN .338 sniper rifle.

IWI develops and manufactures guns used by armies and law enforcement agencies around the world.

== Manufacturing ==
=== Ramat HaSharon === 
For many decades, IWI and the Magen division of Israeli Military Industries before it, has manufactured its weapons in Ramat HaSharon. The factory has for many years been regarded an important component of the manufacturing sector in Ramat HaSharon. In 2017, IWI announced it is planning to construct a new factory in Kiryat Gat, to which its manufacturing will re-locate when completed in 2020. The new Kiryat Gat factory, whose construction will cost NIS 180 million, will employ 560 full-time production workers and engineers on its assembly lines.

=== Overseas ===
====India====
IWI owns several factories overseas, for the manufacture of weapons for local markets. In India, IWI is establishing a joint-manufacturing center with Punj Lloyd (with IWI owning 49% of the plant, and Punj Lloyd owning 51% of the plant), which will be India&#x27;s first privately-owned small-arms manufacturing plant. The factory will manufacture firearms for the Indian army. IWI said in 2017, that it expects tenders with the Indian army in the region of $200–300 million.

====USA====
IWI also operates a manufacturing facility in Middletown, Pennsylvania USA. They locally assemble the Zion-15, Tavor and Galil rifles, TS12 15+1 round semi-automatic shotgun as well as the Jericho, Masada and Galil pistols, among others.

<doc id="382707" wikidata="Q601956" url="?curid=382707" title="Aalborg University">
<text>Aalborg University (AAU) is an international public university with campuses in Aalborg, Esbjerg, and Copenhagen, Denmark. Founded in 1974, the university awards bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, and PhD degrees in a wide variety of subjects within humanities, social sciences, information technology, design, engineering, exact sciences, and medicine. The motto of the university in Danish is (on new paths).

== History ==
The movement for a university in the North Jutland Region started in 1961 when the North Jutland Committee for higher education institutions was established. On 19 August 1969 the Aalborg University Association was founded and a planning group was established with Eigil Hastrup as chairman. The same year in December, about 1,000 people from North Jutland demonstrated in front of the Folketinget (the Danish Parliament) for their cause.

In 1970, the law for the establishment of a university centre in Aalborg was passed in the Danish Parliament. In 1972, it was decided that the first rector of the new university center should be the Swedish historian and professor Jörgen Weibull. On 1 September 1974, Aalborg University Center (AUC) was inaugurated by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. Jørgen Weibull was replaced by Sven Caspersen as rector of Aalborg University Center (AUC) in 1976. At the same time, a new management organization was established under a consistory. The first formal cooperation agreement was signed with the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay in 1980. The North Jutland knowledge park was established in 1989 as a neighbor to Aalborg University Center (AUC).

In 1993, external representatives joined the consistory. In 1994, Aalborg University Center (AUC) changed its name to Aalborg University (AAU). Aalborg University - Esbjerg was established through a merger between the engineering college in Esbjerg and Aalborg University in 1995. In 1998, the NOVI science park was connected to Aalborg University. Aalborg University Copenhagen was formed in collaboration with the engineering college in Copenhagen in 2003. A new university board was formed and joined by its members on 1 February 2004, with Jørgen Østergaard appointed as rector. In 2005, Finn Kjærsdam was hired by the university board as rector. Aalborg University and the Danish Building Research Institute merged in 2007. In 2010, Aalborg University established a faculty of Medicine and created a medical education. Per Michael Johansen was hired as rector by the university board in 2014.

== List of rectors ==
Since Aalborg University&#x27;s foundation in 1974, the university has had a total of five rectors in office.

== Profile ==
Aalborg University differentiates itself from the older and more traditional Danish universities with its focus on interdisciplinary, inter-faculty studies; an experimental curriculum based on an interdisciplinary basic course with subsequent specialisation; a pedagogical structure based on problem-centred, real-life projects of educational and research relevance – which internationally has become known and recognised as &quot;The Aalborg Model&quot;. With the problem-based, project-organised model, semesters at AAU are centred around complex real-life problems which students attempt to find answers to in a scientific manner while working together in groups. In February 2007, the foundation of the UICEE Centre for Problem Based Learning (UCPBL) paid recognition to Aalborg University, which subsequently led to the appointment of AAU as UNESCO Chair in problem-based learning.

== University rankings ==

According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s 2021 ranking, Aalborg University (AAU) was ranked the eighth best university in the world and the best in Europe within mechanical engineering.

In a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study which analyzed the global state of art in the engineering education, Aalborg University (AAU) was named as the leading university in Europe in engineering education by 50 thought leaders from all over the world.

In 2021, Times Higher Education Impact Rankings ranked Aalborg University number 6 in the world, out of 1,117 universities from 94 countries/regions, according to the United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goals. That is the number 1 university in the European Union (EU). In 2022, Times Higher Education Impact Rankings ranked Aalborg University (AAU) as the best university in the world in Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) for the third year in a row.

For the academic year 2023, in overall terms, Aalborg University (AAU) has significantly dropped in worldwide university rankings, according to THE and QS. In addition, the Danish university dropped even more drastically in worldwide academic rankings during 2022 according to ARWU. In the 2024 QS top, Aalborg University (AAU) dropped to the 336th position.

== Administration and organisation ==
The university is governed by a board consisting of 11 members as follows:

* Six members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board;
* Two members are appointed by the scientific staff;
* One member is appointed by the administrative staff;
* Two members are appointed by the university students.

The rector is appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints deans, and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty are not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance.

==Campuses==
Aalborg University (AAU) has campuses in Aalborg, Esbjerg, and Copenhagen.

=== Esbjerg ===
Aalborg University Esbjerg (AAU-Esbjerg) is an organisational unit (department) under Aalborg University, but is geographically located in Esbjerg. The institute&#x27;s official name is &quot;Esbjerg Technical Institute&quot;, formerly the &quot;Department of Chemistry and Applied Engineering.&quot;

AAUE has approximately 500 students and educates mainly engineers, but also offers a number of niche programmes such as fishing technology and a graduate degree in computer science education (Bachelor of Science in software engineering).

Aalborg University Esbjerg was created through a merger of Engineering College Esbjerg and Aalborg University in 1995. Since the merger, the number of applicants for Aalborg University Esbjerg has risen steadily and therefore there have been a need for extensions of the physical environment in several stages.

The university offers programmes in information technology, with a Department of Software and Media Technology.

The student organisation at AAU-Esbjerg is called DSR-SE and the student bar is called &quot;The Loophole&quot; ().

== Faculties and departments ==
Aalborg University has five faculties with a number of departments:

* Faculty of Humanities

The main branch of the University Library is located at Kroghstræde 3 in Aalborg, which is linked to smaller branches located on other campuses in Aalborg, Esbjerg, and Copenhagen.

Aalborg University through Aalborg University Press is a publisher of wide range of journals, and among them four journals are listed in Scopus: International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management, Journal of Somaesthetics, Journal of China and International Relations and Academic quarter (Journal for humanistic research). Other journals are, for example, Journal of Business Models, Coaching Psychology - The Danish Journal of Coaching Psychology, Journal of Problem Based Learning in Higher Education, Globe: A Journal of Language, Culture and Communication, Music Therapy in Psychiatry Online.

Aalborg University Press was founded in 1978 and it focuses on political science, sociology, media and cultural studies. 
However, according to Scopus, the journal with highest score and number of citations is International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management, with focus on Energy System analysis, Economics, Socio economics and Feasibility studies as well as specific feasibility studies and analyses of the transition to sustainable energy systems.
All journals are Open Access and most of the journal content is peer-reviewed. Majority of authors are affiliated with Aalborg University (AU), but few of the authors are international scholars, since AU is an international orientated University.

== Special action areas and cross-disciplinary research ==
AAU conducts research within all faculties. Aalborg University is among the leading universities in the world within health technology research, wireless communication, energy, computer science, innovation economics and comparative welfare studies. AAU has established centres for telecommunication at Birla Institute of Technology in India, at Bandung Institute of Technology in Indonesia, and at the University of Rome. Furthermore, AAU has established a research centre for health technology at Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University in China.

AAU has conducted several experiments in the field of CubeSat technology. The first AAU CubeSat was launched on 30 June 2003, the second (called AAUSAT-II) on 28 April 2008 and the third will be launched in Q1, 2013. After launching AAUSAT3 the fourth will begin development.

AAU has always adopted a cross-disciplinary, problem-based approach to research which often requires contributions from a number of scientific disciplines. Aalborg University has five cross-disciplinary action areas:

* Sustainable energy, the environment and construction;
* Global production, innovation, knowledge development and coherence;
* Information technology;
* Nanotechnology and nanoproduction;
* Experience technology and design.

== Cooperative agreements with other universities and colleges ==
Aalborg University is a member of the European Consortium of Innovative Universities (ECIU), which was founded in 1997 by 10 European universities.

<doc id="382708" wikidata="Q3491998" url="?curid=382708" title="Cofiniteness">
<text>In mathematics, a cofinite subset of a set formula_1 is a subset formula_2 whose complement in formula_1 is a finite set. In other words, formula_2 contains all but finitely many elements of formula_5 If the complement is not finite, but is countable, then one says the set is cocountable.

These arise naturally when generalizing structures on finite sets to infinite sets, particularly on infinite products, as in the product topology or direct sum. 

This use of the prefix &quot;&#x27;&quot; to describe a property possessed by a set&#x27;s &#x27;mplement is consistent with its use in other terms such as &quot;[[Cofiniteness|]]meagre set&quot;. 

==Boolean algebras==

The set of all subsets of formula_1 that are either finite or cofinite forms a Boolean algebra, which means that it is closed under the operations of union, intersection, and complementation. This Boolean algebra is the on formula_5

In the other direction, a Boolean algebra formula_2 has a unique non-principal ultrafilter (that is, a maximal filter not generated by a single element of the algebra) if and only if there exists an infinite set formula_1 such that formula_2 is isomorphic to the finite–cofinite algebra on formula_5 In this case, the non-principal ultrafilter is the set of all cofinite subsets of formula_1.

==Cofinite topology==

The cofinite topology or the finite complement topology is a topology that can be defined on every set formula_5 It has precisely the empty set and all cofinite subsets of formula_1 as open sets. As a consequence, in the cofinite topology, the only closed subsets are finite sets, or the whole of formula_5 For this reason, the cofinite topology is also known as the finite-closed topology. Symbolically, one writes the topology as
formula_16

This topology occurs naturally in the context of the Zariski topology. Since polynomials in one variable over a field formula_17 are zero on finite sets, or the whole of formula_18 the Zariski topology on formula_17 (considered as &quot;affine line&quot;) is the cofinite topology. The same is true for any &quot;irreducible&quot; algebraic curve; it is not true, for example, for formula_20 in the plane.

===Properties===

* Subspaces: Every subspace topology of the cofinite topology is also a cofinite topology.
* Compactness: Since every open set contains all but finitely many points of formula_21 the space formula_1 is compact and sequentially compact.
* Separation: The cofinite topology is the coarsest topology satisfying the T1 axiom; that is, it is the smallest topology for which every singleton set is closed. In fact, an arbitrary topology on formula_1 satisfies the T1 axiom if and only if it contains the cofinite topology. If formula_1 is finite then the cofinite topology is simply the discrete topology. If formula_1 is not finite then this topology is not Hausdorff (T2), regular or normal because no two nonempty open sets are disjoint (that is, it is hyperconnected).

===Double-pointed cofinite topology===

The double-pointed cofinite topology is the cofinite topology with every point doubled; that is, it is the topological product of the cofinite topology with the indiscrete topology on a two-element set. It is not T0 or T1, since the points of each doublet are topologically indistinguishable. It is, however, R0 since topologically distinguishable points are separated. The space is compact as the product of two compact spaces; alternatively, it is compact because each nonempty open set contains all but finitely many points.

For an example of the countable double-pointed cofinite topology, the set formula_26 of integers can be given a topology such that every even number formula_27 is topologically indistinguishable from the following odd number formula_28. The closed sets are the unions of finitely many pairs formula_29 or the whole set. The open sets are the complements of the closed sets; namely, each open set consists of all but a finite number of pairs formula_29 or is the empty set.

==Other examples==

===Product topology===
The product topology on a product of topological spaces formula_31 has basis formula_32 where formula_33 is open, and cofinitely many formula_34

The analog without requiring that cofinitely many factors are the whole space is the box topology.

===Direct sum===
The elements of the direct sum of modules formula_35 are sequences formula_36 where cofinitely many formula_37

The analog without requiring that cofinitely many summands are zero is the direct product.

<text>Kouvola () is a city in Finland and the administrative capital of Kymenlaakso. It is located in the southeastern interior of the country. The population of Kouvola is approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the 17th most populous urban area in the country. 

Kouvola is located along the Kymijoki River in the region of Kymenlaakso, kilometers east of Lahti, west of Lappeenranta and northeast of the capital, Helsinki. With Kotka, Kouvola is one of the capital centers and is the largest city in the Kymenlaakso region.

The urban area of Kouvola in the city centre itself is home to about 47,000 people. The city covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . Kouvola is bordered by the municipalities of Hamina, Heinola, Iitti, Kotka, Lapinjärvi, Loviisa, Luumäki, Miehikkälä, Mäntyharju, Pyhtää and Savitaipale. Kouvola has over 450 lakes and, together with Mäntyharju, the Kouvola area includes the Repovesi National Park.

Kouvola, which had population growth as late as the 1980s, has suffered a loss of migration since the 1990s. Over time, the loss has only deepened, so that at the end of the 2010s Kouvola was Finland&#x27;s worst migration loss area. Natural demographics have also trended downward; in 2017, more than 450 more people died in the city than new ones were born. Currently, the population of Kouvola is decreasing annually by about 800 inhabitants. The reasons for the emigration are thought to be largely due to job losses in the region.

== History ==

The village of Kouvola has been inhabited since the Middle Ages, and it has belonged alternately to the churches of Hollola, Iitti and Valkeala. However, the actual development did not start until the 1870s when the Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg line was built and Kouvola became a railway junction. Kouvola railroad built Kymin mill founder Axel Wilhelm Wahren railway administration by on application, on the basis of the track engineers decided to recommend the creation of a fifth-end position in a half mile east of the variable alert Otava with acceptance on sandy soil on fabric. In the next decade, the Savonia railway was built from Kouvola to the north and the Kotka line to the south, resulting in Kouvola becoming one of the busiest railway junctions in Finland. Over time, Kouvola developed into an important pulp-producing, paper-milling and printing centre and even had a leading industrial engineering sector.

In 1918, conflict between the Red and White factions raged heavily during the Finnish Civil War. More than 200 people were killed in the area during the fighting.

As a result of the railway, Kouvola was heavily built. In 1922 it was separated from the municipality of Valkeala and gained commercial rights immediately the following year. The city of Kouvola was established in 1960. Kouvola was annexed to Viipuri Province in 1922–1945 but in 1940 and 1944, most of Viipuri County was ceded to the Soviet Union, and the remaining areas were formed into Kymi Province in 1945. Kouvola had also become an administrative center; As the capital of Kymen County, it operated from 1955 until the 1997 county reform.

In January 2009, the six municipalities of Kouvola, Kuusankoski, Elimäki, Anjalankoski, Valkeala and Jaala were consolidated, forming the new municipality of Kouvola. Kouvola has also assumed the slogan &quot;Kymijoen kaupunki&quot; (the town of Kymijoki) previously used by Anjalankoski.

== Culture ==
*The name itself derives from Old Finnish &quot;kouvo&quot;, meaning bear. The arms are &quot;Sable, an escarbuncle Or, base wavy Argent&quot;.
* Verla factory, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located near Kouvola.
* The newspapers &quot;Kouvolan Sanomat&quot; and &quot;Keskilaakso&quot; are published in Kouvola.
* The third biggest Amusement park in Finland, called Tykkimäki is located in Kouvola.

=== Province History of Kouvola ===
* Viipuri Province (1922–1945)
* Kymi Province (1945–1997)
* Southern Finland Province (1997–2009)
* Kymenlaakso (2009–)

== Sports ==
Kouvola is the hometown of the Sudet sports club, which became Finnish champions in bandy six consecutive times, and they have a football team which is playing at the fourth highest level, Kolmonen, despite Sudet being one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. KooKoo is the most successful ice hockey team in Kymenlaakso. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. Kouvolan Pallonlyöjät (KPL) is a baseball team based in Kouvola and known for Pesäpallo. KPL was won five Finnish championships and it plays in the Finnish top league, Superpesis. Kouvot is a basketball team based in Kouvola. the team plays in the highest level Korisliiga and has won four Finnish championships.

MyPa is one of the most successful football clubs in Finland and the 1990s was the golden era. MyPa is played 23 seasons in the Finnish top football league Veikkausliiga. MyPa are based in the industrial village of Myllykoski, part of the city of Kouvola. The club became inactive in professional football after having ceased operations in 2015 due to financial difficulties. In 2017, MyPa returned and started again from the fourth highest tier but has quickly risen to the second highest level, Ykkönen, where it is now playing.
Kouvola also has a Palomäki Ski Jump Center, very close to the city, where young people and other sports enthusiasts can go to jump on a ski jump.

== Climate ==
Kouvola has humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;).The city has four distinct seasons, the amount of precipitation is relatively uniform throughout the year. The driest season is spring. Summers are generally relatively warm as the city is considered to be one of the hottest cities in Finland as it has had the most days with &quot;helle&quot; (temperatures above ) since 2000. Winters are cold and long, colder than cities located in the coastal areas of Finland because of its location further inland, meaning the marine effect doesn&#x27;t affect the city as much than those nearer the sea and specially those nearer the southwestern coasts of the Finnish side of Gulf of Finland. This also means that the summers are warmer due to it being further inland as the sea effect is making the summer temperatures slightly cooler in coastal areas. The average annual temperature is . The highest ever recorded temperature in the station was , on July 28, 2010. The lowest ever recorded was . The city has a significant rainfall throughout the year and even in the driest month the precipitation stays over a month. The average duration of sunshine per year is 1,658 hours. 
Kouvola Utti airport weather station has on average somewhat lower average temperatures than in the city.

<text>Adamstown is the capital and only settlement of the Pitcairn Islands, the only British Overseas Territory that is located in the southern Pacific Ocean.

As of 2023, Adamstown has a population of 35, which is the entire population of the Pitcairn Islands. All the other islands in the group are uninhabited. Adamstown is where all residents live, while they grow food in other areas of the island.

Adamstown is the third smallest capital in the world by population. It has access to television, satellite Internet, and a telephone; however, the main means of communication remains ham radio. The &quot;Hill of Difficulty&quot; connects the island&#x27;s jetty to the town.

==History==

The history of the Pitcairn Islands begins with the settlement of the islands by Polynesians in the 11th century. The Polynesians established a culture that flourished for four centuries and then vanished. Pitcairn was settled again in 1790 by a group of British mutineers on HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; and Tahitians. Adamstown is named for the last surviving mutineer, John Adams.

==Geography==

The settlement is located on the central-north side of the island of Pitcairn, facing the Pacific Ocean and close to the Bounty Bay, the only seaport of the island.

===Climate===
Adamstown has a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification system. The hamlet features a wet, very warm climate averaging of rain a year. The wettest month is December and temperatures do not vary significantly throughout the year.

==Government==
The Present Committee on Geographic Names stated that Auckland, New Zealand is the administrative centre for these islands because the Governor of Pitcairn, the British High Commissioner to New Zealand, is based in Auckland. However the same cited document describes Adamstown as the capital of the BOT on the following page.

<text>Baraqiel (Imperial Aramaic: 𐡁𐡓𐡒𐡀𐡋; Aramaic: ברקאל; , Βαρακήλ), commonly spelt Baraqiel, was the 9th watcher of the 20 leaders of the 200 fallen angels that are mentioned in an ancient work called the Book of Enoch. The name means &quot;lightning of God&quot;, which is fitting since it has been said that Baraqiel taught men astrology during the days of Jared or Yered.

<doc id="382733" wikidata="Q1879333" url="?curid=382733" title="Birational geometry">
<text>In mathematics, birational geometry is a field of algebraic geometry in which the goal is to determine when two algebraic varieties are isomorphic outside lower-dimensional subsets. This amounts to studying mappings that are given by rational functions rather than polynomials; the map may fail to be defined where the rational functions have poles.

==Birational maps==

=== Rational maps ===
A rational map from one variety (understood to be irreducible) formula_1 to another variety formula_2, written as a dashed arrow , is defined as a morphism from a nonempty open subset formula_3 to formula_2. By definition of the Zariski topology used in algebraic geometry, a nonempty open subset formula_5 is always dense in formula_1, in fact the complement of a lower-dimensional subset. Concretely, a rational map can be written in coordinates using rational functions.

=== Birational maps ===
A birational map from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; is a rational map such that there is a rational map inverse to &quot;f&quot;. A birational map induces an isomorphism from a nonempty open subset of &quot;X&quot; to a nonempty open subset of &quot;Y&quot;, and vice versa: an isomorphism between nonempty open subsets of &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; by definition gives a birational map . In this case, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are said to be birational, or birationally equivalent. In algebraic terms, two varieties over a field &quot;k&quot; are birational if and only if their function fields are isomorphic as extension fields of &quot;k&quot;.

A special case is a birational morphism , meaning a morphism which is birational. That is, &quot;f&quot; is defined everywhere, but its inverse may not be. Typically, this happens because a birational morphism contracts some subvarieties of &quot;X&quot; to points in &quot;Y&quot;.

=== Birational equivalence and rationality ===
A variety &quot;X&quot; is said to be rational if it is birational to affine space (or equivalently, to projective space) of some dimension. Rationality is a very natural property: it means that &quot;X&quot; minus some lower-dimensional subset can be identified with affine space minus some lower-dimensional subset.

==== Birational equivalence of a plane conic ====
For example, the circle formula_1 with equation formula_8 in the affine plane is a rational curve, because there is a rational map given by
:formula_9
which has a rational inverse &quot;g&quot;: &quot;X&quot; ⇢ formula_10 given by
:formula_11
Applying the map &quot;f&quot; with &quot;t&quot; a rational number gives a systematic construction of Pythagorean triples.

The rational map formula_12 is not defined on the locus where formula_13. So, on the complex affine line formula_14, formula_12 is a morphism on the open subset formula_16, formula_17. Likewise, the rational map is not defined at the point (0,−1) in formula_1.

==== Birational equivalence of smooth quadrics and Pn ====
More generally, a smooth quadric (degree 2) hypersurface &quot;X&quot; of any dimension &quot;n&quot; is rational, by stereographic projection. (For &quot;X&quot; a quadric over a field &quot;k&quot;, &quot;X&quot; must be assumed to have a &quot;k&quot;-rational point; this is automatic if &quot;k&quot; is algebraically closed.) To define stereographic projection, let &quot;p&quot; be a point in &quot;X&quot;. Then a birational map from &quot;X&quot; to the projective space formula_19 of lines through &quot;p&quot; is given by sending a point &quot;q&quot; in &quot;X&quot; to the line through &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;. This is a birational equivalence but not an isomorphism of varieties, because it fails to be defined where (and the inverse map fails to be defined at those lines through &quot;p&quot; which are contained in &quot;X&quot;).

===== Birational equivalence of quadric surface =====
The Segre embedding gives an embedding formula_20 given by
:formula_21
The image is the quadric surface formula_22 in formula_23. That gives another proof that this quadric surface is rational, since formula_24 is obviously rational, having an open subset isomorphic to formula_25.

==Minimal models and resolution of singularities==
Every algebraic variety is birational to a projective variety (Chow&#x27;s lemma). So, for the purposes of birational classification, it is enough to work only with projective varieties, and this is usually the most convenient setting.

Much deeper is Hironaka&#x27;s 1964 theorem on resolution of singularities: over a field of characteristic 0 (such as the complex numbers), every variety is birational to a smooth projective variety. Given that, it is enough to classify smooth projective varieties up to birational equivalence.

In dimension 1, if two smooth projective curves are birational, then they are isomorphic. But that fails in dimension at least 2, by the blowing up construction. By blowing up, every smooth projective variety of dimension at least 2 is birational to infinitely many &quot;bigger&quot; varieties, for example with bigger Betti numbers.

This leads to the idea of minimal models: is there a unique simplest variety in each birational equivalence
class? The modern definition is that a projective variety &quot;X&quot; is minimal if the canonical line bundle &quot;KX&quot; has nonnegative degree on every curve in &quot;X&quot;; in other words, &quot;KX&quot; is nef. It is easy to check that blown-up varieties are never minimal.

This notion works perfectly for algebraic surfaces (varieties of dimension 2). In modern terms, one central result of the Italian school of algebraic geometry from 1890–1910, part of the classification of surfaces, is that every surface &quot;X&quot; is birational either to a product formula_26 for some curve &quot;C&quot; or to a minimal surface &quot;Y&quot;. The two cases are mutually exclusive, and &quot;Y&quot; is unique if it exists. When &quot;Y&quot; exists, it is called the minimal model of &quot;X&quot;.

==Birational invariants==

At first, it is not clear how to show that there are any algebraic varieties which are not rational. In order to prove this, some birational invariants of algebraic varieties are needed. A birational invariant is any kind of number, ring, etc which is the same, or isomorphic, for all varieties that are birationally equivalent.

=== Plurigenera ===
One useful set of birational invariants are the plurigenera. The canonical bundle of a smooth variety &quot;X&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; means the line bundle of &quot;n&quot;-forms , which is the &quot;n&quot;th exterior power of the cotangent bundle of &quot;X&quot;. For an integer &quot;d&quot;, the &quot;d&quot;th tensor power of &quot;KX&quot; is again a line bundle. For , the vector space of global sections has the remarkable property that a birational map between smooth projective varieties induces an isomorphism .

For , define the &quot;d&quot;th plurigenus &quot;P&quot;&quot;d&quot; as the dimension of the vector space ; then the plurigenera are birational invariants for smooth projective varieties. In particular, if any plurigenus &quot;P&quot;&quot;d&quot; with is not zero, then &quot;X&quot; is not rational.

=== Kodaira dimension ===

A fundamental birational invariant is the Kodaira dimension, which measures the growth of the plurigenera &quot;P&quot;&quot;d&quot; as &quot;d&quot; goes to infinity. The Kodaira dimension divides all varieties of dimension &quot;n&quot; into types, with Kodaira dimension −∞, 0, 1, ..., or &quot;n&quot;. This is a measure of the complexity of a variety, with projective space having Kodaira dimension −∞. The most complicated varieties are those with Kodaira dimension equal to their dimension &quot;n&quot;, called varieties of general type.

=== Summands of ⊗&quot;k&quot;Ω1 and some Hodge numbers ===
More generally, for any natural summand

:formula_27

of the &quot;r-&quot;th tensor power of the cotangent bundle Ω1 with , the vector space of global sections is a birational invariant for smooth projective varieties. In particular, the Hodge numbers

:formula_28

are birational invariants of &quot;X&quot;. (Most other Hodge numbers &quot;h&quot;&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; are not birational invariants, as shown by blowing up.)

=== Fundamental group of smooth projective varieties ===
The fundamental group &quot;π&quot;1(&quot;X&quot;) is a birational invariant for smooth complex projective varieties.

The &quot;Weak factorization theorem&quot;, proved by Abramovich, Karu, Matsuki, and Włodarczyk (2002), says that any birational map between two smooth complex projective varieties can be decomposed into finitely many blow-ups or blow-downs of smooth subvarieties. This is important to know, but it can still be very hard to determine whether two smooth projective varieties are birational.

==Minimal models in higher dimensions==

A projective variety &quot;X&quot; is called minimal if the canonical bundle &quot;KX&quot; is nef. For &quot;X&quot; of dimension 2, it is enough to consider smooth varieties in this definition. In dimensions at least 3, minimal varieties must be allowed to have certain mild singularities, for which &quot;KX&quot; is still well-behaved; these are called terminal singularities.

That being said, the minimal model conjecture would imply that every variety &quot;X&quot; is either covered by rational curves or birational to a minimal variety &quot;Y&quot;. When it exists, &quot;Y&quot; is called a minimal model of &quot;X&quot;.

Minimal models are not unique in dimensions at least 3, but any two minimal varieties which are birational are very close. For example, they are isomorphic outside subsets of codimension at least 2, and more precisely they are related by a sequence of flops. So the minimal model conjecture would give strong information about the birational classification of algebraic varieties.

The conjecture was proved in dimension 3 by Mori. There has been great progress in higher dimensions, although the general problem remains open. In particular, Birkar, Cascini, Hacon, and McKernan (2010) proved that every variety of general type over a field of characteristic zero has a minimal model.

==Uniruled varieties==

A variety is called uniruled if it is covered by rational curves. A uniruled variety does not have a minimal model, but there is a good substitute: Birkar, Cascini, Hacon, and McKernan showed that every uniruled variety over a field of characteristic zero is birational to a Fano fiber space. This leads to the problem of the birational classification of Fano fiber spaces and (as the most interesting special case) Fano varieties. By definition, a projective variety &quot;X&quot; is Fano if the anticanonical bundle formula_29 is ample. Fano varieties can be considered the algebraic varieties which are most similar to projective space.

In dimension 2, every Fano variety (known as a Del Pezzo surface) over an algebraically closed field is rational. A major discovery in the 1970s was that starting in dimension 3, there are many Fano varieties which are not rational. In particular, smooth cubic 3-folds are not rational by Clemens–Griffiths (1972), and smooth quartic 3-folds are not rational by Iskovskikh–Manin (1971). Nonetheless, the problem of determining exactly which Fano varieties are rational is far from solved. For example, it is not known whether there is any smooth cubic hypersurface in formula_30 with which is not rational.

==Birational automorphism groups==
Algebraic varieties differ widely in how many birational automorphisms they have. Every variety of general type is extremely rigid, in the sense that its birational automorphism group is finite. At the other extreme, the birational automorphism group of projective space formula_19 over a field &quot;k&quot;, known as the Cremona group &quot;Cr&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), is large (in a sense, infinite-dimensional) for . For , the complex Cremona group formula_32 is generated by the &quot;quadratic transformation&quot;

: [&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;] ↦ [1/&quot;x&quot;, 1/&quot;y&quot;, 1/&quot;z&quot;]

together with the group formula_33 of automorphisms of formula_34 by Max Noether and Castelnuovo. By contrast, the Cremona group in dimensions is very much a mystery: no explicit set of generators is known.

Iskovskikh–Manin (1971) showed that the birational automorphism group of a smooth quartic 3-fold is equal to its automorphism group, which is finite. In this sense, quartic 3-folds are far from being rational, since the birational automorphism group of a rational variety is enormous. This phenomenon of &quot;birational rigidity&quot; has since been discovered in many other Fano fiber spaces. 

== Applications ==
Birational geometry has found applications in other areas of geometry, but especially in traditional problems in algebraic geometry.

Famously the minimal model program was used to construct moduli spaces of varieties of general type by János Kollár and Nicholas Shepherd-Barron, now known as KSB moduli spaces.

Birational geometry has recently found important applications in the study of K-stability of Fano varieties through general existence results for Kähler–Einstein metrics, in the development of explicit invariants of Fano varieties to test K-stability by computing on birational models, and in the construction of moduli spaces of Fano varieties. Important results in birational geometry such as Birkar&#x27;s proof of boundedness of Fano varieties have been used to prove existence results for moduli spaces.
