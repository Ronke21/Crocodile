<text>Soham ( ) is a town and civil parish in the district of East Cambridgeshire, in Cambridgeshire, England, just off the A142 between Ely and Newmarket. Its population was 12,336 at the 2021 census.

==History==
===Archaeology===
The region between Devil&#x27;s Dyke and the line between Littleport and Shippea Hill shows a remarkable amount of archaeological findings of the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. A couple of hoards of bronze objects are found in the area of Soham, including one with swords and spearheads of the later Bronze Age as well as a gold torc, retrieved in 1938.

A large Anglo-Saxon settlement was discovered on land between Brook Street and Fordham Road, next to Roman remains in the old Fisky&#x27;s Hill area and former allotment site in 2013 and onwards. During the establishment of the Fordham Road cemetery, in the late 1800s, burial remains were also found with several high-status grave goods, including a girdle hanger, beads and jewellery. These items are now housed in the British Museum. Further Bronze and Iron Age settlements and related activity has also been noted in the north of the town during recent development on the sites. Many Neolithic items have been found whilst field walking to the East of the town along with fossils towards the bypass.

An extensive ditch system, not visible via aerial photography, has also been identified, as well as a wooden trackway in length between Fordey Farm (Barway) and Little Thetford, with associated shards of later Bronze Age pottery (1935).

=== Name and early geography ===
According to an article published in &quot;Fenland Notes &amp; Queries&quot; in 1899:


Soham Mere finds mention in Liber Eliensis relating King Cnut&#x27;s winter visit to the monks of Ely for the Feast of the Purification. This tale was elaborated as an &#x27;Old English Novelet&#x27; in 1844, describing how King Cnut&#x27;s nobles were concerned for his safety in crossing the Soham Mere ice. If the ice broke this would drown the king in the Fen waters. Cnut insisted on travelling (in a sledge) should there be a fenner to lead him across. One Brethner – an Ely fenner, named Budde or Pudding on account of his large size – elected to lead the king. Cnut replied if the ice could hold Brethner&#x27;s weight it would surely hold his. Thus the king and his retinue followed over the &quot;bending and cracking ice&quot; to Ely. Brethner, a serf, was set free by the king with some free lands for his good deed.

But by 1813 the lake was no more: an agricultural study describes the area:

===St Felix===

St Felix of Burgundy, &#x27;Apostle of the East Angles&#x27;, founded Soham Abbey in Soham around 630 AD but it was destroyed by the Danes in 870 AD. Luttingus, an Anglo-Saxon nobleman, built a cathedral and palace at Soham around 900 AD, on the site of the present-day Church of St Andrew and adjacent land.

St Andrew&#x27;s Church dates from the 12th century. Traces of the Saxon cathedral are said to still exist within the church. In 1102 Hubert de Burgh, Chief Justice of England, granted &#x27;Ranulph&#x27; certain lands in trust for the Church of St Andrew. Ranulph is recorded as the first Vicar of Soham and had a hand in designing the &#x27;new&#x27; Norman church. The current church is mainly later, the tower being the latest addition in the 15th century. This tower was built to replace a fallen crossing tower and now contains ten bells. The back six were cast in 1788, with two new trebles and two bells being recast in 1808. There are some pictures and a description of the church at the Cambridgeshire Churches website.

===Olaudah Equiano or Gustavus Vassa &#x27;The African&#x27;===

The first black British author and anti-slave activist, Olaudah Equiano, also known as Gustavus Vassa, married a local girl, Susannah Cullen, at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, on 7 April 1792 and the couple lived in the town for several years.

They had two daughters. Anna Maria was born on 16 October 1793 and baptised in St Andrew&#x27;s on 30 January 1794. Their second child, Joanna Vassa, was born on 11 April 1795 and was baptised in the parish church on 29 April 1795.

===William Case Morris===

William Case Morris (1864–1932) was born in Soham on 16 February 1864. He and his father left the town in search of a new life in 1872 after the death of his mother in 1868, finally settling in Argentina in 1874. Morris was horrified by the poverty of the street children, which led him to found several children&#x27;s homes in Buenos Aires. Morris returned to Soham shortly before his death on 15 September 1932, and was buried in the Fordham Road cemetery. He is commemorated with a statue in Palermo, Buenos Aires as well as railway stations, football stadia and a town, William C. Morris, Buenos Aires, named after him. His legacy lives on with the Biblioteca Popular William C. Morris and &#x27;Hogar el Alba&#x27; children&#x27;s homes located in Buenos Aires which help impoverished children.

===Soham rail disaster===
The town narrowly escaped destruction on 2 June 1944, during the Second World War, when a fire developed on the leading wagon of a heavy ammunition train travelling slowly through the town. The town was saved by the bravery of four railway staff, Benjamin Gimbert (driver), James Nightall (fireman), Frank Bridges (signalman) and Herbert Clarke (guard), who uncoupled the rest of the train and drove the engine and lead wagon clear of the town, where it exploded, killing Jim Nightall and Frank Bridges but causing no further deaths. Ben Gimbert survived and spent seven weeks in hospital. Although small in comparison to what would have happened if the entire train had blown up, the explosion caused substantial property damage. Gimbert and Nightall were both awarded the George Cross (Nightall posthumously). 
A permanent memorial was unveiled on 2 June 2007 by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester followed by a service in St Andrew&#x27;s Church. The memorial is constructed of Portland stone with a bronze inlay depicting interpretive artwork of the damaged train and text detailing the incident.

===Soham murders===
In August 2002, Soham became the centre of national media attention following the disappearance and murder of two 10-year-old girls, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, who both lived in Soham. They disappeared from the family home of Holly Wells in Redhouse Gardens on the evening of 4 August. Both were found dead some away, near RAF Lakenheath, on 17 August.

In December 2003, Ian Huntley, who had been employed as the caretaker at the local secondary school, Soham Village College, was convicted of their murders and sentenced to life in prison. He had given a number of police and television interviews while the girls were missing, claiming to have seen them on the evening of their disappearance, and was finally arrested several hours before their bodies were found, following the recovery of clothing belonging to the girls on the school site.

The caretaker&#x27;s house in College Close where Huntley lived and, as admitted at his trial, where the girls died, was demolished in 2004.

==Schools in Soham==

==Transport==
The A142 road from Ely to Newmarket runs past Soham, and formerly ran through the town. Soham is served by an hourly bus service Monday to Friday (the number 112, on a route linking Newmarket and Ely) with a reduced service on Saturday. Following Stagecoach&#x27;s cancellation of route 12 on 30 October 2022, Stephenson of Essex took on the route, renumbering it as route 112 to avoid clashing with its existing Newmarket to Cambridge route 12.

Soham railway station closed to passengers in 1965, and reopened in December 2021. The line through Soham remained open for passenger and goods services between the Midlands and Ipswich, Harwich and Felixstowe. After local campaigns for its reopening, it was announced in June 2020 that a new station would be built on the old site. Initial works on the station started in autumn 2020, followed by the main construction during 2021. The first timetabled passenger train to stop at Soham Station for 56 years was the 06:49 towards Ely and Peterborough on Monday 13 December 2021.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from either the Sandy Heath or Tacolneston TV transmitters. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, Heart East, and Star Radio. The town&#x27;s local newspapers are the &quot;Ely Standard&quot; and &quot;Cambridge News&quot;.

==Sport and leisure==

<text>The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS; ) is the national academy for natural sciences and the highest consultancy for science and technology of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is the world&#x27;s largest research organization, with 106 research institutes, 2 universities, 71,300 full-time employees, and 79 thousand graduate students.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences has historical origins in the Academia Sinica during the Republican era and was formerly also known by that name until the 1980s. The academy functions as the national scientific think tank and academic governing body, providing advisory and appraisal services on issues stemming from the national economy, social development, and science and technology progress. It is headquartered in Beijing, with affiliate institutes throughout China. It has also created hundreds of commercial enterprises, Lenovo being one of the most famous. 

The academy also runs the University of Science and Technology of China and the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, both of which were among the world&#x27;s top three academic institutions in the Nature Index rankings as of 2024.

==Membership==

Membership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also known by the title Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (), is a lifelong honor given to Chinese scientists who have made significant achievements in various fields. According to the &quot;Bylaws for Members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences&quot; adopted in 1992 and recently amended in the year 2014, it is the highest academic title in China. A formal CAS member must hold Chinese citizenship, although foreign citizens may be elected as CAS foreign academicians. Members older than 80 are designated as &quot;senior members&quot; and may no longer hold leading positions in the organization. Academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences carry an obligation to advance science and technology, to advocate and uphold scientific spirit, to develop a scientific and technological workforce, to attend member meetings and receive consultation and evaluation tasks, and to promote international exchanges and cooperation. Academicians can give suggestions and influence Chinese state policy related to science and technology.

== History ==
In 1956, China formally began its computing program when it launched the Twelve-Year Science Plan and formed the Beijing Institute of Computing Technology under the CAS.

In 1964, CAS debuted China&#x27;s first self-developed large digital computer, the 119. The 119 was a core technology in facilitating China&#x27;s first successful nuclear weapon test (Project 596), also in 1964.

Beginning in 1972, CAS began promoting the idea of balancing applied research with more theoretical research and in having scientific exchanges with other developing countries. 

As vice premier, Deng Xiaoping in 1975 also sought to re-orient CAS towards more theoretical research, which had not been a focus during the Cultural Revolution. Deng emphasized that &quot;the Academy of Sciences is an Academy of Sciences, not an Academy of Cabbage.&quot; Deng assigned CAS vice president Hu Yaobang to draft a plan for overhauling CAS. Deng and his aide Hu Qiaomu revised the draft and in September 1974 issued &quot;The Outline Report on the Work of the Academy of Sciences&quot;. The Outline described scientific research in China as lagging behind the needs of socialist construction and the state of the advanced countries, and stated that to catch up, China should emphasize basic science in order to develop a sound theoretical foundation.

This approach to scientific reform fell out of political favor in 1976 when Deng was purged, although it continued to be supported by many members within CAS. A month before Deng&#x27;s political return in 1977 however, the Outline Report was revived and adopted as CAS&#x27;s official policy.

Shortly after his return, Deng hosted a series of meetings on science and education in which he stated that science should become the forerunner of China&#x27;s modernization. Following these remarks, CAS prepared its goals for natural science disciplines to be achieved by 1985, stating that as a developing socialist country, China should strengthen basic scientific research through foreign exchanges.

To further promote this agenda, Deng began a campaign to promote the National Science Conference. A team led by CAS vice president Fang Yi instructed schools, factories, and communes to organize youth-focused events celebrating science and technology.

In 1977, the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences was split off of CAS and reorganized into the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and led by Hu Qiaomu.

The Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) was established in 2001 as a successor to the Graduate School of the University of Science and Technology of China (Beijing).The Ministry of Education (MOE) approved the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) application to change its name to the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) on July 23, 2012. Additionally, the MOE recommended that CAS discontinue the operation of the CAS Graduate School. In 2023, the Pasteur Institute suspended ties with CAS.

==Scientific integrity==
On 26 February 2007, CAS published a &quot;Declaration of Scientific Ideology&quot; and set up a commission for scientific integrity to promote transparency, autonomy and accountability of scientific research in the country. Around that same time, the Ministry of Science and Technology also initiated measures to address misconduct in state-funded programs.

== Publications ==
Together with the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the academy publishes the peer-reviewed academic journal, &quot;Science China&quot; (also known as &quot;Science in China&quot;). &quot;Science China&quot; comprises seven series:
* A: Mathematics
* B: Chemistry
* C: Life Sciences
* D: Earth Sciences
* E: Technological Sciences
* F: Information Sciences
* G: Physics, Mechanics and Astronomy

CAS also promotes the &quot;China Open Access Journals&quot; (COAJ) platform, a national variant of the international Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).

==Awards==
Since 1999, the CAS has issued the annual State Preeminent Science and Technology Award, presented by the President of China to the recipient.

== Ranking and reputation ==
CAS has been ranked the No. 1 research institute in the world by Nature Index since the list&#x27;s inception in 2014 by Nature Portfolio. 

It was the most productive institution publishing articles on sustainable development indexed in the Web of Science from 1981 to 2018 among all universities and research institutions in the world. 

The academy also runs the University of Science and Technology of China and the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, both of which were among the world&#x27;s top three universities in the Nature Index ranking as of 2024.

In 2024, Clarivate&#x27;s Highly Cited Researchers list contained 308 CSA members. This made CSA researchers the largest group on the list by institution, and the sixth largest by country.

== International cooperation ==
The Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth is a branch of CAS. The Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth was a customer of Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), which provides data transmission services from satellites for a wide range of societal functions. It was reported by Reuters on 21 September 2020 that SSC decided not to renew the contracts with China to help operate Chinese satellites from SSC&#x27;s ground stations, or seek new business with China.

<doc id="377857" wikidata="Q2591863" url="?curid=377857" title="Ford Country Squire">
<text>The Ford Country Squire is a series of full-size station wagons that were assembled by American automaker Ford. Positioned as the top-level station wagon of the Ford division, the Country Squire was distinguished by woodgrain bodyside trim. From 1950 through the 1991 model years, eight generations of the Country Squire were produced. Following the discontinuation of Edsel Bermuda, Mercury marketed the Mercury Colony Park as a divisional counterpart of the Country Squire, sharing bodywork and trim while the Mercury was not available with a six cylinder engine and was more expensive due to the optional equipment on the Ford that was standard on the Mercury.

As part of the full-size Ford model range, the Country Squire was the top trim package station wagon counterpart of several model lines. For its first two generations, the Country Squire was based upon the Ford Custom Deluxe and the Ford Crestline that replaced it, along with the more modestly equipped Ford Country Sedan which was identical in dimensions except for the woodgrain appearance and minimal standard equipment. For its next three generations, the Country Squire was a distinct model range; initially sharing its trim with the Ford Fairlane, the Country Squire later adopted trim of the Ford Galaxie. For its final two generations, the Country Squire became a counterpart of Ford LTD and the Ford LTD Crown Victoria after its downsizing for the last generation, while sharing multiple passenger accommodation duties with the Ford Aerostar.

The Country Squire was discontinued as part of the development of the 1992 Ford Crown Victoria and passenger carrying duties were given to the Ford Windstar. The decline in full-size station wagon sales meant the Crown Victoria was exclusively a four-door sedan. The 41-year production run of the Country Squire is the third-longest of a Ford car nameplate in North America, surpassed only by the Ford Thunderbird and Ford Mustang which is to date still in production.

The term squire is a British term that refers to a village leader or a lord of the manor, which is also called a &quot;squire&quot;, and the term was applied to members of the landed gentry.

== Woodgrain trim ==
Although all Ford Country Squires feature wood-grain body trim, only the first-generation 1950-1951 versions are true &quot;Woodies&quot;. The genuine wood body panels were manufactured at the Ford Iron Mountain Plant in the Michigan Upper Peninsula from lumber owned by Ford Motor Company. For 1952, all-steel bodies replaced wooden body structures to reduce production costs. Subsequently, exterior body trim consisted of simulated woodgrain (with varying degrees of coverage on the body).

During the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, Ford would use the Squire nameplate on intermediate, mid-size, compact, and subcompact vehicles, denoting station wagons with woodgrain exterior trim. Alongside full-size Fords, the Squire name was used for the Falcon, Fairlane, Torino, Pinto, Granada, Gran Torino, LTD II, Fairmont, Escort, and mid-size LTD (the last model range to use the name). The Squire name was also used on woodgrain-trim versions of the Ranchero; in 1976, Ford offered a Pinto Squire two-door hatchback.

== First generation (1950–1951) ==
For the 1949 model year, Ford introduced its first post-war model line. While retaining body-on-frame construction, the 1949 Ford chassis abandoned several design elements retained by Ford since the Model T, including a torque tube driveshaft and transverse leaf springs. In a major change, Ford sought to change the marketing of station wagons, transitioning their use from a commercial vehicle to a premium family vehicle. The listed retail price was US$2,119 ($ in dollars ) and 31,412 were manufactured.

Designed by Eugene Gregorie and Ross Cousins, the Ford station wagon marked the first transition away from the full &quot;woodie&quot;. In place of a complete wooden body aft of the firewall, the 1949 Ford station wagon was designed with a steel roof, rear fenders, and tailgate frame. Wood construction remained for the side bodywork and upper and lower tailgate (using mahogany plywood trimmed by maple or birch). Sharing its body with Mercury, the Ford station wagon was offered in Custom trim. To reduce noise and improve sealing, the station wagon was offered with two doors instead of four; however, three seats were used, allowing eight-passenger seating.

For the 1950 model year, Ford renamed its model lines; initially, the station wagon was a Custom Deluxe with the all new &quot;Country Squire&quot; name introduced in early 1950. Several revisions were made for 1950 to improve functionality and capability. The second and third-row seats were redesigned, allowing their removal without tools. In another change, the Country Squire also received heavier-duty rear-suspension, wider tires, and a larger fuel tank over Ford sedans.

Following its introduction, the Country Squire underwent several revisions distinct from Ford sedans. For 1950, the spare-tire cover was deleted; in April 1950, the lower tailgate was redesigned, changing from all-wood construction to steel construction (with wood trim). For 1951, the Country Squire retained the dashboard of the 1950 Ford (with the 1951 steering column).

=== Assembly ===
As a true &quot;woodie&quot;, assembly of the Country Squire was labor-intensive, requiring completion at three assembly plants. Initial assembly of the steel body was completed at the Dearborn Assembly Plant, with the incomplete body shipped to the Iron Mountain plant for the fitment of wood paneling; upon completion, the bodies were shipped back to various Ford assembly facilities for final assembly (mounting to frames, fitment of interiors).

For 1951, Ford outsourced final assembly of the Country Squire, contracting Ionia Body Company (an assembler of wood-bodied station wagons for General Motors).

=== Powertrain ===
During its production, the first-generation Country Squire was available with engines shared with Ford sedans. The standard engine was a 226 cubic-inch 95 hp H-series inline-6, with a 239 cubic-inch 100 hp Flathead V8. For 1950, a 3-speed manual was standard, with a 3-speed Ford-O-Matic automatic becoming an option in 1951.

== Second generation (1952–1954) ==
Following a redesign of the Ford model line for the 1952 model year, the second generation of the Country Squire was introduced, marking several major changes to the model line. While sharing much of its body (though not its wheelbase) with the newly introduced Mercury Monterey, only the Country Squire featured wood paneling as standard. In a wider revision for 1952, Ford introduced station wagon counterparts for each of its sedan lines; the Country Squire was the equivalent of the Crestline sedan. Slotted below the Country Squire were the four-door Country Sedan (Customline) and the two-door Ranch Wagon (Mainline).

=== Model overview ===
Designed by Gordon Buehrig, the second-generation Country Squire was developed under a goal to maximize parts commonality between sedan and station wagon model lines. While gaining an inch in wheelbase, the second-generation Country Squire was reduced approximately 10 inches in length over its predecessor while adding two more doors for rear passengers.

In contrast to the Country Sedan, two-tone paint was not offered for the Country Squire; and the only exterior colors offered were Alpine Blue, Carnival Red metallic, Meadowbrook Green, Sungate Ivory and Glenmist Green, and they were color-keyed to the wood exterior trim. Matching the wood trim, the interior was offered in a single tan/brown color scheme. As with the previous generation, the second-generation Country Squire used a two-piece tailgate. The spare tire was relocated under the load floor, with the upper half of the tailgate opened by counterbalanced hinges. The listed retail price was US$2,384 ($ in dollars ) and production numbers dropped significantly with the introduction of the all steel bodied Country Sedan and the more upscale Mercury Monterey wood-bodied station wagon, having only built 5,426.

Over its production, the second generation received several minor revisions. For 1953 (marking the 50th anniversary of Ford), the Country Squire featured a commemorative steering wheel center and rear-door armrests became standard. For 1954, the range of color choices were expanded from six to twelve (remaining single-color exteriors), with red, blue/white, or green/white interiors replacing the previous tan/brown interior. Several power-assisted features became introduced; in 1953, power steering became an option, with power brakes and a power-adjusted front seat introduced for 1954.

==== Powertrain ====
For the 1952 and 1953 model years, the Country Squire was offered with a 110 hp 239 cubic-inch V8 (inline-sixes were offered only for the Ranch Wagon). For 1954, in line with all Fords, the Flathead V8 was replaced by the overhead-valve Y-block V8. While built with the same displacement as the Flathead V8, the Y-block increased output from . The inline-six was redesigned, with a version becoming the standard engine, producing .

=== Assembly changes ===
Marketed as premium vehicles, wood-bodied station wagons were labor-intensive to assemble (and maintain). To reduce assembly and ownership costs, the Country Squire abandoned wood-paneled construction for a full-steel body. To distinguish itself from the Country Sedan, DI-NOC (vinyl transfers) was used to simulate the mahogany paneling, accented by birch or maple. To further simulate the &quot;woodie&quot; look, woodgrain transfers were applied to the window frames and upper liftgate. For 1954, the wood trim was replaced by fiberglass, colored with a woodgrain finish.

== Third generation (1955–1956) ==

For the 1955 model year, the third generation of the Country Squire was introduced. Functionally an update of the second generation, the body underwent several styling revisions, along with multiple functional upgrades. The Crestline was discontinued, with the Country Squire becoming the counterpart of the all-new top level Fairlane sedan line. The listed retail price was $2,392 ($ in dollars ) and production increased to 19,011.

For 1955, Ford consolidated its three station wagons into a distinct model line separate from its sedans. In a change that would last through 1968, the Country Squire was the flagship Ford station wagon, with the four-door (non-wood) Country Sedan and the two-door Ranch Wagon. In 1956, the two-door Parklane was introduced; intended to compete with the Chevrolet Nomad, the Parklane combined the body of the Ranch Wagon with the trim of the Fairlane (similar to the Country Squire interior).

=== Model overview ===
Largely carryover from 1954, the Country Squire chassis retained its 115.5 inch wheelbase and chassis underpinnings. While the roofline from the B-pillar rearward was essentially identical from the previous generation, a panoramic windshield (with a vertical A-pillar) was introduced. The wood trim was revised, with the DI-NOC transfers adopting the style of a wood-bodied motorboat; the fiberglass trim was extended into the front fenders (the simulated &quot;ponton fender&quot; was removed). For the first time, power windows were offered as an option, at the time considered a luxury feature.

For 1956, alongside all Fords, the Country Squire received a new grille, distinguished by rectangular turn signals/parking lights and wider openings. In a functional change, Ford upgraded to a 12-volt electrical system, allowing additional starting power and capability with electrical-power options. Coinciding with the upgrade, air conditioning was introduced as an option. The Lifeguard option package was introduced, offering a deep-dish steering wheel, upgraded door latches (to prevent ejection); as an option, seat belts and a padded dashboard were offered.

==== Powertrain ====
Carried over from the previous generation, the standard engine of the third-generation Country Squire was the &quot;Mileage Maker&quot; inline-6, increasing output to . For the first time, the Country Squire was available with several optional V8 engines with multiple power outputs. Shared with the Fairlane, a Y-block V8 produced (2-barrel carburetor) or (4-barrel carburetor). Shared with the Thunderbird, a V8 produced 198 hp. For 1956, the 272 was replaced by the 292, increased to . A Y-block (shared with the Thunderbird and Mercury) offered up to was optional only by special order.

== Fourth generation (1957–1959) ==
For 1957, the Ford model line underwent its first complete redesign for the first time since 1952. In line with other American manufacturers, a central part of the redesign was lower body height, requiring an all-new chassis to accommodate a lower floor. The only station wagon with standard-equipment wood paneling (of any type) from 1954 to 1956, the Country Squire was joined by the Mercury Colony Park in 1957 and briefly with the Edsel Bermuda in 1958.

=== Model overview ===
Coinciding with the use of a lower body and interior floor, the fourth generation was wider than its predecessor, increasing from eight passenger-seating to nine for the first time. For the fourth-generation Country Squire, Ford returned to extensive annual model revisions, with only the roofline and doors shared between all three model years. For 1957 27,690 were manufactured with a listed retail price of $2,556 ($ in dollars ).

==== Chassis specifications ====
The 1957 Ford chassis was a split-wheelbase platform; the 118-inch wheelbase was exclusive to the Fairlane, with Ford (and Edsel) station wagons sharing a 116-inch wheelbase with the Ford Custom. To allow for a lower floor, the frame layout changed from a truck-style ladder frame to a perimeter frame. A configuration used until the 2011 discontinuation of the Ford Crown Victoria, the perimeter frame allowed the floorpan to sit between the frame rails (instead of above them). To further reduce vehicle height, the rear leaf springs were moved outboard of the frame rails and the wheels were decreased in diameter from 15 to 14 inches.

For 1958, rear air suspension became an option for the first time; intended to keep the load floor at a constant height, the system saw few buyers. In line with all Ford sedans, the 1959 Country Squire adopted the 118-inch wheelbase previously exclusive to the Fairlane.

===== Powertrain =====
For 1957, the Country Squire carried over all three engines from the 1956 model year, with revised power outputs. A 144 hp 223 cubic-inch Mileage Maker inline-6 was the standard engine. The 292 cubic-inch V8 returned (with a two-barrel carburetor), producing 212 hp. Three versions of the 312 cubic-inch V8 were offered: 245 hp (four-barrel), 270 hp (dual four-barrel), and 300 hp (dual four-barrel, supercharger).

For 1958, while the inline-6 returned, the Y-block engines were replaced with an all-new set of V8 engines, named the FE-series (Ford/Edsel). Two displacements were available, a 332 cubic-inch V8 (240 hp with a 2-barrel carburetor; 265 hp with a 4-barrel carburetor) or 352 cubic inches (300 horsepower, four-barrel carburetor). For 1959, the engine line was revised further, with a 200 hp 292 V8 becoming the standard V8, the two-barrel 332 detuned to 225 hp (the four-barrel version discontinued); the 300-hp 352 V8 remained.

Alongside the 3-speed and 4-speed manual transmissions, Ford offered the 3-speed Fordomatic automatic. Coinciding with the 1958 introduction of the FE-series V8s, the 3-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic was introduced. Designed to make better use of all three gears, Cruise-O-Matic started in first gear (Fordomatic started in second, with first gear selected by downshifting into &quot;L&quot;).

==== Body ====
In a major shift, for 1957, Ford station wagons no longer shared a body with a Mercury counterpart; instead, the body was developed for the Edsel line of station wagons, with the Country Squire becoming the counterpart of the Edsel Bermuda (distinguished by its combination of woodgrain sides &quot;and&quot; two-tone paint). While based on the shorter wheelbase of the Ford Custom, the Country Squire still shared trim with the Fairlane. Along with Ford sedans, the Country Squire adopted several design elements of the 1957 Ford Thunderbird, including its wraparound windshield (restyled with a forward-slanted A-pillar), short tailfins, and large round taillamps.

To further expand load capacity, the folding mechanism of the middle seat was redesigned, allowing for a completely flat load floor when stowed (the rear seat still had to be removed). To improve loading, the top half of the liftgate was widened, extending into the D-pillars.

For 1958, the front and rear fascias underwent a revision; while largely to accommodate quad headlamps, the taillamp design was revised (replacing two round taillamps with four oval ones) alongside the design of the wood trim. In a functional change, the liftgate mechanism was redesigned.

For 1959, coinciding with the wheelbase extension, the Country Squire grew over five inches in length. Adopting styling elements of the Mercury Country Cruiser Colony Park and the Edsel Villager, the Country Squire had a less angled front fascia with a wider grille, two large round taillamps, and redesigned tailfins (with turn signal lenses). In a major change, the simulated wood trim around the roof pillars was replaced by stainless steel, leaving the wood trim below the window line. The third seat was redesigned, allowing it to fold flat (after seat cushions were removed and stowed).

=== Sales ===
== Fifth generation (1960–1964) ==
For the 1960 model year, in place of a yearly update, the Ford model line underwent a complete redesign. Coinciding with the introduction of the compact Falcon, full-size Fords grew in size, adopting a 119-inch wheelbase. As part of a model shift, the Galaxie was slotted above the Fairlane as the flagship Ford model range, with the Country Squire becoming its station wagon counterpart for 1960. For 1961, Mercury revised its model range following the discontinuation of Edsel, with the Monterey becoming a longer-wheelbase version of the Galaxie; in a change that would last until their 1991 discontinuation, the Colony Park became the more exclusive and upscale Mercury counterpart to the Country Squire. The 1960 version with the V8 was listed at US$3,080 ($ in dollars ) before optional equipment was added. Starting with 1962, the Galaxie became the senior, full-size model series when the Ford Fairlane became the intermediate model series on a shorter wheelbase, and was also offered as a station wagon with optionally available woodgrained appearance.

=== Model overview ===
Retaining the use of a perimeter frame, the Country Squire grew in size over its predecessor, five inches wider and five inches longer than its predecessor. The wood exterior trim returned to the appearance of boat decking, with a simpler border trim design. To improve entry and exit, the forward-sloping A-pillar was replaced by a rearward-sloping design, allowing for wider front door opening. While the third-row seat still required the removal of the lower cushion to fold flat, access was improved as one-third of the second-row seat folded separately.

==== Chassis specifications ====
The 1960 Ford chassis, used by the fifth-generation Country Squire with a 119-inch wheelbase, shared with all other full-size Ford models. To improve handling, the rear leaf suspension was redesigned with longer springs, as part of anti-dive and anti-squat control. The front suspension is a double wishbone configuration, with ball-jointed A-arms. Shared with the F-Series, the Country Squire used 11-inch drum brakes on all four wheels.

===== Powertrain =====
At its launch, the fifth-generation retained several engines from the previous generation. A 145 hp 223 cubic-inch inline-six was standard, with three optional V8 engines. A 292 cubic-inch V8 (retuned to 185 hp) made its return, along with a 352 cubic-inch V8 (235 hp with 2-barrel; 300 hp with 4-barrel). For 1961, the engines were detuned, with the six making 135 hp, the 292 175 hp, and the 352 220 hp (the 300 hp V8 remained). For 1962, the engines were retuned to 138 hp for the inline-6 and 170 hp for the 292; while the 220 hp version of the 352 remained, the 300 hp version was replaced by a 390 cubic-inch V8 producing 300 hp (the only version of the 390 offered with the Country Squire). For 1963, the 292 V8 was discontinued, replaced by a 164 hp 260 cubic-inch V8. For 1964, the 260 V8 was expanded to 289 cubic inches (producing 195 hp); the 352 was retuned to 250 hp.

As with the previous generation, three and four-speed (overdrive) manual transmissions were offered, along with three-speed Fordomatic or Cruise-O-Matic automatics. For 1964, the 3-speed manual was redesigned, becoming synchronized in all three gears.

==== Body ====
In contrast to the fourth generation Country Squire, the fifth generation largely abandoned yearly body updates. The body design was more conservative, integrating the headlights into the grille and fairing the bumper more closely into the fenders. For 1961, the rear tailgate underwent a complete redesign, abandoning the two-piece tailgate for a one-piece tailgate with a roll-down window which had been previously offered on Mercury station wagons as standard equipment beginning in 1957. As part of the tailgate design, a safety lockout required the rear window to be fully lowered before the tailgate could be lowered; the window was lowered either manually or electrically. On both tailgate designs, the tailgate used a torsion bar spring to counterbalance its hinge.

Coinciding with the liftgate redesign for 1961, the front and rear fascias were redesigned, marking the return of (small) tailfins and large round taillamps, in line with the Ford Thunderbird. For 1964, the Country Squire underwent a facelift of its rear fascia (deleting the tailfins) and its side trim, with a redesign of the wood trim.

=== Sales ===
== Sixth generation (1965–1968) ==
For the 1965 model year, the full-size Ford model line underwent a complete redesign with an all-new chassis. Alongside the introduction of the Ford LTD, the Country Squire was a counterpart of the Galaxie 500 model line alongside the non-woodgrain Country Sedan (alongside the standard Galaxie). The 1965 version with the V8 was listed at US$3,216 ($ in dollars ).

During the production of the sixth-generation Country Squire, wood-trimmed station wagons (in simulated form) underwent a revival in production. Previously exclusive to Ford and Mercury from 1954 to 1965, counterpart station wagons entered production during the end of the 1960s. For 1966, Chrysler reintroduced wood trim for the Town &amp; Country station wagon (and for the first Dodge Monaco station wagon). General Motors introduced wood trim for the 1966 Chevrolet Caprice Estate and in 1967 for the Buick Sport Wagon and Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser. As part of the 1968 introduction of the intermediate Ford Torino and Mercury Montego, a Torino Squire and Montego Villager station wagon were introduced with woodgrain exterior trim.

As the LTD became a full model line for the 1968 model year, the Country Squire became its station wagon counterpart, with Ford adding &quot;LTD&quot; badging to the hood. The 1968 LTD 9-passenger version with the V8 was listed at US$3,619 ($ in dollars ) before optional equipment installed.

=== Model overview ===
To comply with the implementation of safety regulations in the United States, many running changes were made during this generation, effectively standardizing the equipment introduced by the Lifeguard option package. For 1966, Ford standardized front and rear seat belts, a padded dashboard and sun visors, a deep-dish steering wheel, reinforced door latches, and emergency flashers. For 1967, as part of federal regulations, the steering wheel was fitted with a padded center and fitted to an energy-absorbing (collapsible) steering column; other requirements included padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors. As an added degree of redundancy, a dual-chamber brake master cylinder was added for the 1968 model year (on the Country Squire, alongside all other vehicles sold in the United States).

==== Chassis specifications ====
The rear-wheel drive 1965 Ford chassis used by the sixth-generation Country Squire retained the 119-inch wheelbase of the previous generation. For higher strength and rigidity, the frame rails became fully-boxed; the perimeter frame configuration was retained. While again using a double-wishbone, ball-jointed A-arm configuration for the front suspension, the front track width was widened to improve handling. The rear leaf springs were discontinued, replaced with a three-link coil-sprung solid rear axle; in various forms, Ford would use this suspension configuration on rear-wheel drive full-size vehicles through the production of the final Ford Crown Victoria in 2011.

===== Powertrain =====
For the sixth generation, the Country Squire (alongside Ford full-size Country Sedan and F-Series trucks) received a new standard engine, with a 240 cubic-inch &quot;Big Six&quot; inline-6 (producing 150 hp) replacing the 223 cubic-inch &quot;Mileage Maker&quot; six. The three V8 engines were retained from the previous generations, with a 200 hp 289 cubic-inch V8, a 250 hp 352 cubic-inch V8, and a 300 hp 390 cubic-inch V8. For 1966, two versions of the 390 were introduced, producing 275 hp (2-bbl) or 315 hp (4-bbl). For the first time, a 428 cubic-inch V8 was offered on the Country Squire, producing 345 hp. For 1967, the 352 FE V8 was dropped, largely replaced by the 2-bbl version of the 390 (producing 270 hp). For 1968, the 289 was expanded to , producing 210 hp. The 2-bbl 390 and 428 were retuned, making 265 and 340 hp, respectively.

While maintaining powertrain commonality with the Ford Galaxie, on an official basis, Ford did not offer the Country Squire with any version of the 428 V8 producing over 345 hp, nor any 427 V8.

For the sixth-generation Country Squire, the 3-speed column-shifted manual made its return, along with the 4-speed overdrive manual. For 1967 only, a floor-shifted 4-speed manual was offered for the Country Squire (only with the 390 and 428 V8s). The Fordomatic 3-speed automatic was retired, with Cruise-O-Matic replaced by several 3-speed automatic designs marketed under the SelectShift name; the C4 was developed for inline-6 and small V8s, while the C6 was developed for large V8s; the FMX was introduced for medium-size engines in 1968.

==== Body ====
For the sixth generation, the Country Squire again shared its doors with four-door Ford sedans. While the roofline of the Country Squire was shared with the Mercury Colony Park, the two model lines shared different bodywork below the window lines (including front fascias and rear quarter panels). In a major styling change, full-size Ford&#x27;s adopted vertically-stacked headlamps, raising the hood line and enlarging the grille.

In a design change that would last through its 1991 discontinuation, the 1965 Country Squire replaced the third-row rear seat configuration for two (optional) flat-folding rear seats facing towards the center of the cargo area, expanding seating to 10 passengers. Coinciding with all full-size Fords, the Country Squire adopted two-sided keys for 1965, introducing a valet key (while unlocking the front doors and starting the car, the key would not unlock the glovebox and rear cargo door).

Following a minor grille update for the 1967 model year, the Country Squire underwent an exterior update for the 1968 model year. Coinciding with the introduction of the 1966 Ford Thunderbird and its alignment with the Ford LTD, the Country Squire adopted its split-grille front fascia and no longer offering vertically stacked dual headlights, and adopting optionally available, vacuum-operated hidden headlamps; as a fail-safe, the system retracted the headlamp covers if engine vacuum was lost. While the feature was shared with the Colony Park (and its Marquis counterpart), the redesign marked a significant differentiation of front fascia designs between the two model lines. In another change, the taillamps switched from a square design (derived from the traditional Ford round taillamps of the 1940s and 1950s) to a vertically-oriented rectangle (a design used to 1991).

===== Magic Doorgate =====
For 1966, all Ford wagons introduced the Magic Doorgate rear door configuration. Engineered by Donald N. Frey, the two-way tailgate configuration allowed the rear door to fold down (like a traditional tailgate) or hinge open to the side (as a door). The Magic Doorgate was made possible through a traditional stationary hinge on the passenger side and a combination of hinges on the driver side, carrying the weight of the tailgate when it swung outward. While opened by the exterior or interior door handle, the rear door would not open to the side or fold down unless the rear window was retracted.

In various adaptations, the two-way rear door would become utilized on full-size station wagons across Ford, General Motors, and AMC during the 1970s.

=== Sales ===
== Seventh generation (1969–1978) ==
For the 1969 model year, the full-size Ford model line underwent a complete redesign, increasing in wheelbase from 119 inches to 121 inches. In a consolidation of its branding, Ford station wagons and sedans were no longer distinct model lines. After adding LTD hood badging in 1968, the Country Squire was added to the model range for 1969, slotted above the (Galaxie) Country Sedan and (Custom 500) Ranch Wagon. Starting with 1969 the &quot;Big Six&quot; six-cylinder was no longer offered on the Country Squire while it continued with the Country Sedan and Ranch Wagon. The 1969 ten-passenger version was listed at US$3,721 ($ in dollars ).

===1969–1972===

For the 1969 model year, a new generation of Ford and Mercury cars made their debut; station wagons for both divisions rode on a 121-inch wheelbase shared with the Ford sedan line, a gain of two inches. The &quot;Magic Doorgate&quot; tailgate was updated to a 3-way design: it could now swing down like a tailgate or swing out with the window down or up (the latter was previously not possible).

As part of the LTD line, the Country Squire wore similar interior trim; with the obvious exception of its simulated woodgrain paneling, Country Squires wore the same bodywork from the windshield forward as their LTD sedan counterparts. For the 1970 model year, visible changes were limited to detail changes in bumper and grille trim and lost the divider bar. In 1971, the Country Squire would be given an extensive facelift with only the roof and tailgate carried over from the 1970 model, sharing visual similarities with the 1970 Ford Thunderbird; as with the LTD, it would lose its hidden headlamps in the grille while the feature was added to the Mercury Colony Park due to its luxurious appearance shared with the 1969 Lincoln Continental.

Initially, the standard engine was a 302 cubic-inch V8, replaced by a 351 cubic-inch V8 midway through the 1969 model year. As with its LTD counterpart, the 390 and 429 V8 engines were options. In 1971, the 390 V8 was replaced by a 402 cubic-inch V8 (though sold as a 400). For a variety of reasons, 1972 saw a major decrease in powertrain output. That year, gross horsepower was replaced by SAE net horsepower. The addition of emissions controls and the adoption of unleaded fuel required lowered compression ratios and retarded ignition timing. In one example, the range-topping 429 V8 would see its output drop from 365 hp to 212 hp from 1971 to 1972. In 1972, the 429 was joined by a 224-hp 460 cubic-inch V8 seen previously in the Lincoln lineup.
=== Sales ===
===1973–1978===
For the 1973 model year, the Ford full-size car line was given a major update. While still built on the same chassis and 121-inch wheelbase, the addition of 5 mph bumpers would add over six inches in length to the LTD Country Squire by the end of the 1974 model year. These would also be the longest and heaviest station wagons ever produced by Ford. The 1973 ten-passenger was listed at US$4,401 ($ in dollars ).

For 1974, 5-mph bumpers were added to the rear, a transistorized ignition system was introduced, as well as a new hood ornament. In addition, the 429 was dropped, largely replaced by the essentially identical 460 V8.

For 1975, Ford began to pare down its wagon lineup as the Custom 500 Ranch Wagon was relegated exclusively to fleet sales and the Galaxie Country Sedan was discontinued, replaced by a non-woodgrain LTD wagon. To better distinguish the LTD Country Squire, Ford returned hidden headlamps to the model, a feature associated with top-line LTD Landau (and Mercury Marquis) models. In all models, catalytic converters were now standard equipment to comply with emissions regulations.

1975-1978 models were nearly identical except for small differences in trim and emblems from year to year. As a move to increase fuel economy, the 351 cubic-inch V8 was reintroduced for 1978.

The standard engine on all other full-size Ford sedans and wagons was the 351 Windsor V8. The Country Squire however, came standard with the Cleveland 400M V8, while the 385-series 429 and 460 V8s were optional. With manual transmissions being dropped from the lineup, the C6 3-speed automatic transmission was now the only transmission option for full-size Fords. The 429 and 460 V8s were a common option due to the especially sluggish performance of the detuned 400 engine that was now struggling to drive the ever-increasing weight of a Country Squire.

== Eighth generation (1979–1991) ==
For 1979, Ford downsized its full-size car lines. Eleven inches shorter and nearly 1000 pounds lighter than its 1978 predecessor, the redesigned Country Squire retained its 8-passenger seating capability with only slightly reduced cargo capacity. While retaining a V8 engine, the Country Squire shifted from the 400 and 460 V8 to the and Windsor V8s, sharing engines with the Ford Granada. When this generation of station wagon was introduced, the wheelbase was longer than the intermediate 1962 Ford Fairlane station wagon and was shorter than the 1972 Ford Gran Torino Squire station wagon.

For 1983, as Ford underwent a revision of its full-size model lines, the Country Squire remained in production; as the LTD became the replacement for the mid-size Granada, the Country Squire became the counterpart for the LTD Crown Victoria. In another change, the 4.9L V8 adopted throttle-body fuel injection. For 1986, the V8 was updated again, adopting sequential multi-port fuel injection (identified by a large EFI 5.0-badged intake above the engine).

For 1988, the Country Squire received its first external updates since 1979, sharing the front fascia update of its sedan counterpart; new front seats received larger head restraints. For 1990, the dashboard received its first major update (since 1979) with the addition of a driver-side airbag; the outboard rear seats received 3-point seatbelts. For 1991, the front turn signal/parking lamp lenses were changed from amber to clear.

===Discontinuation===
During the mid-1980s, sales of full-size station wagons began to decline, following the introduction of the Chrysler minivans and the Ford Aerostar. By 1991, the Country Squire was the slowest-selling Ford vehicle in North America, with less than 4,000 produced. Production of the 1991 model ceased in December 1990.

For 1992, as Ford redesigned its Ford and Mercury full-size vehicles, the station wagon body style was not included in the redesign, although there is published photographic evidence that a full-size clay model for a 1992 Country Sedan was made in 1988. General Motors redesigned its B-platform station wagons for 1991, which were poorly received in the marketplace.

At Ford, the role of the 8-passenger station wagon was passed onto the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable; redesigned alongside the Crown Victoria for 1992, the Ford Taurus became the best-selling car in the United States. Functionally, the role of the family towing vehicle in the Ford product line was split between the Aerostar (and the larger Ford Club Wagon) as well as the then-new Ford Explorer (as buyers began to shift towards SUVs).
†non-woodgrain LTD Crown Victoria and Country Squire wagons counted as one total starting in 1983††286,673 units total, including non-woodgrain wagons produced 1979–1982
==Unique options and features==
With certain versions of the Country Squire, an AM/FM-Cassette stereo with a combined and fully integrated Citizens&#x27; Band (CB) two-way radio, and replacement dual-purpose automatic antenna (with only one visible difference; the aerial mast was a larger diameter, and black-band at approximately half-way up). The radio would then have the appearance of an original equipment, factory radio.

Other options included opposing side-facing rear seats, which could be folded down to make a durable cargo surface. Available for use with the side-facing rear seats was a folding table with an integrated magnetic checkers board. Magnets under the plastic checker pieces would keep them from sliding on the board while the vehicle was in motion.

Behind a rear fender well was a hidden, lockable compartment, not visible when the rear seatback was in the upright position.

GM, Chrysler and AMC would adopt a similar configuration by the end of the 1960s. An advanced version of this was the 3-way tailgate which permitted opening the door sideways with the window up. Otherwise, the tailgate could be hinged downwards only after operating the lock which was accessible from the outside only with the window lowered.

<text>Academia Sinica (AS, ; ) is the national academy of the Republic of China (Taiwan). It is headquartered in Nangang, Taipei. 

Founded in Nanjing, the academy supports research activities in mathematical and physical sciences, to life sciences, and to humanities and social sciences. As an educational institute, it provides PhD training and scholarship through its English-language Taiwan International Graduate Program in biology, agriculture, chemistry, physics, informatics, and earth and environmental sciences. 

The current president since 2016 is James C. Liao, an expert in metabolic engineering, systems biology and synthetic biology.

==History==

Academia Sinica, which means &quot;Chinese Academy&quot;, was founded in 1928 in Nanjing, then capital of the Republic of China, with its first meeting held in Shanghai. By December 1948, all fourteen institutes of the Academia Sinica had agreed to move from Nanjing to Taiwan alongside other institutions of the government of the Republic of China as a result of the Chinese Civil War. In the end, only the Academia Sinica&#x27;s Institute of History and Philology was relocated to Taiwan, because the head of the Institute of Mathematics, Jiang Lifu, resigned his position in June 1949, and never traveled to Taiwan.

Of the 81 inaugural research fellows appointed by the Academia Sinica prior to its move, nine crossed the Taiwan Strait. The institution was low on monetary funds, and reopened with the Institute of History and Philology in December 1954. In the same year, its main campus was constructed in , Nangang, Taipei. Due to the importance of agriculture to the economy of Taiwan, efforts were made to revive the Institute of Botany. The second convocation of the Academia Sinica was held in 1957. At the same time, the mainland part of Academia Sinica remained functioning under Communist rule and was renamed as the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the 1980s.

In the 2000s, many of the current institutes and research centers were established, partially through reorganization of old ones. Academia Sinica&#x27;s first PhD program, the Taiwan International Graduate Program, was inaugurated in 2006.

==Leadership==
The president of Academia Sinica is appointed by the president of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from three candidates recommended by the Council Meeting. The president of Academia Sinica must be an academician. After the appointment, the president serves a five-year term and can serve up to two consecutive terms.

Academia Sinica&#x27;s current president is James C. Liao, a biochemist, who replaced Chi-Huey Wong, a biological chemist and the Parsons Foundation Professor and Chair of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, as the 11th president on 21 June 2016. The list of past presidents also includes Hu Shih, a philosopher and essayist, and a key contributor to Chinese liberalism and language reform in his advocacy for the use of vernacular Chinese, as well as an influential redology scholar and holder of the Jiaxu manuscript () until his death. The fifth president, Yuan T. Lee, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for &quot;contributions to the dynamics of chemical elementary processes&quot;.

===Presidents===
* Cai Yuanpei (1928–1940)
* Chu Chia-Hua (Acting, 1940–1957)
* Hu Shih (1958–1962)
* Wang Shih-Chieh (1962–1970)
* Chien Shih-Liang (1970–1983) 
* Wu Ta-You (1983–1994) 
* Yuan T. Lee (1994–2006)
* Chi-Huey Wong (2006–2016)
* James C. Liao (2016–)

==Convocation==

The Convocation of Academia Sinica consists of 281 academicians, including 105 domestic and 176 overseas appointed scientists. Seven academicians of Academia Sinica are Nobel laureates. Academician membership is an honorary lifetime privilege without remuneration. They do not necessarily perform research or reside at the Academia Sinica campus. According to their own expertise, academicians are grouped into three divisions: Mathematics and Physical Sciences, Life Sciences, and Social Sciences and Humanities. A maximum number of ten new members is allocated to each of the three divisions during the biennial convocation. The eligibility of the academicians is not restricted to the residents of Taiwan or Republic of China citizens. More than half of the academicians are overseas scholars and scientists.

At the convocation, the academicians elect new academicians and honorary academicians, and elect members to the Council of Academia Sinica. The convocation can also recommend policies to the government on academic research. The academicians also have responsibilities to carry out research at the government&#x27;s request, although the government has never requested any task.

==Academicians==

Academicians are elected every two years, with nominations open in July and ending in October. Outcome of election to academicians are publicly announced in July the following year. Election to the academy is regarded a national honor in Taiwan. Up until the 34th convocation of academicians in 2022, any scientist of Chinese descent could be elected a member of Academia Sinica. Starting in 2023, election is to be restricted to citizens of the Republic of China. This change led Academia Sinica to discuss formally classifying non-Taiwanese members as honorary or foreign members. Such a classification system would require amendments to the Organic Act of the Academia Sinica. A group of academicians proposed that membership be further restricted to Taiwan passport or national identification card holders.

<doc id="377862" wikidata="Q1232275" url="?curid=377862" title="Moretonhampstead">
<text>Moretonhampstead is a market town, parish and ancient manor in Devon, situated on the north-eastern edge of Dartmoor, within the Dartmoor National Park. The parish now includes the hamlet of Doccombe (), and it is surrounded clockwise from the north by the parishes of Drewsteignton, Dunsford, Bridford, Bovey Tracey, Lustleigh, North Bovey and Chagford.
According to the 2021 census, it had a population of 1,728, which was slightly more than the 1,703 recorded at the 2011 census. The Moorland electoral ward, in which Moretonhampstead lies, had a population of 2,806 in 2011. The parish church is dedicated to St. Andrew. Along with a few other places in Devon, it is one of the longest place names in England with 16 letters. Moretonhampstead is twinned with Betton in France.

==Toponymy==
The Domesday Book of 1086 records the manor as &quot;MORTONE&quot;. This part of the name derives from the Old English for a town or village in moorland, referring to the town&#x27;s situation on Dartmoor.

In 1493 the town was recorded as &quot;Morton Hampstead&quot; in the Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, with &#x27;ham&#x27; and &#x27;stede&#x27; both being Anglo-Saxon words for a home or enclosed area, but seemingly unnecessary to the historical context of the settlement.

&quot;The Oxford Names Companion&quot; (1991) speculates that this may be a family name, or a nearby place. However &quot;The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names&quot; (2004) simply says the reason for the addition is unknown.

The &#x27;Hampstead&#x27; part of the name was not always used, with the Recovery Rolls from the Court of Common Pleas in 1692 noting it as &quot;Moreton al. Moreton Hampstead&quot;, indicating that both long and short forms may be used. Local noted antiquarian Cecil Torr states that the town continued to be known simply as Moreton to the majority of people prior to the arrival of the railway, which made the station Moretonhampstead in order to distinguish it from other towns called Moreton on the railways network, with 45 other settlements called Moreton or Morton.

==History==
The central region of Devon was occupied by the Saxons sometime after 710. Over time, it was divided into a number of estates, and one of these divisions included all land within the boundaries of the rivers Teign and Bovey, with Moreton as its major settlement.

The present parish of over 6,000 acres (24 km2) is the remainder of an ancient royal estate. It remained a royal estate immediately after the Norman Conquest of 1066, as is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is listed as the 45th of the 72 Devonshire holdings of King William the Conqueror. The manor was held by grand serjeanty from the king by Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster (1259–1326) during the reign of King Edward I (1272–1307), for the annual yielding of one sparrow hawk.

After that time it was the seat of Sir Philip de Courtenay (killed at Stirling 1314), second son of Sir Hugh de Courtenay (died 1292), feudal baron of Okehampton, by his wife Eleanor le Despenser (died 1328), sister of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, and younger brother of Hugh de Courtenay, 1st/9th Earl of Devon (1276–1340) of Tiverton Castle. When he died childless Moretonhampstead was inherited by his elder brother the Earl of Devon, who gave Moretonhampstead to his third son Robert de Courtenay, who made it his seat. Robert&#x27;s grandson William de Courtenay (1377–1388) died childless, and eventually the manor became the property of Sir Philip Courtenay (1340–1406) of Powderham, 5th or 6th son of Hugh Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (1303–1377). Thenceforth it descended with the Powderham estate and, in the time of Pole (died 1635), belonged to Francis Courtenay (1576–1638), &quot;de jure&quot; 4th Earl of Devon.

Wool and (in later years) the manufacture of woollen cloth formed the basis of the town&#x27;s economy for over 700 years. The economy was evidently healthy when Moretonhampstead established a water-powered fulling mill before the end of the 13th century.

In 1207 King John granted a weekly market and an annual five-day fair, indicating that Moretonhampstead had developed into an important local community. The town grew steadily through the Middle Ages and remained prosperous until the end of the 17th century, when the wool industry began to decline. The town continued to be a local trading centre and a rest stop for travellers on the difficult routes across Dartmoor and from Exeter and Newton Abbot.

A series of fires in the 20th century destroyed many of Moretonhampstead&#x27;s ancient buildings, but sufficient still remain to demonstrate the Saxon and medieval heritage, and its later industrial prosperity. Much of the town is a designated conservation area, with many listed buildings being of architectural and historic interest. The whole parish lies within Dartmoor National Park.

===The sparrowhawk===
When King John granted the town its charter during the 13th century, the rent was set as one sparrowhawk per year. The bird has become something of a symbol for the town and is to be incorporated into works of public art under development by an artist in residence, Roger Dean.

===Notable residents===
Rev Dr James Fynes (1695 – 1774), a kinsman of the Dukes of Newcastle, served as Rector from 1735 until his death. Previously Vice-President of Magdalen College, Oxford, he married Elizabeth Bertie but they had no children, and his property in Moretonhampstead was inherited by his nephew, also James Fynes (died 1798).

George Parker Bidder (13 June 1806 – 20 September 1878), known as &quot;the calculating boy&quot;, a calculating prodigy and engineer: the house where he was born burned down in 1926.

==Places of interest==
===The Cross Tree===
The Cross Tree, immortalised by R. D. Blackmore in his 1882 novel &quot;Christowell&quot;, is now only represented by a cross minus its shaft, which is enclosed near the almshouses. This famous dancing tree, a fine old elm, cut and clipped in the form of a punch bowl (by which name it was also known), has long since disappeared, and in its place a beech tree has been planted. It was around the original tree that the village lads and lasses would dance and it recorded that French officers on parole from Dartmoor Prison at Princetown during the Napoleonic Wars, &quot;did assemble around the Cross Tree with their Band&quot;.

===Almshouses===
Standing behind the Cross Tree are the famous almshouses, built in solid granite. The date of 1637 on the outside is actually the date they were refurbished. Recent research has shown that the main core of these buildings are at least two hundred years older. Early in the 19th century the building was converted from two tenements into four and the facade was damaged. By 1938 they had fallen into disrepair. In 1940 they were purchased for the town and converted back into two tenements. In 1952 they were purchased by the National Trust.

===St Andrew&#x27;s Church===
The Grade I listed parish church, dedicated to St. Andrew, is at the eastern end of the town. Its imposing four-stage tower with pentagonal stair-turret was being built by 1418. The entire church is built of granite blocks although the body is roughcast. It has a two-storey porch, battlemented like the tower. Inside, the north and south aisles are separated from the nave by arcades of five bays, constructed of octagonal granite piers. All the windows are of standard Perpendicular design, and according to Pevsner there is &quot;a singular absence of fitments of interest&quot;, due to the heavy restorations the church was subjected to in 1856 and in 1904–5. All the ledger stones were removed with the floor flagstones in the first restoration, but above the south door a wall memorial to Rev Francis Whiddon, MA (died 1656) who &quot;was 32 years minister of this parish&quot; survives. There is also a classical monument by Edward Bowring Stephens to a Captain John Newcombe (died 1855), and a tower screen of wood and glass of 1980.

==Tourism==
Moretonhampstead relies heavily on tourism, and has done so for a long time. Its position makes it a base to explore both Dartmoor and Devon. The central part of the town stands at an altitude of but a short stroll within the parish will elevate the walker to beyond 1,100 feet (340 m) and afford views of the surrounding area. Moretonhampstead has four pubs and three cafes. There is a wide selection of hotels, bed and breakfast, self-catering and camping accommodation.

Moretonhampstead has a good range of sporting facilities and the proximity of Dartmoor makes it popular with ramblers and cyclists, in particular for mountain biking.

<text>Grace Lumpkin (March 3, 1891 – March 23, 1980) was an American writer of proletarian literature who focused most of her works on the Depression era and the rise and fall of communism in the United States. The most important of four books was her first, &quot;To Make My Bread&quot; (1932), which won the Gorky Prize in 1933.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Grace Lumpkin was born on March 3, 1891, in Milledgeville, Georgia, the ninth of eleven children born to Annette Caroline Morris and William Wallace Lumpkin. In 1898 she moved with her family to South Carolina. She grew up in a very religious, prominent but economically-unstable aristocratic Georgian family. There were seven siblings, who by birth order were Elizabeth (teacher), Hope (clergyman), Alva (politician), Morris (lawyer), Grace (writer), and Katharine (academic).

In around 1910, William moved his family one final time, to a farm in Richland County. While in South Carolina, Grace witnessed firsthand the suffering of black and white sharecroppers and laborers. Black laborers performed fieldwork on the Lumpkin family farm, and the Lumpkin children attended school with white children from the &quot;poorest classes&quot;. Just three months after the family began to farm, her father died and the family&#x27;s financial health suffered.

Lumpkin worked at a variety of jobs before graduating from Brenau College in Gainesville, Georgia in 1911. At Brenau, she was a member of Phi Mu and she wrote the author of the Phi Mu Creed. She volunteered in France for a year, and then returned to Georgia. In Georgia she worked for the YMCA, eventually organized an adult night school for farmers and their wives, and worked at home as a demonstration agent. During most of the summers she lived in the mountains of North Carolina, staying with mill workers, sharecroppers, and other laborers, which convinced her that these workers could better their lives only by means of trade unions. Her stay in the mountains introduced her to the families about which she wrote in her first novel.

===Communist years===
Lumpkin had been publishing stories in college and other school magazines since 1908, but it was not until her mother&#x27;s death, in 1925, that she decided to take seriously her career as a writer. Lumpkin moved to New York City when she was twenty-five and began to write short stories, becoming involved in liberal and radical politics. In the fall of 1925 she was hired as a member of the office staff at &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;, one of the best selling magazines in New York. There she met Esther Shemitz, with whom she became lifelong friends. (Shemitz married Whittaker Chambers.) In 1926 she walked the picket lines with Passaic textile strikers and wrote about it for &quot;New Masses.&quot;

In 1927 Lumpkin was arrested at a picket sponsored by the Sacco and Vanzetti Defense Committee. She joined the staff of the New Masses in 1929, where she worked for &quot;about a year and a half.&quot; In 1929 she was sent to the south by the Communist Party to organize among black sharecroppers and to observe and participate in the Communist-led Gastonia textile strikes.

Lumpkin first met Michael Intrator, a close friend of Chambers, who was very involved in the Communist movement, in the late 1920s. She and Intrator eventually became lovers. His expulsion from the Communist Party in 1929 brought a strain to their relationship as Grace remained part of the Communist milieu until the late 1930s. Lumpkin and Intrator married in 1931. The toughest crisis Lumpkin experienced (mid- to late-1930s) was her pregnancy with Intrator&#x27;s child and decision to have an abortion, which she regretted, followed soon afterwards by divorce.

In the 1930s, Lumpkin&#x27;s literary agent was Maxim Lieber, whom Chambers later named as part of his spy ring during that same period. Close to the time of Chambers&#x27; defection from the Soviet underground (April 1938), Lumpkin began rejecting Communist Party functions; soon she became actively anti-Communist.

===Later years===
Lumpkin became concerned with righting what she saw as her earlier political wrong and returned to the teachings of the Bible. She became a frequent speaker in churches and joined the anti-Communist Christians.

On April 2, 1953, Lumpkin testified before the Permanent Subcommittee of Investigations of the Senate Committee on Government Operations. She was then living on Gramercy Park in New York City and working as a proofreader for a printing firm called the Golden Eagle Press. Asked about her affiliations in the 1930s, she replied, &quot;I was under the influence and the discipline of the Communist movement, although I was not a member&quot; and that she had taken part in &quot;faction meetings and cell meetings.&quot;

Asked about why she broke away from the party&#x27;s influence, she described the following incident.

Lumpkin devoted all later writings to criticism of Communism. She continued writing and lecturing and kept her strong tie to the church until death. She died in 1980 in Columbia, South Carolina.

In 2012, Lumpkin is a character in Walt Larimore&#x27;s novels &quot;Hazel Creek&quot; and &quot;Sugar Fork&quot;.

== Works ==

Books:
* To Make My Bread (1932). Tells the story of a family of Appalachian mountaineers who find themselves drawn to a mill town near their family plot after suffering great economic adversity. Soon, all the characters become involved in the politics surrounding the exploitation of labor workers. Lumpkin based her work on the Gastonia textile strike of 1929 at Loray Mill, one of the most important labor strikes in United States history. Also considered an examination of cultural and feminist history during the Depression, Lumpkin&#x27;s novel addresses many of the stratifications between class and race. The novel won the Gorky Prize in 1933.
* A Sign for Cain (1935). The novel follows an African-American protagonist, Dennis, who dreams of organizing workers of all skin colors in order to stand together against business owners and others who wish to control them, regardless of race. &quot;A Sign for Cain&quot; focuses on the struggle between newly freed blacks and their old owners. Issues with sharecropping and land ownership impact both races represented and talk of a social uprising has tones of communist revolution, a theme then emerging more prevalently in Lumpkin&#x27;s own life. Lumpkin realized the influence the Communist Party had over her writing, and even claimed that the strong implications evident in her text were driven by her mentors in the party. Maxim Lieber served as her literary agent in 1935.
* The Wedding (1939). The storyline follows the marriage ceremony of Jennie Middleton, the daughter of an aristocratic family that has ended up in ruin. The novel is set in 1909 and the families involved live strictly by the code of the Confederacy. Jennie&#x27;s groom is Dr. Gregg, a new member of the community, having moved to town due to its rising industrialization. The wedding is almost put on hold after a heated argument and it is only after her mother, father, and Gregg&#x27;s friend act as peacemakers that it continues. Jennie conforms to society&#x27;s demands, having stood her ground for the last time against a marriage in which she has little emotional relation with the doctor.
* Full Circle (1962). Lumpkin&#x27;s final novel explores her changing ideas regarding communism. She uses the case of the Scottsboro Boys, and the characters involved, as an exposé of the &quot;evils of Communism&quot;. The main character, Arnie Braxton, and her mother are slowly tempted into the world of Communist Party politics. Soon the two women find themselves rejecting bourgeois illusions, allowing the sacrilege of a Christ figurine and deserting the rest of their family. Eventually, Arnie is ejected from the Communist Party for racial prejudice. Throughout the text, Lumpkin describes the Communist Party in stark terms and addresses her novel towards Southern issues.

Articles:
* &quot;White Man, A Story&quot; &quot;New Masses&quot; (September 1927)
* &quot;&#x27;Flaming Milka&#x27;s&#x27; Story,&quot; &quot;New Masses&quot; (February 1928)
* &quot;The Law and the Spirit,&quot; &quot;National Review&quot; (May 25, 1957)

== Legacy ==

In 1935, Albert Bein adapted &quot;To Make My Bread&quot; into the play &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot;.

Lumpkin provides modern readers with a window into the past of the building of the southern working class and the changes to its patriarchal values and women&#x27;s roles. Lumpkin&#x27;s writings give cultural historians and scholars an important body to consider when considering this period and the movements to which she contributed.

Beginning in the 1950s, scholars regained interest in radical &quot;lost novels&quot; of the 1930s. They have pointed to Lumpkin as one of the period&#x27;s most influential authors. They have noted both her historical and literary accomplishments, particularly prominent as a figure in the early feminist movement and for promoting worker&#x27;s rights. She has received praise for her ability to portray the process in which &quot;external forces shape a literary work&quot;. she was only 22 when she made her first novel.
Recent literary scholarship has noted Lumpkin&#x27;s ideals of progressive representations of race relations and how she incorporated these into her writings. For example, the characters in &quot;To Make My Bread&quot; illustrate the importance of alliances between white and black women workers, and how these can be based on mutual understanding and need. Lumpkin shows readers that solidarity across racial and economic lines is essential for members of all groups.

Historians during the 1960s and 1970s found particular interest in whether the United States run according to competitive individualism or by cooperation and mutuality. They looked to Lumpkin&#x27;s literature to study this argument.

<text>Slippers are a type of shoes falling under the broader category of light footwear, that are easy to put on and off and are intended to be worn indoors, particularly at home. They provide comfort and protection for the feet when walking indoors.

==History==
The recorded history of slippers can be traced back to the 12th century.
In the West, the record can be traced only to 1478. The English word &quot;slippers&quot; (&quot;sclyppers&quot;) occurs from about 1478.
English speakers formerly also used the related term &quot;&quot; (from the French word ).

Slippers in China date from 4700 BC; they were made of cotton or woven rush, had leather linings, and featured symbols of power, such as dragons. 

Native American moccasins were also highly decorative. Such moccasins depicted nature scenes and were embellished with beadwork and fringing; their soft sure-footedness made them suitable for indoors appropriation. Inuit and Aleut people made shoes from smoked hare-hide to protect their feet against the frozen ground inside their homes.

Fashionable Orientalism saw the introduction into the West of designs like the .

Victorian people needed such shoes to keep dust and gravel outside their homes. For Victorian ladies, slippers gave an opportunity to show off their needlepoint skills and to use embroidery as decoration.

==Types==

Types of slippers include:
*Open-heel slippers – usually made with a fabric upper layer that encloses the top of the foot and the toes, but leaves the heel open. These are often distributed in expensive hotels, included with the cost of the room.
*Closed slippers – slippers with a heel guard that prevents the foot from sliding out.
*Slipper boots – slippers meant to look like boots. Often favored by women, they are typically furry boots with a fleece or soft lining, and a soft rubber sole. Modeled after sheepskin boots, they may be worn outside.
*Sandal slippers – cushioned sandals with soft rubber or fabric soles, similar to Birkenstock&#x27;s cushioned sandals.
* Evening slipper, also known as the &quot;Prince Albert&quot; slipper in reference to Albert, Prince Consort. It is made of velvet with leather soles and features a grosgrain bow or the wearer’s initials embroidered in gold.
Some slippers are made to resemble something other than a slipper and are sold as a novelty item. They are usually made of soft and colorful materials and may come in the shapes of animals, animal paws, vehicles, cartoon characters, and so on.

Not all shoes with a soft, fluffy interior are slippers. Any shoe with a rubber sole and laces is a normal outdoor shoe. In India, rubber chappals (flip-flops) are worn as indoor shoes.

==In popular culture==
The fictional character Cinderella is said to have worn glass slippers; in modern parlance, they would probably be called glass high heels. This motif was introduced in Charles Perrault&#x27;s 1697 version of the fairy tale, &quot;Cendrillon ou la petite pantoufle de verre&quot; (&quot;Cinderella, or the Little Glass Slipper&quot;). For some years it was debated that this detail was a mistranslation and that the slippers in the story were instead made of fur (French: &quot;vair&quot;), but this interpretation has since been discredited by folklorists.

A pair of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; sold at Christie&#x27;s in June 1988 for $165,000. The same pair was resold on May 24, 2000, for $666,000. On both occasions, they were the most expensive shoes from a film to be sold at auction.

In Hawaii and many islands of the Caribbean, the term &quot;slippers&quot;, or &quot;slippahs&quot;, is used to describe flip-flops.

The term &quot;house shoes&quot; (elided into &quot;how-shuze&quot;) is common in the American South.

<text>David Lionel Baddiel (; born 28 May 1964) is an English comedian, presenter, screenwriter, author and singer. He became known for his early work alongside Rob Newman in &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot; and later for his comedy partnership with Frank Skinner.

He has written the children&#x27;s books &quot;The Parent Agency&quot;, &quot;The Person Controller&quot;, &quot;AniMalcolm&quot;, &quot;Birthday Boy&quot;, &quot;Head Kid&quot;, and &quot;The Taylor TurboChaser&quot;. He is also a lyricist on &quot;Three Lions&quot;, a song that has been described as the de facto &quot;anthem&quot; of English football since 1996.

In 2024, he filmed his trilogy of specials &quot;Not The&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre for Sky Arts in February. He also launched his podcast, &quot;A Muslim and a Jew Go There&quot; with Sayeeda Warsi and filmed a travelogue with Hugh Dennis, &quot;Two Men on a Bike&quot; released in 2025.

==Early life==
David Lionel Baddiel was born on 28 May 1964 in Troy, New York, the son of a Welsh-Jewish father and German-Jewish mother. He moved to England with his family when he was four months old. 

Baddiel&#x27;s father, Colin Brian Baddiel, came from a working-class Swansea family and worked as a research chemist with Unilever before being made redundant in the 1980s, after which he sold Dinky Toys at Grays Antique Market. His mother, Sarah, was born in Nazi Germany. She was five months old when she was taken to England by her parents in 1939 after the family had fled Nazi Germany, where her wealthy father had been stripped of his assets as a victim of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. Soon after their arrival in the United Kingdom, her father was interned as an &quot;enemy alien&quot; on the Isle of Man for a year. Baddiel’s grandfather had mental health issues, sometimes requiring hospitalisation, for the rest of his life. Baddiel said in 2022 that he had been parented by his elder brother Ivor, as &quot;my dad was unemployed and angry, while my mum was distracted by her passionate affair&quot;. An episode of the BBC genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; investigated Baddiel&#x27;s heritage in some detail, but failed to prove his theory that his mother had been secretly adopted from another Jewish family who had no hope of escaping. 

Baddiel grew up in the Dollis Hill area of London alongside his two brothers Ivor and Dan (one older, one younger). Ivor is a writer. Baddiel attended the North West London Jewish Day School in Brent, and the public school Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School in Elstree. He studied English at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Cambridge Footlights, and graduated with a double first BA. He began studies for a PhD in English at University College London, but did not complete it.

==Career==
===&quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot; and &quot;Newman and Baddiel&quot;===
After leaving university, Baddiel became a professional stand-up comedian in London, as well as a writer for acts such as Rory Bremner and series including &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. His first television appearance came in one episode of the showbiz satire &quot;Filthy Rich and Catflap&quot;. In 1988 he was introduced to Rob Newman, and the two formed a writing partnership. Subsequently, paired up with Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis, another comedy duo, they began writing and performing in &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot; on BBC Radio 1, where the show ran for four series and a special. This success led the show to transfer to BBC2, where it ran for two series, after which both duos decided to end the show. During this time, Baddiel also co-hosted the Channel 4 programme &quot;A Stab in the Dark&quot;.

After &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;, Baddiel and Newman re-teamed up for &quot;Newman and Baddiel in Pieces&quot;, which ran for seven episodes on BBC2, featuring character sketches, monologues, and observation routines. Despite a fraught working relationship, the show saw Newman and Baddiel find enormous success as live performers, held up as examples of comedy as ‘the new rock ’n’ roll’, with their tour (&quot;Newman and Baddiel: Live and In Pieces&quot;) culminating in the first-ever sold-out gig for a comedy act at Wembley Arena, playing to 12,500 people. Despite this success, increasing tension between the pair led to them announcing the tour would be their last together. Their final tour was the subject of a BBC2 documentary, &quot;Newman and Baddiel on the Road to Wembley&quot;.

===Collaboration with Frank Skinner===
Baddiel subsequently met and began sharing a flat with fellow comedian Frank Skinner. Both lifelong football fans (Baddiel is a Chelsea F.C. fan), the pair created, wrote and performed &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;, a popular entertainment show based on fantasy football. Running for three series on BBC2, followed by a series of live specials throughout the 1998 World Cup and then again through the 2004 European Championship, as well as a series of podcasts for &quot;The Times&quot; from Germany at the 2006 World Cup, and another series for Absolute Radio from South Africa during the 2010 World Cup (amassing over three million downloads). During this time the duo also twice topped the UK Singles Chart with the football anthem &quot;Three Lions&quot;, co-written and performed with The Lightning Seeds.

The song was originally written as the England football team&#x27;s official anthem for UEFA Euro 1996 and was re-recorded with updated lyrics as the unofficial anthem for the 1998 World Cup. The song continues to be popular with England fans and returned to the charts in July 2018, celebrating the progress of the England national football team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup with the phrase &quot;it&#x27;s coming home&quot; featuring heavily on social media and television.

Baddiel received criticism for his impression of black footballer Jason Lee in &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;, which involved him wearing a pineapple on his head and using blackface. Lee said he considered this a form of bullying. Baddiel has issued a number of apologies on social media and in an article for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, saying it was &quot;part of a very bad racist tradition&quot;. Lee said in 2020 that he had not received a direct apology from Baddiel or Skinner over the series of sketches, but in 2022, Baddiel met Lee to apologise in his Channel 4 documentary.

In his 2021 book &quot;Jews Don&#x27;t Count&quot;, Baddiel said that, despite apologizing for the Jason Lee impression &quot;on various occasions&quot;, people, particularly on social media, continued to share it in order to silence him:

:They want me to shut up, particularly about anti-Semitism. As far as they are concerned, the photo of me as Jason Lee is a trump card that means I cannot speak about racism, even the racism that threatens me personally.
After ending &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;, the pair took an improvised question-and-answer show to the Edinburgh Fringe which then became a television series, &quot;Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned&quot;, which ran for five series on ITV, as well as a West End run at the Shaftesbury Theatre in 2001.
The pair also appeared on a celebrity special of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; in 2001, becoming the first celebrity contestants to reach £250,000 for their charities, the &quot;Catholic Children&#x27;s Society&quot; and the &quot;Imperial Cancer Research Fund&quot;.

In February 2022, a clip emerged from Baddiel&#x27;s 2004 guest appearance on &quot;The Frank Skinner Show&quot;. In the clip, Baddiel uses &quot;pikey&quot;, a pejorative term used to refer to people who are of a Traveller community, to negatively denote his own appearance. Critics accused Baddiel of hypocrisy given his own polemic, &quot;Jews Don&#x27;t Count&quot;.

===Solo work===
Baddiel has written four novels: &quot;Time for Bed&quot; (1996), &quot;Whatever Love Means&quot; (2002), &quot;The Secret Purposes&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Death of Eli Gold&quot; (2011). In June 2015, he published his first children&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Parent Agency&quot;, which won the &quot;LOLLIE&quot; award (the successor to the &quot;Roald Dahl Funny Book Awards&quot;) for &quot;Best Laugh Out Loud Book for 9–13-Year-Olds&quot; and is set to be developed into a feature film (also written and produced by Baddiel) through Fox 2000 Pictures. His subsequent children&#x27;s novels include &quot;The Person Controller&quot; (2015), &quot;AniMalcolm&quot; (2016), &quot;Birthday Boy&quot; (2017) and &quot;Head Kid&quot; (2018). He wrote &quot;The Boy Who Could Do What He Liked&quot;, a short story published for World Book Day in 2016. 
In 2001, Baddiel wrote and starred in &quot;Baddiel&#x27;s Syndrome&quot;, a sitcom for Sky One which also starred Morwenna Banks, Stephen Fry and Jonathan Bailey, which ran for fourteen episodes. He also wrote the comedy film, &quot;The Infidel&quot;, starring Omid Djalili, Richard Schiff, Matt Lucas and Miranda Hart. Baddiel has since adapted the film into a musical with music by Erran Baron Cohen. Baddiel directed the production which ran at London&#x27;s Theatre Royal Stratford East in late 2014. Baddiel&#x27;s other writing credits include &quot;The Norris McWhirter Chronicles&quot; for Sky 1, which starred Alistair McGowan and John Thomson and which Baddiel also directed, and two episodes of the ITV reboot of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go!&quot;
In 2004, Baddiel created and hosted &quot;Heresy&quot;, a BBC Radio 4 panel show which sees celebrity guests trying to overthrow popular prejudice and received wisdom. The show is currently in its 10th series and has been hosted by Victoria Coren since 2008, with Baddiel returning regularly as a guest. In 2014 Baddiel created and hosted &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Laugh&quot;, a new panel show for Radio 4 that tasks guests with talking for as long as possible on obviously humorous subjects without getting laughs. The second series aired in 2016. In 2015, he created and fronted &quot;David Baddiel Tries to Understand...&quot;, a BBC Radio 4 show which sees Baddiel try to understand famously complex subjects as suggested by his followers on Twitter, and has now run for three series.
Baddiel has appeared in shows including &quot;Little Britain&quot;, &quot;Skins&quot;, &quot;The Life of Rock with Brian Pern&quot; and &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; and is a regular guest on panel shows including &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown&quot;, &quot;QI&quot; and Alan Davies’ &quot;As Yet Untitled&quot;. In 2016, he fronted a four-part travel documentary for Discovery entitled &quot;David Baddiel On the Silk Road&quot;, a 4,000-mile journey to explore the most famous trade route in history, as well as presenting two episodes of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Artsnight&quot; and becoming a regular presenter of &quot;The Penguin Podcast&quot; in which he interviews authors about the objects that inspired their books, which has seen him interview guests including Johnny Marr, Zadie Smith and Ruby Wax. Other documentaries he has fronted include &quot;Baddiel and the Missing Nazi Billions&quot; (BBC2), &quot;Who Do You Want Your Child to Be?&quot; (BBC2), &quot;World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Roads&quot; (BBC2), and an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; (BBC1). He appeared on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 2018.

Baddiel filmed a documentary about his father&#x27;s dementia, &quot;The Trouble with Dad&quot;, shown on Channel 4 in 2017.

In 2019 Baddiel featured in &quot;Taskmaster&quot; series 9. He won one episode and finished fifth out of five in the overall series.

In January 2021, it was announced Baddiel would appear as a contestant on the 4th series of &quot;The Great Stand Up to Cancer Bake Off&quot;, which aired in Spring 2021.

===Stand-up===
In 2013, he returned to stand-up comedy with his critically acclaimed show &quot;Fame (Not the Musical)&quot;, which ran at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe before transferring to London&#x27;s Menier Chocolate Factory and a subsequent nationwide tour. In Spring 2016 Baddiel premiered a new show, &quot;My Family: Not the Sitcom&quot;, again at the Menier Chocolate Factory; the confessional show tells the true story of Baddiel&#x27;s recently deceased mother and dementia-suffering father.

Following a five-week run, the show transferred to London&#x27;s West End in September 2016 for another five-week run at the Vaudeville Theatre. In spring 2017 it was announced that the show would return to the West End for one final ten-week run at the &quot;Playhouse Theatre&quot; in March 2017. In the same month, it was announced that the show was nominated for an Olivier Award, in The Entertainment and Family category. Rob Newman saw one of these performances, the first time the two had been in the same room since 1993. The show was performed as part of the Montreal Comedy Festival in 2017 and will tour the UK in 2018. Most recently, Baddiel took the show to a four-city tour of Australia. His new show about social media, &quot;Trolls: Not The Dolls&quot;, toured the UK in 2020.

===Plays and books===
In October 2019 Baddiel&#x27;s play &quot;God&#x27;s Dice&quot; was produced at the Soho Theatre, London. The title is an allusion to Einstein&#x27;s view of quantum uncertainty: &quot;God does not play dice with the universe&quot;. The work deals with &quot;an ageing [quantum physicist] seduced into supporting a radical religious sect&quot;.

Baddiel has written books for both adults and children and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2019.

=== TV at Channel 4 ===
In November 2022 Baddiel fronted a Channel 4 documentary &quot;David Baddiel: Jews Don&#x27;t Count&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; TV section summed it up as:Baddiel focuses on the ideas that formed his 2021 book of the same title. His central thesis is that “Jews don’t count as a proper minority” when it comes to contemporary notions of prejudice and racism. He sets out to explore why so many people seem to ignore antisemitism, as well as “the dysfunction between progressives and Jews&quot;.The &quot;Financial Times&quot; review remarked:That Baddiel and Channel 4 have already received a torrent of scorn online for making the programme only serves to highlight its importance.

==Other interests==
===Politics===
Baddiel is a Labour Party voter, but does not describe himself as a &quot;Labour supporter&quot;. He has said, &quot;I would never support a political party like that, regardless of what I believe personally. My job is to be funny and that might involve me being funny at the expense of whoever&#x27;s stepped in shit that week.&quot;

In February 2016, Baddiel commented on the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader: &quot;I think it&#x27;s interesting to think that we&#x27;ve got a proper left-wing Labour politician. My main thing about Corbyn is I think the scaremongering about him by the right-wing press is so absurd it makes me want to support Corbyn, even though in some ways I might not. Some of the people around him I personally wouldn&#x27;t trust but I think he himself is a decent man.&quot;

In April 2017, Baddiel wrote an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in which he was critical of Ken Livingstone&#x27;s comments regarding Adolf Hitler and Zionism, but also made it clear that he was not a Zionist and that he disagreed with &quot;religion being the basis for statehood&quot; and what he called &quot;the appalling actions of the present Israeli government&quot;.

In March 2018, Baddiel appeared on &quot;Daily Politics&quot;, in which he described antisemitism as &quot;sort of invisible&quot; to Corbyn and others on the political left because they are focused on &quot;fighting the good fight against capitalism&quot;. 

In February 2020, he told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Holocaust denial is &quot;a direct way of saying Jews are liars, Jews have tricked the world for their own gain, Jews are the most evil, pernicious race that exist&quot;. He further said, &quot;It is hate speech. There&#x27;s no other conclusion.”

In February 2021, Baddiel&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;Jews Don&#x27;t Count&quot; was published by &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. The book asserts that double standards are extensively employed (either knowingly or unknowingly) by anti-racists when dealing with antisemitism, stating that &quot;a sacred circle is drawn around those whom the progressive modern left are prepared to go into battle for, and it seems as if the Jews aren&#x27;t in it&quot;. Much of the book consists of examples which the author argues are evidence that such progressives have a blind spot when it comes to antisemitism.

In 2024, Baddiel launched his acclaimed podcast &quot;A Muslim and a Jew Go There&quot; with Sayeeda Warsi.

===Charity===
Baddiel is a patron of Humanists UK and the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM). He acted as compere for the &quot;Stand-Up to Stop Suicide&quot; event organised by Claire Anstey and the charity, and has appeared on radio advertisements publicising the issue of young male suicide.

In February 2009, Baddiel and several other entertainers wrote an open letter in &quot;The Times&quot; supporting leaders of the Baháʼí Faith who were then on trial in Iran. Following his experiences with his father, Baddiel has worked closely with a number of charities supporting the victims of dementia and their families. He performed a special one-off charity gala of his &quot;My Family: Not the Sitcom&quot; show at the Vaudeville Theatre, with all proceeds from the evening being split between the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society, the National Brain Appeal, and the Unforgettable Foundation. There were also collections made for the charities throughout the run of the show.

In 2017, it was announced that Baddiel would take part in Comic Relief&#x27;s &quot;Red Nose Convoy&quot;, in which three pairs of celebrities travel in convoy from Kenya to Uganda while delivering aid. To benefit the cancer charity CLIC Sargent, Baddiel narrated the 2018 short film &quot;To Trend on Twitter&quot; with fellow comedians Reece Shearsmith, Steve Pemberton, and Helen Lederer, and actor Jason Flemyng. In March 2019, Baddiel hosted &quot;Comic Relief Does University Challenge&quot; on BBC One as part of Red Nose Day.

==Personal life==
Baddiel has been in a relationship since 1998 with fellow comedian Morwenna Banks, and they married in 2017. They currently live in North London with their two children: a daughter named Dolly (b. 2001) and a son named Ezra (b. 2004). Despite his upbringing, he has described himself as a &quot;10 out of 10 atheist&quot; and as a &quot;fundamentalist&quot; Jewish atheist. He suffers from insomnia, about which he has written guest articles.

Baddiel is an avid fan of the rock band Genesis and introduced them at their Turn It On Again: The Tour press conference in 2006. He also provided sleeve notes for the reissue of the album &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; as part of the &quot;Genesis 1970–1975&quot; boxed set. He is a fan of the band&#x27;s former lead singer Peter Gabriel, and a diarist for &quot;The Times&quot; once incorrectly reported that he had been &quot;loud and offensive&quot; while attending one of Gabriel&#x27;s concerts, misidentifying musician Ian Broudie, something Baddiel has referred to in his live act. He is also a fan of David Bowie and marked Bowie&#x27;s 65th birthday in 2012 by expressing a desire to see him come out of retirement. He attended the tribute concert to Bowie at London&#x27;s Union Chapel following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016 and addressed the audience, describing Bowie as &quot;the greatest tunesmith we have&quot;.

<doc id="377872" wikidata="Q4738319" url="?curid=377872" title="Alviso, San Jose">
<text>Alviso is a district of San Jose, California, located in North San Jose on the southern shores of San Francisco Bay. Originally an independent town, founded in 1852, today Alviso is San Jose&#x27;s only waterfront district, primarily residential in nature, with several Silicon Valley tech companies and recreation-oriented businesses. Alviso is named after 19th-century Californio ranchero Ignacio Alviso, who owned the area as part of his Rancho Rincón de Los Esteros.

The Guadalupe River separates Alviso from Santa Clara and Sunnyvale to the west, while Coyote Creek separates Alviso from Milpitas to the east. Alviso is the lowest point in the San Francisco Bay Area at below sea level.

== History ==
Alviso was first settled in the 18th century. The community was named for Ignacio Alviso, the son of Corporal Domingo Alviso, one of the original members of the de Anza expedition. Corporal Alviso lived but a short time after reaching San Francisco and was buried March 11, 1777. Alviso&#x27;s descendants were granted the Rancho Rincón de los Esteros holding. In 1840 Ignacio Alviso moved from Mission Santa Clara de Asís to this ranchero. From this port, beaver pelts, cattle hides and tallow went to San Francisco.

The city of Alviso was incorporated and became the first chartered city in the State of California on March 26, 1852, as the boating and shipping port of San José and the transportation hub for the Santa Clara Valley to the San Francisco Bay. Steamboats traveled regularly between San Francisco and Alviso. That usage declined with the growth in railroad transportation between San Francisco and San José. In 1864 Alviso was bypassed by the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad, (later part of the Southern Pacific Railroad). However, in the 1880s Alviso was a stop on the Newark line of Southern Pacific Railroad between San José and Oakland.

Alviso was the home to a series of several successful business ventures. Alviso Mills, founded in 1853, at its peak produced up to 300 barrels of flour a day. As wheat production in the San Joaquín Valley grew, production in the Santa Clara Valley waned and the Alviso Mills closed in 1885. In 1906, Sai Yin Chew opened the Bayside Canning Company there, and at its peak, under his son Thomas Foon Chew, was the 3rd largest cannery in the United States. During The Depression Alviso was known for its dance halls and gambling establishments. In the 1960s and 1970s a small independent boat building community developed there.

The city ceased to exist when it was consolidated with the City of San Jose on March 12, 1968, following a 189 to 180 vote in favor of consolidation. The city&#x27;s final census was in 1960 when it recorded a population of 1,174. The United States Postal Service still recognizes &quot;Alviso&quot; as a place name. Mail is not delivered in Alviso, but must be picked up at the post office.

After the 1970s, Alviso was treated like a socioeconomic backwater of the prospering Silicon Valley business community and struggled to restore its former vitality. On October 9, 1973, were added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Santa Clara County, California as site 73000449 under the name Alviso Historic District. The listing cited 11 historic structures and alternative name Embarcadero de Santa Clara, although exact boundaries were not disclosed. The floods of the early 1980s were devastating to Alviso, especially because Alviso is below sea level and is on marshland. Water was as much as 10 feet (3 m) deep in some locations. A number of homes and businesses were destroyed. Some of the picturesque character of the town was lost.

Shipping and industry have left Alviso, leaving it mostly as a small residential neighborhood. Digital video recorder company TiVo and Polycom have their corporate headquarters in Alviso. Many salt evaporation ponds formerly owned by Cargill in the neighborhood are being converted to wetlands as part of the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge.

Throughout the 20th century, Alviso was victim to severe flooding, most recently in 1983 and 1995.

As of 2021, Amtrak trains and the Altamont Commuter Express still cross through Alviso on the Coast Line (Union Pacific Railroad).

== Demographics ==
===2020===
The 2020 census reported that Alviso had a population of 2,251. With a total of 558 households with an average size of 4.03 people and 428 families. The racial makeup of Alviso was 539 (23.9%) White, 316 (14.0%) Asian (4.9% Indian, 3.5% Vietnamese 3.3% Chinese and 1.1% Filipino), 38 (1.7%) Native American, 1,200 (53.3%) from other races, and 109 (4.8%) from two or more races. There were 1,374 residents of Hispanic or Latino background (61%). 59.6% of the neighborhood&#x27;s population was of Mexican descent.

===2000 census===
The U.S. Census Bureau provides demographic information for the 95002 ZIP Code Tabulation Area, which includes the former City of Alviso. (See map of the 95002 Zip Code Tabulation Area.) As of the census of 2000, there were 2,128 people, 506 households, and 400 families residing in the CDP. There were 514 housing units.

The racial makeup of the CDP was 40.8% White, 0.6% African American, 1.1% Native American, 2.7% Asian, 50.5% from other races, and 4.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 75.4% of the population.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $87,679, and the median income for a family was $105,827. Males had a median income of $58,750 versus $56,875 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $62,452. About 3.8% of families and 5.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.8% of those under the age of eighteen and 10.4% of those sixty five or over.

==Attractions==
===Alviso Marina County Park===
This bayside park, though small in size, offers a great deal of activities within its boundaries and on into the Wildlife Refuge. The first phase of improvements, which included construction of a boardwalk, trails, observation deck, signage, picnic areas, and improvements to the parking lot, was completed in 2005. A second phase, completed in 2010, added new boat launch ramps, a parking lot for boat trailers, and wetland mitigation areas. Both the pathways and boardwalks of the County Park and trails around the ponds in the adjacent Wildlife Refuge offer fantastic views of the mountains surrounding the bay, and of the wildlife that call these ponds home.

Dogs are allowed in the County Park&#x27;s pathways and picnic areas, but are not allowed on the trails, levees and boardwalks. Bicycles are allowed on all pathways and trails in the park, but should be walked when on the boardwalks. The launch ramp provides one of the few clear routes in the San Jose area through the salt marshes out to the open waters of the San Francisco Bay.

;Day on the Bay
Every year on a Sunday in October Alviso celebrates Day on the Bay, a multicultural event, free for all, sponsored by Santa Clara County. Day on the Bay attracts families with music, food, booths for community organizations, Halloween pumpkins, kayak rides, and other activities.

Day on the Bay began on October 16, 2010, to celebrate the opening of the newly renovated Marina Park. About 5,000 people were in attendance from all around the county. The event was created to celebrate the new city attraction but also to attract a diverse crowd to the outdoor recreational setting.

===Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge===

Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, the first urban National Wildlife Refuge established in the United States, is dedicated to preserving and enhancing wildlife habitat, protecting migratory birds, protecting threatened and endangered species, and providing opportunities for wildlife-oriented recreation and nature study for the surrounding communities.

As of 2004, the Refuge spans of open bay, salt pond, salt marsh, mudflat, upland and vernal pool habitats located throughout south San Francisco Bay. Located along the Pacific Flyway, the Refuge hosts over 280 species of birds each year. Millions of shorebirds and waterfowl stop to refuel at the Refuge during the spring and fall migration. In addition to its seasonal visitors, the Refuge provides critical habitat to resident species like the endangered Ridgway&#x27;s rail and salt marsh harvest mouse.

The Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge is part of a complex made up of six other wildlife refuges in the San Francisco Bay Area. Founded in 1974 and administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, It was renamed Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in 1995 in recognition of Congressman Don Edwards&#x27; efforts to protect sensitive wetlands in south San Francisco Bay.

==Landmarks==
===Bayside Cannery===
The Bayside Cannery is a historic Mission Revival style building in Alviso, built in 1906. Originally founded as the Precita Canning Co. in San Francisco, the cannery moved to Alviso following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Bayside Cannery grew to be the third largest canning company in the world, after Del Monte and Libby Cannery. It was closed in 1936 and the property is currently used by the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory.

===Laine Store===
The Laine Store at 996 Elizabeth Street was run by the Tilden family from 1865 to 1912. In the 1920s it became a Chinese gambling hall. After the 1983 flood, the store was abandoned and fell into disrepair. In 2017 it collapsed and the debris was removed.

===Tilden–Laine House===
An Italianate–Victorian home built in 1887 by Susan Tilden, and located on Elizabeth Street. The home is still occupied by the Laine family; Thomas Laine and Beverly Laine.

===Wade Warehouse===
The H. G. Wade Warehouse was built in 1860 and used for storage of grain and hay prior to shipment to San Francisco, and also for Wells Fargo horse-drawn carriages. It was a City of San Jose historic landmark. It was destroyed by fire in June 2021.

<doc id="377876" wikidata="Q3983322" url="?curid=377876" title="Time of flight">
<text>Time of flight (ToF) is the measurement of the time taken by an object, particle or wave (be it acoustic, electromagnetic, etc.) to travel a distance through a medium. This information can then be used to measure velocity or path length, or as a way to learn about the particle or medium&#x27;s properties (such as composition or flow rate). The traveling object may be detected directly (direct time of flight, dToF, e.g., via an ion detector in mass spectrometry) or indirectly (indirect time of flight, iToF, e.g., by light scattered from an object in laser doppler velocimetry). Time of flight technology has found valuable applications in the monitoring and characterization of material and biomaterials, hydrogels included.

==Overview==
In electronics, one of the earliest devices using the principle are ultrasonic distance-measuring devices, which emit an ultrasonic pulse and are able to measure the distance to a solid object based on the time taken for the wave to bounce back to the emitter. The ToF method is also used to estimate the electron mobility. Originally, it was designed for measurement of low-conductive thin films, later adjusted for common semiconductors. This experimental technique is used for metal-dielectric-metal structures as well as organic field-effect transistors. The excess charges are generated by application of the laser or voltage pulse.
For magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), ToF is a major underlying method. In this method, blood entering the imaged area is not yet saturated, giving it a much higher signal when using short echo time and flow compensation. It can be used in the detection of aneurysm, stenosis or dissection.

In time-of-flight mass spectrometry, ions are accelerated by an electrical field to the same kinetic energy with the velocity of the ion depending on the mass-to-charge ratio. Thus the time-of-flight is used to measure velocity, from which the mass-to-charge ratio can be determined. The time-of-flight of electrons is used to measure their kinetic energy.

In near-infrared spectroscopy, the ToF method is used to measure the media-dependent optical pathlength over a range of optical wavelengths, from which composition and properties of the media can be analyzed.

In ultrasonic flow meter measurement, ToF is used to measure speed of signal propagation upstream and downstream of flow of a media, in order to estimate total flow velocity. This measurement is made in a collinear direction with the flow.

In planar Doppler velocimetry (optical flow meter measurement), ToF measurements are made perpendicular to the flow by timing when individual particles cross two or more locations along the flow (collinear measurements would require generally high flow velocities and extremely narrow-band optical filters).

In optical interferometry, the pathlength difference between sample and reference arms can be measured by ToF methods, such as frequency modulation followed by phase shift measurement or cross correlation of signals. Such methods are used in laser radar and laser tracker systems for medium-long range distance measurement.

In neutron time-of-flight scattering, a pulsed monochromatic neutron beam is scattered by a sample. The energy spectrum of the scattered neutrons is measured via time of flight.

In kinematics, ToF is the duration in which a projectile is traveling through the air. Given the initial velocity formula_1 of a particle launched from the ground, the downward (i.e. gravitational) acceleration formula_2, and the projectile&#x27;s angle of projection &quot;θ&quot; (measured relative to the horizontal), then a simple rearrangement of the SUVAT equation

:formula_3

results in this equation

:formula_4

for the time of flight of a projectile.

== In mass spectrometry ==
The time-of-flight principle can be applied for mass spectrometry. Ions are accelerated by an electric field of known strength. This acceleration results in an ion having the same kinetic energy as any other ion that has the same charge. The velocity of the ion depends on the mass-to-charge ratio. The time that it subsequently takes for the particle to reach a detector at a known distance is measured. This time will depend on the mass-to-charge ratio of the particle (heavier particles reach lower speeds). From this time and the known experimental parameters one can find the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion. The elapsed time from the instant a particle leaves a source to the instant it reaches a detector.

== In flow meters ==
An ultrasonic flow meter measures the velocity of a liquid or gas through a pipe using acoustic sensors. This has some advantages over other measurement techniques. The results are slightly affected by temperature, density or conductivity. Maintenance is inexpensive because there are no moving parts.
Ultrasonic flow meters come in three different types: transmission (contrapropagating transit time) flowmeters, reflection (Doppler) flowmeters, and open-channel flowmeters. Transit time flowmeters work by measuring the time difference between an ultrasonic pulse sent in the flow direction and an ultrasound pulse sent opposite the flow direction. Doppler flowmeters measure the doppler shift resulting in reflecting an ultrasonic beam off either small particles in the fluid, air bubbles in the fluid, or the flowing fluid&#x27;s turbulence. Open channel flow meters measure upstream levels in front of flumes or weirs.

Optical time-of-flight sensors consist of two light beams projected into the fluid whose detection is either interrupted or instigated by the passage of small particles (which are assumed to be following the flow). This is not dissimilar from the optical beams used as safety devices in motorized garage doors or as triggers in alarm systems. The speed of the particles is calculated by knowing the spacing between the two beams. If there is only one detector, then the time difference can be measured via autocorrelation. If there are two detectors, one for each beam, then direction can also be known. Since the location of the beams is relatively easy to determine, the precision of the measurement depends primarily on how small the setup can be made. If the beams are too far apart, the flow could change substantially between them, thus the measurement becomes an average over that space. Moreover, multiple particles could reside between them at any given time, and this would corrupt the signal since the particles are indistinguishable. For such a sensor to provide valid data, it must be small relative to the scale of the flow and the seeding density. MOEMS approaches yield extremely small packages, making such sensors applicable in a variety of situations.

Usually the time-of-flight tube used in mass spectrometry is praised for simplicity, but for precision measurements of charged low energy particles the electric and the magnetic field in the tube has to be controlled within 10 mV and 1 nT respectively.

The work function homogeneity of the tube can be controlled by a Kelvin probe. The magnetic field can be measured by a fluxgate compass. High frequencies are passively shielded and damped by radar absorbent material. To generate arbitrary low frequencies field the screen is parted into plates (overlapping and connected by capacitors) with bias voltage on each plate and a bias current on coil behind plate whose flux is closed by an outer core. In this way the tube can be configured to act as a weak achromatic quadrupole lens with an aperture with a grid and a delay line detector in the diffraction plane to do angle resolved measurements. Changing the field the angle of the field of view can be changed and a deflecting bias can be superimposed to scan through all angles.

When no delay line detector is used focusing the ions onto a detector can be accomplished through the use of two or three einzel lenses placed in the vacuum tube located between the ion source and the detector.

The sample should be immersed into the tube with holes and apertures for and against stray light to do magnetic experiments and to control the electrons from their start.

More recently from 2013 to 2015, she played the title character on the Nick Jr. Channel TV show &quot;Julius Jr.&quot;, and was recently Hinoka from &quot;Fire Emblem Fates&quot;.

===Live-action roles===
Besides doing voice-overs, Daily has acted in film and on TV. She played Sandy Burns on the PBS series &quot;The Righteous Apples&quot; from 1980 to 1981. In the mid-1980s, she starred as Dottie in &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, as Loryn in &quot;Valley Girl,&quot; and as a singer in the comedy &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;. She also appeared on such television shows as &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;. She was also in the music video for Rod Stewart&#x27;s song &quot;Young Turks&quot; as Patti, one of the runaway teens. She has been cast in several Rob Zombie films, most recently in 2015 as Sex-Head in Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;31&quot;, the woman on the side of Torsten Voges, who plays Death-Head.

===Music===
Daily signed with A&amp;M Records in 1985, working with Madonna&#x27;s frequent collaborators John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez and Stephen Bray. In 1986, that label released the R&amp;B/Rock single &quot;Say It, Say It&quot;. The song made it to No. 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the No. 1 spot on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. (Other versions of the song appeared as early as 1981). Her songs &quot;Shake It Up&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Hot Tonight&quot; were included in the soundtrack to the film &quot;Scarface&quot;. Those same songs were later included in the lineup of fictional radio station Flashback 95.6 FM in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; video game. They were also included in the &quot;&quot; video game, based on the 1983 film. Her hit &quot;Love in the Shadows&quot; was featured in the films &quot;Thief of Hearts&quot; and &quot;Circuit&quot;.

Also in 1985, she provided backup vocals for The Human League frontman Philip Oakey&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Philip Oakey &amp; Giorgio Moroder&quot;. That same year, she appeared in the comedy film &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, singing the songs &quot;One Way Love (Better Off Dead)&quot; and &quot;A Little Luck&quot; as a member of a band performing at a high school dance. Both songs were included on the soundtrack album credited to E. G. Daily. She performed a song on &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; soundtrack called &quot;Waiting&quot;.

In 1987, she released the song &quot;Mind over Matter&quot;, which is featured in the film &quot;Summer School&quot;. Daily plays guitar, harmonica, keyboards, and percussion instruments. In her 1989 song, &quot;Some People&quot;, from her &quot;Lace Around the Wound&quot; album, produced by Lotti Golden and Tommy Faragher, she plays guitar and harmonica. In 1999, she released her third studio album &quot;Tearing Down the Walls&quot;.

Daily released a song titled &quot;Changing Faces&quot; in 2003. The song was used on the end credits of &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;. She also released a single titled &quot;Beautiful&quot; which she made available through iTunes on April 29, 2008. She also sang the song &quot;Dawn&#x27;s Theme&quot;, which was used at the end of the movie &quot;Streets&quot;. From 2003 to 2011, Daily did the voice-over of Jake Harper singing the &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; song.

Her genres are country, dance, pop, and rock.

In fall 2013, Daily sang as a contestant on the fifth season of the NBC reality show &quot;The Voice&quot;. In the blind audition broadcast on September 24, 2013, she sang &quot;Breathe&quot; from Faith Hill. Two of the four judges on the show, Blake Shelton and CeeLo Green, turned around their chairs for her. She chose to be on Team Blake. Daily proceeded to win her battle in the show&#x27;s battle rounds singing the song &quot;Something to Talk About&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Rio Hill was a skirmish in the American Civil War in which Union cavalry raided a Confederate camp in Albemarle County, Virginia.

In the early afternoon of February 28, 1864, Union Brig. Gen. George A. Custer and 1,500 Union soldiers advanced towards Charlottesville. This raid was an attempt by the Union to divert attention toward Charlottesville while a separate attempt was made to free prisoners of war being held in Richmond.

Custer&#x27;s orders were to destroy a railroad bridge across the Rivanna River. His only opposition came from Confederate Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s &quot;Horse Company&quot; stationed in a camp near the Rivanna River at Carrsbrook. Custer&#x27;s men raided the camp under fire from Confederate forces commanded by Capt. R. Preston Chew and Captain Marcellus N. Moorman. The Federal troopers looted the camp and set fire to it, after capturing two Confederate soldiers. During the raid, one of the Confederate caissons exploded, and Custer became confused believing that the explosion was actually the reopening of enemy artillery fire. His men fired into each other and then fled from the camp. The Confederate troops regrouped and chased Custer out of Albemarle.

Custer and Philip Sheridan returned to Charlottesville in 1865 and occupied the town from March 3 to March 7, a month before the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered at Appomattox.

==Background==

After the Mine Run Campaign, Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Confederate Army of Northern Virginia set up winter quarters in Orange County. Four batteries of Major General J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s horse artillery battalion encamped in nearby Albemarle County. The artillerymen began constructing winter huts just west of the Earlysville Road about north of Charlottesville, just south of the South Fork of the Rivanna River and Rio Mills. After the harsh campaigning of 1863, the Confederate gunners rested easily in their camp through the early weeks of 1864.

Northern forces, however, were busily at work. In early 1864, Union commanders devised a multi-objective raid on the Confederate capital of Richmond. While Judson Kilpatrick led the raid on Richmond (which included the infamous Dahlgren Affair), Brigadier General George A. Custer was tasked with leading a diversionary raid into Albemarle County. Charlottesville had long been a Union target. Custer&#x27;s mission was twofold: Destroy Confederate supplies stockpiled in Charlottesville and destroy the Virginia Central Railroad bridge just east of town over the Rivanna River (the Railroad had longed served as a pipeline of supplies from the Shenandoah Valley to Lee&#x27;s army). Custer was detached several regiments from different divisions and set out with his hodgepodge force from Mount Pony at 2:00 PM on February 28.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===
Custer&#x27;s force of about 1,500 men contained cavalry regiments from at least two divisions of the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s Cavalry Corps, and a section of Parrott rifles from Battery E, 1st U.S. Artillery under First Lieutenant David Essex Porter to provide artillery support.

===Confederate===
The only cohesive Confederate forces in the immediate area of Custer&#x27;s targets were the four batteries of Stuart&#x27;s horse artillery encamped on Rio Hill, directly in Custer&#x27;s intended path. The four batteries, of four guns each, were commanded by Captain Marcellus Newton Moorman, Captain Roger Preston Chew, Captain James Breathed, and Captain William Morrell McGregory. Moorman, as senior officer, served as acting commander for the entire battalion. The 16 cannons were manned by approximately 200 Confederate artillerymen.

==Preparations for battle==
After departing from Mount Pony at 2:00 PM on February 28, Custer&#x27;s men arrived at Madison Court House at about 6:00 PM that evening. Custer rested his men for the evening; at 2:00 AM the next morning, Custer&#x27;s men continued towards Stanardsville. Not long after departing, Custer&#x27;s men drove off Confederate pickets along the road. Upon arriving at Stanardsville, Custer&#x27;s men drove off a score of mounted Confederate vedettes in the direction of Orange Court House. Custer&#x27;s men continued to Earlysville; along the way, they learned from captured Confederate soldiers and sympathizers that Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry division was encamped near Charlottesville (a fabrication and exaggeration of the Confederates&#x27; real strength).

Moorman and his men were entirely unaware of the approaching Union column until about 12:30 PM, when a lieutenant in the 1st Virginia Cavalry reported that enemy cavalry had been detected south of Stanardsville and were moving towards Moorman&#x27;s encampment. Moorman dispatched pickets to guard the bridge across the Rivanna at Rio Mills, but the pickets discovered the fast-moving Federal column had already seized the crossing point. There is some speculation that Moorman initially did not believe the report of approaching Federal cavalry; he received the warning at 12:30 PM, yet his pickets insisted that Rio Mills Bridge was occupied by Union forces when they arrived. Since Custer&#x27;s men did not reach the bridge until 3:00 PM and Moorman&#x27;s pickets had only to travel from their camp to the bridge, it seems probable that Moorman was initially reluctant to accept the warning or lethargic in carrying out preparations.

==Battle==
One of Custer&#x27;s officers recalled that just as the Union cavalry began crossing the bridge over the Rivanna at Rio Mills, four trains were heard moving into Charlottesville. It was assumed that this signified Confederate reinforcements arriving in Charlottesville. Moving quickly, Custer dispatched Captain Joseph P. Ash with sixty men of the 5th U.S. Cavalry to cross about a mile downstream at Cook&#x27;s Ford to attack the Confederate camp from the east and south while Custer&#x27;s main force attacked from the north and west.

Even with the warning given almost two and half hours before Custer&#x27;s men crossed the bridge, Moorman&#x27;s men were apparently still largely unprepared to defend their camp. To buy time, Moorman ordered several pieces from each battery to engage Custer&#x27;s main force advancing down the Earlysville Road while the rest of his cannon limbered up and withdrew to safety. After the first half of his cannon were limbered up and withdrawn from immediate danger, the rest of the cannons were hitched up and pulled out of the camp as Custer&#x27;s main body reached the camp&#x27;s northern outskirts. At the same time, Captain Ash&#x27;s squadrons, having completed their crossing at Cook&#x27;s Ford, rode towards the Confederate camp from the east. Desperate for more time, Moorman ordered four cannons deployed into battery on a ridge just south of the camp; as the four guns fired ordnance into their own camp, now swarming with Federal cavalry, a skirmish line was deployed to support the battery. The thin line, armed only with pistols, were tasked with guarding the guns until Moorman could gather forces against Custer&#x27;s horsemen.

Moorman, recognizing the grave nature of the situation, ordered his artillerymen to mount their battery horses and form into line. Splitting the pseudo-cavalrymen into two groups (one under Captain Chew, the other under Captain Breathed), Moorman ordered his men to simulate cavalry reinforcements arriving on the field. Armed with pistols and sticks picked up off the ground, the mounted artillerymen rode about the four guns still firing into the reforming Federals in the camp.

Incredibly, the ruse worked. Custer&#x27;s men stalled at the sight of what was apparently a substantial cavalry reinforcement for the enemy. As they moved forward through the camp, Custer&#x27;s main force ran head-on into Captain Ash&#x27;s detachment, which at that moment was riding into the Confederate camp from the east; surprised and disoriented, the two groups of Union soldiers began firing into one another. Just then, a Confederate caisson, left behind in the Confederate camp, exploded. In the mounting chaos, Custer&#x27;s men withdrew entirely from the camp. Seeing the line of Confederate horsemen arriving on the scene, Custer assumed he was now outnumbered and ordered a retreat across the Rivanna. As his forces withdrew in some confusion into Rio Mills, Federal soldiers burned the bridge over the river behind them to delay the expected Confederate counterattack. After burning the namesake mill in the small community, Custer&#x27;s men withdrew back the way they had come towards Stanardsville. The whole skirmish, from the arrival of Federal forces at the Rivanna bridge to their burning of that structure, lasted barely an hour.

==Aftermath==
At 9:00 PM, still south of Stanardsville, Custer&#x27;s men bivouacked for about an hour and a half. 500 men mistakenly continued their retreat through the night, thus reducing Custer&#x27;s force to 1,000 men. The next morning, March 1, Custer&#x27;s men engaged Confederate forces in what became known as the Battle of Stanardsville. After that battle, Custer&#x27;s men withdrew to their original pre-raid positions beyond Madison, arriving there by dusk that evening.

Custer reported of that, over the course of his expedition, his men &quot;marched upwards of , destroyed the bridge over the Rivanna River, burned 3 large flouting mills filled with grain and flour, captured 6 caissons and 2 forges, with harness complete; captured 1 standard bearing the arms of Virginia, over 50 prisoners, and about 500 horses, besides bringing away over 100 contrabands. A large camp of the enemy was also captured and destroyed near Charlottesville.&quot; Incredibly, Custer suffered only one casualty during the raid and skirmish at Rio Hill (one trooper slightly wounded).

Confederate Captain Moorman recorded his losses as such &quot;: Moorman&#x27;s battery, 2 men and 2 horses captured; Chew&#x27;s battery, 10 sets harness, 1 limber with canteens, 1 forge, 6 tents, 5 tent-flies, 4 tarpaulins, 60 pounds axle grease, 15 curry-combs and brushes, 3 public horses, 40 Government bags; Breathed&#x27;s battery, 9 tents, 2 horses, 3 1\2 sets harness; McGregor&#x27;s battery, 6 sets harness, 3 tent-flies, 12 bridles, 6 saddles and blankets, 4 halters, 2 mules, 4 skillets, 2 camp-kettles, 4 water-buckets. In addition to the losses enumerated I would state that the battalion suffered heavily in private effects, especially Chew&#x27;s and Breathed&#x27;s batteries.&quot; The partial destruction of the Confederate camp was quickly repaired.

Thus, the only casualties of the battle were one Federal slightly wounded and two Confederates captured.

==Legacy==

Though remembered with some sense of local pride as the only noteworthy Civil War engagement in Albemarle County, no effort was made to preserve the location of the camp and the surrounding battleground. Archaeological digs and research were conducted, but were limited, often carried out solely by curious locals with metal detectors. In 1988, a shopping center was built on the precise location of the Confederate camp; subsequent development covered virtually the entirety of the battlefield. In 1989, a Virginia Highway Marker, entitled &quot;Skirmish at Rio Hill&quot;, was placed in the shopping center to commemorate the event. A display case several yards away, erected by the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society, containing additional information about the battle was erected with support by the shopping center when it was built. The display was updated in February 2014 on the 150th anniversary of the event by the Historical Society.

On March 1, 2014, the 150-year anniversary of the skirmish, reenactors from the 7th Virginia Infantry, Company F, and the 19th Virginia Infantry, Company B, set up a living history display in the shopping center parking lot; the commemoration included the unveiling of an updated display case.

<doc id="377885" wikidata="Q335012" url="?curid=377885" title="The Tales of Hoffmann">
<text>The Tales of Hoffmann (French: ) is an by Jacques Offenbach. The French libretto was written by Jules Barbier, based on three short stories by E. T. A. Hoffmann, who is the protagonist of the story. It was Offenbach&#x27;s final work; he died in October 1880, four months before the premiere.

== Composition history and sources ==
Offenbach saw a play, , written by Barbier and Michel Carré and produced at the Odéon Theatre in Paris in 1851.

After returning from America in 1876, Offenbach learned that Barbier had adapted the play, which Hector Salomon had now set to music at the Opéra. Salomon handed the project to Offenbach. Work proceeded slowly, interrupted by the composition of profitable lighter works. Offenbach had a premonition, like Antonia, the heroine of Act 2, that he would die prior to its completion.

Offenbach continued working on the opera throughout 1880, attending some rehearsals. On 5 October 1880, he died with the manuscript in his hand, just four months before the opening. Shortly before he died, he wrote to Léon Carvalho: &quot;&quot;(&quot;Hurry up and stage my opera. I have not much time left, and my only wish is to attend the opening night.&quot;)

The stories in the opera include:

* &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Sandman&quot;), 1816.
* &quot;Rath Krespel&quot; (&quot;Councillor Krespel&quot;, also known in English as &quot;The Cremona Violin&quot;) 1818.
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Lost Reflection&quot;) from &quot;Die Abenteuer der Sylvester-Nacht&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;), 1814.

==Performance history==
The opera was first performed in a public venue at the Opéra-Comique on 10 February 1881, without the third (Venice) act. It was presented in an abridged form at Offenbach&#x27;s house, 8 Boulevard des Capucines, on 18 May 1879, with Madame Franck-Duvernoy in the soprano roles, Auguez as Hoffmann (baritone) and Émile-Alexandre Taskin in the four villain roles, with Edmond Duvernoy at the piano and a chorus directed by Albert Vizentini. Besides Léon Carvalho, director of the Opéra-Comique, the director of the Ringtheater in Vienna, Franz von Jauner, was also present. Both men requested the rights, but Offenbach granted them to Carvalho.

A four-act version with recitatives was staged at the Ringtheater on 7 December 1881, conducted by Joseph Hellmesberger Jr., although a gas explosion and fire occurred at the theatre after the second performance.

The opera reached its hundredth performance at the Salle Favart on 15 December 1881. The fire at the Opéra-Comique in 1887 destroyed the orchestral parts, and it was not seen again in Paris until 1893, at the Salle de la Renaissance du Théâtre-Lyrique, when it received 20 performances. A new production by Albert Carré (including the Venice act) was mounted at the Opéra-Comique in 1911, with Léon Beyle in the title role and Albert Wolff conducting. This production remained in the repertoire until World War II, receiving 700 performances. Following a recording by Opéra-Comique forces in March 1948, Louis Musy created the first post-war production in Paris, conducted by André Cluytens. The Paris Opera first staged the work in October 1974, directed by Patrice Chéreau with Nicolai Gedda in the title role.

Outside France, the piece was performed in Geneva, Budapest, Hamburg, New York, and Mexico in 1882, Vienna (Theater an der Wien), Prague, and Antwerp in 1883, and Lvov and Berlin in 1884. Local premieres included Buenos Aires in 1894, St Petersburg in 1899, Barcelona in 1905, and London in 1910.

==Synopsis==

===Prologue===

A tavern in Nuremberg: The Muse appears and reveals to the audience her purpose is to draw Hoffmann&#x27;s attention and make him abjure all his other loves, so he can be devoted only to her: &quot;poetry&quot;. She takes the appearance of Hoffmann&#x27;s closest friend, Nicklausse. The prima donna Stella, performing Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni,&quot; sends a letter to Hoffmann, requesting a meeting in her dressing room after the performance. The letter and the key to the room are intercepted by Councillor Lindorf (&quot; – In the languid lovers&#x27; roles), the first of the opera&#x27;s incarnations of evil, Hoffmann&#x27;s . Lindorf intends to replace Hoffmann at the rendezvous. In the tavern, students wait for Hoffmann. He finally arrives, and entertains them with the legend of Kleinzach, the dwarf (&quot;, “Once upon a time at the court of Eisenach”). Lindorf coaxes Hoffmann into telling the audience about his three great loves.

===Act 1 (Olympia)===

This act is based on a portion of &quot;Der Sandmann&quot;.

Parlor of a scientist in Paris: Hoffmann&#x27;s first love is Olympia, an automaton created by the scientist Spalanzani. Hoffmann has fallen in love with her, not realizing that she is a mechanical doll (&quot;, “Come on! Courage and trust... Ah! to live together!”). To warn Hoffmann, Nicklausse, possessing the truth about Olympia, sings a story of a mechanical doll with a human appearance, but Hoffmann ignores him (&quot;, “A doll with enamel eyes”). Coppélius, Olympia&#x27;s co-creator and the act&#x27;s incarnation of Nemesis, sells Hoffmann magic glasses to make Olympia appear as a real woman (&quot;, “I have eyes”).

Olympia sings one of the opera&#x27;s most famous arias, &quot; (”The birds in the bower”; often referred to as &quot;The Doll Song&quot;), during which she winds down and needs to be wound up by Spalanzani before she can continue singing. Hoffmann is tricked into believing his affections are returned, to the bemusement of Nicklausse, who subtly attempts to warn his friend (&quot;, “See her under her fan”). While dancing with Olympia, Hoffmann falls to the ground, breaking his magic glasses. At the same time, Coppélius bursts in, tearing Olympia apart in revenge against Spalanzani who had cheated him of his fees. With the crowd ridiculing him, Hoffmann realizes he had loved an automaton.

===Act 2 (Antonia)===

This act is based on &quot;.

Crespel&#x27;s house in Munich: After a long search, Hoffmann finds the house where Crespel and his daughter Antonia are hiding. Hoffmann and Antonia loved each other, but were separated after Crespel decided to hide his daughter from Hoffmann. Antonia inherited her mother&#x27;s talent for singing, but her father forbids her to sing because of her mysterious illness. Antonia wishes her lover would return to her (&quot;&quot;, &quot;She fled, the dove&quot;). Her father also forbids her to see Hoffmann, who encourages Antonia in her musical career, and therefore endangers her without knowing it. Crespel tells Frantz, his servant, to stay with his daughter, and after Crespel leaves, Frantz sings a comical song about his talents (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Day and night, I quarter my mind”).

After Crespel leaves his house, Hoffmann takes advantage of the occasion to sneak in, and the lovers are reunited (a love duet: &quot;&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a love song&quot;). After Crespel returns, he receives a visit from Dr. Miracle, the act&#x27;s Nemesis, forcing Crespel to let him heal her. Eavesdropping, Hoffmann learns Antonia may die if she sings too much. He returns to her boudoir and makes her promise to give up her artistic dreams. Antonia reluctantly accepts her lover&#x27;s will. After she is alone, Dr. Miracle enters Antonia&#x27;s boudoir to persuade her to sing and follow her mother&#x27;s path to glory, stating Hoffmann is sacrificing her to his brutishness, and loves her only for her beauty. With mystic powers, he raises a vision of Antonia&#x27;s dead mother and induces Antonia to sing, causing her death. Crespel arrives just in time to witness his daughter&#x27;s last breath. Hoffmann enters, and Crespel wants to kill him, thinking he is responsible for his daughter&#x27;s death. Nicklausse saves his friend from the old man&#x27;s vengeance.

===Act 3 (Giulietta)===
This act is loosely based on &quot;&quot; (&quot;A New Year&#x27;s Eve Adventure&quot;).

A gallery in a Venetian palace: The act opens with the barcarolle &quot;&quot; (&quot;Beautiful night, oh night of love&quot;). Hoffmann falls in love with the courtesan Giulietta and thinks she returns his affections (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Friends, tender and dreamy love&quot;). Giulietta is not in love with Hoffmann, but seducing him under the orders of Captain Dapertutto, who promises her a diamond if she steals Hoffmann&#x27;s reflection from a mirror (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Sparkle, diamond&quot;). The jealous Schlemil (see Peter Schlemihl for a literary antecedent), a previous victim of Giulietta and Dapertutto (he gave Giulietta his shadow), challenges the poet to a duel but is killed thanks to the magic sword Hoffmann was given by Dapertutto. Nicklausse wants to take Hoffmann away from Venice and looks for horses. Meanwhile, Hoffmann meets Giulietta and cannot resist her (&quot;&quot;, &quot;O God! of what intoxication&quot;): he gives her his reflection, only to be abandoned by the courtesan, to Dapertutto&#x27;s great pleasure.

In the original version, Hoffmann, furious at being betrayed, tries to stab Giulietta but — blinded by Dapertutto — mistakenly kills his dwarf, Pittichinaccio. In Richard Bonynge&#x27;s version, Giulietta is poisoned and dies by accidentally drinking the philter Dapertutto prepared for Nicklausse.

===Epilogue===
The tavern in Nuremberg: Hoffmann, drunk, swears he will never love again, and explains that Olympia, Antonia, and Giulietta are three facets of the same person, Stella. They represent the young girl&#x27;s, the musician&#x27;s, and the courtesan&#x27;s side of the &quot;prima donna&quot;, respectively. After Hoffmann says he does not want to love any more, Nicklausse reveals she is the Muse and reclaims Hoffmann: &quot;Be reborn a poet! I love you, Hoffmann! Be mine&quot; (&quot;&quot;). The magical poetry reaches Hoffmann and he sings &quot; (&quot;O God! of what intoxication&quot;) once more, ending with &quot;Muse, whom I love, I am yours&quot; (&quot;&quot;). At this moment, Stella, tired of waiting for Hoffmann to come to her rendezvous, enters the tavern and finds him drunk. The poet tells her to leave (&quot;Farewell, I will not follow you, phantom, the spectre of the past&quot;, &quot;&quot;), and Lindorf, waiting in the shadows, comes forth. Nicklausse explains to Stella that Hoffmann does not love her anymore, but Councillor Lindorf is waiting for her. Some students enter the room for more drinking while Stella and Lindorf leave together.

The aria &quot; (Song of little Zaches) in the prologue is based on the short story &quot; (&quot;Little Zaches, called cinnabar&quot;), 1819. The barcarolle, &quot;Belle nuit, ô nuit d&#x27;amour&quot; in the Venetian act, is the opera&#x27;s famous number, borrowed by Offenbach from his earlier opera &quot;Rheinnixen&quot; (French: &quot;Les fées du Rhin&quot;).

==Editions==

Offenbach died four months before the premiere, having completed the piano score and some orchestration. As a result of this and the practical demands of the Opéra-Comique director, different editions of the opera emerged, some bearing little resemblance to his conception, with cuts or the addition of music he did not sketch or compose. The version performed at the opera&#x27;s premiere was by Ernest Guiraud, after completing Offenbach&#x27;s scoring, but without the Giulietta act, some of its music being moved to the Antonia act and epilogue. Choudens published at least four divergent scores of the opera in 1881 and 1882. At the Opéra-Comique in Paris dialogue between musical numbers would be spoken; for productions outside France he would have composed recitatives to replace it.

The work was the object of considerable further rewriting for a 1904 production in Monte Carlo by the theatre director Raoul Gunsbourg and André Bloch with new words by Barbier&#x27;s son Pierre. The air &quot;&quot;, based on a theme from the overture to Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;A Journey to the Moon&quot; was added for Dapertutto, and a sextet (sometimes called septet, counting the chorus) containing elements of the barcarolle, to make a climax to the final scene. Much of this was reproduced in 1907 by Choudens in performance materials, which also gave Dapertutto&#x27;s original air to Coppélius and added a passage where Hoffmann realizes that he has lost his reflection. This edition held sway for many years around the world, while the practice arose of assigning the soprano roles to different singers, a basic denial of the dramatic unity of the work. Offenbach intended the four soprano roles be taken by the same singer, for Olympia, Giulietta, and Antonia are three facets of Stella, Hoffmann&#x27;s unreachable love. Similarly, the four villains (Lindorf, Coppélius, Miracle, and Dapertutto) would be the same bass-baritone, as they all represents the evil forces against which he is pitted.
There were a few attempts to return to Offenbach&#x27;s original intentions, including a “pioneering version” by the conductor Arthur Hammond for the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1952. Richard Bonynge tried to revert to Offenbach&#x27;s conception for his 1971 complete recording, despite the major lack of source material at that time.

Since the 1970s new performing editions appeared, particularly after the discovery of manuscript sources by conductor Antonio de Almeida, used in editions by Fritz Oeser in 1976 and Michael Kaye in 1988. While compiling a thematic catalogue of Offenbach&#x27;s works, de Almeida went to the house in Saint-Mandé of the heir of one of the composer&#x27;s daughters, containing Offenbach&#x27;s piano, and discovered a folder containing the manuscript parts (in the hand of Offenbach&#x27;s copyists, but with autograph annotations), including those used in May 1879. The 1,250 manuscript-page find comprised parts of autograph vocal score, fragments of libretto and the Venice act orchestrated by Guiraud. de Almeida considered the main improvement was “the emergence of Nicklausse/Muse as the most important character after the title-role” giving meaning to the overall narrative and the Muse–Hoffmann relationship. “When the Muse at the end sings to Hoffmann that it is to her he has to turn, the main thread of the work is made clear”. This version also allowed Act 1 (Olympia) to flow directly from the Prologue (so the minuet is reserved for the entrance of the guests later); there is also a seamless transition from Act 3 (Giulietta) into the Epilogue. French Offenbach scholar Jean-Christophe Keck comments that Oeser in fact reorchestrated around three-quarters of the score, introducing new instruments, adding more from &quot;Die Rheinnixen&quot; and added back cuts made by the composer. The Oeser version was given in full for the first time in Reims in 1983 and recorded by EMI in 1988.

In 1984 a London auction sold manuscripts of 300 pages found at the Château de Cormatin, which had belonged to Gunsbourg, consisting of virtually all the cuts from the initial rehearsal period. American researcher Michael Kaye learnt about these and set about making his own edition of 1992 (first performed on stage at the Los Angeles Opera in 1988), but, then, additional authentic music was found, and published in 1999. In 2011 a critical joint edition (&#x27;Kaye-Keck&#x27;) was released reflecting and reconciling the research of recent decades and productions drawing on this edition (including prior to its publication) have been premiered from 1988 (US), followed by France (1993), Germany (1995), UK (1998), China (2005) and Russia (2011).

A version including the authentic music by Offenbach was reconstructed by the Offenbach scholar Jean-Christophe Keck. A performance of this version was produced at the Lausanne Opera (Switzerland). In early 2016, Jean-Christophe Keck announced that he had traced and identified the full manuscript of the Prologue and the Olympia act, with vocal lines by Offenbach and instrumentation by Guiraud. The Antonia act and epilogue are in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, while the Giulietta act is in Offenbach family archives.

Writing in 1997, Andrew Lamb observed that “the original order of acts, a single soprano heroine and single baritone villain, identification of Nicklause with the Muse” as well as removal of accretions by Barbier and Bloch “give a faithful representation of Offenbach&#x27;s conception&quot;.

==Recordings==

<text>Sandra Birgitte Toksvig (; ; born 3 May 1958) is a Danish-British broadcaster, comedian, presenter and writer on British radio, stage and television. She is also a political activist, having co-founded the Women&#x27;s Equality Party in 2015. She has written plays, novels and books for children. In 1994, she came out as a lesbian.

Toksvig took over from Stephen Fry as host of the BBC television quiz show &quot;QI&quot; in 2016 (series &#x27;N&#x27;), having been a guest a number of times and spent ten years hosting &quot;The News Quiz&quot; on BBC Radio 4. From 2017 to 2020, she was co-presenter of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;, alongside comedian Noel Fielding. In 2020, she stepped down and was replaced by Matt Lucas.

Toksvig was the president of the Women of the Year Lunch from 2015 to 2017.

==Early life==
Toksvig was born in 1958 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Her father, Claus Toksvig, was a Danish journalist, broadcaster and foreign correspondent; as a result, Toksvig spent most of her youth outside Denmark, mostly in New York City. Her mother, Julie Anne Toksvig (&quot;née&quot; Brett), is British. She has an older brother, Nick, who is a journalist, and a younger sister, Jenifer, a librettist, who was born when Sandi was 12. When Sandi was 24, she was appointed Jenifer&#x27;s legal guardian. In 1969, her father covered the landing of the first man on the moon from mission control; she was holding the hand of Neil Armstrong&#x27;s secretary during the landing. While her father was based in London, she attended Tormead School, an independent girls&#x27; school near Guildford. Her first job, at the age of 18, was as a follow spot operator for the musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

She read law, archaeology and anthropology at Girton College, Cambridge, graduating with a first-class degree and receiving two prizes (The Raemakers and the Theresa Montefiore Awards) for outstanding achievement. One of her law supervisors was Lord Denning.

==Career==


===Beginnings===
Toksvig began her comedy career at Girton, where she wrote and performed in the first all-woman show at the Footlights. She was there at the same time as Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Tony Slattery and Emma Thompson, and wrote additional material for the Perrier award-winning Cambridge Footlights Revue. She was also a member of the Cambridge University Light Entertainment Society.

She started her television career on children&#x27;s television, presenting &quot;No. 73&quot; (1982–1986), the &quot;Sandwich Quiz&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Starship&quot;, &quot;Motormouth&quot;, &quot;Gilbert&#x27;s Fridge&quot;, for Television South, and factual programmes such as &quot;Island Race&quot; and &quot;The Talking Show&quot;, produced by Open Media for Channel 4. In 2000, she appeared as a guest presenter on &quot;Time Team&quot;, at a dig in York (season 7 episode 13).

===Comedy===
In the comedy circuit, Toksvig performed at the first night of the Comedy Store in London, and was once part of their Players, an improvisational comedy team.

In television, she appeared as a panellist in comedy shows such as &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; (a regular as a team captain), &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, &quot;Mock the Week&quot;, &quot;QI&quot; and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, where she appeared on the first episode in 1990. She was also the host of &quot;What the Dickens&quot;, a Sky Arts quiz show.

On radio, she is a familiar voice for BBC Radio 4 listeners, having appeared on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot;, and as the chair of &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, where she replaced Simon Hoggart in September 2006, but left in June 2015 in order to enter politics to champion women&#x27;s rights. Her final show was first broadcast on 26 June 2015. She presented Radio 4&#x27;s travel programme &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; until it was axed in 2012.

===Drama and factual===
In 1993, Toksvig wrote a musical, &quot;Big Night Out at the Little Sands Picture Palace&quot;, for Nottingham Playhouse, co-starring with Anita Dobson and Una Stubbs. In 2002, it was re-written, with Dilly Keane, for the Watford Palace Theatre, in which they appeared with Bonnie Langford. Toksvig and Elly Brewer wrote a Shakespeare deconstruction, &quot;The Pocket Dream&quot;, which Toksvig performed at the Nottingham Playhouse and which transferred to the West End for a short run. The pair also wrote the 1992 TV series &quot;The Big One&quot;, in which she also starred. She has appeared in a number of stage plays, including &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;.

In 1996, she narrated the &quot;Dragons!&quot; interactive CD-ROM published by Oxford University Press and developed by Inner Workings, along with Harry Enfield. The software was primarily aimed at children and featured songs and poems about dragons. She also narrated the &quot;Winnie the Witch&quot; CD-ROM. She appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;Red&quot; by Big Finish Productions, released in August 2006. In December 2006, she hosted and sang at the London Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus sold-out Christmas show, &quot;Make the Yuletide Gay&quot;, at the Barbican Centre. Over Christmas and New Year 2007/2008, she narrated the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Old Vic Theatre. In October 2011, she narrated the new musical &quot;Soho Cinders&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, London. In 2011, she hosted a second season of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Master&quot;.

Toksvig wrote a play entitled &quot;Bully Boy&quot; which focused on post-traumatic stress among British servicemen. The play premièred at the Nuffield Theatre in Southampton in May 2011, and starred Anthony Andrews. The play then launched the debut season of St James Theatre in September 2012, the first new West End theatre to open in 30 years.

In the 2013 Christmas Special of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;, Toksvig made a cameo appearance as grumpy ward nurse Sister Gibbs.

On 28 April 2015, it was announced that Toksvig would leave BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The News Quiz&quot; in June at the end of the 28th series, which was scheduled to begin on 15 May of that year. She said: &quot;I have decided it is time to move on and, of course, I feel sad but I think it&#x27;s the right moment. The show is in great shape and, like a good house guest, you should always depart when people still wish you&#x27;d stay a bit longer.&quot; The BBC said Toksvig had made the &quot;difficult decision&quot; to leave in order &quot;to embark on a new and exciting stage of her career&quot;. On 30 April 2015, Toksvig announced that her decision to quit &quot;The News Quiz&quot; had been made in order to allow her to help set up a new political party named the Women&#x27;s Equality Party.

In November 2015, Toksvig was a guest of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Her choices included Joe Nichols (&quot;What&#x27;s a Guy Gotta Do&quot;), Gustav Winckler, The Weather Girls, Barbra Streisand and Bonnie Langford. Her book choice was &quot;The Ashley Book of Knots&quot;, and her luxury item was an endless supply of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for use as clothing, insulation and toilet paper.

Her most recent play &quot;Silver Lining&quot; opened at the Rose Theatre Kingston on 11 February 2017, before touring to Portsmouth, Oxford, Cambridge, Ipswich, Keswick, York and Salford. It centres around five elderly ladies and a young carer in a retirement home which is about to be flooded by a storm. It stars Rachel Davies, Keziah Joseph, Maggie McCarthy, Joanna Monro, Sheila Reid and Amanda Walker. Toksvig&#x27;s son, Theo Toksvig-Stewart, made his professional stage debut in the play.

On 11 June 2019, Toksvig appeared on former Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard&#x27;s podcast. Notably, Toksvig stated &quot;Wikipedia is a marvellous idea and the idea is that it is a crowd-sourced encyclopaedia of knowledge, what a fantastic notion. But what&#x27;s happening is that women are disappearing, so 90% of Wikipedia&#x27;s content is about &quot;men&quot; and their achievements, and 9% is about &quot;women&quot;. One per cent are still making up their mind. So that proportion is completely out of kilter and we desperately need to do something about it. Part of the problem is that it is edited by volunteers but there are about 350,000 &quot;uber&quot; volunteers that tend, no offence to them, to be the same kind of guy who has the time to sit and do it and doesn&#x27;t have laundry to do and are actively editing women out. There are two issues: 1) women&#x27;s achievements are not being inputted and 2) women are actively being edited out... I am intent on trying to change this if we can.&quot;

During the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020, Toksvig created and performed &quot;Vox Tox&quot;, a YouTube mini-series, from her home. These 10-minute sessions promoted the activities of women across the ages, being inspired by items from Toksvig&#x27;s own library of books and biographies.

Toksvig collaborated with Björn Ulvaeus on &quot;Mamma Mia:The Party&quot; in 2018, leading to her officiating at his wedding to Christina Sas in Copenhagen on 21st September 2024.

===Writing===
Toksvig has written more than twenty fiction and non-fiction books for children and adults, starting in 1994 with &quot;Tales from the Norse&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, a fiction tale for children. In 1995, she sailed around the coast of Britain with John McCarthy, who had been held hostage in Beirut. In 2003, she published &quot;Gladys Reunited: A Personal American Journey&quot;, about her travels in the USA retracing her childhood. She writes regular columns for &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Lady&quot;. In October 2008, she published &quot;Girls Are Best&quot;, a history book for girls.

In 2009, her collected columns for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; were published in book form as &quot;The Chain of Curiosity&quot;. In 2012, she published her book, &quot;Valentine Grey&quot;, an historical novel set in the Boer War. Her 2006 young adult book, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Canary&quot; is a Holocaust story told by a boy named Bamse and his family. The characters are based on Toksvig&#x27;s own father and grandmother; the family heroism in the story closely resembles the author&#x27;s father&#x27;s own experiences during the war. Her memoir &quot;Between the Stops: The View of My Life from the Top of the Number 12 Bus&quot; was published on 29 October 2019.

In 2020, Toksvig wrote and presented a podcast series called &quot;We Will Get Past This&quot; which aimed to provide &quot;virtual chicken soup for the soul&quot; during the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK, by sharing stories of notable women from her book collection.

===Television presenter===
In 2012–13 Toksvig presented &quot;1001 Things You Should Know&quot; for Channel 4 daytime. Toksvig began presenting the revival edition of the daytime game show &quot;Fifteen-to-One&quot; in April 2014. It is an hour-long instead of the original half-hour edition presented by William G. Stewart. After two series had been broadcast, in June 2015, Channel 4 announced that a further eight series would be made, hosted by Toksvig until the revived series ended on 28 June 2019.

Toksvig took over from Stephen Fry as host of &quot;QI&quot;, making her &quot;the first female presenter of a British mainstream TV comedy panel show&quot;, a fact she found extraordinary in 2016. Her first appearance as host (or Bantermeister) was the first episode of the show&#x27;s series &quot;N&quot;, which was broadcast on 21 October 2016.

On 16 March 2017, she was announced as the new co-presenter of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; on Channel 4, alongside Noel Fielding. They replaced the previous hosts, Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc. In January 2020, she announced she was leaving the show to focus on other work commitments, and was replaced by Matt Lucas.

Toksvig presented Channel 4&#x27;s four-part travel series &quot;Extraordinary Escapes with Sandi Toksvig&quot;, which premiered on 10 February 2021. In December 2021, Channel 4 renewed the series for a second series, which premiered on 17 February 2022. Series three premiered on 7 June 2023.

In January 2025, Toksvig presented &quot;Sandi&#x27;s Great British Woodland Restoration&quot;; a Channel 4 three-part documentary series.

==Politics and activism==
Toksvig first came to wider public prominence in 1994 because the charity Save the Children dropped her services as compère of its 75th anniversary celebrations after she came out as gay. The decision led to a direct action protest by the Lesbian Avengers, and the charity apologised.

Toksvig supports the charity and pressure group Liberty, hosting its 2012 awards ceremony. She was appointed president of the Women of the Year Lunch. An atheist and humanist, Toksvig is a patron of Humanists UK.

In October 2012, as the scale of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal became apparent, and amid claims that during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, there was a culture within the BBC which tolerated sexual harassment, Toksvig stated that she was groped by a &quot;famous individual&quot; on air in the 1980s. Toksvig said the allegations of inappropriate behaviour at the BBC &quot;did not surprise me at all&quot;. In September 2018, as the BBC gender-pay-gap controversy continued to unfold, Toksvig reported that she was only paid 40% of what Fry, her predecessor, had received. Toksvig had earlier told the &quot;Radio Times&quot; it would be &quot;absurd&quot; if she did not receive the same salary as him for chairing &quot;QI.&quot;

In 2003, she stood as a candidate in the election for the Chancellorship of the University of Oxford, supporting a campaign against student fees. She was defeated in the first round of voting, achieving 1,179 first-place votes out of about 8,000 cast. The election was won by Chris Patten. Almost a decade later she succeeded Sheila Hancock as Chancellor of the University of Portsmouth.

Toksvig&#x27;s party-political sympathies have developed over the years. She was part of Red Wedge&#x27;s comedy tour in the 1980s, which supported the Labour Party. By the 2004 elections, she was a high-profile celebrity supporter of the Liberal Democrats. She has received some criticism for joking about the Tories in 2011 (they&#x27;ve &quot;put the &#x27;N&#x27; into cuts&quot; to child benefit), but had said Prime Minister Theresa May is &quot;a good person&quot;. She has also joked about UKIP leader Nigel Farage. In 2012, she said in an interview that &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a party that represents anything I believe in&quot;.

In 2023, Toksvig stated the reluctance of the Church of England to accept same sex marriage was harming gay people. Toksvig stated &quot;The problem is there is only one side that is impinging on the lives of others. And I&#x27;m afraid the very conservative people who interpret the Bible with less love than I would hope are causing severe mental health problems for the LGBTQ+ community. My wife works in mental health with the queer community and the figures are shocking for a young LGBT person committing suicide, or attempting suicide, not because they feel bad about who they are, but because of the way society stigmatises them. So it&#x27;s not an equal battle that we&#x27;re having here.&quot; Toksvig is campaigning to end 26 Church of England bishops sitting in the House of Lords. Later that year, she spoke with Louis Staples for the &quot;i&quot; newspaper about this, saying &quot;They don&#x27;t deal with gay people or women in an equitable manner. And they aren&#x27;t some sort of obscure organisation—this is our &quot;state church&quot;. ... This is our parliament and it&#x27;s not OK. Be a bigot if you want to, in your own back yard—but don&#x27;t come and play in mine.&quot; She also spoke of her &quot;distress&quot; at &quot;people who call themselves &#x27;radical feminists&#x27; but are anti-trans&quot;, saying that &quot;When the feminist movement started in the 60s and 70s, lesbians were often excluded, because we were told that we would make the movement less palatable. I have been excluded myself, so how could I do that to someone else? It fills me with rage.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s Equality Party===
In April 2015, Toksvig chaired the first, informal, conference of a new political party, the Women&#x27;s Equality Party, and then left her job as presenter of &quot;The News Quiz&quot; to formally co-found it. She later explained that she had decided that it was &quot;not too late to fight the good fight, after all&quot;. In September the same year, she announced the dates for a comedy tour to raise funds for the party. The party&#x27;s full set of policies was launched at Conway Hall, 20 October 2015.

==Personal life==
Toksvig is the mother of two daughters and a son, born in 1988, 1990 and 1994. The children were carried by her partner, Peta Stewart, and were conceived through artificial insemination by donor Christopher Lloyd-Pack, younger brother of the actor Roger Lloyd-Pack.

It was having three young children that made her decide to come out, because, to the best of her knowledge, there were no out lesbians in British public life, and she did not want her children to grow up ashamed of having two mothers. Toksvig was warned she might never work again, and the family faced death threats and had to go into hiding.

Toksvig and Stewart separated in 1997. Toksvig now lives on a houseboat in Wandsworth with psychotherapist Debbie Toksvig, whom she joined in a civil partnership in 2007. They renewed their vows on 29 March 2014, the day same-sex marriage was introduced in England and Wales, and in December 2014, their civil partnership was converted into a marriage.

Toksvig became a British citizen in 2013. She describes her &quot;posh&quot; accent as being the result of a deliberate attempt to copy the voice of Celia Johnson in &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, after being ostracised at boarding school for having an American accent.

In her late fifties, she lost a significant amount of weight on medical advice and credits this with giving her the confidence to go back to television.

In late 2022, Toksvig was hospitalised in Australia with bronchial pneumonia, and was forced to cancel her upcoming New Zealand tour dates. On 6 December 2022, she announced that she had left hospital, but was still not well enough to travel. On 15 December, it was reported that she had returned to the UK.

<text> () is an opera by Giacomo Meyerbeer and is one of the most popular and spectacular examples of grand opera. In five acts, to a libretto by Eugène Scribe and Émile Deschamps, it premiered in Paris on 29 February 1836.

==Composition history==
&quot;Les Huguenots&quot; was some five years in creation. Meyerbeer prepared carefully for this opera after the sensational success of &quot;Robert le diable&quot;, recognising the need to continue to present lavish staging, a highly dramatic storyline, impressive orchestration and virtuoso parts for the soloists – the essential elements of the new genre of Grand Opera. Meyerbeer and his librettist for &quot;Robert le Diable&quot;, Eugène Scribe, had agreed to collaborate on an epic work concerning the French Wars of Religion, with a drama partly based on Prosper Mérimée&#x27;s 1829 novel &quot;A Chronicle of the Reign of Charles IX&quot;.
Coming from a wealthy family, Meyerbeer could afford to take his time, dictate his own terms, and to be a perfectionist. The very detailed contract which Meyerbeer arranged with Louis-Désiré Véron, director of the Opéra, for &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; (and which was drawn up for him by the lawyer Adolphe Crémieux) is a testament to this. While Meyerbeer was writing the opera, another opera with a similar setting and theme (&quot;Le pré aux clercs&quot; by Ferdinand Hérold) was also produced in Paris (1832). Like Meyerbeer&#x27;s, Hérold&#x27;s work was extremely popular in its time, although it is now only seldom performed.

Meyerbeer decided that he wanted more historical details of the period and a greater psychological depth to the characters than Scribe&#x27;s text was supplying so he obtained Scribe&#x27;s approval to invite a second librettist, Émile Deschamps, to collaborate on the text in order to furnish these elements. Meyerbeer was recommended to take his wife to a warmer climate for her health, and while in Italy for that purpose he consulted with the librettist of his earlier Italian operas, Gaetano Rossi. With his advice Meyerbeer himself re-wrote the part of Marcel, one of the most striking and original characters in the piece. Meyerbeer also accepted the advice of star tenor 
Adolphe Nourrit, chosen to create the part of Raoul, to expand the love duet in Act 4, which became one of the most famous numbers in the opera.

==Performance history==

&quot;Les Huguenots&quot; was premiered by the Paris Opera at the Salle Le Peletier on 29 February 1836 (conductor: François Habeneck), and was an immediate success. Both Adolphe Nourrit and Cornélie Falcon were particularly praised by the critics for their singing and performances. It was indeed Falcon&#x27;s last important creation before her voice so tragically failed in April of the following year. Hector Berlioz called the score &quot;a musical encyclopedia&quot;. &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; was the first opera to be performed at the Opéra more than 1,000 times (the 1,000th performance being on 16 May 1906) and continued to be produced regularly up to 1936, more than a century after its premiere.(The Paris Opera opened a new production of &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; in September 2018, the first time since 1936 for the opera to be performed there). Its many performances in all other of the world&#x27;s major opera houses give it a claim to being the most successful opera of the 19th century.

Other first performances included London (Covent Garden Theatre), 20 June 1842, and New Orleans (Théâtre d&#x27;Orléans) on 29 April 1839. Due to its subject matter it was sometimes staged under different titles such as &quot;The Guelfs and the Ghibellines&quot; (in Vienna before 1848), &quot;Renato di Croenwald&quot; in Rome, or &quot;The Anglicans and the Puritans&quot; (in Munich), to avoid inflaming religious tensions among its audiences.

&quot;Les Huguenots&quot; was chosen to open the present building of the Covent Garden Theatre in 1858. During the 1890s, when it was performed at the Metropolitan Opera, it was often called &#x27;the night of the seven stars&#x27;, as the cast would include Lillian Nordica, Nellie Melba, Sofia Scalchi, Jean de Reszke, Édouard de Reszke, Victor Maurel and Pol Plançon. The opera was performed in Italian at the Met in the 19th century as &quot;Gli Ugonotti&quot;.

===Soviet adaptation===
In the Soviet Union, the opera was given a new libretto as &quot;Dekabristy&quot;, about the historical Decembrists.

===Modern revivals===
As with Meyerbeer&#x27;s other operas, &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; lost favor in the early part of the twentieth century and it fell out of the operatic repertoire worldwide, except for very occasional revivals. Dame Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge were the major force in the opera&#x27;s revival during the second half of the 20th century. Sutherland chose the opera for her final performance at the Sydney Opera House on 2 October 1990, Bonynge conducting the Opera Australia Orchestra.

Amongst reasons often adduced for the dearth of productions in the 20th century were the scale of the work and the cost of mounting it, as well as the alleged lack of virtuoso singers capable of doing justice to Meyerbeer&#x27;s demanding music. However, recent successful productions of the opera at relatively small centres such as Metz (2004) show that this conventional wisdom can be challenged. Since then, there have been highly successful new productions of &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; at major opera houses in France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. Performances of &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; are no longer rare in Europe.

==Synopsis==
The story culminates in the historical St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre in 1572 in which thousands of French Huguenots (Protestants) were slaughtered by Catholics in an effort to rid France of Protestant influence. Although the massacre was a historical event, the rest of the action, which primarily concerns the love between the Catholic Valentine and the Protestant Raoul, is wholly a creation of Scribe.

A short orchestral prelude, featuring Martin Luther&#x27;s chorale &quot;Ein feste Burg&quot;, replaces the extended overture Meyerbeer originally intended for the opera.

===Act 1===
&quot;The stage represents the chateau of the Count of Nevers, in Touraine. In the background, large open windows show gardens and a lawn, on which several lords play ball; on the right, a door leading into the inner apartments; at left, a window closed by a curtain and which is supposed to lead to a prayer room; at the front of the stage, other lords are playing dice, cup and ball,etc. Nevers, Tavannes, Cossé, Retz, Thoré, Méru and other Catholic lords look at them and talk to each other&quot;

The Catholic Count of Nevers is entertaining his fellow noblemen. Their host informs them that before they can go to dinner, they must await the arrival of Raoul, a young Huguenot sent to them from the King in an effort to reconcile Protestant and Catholic. Raoul enters, very impressed with the surroundings and to be in the company of the noblemen. Lavish dishes of food and copious supplies of wine are brought in and the nobles encourage Raoul to drink (&quot; L’orgie: &quot;Bonheur de la table&quot;)&quot;. The Count of Nevers announces that he has just become engaged and that he must now give up his mistresses. However, he invites his guests to describe the ones they are in love with and asks the latest arrival, Raoul de Nangis. Raoul then tells how he rescued a girl from an attack on her in the street. Although he does not know her name or her origins, he immediately fell in love (&quot;Romance: &quot;Plus blanche que la blanche hermine&quot;)&quot;. (With a daring and unusual stroke of orchestration, Meyerbeer accompanies this aria with a solo viola d&#x27;amore). Raoul&#x27;s Protestant servant Marcel enters and the old man is shocked to see his master in such wicked company enjoying games, drinking and tales of love. Marcel sings a hearty Protestant prayer (to the tune of &#x27;Ein feste Burg&#x27;) while the Catholic lords toast their mistresses. One of the Catholics recognises the old man from a battle they fought and asks him to have a drink with him to bury any grudge. Marcel refuses, and then, at the Catholics&#x27; request,he sings a Huguenot battle song from the siege of La Rochelle, calling for the extermination of Catholics &quot;(Chanson huguenote: &quot;Piff, paff, piff, paff&quot;).&quot; The Catholics are merely amused by this.

A valet of the Count of Nevers informs his master that a mysterious woman wishes to speak to him. The count goes out to meet the stranger. Catholic lords wonder about the identity of the unknown woman and try to see her. They invite Raoul to do the same. Recognizing the young woman he saved and fell in love with, the young Huguenot, believing she is one of the mistresses of the Count of Nevers he has been boasting about, swears never to see her again. In fact she is Nevers&#x27; intended bride, Valentine (daughter of St. Bris), instructed by the Queen to break off her engagement. The page Urbain enters with a secret message for Raoul, daring him to come blindfolded to a secret rendezvous with an unnamed woman &quot;( Cavatina: &quot;Une dame noble et sage&quot;)&quot;. The Catholics recognize the seal on the letter as belonging to the Queen of Navarre and drink to Raoul&#x27;s health as he is led away.

===Act 2===
&quot;The castle and gardens at the Château de Chenonceaux. The river meanders to the middle of the stage, disappearing from time to time behind clumps of green trees. On the right, a wide staircase by which we descend from the castle into the gardens.&quot;

Queen Marguerite looks into a mirror held by her enamoured page Urbain, and sings a virtuoso pastorale (&quot;O beau pays de la Touraine)&quot;. She hopes to avoid the religious strife plaguing France by remaining in the beautiful countryside &quot;(Cabaletta: A ce mot seul s’anime et renaît la nature&quot;).Valentine enters and reports that Nevers has agreed to break the engagement, which delights Marguerite as, knowing that Valentine has fallen in love with Raoul de Nangis, she is sure that she will be able to persuade Valentine&#x27;s father, the Catholic Saint-Bris, to allow his daughter to marry the young Protestant as a step towards ending sectarian strife. Marguerite&#x27;s entourage of ladies enter dressed for bathing. This leads to a ballet during which the page Urbain attempts to spy on the scantily clad ladies as they frolic in the water. Urbain laughingly describes the journey of Raoul, blindfolded, to the castle &quot;(Rondeau: &quot;Non, non, non, vous n’avez jamais, je gage&quot;)&quot; He enters and the Queen tells her ladies to leave him alone with her. With his sight restored, Raoul is amazed by the beauty of his surroundings as well as that of the young woman who stands before him, while she is tempted to try to keep the charming young man for herself rather than have him marry Valentine as she had planned &quot;(Duet: &quot;Beauté divine enchanteresse&quot;)&quot;.The lords and ladies of the court, including Nevers and Saint-Bris enter, and the Queen orders everyone to swear friendship and peace, which all aver, except for Marcel, who disapproves of his master mixing with Catholics &quot;(Oath:Par l’honneur, par le nom que portaient)&quot;. The Queen presents Valentine to Raoul as the girl he loves and will marry to cement relations between the Protestant and Catholic factions. In a complex final ensemble, Raoul, who believes Valentine is the mistress of Nevers, refuses to comply with the Queen&#x27;s command. The nobles then swear revenge, Valentine is devastated by this insult to her honour, the Queen does not understand Raoul&#x27;s reason for rejecting the marriage and Marcel reproaches Raoul for consorting with Catholics.

===Act 3===

&quot;Paris, the &#x27;Pré aux clercs&#x27; on the left bank of the Seine, at sunset. On the left, a tavern where Catholic students sit with girls; on the right, another tavern in front of which Huguenot soldiers drink and play dice. In the background, on the left, the entrance to a chapel. In the middle, a huge tree shading the meadow. At the front of the stage, clerics from La Basoche and grisettes sit on chairs and chat between themselves. Others are walking around. Workers, merchants,traveling musicians, monks, and middle-class townspeople. It is six o&#x27;clock in the evening, in the month of August.&quot;

Citizens enjoy a stroll on a beautiful Sunday evening &quot;(Entracte et chœur: C’est le jour de dimanche)&quot;. The Huguenot soldiers sing a blood-thirsty war song in praise of the Protestant Admiral Coligny &quot;(Couplets militaires: &quot;Prenant son sabre de bataille&quot;)&quot;. A procession of Catholic girls crosses the scene on the way to the chapel where Valentine and Nevers are about to be married, chanting praise to the Virgin &quot;(Litanies :&quot; Vierge Marie, soyez bénie !&quot;)&quot; Marcel enters with a letter from Raoul to Saint-Bris and interrupts the procession, seeking to know Saint-Bris&#x27;s whereabouts. The Catholics are outraged by Marcel&#x27;s sacrilege but the Huguenot soldiers defend him. Tension is rising when a band of gypsies enter, dancing and telling fortunes, and calm things down &quot;(Ronde bohémienne: &quot;Venez ! – Vous qui voulez savoir d’avance&quot; and gypsy dance)&quot;. Valentine has just married Nevers, but remains in the chapel to pray. Marcel delivers a challenge from Raoul. Saint-Bris decides to kill Raoul, but is overheard by Valentine. The town crier declares curfew (the scene anticipating a similar one in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;) and the crowds disperse. Valentine, in disguise, tells Marcel of the plot by her father and others to murder Raoul (Duet:&quot;Dans la nuit où seul je veille&quot;). Valentine realises that despite the public humiliation inflicted on her by Raoul she still loves him and returns to the chapel. Raoul, Saint-Bris and their witnesses arrive for the duel, each confident of success &quot;(Septet: &quot;En mon bon droit j’ai confiance&quot;)&quot;. Marcel calls for assistance from the Huguenot soldiers in the tavern on the right and Saint-Bris to the Catholic students in the tavern on the left and a near-riot ensues. Only the arrival of the Queen, on horseback, stems the chaos. Raoul realises that Valentine has saved him and that his suspicions of her were unfounded. However, now she is married to his enemy and indeed at that moment an illuminated barge appears on the river with wedding guests serenading the newly wedded couple &quot;(Wedding chorus:&quot;Au banquet où le ciel leur apprête&quot;)&quot;. Nevers leads her away in a splendid procession as Catholics and Protestants loudly proclaim their murderous hatred of each other &quot;(Chorus of fighters:&quot;Non, plus de paix ni trêve&quot;)&quot;.

===Act 4===

&quot;A room in Nevers&#x27; Parisian town-house. Family portraits decorate the walls. In the background, a large door and a large Gothic cross. On the left, a door that leads to Valentine&#x27;s bedroom. On the right, a big chimney, and near the chimney the entrance to a room closed by a tapestry. On the right, and in the foreground, a window overlooking the street.&quot;

Valentine, alone, expresses her sorrow at being married to Nevers when she is really in love with Raoul &quot;(Air: &quot;Parmi les pleurs mon rêve se ranime&quot;)&quot;. She is surprised by Raoul who wishes to have one last meeting with her. The sound of approaching people leads Raoul to hide behind a curtain, where he hears the Catholic nobles pledge to murder the Huguenots. They are accompanied by three monks, who bless the swords and daggers to be used in the massacre, declaring it to be God&#x27;s will that the heretics be killed. Only Nevers does not join in the oath &quot;(Conjuration:&quot;Des troubles renaissants&quot;)&quot;. This scene is generally judged the most gripping in the opera, and is accompanied by some of its most dramatic music. When the nobles have departed, Raoul re-appears and is torn between warning his fellows and staying with Valentine &quot;(Duet:&quot;Ô ciel! où courez-vous ?&quot;)&quot;. Valentine is desperate to prevent him from meeting death by going to the assistance of his fellow Protestants and admits she loves him, which sends Raoul into raptures. However they hear the bell of Saint-Germain-l&#x27;Auxerrois ringing, the signal for the massacre to begin, and Valentine faints as Raoul leaps out the window to join his co-religionists.

===Act 5===
&quot;Scene 1: A beautifully lit ballroom in the Hôtel de Nesle&quot;

The Protestants are celebrating the marriage of the Queen to Henry of Navarre. The tolling of a bell interrupts the dancing and festivities, as does the entrance of Raoul, in torn clothing covered in blood, who informs the assembly that the second stroke was the signal for the Catholic massacre of the Huguenots. Admiral Coligny has been assassinated, Raoul tells them, and Protestant men, women and children are being slaughtered in the street by the thousands. The women flee, panic-stricken, as the Protestant men prepare to defend themselves.

&quot;Scene 2: A cemetery: in the background, a Protestant church whose stained glass windows are visible. On the left, a small door that leads into the interior of the church. On the right, a gate that overlooks a crossroads&quot;

Under the leadership of Marcel, Protestant women take refuge with their children in the church. It is there that Raoul finds his old servant, who, resigned, prepares to die. Valentine arrives and tells Raoul that his life will be saved if he agrees to wear a white scarf around his arm, indicating that he is Catholic. She also informs the young man that she is now free, Nevers having been killed after having defended Protestants. Raoul seems to hesitate but finally refuses Valentine&#x27;s proposal to pass as Catholic. She immediately decides to share the fate of the one she loves by abjuring the Catholic faith. She asks Marcel to bless her. Marcel does so and declares the couple married in the sight of God &quot;(Trio: &quot;Savez-vous qu’en joignant vos mains&quot;)&quot;. Meanwhile, the Protestants who barricaded themselves in the church intone Luther&#x27;s hymn &quot;Ein feste Burg&quot;. Suddenly, the singing inside the church is interrupted. The Catholics have broken down the door of the church and threaten to kill all the Protestant women and children if they do not renounce their faith. After refusing, the Protestants resume their singing, interrupted several times by musket shots. Finally, the song is no longer heard: all were massacred. At the height of exaltation, Marcel thinks he hears the march of angels leading the martyrs to God. Valentine and Raoul share this vision of heaven &#x27;with six harps&#x27;. &quot;(Trio: &quot;Ah ! voyez ! Le ciel s’ouvre et rayonne !&quot;)&quot;. Catholic soldiers enter the cemetery, seize Raoul, Valentine and Marcel and drag them away, wounding all three, after they refuse to abjure their faith.

&quot;Scene 3: A street in Paris, on the night of 23 to 24 August 1572&quot;

Wounded, they are finally murdered by St. Bris and his men, he realising only too late that he has killed his own daughter. (Cf. the closing scene of Fromental Halévy&#x27;s opera, &quot;La Juive&quot;, libretto also by Scribe, produced a year earlier than &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;). It is at this moment that Marguerite&#x27;s litter appears. She also recognizes Valentine and tries to stop the massacre, to no avail. A chorus of soldiers, hunting for more Protestants to murder and singing &#x27;God wants blood!&#x27;, brings the opera to a close.

==Analysis==

===Libretto===
In &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, Scribe and Meyerbeer depicted religious fanaticism and sectarianism causing bloody civil division for the first time. The composer Robert Schumann in a scathing review of the piece, objected to the use of the hymn &quot;Ein feste Burg&quot; as a musical theme recurring throughout the opera, and to the depiction of religious division, writing &quot;I am not a moralist, but for a good Protestant it is offensive to hear his most cherished song being yelled on the stage and to see the bloodiest drama in the history of his faith degraded to the level of a fairground farce. Meyerbeer&#x27;s highest ambition is to startle or titillate, and he certainly succeeds in that with the theatre-going rabble.&quot; George Sand at first refused to attend a performance of the opera, saying that she did not want to watch Catholics and Protestants slit each other&#x27;s throats to music written by a Jew. When eventually she did see the piece, however, she was overwhelmed and wrote to Meyerbeer that &quot;Though you are a musician, you are more a poet than any of us!&quot; and called the opera &quot;an evangel of love&quot;.

Franz Liszt observed of the libretto &quot;If one continually reproaches the poet for striving after dramatic effects, it would be unjust not to acknowledge how thrilling these can often be&quot; while Hector Berlioz in his review of the premiere wrote &quot;the new libretto by M. Scribe seems to us to be admirably arranged for music and full of situations of undoubted dramatic interest&quot;.

Some writers have condemned as nothing more than &quot;kitsch melodrama&quot; the central and fictitious love story between Raoul and Valentine, dependent on Raoul&#x27;s mistaken belief that she is Nevers&#x27; mistress, a misunderstanding that goes on for three acts when it could easily have been cleared up much sooner. Other critics have praised the psychological realism of the characters, Ernest Newman, for instance, stating that &quot;Meyerbeer gave his audiences the delighted feeling that they were being brought into touch with real life, and that the characters they saw on the boards were men and women such as they might meet any day themselves.&quot; The character of Marcel, a creation both textually and musically of Meyerbeer, has met particular praise from critics, evolving as he does from the status of intolerant servant in the first act to that of visionary spiritual guide in the last. Liszt wrote &quot;The role of Marcel, the purest type of popular pride and religious sacrifice, seems to us to be the most complete and living character. The unmistakable solemnity of his airs, which expresses so eloquently the moral grandeur of this man of the people, as well as his simplicity, the noble nature of his thought, remains striking from the beginning to the end of the opera.&quot;

Meyerbeer had intended a singing role for the character of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, Queen Mother at the time of the massacre, in the scene of the blessing of the daggers in Act 4, but the state censorship would not permit a royal personage to be depicted in such an unfavourable light.

Victor Hugo, in his preface to &quot;Cromwell&quot; (1827), called for the introduction of local colour into historical dramas. For music critic Robert Letellier, this request is perfectly met by Act 3 of &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, with its strolling promenaders of all classes setting the scene and its squabbles of Catholics and Protestants interrupted by gypsy dancers and fortune-tellers, reminiscent of episodes from Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot; (1831).

Letellier has also written of the masterly way Scribe&#x27;s libretto moves from light to darkness. Act 1 is set in the daytime, in the hedonistic surroundings of a chateau belonging to a pleasure-loving Catholic noble (with one of the musical numbers even marked &quot;The Orgy&quot;.) Act 2 is set in sparkling sunshine in the beautiful countryside. Act 3, with near riots between Catholic and Protestant factions, as dusk falls. Act 4, with the plotting to massacre the Protestants, at night, and Act 5, with the actual massacre, in the darkness of the early hours of the morning.

In the assessment of music historian David Charlton, Scribe and Meyerbeer in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; &quot;created a masterpiece of romantic tragedy&quot;.

===Music===

Reviewing the premiere of the opera, Hector Berlioz wrote &quot;The dramatic expression is always true and profound, with fresh colours, warm movement, elegant forms; in instrumentation, in effects of vocal masses, this score surpasses all that has been attempted to this day.&quot;

One of the most striking innovations is the treatment of Luther&#x27;s chorale &quot;Ein feste Burg&quot; as a leitmotif developed and varied throughout the opera. The theme is present from the outset where it is subject to a series of variations that symbolize, according to Letellier, the feelings inspired by religion: recollection, love, consolation, exaltation, but also intolerance and fanaticism. In the song of Marcel in the first act, it corresponds to an expression of faith, full of conviction and aspiration to transcendence. In the finale of the second act, it is used as a cantus firmus to affirm the resolution and strength of Protestants in the face of danger. In the third act, it is a call to arms to escape traps and betrayals. Finally, in the last act, it becomes the stifled and distant prayer of the Protestants who seek to escape the massacre to become an ultimate cry of defiance against the Catholic executioners and is also sung in unison by Valentine, Raoul and Marcel as they have an ecstatic vision of heaven awaiting them upon their imminent deaths.

Also very innovatory were the huge multiple choruses, as for instance in the Pré-aux-Clercs scene at the start of Act 3, when Protestant soldiers sing a &quot;rataplan&quot; chorus, Catholic girls cross the stage chanting praise to the Virgin with a third chorus of law clerks. These are all first heard separately, then combined and to this mix is then added the wives and girlfriends of the Catholic students and Protestant soldiers hurling abuse at each other. Berlioz marveled that &quot;The richness of texture in the Pré-aux-Clercs scene [of act III] […] was extraordinary, yet the ear could follow it with such ease that every strand in the composer&#x27;s complex thought was continually apparent—a marvel of dramatic counterpoint&#x27;. and said the music in that act &quot;dazzles the ear as bright light does the eye&quot;.

Both Liszt and Berlioz greatly admired the instrumentation of the opera. Liszt wrote that &quot;the orchestral effects are so cleverly combined and diversified that we have never been able to attend a performance of the Huguenots without a new feeling of surprise and admiration for the art of the master who has managed to dye in a thousand shades, almost ungraspable in their delicacy, the rich fabric of his musical poem&quot;.

Meyerbeer used a variety of novel and unusual orchestral effects in the opera. Marcel&#x27;s utterances are usually accompanied by two cellos and a double bass. The composer revived an archaic instrument, the viola d&#x27;amore, which had fallen into complete disuse in the 19th century, for Raoul&#x27;s aria &quot;Plus blanche que la blanche hermine&quot; and used the bass clarinet for the first time in an opera in the scene in the last act during which Marcel &quot;marries&quot; Valentine and Raoul just before they are murdered, creating an other-worldly, funereal effect.

==Influence==

Following five years after Meyerbeer&#x27;s own &quot;Robert le diable&quot; and a year after Fromental Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot;, &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; consolidated the genre of Grand Opera, in which the Paris Opéra would specialise for the next generation, and which became a major box-office attraction for opera houses all over the world. Hector Berlioz&#x27;s contemporary account is full of praise, with &#x27;Meyerbeer in command at the first desk [of violins] [...] from beginning to end I found [the orchestral playing] superb in its beauty and refinement [...] .

The immense success of the opera encouraged many musicians, including Franz Liszt and Sigismond Thalberg, to create virtuosic piano works based on its themes.

A military slow march based on the prelude to &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; is played every year during the ceremony of Trooping the Colour at Horse Guards Parade in London.

<text>Mahajangā (French: Majunga) is a city and an administrative district on the northwest coast of Madagascar. The city of Mahajanga (Mahajanga I) is the capital of the Boeny Region. The district (identical to the city) had a population of 258,068 in 2020.

== City ==

Mahajanga is a seaport, the second most important one in Madagascar after Toamasina. The marine terminal accommodates containerships and small (150 gross ton) general cargo freighters. Because of the limited water depth at the wharf, only small ships can call at the terminal. Deeper-draft ships anchor off the terminal and transfer cargo to and from barges, which move it to and from the terminal.

Severe storms during December 2006 damaged the bulkhead, allowing water to flow in and wash backfill out from under the terminal&#x27;s paving blocks. The resulting collapse of pavement blocks has made operations at the terminal less efficient and reduced the storage space available. The largest and most valuable containerized export is frozen shrimp.

There is an international airport with regional flights to the Comoros and Mayotte.

Mahajanga is on the Betsiboka River, which then leads to Bombetoka Bay.

The city has a sizable Muslim population. In 1977, it was the scene of ethnic unrest, forcing the evacuation of the Comorian minority living there. Mahajanga is also the seat of a Roman Catholic Diocese (Cathedral of the Holy Heart of Mary).

===Baobab===
The African baobab tree near the coast is the largest specimen in Madagascar, having a circumference of , and is the symbol of the city. Its age is unknown, but it is usually said to be 700–800 years old. It was once used as a site of important meetings, and, in the 19th century, as a site for executions. It is said that to honor the Malagasy ancestors, anyone who visits it must walk around it seven times.

==History==
According to Jane Hooper, &quot;Since the tenth century, ports in the north of Madagascar, home to an Islamized population, had attracted merchants and migrants from East Africa, the Middle East, and even the Far East. At least a dozen ports were identified in northern Madagascar by the late fifteenth century by the Arab geographer Ibn Mājid...By the early eighteenth century, Andriamandisoarivo, with the support of his eight-hundred-man army, founded a new Sakalava dynasty in the north which he named Volamena, meaning red money or gold. His descendants were known as the Zafibolamena, children of the Volamena. He died in the northern city of Bezavo around 1710, having cemented his name in traditions as the founder of a powerful new kingdom. His kingdom contained the port of Mazalagem Nova, or Massaliege, already a prosperous center for trade, as well as the new ports of Boina and Mahajanga (Majunga)...One English captain described the northwestern town of Mahajanga as a bustling, cosmopolitan port in 1764. He wrote that the town, built “after the Indian fashion,” contained many stone buildings and mosques. Inhabited by “native” Muslims and others from “Surate, Johana, Mosembeck, and the Commoro islands,” Mahajanga was clearly a prosperous and cosmopolitan port. Within the city, the Sakalava rulers allowed Muslims to practice their religion freely. In return, the Sakalava instituted a series of trading controls. The king appointed a “purser authorized to carry trade on in the king’s name, in conjunction with another purser that comes down from the king.” Sakalava kings and queens even allowed visiting European merchants to trade with local Muslim merchants as well as with Sakalava representatives and appeared to be increasingly tapped into these networks crossing the southwestern Indian Ocean region. A Sakalava queen married an East African (or Comorian) man around the middle of the eighteenth century, according to English and Dutch reports. Sakalava kings and queens also incorporated Islamic beliefs and rituals into their practice of divine kingship and some converted to Islam by the early nineteenth century.&quot;

=== Indian community ===
In the 1780s, a community of roughly 200 Muslim traders from the Indian Subcontinent had formed at Mahajanga at the mouth of the Betsiboka River, according to French traveler Dumaine. Thus, the etymology of the word &quot;Mahajanga&quot; may be Indic. Confusion arose over their legal status; they often declared themselves to be Malagasy subjects to evade the laws against slave-holding or the building of stone houses, both forbidden to British subjects. Their dhows, which they used to transport goods to and from the African mainland, flew French flags. Initial arrivals were mainly Muslim Khojas, Ismailis and Da&#x27;udi Bohras, with some Hindus settling later.

The 1911 census found 4,480 Indians in the country, making them 21% of the total foreign population and the second-largest foreign population, after the French. Following the nationalisation of private businesses in the 1970s, many of them were compelled to leave; those who remained were largely uneducated, but stayed on and gradually built their businesses. By 2000, they were generally believed to control 50-60% of the country&#x27;s economy, making them the target of demonstrators during periods of unrest.

In December 2006, a cyclone hit Mahajanga, causing significant damage to the port facilities and to some buildings on or near the coast.

===Military history===
The city has an airfield which the British used to station Shackleton aircraft to support the Beira Patrol from May 1966.

== Region ==
Mahajanga is the capital city of the Boeny Region.
== Notable people==
Ali Soilih (1937 – 1978) a Comorian socialist revolutionary and political figure who served as the Dictator of the State of the Comoros from 3 January 1976 to 13 May 1978.

==Sports==
*Fosa Juniors FC is the local football club.
*ASCB Boeny (basketball) - Malagasy champions 2017

The stadium Jacques Rabemananjara, with its 8,000 places, is the 5th largest in the country.

== Climate ==
Mahajanga has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;) with two distinct seasons: a humid, rainy wet season from November to mid-April, and a sunny, less humid and practically bone-dry dry season for the remaining six-and-a-half months. Cyclones can occur during the wet season, producing very heavy rain and extensive erosion.
== Education ==
The University of Mahajanga is located in Ambondrona campus.

<doc id="377892" wikidata="Q1323450" url="?curid=377892" title="Ekphrasis">
<text>The word ekphrasis, or ecphrasis, comes from the Greek for the written description of a work of art produced as a rhetorical or literary exercise, often used in the adjectival form ekphrastic. It is a vivid, often dramatic, verbal description of a visual work of art, either real or imagined. Thus, &quot;an ekphrastic poem is a vivid description of a scene or, more commonly, a work of art.&quot; In ancient times, it might refer more broadly to a description of any thing, person, or experience. The word comes from the Greek ἐκ &quot;ek&quot; and φράσις &quot;phrásis&quot;, &#x27;out&#x27; and &#x27;speak&#x27; respectively, and the verb ἐκφράζειν &quot;ekphrázein&quot;, &#x27;to proclaim or call an inanimate object by name&#x27;.

The works of art described or evoked may be real or imagined; and this may be difficult to discern. Ancient ekphrastic writing can be useful evidence for art historians, especially for paintings, as virtually no original Greco-Roman examples survive.

Ekphrasis has been considered generally to be a rhetorical device in which one medium of art tries to relate to another medium by defining and describing its essence and form, and in doing so, relate more directly to the audience, through its illuminative liveliness.

A descriptive work of prose or poetry, a film, or even a photograph may highlight through its &quot;rhetorical&quot; vividness what is happening or what is shown. For example, in the visual arts, it may enhance the original art and so take on a life of its own through its brilliant description. One example is a painting of a sculpture: the painting is &quot;telling the story of&quot; the sculpture, and so becoming a storyteller, as well as a story (work of art) itself. Virtually any type of artistic medium may be the actor of or subject of ekphrasis. Although, for example, it may not be possible to make an accurate sculpture of a book to retell the story in an authentic way, it is the spirit of the book that may be conveyed by virtually any medium and thereby enhance the artistic impact of the original book through synergy.

== History ==

=== Plato&#x27;s forms, the beginning of ekphrasis ===
In the &quot;Republic&quot;, Book X, Plato discusses forms by using real things, such as a bed, for example, and calls each way a bed has been made a &quot;bedness&quot;. He commences with the original form of a bed, one of a variety of ways a bed may have been constructed by a craftsman and compares that form with an ideal form of a bed, of a perfect archetype or image in the form of which beds ought to be made; in short, the epitome of bedness.

In his analogy, one bedness form shares its own bedness – with all its shortcomings – with that of the ideal form, or template. A third bedness, too, may share the ideal form. He continues with the fourth form also containing elements of the ideal template or archetype which in this way remains an ever-present and invisible ideal version with which the craftsman compares his work. As bedness after bedness shares the ideal form and template of all creation of beds, and each bedness is associated with another ad infinitum, it is called an &quot;infinite regress of forms&quot;.

=== From form to ekphrasis ===
It was this epitome, this template of the ideal form, that a craftsman or later an artist would try to reconstruct in his attempt to achieve perfection in his work, that was to manifest itself in ekphrasis at a later stage.

Artists began to use their own literary and artistic genre of art to work and reflect on another art to illuminate what the eye might not see in the original, to elevate it and possibly even surpass it.

=== Plato and Aristotle ===
For Plato (and Aristotle), it is not so much the form of each bed that defines &quot;bedness&quot; as the mimetic stages at which beds may be viewed that defines &quot;bedness&quot;.
# a bed as a physical entity is a mere form of bed
# any view from whichever perspective, be it a side elevation, a full panoramic view from above, or looking at a bed end-on is at a second remove
# a full picture, characterizing the whole bed is at a third remove
# ekphrasis of a bed in another art form is at a fourth remove

=== Socrates and Phaedrus ===
In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, Socrates talks about ekphrasis to Phaedrus, saying:
:&quot;You know, Phaedrus, that is the strange thing about writing, which makes it truly correspond to painting. The painter&#x27;s products stand before us as though they were alive, but if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence. It is the same with written words; they seem to talk to you as if they were intelligent, but if you ask them anything about what they say, from a desire to be instructed, they go on telling you just the same thing forever&quot;.

== Genre ==

=== In literature ===
The fullest example of ekphrasis in antiquity can be found in Philostratus of Lemnos&#x27; &quot;Eikones&quot; which describes 64 pictures in a Neapolitan villa. Modern critics have debated as to whether the paintings described should be considered as real or imagined, or the reader left uncertain. Ekphrasis is described in Aphthonius&#x27; &quot;Progymnasmata&quot;, his textbook of style, and later classical literary and rhetorical textbooks, and with other classical literary techniques. It was keenly revived in the Renaissance.

In the Middle Ages, ekphrasis was less often practiced, especially regarding real objects. Historians of medieval art have complained that the accounts of monastic chronicles recording now vanished art concentrate on objects made from valuable materials or with the status of relics. They rarely give more than the cost and weight of objects, and perhaps a mention of the subject matter of the iconography.

The Renaissance and Baroque periods made much use of ekphrasis, typically mainly of imagined works. In Renaissance Italy, Canto 33 of Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; describes a picture gallery created by Merlin. In Spain, the playwright Lope de Vega often used allusions and descriptions of Italian art in his works, and included the painter Titian as one of his characters. Calderón de la Barca also incorporated works of art in dramas such as &quot;The Painter of his Dishonor&quot;. Miguel de Cervantes, who spent his youth in Italy, used many Renaissance frescoes and paintings in &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and many of his other works. In England, Shakespeare briefly describes a group of erotic paintings in &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, but his most extended exercise is a 200-line description of the Greek army before Troy in &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;. Ekphrasis seems to have been less common in France during these periods.

Instances of ekphrasis in 19th century literature can be found in the works of such influential figures as Spanish novelist Benito Pérez Galdós, French poet, painter and novelist Théophile Gautier, Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, and Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot; features an intense use of ekphrasis as a stylistic manifesto of the book in which it appears. In the chapter &quot;The Spouter Inn&quot;, a painting hanging on the wall of a whaler&#x27;s inn is described as irreconcilably unclear, overscrawled with smoke and defacements. The narrator describes how this painting can be both lacking any definition and still provoking in the viewer dozens of distinct possible understandings, until the great mass of interpretations resolves into a Whale. This grounds all the interpretations while containing them, an indication of how Melville sees his own book unfolding around this chapter.

Peter Bly has described the many uses of art in the works of Benito Pérez Galdós. For example, in &quot;La incógnita&quot; (1889), there are many allusions and descriptions of Italian art, including references to Botticelli, Mantegna, Masaccio, Raphael, Titian, and others. In &quot;Our Friend Manso&quot; (1882), the narrator describes two paintings by Théodore Géricault to point to the shipwreck of ideals. In this novel, as well as in &quot;Miau&quot; (1888), as Frederick A. de Armas has pointed out, there are numerous allusive ekphrasis to paintings of Bartholomew the Apostle.

In Ibsen&#x27;s 1888 work &quot;The Lady from the Sea&quot;, the first act begins with the description of a painting of a mermaid dying on the shore and is followed by a description of a sculpture that depicts a woman having a nightmare of an ex-lover returning to her. Both works of art can be interpreted as having much importance in the overall meaning of the play as protagonist Ellida Wangel both yearns for her lost youth spent on an island out at sea and is later in the play visited by a lover she thought dead. Furthermore, as an interesting example of the back-and-forth dynamic that exists between literary ekphrasis and art, in 1896 (eight years after the play was written) Norwegian painter Edvard Munch painted an image similar to the one described by Ibsen in a painting he also entitled &quot;Lady from the Sea&quot;. Ibsen&#x27;s last work, &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot;, also contains examples of ekphrasis; the play&#x27;s protagonist, Arnold Rubek, is a sculptor. Several times throughout the play he describes his masterpiece &quot;Resurrection Day&quot; at length and in the many different forms the sculpture took throughout the stages of its creation. Once again the evolution of the sculpture as described in the play can be read as a reflection on the transformation undergone by Rubek himself and even as a statement on the progression Ibsen&#x27;s own plays took. Many scholars have read this final play (stated by Ibsen himself to be an &#x27;epilogue&#x27;) as the playwright&#x27;s reflection on his own work as an artist.

The Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky employed ekphrasis most notably in his novel &quot;The Idiot&quot;. In this novel, the protagonist, Prince Myshkin, sees a painting of a dead Christ in the house of Rogozhin that has a profound effect on him. Later in the novel, another character, Hippolite, describes the painting at much length depicting the image of Christ as one of brutal realism that lacks any beauty or sense of the divine. Rogozhin, who is himself the owner of the painting, at one moment says that the painting has the power to take away a man&#x27;s faith. This is a comment that Dostoyevsky himself made to his wife Anna upon seeing the actual painting that the painting in the novel is based on, &quot;The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb&quot; by Hans Holbein. The painting was seen shortly before Dostoyevsky began the novel. Though this is the major instance of ekphrasis in the novel, and the one which has the most thematic importance to the story as a whole, other instances can be spotted when Prince Myshkin sees a painting of Swiss landscape that reminds him of a view he saw while at a sanatorium in Switzerland, and also when he first sees the face of his love interest, Nastasya, in the form of a painted portrait. At one point in the novel, Nastasya, too, describes a painting of Christ, her own imaginary work that portrays Christ with a child, an image which naturally evokes comparison between the image of the dead Christ.

The Irish aesthete and novelist Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1890/1891) tells how Basil Hallward paints a picture of the young man named Dorian Gray. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, who espouses a new hedonism, dedicated to the pursuit of beauty and all pleasures of the senses. Under his sway, Dorian bemoans the fact that his youth will soon fade. He would sell his soul so as to have the portrait age rather than himself. As Dorian engages in a debauched life, the gradual deterioration of the portrait becomes a mirror of his soul. There are repeated instances of notional ekphrasis of the deteriorating figure in the painting throughout the novel, although these are often partial, leaving much of the portrait&#x27;s imagery to the imagination. The novel forms part of the magic portrait genre. Wilde had previously experimented with employing portraits in his written work, as in &quot;The Portrait of Mr. W. H.&quot; (1889).

Anthony Powell&#x27;s novel sequence &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot; begins with an evocation of the painting by Poussin which gives the sequence its name, and contains other passages of ekphrasis, perhaps influenced by the many passages in Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

In the 20th century, Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai&quot; uses an ekphrastic frame, descriptions of Hokusai&#x27;s famous series of woodcuts, as a structural device for his story. In her novel &quot;Skyline&quot; the South African-Italian Patricia Schonstein concludes each chapter with an art curator&#x27;s description of a naïve work of art as a means of introducing additional narrative voices.

Ekphrasis and the uses of art, architecture and music are also of utmost importance in the modern Latin American novel, and particularly in the works of Alejo Carpentier as Steve Wakefield attests. In one of his early novels, &quot;The Kingdom of this World&quot; (1949), a character views a collection of statues at the Villa Borghese, culminating with the Venus Victrix. The art collection of the tyrant in &quot;Reasons of State&quot; is another example.

==== Ekphrastic poetry ====

Ekphrastic poetry may be encountered as early as the days of Homer, whose &quot;Iliad&quot; (Book 18) describes the Shield of Achilles, with how Hephaestus made it as well as its completed shape. Famous later examples are found in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, for instance the description of what Aeneas sees engraved on the doors of Carthage&#x27;s temple of Juno, and Catullus 64, which contains an extended ekphrasis of an imaginary coverlet with the story of Ariadne picked out on it.

Ekphrastic poetry flourished in the Romantic era and again among the pre-Raphaelite poets. A major poem of the English Romantics – &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; by John Keats – provides an example of the artistic potential of ekphrasis. The entire poem is a description of a piece of pottery that the narrator finds evocative. Felicia Hemans made extensive use of ekphrasis, as did Letitia Elizabeth Landon, especially in her &quot;Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures&quot;. Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;double-works&quot; exemplify the use of the genre by an artist mutually to enhance his visual and literary art. Rossetti also ekphrasized a number of paintings by other artists, generally from the Italian Renaissance, such as Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot;.

Other examples of the genre from the nineteenth century include Michael Field&#x27;s 1892 volume &quot;Sight and Song&quot;, which contains only ekphrastic poetry; Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s poem &quot;Before the Mirror&quot;, which ekphrasizes James Abbott McNeill Whistler&#x27;s &quot;Symphony in White, No. 2: The Little White Girl&quot;, hinted at only by the poem&#x27;s subtitle, &quot;Verses Written under a Picture&quot;; and Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;My Last Duchess&quot;, which although a dramatic monologue, includes some description by the duke of the portrait before which he and the listener stand.

Ekphrastic poetry is still commonly practiced. Twentieth-century examples include Rainer Maria Rilke&#x27;s &quot;Archaic Torso of Apollo&quot;, and &quot;The Shield of Achilles&quot; (1952), a poem by W. H. Auden, which brings the tradition back to its start with an ironic retelling of the episode in Homer (see above), where Thetis finds very different scenes from those she expects. In contrast, his earlier poem &quot;Musée des Beaux Arts&quot; describes a particular real and famous painting, &quot;Landscape with the Fall of Icarus&quot;, thought until recently to be by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, and now believed to be &quot;after&quot; him, is also described in the poem by William Carlos Williams &quot;Landscape with the Fall of Icarus&quot;. The paintings of Edward Hopper have inspired many ekphrastic poems, including a prize-winning volume in French by Claude Esteban (&quot;Soleil dans une pièce vide&quot;, &quot;Sun in an Empty Room&quot;, 1991), a collection in Catalan by Ernest Farrés (&quot;Edward Hopper&quot;, 2006, English translation 2010 by Lawrence Venuti), an English collection by James Hoggard &quot;Triangles of Light: The Edward Hopper Poems&quot; (Wings Press, 2009), and a collection by various poets (&quot;The Poetry of Solitude: A Tribute to Edward Hopper&quot;, 1995, editor Gail Levin), together with numerous individual poems; see more at .

The poet Gabriele Tinti has composed a series of poems for ancient works of art, including the &quot;Boxer at Rest&quot;, the &quot;Discobolus&quot;, the &quot;Arundel Head&quot;, the &quot;Ludovisi Gaul&quot;, the &quot;Victorious Youth&quot;, the &quot;Farnese Hercules&quot;, the Hercules by Scopas, the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon, the &quot;Barberini Faun&quot;, the &quot;Doryphoros&quot;.

=== In, or as, art history ===

Since the types of objects described in classical ekphrases often lack survivors to modern times, art historians have often been tempted to use descriptions in literature as sources for the appearance of actual Greek or Roman art, an approach full of risk. This is because ekphrasis typically contains an element of competition with the art it describes, aiming to demonstrate the superior ability of words to &quot;paint a picture&quot;. Many subjects of ekphrasis are clearly imaginary, for example those of the epics, but with others it remains uncertain the extent to which they were, or were expected to be by early audiences, at all accurate.

This tendency is not restricted to classical art history; the evocative but vague mentions of objects in metalwork in &quot;Beowulf&quot; are eventually always mentioned by writers on Anglo-Saxon art, and compared to the treasures of Sutton Hoo and the Staffordshire Hoard. The ekphrasic writings of the lawyer turned bishop Asterius of Amasea (fl. around 400) are often cited by art historians of the period to fill gaps in the surviving artistic record. The inadequacy of most medieval accounts of art is mentioned above; they generally lack any specific details other than cost and the owner or donor, and hyperbolic but wholly vague praise.

Journalistic art criticism was effectively invented by Denis Diderot in his long pieces on the works in the Paris Salon, and extended and highly pointed accounts of the major exhibitions of new art became a popular seasonal feature in the journalism of most Western countries. Since few if any of the works could be illustrated, description and evocation was necessary, and the criticality of descriptions of works disliked became a part of the style.

As art history began to become an academic subject in the 19th century, ekphrasis as formal analysis of objects was regarded as a vital component of the subject. Not all examples lack attractiveness as literature. Writers on art for a wider audience produced many descriptions with great literary as well as art historical merit; in English John Ruskin, both the most important journalistic critic and popularizer of historic art of his day, and Walter Pater, above all for his famous evocation of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, are among the most notable. As photography in books or on television allowed audiences a direct visual comparison to the verbal description, the role of ekphrasic commentary on the images may have increased.

Ekphrasis has also been an influence on art; for example the ekphrasis of the Shield of Achilles in Homer and other classical examples are likely to have inspired the elaborately decorated large serving dishes in silver or silver-gilt, crowded with complicated scenes in relief, that were produced in 16th century Mannerist metalwork.

=== In music ===

There are a number of examples of ekphrasis in music, of which the best known is probably &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, a suite in ten movements (plus a recurring, varied Promenade) composed for piano by the Russian composer Modest Mussorgsky in 1874, and then very popular in various arrangements for orchestra. The suite is based on real pictures, although as the exhibition was dispersed, most are now unidentified.

The first movement of &quot;Three Places in New England&quot; by Charles Ives is an ekphrasis of the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial in Boston, sculpted by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Ives also wrote a poem inspired by the sculpture as a companion piece to the music. Rachmaninoff&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; is a musical evocation of Böcklin&#x27;s painting of the same name. King Crimson&#x27;s song &quot;The Night Watch&quot;, with lyrics written by Richard Palmer-James, is an ekphrasis on Rembrandt&#x27;s painting &quot;The Night Watch&quot;.

=== Notional ekphrasis ===

Notional ekphrasis may describe mental processes such as dreams, thoughts and whimsies of the imagination. It may also be one art describing or depicting another work of art which as yet is still in an inchoate state of creation, in that the work described may still be resting in the imagination of the artist before he has begun his creative work. The expression may also be applied to an art describing the origin of another art, how it came to be made and the circumstances of its being created. Finally it may describe an entirely imaginary and non-existing work of art, as though it were factual and existed in reality.

== In ancient literature ==

=== Greek literature ===

==== &quot;The Iliad&quot; ====

The shield of Achilles is described by Homer in an example of ekphrastic poetry, used to depict events that have occurred in the past and events that will occur in the future. The shield contains images representative of the Cosmos and the inevitable fate of the city of Troy. The shield of Achilles features the following nine depictions:
# The Earth, Sea, Sky, Moon and the Cosmos (484–89)
# Two cities – one where a wedding and a trial are taking place, and one that is considered to be Troy, due to the battle occurring inside the city (509–40)
# A field that is being ploughed (541–49)
# The home of a King where the harvest is being reaped (550–60)
# A vineyard that is being harvested (561–72)
# A herd of cattle that is being attacked by two lions, while the Herdsman and his dogs try to scare the lions off the prize bull (573–86)
# A sheep farm (587–89)
# A scene with young men and women dancing (590–606)
# The mighty Ocean as it encircles the shield (607–609)

==== &quot;The Odyssey&quot; ====

Although not written as elaborately as previous examples of ekphrastic poetry, from lines 609–614 the belt of Herakles is described as having &quot;marvelous works,&quot; such as animals with piercing eyes and hogs in a grove of trees. It also contains multiple images of battles and occurrences of manslaughter. In &quot;the Odyssey,&quot; there is also a scene where Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, must prove to his wife, Penelope, that he has proof that Odysseus is still alive. She asks him about the clothes Odysseus was wearing during the time when the beggar claims he hosted Odysseus. Homer uses this opportunity to implement more ekphrastic imagery by describing the golden brooch of Odysseus, which depicts a hound strangling a fawn that it captured.

==== &quot;The Argonautika&quot; ====

The Cloak of Jason is another example of ekphrastic poetry. In &quot;The Argonautika&quot;, Jason&#x27;s cloak has seven events embroidered into it:

# The forging of Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts by the Cyclops (730-734)
# The building of Thebes by the sons of Antiope (735–741)
# Aphrodite with the shield of Ares (742–745)
# The battle between Teleboans and the Sons of Electryon (746–751)
# Pelops winning Hippodameia (752–758)
# Apollo punishing Tityos (759–762)
# Phrixus and the Ram (763–765)

The description of the cloak provides many examples of ekphrasis, and not only is modeled on Homer&#x27;s writing, but alludes to several occurrences in Homer&#x27;s epics &quot;the Iliad&quot; and &quot;the Odyssey&quot;. Jason&#x27;s cloak can be examined in many ways. The way the cloak&#x27;s events are described is similar to the catalogue of Women that Odysseus encounters on his trip to the Underworld.

The cloak and its depicted events lend more to the story than a simple description; in true ekphrasis fashion it not only compares Jason to future heroes such as Achilles and Odysseus, but also provides a type of foreshadowing. Jason, by donning the cloak, can be seen as a figure who would rather resort to coercion, making him a parallel to Odysseus, who uses schemes and lies to complete his voyage back to Ithaca.

Jason also bears similarities to Achilles: by donning the cloak, Jason is represented as an Achillean heroic figure due to the comparisons made between his cloak and the shield of Achilles. He also takes up a spear given to him by Atalanta, not as an afterthought, but due to his heroic nature and the comparison between himself and Achilles.

While Jason only wears the cloak while going to meet with Hypsipyle, it foreshadows the changes that Jason will potentially undergo during his adventure. Through the telling of the scenes on the cloak, Apollonios relates the scenes on the cloak as virtues and morals that should be upheld by the Roman people, and that Jason should learn to live by. Such virtues include the piety represented by the Cyclops during the forging of Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts. This is also reminiscent of the scene in &quot;the Iliad&quot; when Thetis goes to see Hephaestus, and requisitions him to create a new set of armor for her son Achilles. Before he began creating the shield and armor, Hephaestus was forging 20 golden tripods for his own hall, and in the scene on Jason&#x27;s cloak we see the Cyclops performing the last step of creating the thunderbolts for Zeus.

=== Roman literature ===

==== &quot;The Aeneid&quot; ====

&quot;The Aeneid&quot; is an epic that was written by Virgil during the reign of Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome. While the epic itself mimics Homer&#x27;s works, it can be seen as propaganda for Augustus and the new Roman empire. The shield of Aeneas is described in book eight, from lines 629–719. This shield was given to him by his mother, Venus, after she asked her husband Vulcan to create it. This scene is almost identical to Thetis, the mother of Achilles, asking Hephaestus to create her son new weapons and armor for the battle of Troy.

The difference in the descriptions of the two shields are easily discernible; the shield of Achilles depicts many subjects, whereas the shield made for Aeneas depicts the future that Rome will have, containing propaganda in favor of the Emperor Augustus. Much like other ekphrastic poetry, it depicts a clear catalogue of events:

# The She Wolf and the suckling Romulus and Remus (629–634)
# The Rape of the Sabine Women (635–639)
# Mettius pulled apart by horses (640–645)
# Invasion of Lars Parsona (646–651)
# Manlius guarding the capitol (652–654)
# Gauls invading Rome (655–665)
# Tartarus with Cato and Catiline (666–670)
# The Sea around the width of the shield (671–674)
# The Battle of Actium (675–677)
# Augustus and Agrippa (678–684)
# Antony and Cleopatra (685–695)
# Triumph (696–719)

There is speculation as to why Virgil depicted certain events, while completely avoiding others such as Julius Caesar&#x27;s conquest of Gaul. Virgil clearly outlined the shield chronologically, but scholars argue that the events on the shield are meant to reflect certain Roman values that would have been of high importance to the Roman people and to the Emperor. These values may include &quot;virtus, clementia, iustitia&quot;, and &quot;pietas&quot;, which were the values inscribed on a shield given to Augustus by the Senate. This instance of ekphrasitc poetry may be Virgil&#x27;s attempt to relate more of his work to Augustus.

Earlier in the epic, when Aeneas travels to Carthage, he sees the temple of the city, and on it are great works of art that are described by the poet using the ekphrastic style. Like the other occurrences of ekphrasis, these works of art describe multiple events. Out of these, there are eight images related to the Trojan War:

# Depictions of Agamemnon and Menelaus, Priam and Achilles (459)
# Greeks running from Trojan soldiers (468)
# The sacking of the tents of Rhesus and the Thracians, and their deaths by Diomedes (468–472)
# Troilus being thrown from his Chariot as he flees from Achilles (473–478)
# The women of Troy in lamentation, praying to the gods to help them (479–482)
# Achilles selling Hektor&#x27;s body (483–487)
# Priam begging for the return of his son, with the Trojan commanders nearby (483–488)
# Penthesilea the Amazon, and her fighters (489–493)

Another significant ekphrasis in the Aeneid appears on the baldric of Pallas (Aeneid X.495-505). The baldric is decorated with the murder of the sons of Aegyptus by their cousins, the Danaïds, a tale dramatized by Aeschylus. Pallas is killed by the warrior Turnus, who plunders and wears the baldric. At the climax of the poem, when Aeneas is on the point of sparing Turnus&#x27;s life, the sight of the baldric changes the hero&#x27;s mind. The significance of the ekphrasis is hotly debated.

==== &quot;The Metamorphoses&quot; ====

There are several examples of ekphrasis in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;; one in which Phaeton journeys to the temple of the sun to meet his father Phoebus. When Phaeton gazes upon the temple of the sun, he sees the following carvings:
# The seas that circle the Earth, the surrounding lands, and the sky (8–9)
# The gods of the sea and the Nymphs (10–19)
# Scenes of men, beasts, and local gods (20–21)
# Twelve figures of the Zodiac, six on each side of the door to the temple (22–23)

== Other aspects ==

=== Educational value of using ekphrasis in teaching literature ===

The rationale behind using examples of ekphrasis to teach literature is that once the connection between a poem and a painting are recognized, for example, the student&#x27;s emotional and intellectual engagement with the literary text is extended to new dimensions. The literary text takes on new meaning and there is more to respond to because another art form is being evaluated. In addition, as the material taught has both a visual and linguistic basis new connections of understanding are formed in the student&#x27;s brain thus creating a stronger foundation for understanding, remembrance and internalization. Using ekphrasis to teach literature can be done through the use of higher order thinking skills such as distinguishing different perspectives, interpreting, inferring, sequencing, compare and contrast and evaluating.

<text>Phil Lesh and Friends was an American rock band formed and led by Phil Lesh, former bassist of the Grateful Dead.

Phil &amp; Friends is not a traditional group in that several different lineups of musicians have played under the name, including groups featuring members of Phish, the Black Crowes, and the Allman Brothers Band.

==Music==
The Phil &amp; Friends concept takes the music of the Grateful Dead (and an ever-increasing number of other influences, including Bob Dylan, Traffic, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Warren Haynes&#x27; band Gov&#x27;t Mule, the Allman Brothers Band, etc.) and explores and interprets it in new ways. Through the period known as the Quintet years (see below), a Phil &amp; Friends show was often focused on harder, faster rock than that which the Grateful Dead played, thanks in large part to Haynes&#x27; and Jimmy Herring&#x27;s talents at the Southern rock style. Lesh was fond of calling it &quot;Dixieland-style rock&quot;. However, all of the incarnations of Phil &amp; Friends have followed a trend of &quot;updating&quot; the Grateful Dead&#x27;s body of work, and all have been adept at the long, exploratory jams that were a trademark of the Grateful Dead. Phil &amp; Friends has been acclaimed for giving new life to the Grateful Dead&#x27;s material, bringing in new styles and innovations, while at the same time remaining loyal to the original music and the original fans. It is this melding of musical influences that has given them wide appeal not only among old Deadheads, but the modern-day fans of other jam bands as well.

Phil &amp; Friends has continued the Grateful Dead&#x27;s tradition of allowing fans to record concerts, and trade these recordings freely. The Internet has been an invaluable source for these tapers to disseminate this music through various sources, including Archive.org and the BitTorrent file-sharing network. Phil has also embraced the Internet by providing free soundboard recordings of many concerts through his website, even providing high-resolution CD covers for fans to print. For his Summer 2006 tour, Phil partnered with Instant Live, a company that was able to provide soundboard CDs of a concert immediately upon its finishing, as well as make these recordings available for fans to download online, though this service was not free.

==History==
===Original Phil Lesh and Friends===
The first use of the Phil Lesh and Friends banner was on September 24, 1994, at the Berkeley Community Theatre. The band was an acoustic version of the Grateful Dead and featured members Phil Lesh, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir and Vince Welnick. Grateful Dead drummers Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart were not part of the band. After this gig the band name was put to rest until Phil formed a new band in 1998.

===1998–2000 permutations===
In 1998, Lesh played with a rotating cast of musicians under the Phil Lesh and Friends name, mostly at San Francisco&#x27;s The Fillmore. Bob Weir, Steve Kimock, Jeff Chimenti, Dave Ellis, Prairie Prince, Scott Amendola, Stan Franks, Gary Lambert, Bobby Strickland and Vince Welnick were among the musicians who participated in the gigs.
From April 1999 to September 2000, Lesh toured with a regularly rotating lineup of musicians that included Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, Jorma Kaukonen, Jimmy Herring, Robben Ford, and members of Phish, Little Feat, The String Cheese Incident and Moe.

The opening concerts on April 15, 16, and 17, 1999 featured Phil along with John Molo on drums, Steve Kimock on guitar, and two members of Phish – Trey Anastasio on guitar and Page McConnell on keys.

After these opening concerts and until October 1999, Phil kept the same &quot;core&quot; of himself and Kimock, and generally Molo as well, while regularly rotating in new musicians on guitar and keys (and sometimes additional instruments). Over this period, the lineups included:

*May 29, 1999: Warren Haynes (guitar and vocals), Merl Saunders (keys), Donna Jean Godchaux (vocals)
*June 4–5, 1999: Prairie Prince (drums), Jorma Kaukonen (guitar and vocals), Pete Sears (keys), Zoe Ellis (vocals), Caitlin Cornwell (vocals)
*July 2–3, 1999: Bill Kreutzmann (drums), David Nelson (guitar and vocals), Barry Sless (guitar), Mookie Siegel (keys)
*August 12–22, 1999: This series of shows generally featured Warren Haynes on guitar and vocals and Kyle Hollingsworth from The String Cheese Incident on keys. Other members of The String Cheese Incident (Michael Kang (mandolin and violin), Bill Nershi (guitar)) occasionally joined the group, as did Al Schnier of Moe.
*October 7–9, 1999: Bobby Strickland (horns), Jeff Mattson (guitar and vocals), Rob Barraco (keys and vocals)
*October 21–27, 1999: This series of shows featured members of Little Feat -- Bill Payne (keys and vocals), Paul Barrere (guitar and vocals)

:Steve Kimock left the tour on October 29, 1999, and Derek Trucks joined a few days later.
* October 29–30, 1999: Bill Payne (keys and vocals), Paul Barrere (guitar and vocals)
* October 31, 1999: Derek Trucks (guitar), Bill Payne (keys and vocals), Paul Barrere (guitar and vocals)

From November 1999 onwards, the &quot;core&quot; of the group was Phil, John Molo, and Rob Barraco on keys (except where noted)

*November 2–14, 1999: Derek Trucks (guitar), Warren Haynes (guitar and vocals);
*November 15, 1999: Derek Trucks (guitar), Warren Haynes (guitar and vocals), Jorma Kaukonen (guitar and vocals);
*November 17–18, 1999: Warren Haynes (guitar and vocals), Jorma Kaukonen (guitar and vocals);
*March 10, 2000: Robben Ford (guitar and vocals), Bill Payne (keys and vocals), Paul Barrere (guitar and vocals)
*April 6-May 27, 2000: Jeff Pevar (guitar and vocals), Jimmy Herring (guitar)

For the summer 2000 tour, the lineup primarily consistent of Robben Ford and members of Little Feat

*June 12–July 15, 2000: Robben Ford (guitar and vocals), Paul Barrere (guitar and vocals), Bill Payne (keys and vocals)
*July 16–18, 2000: Jimmy Herring (guitar), Paul Barrere (guitar and vocals), Bill Payne (keys and vocals)
*July 19–30, 2000: Robben Ford (guitar and vocals), Paul Barrere (guitar and vocals), Bill Payne (keys and vocals)

=== The Phil Lesh Quintet ===

The most permanent of the Phil Lesh and Friends lineups, known as the Phil Lesh Quintet (PLQ or just &quot;the Q&quot; for short) played on a mostly-regular basis from September 2000 through December 2003. The members of this incarnation were Lesh, Warren Haynes (guitar &amp; vocals; also of Gov&#x27;t Mule and Allman Brothers Band), Jimmy Herring (guitar; the Allman Brothers Band, Aquarium Rescue Unit, and most recently Widespread Panic), Rob Barraco (keyboards; the Dead, the Zen Tricksters, Dark Star Orchestra) and John Molo (drums; Bruce Hornsby and the Range, the Other Ones, Modereko, Keller Williams, David Nelson Band, Jemimah Puddleduck, and John Fogerty).

This lineup released the only Phil Lesh and Friends studio album, &quot;There and Back Again&quot;, on Columbia Records in 2002. It included several new songs from Lesh and Robert Hunter, longtime Grateful Dead lyricist, as well as one recent favorite from Jerry Garcia and Hunter, and several original contributions from Haynes, Barraco/Mattson and Herring.

During the summer tour of 2001, the band performed a series of instrumental numbers composed by Lesh. The songs were inspired by the solar system. While they were never officially released on an album, they have come to be known as the &quot;Planet Jams&quot;. A bootleg compilation of these songs has been circulating since then.

===Post Quintet Era===
Ryan Adams started performing with the band in June 2005 after meeting Lesh at the Jammys, followed by Chris Robinson in November/December 2005.

===2006===
During 2006, Phil Lesh and Friends consisted of a core of musicians including Lesh, Larry Campbell (guitar, violin, slide guitar, mandolin, and vocals), Joan Osborne (vocals), Rob Barraco (keyboards and vocals), and John Molo (drums). On the first half of the summer tour, they were joined by John Scofield (guitar), and on the second half, by Barry Sless (pedal steel) and, during the third quarter of the tour and generally for the second set, by Trey Anastasio. Saxophonist Greg Osby joined the group for various concerts, particularly toward the end of the tour, and guest artists including Page McConnell and Dickey Betts sat in for individual sets.

Concerts with Scofield had a jazzy, astringent quality. Anastasio contributed a strong rock lead guitar to the sets he played in, while Sless brought a softer, more lyrical quality. The relative lack of comment about these lineups compared to the earlier &quot;Quintet&quot; and later 2007-8 configuration suggests that they were not as popular with Lesh&#x27;s core fan base, but they gave unique and varied interpretations to some of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s classics along with numerous other songs. Furthermore, the fact that the entire tour was distributed online and later via Instant Live CDs, and a live DVD was made of an early concert at the Warfield (with Scofield and Osby), meant that the various configurations of the year&#x27;s lineup left a larger body of recorded work than many groups that worked together for years.

===2007–2008===

A new formation of Phil &amp; Friends, including Lesh, Larry Campbell (guitar, mandolin, fiddle), Teresa Williams (vocals), Jackie Greene (vocals and guitar), Steve Molitz (keyboards), and John Molo (drums), debuted in September 2007 in Santa Barbara, California.

On February 4, 2008, Phil and Friends joined Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir and drummer Mickey Hart, along with Barry Sless and RatDog guitarist Mark Karan, for a concert called &quot;Deadheads for Obama&quot;, in support of Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign. The show was the first time that Weir, Hart, and Lesh had played together since 2004. Even more recently, the band performed the final shows at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco. Bob Weir sat in for a run of five nights that included sets of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s first few albums.

In the fall of 2008, Phil Lesh and Friends toured the Eastern United States, including a run of 14 shows in 19 days, known as &quot;Philathon&quot;, at the Nokia Theatre Times Square in New York City. The final Phil Lesh and Friends performance until 2012 was on 12/31/08. Meanwhile, Phil had been touring with The Dead and Furthur.

=== 2012 ===
On Phil Lesh&#x27;s website, 3 dates at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado, were scheduled for the February 16, 17, and 18. A twelve-date appearance at Lesh&#x27;s new club, Terrapin Crossroads, is set to commence on March 17, 2012, which many old members of the band returning to appear alongside Lesh, as well as a few new members.

On April 26 through April 29 the original Quintet returned, performing four sold-out shows at Terrapin Crossroads.

The band also appeared at the 2012 Gathering of the Vibes and All Good Music Festival, featuring Phil Lesh, Jackie Greene, Grahame Lesh, Brian Lesh, Joe Russo, Larry Campbell, and Teresa Williams.

===2014===
In 2014, Phil Lesh signed an exclusive deal with concert promoter Peter Shapiro to perform 44 concerts across Shapiro&#x27;s venues. Thirty of those performances would take place at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York, with the others at the Brooklyn Bowls in New York, London and Las Vegas, as well as the Lockn&#x27; Festival in Arrington, Virginia.

Phil Lesh and Friends featuring Warren Haynes, Jackie Greene, John Medeski and Joe Russo performed two shows on April 14 and 15 at Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Phil and Friends then played two shows at Central Park&#x27;s Rumsey Playfield on May 28 and 31. The incarnation of this band included Warren Haynes, John Scofield, John Medeski and Joe Russo.

===2015–2016===
Starting in January 2015, Phil Lesh and Friends celebrated the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 50th Anniversary by performing tribute concerts, recreating select concerts from the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 30-year career, at his restaurant Terrapin Crossroads, along with select Grateful Dead Recreational Tribute shows at The Capitol Theatre, in Port Chester, New York. These celebrations of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 50th Anniversary continued into 2016.

In 2015, Phil Lesh And Friends had to cancel two shows at Terrapin Crossroads on October 24–25, due to the bladder cancer diagnosis of Phil Lesh.

At the 2015 Lockn&#x27; Festival, Carlos Santana made his debut as one of Phil&#x27;s &quot;Friends&quot;, sitting in for the whole set. The next night at Lock&#x27;n, The Chris Robinson Brotherhood also sat in with Phil Lesh &amp; Friends.

In celebration of Phil&#x27;s 76th birthday in 2015, Phil resurrected the classic &quot;Q&quot; lineup for a 2-night run at The Capitol Theatre, in Port Chester.

In January 2016, it was announced that Phil Lesh and Friends will perform a New Year&#x27;s Eve run in Hawaii, from December 29–31.

===2023-2024===
In March 2023, Phil Lesh performed his 100th show at The Capitol Theatre.

Lesh died on October 25, 2024. He was 84.

<doc id="377911" wikidata="Q1359893" url="?curid=377911" title="Tomáš Baťa">
<text>Tomáš Baťa () (3 April 1876 – 12 July 1932) was a Czech entrepreneur and founder of the Bata shoe company. His career was cut short when he died in a plane accident due to bad weather.

Baťa&#x27;s half-brother Jan Antonín Baťa took over his company, expanding it during the Great Depression. World War II resulted in much destruction of the business. After Communist governments were established in Czechoslovakia and other nations of Eastern Europe, they nationalized the Baťa enterprises, taking over the company group.

Tomáš&#x27;s son Thomas J. Bata rebuilt and expanded shoe manufacturing in the company name after moving to Canada in 1939, at the time of the Nazi invasion and annexation of Czechoslovakia.

==Career==
Tomáš Baťa established the organization in Zlín on 24 August 1894 with 800 Austrian gulden (equivalent to $320 at the time), inherited from his mother. His brother Antonín Baťa and sister Anna were partners in the startup firm T. &amp; A. Bata Shoe Company. Though this organization was newly established, the family had a long history of shoemaking, spanning eight generations and over three hundred years. This heritage helped boost the popularity of his new firm very quickly.

In 1904, Baťa travelled to Lynn, a city outside Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States that was then the center of world footwear production. He worked on an assembly line and learned about its machinery, such as Matzeliger&#x27;s automated laster. He began mechanizing his production upon his return and introduced an assembly line at Zlín in 1927. With modern production and long-distance retailing, Baťa modernized the shoemaking industry. From its start, the company developed rapidly in production and its profits rose.

Tomáš Baťa obtained sole control over the company in 1908 after his brother Antonín Baťa died from tuberculosis. Tomáš brought two of his younger brothers, Jan and Bohuš, into the business. World War I created a booming demand for military shoes, which the company started to produce. During the interwar period, Baťa again visited the United States, to observe progress at the River Rouge Plant of Henry Ford in Dearborn, Michigan. Upon his return, he directed his company to look towards decentralizing operations.

Baťa recognized the needs of his customers, whose purchasing power had been significantly reduced in the aftermath of the war, and enlarged his offerings to produce low-cost shoes for the general public. He also established factories and companies in other countries, including Poland, Yugoslavia, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom and, away from Europe: the United States and India. These factories were allowed to be self-sufficient and autonomous in their design, production and distribution strategies, in order to be able to cater to their local population. By the early 1930s, Bata had led the Baťa enterprise and Czechoslovakia to be the world&#x27;s leading footwear exporters.


Baťa was regarded as an advocate of Taylorism, functionalism and a proponent of many aspects of the Garden city movement.

Bata is credited with efforts to modernize his hometown, both through employment and construction of housing facilities, making him a very popular citizen. He was elected as mayor of Zlín. Baťa is widely regarded as a businessman with an acute sense of social consciousness. He is quoted by many as one of the first pioneers of employee welfare and social advancement programs. 
Tomáš Baťa stated:

&quot;Let&#x27;s bear in mind that the chances to multiply wealth are unlimited. All people can become rich. There is an error in our understandings - that all people cannot become equally rich. Wealth can not exist where the people are busy with mutual cheating, have no time for creating values and wealth. It is remarkable that we can find the greatest number of wealthy tradesmen and a population on a high standard of living in countries with a high level of business morality. On the other hand, we can find poor tradesmen and entrepreneurs and an impoverished population in countries with a low standard of business morality. This is natural because these people concentrate on cheating one another instead of trying to create value.&lt;br&gt;We are granting you the profit share not because we feel a need to give money to the people just out of the goodness of the heart. No, we are aiming at other goals by this step. By this measure we want to reach a further decrease of production costs. We want to reach the situation that the shoes are cheaper and workers earn even more. We think that our products are still too expensive and worker&#x27;s salary too low.&quot;

== Baťa&#x27;s leadership for quality and innovation ==

In a scholarly study of Tomáš Baťa as a leader and business innovator, Myron Tribus states:

&quot;When I first began this paper, I intended to demonstrate that what Baťa did is a superb illustration of what is now called &quot;quality management&quot;. The record shows that Tomáš Baťa did indeed precede modern &quot;quality management&quot; practices by at least half a century. If we look only at that side of the man, we must conclude that he was the first to use quality as a way to lower cost at the same time as he created customer delight.&quot;

&quot;However, as I delved more deeply into Baťa&#x27;s management methods, it became clear that looking at his work through such a lens gives much too narrow a focus. It is possible, of course, to analyze Baťa&#x27;s work as an example of what W. Edwards Deming has called his &quot;System of Profound Knowledge&quot;. However, the level of abstraction at which Dr. Deming describes this system makes it capable of encompassing many different activities and while it provides great generality, it does not provide a focus on what was unique about Baťa. I have chosen a less abstract approach, concentrating on the Baťa contributions I thought would be of greatest value in contemporary management. My objective is to find the most important lessons that the Baťa system of management can teach today&#x27;s entrepreneurs.&quot;

Wages scheme

Tomáš Baťa used 4 basic types of wages:

* Fixed rate - paid to a technical-operative and an administrative staff
* Individual order based rate - paid to some manufacture specialists
* Collective task rate - defined for manufacture labour
* Profit contribution rate - paid to operational managers

Also typical is so called &quot;Baťa price&quot;, establishing a price usually ending in the number nine. He found that psychologically, a price of 99 or 19.99 was apparently more appealing to customers than a rounded number, such as 100 or 20, even though the difference is just 1 currency unit.

Aviation

Baťa considered aviation another branch of commercial activity. His company was apparently the world&#x27;s first to use air transportation for travel of not only high-echelon staff, but also to send skilled workers quickly to places where their skills were critically needed. The emphasis was on timely deployment of manpower, not on the creation of prestige travel for a few chosen.

==Death and future of company==
Baťa died in a plane crash (Junkers J13 D1608) in 1932 near the Zlín airport while trying to fly to Möhlin in Switzerland on a business trip under bad weather conditions of dense local fog. 
After his death, his half-brother Jan Antonín Baťa took over ownership of the Bata companies. He greatly expanded the business into new fields, even during the Great Depression. He founded the famous Zlin aircraft works two years after Baťa&#x27;s death, starting with simple gliders. From the 1930s to the eve of the World War II, he developed for sale several sophisticated types (e.g. the Walter Mikron avgas-powered Zlín Z-XII, which was widely exported, and the Z-XIII, as well as some successful sailplanes) and aero engines. The Moravan-Zlin factory is the direct descendant of Jan Bata&#x27;s Czech aviation legacy.

In addition, Jan Antonín Baťa started new manufacturing and set up markets in numerous new countries. In 1939 after the Nazi invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia, he tried to negotiate to keep the company, before emigrating to the United States. In 1941 he resettled in Brazil, where he continued to act as an entrepreneur, creating several company towns. World War II resulted in much destruction of Bata businesses in Europe and Asia. After Communist governments were established in Central and Eastern Europe, they took over and nationalized the companies.

== Legacy ==
In 1934 his son Tomáš Baťa established an industrial manufacturing unit south of Kolkata, India. It was a complete industrial settlement and was named Batanagar. A Metro station in Delhi, Bata Chowk, is also named after him.

Anticipating the Second World War, Baťa&#x27;s son Thomas J. Bata, along with over 100 families from Czechoslovakia, moved to Canada in 1939. There he developed the Bata Shoe Company of Canada, founding the factory town of Batawa, Ontario.

During the Second World War, many Baťa businesses in Europe and the Far East that had been developed by Jan Baťa were destroyed. After the War, the core business enterprise in Czechoslovakia and other major enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe were nationalized by the Communist governments.

Thomas J. Bata devoted himself to the rebuilding and development of the Bata Shoe Organization, together with his wife and partner Sonja Bata. He successfully expanded into new markets throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Under his leadership, the Bata Shoe Organization had unprecedented growth. It became the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer and marketer of footwear selling over 300 million pairs of shoes each year and employing over 80,000 people.

== In fiction ==

*Musical revue, &quot;Ostrov Dynamit&quot;, 1930 (&quot;Dynamite Island&quot;) by Jiří Voskovec, Jan Werich, and the composer Jaroslav Ježek. This comedy satirized Tomáš Baťa as the villain Thomas Batha, who together with his Chinese servant Wu-Fang, exploit the natives of a tropical island in the South Pacific. The plot revolves around the magical powers of the island&#x27;s volcano, which every fifty years erupts, releasing a beneficial gas that lulls the people into calm and docility. Batha is the only one unaffected, as he uses a gas mask hidden in a forest (the exact location of which, however, he is unable to find).
*Novel, &quot;Obuv&#x27;,&quot; 1932 (&quot;Shoes&quot;), a part of &quot;Our day chronicles&quot; by Ilya Ehrenburg
*Novel, &quot;Botostroj&quot;, 1933 (&quot;The Shoe-Machine&quot;) by Svatopluk Turek. This communist writer portrayed Tomáš Baťa as a strong-willed dictator who sacrificed himself and all people around for success of the company. After its release, Jan Bata sued for defamation and tried to stop further publishing. In 1954, Turek&#x27;s novel was adapted as a movie of the same name, made by director K.M. Walló.
* Bata is featured as a character in Vikram Seth&#x27;s novel &quot;A Suitable Boy,&quot; but his firm is called the &quot;Praha&quot; (Prague) Shoe Company.

<text>Saint Eustace (Latinized Eustachius or Eustathius, Greek Εὐστάθιος Πλακίδας &quot;Eustathios Plakidas&quot;) is revered as a Christian martyr. According to legend, he was martyred in AD 118, at the command of emperor Hadrian. Eustace was a pagan Roman general, who converted to Christianity after he had a vision of the cross while hunting. He lost all his wealth, was separated from his wife and sons, and went into exile in Egypt. Called back to lead the Roman army by emperor Trajan, Eustace was happily reunited with his family and restored to high social standing, but after the death of Trajan, he and his family were martyred under Hadrian for refusing to sacrifice to pagan Roman gods.

Eustace was venerated in the Byzantine Church from at least the 7th century. 
His veneration is attested for the Latin Church for the 8th century, but his rise to popularity in Western Europe happened in the high medieval period, during the 12th to 13th centuries. There are many versions and adaptations of his legend, in prose, in verse, and in the form of plays, in Latin, French and other languages. The saint, and scenes from his legend, were also frequently depicted in the figurative arts.

His feast day, both in Eastern and Western tradition, is on 20 September. The Armenian Apostolic Church commemorates St. Eustace on 1 October.

== Legend ==
===Greek &quot;Vita&quot;===
The original tradition of the saint&#x27;s passion is Greek, the oldest surviving version (BHG 641) was composed at some point during the 5th to 7th centuries. Already in the Greek version, the later saint is a pagan general (στρατηλάτης &quot;stratēlátēs&quot;) under Trajan, called &quot;Plakidas&quot;. The Greek text also has all of the main elements found in the medieval Western accounts. Plakidas converted after he had a vision of a cross while hunting a stag and heard a divine voice prophesying his misfortune. Plakidas was baptized and took the name &quot;Eustathios&quot; (&quot;steadfast&quot;), his wife Tatiana took the baptismal name &quot;Theopiste&quot;. Their two sons were named &quot;Agapios&quot; and &quot;Theopistos&quot;.

Eustathios lost his estates and his wealth, and he and his family emigrated to Egypt. They could not pay for the passage, hence the ship&#x27;s captain demanded to keep Theopiste for himself. Eustathios escaped with his two sons by swimming. But later, when crossing a river, his sons were taken by wild animals. Eustathios believed them dead, but they were saved.

Years later, Trajan called Eustathios back to Rome to fight the barbarians, and Eustathios once again took the rank of general and raised an army. Among the soldiers were, unbeknownst to him, his two sons.
After defeating the barbarians, the general and his staff stayed in the house of an old woman. Agapios and Theopistos recognized each other. The old woman turned out to be their mother, Theopiste, who managed to escape from the ship&#x27;s captain before he could dishonour her. She recognized her husband, and the entire family was reunited.

When Trajan was succeeded by Hadrian, the new emperor asked his general to sacrifice to the gods, and when Eustathios refused, he threw him and his family to the lions, but the wild animals lay down at their feet. Therefore, Hadrian ordered them to be killed in a brazen bull.
The bodies of the martyrs were recovered in secrecy by Christians and buried in a &quot;well-known place&quot;.

=== French &quot;Vita&quot; ===
A &quot;Vita&quot; in French prose was composed around the middle of the 13th century.
In this version, the narrative begins with Placidus (Eustace&#x27;s name before he was baptized) out hunting. He follows a deer into some woods and becomes separated from the group of hunters; the deer turns towards him. Placidus is then awestruck by a vision where he sees the cross between the antlers of the deer, and in that moment, he is commanded by the voice of God to be baptized along with his family on that very night by the Bishop of Rome. He is baptized and has his name changed to Eustace, and then he receives another vision from a voice warning him of future trials for him and his family. They lose their goods, servants, livestock, and social status. They attempt to travel by boat, but cannot afford the voyage. Eustace and his two sons Agapius and Theopistus are then removed from the boat and separated from Eustace&#x27;s wife Theopista. They arrive at a river where Eustace has to carry them across one at a time. After successfully taking one to the other side, Eustace attempts to collect the other. However, both of his sons are taken by animals while he is crossing the river: one by a lion and the other by a wolf. Unknown to Eustace, his sons are saved and raised independently.

In the French tradition, Eustace then worked for fifteen years as a guard protecting fields until he was approached by two envoys of Roman emperor Trajan who were sent to persuade him to return to Rome and repel an uprising; Eustace complied. There in Rome, he was reinstated his original rank of general, led an army, and coincidentally, achieved victory in the home country of the captain who abducted his wife Theopista. Trading life stories after the battle, two soldiers discover they were the brothers abducted by animals, and overhearing them, Theopista recognizes her husband Eustace. Eustace and his family then return to Rome to celebrate at a victory dinner under the new Roman emperor Hadrian who was less tolerant towards Christians. Following the dinner, Hadrian requested Eustace and his family to make an offering to pagan gods; They refused. Eustace and his family were then thrown in a den of lions, but the lions did not touch them. Eustace and his family were then put into a brazen bull. They died, but their bodies were untouched by the flames.

===Variants and adaptations===
Numerous adaptations of the saint&#x27;s legend were composed, in verse and in prose, during the high medieval period, both in France and in Italy. There is &quot;rhythmic Life&quot; of 220 verses (BHL 2771) of the 9th or 10th century, and a 13th-century version of 2052 rhyming octosyllabic verses.
The legend was also adapted into at least ten different medieval plays in varying forms.

The legend up to St. Eustace&#x27;s martyrdom is a variant of the narrative type &quot;the Man Tried By Fate&quot;, which is also popular in chivalric romance in general. Except for an &quot;exemplum&quot; in &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;, all such tales are highly developed romances, such as &quot;Sir Isumbras&quot;. 
One of the medieval adaptations of the Eustace material as chivalric romance is the Spanish &quot;Book of the Knight Zifar&quot;.

==Historicity==
The historicity of Eustace cannot be substantiated, and he is widely seen as a &quot;fictitious saint&quot;, i.e. an adaptation in the form of hagiography of what was originally a didactic or entertaining fiction.
Hippolyte Delehaye (1919) did not believe in the saint&#x27;s historicity.
The Bollandist commentator (&quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot; vol. 46, p. 209) considers two possibilities: that of the saint being entirely fictitious, or that of an unknown early oriental martyr whose original cult has vanished without a trace.
The veneration of Eustace cannot be substantiated for times earlier than the 7th century, more than 501 years after his supposed martyrdom. The legend has little or no geographic detail, except for the &quot;flight to Egypt&quot;, paralleling that of the Holy Family. The village of &quot;Badioson&quot; (Βαδιοσών) where Eustace retires after the loss of his family is unknown, 
the river &quot;Hydaspes&quot; where Eustace fights his victorious battle with the &quot;barbarians&quot; alludes to Alexander the Great and bears no relation to any historical conflict fought by emperor Trajan (Trajan&#x27;s Parthian campaign resulted in an uneasy stalemate and was interrupted by Trajan&#x27;s death in 117); nor is Hadrian known to have actively persecuted Christians.
The origin of the Greek legend is most likely found in the Orient, likely Anatolia, perhaps Cappadocia,
where the stag has long been venerated in local cults.

The similarity of the stag hunting scene with certain tales of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; have been explained by Vielle (1990) as reflecting an underlying &quot;Celto-Galatian&quot; model.
A distant Indian origin for the element of the &quot;separated family&quot; has been proposed by Gaster (1893), specifically the Buddhist tale of &quot;Pacatara&quot; and &quot;Visvantara&quot; from the Pali canon (Dhammapada).

== Veneration ==
The veneration of Eustace originated in the Eastern Orthodox Church wherein he is venerated as &quot;Saint Eustathios the Great Martyr&quot; (). N. Thierry postulated that the tradition may have originated in Cappadocia, pointing out that a large repertoire of images of the Vision of Eustace exist as frescoes in this region&#x27;s early-Christian rock-cut churches. Thierry also notes a 7th-century Armeno-Georgian stele at the Davit Garedja monastery in present-day Georgia with a relief depicting the Vision of Eustace, and a relief on the chancel of Tsebelda in Abkhazia, dated variously from the 7th to the 9th century, that also depicts the Vision.

In the West, an early medieval church dedicated to him that existed in Rome is mentioned in a letter of Pope Gregory II (731–741).
His iconography may have passed to the 12th-century West, before which time European examples are scarce, in psalters, where the vision of Eustace, kneeling before a stag, illustrated Psalm 96, ii-12: &quot;Light is risen to the just...&quot;

An early European depiction of Eustace, the earliest one noted in the Duchy of Burgundy, is carved on a Romanesque capital at Vézelay Abbey. Abbot Suger mentions the first relics of Eustace in Europe, at an altar in the royal Basilica of St Denis; Philip Augustus of France rededicated the church of Saint Agnès, Paris, which became Saint-Eustache (rebuilt in the 16th–17th centuries). The story of Eustace was popularized in Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (c. 1260). Scenes from the story, especially of Eustace kneeling before the stag, then became popular subjects of medieval religious art: examples include a wall painting at Canterbury Cathedral and stained glass windows at the Cathedral of Chartres.

Eustace became known as a patron saint of hunters and firefighters, and also of anyone facing adversity; he was traditionally included among the Fourteen Holy Helpers. 
He is the patron of hunters especially in Bavaria and Austria, while in France, Belgium and Western Germany, it is more common to find Hubert of Liège in this role.
In the Anglican tradition, he has a (hunter&#x27;s) horn as his attribute. 
He also is one of the patron saints of Madrid, Spain.
Saint Eustace is honored in County Kildare, Ireland. There is a church dedicated to him on the campus of Newbridge College in Newbridge, County Kildare, and the schools&#x27; logo and motto is influenced by the vision of Saint Eustace. (However, the nearby village of Ballymore Eustace refers to the FitzEustace family.)

In Armenia, Erewmanavank (&quot;Convent of the Holy Apparition&quot;) near Egin was said to be built on the actual location of the encounter of Placidus with the deer. The earliest surviving text detailing this is a manuscript from 1446, but the monastery is far older than that and probably a Byzantine foundation; J.-M. Thierry considers it to be a 10th-century foundation, perhaps by Greeks from Cappadocia. Although the monastery was destroyed during the Armenian genocide, Thierry, in the 1980s, noted that a transmitted form of the legend still existed among local Muslim Kurds who talked of a &quot;deer of light&quot; appearing at the site.
In Georgian mythology, Saint Eustace became associated with the hunting deity Apsat, patron of game animals.

Saint Eustache&#x27;s feast day in the Roman Catholic Church, as is also in the Eastern Orthodox Church, is September 20, as indicated in the Roman Martyrology. The celebration of Saint Eustache and his companions was included in the Roman Calendar from the twelfth century until 1969, when it was removed because of the completely fabulous character of the saint&#x27;s &quot;Acta&quot;, resulting in a lack of sure knowledge about them. However, his feast is still observed by Roman Catholics who follow the pre-1970 Roman Calendar.
Saint Eustace&#x27;s commemoration was removed from the General Roman Calendar in 1970, though he continued to be commemorated in the latest edition of the Roman Martyrology. Local observance is still practiced.
Sant&#x27;Eustachio is also honoured in Tocco da Casauria, a town in the province of Pescara in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. The town&#x27;s church, built in the twelfth century, was dedicated to Saint Eustace. It was rebuilt after being partially destroyed by an earthquake in 1706.

The island of Sint Eustatius in the Caribbean Netherlands is named after him.
Also St Eustachius church is situated in Pakiapuram village, Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, India. Another church is situated in the name of St. Eustachius (St. Esthakiyar in Tamil) in Mittatharkulam, near valliyoor in Tirunelveli district.

<text>The Danites were a fraternal organization founded by Latter Day Saint members in June 1838, in the town of Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri. During their period of organization in Missouri, the Danites operated as a vigilante group and took a central role in the events of the 1838 Mormon War. They remained an important part of Mormon and non-Mormon folklore, polemics, and propaganda for the remainder of the 19th century, waning in ideological prominence after Utah gained statehood. Notwithstanding public excommunications of Danite leaders by the Church and both public and private statements from Joseph Smith referring to the band as being both evil in nature and a &quot;secret combination&quot; (a term used in the Book of Mormon to signify corruption within a group of people such as gangs, organized crime, and politics, as well as used in general parlance to signify unlawful conspiracy), the nature and scope of the organization and the degree to which it was officially connected to the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints) are not agreed between historians. Early in the group&#x27;s existence, Joseph Smith appeared to endorse its actions, but later turned against it as violence increased and the actions of the Danites inspired a hysteria in Missouri that eventually led to the Extermination Order. According to an essay on the website of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), &quot;Historians generally concur that Joseph Smith approved of the Danites but that he probably was not briefed on all their plans and likely did not sanction the full range of their activities.&quot;

In 1834, during the march of Zion&#x27;s Camp, a military expedition from Kirtland, Ohio, to Clay County, Missouri, Joseph Smith organized the first Mormon militia known as the &quot;Armies of Israel,&quot;, which pre-dated the Nauvoo Legion by eight years, to protect his community. Some historians have alleged this earlier militia to be the original formation of the Danite band. After the 1838 Missouri Mormon War, the term &quot;Danite&quot; was often connected with Latter Day Saint peacekeeping, including the Nauvoo, Illinois police, the bodyguards of Joseph Smith, and the &quot;whistling and whittling brigades&quot;. Although some members of these later groups had been Danites in the Missouri period, leadership of the 1838 secret society, which came to be known as &quot;Destroying Angels&quot; in particular under group founder Sampson Avard, was not associated with leadership of the peace-keeping militias commonly referred to by the same name.

==Background==
The Danites organized in the milieu of mutual hostility and conflict between the Mormon settlers and the more established Missourians, with numerous acts of violence perpetrated on both sides. They were active as a formal organization in Missouri in 1838. They began as a group of zealots determined to drive out internal dissention among the Mormonsdissenters which included former high ranking Mormons including the Three Witnessesbut progressed to becoming involved in militia and paramilitary conflicts with U.S. forces and both civilians and law enforcement of Missouri.

The Latter Day Saint movement had experienced periods of conflict and violence with neighboring communities. Prior to this period, Joseph Smith had promoted a non-violent policy, but this era of pacifism was coming to an end. In August 1833, Smith recorded a revelation that stated:

This revelation encouraged church members &quot;to bear it patiently and revile not&quot; when &quot;men will smite you, or your families&quot; yet also justified self-defense: If, after being endangered three times, &quot;he has sought thy life and thy life is endangered by him, thine enemy is in thy hands and thou art justified.&quot;

Prior to 1838, the Latter Day Saint movement had two centers—one in Kirtland, Ohio and the other in northwestern Missouri. The headquarters and First Presidency of the church were in Kirtland, while the Missouri church was led by a Stake Presidency made up of David Whitmer, W. W. Phelps, and John Whitmer. In 1836, John Whitmer and Phelps founded the town of Far West, Missouri, which became the headquarters of the church in Missouri. Throughout 1837, the church in Kirtland was experiencing internal conflicts over the failure of the church&#x27;s bank. Ultimately, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon of the First Presidency lost control of the headquarters, including the Kirtland Temple, to dissenters led by Warren Parish. Smith and his followers relocated to Far West, Missouri during the early part of 1838, beginning a period where Smith and other church leaders began to take the view that the church was fighting for its life.

In spring 1838, events came to a boiling point as the number of Mormons swelled in Missouri and Ohio and rifts within the church itself developed. Sudden heavy Mormon immigration, combined with their tendency to vote in a bloc, and their anti-slavery political and northern cultural views aroused hostility from the native Missourians. These tensions were escalated by the fact that Joseph Smith had been issuing prophecies that Missouri was meant to be the chosen place for Zion and the gathering of the Saints. Joseph Smith encouraged the Saints to be unafraid and referred to a passage in the 18th chapter of Judges about the tribe of Dan, &quot;If the enemy comes, the Danites will be after them, meaning the brethren in self-defense.&quot; One of those who heard Joseph speak of the Danites was Sampson Avard. Sampson Avard secretly organized some of the brethren into companies for mutual defense and protection. He said he had the sanction of the First Presidency. He also taught those who would follow him that they should lead their companies against the gentiles, to rob and plunder them, and waste them away. With the loot, the kingdom of God would be built. The majority of Avard&#x27;s followers left him in disgust, and soon Avard was excommunicated.

On the fourth of July in 1838, Mormon leader Sidney Rigdon delivered an oration in Far West, the county seat of Caldwell County. While not wishing or intending to start any trouble with his non-Mormon neighbors, Rigdon wanted to make clear that the Mormons would meet any further attacks on them—-such as had occurred in Jackson County during the summer and fall of 1833—with force. This however encouraged the Danites to offer resistance to the mobs that had driven them out of their homes in Jackson County. Latter Day Saints claims to rights to Missouri were countered back and forth with hostile rhetoric from non-Mormon news sources and politicians. Eventually the situation became dire, with one government agent writing:

The citizens of Daviess, Carroll, and some other normal counties have raised mob after mob for the last two months for the purpose of driving the Mormons from those counties and from the State. These things have at length goaded the Mormons into a state of desperation that has now made some members to become the aggressors instead of acting on the defensive.

== Formation ==

In June 1838, a group of Mormons began meeting together in Far West under the leadership of Sampson Avard, Jared Carter, and George W. Robinson to discuss the problem of Mormon dissenters. The group organized under the name &quot;The Daughters of Zion.&quot; A second group was formed in nearby Adam-ondi-Ahman where stake president and special counselor in the First Presidency John Smith recorded the name Danites in his diary and characterized the meetings as routine events. The name &quot;Danites&quot; probably refers to a Biblical prophecy found in the Book of Daniel (). According to Albert P. Rockwood, a loyal Mormon writing in October 1838:
Thomas B. Marsh, former President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, left the church, citing improper handling of the church&#x27;s finances by its leadership. He began writing and speaking critically of the church, which resulted in his formal excommunication. He left after hearing reports of the destruction of non-Mormon settlements, including Gallatin, by the Mormons. He was present at early Danite meetings and said that the Danites swore oaths &quot;to support the heads of the church in all things that they say or do, whether right or wrong.&quot; The newly formed Danites disagreed initially on what steps to take against the dissenters, who had left the church but still lived nearby on land that had murky legal status. The properties had been purchased with a mixture of common and private funds, and in the name of both the LDS Church and private individuals. Reed Peck, another ex-Mormon, alleged that Carter and Dimick B. Huntington proposed that the group &quot;kill these men that they would not be capable of injuring the church.&quot; Marsh (while still a practicing Mormon) and John Corrill successfully argued against the proposal.

===&quot;Salt Sermon&quot;===

John Corrill recalled that &quot;the first presidency did not seem to have much to do with [the Danites] at first&quot;, and some of the Danites clearly saw this sermon as a sign of approval. The matter was tabled until the following Sunday (June 17, 1838) when Sidney Rigdon preached his Salt Sermon, in which he likened the dissenters to &quot;salt that had lost its savor.&quot; He went on to state that the dissenters would be &quot;trodden under the foot of men.&quot; Corrill stated that &quot;although [Rigdon] did not give names in his sermon, yet it was plainly understood that he meant the dissenters or those who had denied the faith.&quot; Rigdon&#x27;s strongly worded sermon may have played a significant role in encouraging the dissenters to leave the county.

===Danite Manifesto===

Ebenezer Robinson (who remained with the church after 1838), recalled that the next day a letter was &quot;gotten up in the office of the First Presidency,&quot; which Danite leader Sampson Avard later charged was written by Sidney Rigdon. The letter was addressed specifically to the principal dissenters: Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, John Whitmer, William Wines Phelps, and Lyman E. Johnson. The letter demanded the dissenters depart the county, writing:
for out of the county you shall go, and no power shall save you. And you shall have three days after you receive this communication to you, including twenty-four hours in each day, for you to depart with your families peaceably; which you may do undisturbed by any person; but in that time, if you do not depart, we will use the means in our power to cause you to depart; for go you shall.

It made several accusations concerning the actions and character of these dissenters and then stated:

We have solemnly warned you, and that in the most determined manner, that if you do not cease that course of wanton abuse of the citizens of this county, that vengeance would overtake you sooner or later, and that when it did come it would be as furious as the mountain torrent, and as terrible as the beating tempest; but you have affected to despise our warnings, and pass them off with a sneer, or a grin, or a threat, and pursued your former course; and vengeance sleepeth not, neither does it slumber; and unless you heed us this time, and attend to our request, it will overtake you at an hour when you do not expect, and at a day when you do not look for it; and for you there shall be no escape; for there is but one decree for you, which is depart, depart, or a more fatal calamity shall befall you.

The letter — later known as the &quot;Danite Manifesto&quot; — displayed the signatures of eighty-three Mormons, including that of Joseph Smith&#x27;s brother, and fellow member of the First Presidency, Hyrum, but not Joseph or Rigdon. Robinson later said that all of the signers were Danites.

The letter had the desired effect and the few named dissenters quickly fled the county, relocating to Liberty and Richmond in neighboring Clay and Ray counties. Despite the harsh treatment of the few vocal dissidents, a dozen others were permitted to peacefully remain in the community. One of the expelled dissenters, John Whitmer, said that they had been &quot;driven from their homes&quot; and robbed &quot;of all their goods save clothing &amp; bedding &amp;c.&quot; Reed Peck agreed, asserting that &quot;the claims by which this property was taken from these men were unjust and perhaps without foundation cannot be doubted by any unprejudiced person acquainted with all parties and circumstances.&quot;

== Expanding role ==

The Danites&#x27; role shifted from internal enforcement to external defense when the non-Mormon Missourian majority asked the Mormons to leave, at first making a request without threat of force. In coming months, hostilities between Mormons and Missourians would grow to the point that the Missouri State Militia drove most of the Mormons out of Missouri. Governor Lilburn Boggs issued Missouri Executive Order 44 on October 27, 1838, which expelled the Mormons from Missouri.

However, conflict developed between Smith and the Danites&#x27; leader, Sampson Avard. In Smith&#x27;s account, Avard, while a new member to the Church, formed a &quot;secret combination&quot;, an allusion to a nefarious society as discussed in the Book of Mormon. Smith further stated that Avard&#x27;s pride and zeal prompted him to organize the group contrary to the will of Smith and the other leaders of the Church. According to this view, Avard illegitimately claimed to be the Lord&#x27;s agent, and according to a quote Smith attributed to Avard, he wanted to profit from vigilantism by taking &quot;spoils of the goods of ungodly Gentiles [non-Mormons].&quot;

Joseph Smith soon took action against Avard in the name of the church, removing him from all military duties and establishing him as a surgeon to help with the wounded; Avard mentions this demotion himself. Avard was eventually excommunicated. Smith&#x27;s &quot;History of the Church&quot; states: &quot;When a knowledge of Avard&#x27;s rascality came to the Presidency of the Church, he was cut off from the Church, and every means proper used to destroy his influence, at which he was highly incensed and went about whispering his evil insinuations, but finding every effort unavailing, he again turned conspirator, and sought to make friends with the mob.&quot;

With the opposition leaders ousted and the hostilities increasing, the Danite group took on three additional primary functions, (1) enforcement of the Law of Consecration, (2) political activities, and (3) militia activities.

===Enforcers===
The law of consecration was a commandment given to the church to establish a kind of communitarian program whereby the saints were to give or &quot;consecrate all their money and property to the Church&quot; and lease it back, so that the church could purchase lands for settlement by the destitute converts continually pouring into northwestern Missouri. Corrill recalled that &quot;shortly after the Danites became organized, they set out to enforce the Law of Consecration, but this did not amount to much&quot;.

===Political activities===
In the realm of politics, the Danites were called upon to distribute tickets containing the names of candidates approved by the Presidency for the election which was held on August 6. Church leader John Corrill was the approved candidate and consequently won election to the Missouri House of Representatives, but he conceded, &quot;Many saw that it was taking unfair advantage of the election and were extremely dissatisfied&quot;. Except for 15 or 20 votes, the election was nearly unanimous.

A second outpost of Danites had been organized in Daviess County under the leadership of Lyman Wight, who was also a colonel in the state militia. The Danites in Daviess County took part in the Gallatin Election Day Battle, when a group of non-Mormons attempted to prevent any Mormons from voting.

== Militia ==

Danite activity eventually progressed from political action to military action. On July 4, 1838, the Latter Day Saints in Far West held a large Independence Day celebration. As part of the celebration, a military review was held in which both the Mormons of the legal Caldwell County militia (led by Colonel George M. Hinkle), and the Danites (led by Jared Carter, Sampson Avard and Cornelius P. Lott) paraded. The keynote address came from church spokesman, Sidney Rigdon, who gave an oration, sometimes referred to as the Mormons&#x27; &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; from the &quot;persecution of mobs.&quot; In it, Rigdon announced:
And that mob that comes on us to disturb us, it shall be between us and them a war of extermination; for we will follow them until the last drop of their blood is spilled; or else they will have to exterminate us, for we will carry the seat of war to their own houses and their own families, and one party or the other shall be utterly destroyed...&quot; 
Although the First Presidency was generally pleased with the speech and had copies printed and distributed, Brigham Young later recalled that it was &quot;the prime cause of our troubles in Missouri.

===Daviess Expedition===

The new policy of an &quot;aggressive defense against mobs&quot; was put into practice in Daviess County when a group of non-Mormon vigilantes, primarily from Clinton and Platte counties, began to harass Mormons in outlying areas. The vigilantes hoped to drive the Mormons from the county through a policy of intimidation, the burning of isolated homes, and the plundering of property. Seeing the mob violence as a repeat of the nightmares they went through in Independence, Missouri a half-dozen years earlier, the Latter Day Saints requested assistance from state authorities, with little success. On October 18, Joseph Smith called for the assistance of all men who could participate; elements of the Caldwell militia, as well as some of the Danites and their secret oaths of vengeance, gathered at Adam-ondi-Ahman, the Saints&#x27; headquarters in Daviess County. From there, Apostle David W. Patten led raiding parties against the settlements of Gallatin, Millport, and Grindstone Forks. The cannon with which the mob had promised to attack Far West was found buried in the ground, and the towns were basically deserted; remaining non-Mormons were expelled, and some stores and homes were burned. Additionally, the property left by the fleeing mobs was &quot;consecrated&quot; by the raiding parties and brought back to the bishop&#x27;s storehouse in Adam-ondi-Ahman. These actions caused Apostles Thomas B. Marsh and Orson Hyde to dissent after this incident. They traveled to Richmond and swore out an affidavit concerning the existence of the Danites, and of a &quot;destroying company&quot; that had been set up with instructions to burn Richmond and Liberty.

===Battle of Crooked River===
1838 saw an escalation in tensions between the members of the Latter Day Saint church and their neighbors in northwestern Missouri. Ray County was located immediately south of the Mormon Caldwell County. The two counties were separated by a so called &#x27;no man&#x27;s land&#x27; measuring six miles by one mile, known as &quot;Bunkham&#x27;s Strip&quot; or &quot;Buncombe Strip.&quot; This unincorporated strip was attached to Ray County for administrative and military purposes. The citizens of Ray County and their neighbors to the west in Clay County, first began to have concerns about the Mormons to the north when a group of &quot;dissenters&quot; from the church were expelled from Caldwell County. These dissenters, including David Whitmer, W.W. Phelps, John Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery had been the leaders of the Latter Day Saint church in Missouri. They relocated their families to Richmond and Liberty, the county seats of Ray and Clay, respectively, and said that their lives had been threatened and their property had been stolen by the Mormons.

Conflicts between the Mormons and non-Mormons in Carroll County and Daviess County throughout the summer put settlers in the more settled counties of Ray and Clay increasingly on edge. This unease reached a bursting point when further dissenters, Thomas B. Marsh and Orson Hyde of the Mormon Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, arrived in Richmond and reported that the Mormons had invaded Daviess County and sacked the county seat of Gallatin. They also charged that a Mormon group known as the Danites planned to burn Richmond and Liberty to the ground. This testimony sent the worried citizens into a near frenzy. Women, children and property were ferried across the Missouri River for protection against an imminent Mormon invasion, and the state militia was put on alert.

====Lead-up to the battle====
General David Rice Atchison, of Clay County, commander of the state militia in northwestern Missouri ordered a company led by Captain Samuel Bogart of Clay County to patrol Bunkham&#x27;s strip to &quot;prevent, if possible, any invasion of Ray county by persons in arms whatever&quot;. Bogart was not necessarily the best man for the job. According to Peter Burnett, a resident of Liberty, &quot;Captain Bogart was not a very discreet man, and his men were of much the same character.&quot; Bogart had previously participated in a vigilante group that harried the Mormons in Carroll County.

Bogart quickly exceeded his orders. He and his men began visiting the homes of Latter Day Saints living in Bunkham&#x27;s Strip, forcibly disarming them and ordering them to leave Ray County. Bogart then apparently penetrated into Caldwell County and began to similarly harass Mormons there, advising them to remove to Far West, the county seat. Returning to Ray County, his men captured three Mormons — Nathan Pinkham, Jr., William Seely, and Addison Green — who may have been acting as scouts against a potential invasion from Ray County.

Exaggerated reports quickly made it to Far West to the effect that a &quot;mob&quot; had captured and intended to execute a group of Mormon prisoners. The Mormons immediately assembled an armed rescue party. Although Colonel George M. Hinkle, head of the official Caldwell County militia was available, Joseph Smith placed Apostle David W. Patten in charge of the force. Patten, who had come to be known as &quot;Captain Fear-not&quot;, for his part in the attacks in Daviess County, was apparently a leader in the Danite organization, and the choice of him over Hinkle may indicate the rescue was planned as an unofficial excursion. The Mormon force quickly moved south along the main road connecting Far West and Richmond.

====The battle====
On the night of October 24, 1838, Captain Bogart&#x27;s unit had camped along the banks of Crooked River in Bunkham&#x27;s Strip. Patten and the Mormon rescue company approached from the north along the main road. At daybreak on the 25th, the Mormons encountered the militia&#x27;s sentries. A brief firefight ensued with each side testifying that the other had fired first. One of the sentries, John Lockhart, shot Patrick Obanion, the Mormons&#x27; scout. Obanion later died from this wound. Lockhart and the other guards then fled down the hill to the militia camp which took up a defensive position.

The Mormon company approached the camp of the Ray militia and formed a battle line in three columns, led by David W. Patten, Charles C. Rich, and Patrick Durfee. Rich later recalled that soon after the Mormons had formed their lines, the militia &quot;fired upon us with all their guns.&quot; A general firefight commenced, but the militia were situated behind the riverbank and held the strategically superior position. Patten decided to charge the militia position, shouting the Mormon battle cry of &quot;God and Liberty!&quot; The Missourians were without swords and so broke their lines and fled across the river in all directions. During the retreat, the Mormons continued to fire and one of the militiamen, Moses Rowland, was killed.

During his charge, however, Patten was shot and mortally wounded. Ebenezer Robinson recalled that Patten had been &quot;brave to a fault, so much so that he was styled and called &#x27;Captain Fearnought&#x27;.&quot; Although it was not immediately realized, Gideon Carter had also been killed, making three Mormon fatalities and one militiaman fatality. The Mormons collected their wounded as well as the baggage Bogart&#x27;s unit had left in the camp and made their way back to Far West.

===Aftermath===

Although the battle resulted in only four fatalities, the effect was a massive escalation of the Missouri Mormon War. Exaggerated reports (some saying that half of Bogart&#x27;s men had been lost) made their way to Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs who responded by issuing Missouri Executive Order 44, known as the &quot;Extermination Order,&quot; which stated that &quot;[t]he Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state.&quot; Boggs called out 2,500 state militiamen to put down what he perceived to be open rebellion by the Mormons. In the end, the leaders of the church were captured and the bulk of the membership were forced to leave the state.

Thousands of Latter Day Saints had flowed into Missouri in just a few years; they were against slavery and voted as a bloc. This led to the unease and the mob action against the Saints; Sidney Rigdon fueled the fire with his July 4 speech. The Missouri state officials considered the Mormons to be the aggressors in the war, and after the destitute saints were forced to flee to Illinois, their homes in Far West and Adam-ondi-Ahman were occupied by the mob. A large number of church leaders, including Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, Parley P. Pratt, and George W. Robinson were charged with many crimes including treason. It was during a preliminary hearing that Smith and the other defendants learned that Danite leader Sampson Avard had testified against them. As a result of the testimony, Judge Austin A. King of the Fifth Circuit of Missouri ruled that there was sufficient evidence to hold Smith, Rigdon and other leaders for trial; nevertheless, they waited for over six months in Liberty Jail for their trial. Despairing of ever being allowed to come to trial, Smith and the others escaped from the prison, and soon made their way to join the Latter Day Saints in Quincy, Illinois.

==Number of Danites==
The two primary and opposing views concerning the extent of the Danite organization are represented by authors D. Michael Quinn and Alexander L. Baugh.

The Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship at Brigham Young University has highly criticized the first position posited by researcher Quinn for its reliance on arguably unreliable sources. Quinn follows the affidavit of self-professed Danite John N. Sapp, who stated on September 4, 1838, that the number of Danites was &quot;betwixt eight and ten hundred men, well armed and equipped...&quot; He also credits the testimony of another Danite, Anson Call, who said that &quot;the whole of the Military Force&quot; at Far West belonged to the Danite organization. Based on these and other statements, Quinn concludes that nearly the entire fighting force of some 900 Mormon men in Caldwell and Daviess counties had become Danites, and that by end of summer 1838, to be a member in full standing a Mormon must also have been a Danite.
In a second position, Baugh disagrees and argues with Quinn that the Danites were always &quot;a select group.&quot; He finds the testimony of John Corrill, who gave the total number of Danites at 300, more reliable than that of Sapp or Call.

==Joseph Smith&#x27;s involvement==

According to an essay on the website of the LDS Church, &quot;Historians generally concur that Joseph Smith approved of the Danites but that he probably was not briefed on all their plans and likely did not sanction the full range of their activities.&quot; Establishing the true leadership of an organization that self-identifies as secret and unofficial is problematic and has made establishing an accurate history surrounding the Danites difficult. While there are some primary accounts of the Danites and their activities, scholars of LDS church history largely hold that these sources are partisan (and quite often contradictory), with nearly all reports coming from disaffected Mormons such as Sampson Avard (ex-Mormon and former Danite with a well-documented vendetta against Smith and the church), John D. Lee (ex-Mormon who publicly said he had been scapegoated by the church), Fanny Stenhouse (an ex-Mormon who co-authored with her husband a series of exposés on Mormonism), and Ann Eliza Young (the ex-wife of Brigham Young and vocal opponent of the church). Certainly, the existence of the Danite band during the conflict known as the 1838 Mormon War is well established.

Joseph Smith never identified himself as a Danite. However, in 1834, Smith was elected as commander-in-chief of the Armies of Israel by the Kirtland high council. Though the Danite band self-identified as unofficial, there is confusion and controversy surrounding the independence of the Danite organization since its constitution states, &quot;All officers shall be subject to the commands of the Captain General, given through the Secretary of War&quot;. Smith had the title of Secretary of War during the three years prior to the year in which it is widely believed the Danites were first organized. However, Smith did not attest to any affiliation with the Danite band, and none of the close contemporaries of Smith alleged otherwise.

In fact, despite likely originally approving of the Danites, Smith wrote of the actions of the Danites largely with disapproval and on more than one occasion. However, in speaking on dissenting Mormons, Smith wrote in his Scriptory Book that after Sidney Rigdon spoke on the subject of &quot;dissenters,&quot; they (according to Smith) &quot;took warning, and Soon they were Seen bounding over the prairie like the Scape Goat to carry of[f] their own Sins we have not Seen them Since, their influence is gone, and they are in a miserable condition. So also it with all who turn from the truth to Lying Cheating defrauding &amp; Swindeling.&quot; It has been alleged by some historians that these comments evidenced Smith&#x27;s approval of the Danites&#x27; actions.

Further, LDS Church leader Sidney Rigdon expressed disapproval of Danites, although he asserted his belief that the Mormons were within their rights to forcibly expel dissenters from their midst, saying that: &quot;When a country, or body of people have individuals among them with whom they do not wish to associate and a public expression is taken against their remaining among them and such individuals do not remove it is the principle of republicanism itself that gives that community a right to expel them forcibly and no law will prevent it.&quot; Again, like the statements made by Smith, that such statements made by Rigdon could be said to be made in reference to the Danites is only suggestive.

There is one statement made by Joseph Smith which endorsed the Danite band, apparently near its inception. In his journal, Smith wrote: &quot;Thus far, according to the order of the Danites. We have a company of Danites in these times, to put to right physically that which is not right, and to cleanse the Church of every great evil which has hitherto existed among us inasmuch as they cannot be put to right by teachings and persuasyons. This company or a part of them exhibited on the fourth day of July [—] They come up to consecrate, by companies of tens, commanded by their captains over ten.&quot;

Nonetheless, over time, as the prominence and violence of the group grew, Smith condemned the group, referring to them as &quot;evil&quot; in nature and a &quot;secret combination&quot; (a negative term in LDS Church usage). Since these condemnations largely appeared after Smith and the Church had been charged with treason in fall of 1838, and after Smith and the Church leaders became concerned with the actions of alleged rogue groups and their potential negative effect on the Mormon community at large, it is unclear whether they reflected philosophical or political positions of the moment.

Smith and the Church leaders eventually were forced to publicly excommunicate the Danite leader, Sampson Avard.

===Hyrum Smith===

Hyrum Smith, brother of Joseph Smith, was a member of the First Presidency of the church at the time that his signature appeared on the document known as the &quot;Danite Manifesto.&quot; There has been dispute about if he in fact signed the document, or if instead others used his name because of his prominent position in the church.

===Sampson Avard===

Sampson Avard became the lead witness for the prosecution in a trial of Joseph Smith and other church leaders. As Avard was well known as the leader of the Danites, his role as a witness was a surprise to both the church and Missourians. Avard testified that he considered &quot;Joseph Smith, as the prime mover and organizer of the Danite band.&quot;

Avard went on to implicate Smith as the overall commander of the Daviess Expedition and other Danite vigilante activities. He included a recitation of a Danite Constitution with eight articles, specifying that the &quot;executive power&quot; of the Danite society would be &quot;vested in the president of the whole church.&quot; However, Moses Clawson, John Corrill, Reed Peck, and others (all well-known Danites) all named Avard as the head of the organization and not Smith. George M. Hinkle testified under oath that Joseph and Hyrum Smith never commanded any Danites in the field. Statements from known associates of Avard, including Ebenezer Robinson, Morris Phelps, and John D. Lee, place Smith in a more commanding role. Several scholars have pointed to evidence which suggests that, to avoid prosecution, Avard may have promised prosecutors that he and his associates (i.e., Robinson, Phelps, and Lee) would implicate Smith in the Danite organization.

While it is clear that Smith was aware of the existence of the Danites and, at least initially, approved of certain Danite activities, Smith&#x27;s role in the creation of the Danites and especially his involvement in its later activities (particularly actions of escalating violence) remain unclear. After Avard&#x27;s excommunication and disaffection from the Latter Day Saint community, Smith continued to publicly condemn both Avard individually and the Danite organization as a whole. No known documents show that the Danite band operated at any time during its history under official Latter Day Saint sanction, nor that the Danite band existed after Avard&#x27;s excommunication and after 1838.

== Allegations in Utah ==

Historian Leland Gentry asserts that after Sampson Avard was captured in November 1838, the Danite movement &quot;died a quick death.&quot; Gentry cites numerous evidences supporting this position in his book, &quot;The Danite Band of 1838.&quot; Nevertheless, after the Mormons settled in Nauvoo, Illinois and later in Utah, they were dogged by rumors the Danites continued to exercise influence within the Mormon community.

These beliefs were fueled by the fact that many former Danites occupied prominent paramilitary or law enforcement roles in the new settlements. For example, alleged former Danite Hosea Stout became the chief of police in Nauvoo. Then, after Joseph Smith was assassinated in 1844, Brigham Young made Stout head of the &quot;Whistling and Whittling Brigade&quot; – a group of young boys who intimidated strangers by following them around Nauvoo &quot;whistling&quot; until they left. Another reported former Danite, Orrin Porter Rockwell, became a body guard to Joseph Smith in Nauvoo, and later to Brigham Young. Disaffected and dissenting ex-Mormon, Ann Eliza Young, stated that Rockwell gained fame as one of Young&#x27;s &quot;Destroying Angels&quot;.

Despite the presence of purported former Danites within the LDS Church, there is no evidence they continued to exist as an organized body after 1838, or that they participated in any actions against dissenting and former Mormons in Utah. For instance, while former Danite John D. Lee&#x27;s lengthy confessional describes the operations of the Danites in Missouri, he makes no indication to the continued existence of the organization after the Mormons left the state.

When the expedition of Lt. John W. Gunnison was killed by Indians in 1853, some said that the Danites had a hand in the affair. However, these claims were refuted by an official investigation led by Gunnison&#x27;s second in command. Similar reports circulated when Indians killed territorial official Almon W. Babbitt on the plains in 1856, though there is no evidence supporting this allegation.

In the 1870s, Ann Eliza Young and Fanny Stenhouse (both former Mormons) authored exposés of Mormonism. Young and Stenhouse stated that the Danites were active, and primarily occupied with the task of discreetly murdering and disposing of Mormon dissenters and outsiders perceived to be a threat to Brigham Young&#x27;s power.

=== Brigham Young ===

Brigham Young denied that the Danites continued to exist. However, on July 5, 1857, just before the start of the Utah War, Young used language similar to the fiery sermons that preceded the 1838 Mormon War. In the address Young demanded military action against former Mormon persecutors, mobocrats, and the &quot;priests, editors, and politicians&quot; who were then denouncing the Mormons. Young declared that if these provocateurs came to the Utah Territory, the Mormons would &quot;deal&quot; with them. He stated that anyone who entered the territory and didn&#x27;t &quot;behave themselves,&quot; including any Mormon who &quot;unlawfully disturbs anyone,&quot; would &quot;find a &#x27;Vigilance Committee.&#x27;&quot; This was most likely a reference to the famous San Francisco Vigilance Committee of 1856, an organization that one writer called &quot;the largest and most influential vigilante group in American history.&quot; Young also declared that any such men would find &quot;not only the Danites, whom they talk so much about, biting the horses (sic) heels, but the scoundrels will find something biting &#x27;their&#x27; heels.&quot;

Otherwise, Young persistently denied the existence of Danitism in Utah. For instance, in June 1857, he said in a public address: &quot;[people claim that the Danites] are in every town and city throughout the whole of the United States, and that their object is not known by the people. That they are all over the world; that there are thousands of them, and that the life of every officer that comes here is in the hands of the Danites. That even the President of the United States is not safe, for at one wink from Brigham the Danites will be upon him and kill him...It is all a pack of nonsense, the whole of it.&quot;

Later, in September 1857, Young said in a private meeting of the church leadership,: &quot;the world accuse !(sic) me of controlling the affairs of Calafornia (sic) &amp; kansas (sic) &amp;c. The people do believe that we have a Band Called the Danites but how Could they exist so long without shedding Blood? For we Cannot find that they have killed any body. But I do not know of any such men.&quot;

A decade later, Brigham Young again denied the existence of violence by Danites. On April 7, 1867, he stated:
Is there war in our religion? No; neither war nor bloodshed. Yet our enemies cry out &quot;bloodshed&quot;, and &quot;oh, what dreadful men these Mormons are, and those Danites! how they slay and kill!&quot; Such is all nonsense and folly in the extreme. The wicked slay the wicked, and they will lay it on the Saints.
Historian Leonard Arrington attributes the stories of Danites in Utah to overzealous descriptions of the &quot;Minute Men,&quot; a law enforcement organization created by Brigham Young to pursue marauding Indians and white criminals. Arthur Conan Doyle and other authors had also popularized the idea of blood-thirsty Danites riding rough-shod through Utah in various fictional works. At the same time, there is evidence that, purportedly in order to deter and punish crime in Utah Territory, Brigham Young occasionally authorized local church leaders to engage in vigilante actions on an ad hoc basis. For instance, in early 1857, Young ordered local authorities to monitor two recently released convicts who were on the trail to California. If they were caught stealing livestock along the way, he authorized their summary execution. Historian Ardis Parshall believes that this led to an attack on an unrelated party which wounded several individuals in a case of mistaken identity. Indeed, in the same sermon where he spoke of the Danites and Vigilance Committees in 1857, Young also stated: &quot;There have been men here who have had their plans to arrange for robbing; and I will take the liberty to say that, when we find them, &#x27;judgement will be laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet.&#x27; Those are my feelings, and I express them plainly, that the good and honest may be able to pass from the Eastern States to California, and back and forth, in &quot; peace...&quot;I want the people in the States to know that there are a few poor curses here, and to know that we do not want gangs of highwaymen here. And I say to such characters...we will send you home quick, whenever we can catch and convict you.&quot;

These vigilante actions may have also been a source for the continued Danite myth.

==Depictions in popular culture==

Beginning in the 19th century, a number of authors, including the notable British fiction writers Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Louis Stevenson, make references to &quot;Danites&quot; as a shadowy, secret group who terrorized the early LDS Church settlements in Utah. These references usually appear in popular fiction or works critical of the LDS Church, and rumors of Danites practicing some form of blood atonement often play a significant role in these accounts. The group has also been depicted on screen.

Washington Bailey, in his memoir, &quot;A Trip To California In 1853&quot;, reported local rumor that Brigham Young&#x27;s &quot;Destroying Angels&quot; were conducting raids on wagon trains near Salt Lake City and blaming it on Indians. However he was not an eyewitness to these events.

Lavinia Honeyman Porter, in her memoir &quot;By Ox Team to California: A Narrative of Crossing the Plains in 1860&quot; also reported rumors of raiding Mormons near Salt Lake City, but did not mention the raiding group by name, and herself passed safely through Salt Lake City and conducted trade and social visits with Mormons.

Danites feature prominently in &quot;Story of the Destroying Angel&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson and Fanny Stevenson, part of the collection &quot;The Dynamiter&quot;. Danites are represented as a world-wide secret organization of spies and assassins, dedicated to enforcing the edicts of Brigham Young. They are described as the force that makes Utah a &quot;strong prison [...] who can escape the watch of that unsleeping eye of Utah?&quot; They are described as bloodthirsty murderers, planning the &quot;massacre of sixty German immigrants&quot; and with the ability of making dissenters disappear without a trace.

A particularly well-known example is Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s fictionalization of the Danites in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, the first Sherlock Holmes novel, published in 1887. In the story, the Danites constitute a brutal group of enforcing vigilantes operating under the direction of Brigham Young—and more particularly the fictional &quot;Sacred Council of Four,&quot; silencing criticism and questioning, and preventing dissenters from leaving the Salt Lake Valley. Doyle&#x27;s embellishment of the folklore surrounding the original Missouri band transplanted to a romantic wild west setting, the established criminal notoriety of Rockwell, and rumors of Young&#x27;s &quot;Avenging Angels&quot; made acceptance of the &quot;authoritative&quot; Sherlock story a simple matter for English readers. However, after a visit to Utah in 1923, Doyle is reported to have said &quot;...he had been misled by writings of the time about the church.&quot; In 1991, Doyle&#x27;s daughter stated that &quot;Father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons.&quot;

&quot;The Avenging Angel&quot; (1995) is a film featuring Brigham Young, Porter Rockwell, and Wild Bill Hickman that centers on the fictional character and his activities as a Danite.

Sally Denton, in her 2003 history of the 1857 Mountain Meadows massacre, &quot;American Massacre&quot;, claims that the Danites and blood atonement had a prominent role in 19th century Utah society. Denton attributes the creation of the Danites to Joseph Smith as his &quot;secret group of loyalists&quot; and suggests that they became &quot;one of the most legendarily feared bands in frontier America.&quot; According to Denton, this &quot;consecrated, clandestine unit of divinely inspired assassins&quot; introduced &quot;the ritualized form of murder called blood atonement--providing the victim with eternal salvation by slitting his throat.&quot; Denton said that &quot;blood atonement&quot; was one of the doctrines which Mormons held &quot;most sacred&quot; and that &quot;[t]hose who dared to flee Zion were hunted down and killed.&quot; Denton implies that large numbers of such &quot;atonements&quot; occurred during the Mormon reformation of 1856, although &quot;none of the crimes were ever reported in the Deseret News&quot;, and that the &quot;bloody regime…ended with [Jedediah] Grant&#x27;s sudden death, on December 1, 1856.&quot;

A major plot sequence of L. E. Modesitt Jr.&#x27;s 2009 science fiction novel &quot;Haze&quot; imagines a far future conspiracy of so-called &quot;Danites&quot; in the Utah city of St. George.

Thriller writer Steve Berry incorporates Danite and blood atonement lore in a contemporary setting in his 2014 novel &quot;The Lincoln Myth&quot;.

<doc id="377931" wikidata="Q1850768" url="?curid=377931" title="Seismic tomography">
<text>Seismic tomography or seismotomography is a technique for imaging the subsurface of the Earth using seismic waves. The properties of seismic waves are modified by the material through which they travel. By comparing the differences in seismic waves recorded at different locations, it is possible to create a model of the subsurface structure. Most commonly, these seismic waves are generated by earthquakes or man-made sources such as explosions. Different types of waves, including P, S, Rayleigh, and Love waves can be used for tomographic images, though each comes with their own benefits and downsides and are used depending on the geologic setting, seismometer coverage, distance from nearby earthquakes, and required resolution. The model created by tomographic imaging is almost always a seismic velocity model, and features within this model may be interpreted as structural, thermal, or compositional variations. Geoscientists apply seismic tomography to a wide variety of settings in which the subsurface structure is of interest, ranging in scale from whole-Earth structure to the upper few meters below the surface.

== Theory ==
Tomography is solved as an inverse problem. Seismic data are compared to an initial Earth model and the model is modified until the best possible fit between the model predictions and observed data is found. Seismic waves would travel in straight lines if Earth was of uniform composition, but structural, chemical, and thermal variations affect the properties of seismic waves, most importantly their velocity, leading to the reflection and refraction of these waves. The location and magnitude of variations in the subsurface can be calculated by the inversion process, although solutions to tomographic inversions are non-unique. Most commonly, only the travel time of the seismic waves is considered in the inversion. However, advances in modeling techniques and computing power have allowed different parts, or the entirety, of the measured seismic waveform to be fit during the inversion.

Seismic tomography is similar to medical x-ray computed tomography (CT scan) in that a computer processes receiver data to produce a 3D image, although CT scans use attenuation instead of travel-time difference. Seismic tomography has to deal with the analysis of curved ray paths which are reflected and refracted within the Earth, and potential uncertainty in the location of the earthquake hypocenter. CT scans use linear x-rays and a known source.

== History ==
In the early 20th century, seismologists first used travel time variations in seismic waves from earthquakes to make discoveries such as the existence of the Moho and the depth to the outer core. While these findings shared some underlying principles with seismic tomography, modern tomography itself was not developed until the 1970s with the expansion of global seismic networks. Networks like the World-Wide Standardized Seismograph Network were initially motivated by underground nuclear tests, but quickly showed the benefits of their accessible, standardized datasets for geoscience. These developments occurred concurrently with advancements in modeling techniques and computing power that were required to solve large inverse problems and generate theoretical seismograms, which are required to test the accuracy of a model. As early as 1972, researchers successfully used some of the underlying principles of modern seismic tomography to search for fast and slow areas in the subsurface.

The first widely cited publication that largely resembles modern seismic tomography was published in 1976 and used local earthquakes to determine the 3D velocity structure beneath Southern California. The following year, P wave delay times were used to create 2D velocity maps of the whole Earth at several depth ranges, representing an early 3D model. The first model using iterative techniques, which improve upon an initial model in small steps and are required when there are a large number of unknowns, was done in 1984. The model was made possible by iterating upon the first radially anisotropic Earth model, created in 1981. A radially anisotropic Earth model describes changes in material properties, specifically seismic velocity, along a radial path through the Earth, and assumes this profile is valid for every path from the core to the surface. This 1984 study was also the first to apply the term &quot;tomography&quot; to seismology, as the term had originated in the medical field with X-ray tomography.

Seismic tomography has continued to improve in the past several decades since its initial conception. The development of adjoint inversions, which are able to combine several different types of seismic data into a single inversion, help negate some of the trade-offs associated with any individual data type. Historically, seismic waves have been modeled as 1D rays, a method referred to as &quot;ray theory&quot; that is relatively simple to model and can usually fit travel-time data well. However, recorded seismic waveforms contain much more information than just travel-time and are affected by a much wider path than is assumed by ray theory. Methods like the finite-frequency method attempt to account for this within the framework of ray theory. More recently, the development of &quot;full waveform&quot; or &quot;waveform&quot; tomography has abandoned ray theory entirely. This method models seismic wave propagation in its full complexity and can yield more accurate images of the subsurface. Originally these inversions were developed in exploration seismology in the 1980s and 1990s and were too computationally complex for global and regional scale studies, but development of numerical modeling methods to simulate seismic waves has allowed waveform tomography to become more common.

== Process ==
Seismic tomography uses seismic records to create 2D and 3D models of the subsurface through an inverse problem that minimizes the difference between the created model and the observed seismic data. Various methods are used to resolve anomalies in the crust, lithosphere, mantle, and core based on the availability of data and types of seismic waves that pass through the region. Longer wavelengths penetrate deeper into the Earth, but seismic waves are not sensitive to features significantly smaller than their wavelength and therefore provide a lower resolution. Different methods also make different assumptions, which can have a large effect on the image created. For example, commonly used tomographic methods work by iteratively improving an initial input model, and thus can produce unrealistic results if the initial model is unreasonable.

P wave data are used in most local models and global models in areas with sufficient earthquake and seismograph density. S and surface wave data are used in global models when this coverage is not sufficient, such as in ocean basins and away from subduction zones. First-arrival times are the most widely used, but models utilizing reflected and refracted phases are used in more complex models, such as those imaging the core. Differential traveltimes between wave phases or types are also used.

=== Local tomography ===
Local tomographic models are often based on a temporary seismic array targeting specific areas, unless in a seismically active region with extensive permanent network coverage. These allow for the imaging of the crust and upper mantle.
* &quot;Diffraction and wave equation tomography&quot; use the full waveform, rather than just the first arrival times. The inversion of amplitude and phases of all arrivals provide more detailed density information than transmission traveltime alone. Despite the theoretical appeal, these methods are not widely employed because of the computing expense and difficult inversions.
* &quot;Reflection tomography&quot; originated with exploration geophysics. It uses an artificial source to resolve small-scale features at crustal depths. &quot;Wide-angle tomography&quot; is similar, but with a wide source to receiver offset. This allows for the detection of seismic waves refracted from sub-crustal depths and can determine continental architecture and details of plate margins. These two methods are often used together.
* &quot;Local earthquake tomography&quot; is used in seismically active regions with sufficient seismometer coverage. Given the proximity between source and receivers, a precise earthquake focus location must be known. This requires the simultaneous iteration of both structure and focus locations in model calculations.
* &quot;Teleseismic tomography&quot; uses waves from distant earthquakes that deflect upwards to a local seismic array. The models can reach depths similar to the array aperture, typically to depths for imaging the crust and lithosphere (a few hundred kilometers). The waves travel near 30° from vertical, creating a vertical distortion to compact features.

=== Regional or global tomography ===

Regional to global scale tomographic models are generally based on long wavelengths. Various models have better agreement with each other than local models due to the large feature size they image, such as subducted slabs and superplumes. The trade off from whole mantle to whole Earth coverage is the coarse resolution (hundreds of kilometers) and difficulty imaging small features (e.g. narrow plumes). Although often used to image different parts of the subsurface, P and S wave derived models broadly agree where there is image overlap. These models use data from both permanent seismic stations and supplementary temporary arrays.
* First arrival traveltime &quot;P wave&quot; data are used to generate the highest resolution tomographic images of the mantle. These models are limited to regions with sufficient seismograph coverage and earthquake density, therefore cannot be used for areas such as inactive plate interiors and ocean basins without seismic networks. Other phases of P waves are used to image the deeper mantle and core.
* In areas with limited seismograph or earthquake coverage, multiple phases of &quot;S waves&quot; can be used for tomographic models. These are of lower resolution than P wave models, due to the distances involved and fewer bounce-phase data available. S waves can also be used in conjunction with P waves for differential arrival time models.
* &quot;Surface waves&quot; can be used for tomography of the crust and upper mantle where no body wave (P and S) data are available. Both Rayleigh and Love waves can be used. The low frequency waves lead to low resolution models, therefore these models have difficulty with crustal structure. &quot;Free oscillations&quot;, or normal mode seismology, are the long wavelength, low frequency movements of the surface of the Earth which can be thought of as a type of surface wave. The frequencies of these oscillations can be obtained through Fourier transformation of seismic data. The models based on this method are of broad scale, but have the advantage of relatively uniform data coverage as compared to data sourced directly from earthquakes.
* &quot;Attenuation tomography&quot; attempts to extract the anelastic signal from the elastic-dominated waveform of seismic waves. Generally, it is assumed that seismic waves behave elastically, meaning individual rock particles that are displaced by the seismic wave eventually return to their original position. However, a comparatively small amount of permanent deformation does occur, which adds up to significant energy loss over large distances. This anelastic behavior is called attenuation, and in certain conditions can become just as important as the elastic response. It has been shown that the contribution of anelasticity to seismic velocity is highly sensitive to temperature, so attenuation tomography can help determine if a velocity feature is caused by a thermal or chemical variation, which can be ambiguous when assuming a purely elastic response.
* &quot;Ambient noise tomography&quot; uses random seismic waves generated by oceanic and atmospheric disturbances to recover the velocities of surface waves. Assuming ambient seismic noise is equal in amplitude and frequency content from all directions, cross-correlating the ambient noise recorded at two seismometers for the same time period should produce only seismic energy that travels from one station to the other. This allows one station to be treated as a &quot;virtual source&quot; of surface waves sent to the other station, the &quot;virtual receiver&quot;. These surface waves are sensitive to the seismic velocity of the Earth at different depths depending on their period. A major advantage of this method is that it does not require an earthquake or man-made source. A disadvantage of the method is that an individual cross-correlation can be quite noisy due to the complexity of the real ambient noise field. Thus, many individual correlations over a shorter time period, typically one day, need to be created and averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. While this has often required very large amounts of seismic data recorded over multiple years, more recent studies have successfully used much shorter time periods to create tomographic images with ambient noise.
* Waveforms are usually modeled as rays due to ray theory being significantly less complex to model than the full seismic wave equations. However, seismic waves are affected by the material properties of a wide area surrounding the ray path, not just the material through which the ray passes directly. The finite frequency effect is the result the surrounding medium has on a seismic record. &quot;Finite frequency tomography&quot; accounts for this in determining both travel time and amplitude anomalies, increasing image resolution. This has the ability to resolve much larger variations (i.e. 10–30%) in material properties.

== Applications ==
Seismic tomography can resolve anisotropy, anelasticity, density, and bulk sound velocity. Variations in these parameters may be a result of thermal or chemical differences, which are attributed to processes such as mantle plumes, subducting slabs, and mineral phase changes. Larger scale features that can be imaged with tomography include the high velocities beneath continental shields and low velocities under ocean spreading centers.

=== Hotspots ===

The mantle plume hypothesis proposes that areas of volcanism not readily explained by plate tectonics, called hotspots, are a result of thermal upwelling within the mantle. Some researchers have proposed an upper mantle source above the 660km discontinuity for these plumes, while others propose a much deeper source, possibly at the core-mantle boundary.

While the source of mantle plumes has been highly debated since they were first proposed in the 1970s, most modern studies argue in favor of mantle plumes originating at or near the core-mantle boundary. This is in large part due to tomographic images that reveal both the plumes themselves as well as large low-velocity zones in the deep mantle that likely contribute to the formation of mantle plumes. These large low-shear velocity provinces as well as smaller ultra low velocity zones have been consistently observed across many tomographic models of the deep Earth

=== Subduction Zones ===
Subducting plates are colder than the mantle into which they are moving. This creates a fast anomaly that is visible in tomographic images. Tomographic images have been made of most subduction zones around the world and have provided insight into the geometries of the crust and upper mantle in these areas. These images have revealed that subducting plates vary widely in how steeply they move into the mantle. Tomographic images have also seen features such as deeper portions of the subducting plate tearing off from the upper portion.

=== Other Applications ===
Tomography can be used to image faults to better understand their seismic hazard. This can be through imaging the fault itself by seeing differences in seismic velocity across the fault boundary or by determining near-surface velocity structure, which can have a large impact on the magnitude on the amplitude of ground-shaking during an earthquake due to site amplification effects. Near-surface velocity structure from tomographic images can also be useful for other hazards, such as monitoring of landslides for changes in near-surface moisture content which has an effect on both seismic velocity and potential for future landslides.

Tomographic images of volcanoes have yielded new insights into properties of the underlying magmatic system. These images have most commonly been used to estimate the depth and volume of magma stored in the crust, but have also been used to constrain properties such as the geometry, temperature, or chemistry of the magma. It is important to note that both lab experiments and tomographic imaging studies have shown that recovering these properties from seismic velocity alone can be difficult due to the complexity of seismic wave propagation through focused zones of hot, potentially melted rocks.

While comparatively primitive to tomography on Earth, seismic tomography has been proposed on other bodies in the solar system and successfully used on the Moon. Data collected from four seismometers placed by the Apollo missions have been used many times to create 1-D velocity profiles for the moon, and less commonly 3-D tomographic models. Tomography relies on having multiple seismometers, but tomography-adjacent methods for constraining Earth structure have been used on other planets. While on Earth these methods are often used in combination with seismic tomography models to better constrain the locations of subsurface features, they can still provide useful information about the interiors of other planetary bodies when only a single seismometer is available. For example, data gathered by the SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure) instrument on InSight on Mars has been able to detect the Martian core.

== Limitations ==
Global seismic networks have expanded steadily since the 1960s, but are still concentrated on continents and in seismically active regions. Oceans, particularly in the southern hemisphere, are under-covered. Temporary seismic networks have helped improve tomographic models in regions of particular interest, but typically only collect data for months to a few years. The uneven distribution of earthquakes biases tomographic models towards seismically active regions. Methods that do not rely on earthquakes such as active source surveys or ambient noise tomography have helped image areas with little to no seismicity, though these both have their own limitations as compared to earthquake-based tomography.

The type of seismic wave used in a model limits the resolution it can achieve. Longer wavelengths are able to penetrate deeper into the Earth, but can only be used to resolve large features. Finer resolution can be achieved with surface waves, with the trade off that they cannot be used in models deeper than the crust and upper mantle. The disparity between wavelength and feature scale causes anomalies to appear of reduced magnitude and size in images. P and S wave models respond differently to the types of anomalies. Models based solely on the wave that arrives first naturally prefer faster pathways, causing models based on these data to have lower resolution of slow (often hot) features. This can prove to be a significant issue in areas such as volcanoes where rocks are much hotter than their surroundings and oftentimes partially melted. Shallow models must also consider the significant lateral velocity variations in continental crust.

Because seismometers have only been deployed in large numbers since the late-20th century, tomography is only capable of viewing changes in velocity structure over decades. For example, tectonic plates only move at millimeters per year, so the total amount of change in geologic structure due to plate tectonics since the development of seismic tomography is several orders of magnitude lower than the finest resolution possible with modern seismic networks. However, seismic tomography has still been used to view near-surface velocity structure changes at time scales of years to months.

Tomographic solutions are non-unique. Although statistical methods can be used to analyze the validity of a model, unresolvable uncertainty remains. This contributes to difficulty comparing the validity of different model results.

Computing power limits the amount of seismic data, number of unknowns, mesh size, and iterations in tomographic models. This is of particular importance in ocean basins, which due to limited network coverage and earthquake density require more complex processing of distant data. Shallow oceanic models also require smaller model mesh size due to the thinner crust.

Tomographic images are typically presented with a color ramp representing the strength of the anomalies. This has the consequence of making equal changes appear of differing magnitude based on visual perceptions of color, such as the change from orange to red being more subtle than blue to yellow. The degree of color saturation can also visually skew interpretations. These factors should be considered when analyzing images.

<text>The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets is a rock band from Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada. Their music largely consists of often tongue-in-cheek homages to the works of H. P. Lovecraft, specifically the Cthulhu Mythos.

==History==
===Band formation (1992)===
The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets formed in January 1992 after meeting at Fraser Valley College in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Lead singer Toren Atkinson and lead guitarist Warren Banks formed the band so they could open for local group Mystery Machine. Even though they &quot;had no musical training or experience&quot; they were able to create a three song set list and play the opening act for their first show.

The band&#x27;s name is drawn from a phrase in Lovecraft&#x27;s story &quot;The Tomb&quot;: &quot;I will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets&quot;. Atkinson and Banks decided to create a band around the Cthulhu mythos because it was a topic they were interested in, and it was a unique &quot;niche that [needed] to be filled&quot;.

In their early years the band produced three demo tapes: &quot;Gurgle Gurgle Gurgle&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Hurts Like Hell!&quot;, and &quot;Cthulhuriffomania&quot;. Most of the songs were later re-released on other albums.

===&quot;Cthulhu Strikes Back&quot; (1995)===
The band&#x27;s first CD release was &quot;Cthulhu Strikes Back&quot;. &quot;Cthulhu Strikes Back&quot; was re-released as a Special Edition in 2003, containing two new songs.
===&quot;Great Old Ones&quot; (1996)===
In 1996 the band released &quot;Great Old Ones&quot;.

===&quot;Spaceship Zero&quot; (2000)===

In 2000 the Thickets released &quot;Spaceship Zero: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;. The singer Toren said the album was &quot;heavily inspired by the science fiction movies and reruns we’d all grown up with like Lost in Space and Angry Red Planet&quot;. &quot;Spaceship Zero&quot; was released under a new record label, Divine Industries.

===&quot;Let Sleeping Gods Lie&quot; (2002)===
In 2002 the Thickets collaborated with Wizards of the Coast to release &quot;Let Sleeping Gods Lie&quot; - an all-Cthulhu Mythos themed CD. The album was used to promote Wizards&#x27; new d20 edition of the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game. The album contained twelve previously-released Thickets tracks, and had a special tie-in with the Call of Cthulhu game rules. If the CD is played during a roleplaying session, the game contains rules for die roll modifiers that take effect depending on what song is currently playing.

===&quot;The Shadow Out of Tim&quot; (2007)===
&quot;The Shadow Out of Tim&quot; is the Thickets&#x27; second theme album, after &quot;Spaceship Zero&quot;. The title is a play on words from the H.P Lovecraft short story &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot;. The album is an adaptation and a rock opera based on Lovecraft&#x27;s story. The album recounts the tale of a marine biologist who found his body had &quot;been possessed by an alien intelligence&quot; and works to find out what happened. The album was released at the Summer Solstice (June 21) 2007.

Among the songs recorded during &quot;The Shadow Out of Tim&quot; sessions were &quot;Shhh...&quot; and &quot;(We&#x27;re Gonna) Kill the Chupacabra (Tonight).&quot; They were not included on the album as they &quot;didn’t fit in with the [album] narrative&quot;. Both were later released on &quot;The Dukes of Alhazred&quot; in 2017.

In 2009 the &quot;Shadow Out Of Tim&quot; song &quot;Blackout&quot; was nominated for the 8th Annual Independent Music Awards for Hard Rock/Metal Song of the year.

===PAX, Child&#x27;s Play, and Rock Band (2008)===
In 2008 the Thickets were invited to play at the Penny Arcade Expo. Their performance at the event led to their previously unreleased song &quot;Shhh...&quot; being included as a downloadable track in the PAX 2008 Collection for the video game Rock Band. A Thickets song was also included on the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play CD 2008&quot; compilation.

In December that year the Thickets organized a fundraiser dubbed &quot;Cthulhupalooza&quot;. The event included a show by the band, as well as screening of The Call of Cthulhu and a Rock Band contest. The winner of the Rock Band contest won the opportunity to perform a Rock Band song with the Thickets. Proceeds from the event were donated to Child&#x27;s Play charity. A second Cthulhupalooza festival was run in 2011. 

===&quot;The Dukes of Alhazred&quot; (2017)===
In March 2016 the Thickets launched an Indiegogo campaign to fund creation of a new album. The album successfully funded later that year. The album was released in 2017 with the title &quot;The Dukes of Alhazred&quot;. A Stranger Aeons review said &quot;If you like some catchy rock with your cosmic horror, The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets are your guys!&quot; In 2018 the Thickets won the &quot;Rock&quot; category for the Fraser Valley Music Awards.

===Upcoming sixth album (since 2022)===
In September 2022, the band announced on Facebook that they had started working on their sixth album.

== Musical style ==
Lead singer Toren Atkinson classified the Thickets&#x27; music as &quot;rock and roll&quot; and &quot;power pop&quot;. Toren notes that they try to be creative and original with their music and ideas. &quot;One thing I’m proud of ... is that while we don’t necessarily take a Lovecraft poem or story and directly put it to music ... [our songs are] steeped in Lovecraftian lore. We make ... the Cthulhu Mythos our own by putting it in a more punk-rock milieu and a distinctly new, and often tongue-in-cheek, place&quot;. 

In &quot;The Strange Sound of Cthulhu: Music Inspired by the Writings of H.P. Lovecraft&quot;, Gary Hill described &quot;One Gilled Girl&quot; from &quot;Great Old Ones&quot; as &quot;The Ramones take on H. P. Lovecraft&quot;. Hill describes several Thickets songs as having &quot;thrash and punk influences merge&quot;.

Several reviewers have specifically called out praise for the Thickets&#x27; song lyrics. A review in
The Unspeakable Oath said &quot;the lyrics really are what sets this band apart&quot;. For his part, lyric author Toren Atkinson said &quot;I like to challenge myself when writing music. I love playing with language&quot;.

Toren notes that he tries to use the Thickets&#x27; music to spread knowledge of Lovecraft and other related topics. &quot;I try to use our music to promote literacy and that includes scientific literacy, but I don’t let that goal get in the way of our number one mandate: goofiness&quot;. &quot;Trying new things and being fun is our core ethos&quot;.

=== Creative process ===
While the singer Toren admits to writing &quot;95% of the band&#x27;s lyrics&quot;, he attests that the rest of the Thickets&#x27; creation process is a group effort. &quot;Usually when we practice, one or more of us will come with some melodies and riffs we’ve cooked up over the past couple weeks, and we &#x27;jam it out&#x27; until we either get a song or we get sick of it&quot;. He also notes that the band uses deadlines as external motivation to create: &quot;As a collection of lazy procrastinators, we will usually &#x27;throw our hat over the fence&#x27; by booking time at a recording studio. Then we have x months/weeks to come up with an album&quot;.

Toren notes that they also reach out to the Thickets fan base for help when they need special subject expertise. &quot;For example, for &quot;The Math Song&quot; and &quot;Dies Ist Unverschamtheit&quot; I had a brain friend help me with the algebraic equation and the German lyrics, respectively. On The Shadow Out of Tim, I put the call out ... for help with writing the Middle Egyptian lyrics&quot;.

== Costuming ==
A large part of The Thickets live shows involves the band members wearing &quot;imaginative and bizarre&quot; stage costumes. The outfits are usually Cthulhu Mythos-themed. The band has gone through various iterations over the years, from plush gug and fungi from Yuggoth outfits to the red jumpsuit/astronaut motif for their Spaceship Zero concerts, to their Satyr costumes, and most recently, their early twentieth century nautical styles featuring mustaches.

== Shows ==
The Thickets have toured across North America a few times, performing with such bands as GWAR, Dayglo Abortions, MC Frontalot, Freezepop, BlöödHag, Bad Brains and Nomeansno. They played at Dragon Con in 1997. The Thickets opened for They Might Be Giants at GenCon in 1998. They were invited to play at the first annual H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival in 1996, and returned to play at the festival for three years afterward. They returned again to play at the festival in 2008 and Anime Evolution in 2010.

== Members ==
The original three members of the band, at the January 1992 formation, were Toren Atkinson, Warren Banks and Quentin Rogers. Quentin, though, never appeared on any of their releases, nor played at any of their public performances. The first bass player to appear with the band at a show was Devon Presseau. The band has gone through several bassists and drummers since its inception. Thomas R. Falk has toured and played with the band as a second guitarist.

The current line-up of the band consists of vocalist and lyricist Toren Atkinson, guitarist Warren Banks, guitarist/bassist Mario Nieva, drummer Jordan Pratt (former drummer for the band Mystery Machine), and bassist/backup vocalist Merrick Atkinson.

=== Timeline ===

=== Side projects ===
Several members have other artistic side projects outside of the band. Lead singer Toren Atkinson co-hosted a science/comedy podcast named &quot;Caustic Soda&quot;. Drummer Jordan Pratt, former bassist/video director Bob Fugger, and former guitarist Chris Woods formed and co-hosted comedy podcast &quot;Speedway Squad&quot;. Upon Fugger&#x27;s departure, Pratt and Woods were joined by Thickets guitarist Warren Banks to create a new podcast, &quot;Horsetrack Hooligans&quot;.

Toren Atkinson is also an artist, having illustrated books for several role-playing games including &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Call of Cthulhu (and Delta Green)&quot;, as well as the Lovecraft-inspired collectible card game &quot;Mythos&quot;. Warren Banks and Toren Atkinson also co-wrote the roleplaying game Spaceship Zero, published by Green Ronin Publishing, along with contributions by John Scott Tynes and Monte Cook.

<doc id="377933" wikidata="Q2633267" url="?curid=377933" title="Atypical pneumonia">
<text>Atypical pneumonia, also known as walking pneumonia, is any type of pneumonia not caused by one of the pathogens most commonly associated with the disease. Its clinical presentation contrasts to that of &quot;typical&quot; pneumonia. A variety of microorganisms can cause it. When it develops independently from another disease, it is called primary atypical pneumonia (PAP).

The term was introduced in the 1930s and was contrasted with the bacterial pneumonia caused by &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, at that time the best known and most commonly occurring form of pneumonia. The distinction was historically considered important, as it differentiated those more likely to present with &quot;typical&quot; respiratory symptoms and lobar pneumonia from those more likely to present with &quot;atypical&quot; generalized symptoms (such as fever, headache, sweating and myalgia) and bronchopneumonia.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Usually, the atypical causes also involve atypical symptoms:
* No response to common antibiotics such as sulfonamide and beta-lactams like penicillin.
* No signs and symptoms of lobar consolidation, meaning that the infection is restricted to small areas, rather than involving a whole lobe. As the disease progresses, however, the look can tend to lobar pneumonia.
* Absence of leukocytosis.
* Extrapulmonary symptoms, related to the causing organism.
* Moderate amount of sputum, or no sputum at all (i.e. non-productive).
* Lack of alveolar exudate.
* Despite general symptoms and problems with the upper respiratory tract (such as high fever, headache, a dry irritating cough followed later by a productive cough with radiographs showing consolidation), there are in general few physical signs. The patient looks better than the symptoms suggest.
*Silent hypoxia may occur and not be noticed, but will be picked up by pulse oximetry.

==Cause==
The most common causative organisms are (often intracellular living) bacteria:

;&quot;Chlamydia pneumoniae&quot;: Mild form of pneumonia with relatively mild symptoms.
;&quot;Chlamydia psittaci&quot;: Causes psittacosis.
;&quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot;: Causes Q fever.
;&quot;Francisella tularensis&quot;: Causes tularemia.
;&quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;: Causes a severe form of pneumonia with a relatively high mortality rate, known as legionellosis or Legionnaires&#x27; disease.
;&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;: Usually occurs in younger age groups and may be associated with neurological and systemic (e.g. rashes) symptoms. See Mycoplasma pneumonia.

Atypical pneumonia can also have a fungal, protozoan, or viral cause.In the past, most organisms were difficult to culture. However, newer techniques aid in the definitive identification of the pathogen, which may lead to more individualized treatment plans.

===Viral===

Known viral causes of atypical pneumonia include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),
and measles.

== Diagnosis ==

Chest radiographs (X-ray photographs) often show a pulmonary infection before physical signs of atypical pneumonia are observable at all.
This is occult pneumonia. In general, occult pneumonia is rather often present in patients with pneumonia and can also be caused by &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, as the decrease of occult pneumonia after vaccination of children with a pneumococcal vaccine suggests.

Infiltration commonly begins in the perihilar region (where the bronchus begins) and spreads in a wedge- or fan-shaped fashion toward the periphery of the lung field. The process most often involves the lower lobe but may affect any lobe or combination of lobes.

== Epidemiology ==

Mycoplasma is found more often in younger than in older people.
Older people are more often infected by Legionella.

==Terminology==
&quot;Primary atypical pneumonia&quot; is called &quot;primary&quot; because it develops independently of other diseases.

It is commonly known as &quot;walking pneumonia&quot; because its symptoms are often mild enough that one can still be up and about.

&quot;Atypical pneumonia&quot; is &quot;atypical&quot; in that it is caused by atypical organisms (other than &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, and &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;).
These atypical organisms include special bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. In addition, this form of pneumonia is atypical in presentation with only moderate amounts of sputum, no consolidation, only small increases in white cell counts, and no alveolar exudate.

At the time that atypical pneumonia was first described, organisms like Mycoplasma, Chlamydophila, and Legionella were not yet recognized as bacteria and instead considered viruses. Hence &quot;atypical pneumonia&quot; was also called &quot;non-bacterial&quot;.

In literature the term &quot;atypical pneumonia&quot; is current, sometimes contrasted with &quot;viral pneumonia&quot; (see above) and sometimes, though incorrectly, with &quot;bacterial pneumonia&quot;. Many of the organisms causative of atypical pneumonia are unusual types of bacteria (&quot;Mycoplasma&quot; is a type of bacteria without a cell wall and &quot;Chlamydias&quot; are intracellular bacteria). As the conditions caused by the various agents have different courses and respond to different treatments, the identification of the specific causative pathogen is important.

<text>Teatro La Fenice (, &quot;The Phoenix&quot;) is a historic opera house in Venice, Italy. It is one of &quot;the most famous and renowned landmarks in the history of Italian theatre&quot; and in the history of opera as a whole. Especially in the 19th century, La Fenice became the site of many famous operatic premieres at which the works of several of the four major bel canto era composers—Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi—were performed.

Its name reflects its role in permitting an opera company to &quot;rise from the ashes&quot; despite losing the use of three theatres to fire, the first in 1774 after the city&#x27;s leading house was destroyed and rebuilt but not opened until 1792; the second fire came in 1836, but rebuilding was completed within a year. The third fire was the result of arson, and destroyed the house in 1996 leaving only the exterior walls; it was rebuilt and re-opened in November 2004. In order to celebrate this event, the tradition of the Venice New Year&#x27;s Concert started.

==History==

Seven old theaters were active in Venice at the end of the eighteenth century, two for the production of plays and the others for music. The grandest of these was the Teatro San Benedetto, which stood on the site currently occupied by the Rossini cinema. Built by the Grimani family in 1755, it was subsequently assigned to the Nobile Società di Palchettisti (Noble Association of Box-holders). However, following a judicial ruling in 1787, this association was expelled and forced to give up the opera house to the noble Venier family, the owners of the land on which it was built.
The association immediately proposed building a larger and more sumptuous opera house than the one it had lost, which would become the symbol of their changing fortunes and their capacity for ′rebirth′. It was therefore to be called &quot;La Fenice&quot;, like the mythical, immortal bird able to rise out of its own ashes, to symbolise the association&#x27;s splendid rebirth after its misfortunes.
The piece of land between Contrada Santa Maria Zobenigo and Contrada Sant&#x27;Angelo was bought for the purpose in 1790 and the private houses on it were demolished. A competition was then announced for the design of the opera house, and the committee of experts selected the work of the architect Giannantonio Selva from the 29 plans submitted.
Work began in 1791 and was completed just 18 months later, in April 1792.
&quot;La Fenice&quot; immediately made its mark as one of the leading opera houses, noted in Italy and Europe both for the high artistic quality of its work and the splendour of its building. But, almost as if the name were the bearer of bad omens, on the night of 13 December 1836 the opera house was devastated by a first fire caused by a recently installed Austrian heater. The newspapers said it took three days and three nights to put out the fire and that various hotspots were still smouldering among the debris 18 days later. The flames entirely destroyed the house, and only the foyer and the Sale Apollinee were saved.
The association decided to proceed with its immediate reconstruction. It appointed the architect Giambattista Meduna and his engineer brother Tommaso to carry out the work, while Tranquillo Orsi was responsible for the decorations. The work began in February 1837 and performances were temporarily staged in the Teatro Apollo (previously the San Luca, now Goldoni).

Everything was completed in record time. By the evening of 26 December of the same year, the new opera house, reborn in the new artistic style of the age, was opened to the public. The speed of the work, however, led to urgent restoration works to the framework being required as early as 1854 and, again under the direction of Giambattista Meduna, the house was redecorated in a style that remained unchanged until 1996. 
On 23 July 1935 the box-holder owners ceded their share in the opera house to the Comune di Venezia, so it went from private to public ownership, and in 1937-8 part of building was subject to further major restorations and alterations by engineer Eugenio Miozzi.
On the night of 29 January 1996, during a period of closure for restoration works, a second fire – as the Myth said – this time arson, completely destroyed the house and most of the Sale Apollinee. Once again La Fenice rose again, faithfully reconstructed to a plan by the architect Aldo Rossi, and was reopened on 14 December 2003.

===First theatre===
In 1774, the Teatro San Benedetto, which had been Venice&#x27;s leading opera house for more than forty years, burned to the ground. By 1789, with interest from a number of wealthy opera lovers who wanted a spectacular new house, &quot;a carefully defined competition&quot; was organised to find a suitable architect. It was won by Gianantonio Selva who proposed a neoclassical style building with 170 identical boxes in tiers in a traditional horseshoe shaped auditorium, which had been the favoured style since it was introduced as early as 1642 in Venice. The house would face on one side a &quot;campo&quot;, or small plaza, and on the other a canal, with an entrance which gave direct access backstage and into the theatre.

However, the process was not without controversy especially in regard to the aesthetics of the building. Some thirty responses were received and, as Romanelli accounts, Selva&#x27;s was designated as the design to be constructed, the actual award for best design went to his chief rival, Pietro Bianchi. However, Selva&#x27;s design and finished opera house appears to have been of high quality and the one best suited to the limitations of the physical space it was obliged to inhabit.

Construction began in June 1790, and by May 1792 the theatre was completed. It was named &quot;La Fenice&quot;, in reference to the company&#x27;s survival, first of the fire, then of the loss of its former quarters. La Fenice was inaugurated on 16 May 1792, with an opera by Giovanni Paisiello entitled &quot;I giuochi d&#x27;Agrigento&quot; set to a libretto by Alessandro Pepoli.

But no sooner had the opera house been rebuilt than a legal dispute broke out between the company managing it and the owners, the Venier family. The issue was decided in favor of the Veniers.

At the beginning of the 19th century, La Fenice acquired a European reputation. Rossini mounted two major productions there: &quot;Tancredi&quot; in 1813 and &quot;Semiramide&quot; in 1823. Two of Bellini&#x27;s operas were given their premieres there: &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot; in March 1830 and &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot; in March 1833. Donizetti, fresh from his triumphs at La Scala in Milan and at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, returned to Venice in 1836 with his &quot;Belisario&quot;, after an absence of seventeen years.

===Second theatre===
In December 1836, disaster struck again when the theatre was destroyed by fire. However, it was quickly rebuilt with a design provided by the architect-engineer team of the brothers Tommaso and Giovanni Battista Meduna. The interior displays a late-Empire luxury of gilt decorations, plushy extravagance and stucco. La Fenice once again rose from its ashes to open its doors on the evening of 26 December 1837.

Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s association with La Fenice began in 1844, with the premiere performance of &quot;Ernani&quot; during the carnival season. Over the next 13 years, the premieres of &quot;Attila&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, and &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; took place there.

During the First World War, La Fenice was closed, but it reopened to become the scene of much activity, attracting many of the world&#x27;s greatest singers and conductors. In 1930, the Venice Biennale initiated the First International Festival of Contemporary Music, which brought such composers as Stravinsky and Britten, and more recently Berio, Nono, and Bussotti, to write for La Fenice.

On 29 January 1996, La Fenice was completely destroyed by fire. Only its acoustics were preserved, since Lamberto Tronchin, an Italian acoustician, had measured the acoustics two months earlier.

Arson was immediately suspected. In March 2001, a court in Venice found two electricians, Enrico Carella and his cousin Massimiliano Marchetti, guilty of setting the fire. They appeared to have set the building ablaze because their company was facing heavy fines over delays in repair work in which they were engaged. Carella, the company&#x27;s owner, disappeared after a final appeal was turned down. He had been sentenced to seven years in prison. Marchetti surrendered and served a six-year sentence. Ultimately, Carella was arrested in February 2007 at the Mexico-Belize border, was extradited to Italy, and was released on day parole after serving 16 months.

===Present theatre===

After various delays, reconstruction began in earnest in 2001. In 650 days, a team of 200 plasterers, artists, woodworkers, and other craftsmen succeeded in recreating the ambiance of the old theatre, at a cost of some €90 million. As Gillian Price notes, &quot;This time round, thanks to an enlightened project by late Italian architect Aldo Rossi and the motto &#x27;how it was, where it was&#x27;, it has been fitted out with extra rehearsal areas and state-of-the-art stage equipment, while the seating capacity has been increased from 840 to 1000.&quot;
La Fenice was rebuilt in 19th-century style on the basis of a design by architect Aldo Rossi who, in order to obtain details of its design, used still photographs from the opening scenes of Luchino Visconti&#x27;s film &quot;Senso&quot; (1954), which had been filmed in the house. La Fenice reopened on 14 December 2003 with an inaugural concert of Beethoven, Wagner, and Stravinsky. The first staged opera was a production of &quot;La traviata&quot;, in November 2004.

Critical response to the rebuilt La Fenice was mixed. The music critic of the paper &quot;Il Tempo&quot;, Enrico Cavalotti, was satisfied. He found the colours a bit bright but the sound good and compact. However, for his colleague Dino Villatico of the &quot;La Repubblica&quot;, the acoustics of the new hall lacked resonance, and the colours were painfully bright. He found it &quot;kitsch, a fake imitation of the past&quot;. He said that &quot;the city should have had the nerve to build a completely new theater; Venice betrayed its innovative past by ignoring it&quot;.

==Artistic notes==
===Façade===
Built in 1792 to a plan by the architect Giannantonio Selva, the façade of the building is the only element to have completely survived the two fires that almost entirely destroyed the opera house in 1836 and 1996.
Unlike the other theaters in the city, whose entrances are in secluded places like alleys and small squares, La Fenice is the only historic Venetian theatre facing onto an open space, Campo San Fantin. It is also the only one to feature a colonnade in neo-classical style in its façade. This bears the theatre&#x27;s insignia in the centre portraying the phoenix that rises from the flames, carved in 1837 to design by Giambattista Meduna. The façade features two statues in niches representing the muses of tragedy and dance: Melpomene and Terpsichore. Above them are the masks of Comedy and Tragedy, thought to be by Domenico Fadiga. 
The first sculptures that adorned the entrance to the opera house, in terracotta and carved in Baroque style, were attributed to either Giuseppe Bernardi or his nephew Giovanni Ferrari, both of whom taught Canova.
They were replaced in 1875 as they were in an advanced state of decay and were in any case thought incompatible, if restored, with the classical style of the façade. The two new statues were made in Custoza stone by Augusto Benvenuti in a new style that better suited the building. All trace of the original sculptures was lost after the theatre management sold them to Benvenuti in 1876.
Two commemorative stelae were placed in the entrance vestibule after the 1837 reconstruction. The one on the right, sculpted in that year by Antonio Giaccarelli to an original design by Giambattista Meduna, is attributed to the architect Giannantonio Selva. The one on the left, in honour of the playwright Carlo Goldoni, is by Luigi Zandomeneghi and was moved from the atrium where it had been dedicated on 26 December 1830. The new sign of the opera house, in gold and blue, again to a design By Meduna, was also placed above the entrance in 1837.

===Foyer===

Escaping entirely unharmed from the first fire that destroyed the original La Fenice Opera House on the night of December 1836, the entrance, by Selva, was enlarged in 1937 as part of the upgrading works directed by the engineer Eugenio Miozzi.
On that same occasion some walls that divided the right side of the foyer into several spaces were demolished to make this side the mirror image, in shape and decoration, of the left.
A commemorative plaque recording the box-holder owner&#x27;s transfer of shares to the Comune di Venezia in 1935 was then placed in the right wing.
It was precisely thanks to this work, which also included restoration, that the foyer and the Sale Apollinee on the upper floor managed to partly withstand the collapse of the floor and the wall against the stairs to the boxes following the fire of 29 January 1996. The opera house entrance is therefore the area in which the largest number of original elements of the building survive: part of the decoration and most of the columns, the floor and the access stairs to the boxes.

===House===

The fire of 1996 completely destroyed the five tiers of boxes, the stage and the ceiling, leaving only the perimeter walls on the original house.

Reconstruction was based on the architect Aldo Rossi&#x27;s design, keeping to the motto &quot;As it was, where it was,&quot; which had been applied to the rebuilding of St Mark&#x27;s bell Campanile, exactly the same as the original and taking ten years, after it collapsed in 1902. The faithful reconstruction of the house was facilitated by the comprehensive treatise on the reconstruction that had been drawn up by the Meduna brothers after the work carried out following the first fire of 1836. Reconstruction of the decorations in the house, in a Rococo style, was based mainly on consultation of the considerable photographic archive on the opera house held in the theatre&#x27;s historic archive.
In order to speed up the work, two procedures were adopted.

Reconstruction of the masonry and wooden framing of the building was carried out in the opera house itself by hundreds of workers employed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while the decorative components were constructed at the same time in various external workshops so that these would be ready for application once the structural work was complete.
The same nineteenth-century materials were used: papier-mache, wood, and plaster for all ornamentation of the royal box and the entrance, the 22 Nereids that are part of the cornice of the so-called soffittone (ceiling), and the four putti in the royal box.
The guiding principle was that of recreating the original house, particularly its specific technical solution based mainly on the use of wood, carefully chosen and treated to obtain the best acoustic response. The big soundbox of the wooden house was enclosed in a protective envelope of masonry and reinforced concrete floors.

The only decorative element built at least partly on site was the ceiling, which reproduces the original design, giving the optical illusion of a vaulted ceiling. It features paintings of several female figures, some of whom are carrying musical instruments, and young maidens representing the Graces, Music, Dance and Aurora. 
The chandelier is a reproduction of the English original in gilt bronze, commissioned by the Meduna brothers from craftsmen in Liverpool in 1854. The arms of the sconces in the boxes were also made following the model of a single surviving example.

The main theme of the house decorations, dating from 1854, is a reproduction of a forest with acanthus leaves depicted in the papier-mache decorations, subsequently enriched with 23-carat gold leaf worked using the quartz technique and polished with agate.
The paintings outside the boxes have cherubs with musical instruments or in playful mood. The first tier also includes the profiles of classical poets, while the second features six allegories representing History, Poetry, Philosophy, Comedy, Tragedy, and Music.

On the third tier are &quot;putti&quot; holding tablets engraved with the titles and authors of 14 of the most important operas staged in the house.

A significant innovation in the appearance of the house was made by a radical change of color inside the individual boxes. The original shade of beige has now been replaced by a blue-green pastel color.

The current access to the stalls was designed by the engineer Miozzi in 1937 and decorated at the sides with two plaster caryatids. The house originally had two small entrances in the section now occupied by the first on the right of the current access, which until the second half of the 1930s was taken up by three boxes in the first tier.

The orchestra pit now has a moveable platform. When the pit is not required, the platform can be raised to the level of the stalls, allowing some rows of additional seats to be added to the front, increasing capacity by 104 to 1,126. The moveable platform, which consists of two elements, can also be completely or partially raised to the level of the stage in order to enlarge it.

The curtain was reproduced on the basis of an examination of historic documentation, in dark-green, deep nap, fire-resistant synthetic velvet decorated with 1,100 flowers in gilt leather.

The new stage is accompanied by a second lateral stage onto which the stage equipment now moves sideways for construction and handling of the scenery.

===Royal box===

The place of honor in the house has a tormented existence, relating not only to the history of the opera house but also to the political and historic events of the city of Venice.

The royal box was not part of Giannantonio Selva&#x27;s original plan for La Fenice; at the time of its construction the house contained only boxes of the same size.
Venice had lost its independence in May 1797 to the First French Empire, which then handed the city over to the Austro-Hungarian empire for eight years following the Treaty of Campoformio in 1797, and in 1805 Venice once again came under French rule. The first imperial loggia was built only provisionally in 1807 to accommodate the emperor, Napoleon, who was expected in the opera house on Tuesday 1 December 1807 for a performance of the cantata &quot;Il Giudizio di Giove&quot; by Lauro Corniani Algarotti. Its construction required the demolition of three central boxes in both the second and third tiers.

In 1808 the architect Giannantonio Selva built the definitive model with the assistance of Giuseppe Borsato on the decorations. This was destroyed by the fire that struck La Fenice in December 1836, and was rebuilt along with the rest of the house by the Meduna brothers in 1837, with the assistance of Giuseppe Borsato, who increased the splendor of the decorations.
Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Venice once again found itself under Habsburg rule. At the end of March 1848, following insurrectionary uprising and the Republic of Venice&#x27;s consequent declaration of independence from Austria, the loggia was taken down so that the original tiers of boxes could be reinstated in the so-called &quot;Republican&quot; house. The six boxes that had been in the center of the house until the beginning of the nineteenth century were therefore rebuilt. However, the Imperial Austrian Royal Government then returned, and on 22 August 1849 ordered reconstruction of the loggia in its original form. The decorations were entrusted once again to Giuseppe Borsato who, now over 70, remade them to a richer design than before. This was his last work; his box was presented in January 1850 in the presence of his widow Maria Bonadei Borsato.
The imperial loggia finally became the royal box in 1866 with the Veneto entrance into the Kingdom of Italy.

The symbol of the Italian royal family can still be seen inside the box, reproduced on the side walls. There was a third Savoy shield on the crown of the external cornice, but this was removed after the republican victory in the referendum of 2 June 1946 and replaced with the lion of St Mark, the symbol of Venice.
There are some ivory-painted wooden putti in the corners of the walls on four gilt, wooden candelabra. On the papier mache-decorated wooden ceiling there is a reproduction of the painting &quot;Apotheosis of the Sciences and the Arts&quot;, originally by the painter Leonardo Gavagnin.
The royal box also offers its guests the use of a private room, which has its own private entrance.

===Sale Apollinee===

The Sale Apollinee, so named because dedicated to the Greek god Apollo, father of the Muses and patron of the Arts, including music, consists of five rooms whose current layout dates from 1937.
These rooms are now used during the intervals by the audience occupying the first three tiers of boxes and the stalls. The five rooms of the Sale Apollinee were originally used even when there was no show in the opera house; its bar would be open during the day and there was a billiard table in one of the rooms.

On the top of the main door is a symbol of the sun, a tribute to the King of France Louis XIV. The Apollon room was thought of as a ballet room; ballet came to prominence in part because of Louis XIV&#x27;s interest in it. He performed a series of dances in Ballet Royal de la Nuit, in the final piece as Apollo in a costume with a kilt of golden rays—and thus became known as the Sun King. La Fenice was built in tribute to the god Apollo.

Unlike the house, which was completely destroyed by the enormous fire of 1996, about a fifth of these rooms survived. The surviving fragments can be easily recognized, as the precise intention of the reconstruction work was that it highlight the difference between the historic sections and the recent additions. The original parts of the ceiling cornices and remaining ornamental stuccoes on the walls are darker in color, in testimony of the last fire. The same difference can be seen in the marble frames of some of the doors, repaired with new marble of a different color, and in the new flooring, which merges with the typical Venetian terrazzo that remained in the room dedicated to the famous singer Maria Malibran.

Thanks to these completions, the Sale Apollinee has been rebuilt on the basis of the originals, though a wider range of choice was conceded than in the house, shown by the new upholstery and furnishings in these rooms.

====Sala Dante====
The main bar is in the Sala Dante, named after the frescoes that once decorated its walls.

This room was inaugurated in 1865 on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the birth of Dante Alighieri. To celebrate the event, the painter Giacomo Casa created a large composition within the decorative ceiling frame, showing Italy in the act of crowning the great poet and six tempera fresco paintings on the walls, with the same number of scenes from the Divine Comedy. Two of these were then replaced in 1867 with others in tempera by Antonio Ermolao Paoletti.

In September 1976 the walls and ceiling of this room, renamed the Sala Guidi, were decorated with works by the Venetian painter Virgilio Guidi, which covered the scenes from Dante. The fire of 1996, however, destroyed these canvases, bringing back to light some fragments of the original decoration by Casa, which have now been completed with a sinopia to assist their reading.

====Sala Grande====

The Sala Grande or ballroom is he main room of the five Sale Apollinee, lit by the three windows in the middle of the entrance façade.

Used over the years for different purposes, the Sala Grande was an elegant venue for balls, chamber music concerts, conferences or book launches, and (before La Fenice was provided with special rooms for them) rehearsals. It was also used by the governing board in 1935.
Almost completely destroyed on the night of 29 January 1996, the Sala Grande has been faithfully reconstructed to the original model.

The floor, which is above the foyer, collapsed after the fire and only the corners were saved. The current floor has been faithfully rebuilt to the original model and its characteristic floral patterns reproduced, requiring the use of various types of wood: maple, olive, and cherry. The color of the walls is also the same as the original. A gallery runs around the circumference of the upper part of the room, with access from the three doors on the top floor.

==New rooms==
&quot;As it was, where it was&quot;, the motto for reconstruction of La Fenice, called for the opera house to be rebuilt as it was before the 1996 fire.
This principle, however, was seen applying only to the rooms of particular historic and artistic importance.
The opportunity was therefore taken to redesign the parts of the building that did not come into this category, resulting in the creation of three new rooms.

==In fiction==

Donna Leon&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Death at La Fenice&quot; (1992), the first in her Commissario (Detective) Guido Brunetti detective series, centers on a mystery surrounding the sensational death by cyanide poisoning of a famous orchestra conductor, in the midst of a production of &quot;La traviata&quot; at La Fenice. In several scenes the opera house is described in meticulous detail, as it was at the time of writing, previous to the third fire.

<text>Rinkitink in Oz is the tenth book in the Oz series written by L. Frank Baum. It was published on June 20, 1916, with full-color and black-and-white illustrations by artist John R. Neill. It is notable that most of the action takes place outside of Oz, and no character from Oz appears in the novel until its climax; this is due to Baum&#x27;s having originally written most of the book as a fantasy novel unrelated to his Oz books over ten years earlier, in 1905. It was followed by &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; (1917).

==Plot summary==
Prince Inga is the son of King Kitticut and Queen Garee, who rule the island kingdom of Pingaree. Kitticut tells Inga that years earlier, when armies from the neighboring islands of Regos and Coregos attempted to invade and conquer Pingaree, they were repelled by Kitticut himself with the aid of three magic pearls. The blue pearl gives its bearer superhuman strength, the pink pearl protects him from any harm, and the white pearl speaks words of wisdom.

The jovial fat King Rinkitink of Gilgad arrives in Pingaree on royal holiday, and remains as Kitticut&#x27;s guest for several weeks. Rinkitink usually rides Bilbil, a surly talking goat. One day invaders from Regos and Coregos arrive again, and seize King Kitticut before he can reach his magic pearls. All the people are carried into slavery, except Inga and Rinkitink who escape along with Bilbil. Inga resolves to free his people with the aid of the magic pearls. Keeping the pearls secret from Rinkitink, he hides them in his shoes, and the three sail to Regos.

The wicked King Gos of Regos and his army are easily defeated by the strength and invulnerability of Inga, and they flee to the neighboring island of Coregos, ruled by the equally wicked Queen Cor. Inga and Rinkitink sleep in the palace, but the next morning both shoes along with the pink and blue pearls they contain are accidentally lost. The shoes are found by a poor charcoal burner, who takes them home to give to his daughter Zella. Queen Cor arrives on Regos and captures the now powerless Inga and Rinkitink, and brings them back to Coregos.

Zella, wearing the shoes but unaware of the power they convey, travels to the palace on Coregos to sell honey to Queen Cor. Inga sees her and, recognizing her shoes, trades shoes with her. Again possessing the pearls, he overpowers Cor who escapes and flees to Regos. Inga frees the enslaved people of Pingaree, who sail back home. However his parents are still captives of Gos and Cor, who take them to the neighboring country of the subterranean Nomes, and pay the Nome King Kaliko to use his magic to keep them captive.

Inga, Rinkitink and Bilbil arrive in the Nome Kingdom. For safety, Rinkitink carries the pink pearl which confers invulnerability. The Nome King refuses to release Inga&#x27;s parents because of his promise to Cor and Gos, although he claims to bear no animosity toward the travelers. Rinkitink and Inga sleep in the Nome King&#x27;s palace that night, but in the morning Kaliko attempts to kill both of them by various devious traps. Both escape by means of the power of the pearls they carry.

In Oz, Dorothy learns of these events and travels to the Nome Kingdom with the Wizard of Oz to confront Kaliko. She forces him to release Inga&#x27;s parents. Reunited with Inga, they all travel to Oz. The Wizard discovers that Bilbil is actually Prince Bobo of Boboland who has been turned into a goat by a cruel magician. He and Glinda are able to restore him to human form, which also cures his disagreeable disposition.

Inga, his parents, Rinkitink, and Bobo return to the rebuilt island of Pingaree. Soon afterwards, a boat arrives from Gilgad to take Rinkitink back home. Rinkitink objects that he does not want to return to his royal duties, but eventually is persuaded to return, accompanied by his friend Prince Bobo.

==Reissues==

In 1939, &quot;Rinkitink in Oz&quot; was one of six Oz books specially reissued by Rand McNally in a condensed, small-format &quot;junior edition&quot; for young readers, as a promotion for the MGM film of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

According to &quot;A Brief Guide to Oz&quot;, a &quot;brief racial insult — a tottenhot is a lesser form of man - has been excised from some later editions.&quot;

<text>The Piano Quintet in E-flat major, Op. 44, by Robert Schumann was composed in 1842 and received its first public performance the following year. Noted for its &quot;extroverted, exuberant&quot; character, Schumann&#x27;s piano quintet is considered one of his finest compositions and a major work of nineteenth-century chamber music. Composed for piano and string quartet, the work revolutionized the instrumentation and musical character of the piano quintet and established it as a quintessentially Romantic genre.

The autograph manuscript of the work is preserved in the Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Bonn.

== Composition and performance ==
Schumann composed his piano quintet in just a few weeks in September and October 1842, in the course of his so-called Year of Chamber Music. Before 1842 Schumann had completed no chamber music at all, with the exception of an early piano quartet composed in 1829. Following his marriage to Clara in 1840, Schumann turned to the composition of songs, chamber music and orchestral works. During his year-long concentration in 1842 upon chamber music he executed the three string quartets, Op. 41, the piano quintet, Op. 44; the piano quartet, Op. 47; and the &quot;Phantasiestücke&quot; for piano trio, Op. 88. Schumann&#x27;s work in that year was buoyant in character; John Daverio considers the Piano Quintet to be the &quot;creative double&quot; of the Piano Quartet that was written few weeks later, both displaying the &quot;extroverted, exuberant side of the composer&#x27;s creative genius&quot;.

Schumann had begun his career primarily as a composer for the keyboard; after his detour into writing for string quartet, according to Joan Chisell, the &quot;reunion with the piano&quot; which the piano quintet provoked gave &quot;his creative imagination ... a new lease on life.&quot;

Schumann dedicated the piano quintet to his wife Clara. She was due to perform the piano part in the first private performance of the quintet on the 6th December 1842 at the home of Henriette Voigt and her husband Carl. However she fell ill and Felix Mendelssohn stepped in, sight-reading the &quot;fiendish&quot; piano part. Mendelssohn&#x27;s suggestions to Schumann after this performance led to revisions to the inner movements, including the addition to the third movement of a second trio.

Clara Schumann did play the piano part at the quintet&#x27;s first public performance, which took place on the 8th January 1843 at the Leipzig Gewandhaus. Clara pronounced the work &quot;splendid, full of vigor and freshness.&quot; She often performed the quintet throughout her life. A notable performance came in 1852, when Schumann asked that the younger pianist Julius Tausch replace Clara in the quintet, explaining that &quot;a man understands that better.&quot;

== Instrumentation and genre ==

Schumann&#x27;s piano quintet is scored for piano and string quartet (two violins, viola, and cello).

Schumann&#x27;s pairing the piano with an ordinary string quartet reflected the changing technical capabilities of the piano and the cultural importance of the quartet. By 1842, the string quartet had come to be regarded as the most significant and prestigious of the chamber music ensembles, while advances in the design of the piano had increased its power and dynamic range. Bringing the piano and string quartet together, Schumann&#x27;s quintet exploits fully the expressive capacity of these forces in combination, alternating conversational passages between the five instruments with concerto-like sections in which the combined forces of the strings are massed against the piano. At a time when chamber music was moving out of the salon and into public concert halls, Schumann reimagined the piano quintet as a musical genre &quot;suspended between private and public spheres&quot; according to Daverio, alternating between &quot;quasi-symphonic and more properly chamber-like elements.&quot;

==Influences of Beethoven and Schubert on the piano quintet==

Tovey remarks the formal influence which Beethoven exerted over the quintet. He argues that the final movement&#x27;s lengthy coda is a typically Beethovenian device, and likens the quintet in this respect to the ninth and fourteenth string quartets. He writes that the scherzo so much reflects his style that it &quot;might almost have come from Beethoven.&quot;

Daverio has argued that the quintet was influenced by Schubert&#x27;s Piano Trio No. 2 in E-flat major, a work Schumann had studied and performed intensively over several months in 1828-1829 and which he greatly admired, describing it as Schubert&#x27;s &quot;immortal trio.&quot; Both works are in the key of E-flat, feature a funeral march in the second movement, and conclude with finales dramatically resurrecting earlier thematic material, a composition technique called cyclic form.

== Analysis ==

The piece has four movements in the standard fast-slow-scherzo-fast pattern:
=== I. Allegro brillante ===
The first movement&#x27;s is marked Allegro brillante. This movement exposes much material which reappears later in the work. It sets in contrast exuberant material reflecting Schumann&#x27;s brilliant, wild side, as described by Schumann in the character of Florestan, with slower, &#x27;Eusebian&#x27; sections of great passion.

The movement&#x27;s energetic main theme opens in minims, and characterized by wide, upward-leaping intervals. Tovey writes of the theme that its use of upward leaps is so striking that &quot;it is impossible for the violoncello to throw in a casual leap of an octave in minims without implying the first theme&quot;. The contrasting second theme, marked &quot;dolce&quot;, is reached after a transitional section marked by glances at remoter flat keys. It is presented as a duet between cello and viola, and its &quot;meltingly romantic&quot; character is typical of Schumann&#x27;s ardent inspiration in this quintet.

The central development consists largely of virtuoso figuration in the piano, based on a diminution of the third and fourth bars of the opening theme, which modulates between two vigorous statements of the latter in A-flat and F minor. The figuration is transposed down a tone more or less exactly on its second appearance to lead back to the tonic key. After a standard recapitulation of the main themes a short, energetic coda rounds off the movement. In overall form the opening Allegro is tightly organised, but a deviation from the Beethovenian model. Tovey writes: &quot;he is writing an altogether new type of sonata-work; a kind that stands to the classical sonata somewhat as a very beautiful and elaborate mosaic stands to a landscape-picture.&quot;

=== II. In modo d&#x27;una marcia. Un poco largamente ===
The main theme (A) of this movement is a funeral march in C minor. It alternates with two contrasting episodes, one a lyrical theme (B) carried by the first violin and cello, the second (C), &quot;Agitato&quot;, carried by the piano with string accompaniment, which is a transformation of the principal theme disguised by changes in rhythm and tempo. The whole forms a seven-part rondo:

: A (C minor)
: B (C major)
: A (C minor)
: C (variant of A, F minor)
: A′ (C minor)
: B′ (F major)
: A (C minor)

The transition between funeral march and &quot;Agitato&quot; episode reuses in the piano and violin the descending octaves appearing at the end of the first movement&#x27;s exposition (see figure). This is one of several moments in the quintet where Schumann creates unity across movements by subtly reintroducing thematic material. Theme A, the funeral march, is varied upon its return after the &quot;Agitato&quot; section with rapid triplets in the piano and counterpoint reminiscent of the previous episode in first violin and cello, while the second appearance of B in F major also is with an enriched piano accompaniment.

=== III. Scherzo: Molto vivace ===
The main section of this lively movement is built almost entirely on ascending and descending scales. There are two trios. Trio I, in G-flat major, is a lyrical canon for violin and viola. Trio II, added at the suggestion of Mendelssohn, is a heavily accented &quot;moto perpetuo&quot; whose meter and restlessly modulating, mostly minor tonality are in sharp contrast to the and relative stability of the rest. Since Mendelssohn mentioned that this section wasn&#x27;t &quot;lively&quot; enough, Schumann rewrote it with a flurry of sixteenth notes making it very demanding for the strings, particularly the cello. After the third and final appearance of the scherzo, a brief coda based on the scales concludes the movement, slipping in a recall of Trio I in the final bars.

=== IV. Allegro ma non troppo ===

The finale begins in G minor, on a C-minor chord, rather than in the tonic. The movement as a whole is cast in an unusual form that partly reflects, but ultimately triumphs over Schumann&#x27;s frequent difficulties with the conventional sonata form in his larger-scale instrumental movements. The original handling of both form and key contrasts sharply with the largely conventional formal organization of the previous three movements.

A summary of the main themes and key areas follows:

: m. 1: G minor theme A1
: m. 21: E-flat major theme A2
: m. 29: D minor A1
: m. 37: B-flat major A2
: m. 43: G major theme B (with an important motive B′, first introduced by the viola in 54), B itself is a diminished version of A2.
: m. 77: B minor-major A1
: m. 114: E major-G-sharp minor theme C (accompanied by B′)

: m. 136: G-sharp minor A1
: m. 148: D-sharp minor A1
: m. 156: B major A2
: m. 164: B-flat minor A1
: m. 172: G-flat major A2
: m. 178: E-flat major B recapitulated

: m. 212: G minor A1
: m. 224: E-flat major theme D 
: m. 248: Fugato on A1
: m. 274: E-flat major C (B’) recapitulated
: m. 319: E-flat major, fugato on A1 combined with the opening theme of the first movement, &quot;Allegro brillante&quot;
: m. 378: E-flat major D recapitulated
: m. 402: Coda

The main themes, A1, A2, B and C, are all introduced in the first 135 bars, making this opening roughly equivalent to a sonata exposition. The tonic key, however, is almost entirely absent, with the music mostly remaining in G minor/major until the introduction of the lyrical theme C in the remote key of E major at m. 114. The music modulates to G-sharp minor to begin what is essentially a recapitulation in m. 136, with B returning in E-flat to finally establish the true tonic in m. 178, very late in a lengthy movement.

More than 200 bars remain to unfold, however, almost entirely in the tonic. During their course, Schumann introduces yet another theme, the syncopated D, gets around to recapitulating the lyrical theme C in the tonic, and develops the music further via two fugato passages, the second unexpectedly and impressively incorporating the principal theme of the opening Allegro brillante and combining it with the opening theme A1, finally heard in the tonic.

This coup may have been inspired by a similar confluence of themes in Mendelssohn&#x27;s E flat quartet op. 12. It also, probably deliberately, evokes the climactic contrapuntal finales of works such as Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Jupiter Symphony&quot;. The movement as a whole can be noted for the rondo-like reappearances of the opening theme A1, which consistently avoids the tonic key until the final fugato; for its innovative key scheme, which combines the restless modulations of a traditional sonata development with the idea of recapitulation in the tonic; and for its successful integration of counterpoint within a non-contrapuntal formal structure.

== Reception and influence ==

Schumann&#x27;s piano quintet was widely acclaimed and much imitated. Its success firmly established the piano quintet as a significant, and quintessentially Romantic, chamber music genre. The Piano Quintet in F minor, Op. 34 of Johannes Brahms, reworked from an earlier sonata for two pianos (itself a reworking of an earlier string quintet) at the urging of Clara Schumann, was one of a number of later piano quintets that show Schumann&#x27;s influence and adopt his choice of instrumentation.

Schumann&#x27;s Piano Quintet failed to please at least one discriminating listener: Franz Liszt heard the piece performed at Schumann&#x27;s home in 1848 and described it as &quot;somewhat too Leipzigerisch,&quot; a reference to the conservative music of composers from Leipzig, especially Felix Mendelssohn. Schumann took enormous offense at this remark, especially because Mendelssohn, who was a great friend of Schumann&#x27;s and whom Schumann somewhat idolised, had died only a year earlier. By some accounts Schumann rushed at Liszt and seized him by the shoulders. Liszt eventually apologised. Schumann did not forget Liszt&#x27;s offhanded insult, and mentioned it several times in letters to Liszt. Liszt&#x27;s relationship with the Schumanns was never entirely mended.

== Use in later art and music ==
The funeral march theme of the second movement is prominently used as the main theme of the film &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; by Ingmar Bergman, and is played on violin by Rutger Hauer&#x27;s character Lothos while Buffy kills the vampire portrayed by Paul Reubens in the 1992 feature &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. It is also featured prominently on the all-classical soundtrack of the noted 1934 horror film &quot;The Black Cat&quot;. It is used several times in Yorgos Lanthimos&#x27; 2018 period piece &quot;The Favourite&quot;.

<doc id="377950" wikidata="Q1416277" url="?curid=377950" title="Lords Commissioners">
<text>The Lords Commissioners are privy counsellors appointed by the monarch of the United Kingdom to exercise, on his or her behalf, certain functions relating to Parliament which would otherwise require the monarch&#x27;s attendance at the Palace of Westminster. These include the opening and prorogation of Parliament, the confirmation of a newly elected Speaker of the House of Commons and the granting of royal assent. The Lords Commissioners are collectively known as the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission includes at least three—and usually five—Lords Commissioners. In current practice, the Lords Commissioners usually include the Lord Chancellor, the Archbishop of Canterbury (who is named but usually does not participate), the leaders of the three major parties in the House of Lords, the convenor of the House of Lords Crossbenchers and (since 2007) the Lord Speaker. Occasionally there are substitutions (such as deputy party leaders) if the normal commissioners are unavailable.

The Lord Chancellor serves as the most senior Lord Commissioner after the Archbishop of Canterbury, who in modern times never participates in the Commission. Traditionally the Lord Chancellor took part in the ceremony and presided over the Royal Commission. However, since the 2007 appointment of Jack Straw, a member of the House of Commons, as Lord Chancellor the person in that office does not participate in Royal Commissions, much like the Archbishop of Canterbury. In this case, the Leader of the House of Lords performs the duties of the Lord Chancellor, with the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords serving as a Lord Commissioner. Exceptions to this procedure were seen in 2009 and 2019, when royal approbation was declared to the elections of John Bercow and Lindsay Hoyle as Commons speaker. On these occasions the lord chancellor, respectively Jack Straw and Robert Buckland, performed this function personally and the Lord Speaker did not serve as a Lord Commissioner.

The Lords Commissioners enter the chamber of the House of Lords at the appointed time, and take seats on a structure temporarily placed for the duration of the ceremony. The Lord Chancellor or Leader of the House of Lords, as the most senior Lord Commissioner, commands the gentleman/lady usher of the Black Rod to summon the House of Commons. Representatives of the House of Commons arrive at the Bar of the House of Lords, and bow thrice, but do not actually enter the Lords Chamber. After each bow, male Lords Commissioners doff their hats to the members of Parliament while female Lords Commissioners bow their heads in return. The reading clerk of the House of Lords then reads the Monarch&#x27;s Commission, which authorises the Lords Commissioners. After the appropriate business has been transacted, the Commons again bow thrice and depart.

<text>A piano quartet is a chamber music composition for piano and three other instruments, or a musical ensemble comprising such instruments. Those other instruments are usually a string trio consisting of a violin, viola and cello.

Piano quartets for that standard lineup were written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Robert Schumann, Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Gabriel Fauré among others. In the 20th century, composers have also written for more varied groups, with Anton Webern&#x27;s &quot;Quartet&quot;, opus 22 (1930), for example, being for piano, violin, clarinet and tenor saxophone, and Paul Hindemith&#x27;s quartet (1938) as well as Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Quatuor pour la fin du temps&quot; (1940) both for piano, violin, cello and clarinet. An early example of this can be found in Franz Berwald&#x27;s quartet for piano, horn, clarinet and bassoon from 1819, his opus 1.

A rare form of piano quartets consist of two pianos with two players at each piano. This type of ensemble is informally referred to as &quot;eight-hand piano&quot;, or &quot;two piano eight hands&quot;. Eight-hand piano was popular in the late 19th century before the advent of recordings as it was a mechanism to reproduce and study symphonic works. Music lovers could hear the major symphonic works all in the convenience of a parlour or music hall that had two pianos and four pianists. Many of the popular works of Mozart, Schumann, Brahms and Dvořák were transcribed for two piano eight hands. The majority of 8 hand piano music consists of transcriptions, or arrangements.

<text>A national academy is an organizational body, usually operating with state financial support and approval, that co-ordinates scholarly research activities and standards for academic disciplines, and serve as public policy advisors, research institutes, think tanks, and public administration consultants for governments or on issues of public importance, most frequently in the sciences but also in the humanities. Typically the country&#x27;s learned societies in individual disciplines will liaise with or be coordinated by the national academy. National academies play an important organisational role in academic exchanges and collaborations between countries.

The extent of official recognition of national academies varies between countries. In some cases they are explicitly or de facto an arm of government; in others, as in the United Kingdom, they are voluntary, non-profit bodies with which the government has agreed to negotiate, and which may receive government financial support while retaining substantial independence. In some countries, a single academy covers all disciplines. In others, there are several academies, which work together more or less closely; for example, France, where the groups five self-governing Academies, or Australia. In many states, they are organized in academies of science. In the countries of the former Soviet Union, and in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the national academies have considerable power over policy and personnel in their areas. There is, however, a growing consensus among international federations of learned academies that bona fide national (or learned) academies need to adhere to certain criteria:
* The fellowship is elected, on the basis of excellence, by existing fellows (members)
* The number of fellows is restricted either to a total number or to a rate of accretion
* The governance of the academy is democratic and &quot;bottom up&quot;. The fellowship is the ultimate source of the academy&#x27;s authority
* The academy is independent of government, industry and professional associations. Most, if not all, academies derive some financial support from some or all of these other organisations but this support needs to be given in a manner that does not compromise the academy&#x27;s independence.

==United States==
In 1863, President of the United States Abraham Lincoln incorporated the United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). The affiliated organizations were granted congressional charters to operate under the National Academy of Sciences. In 1916 President Woodrow Wilson reincorporated the organization under the National Research Council to foster scientific research emphasizing American industries. Today NASEM is composed of three non-profit member organizations: the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) (after 2015; formerly Institute of Medicine (IoM)). The U.S. national academies also serve as public policy advisors, research institutes, think tanks, and public administration consultants on issues of public importance or on request by the government.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom four national academies are the major learned societies of England: the Academy of Medical Sciences, British Academy, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society. In addition, there are the Learned Society of Wales in Wales and the Royal Society of Edinburgh in Scotland. The UK Young Academy is for young scientists.

== Japan ==
In Japan, all of the national academies were established during the early years of the Showa Era. The two premier national academies in the country are the Science Council of Japan and The Japan Academy. Representing the artistic profession and literature is the Japan Art Academy.

The Science Council of Japan (SCJ) was founded by American physicist Harry C. Kelly in 1949 during the Allied occupation of Japan as a special organisation under the Prime Minister&#x27;s jurisdiction, operating independently from the Government of Japan to promoting and enhancing scientific research in the country. The SCJ represents all Japanese scientists, researchers and engineers from multiple fields from the natural sciences to the humanities, making necessary policy recommendations relating to science and technology to the national government. The SCJ has 210 Council Members stipulated by a mandated quota as well as 2,000 Associate Members nationwide.

<doc id="377975" wikidata="Q407821" url="?curid=377975" title="Lead(II) sulfate">
<text>Lead(II) sulfate (PbSO4) is a white solid, which appears white in microcrystalline form. It is also known as &quot;fast white&quot;, &quot;milk white&quot;, &quot;sulfuric acid lead salt&quot; or &quot;anglesite&quot;.

It is often seen in the plates/electrodes of car batteries, as it is formed when the battery is discharged (when the battery is recharged, then the lead sulfate is transformed back to metallic lead and sulfuric acid on the negative terminal or lead dioxide and sulfuric acid on the positive terminal). Lead sulfate is poorly soluble in water.

==Structure==
Anglesite (lead(II) sulfate, ) adopts the same orthorhombic crystal structure as celestite (strontium sulfate, ) and barite (barium sulfate, ). All three minerals&#x27; structures are in the space group &quot;Pbnm&quot; (number 62). Each lead(II) ion is surrounded by 12 oxygen atoms from 7 sulfate ions, forming a PbO12 polyhedron. The lead–oxygen distances range from 2.612 Å to 3.267 Å and the average distance is 2.865 Å.

==Manufacturing==
Lead(II) sulfate is prepared by treating lead oxide, hydroxide or carbonate with warm sulfuric acid or by treating a soluble lead salt with sulfuric acid.

Alternatively, it can be made by the interaction of solutions of lead nitrate and sodium sulfate.

==Toxicology==
Lead sulfate is toxic by inhalation, ingestion and skin contact. It is a cumulative poison, and repeated exposure may lead to anemia, kidney damage, eyesight damage or damage to the central nervous system (especially in children). It is also corrosive - contact with the eyes can lead to severe irritation or burns. Typical threshold limit value is 0.15 mg/m3.

==Mineral==
The naturally occurring mineral anglesite, PbSO4, occurs as an oxidation product of primary lead sulfide ore,

==Basic and hydrogen lead sulfates==
A number of lead basic sulfates are known: PbSO4·PbO; PbSO4·2PbO; PbSO4·3PbO; PbSO4·4PbO. They are used in manufacturing of active paste for lead–acid batteries. A related mineral is leadhillite, 2PbCO3·PbSO4·Pb(OH)2.

At high concentration of sulfuric acid (&gt;80%), lead hydrogensulfate, Pb(HSO4)2, forms.

==Chemical properties==
Lead(II) sulfate can be dissolved in concentrated HNO3, HCl, H2SO4 producing acidic salts or complex compounds, and in concentrated alkali giving soluble tetrahydroxidoplumbate(II) [Pb(OH)4]2− complexes.


Lead(II) sulfate decomposes when heated above 1000 °C:

<text>The Dassault Mirage F1 is a French fighter and attack aircraft designed and manufactured by Dassault Aviation. It was developed as a successor to the Mirage III family.

During the 1960s, Dassault commenced development of what would become the Mirage F1 as a private venture, alongside the larger Mirage F2. Work on the F1 eventually took precedence over the costlier F2, which was cancelled during the late 1960s. The French Air Force (&quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;) took interest in the fledgling fighter to meet its requirement for an all-weather interceptor aircraft. Accordingly, initial production units were equipped with the Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV monopulse radar. During the latter half of 1974, the Mirage F1 entered service in the French Air Force. Shortly thereafter, the type was deployed as the main interceptor of the French Air Force, a capacity which it continued to serve in until the arrival of the Mirage 2000. It later transitioned to an aerial reconnaissance role. In July 2014, the last French Mirage F1s were retired from service.

Powered by a single SNECMA Atar 9K-50 turbojet engine, which provided about of thrust, and armed with an array of French and American-sourced armaments, the Mirage F1 has been operated as a light multipurpose fighter and has been exported to around a dozen nations. The type has seen action in a large number of armed conflicts involving several of its operators, including the Western Sahara War, the Paquisha War, the Cenepa War, the Iran–Iraq War, the Gulf War, the South African Border War, the War in Afghanistan, the Chadian–Libyan conflict, the 2011 military intervention in Libya, and the Northern Mali conflict. Although sources differ, and no official record exists, somewhere in the region of 726 Mirage F1s of all variants and trainers were manufactured during its run between 1966 and 1992. It was succeeded in production by the Dassault Mirage 2000.

==Development==

The Mirage F1 emerged from a series of design studies performed by French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation. Having originally sought to develop a larger swept wing derivative of the Mirage III, which became the Mirage F2, to serve as a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) propulsion testbed akin to the Dassault Mirage IIIV, however, it was soon recognized that the emerging design could function as the basis for a competent fighter as well. Both the Mirage F2 and a smaller derivative, referred to the Mirage F3, received substantial attention from both Dassault and the French Air Force, the latter being interested in its adoption as a long-range fighter bomber as a stopgap measure prior to the adoption of the envisioned Anglo-French Variable Geometry (AFVG) strike aircraft.

Parallel with the Mirage F3 study, which was intended to serve as an interceptor aircraft, Dassault decided to study a single-seat derivative which featured the all-French SNECMA Atar 9K-50 turbojet engine. As a result of the cancellation of two major projects, the company&#x27;s design team found themselves with a decreased workload. Accordingly, in mid-1964, Dassault decided to commence design work on the smaller aircraft, subsequently designated as the &quot;Mirage F1&quot;, with the intention of producing a successor to its Mirage III and Mirage 5 fighters; This work was performed under a government contract in anticipation of a potential French Air Force specification for an all-weather interceptor to succeed its fleet of Mirage IIIC aircraft.
The Mirage F1 was of similar size to the delta-winged Mirage III and Mirage 5, and was powered by the same SNECMA Atar engine as had been used on the larger Dassault Mirage IV; however, unlike its predecessors, it shared the layout of a swept wing mounted high on the fuselage and a conventional tail surface as used by the F2. Although it has a smaller wingspan than the Mirage III, the Mirage F1 nevertheless proved to be superior to its predecessor, carrying more fuel while possessing a shorter take-off run and superior maneuverability.

On 23 December 1966, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight. The first flight had been delayed due to a funding shortage affecting the overall program. During its fourth flight, the prototype was recorded as having attained a top speed in excess of Mach 2. On 18 May 1967, the first prototype was lost in an accident at DGA Essais en vol, Istres; the crash had resulted from a loss of control after encountering flutter, killing its pilot. Despite this misfortune, during late 1966, the Mirage F1 programme was officially adopted by the French Air Force. Following a redesign period, on 20 March 1967, the second prototype performed its first flight.

On 26 May 1967, an order for three Mirage F1 prototypes was placed, while the larger and more expensive Mirage F2 was formally abandoned. These three pre-service aircraft, along with a static structural test airframe, soon joined the test programme. By late 1971, the construction of an initial batch of 85 production standard Mirage F1 had been authorised.

In order to comply with the French Air Force&#x27;s requirement for an all-weather interceptor, the first production &quot;Mirage F1C&quot; was equipped with a Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV radar system. The later Cyrano IV-1 version added a limited look-down capability. However, Mirage F1 pilots reported that the radar was prone to overheating, which reduced its efficiency. During May 1973, the first deliveries to the French Air Force took place; the type entered squadron service with EC 2/30 &quot;Normandie-Niemen&quot; in December of that year.

By October 1971, the Mirage F1 was under production at both Dassault&#x27;s Bordeaux facility and at SABCA&#x27;s own plant in Belgium, work at the latter having been performed under an industrial arrangement associated to Belgium&#x27;s order for 106 Mirage 5 aircraft. The 79 aircraft of the next production run were delivered during the period March 1977 to December 1983. These were of the &quot;Mirage F1C-200&quot; version, which featured a fixed refuelling probe, which required an extension of the fuselage by 7 cm.

==Design==
The Dassault Mirage F1 was a single-engine fighter aircraft, designed to function as both an interceptor aircraft and a ground attack platform. While officially developed for the French Air Force as an air defense aircraft, Dassault had placed considerable emphasis on developing the Mirage F1 for ground attack duties as a secondary role during its early design. Developed by the company to function as a successor to the successful Mirage III and Mirage 5 families, it drew heavily upon its predecessors as well, sharing the same fuselage as the Mirage III, while adopting a considerably different wing configuration.

The Mirage F1 used a shoulder-mounted swept wing, instead of the Delta wing of the Mirage III, which resulted in a more than 50% reduction in required runway lengths and increased internal fuel tankage for 40% greater combat range. The approach speed prior to landing is 25% less than the preceding Mirage IIIE. According to Dassault, the negative performance impact associated with the increased thickness of the Mirage F1&#x27;s wing over the Mirage III&#x27;s counterpart had been offset by improvements made to the propulsion system. The wing is fitted with both double-slotted trailing edge flaps and full-span leading edge slats, the latter being automatically operated to reduce the aircraft&#x27;s turn radius during combat.

A key area of advancement on the Mirage F1 over its predecessors was in its onboard avionics. The Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV monopulse radar system, developed from the Cyrano II unit installed on the Mirage IIIE, serves as the main sensor; it operates in three different modes: air-target acquisition and tracking, ground mapping, and terrain avoidance. The later Cyrano IV-1 model also provided for a limited look-down capability. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the Cyrano IV radar was capable of detecting aerial targets at double the range of earlier models. The standard production Mirage F1 was furnished with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), radar altimeter, UHF/VHF radio sets, Tactical Air Navigation system (TACAN) and a ground data link. Other avionics include an autopilot and yaw damper.

The Mirage F1 was powered by a single SNECMA Atar 9K-50 turbojet engine, which was capable of providing roughly of thrust, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of 1,453 MPH and an altitude ceiling of 65,615 feet. Flight International described the Atar engine as being &quot;unexpectedly simple&quot;, despite the adoption of an afterburner. An improved engine, initially known as the &quot;Super Atar&quot; and later as the Snecma M53, was intended to be eventually adopted on production Mirage F1 aircraft, as well as for successor aircraft.

The initial armament of the Mirage F1 was a pair of internal 30 mm cannons, and a single Matra R530 medium-range air-to-air missile, which was carried under the fuselage. It could carry a total combined payload of 6300kg of bombs and missiles, all of which would be carried externally. After 1979, the medium-range R530 was replaced by the improved Matra Super 530 F missile as the latter came into service in quantity with the French Air Force. In 1977, the R550 Magic was released, which the Mirage F1 mounted on wingtip rails. Around the same time, the American AIM-9 Sidewinder was also introduced to the Mirage F1&#x27;s armament; both the Spanish and Hellenic Air Forces had requested the integration of the Sidewinder upon their own Mirage F1CE and Mirage F1CG fighters.

==Operational history==

===France===
During 1984, the first operational deployment to be performed by French Air Force Mirage F1s was conducted during Operation Manta, the French intervention in Chad to counteract the growing Libyan encroachment in the region. A force of four Mirage F1C-200s provided air cover for a further group of four Jaguar strike aircraft; they also participated in a number of skirmishes against pro-Libyan Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) rebels.
In 1986, French Mirage F1s were redeployed to Chad as part of Operation Epervier. A flight of four F1C-200s provided fighter cover for a strike package of eight Jaguars during the air raid against the Libyan airbase at Ouadi Doum, on 16 February. A pair of F1CRs also conducted pre and post-strike reconnaissance missions.

In response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, France performed two deployments of Mirage F1s to the Persian Gulf. In October 1990, 12 Mirage F1Cs were dispatched to Doha, Qatar in order to boost air defences, while a further four Mirage F1CRs of ER 33 were deployed to Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Daguet in September 1990. To avoid the risk of being mistaken for hostile Iraqi Mirage F1s, all of the French F1CRs were grounded during the first few days of the Allied air attacks, flying their first combat mission on 26 January 1991; an additional reason for their initial grounding was the lack of compatible night vision equipment. They were used in the fighter bomber role, using their more capable navigation systems to lead formations of French Jaguar fighter bombers, as well as to fly reconnaissance missions; in this capacity, 114 sorties had been flown by the end of hostilities. Following the end of the Gulf War, France deployed a number of Mirage F1CRs to bases in neighbouring Turkey as part of Operation Provide Comfort to protect Kurds from Iraqi aggression.
In October 2007, three Mirage 2000s and three Mirage F1s were deployed at Kandahar Air Force Base, where they flew close air support and tactical reconnaissance missions in support of international forces in Southern Afghanistan.

The last French unit to be equipped with the Mirage F1 was the Escadron de Reconnaissance 2/33 &quot;Savoie&quot;, home-based at Mont-de-Marsan, which flew the latest version of the F1CR. The unit&#x27;s primary mission was tactical reconnaissance, with a secondary mission of ground-attack; because of the unique missions of the 2/33, their unofficial motto among the pilots had become, &quot;Find; Identify; and Photograph or Destroy.&quot; In accordance with a bilateral defense agreement between France and Chad, a pair of 2/33 F1CRs, along with 3 pilots, a photo interpreter, an intelligence officer and ground crews were always deployed to N&#x27;Djamena, Chad. The two 2/33 F1CRs operated with three Mirage 2000Ds, also based on rotation from France to Chad.

During March 2011, 2/33 Mirage F1CRs were deployed to Solenzara Air Base, Corsica and conducted reconnaissance missions over Libya (also a Mirage F1 operator) as part of Opération Harmattan. In 2013 2/33 F1CRs also participated in Operation Serval in Mali. On 10 January, launching from their base in N&#x27;Djamena in Chad, the first French air intervention mission against Islamist rebels in Mali, was undertaken by F1CRs and Mirage 2000Ds, supported by a French Air Force C-135 tanker. The 2/33 F1CRs provided valuable photo information for strike aircraft flying the next day from France. Later on 16 January, two 2/33 F1CRs, were deployed from Chad to Bamako, Mali. Both aircraft were fitted with extra long range 2,200 litre ventral tanks; and when operating over Mali also carried two 250 kg unguided bombs, plus their internal 30mm cannons, in case they were called on for close air support missions.

In order to replace the elderly F1CRs of ER 2/33, a number of Rafales were outfitted with an advanced reconnaissance pod. The Rafale&#x27;s range, maneuverability and combat load is far superior to the F1CR that it replaces, as well as its reconnaissance capabilities: after the Rafale&#x27;s pod has taken photographs, these can be almost instantly transmitted back to its base or where the imagery would be required if provisioned with compatible down link equipment. The French Air Force&#x27;s last Mirage F1 fighters were retired from operational service on 13 June 2014. The last units in service, these being 11 single-seat Mirage F1CRs and three two-seat F1Bs were transferred to storage; six aircraft performed a final appearance in a flypast during Bastille Day celebrations over Paris prior to their disposal.

===Ecuador===
Between 1979 and 1980, Ecuador received 16 F1JAs (a variant of the F1E) and a pair of F1JEs. The Ecuadorian Air Force&#x27;s (FAE) squadron of Mirage F1JAs (&quot;Escuadrón de Caza 2112&quot;) went into action in January–February 1981 during the brief Paquisha War between Ecuador and Peru, less than two years after the aircraft had been delivered to the FAE. At that time, the Ecuadorians decided against directly challenging the Peruvian Air Force (abbreviated FAP), whose Mirage 5Ps and Sukhoi Su-22 were providing air cover to Peruvian heliborne operations within the combat zone. Instead, the Mirages were kept at a distance, performing combat air patrols (CAPs) on the fringes of the combat area, in case the border clashes escalated into wider hostilities. During one incident, a Peruvian Sukhoi Su-22 was intercepted and a single air-to-air R.550 missile was launched; however, it failed to strike the Peruvian aircraft.
In 1995, during the Cenepa War, the Ecuadorian Mirages went back into action against Peru. This time, while the bulk of the squadron was kept back at Taura AFB, a small detachment of Mirage F1s and Kfir C.2s was deployed to undisclosed forward air bases to dissuade Peruvian attack aircraft from entering the combat zone. By this time, the planes had been upgraded with Israeli electronics and Python Mk.III air-to-air missiles, usually mounted on the outer underwing pylons, and Matra R550 Magic AAMs on wing-tip launch rails.

On 10 February 1995, a pair of Mirage F1JAs, piloted by Maj. Raúl Banderas and Capt. Carlos Uzcátegui, were directed over five targets approaching the combat zone in the Cenepa valley. After making visual contact, the Mirages fired their missiles, claiming two Peruvian Su-22Ms shot down, while a Kfir claimed a further A-37B Dragonfly. Sources in Peru, however, deny the claim that the Sukhois Su-22Ms were shot down by Ecuadorian aircraft, stating that one was shot down by Ecuadorian anti-aircraft artillery fire during a low flying ground-attack mission, while the second was lost because of an engine fire. Banderas served as Commander of the Ecuadorian Air Force between May 2014 and February 2016, while Uzcátegui died in a training accident in 2002 at Salinas air base, in the Santa Elena Province.

In 2011, all of the remaining Ecuadorian Mirage F1s still in service were retired after having flown more than 33,000 flight hours during their 32 years in active service; they were replaced by a squadron of Atlas Cheetah fighters bought from South Africa.

===Greece===
Greece operated 40 Dassault Mirage F1CG single-seat fighters. The F1CG was first ordered in 1974 and entered service with the Hellenic Air Force in 1975. The aircraft were used by the 334th All-Weather Squadron and the 342nd All-Weather Squadron. Mirage F1CGs were armed with the AIM-9P missile, rather than the more commonly used R.550 Magic, and could carry four AIM-9Ps, rather than just two. Mirage F1s were used in mock dogfights with the Turkish Air Force over disputed waters and airspace in the Aegean Sea during 1987, and on 18 June 1992, a Greek Mirage F1 crashed while attempting to intercept two Turkish F-16s, another is claimed to have crashed in similar circumstances on 4 September 1995, and on 8 February 1995, a Turkish F-16 crashed after dogfighting Greek F1s. The loss of a Turkish RF-4E (69-7485) on the 20 October 1995 is conformed and often attributed to a dogfight with the Mirage F1. A further claim—that is denied—is the loss of a Mirage on the 7th of November 1994 to a Turkish F-16. The loss of a further RF-4E on 5 November 1997 is recorded and may have been the victim of either an F-16 or a Mirage F1. 

The Hellenic Air Force retired the remaining 27 Mirage F1CGs on 30 June 2003 after 28 years of service and 160,000 flying hours. A number of F1CG aircraft have been preserved, permanently grounded, for display. At least four are preserved in Tanagra Air Base (LGTG) (115, 124, 129 and 140). One more (134) is preserved at the HAF History Department, Delta Falirou.

===Iraq===
Starting in 1977 and continuing through the 1980s, Iraq placed several orders for Mirage F1s. Although the first version, designated as the Mirage F1EQ, was quite similar to the original French Mirage F1C, those developed subsequently were increasingly modified with custom-tailored equipment (notably in the field of electronic warfare), according to the Iraqis&#x27; wishes. During this period, France was a major supplier of military equipment to the nation; in 1983, the former loaned five Super Étendards to Iraq while the latter was awaiting the delivery of the Exocet-capable Mirage F1EQ-5, which wouldn&#x27;t be available until September 1984. The Super Étendard had been strongly advocated for by Dassault, who had feared the potential cancellation of the sizable Mirage F1 order by Iraq if the request was not granted.

From 1983 onwards, Iraqi Mirage F1s were also used for ground attack. In this role, the Mirage F1 was used to replace Iraq&#x27;s aging fleet of Hawker Hunters. In September 1985, an agreement was signed between Dassault and Iraq for the delivery of a further 24 aircraft, consisting of 18 Mirage F1EQ-6 fighters and 6 F1BQ trainers.

During the Iran–Iraq War, Iraq&#x27;s Mirage F1EQs were used intensively for interception, ground attack and anti-shipping missions. The Mirage F1EQ allowed for Iraqi strikes to be conducted over a greater combat radius into Iran than had been previously possible. In November 1981, an Iraqi Mirage F1 accounted for the first Iranian F-14 Tomcat to be shot down, followed by several more in the following months, giving the previously timid Iraqi Air Force new confidence in air-to-air combat engagements with the Iranians. According to research by journalist Tom Cooper, during the war 33 Iraqi Mirage F1s were shot down by Iranian F-14s and two were downed by Iranian F-4 Phantom II units. Iraqi F1EQs claimed at least 35 Iranian aircraft, mostly F-4s and Northrop F-5E Tiger IIs, but also several F-14 Tomcats.

On 14 September 1983, a pair of Turkish Air Force F-100F Super Sabre fighter jets of 182 Filo “Atmaca” penetrated Iraqi airspace. A Mirage F1EQ of the Iraqi Air Force intercepted the flight and fired a Super 530F-1 missile at them. One of the Turkish fighter jets (s/n 56-3903) was shot down and crashed in Zakho valley near the Turkish-Iraqi border. The plane&#x27;s pilots reportedly survived the crash and were returned to Turkey. The incident was not made public by either side, although some details surfaced in later years. The incident was revealed in 2012 by Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz, in response to a parliamentary question by Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) MP Metin Lütfi Baydar in the aftermath of the downing of a Turkish F-4 Phantom II in Syria, in 2012.

On 17 May 1987, an Iraqi Falcon 50 modified with elements of a Mirage F1 fired a pair of Exocet missiles at the United States Navy (USN) warship USS Stark as it patrolled the Persian Gulf, causing extensive damage to the ship, killing 37 and wounding 21 members of Stark&#x27;s crew. The exact motive and orders of the pilot remain unclear, although Iraq later apologized for the attack, referring to the incident as &quot;a mistake&quot; and blaming Iran.

Prior to the outbreak of the 1991 Gulf War, the Mirage F1EQ was the second most numerous type operated by the Iraqi Air Force (the most numerous being the MiG-21). On 17 January 1991, during the opening minutes of the conflict, an unarmed, United States Air Force (USAF) EF-111, crewed by Captain James A. Denton and Captain Brent D. Brandon scored a kill against an Iraqi Mirage F1EQ, which they managed to maneuver into the ground, making it the only F-111 to achieve an aerial victory over another aircraft. Later in the war, an Iraqi Mirage piloted by Capt. Nafie Al-Jubouri successfully downed an American EF-111 Raven through aerial maneuvering as it crashed while attempting to avoid a missile fired by Al-Jubouri.

Coalition forces shot down several Iraqi F1s during the Gulf War, such as six F1EQs that were shot down by USAF F-15 Eagles. A pair of F1EQs, which were preparing to carry out an attack on Saudi oil facilities were shot down by a Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) F-15C. Of a pre-conflict force of 88 Mirage F1EQs, 23 were destroyed in the war, a further six were damaged, 24 were flown to Iran and interned; only 23 aircraft remained in service by the end of the Gulf War. Of the 23 destroyed Iraqi Mirage F1EQs, 9 were claimed to have been destroyed in aerial combat.

===Morocco===

In December 1975, Morocco ordered 25 Mirage F1CH interceptors. In March 1977, an additional contract was signed, stipulating the delivery of five additional Mirage F1CHs, as well as 20 Mirage F1EHs (including six aircraft equipped with in-flight refuelling probes). The first deliveries to the Royal Moroccan Air Force (RMAF) took place in 1978. Moroccan Mirage F1s flew with three squadrons: Assad and Atlas, which were multi-role (interceptor and fighter-bomber) units, and Iguider, a specialised reconnaissance squadron. Comprising over a third of its fighter force, the Mirage F1 served as the primary air defence fighter of the RMAF for the next two decades.

Starting in October 1979, these aircraft were engaged in combat missions against the forces of the Polisario Front, operating in Western Sahara. During their early combat operations, Moroccan Mirage F1s used unguided bombs, rockets, and their internal cannons to attack Polisario targets. In November 1979, the first Moroccan Mirage F1 was shot down by a Polisario 9K31 Strela-1, and its pilot was killed. Another one was shot down by an SA-7 on 6 December, and two more followed in February 1980. With the losses to Polisario air defences mounting, Moroccan pilots started using toss bombing tactics to minimize their exposure to air defences, that had meanwhile been reinforced with 2K12 Kub/SA-6 medium-range SAM systems. Using this technique, in early January 1982, Moroccan Mirages even started attacking SA-6 sites. However, the strikes had very poor results, due to the inaccuracy of this technique. Moreover, the soft sand of the Sahara desert caused a lot of bombs to fail to detonate.

To solve these issues, several measures were taken. The Moroccans started using bombs equipped with daisy cutter fuses, and later South African-made Jupiter airburst fuses. Moroccan Mirages also starting operating in hunter-killer teams, with one aircraft fitted with long-range cameras and/or ESM equipment guiding one or two low-flying Mirage F1s to attack the targets it detected. These tactics proved highly successful, and they became the principal way in which Moroccan Mirages operated for the remainder of the war. Moreover, the aircraft were modified with chaff/flare dispensers. Lastly, ECM pods were bought to increase the aircraft&#x27;s survivability against SA-6s, and the first were delivered in 1983. All this, combined with better training of the Moroccan pilots (including during joint exercises with the French and the Americans), resulted in much improved effectiveness of operations against Polisario forces. In total, over the course of the war in Western Sahara, twelve Mirage F1s were shot down by the POLISARIO. Four pilots were killed, and five were taken prisoner.

On 17 August 2015, a Moroccan Mirage F1 crashed due to a bird strike; its pilot ejected successfully.

===South Africa===

During 1971, South Africa commenced its search for a replacement for the Mirage III; as a result, it chose to purchase a licence to manufacture both the Mirage F1 and its engine with the intention of producing up to 100 Mirage F1s. However, this license was quickly cancelled as a consequence of the impending 1977 arms embargo. The SAAF proceeded to procure 16 Mirage F1CZs and 32 Mirage F1AZs, which were quickly delivered by Dassault prior to the embargo being implemented, the first of these deliveries occurring in 1975.

Both the F1CZ and F1AZ variants of the South African Air Force (SAAF) saw considerable action during operations in the Border War. In November 1978, the first five F1CZs were deployed to South-West Africa (Namibia), tasked with providing escort for reconnaissance flights over Southern Angola. From 1980, such deployments as escort aircraft became regular. Due to teething problems with the F1AZ, F1CZs were initially assigned the strike role in southern Angola using Matra M155 rocket pods or 250 kg bombs.

F1CZs of 3 Squadron downed two Angolan MiG-21s in 1981 and 1982. On 6 November 1981, during Operation Daisy, two F1CZs were vectored by GCI to intercept two MiG-21s heading south. Major Johan Rankin shot down the wingman with cannon fire, as the missiles failed to lock on to the MiGs. On 5 October 1982, while escorting a Canberra of 12 Squadron on a photo-reconnaissance sortie, Rankin and his wingman engaged two MiG-21s on an intercept course. He fired two Magic AAMs at one of the MiGs, damaging the aircraft with the second missile. Rankin then attacked the second MiG and destroyed it with cannon fire. The first MiG was able to return to base, but sustained additional damage making a belly landing.

In May 1982, an Angolan Mi-8 helicopter that the SADF believed to be carrying senior officers was located and destroyed in the Cuvelai area. The helicopter was located with rotors running on the ground by a pair of F1CZs and destroyed by 30mm cannon fire.

Two F1AZs of 1 Squadron were lost over Angola. On 20 February 1988, while flying an interdiction sortie in F1AZ &#x27;245&#x27; against a road convoy during Operation Hooper, Major Ed Every was shot down by an SA-13 Gopher SAM. F1AZ &#x27;223&#x27; was lost almost a month later, on 19 March, when Captain Willie van Coppenhagen flew into the ground while returning from a diversionary strike at night. A SAAF Board of Inquiry was unable to determine the causes of the crash.
Two F1AZs and a F1CZ were also damaged by enemy action, but were able to return to base. On 7 June 1980, while attacking SWAPO&#x27;s Tobias Haneko Training Camp during Operation Sceptic (Smokeshell), Major Frans Pretorius and Captain IC du Plessis were both hit by SA-3 Goa SAMs. The aircraft piloted by Du Plessis was hit in a fuel line and he had to perform a deadstick landing at AFB Ondangwa. Pretorius&#x27;s aircraft sustained heavier damage and had to divert to Ruacana forward airstrip, where he landed with only the main undercarriage extended. Both aircraft were repaired and returned to service. During the last phase of the Bush war 683 combat sorties were flown by the F1AZs, and more than 100 SAMs were fired at them.

On 27 September 1987, during Operation Moduler, an attempt was mounted to intercept two Cuban FAR MiG-23MLs. Captain Arthur Piercy&#x27;s F1CZ was damaged by either an AA-7 Apex or AA-8 Aphid AAM fired head-on by Major Alberto Ley Rivas. The explosion destroyed the aircraft&#x27;s drag chute and damaged the hydraulics. Piercy was able to recover to AFB Rundu, but the aircraft overshot the runway. The impact with the rough terrain caused Piercy&#x27;s ejection seat to fire; he failed to separate from the seat and suffered major spinal injuries.

In February 1987, three F1AZs fired several V-3B missiles at a group of MiG-23s without success. This was repeated again in February 1988 when a F1AZ fired a missile at a MiG-23 and fired its 30mm cannon, again without success. Various other unsuccessful attempts were made during the 1987–88 period.

Apart from operations from Namibia in July 1981, a pilot of the Mozambican Air Force defected with his MiG-17. He flew from his base near Maputo towards South Africa. Two F1AZs returning from a training exercise intercepted the MiG-17. In March 1981 two F1AZs intercepted a Zimbabwean Army CASA C-212 and forced it to land in South Africa after asserting that the aircraft had strayed into South African airspace.

The SAAF lost an additional six F1AZs and three F1CZs to various mishaps. F1CZ &#x27;205&#x27; caught fire after landing and was repaired using the tail section of F1CZ &#x27;206&#x27; (Piercy&#x27;s aircraft).

===Spain===

In June 1975, with tension growing with Morocco, Spain decided to strengthen its Air Force and bought 15 Mirage F1C that were allocated to Albacete AB. In mid-1976 there was still some tension with Morocco and Algerian and Libyan MiG-25 flights on the Mediterranean, which would lead the Spanish Air Force to purchase ten more Mirage F1C and two years later order 48 Mirage F1C and F1E.

Some years later Spain also bought 12 F1EDA/DDA&#x27;s retired from Qatar Air Force, which donated some equipment and weapons used by those Mirage F1s. In Spanish service the F1CE was known as the C.14A, the F1EE was the C.14B and the two-seater F1EDA as the C.14C.

They served mainly as Spain&#x27;s primary air defence interceptors and interdiction as secondary role until they were superseded by Spain&#x27;s EF-18A Hornets. They served with Ala 11 (11th Wing) in Manises (Ex-Qatari planes), Ala 14 in Albacete, and Ala 46 at Gando in the Canary Islands. Ala 46 used their Mirage F1s mainly as air defence planes, using same deep blue color pattern as French planes.

In October 1996, Thomson-CSF was awarded a FFr700 million (US$96m) contract to upgrade 48 F1C/E single-seaters and 4 F1EDA trainers to Mirage F1M standard (see below). Ex-Qatar Mirage F1s were left outside the upgrade, as it was a different version, and were the first ones to be retired. As well as a service-life extension, this improved the avionics and added anti-shipping capability with a modernised Cyrano IVM radar and Exocet compatibility.

From July 2006 to November 2006, Spanish Mirage F1s were deployed to Lithuania as a part of NATO&#x27;s Baltic Air Policing mission; during this deployment, they were scrambled twice to intercept undisclosed intruders. On 20 January 2009, a pair of Spanish F1s from the 14th Wing crashed near their base during a routine Spanish Air Force dogfight training mission, resulting in the deaths of all three crew members. The wreckage of the two jets, including the remains of the aircrew, was found about apart. By 2009, there were 38 F1M&#x27;s in service with Escuadrón 141 (141st Squadron) &quot;Patanes&quot; and Escuadrón 142 (142nd Squadron) &quot;Tigres&quot; of Ala 14.

In 2013, the Spanish Air Force retired its fleet of Mirage F1s, having progressively phased the type out of service as increasing numbers of the Eurofighter Typhoon had become available. During 2013, it was reported that Spain may sell sixteen F1M&#x27;s to Argentina but it seems they now have the budget to buy new Kfirs instead. The deal went through and Argentina bought the Spanish Mirages in October 2013, but the deal was scrapped in March 2014 after pressure from the United Kingdom on Spain to not assist in FAA modernization over tensions between the countries over the Falkland Islands. In November 2017, Draken International announced that it had acquired 22 F1Ms from Spain and would refurbish and upgrade them for use as adversary aircraft.

===Libya===
Libya procured 16 Mirage F1ED interceptors, 6 F1BD two-seaters, and 16 Mirage F1ADs to equip the Libyan Air Force. The F1AD model is a specialized strike variant that lacks the standard radar unit; it is instead outfitted with a retractable fuel probe mounted on the nose. Four F1ADs were subsequently upgraded into a multirole configuration.
Throughout the day of 18 August 1981, a total of 70 Libyan aircraft, including Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23s, MiG-25s, Sukhoi Su-22s, Su-22Ms and Mirage F1s, approached a US Navy carrier battle group as a show of strength. They were escorted until their withdrawal from its vicinity by McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs and Grumman F-14 Tomcats.

Even though they weren&#x27;t involved continuously, Libyan Mirage F1s participated in the war in Chad intensively and proved their worth during the Libyan campaigns through the 1980s. From 1981, a detachment was deployed at Marten es-Serra in southern Libya. Both the F1AD and F1ED versions were used in this war. Even though the Mirage F1ED was designed foremost as an interceptor, it was mainly used for ground attack purposes like the F1AD, although some combat air patrols were flown as well. When operating in Chad, the Mirage F1AD&#x27;s typical combat configuration consisted of a pair of 1.300 litre drop tanks and a pair of Belouga CBUs. Operations were performed almost exclusively during daylight hours and from high altitudes, which resulted in limited effectiveness. Together with Mirage 5s, MiG-23s, and Sukhoi Su-22s, Mirage F1s were instrumental in the success enjoyed during different campaigns against the Chadian troops in the early 1980s: operating over the open and barren desert terrain, they caused heavy damage, for no Mirage F1 losses in exchange.

Both Libyan Mirage F1 squadrons were staffed by some of the best pilots and officers in the Air Force, and the Libyans put extra care in the maintenance of these aircraft. Indeed, US Navy pilots involved in the 1981 encounters with Libyan fighters concluded that the Mirage F1 pilots were markedly superior to those flying Soviet-made aircraft.

The Mirage F1 fleet saw action during the 2011 Libyan Civil War. The Libyan Air Force posed little threat to coalition forces, partially as a result of insufficient equipment and a heavy reliance upon older aircraft acquired from the Soviet Union, but remained effective against poorly armed anti-Gaddafi rebels. On 21 February 2011, a pair of Libyan aircraft landed in Malta after they had been ordered to bomb protesters in Benghazi; both of the pilots claimed political asylum. Following the death of Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the civil war, France and Libya formed an agreement in 2012 to modernise the remaining Mirage F1 fleet, as well as covering the potential purchase of additional Mirage F1s that had been formerly operated by the French Air Force.

==Variants==

===Mirage F1A===

Single-seat ground-attack fighter aircraft, with limited daylight-only air-to-air capability. Fitted with lightweight EMD AIDA 2 ranging radar instead of Cyrano IV of other variants, with laser rangefinder under nose, retractible refuelling probe and more fuel.
* Mirage F1AD : Mirage F1A for Libya. 16 delivered 1978–1979.
* Mirage F1AZ : F1A for South Africa. 32 delivered 1975–1976.

===Mirage F1B===

The French Air Force also ordered 20 Mirage F1Bs, a two-seat operational conversion trainer; these were delivered between October 1980 and March 1983. The extra seat and controls added only 30 cm (12 in) to the length of the fuselage, but at the cost of less internal fuel capacity and the loss of the internal cannons.

The empty weight increased by 200 kg (440 lb), partly due to the addition of two Martin-Baker Mk 10 zero-zero ejection seats, in place of the Mk 4 used in the F1C, which had a forward speed limitation.

In all other aspects the F1B is a combat-capable aircraft and it can compensate for lost capacity with cannon pods and drop tanks.
* Mirage F1BD : Export version of the Mirage F1D for Libya. Six delivered 1978–1979.

===Mirage F1CR===

When it became clear that the Mirage F1 was becoming a successful production aircraft, Dassault began investigating the possibility of a dedicated reconnaissance version for its most important client, the French Air Force. However, the escalating cost of fighter aircraft meant that add-on pods for this purpose were a more economical alternative.

Many French Air Force aircraft, as well as those of some export clients (such as Iraq&#x27;s Mirage F1EQ), did indeed have a variety of reconnaissance pods available, which were attached to the underside of the main fuselage. However, the development of a tactical reconnaissance aircraft for the French Air Force continued, and the first Mirage F1CR flew on 20 November 1981.

The Mirage F1CR carries reconnaissance equipment, internally and externally:
* A SAT SCM2400 Super Cyclope infrared linescan unit is installed in the space previously occupied by the port cannon.
* A space under the nose can be used for a Thomson-TRT 40 panoramic camera or a Thomson-TRT 33 vertical camera.
* The Cyrano IVM-R radar has extra ground- and contour-mapping modules.
* A variety of sensors can be carried in external pods carried under the fuselage centreline. These include the &quot;Raphaël TH&quot; Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR), the &quot;ASTAC&quot; ELINT pod and the RP35P optical reconnaissance pod.

A total of 64 Mirage F1CRs were ordered by the French Air Force. The first air force unit equipped with the CR was &quot;Escadron de Reconnaissance&quot; 2/33 which became operational in September 1983.

===Mirage F1CT===

The Mirage F1CT is a ground attack version of the Mirage F1C-200. Following their replacement in the air defence role by the Mirage 2000, the French Air Force had a number of surplus Mirage F1C-200s, and in 1988 it launched a conversion programme to turn these aircraft into interim ground attack aircraft to replace elderly Mirage IIIEs and Mirage 5s. The Mirage F1CT program brought the avionics of the F1C up to the standard of the F1CR, with the radar upgraded with the additional air-to-ground modes of the Cyrano IVM-R, an improved navigation/attack system fitted, with a laser rangefinder fitted under the nose. It was fitted with new Mk 10 ejection seats, while improved radar detection and warning devices, chaff/flare dispensers, and secure radios were also added. It gained the ability to carry a variety of air-to-ground weapons, including rockets, cluster bombs and laser-guided bombs, while retaining the F1C&#x27;s air-to-air armament.

Two prototypes were converted by Dassault, the first flying on 3 May 1991, with a further 55 converted by the workshops of the French Air Force at Clermont Ferrand by 1995.

===Mirage F1AZ and F1CZ===

The South African Air Force (SAAF) flew both the Mirage F1AZ ground-attack version as well as the radar-equipped Mirage F1CZ fighter. The first two examples of the first order (48 aircraft, comprising 32 F1AZ and 16 F1CZ) were delivered on 5 April 1975. In July of that year, the remainder of the F1CZs were delivered and 3 Squadron was recommissioned to operate the aircraft from AFB Waterkloof. In 1975 the F1CZs also appeared at a South African airshow, the public were not informed that it was already in service.

The F1AZ was developed in conjunction with Dassault and the SAAF as a dedicated ground attack variant. The F1AZs were delivered between November 1975 and October 1976 and were assigned to 1 Squadron. Paramount Group, a South African-based company owns the intellectual property for the Mirage F1AZ.

The F1AZ has a laser-based rangefinder, permitting the highly accurate fusing and aiming of unguided munitions, such as bombs and rockets. Optical design was by the Optics (later ELOPTRO) division of Armscor in South Africa. 
The F1AZ features an integrated ground-attack system, comprising two on-board computers that can identify targets at a distance of 5 km. A laser range finder, situated below its conical nose, is connected to the computers to provide them with target info without emitting radar signals. After target identification and information gathering, bombs are automatically released at the right moment, known as CCRP, or &#x27;Computer Controlled Release Point&#x27;. While the range-finding ability of the EMD AIDA 2 radar permits the use of combat and visual interception missiles, the helmet-mounted sight element enables the pilot to make off-boresight engagements, without waiting until achieving an optimum firing position. The F1AZ is equipped with two internal DEFA 30mm cannons with 125 rounds each, and carries a wide variety of external ordnance, including various types of bombs, cluster munitions, missiles, and rocket launchers.

The SAAF retired the F1CZs in 1992, followed by the F1AZs in 1997.

Despite their retirement in 1997, the accuracy of the F1AZ&#x27;s armament delivery is still considered classified information by the SAAF; analysis by informed news services (e.g., &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot;) and pilot reports (e.g., Commandant Dick Lord, &#x27;Vlamgat&#x27;, 1999) conclude that the F1AZ has accuracies within the order disclosed by the USAF for their F-15E Strike Eagle in unguided ballistic mode.

In 2004, up to 21 F1AZs were reported in storage at AFB Hoedspruit, awaiting a possible buyer. In April 2006, it was reported that Aerosud had purchased the surviving Mirage F1AZs and spares.

South Africa granted Aerosud a contract to fit the Dassault Mirage F1 with the Klimov RD-33 engine used in the MiG-29 fighter. Although overtaken by the decision of the South African Air Force to buy the SAAB JAS 39 Gripen, the upgrade was technically successful.

On 17 August 2006, French news agency &quot;Agence France-Presse&quot; (AFP) reported that two upgraded ex-South African F1AZs had taken part in a fly-past over Libreville earlier that day in celebration of Gabon&#x27;s independence day. The refurbishment and upgrade of the aircraft was carried out by Aerosud. Aerosud Group managing director Dr. Paul Potgieter confirmed his company&#x27;s involvement, but declined to give numbers or cite figures.

===Mirage F1 M53===
Developed for the participation in the &quot;European&quot; NATO fighter competition of early seventies, seeking to replace the F-104G. It was equipped with a more powerful engine, the SNECMA M53, and other improvements. Failed to succeed, the contest was eventually won by the General Dynamics F-16. The Mirage F1 came in second place

===Mirage F1M===
The F1M upgrade (unrelated to the M-53 prototype) was applied to 48 Spanish F1CE/EE and four F1EDA trainers under a FFr700 million (US$96m) contract awarded to Thomson-CSF in October 1996. The prototype F1M flew in April 1998, and CASA delivered the remainder between March 1999 and 15 March 2001. The project included a revised cockpit with colour LCDs and a Smart HUD from Sextant Avionique, a Sextant inertial navigation system with GPS interface; NATO-compatible Have Quick 2 secure communications; Mode 4 digital IFF; a defensive aids suite; and flight recorders. The radar was upgraded to Cyrano IVM standard, adding sea search and air to ground ranging modes.

===Mirage F1 MF2000===
The Royal Moroccan Air Force started in 2005 the 350 million euro MF2000 upgrade program to modernise 27 F1CH, F1EH and F1EH-200 aircraft. Changes included replacement of the old Cyrano IV radar by a RC400 (RDY-3) radar based on that used by the Mirage 2000-5, a revised cockpit, and improved armament, with Damocles targeting pods, MICA air-to-air missiles and AASM guided bombs added. This upgrade was performed by ASTRAC (Association Sagem Thales pour la Rénovation d&#x27;Avions de Combat).

==Operators==
The Dassault Mirage F1 has been operated by fourteen air forces, with five of them still doing so. Out of these, three have been European, five Middle Eastern (with one still flying the type), and five African (four still operating it).

===Current operators===
* Congolese Air Force two Mirage F1s in service as of December 2021.
* Gabonese Air Force six Mirage F1s in service as of December 2021.

* Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force seized 24 F1BQs and F1EQs flown over from Iraq, during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. As of December 2021, 12 Mirage F1EQs and 5 Mirage F1BQs were in service.
* Libyan Air Force received 16 F1AD, 6 F1BD and 16 F1ED aircraft. All were grounded but twelve were contracted for refurbishment, of which only four were returned to service. Of these twelve, two were taken to Malta when their pilots defected. France will renovate Libya&#x27;s small fleet of Mirage F1s and train its personnel as part of a defence co-operation agreement signed in 2012. Three Mirage F1 were reported lost during the western 2019 offensive.
* Royal Moroccan Air Force received 30 F1CHs, 14 F1EHs and 6 F1EH-200s. 23 are still operational and 27 have been upgraded to ASTRAC standards.

===Non-government/private military operators===
* Paramount Aerospace Systems acquired four former French Air Force Mirage F1B.
* Draken International has acquired 20 former Spanish Air Force Mirage F1Ms and 2 F1B aircraft for use in the Adversary Air role providing support to the United States Air Force. One plane was lost when it crashed on May 24, 2021.
* Textron subsidiary Airborne Tactical Advantage Company in 2017 acquired 63 former French Air Force Mirage F1B, F1CT, and F1CR for dissimilar air combat training and aggressor squadron purposes for the US Air Force. The intention is to have between 30 and 45 of them airworthy.
**On 10 February 2022, an F1 crashed in an unpopulated area near Buckeye around west of Phoenix, Arizona, after the pilot ejected. The aircraft was operating from Luke Air Force Base, supporting the 56th Operations Group.

===Former operators===

* Ecuadorian Air Force operated 16 F1JA &amp; 2 F1JE. During their operational service, at least three of these aircraft were confirmed as lost in accidents. In February 2011, the remaining aircraft in the squadron were retired from service.
* French Air Force received 246 aircraft. The last squadron flying the aircraft was officially disbanded on 13 June 2014.
* Hellenic Air Force operated 40 F1CG.
* Iraqi Air Force received 106 F1EQ &amp; 15 F1BQ between 31 January 1981 and 1989, with a further 4 EQs and 4 trainers undelivered due to Iraq&#x27;s inability to pay and the UN arms embargo imposed following the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In early 2011, the French government offered to update and refurbish 18 French-held Mirage F1s and sell these to the Iraqi Air Force.
* Royal Jordanian Air Force received 17 F1CJ, 17 F1EJ &amp; 2 F1BJ. In 2010 it was reported that Argentina might lease twelve F1CJs and an F1BJ but nothing came of it.
* Kuwait Air Force operated 2 Mirage F1BK, 4 Mirage F1BK-2, 18 Mirage F1CK, and 9 Mirage F1CK-2. These 33 Mirage F1s were delivered between 1976 and 1977.
* Libyan Air Force (1951–2011). Passed on to the successor government.
* Qatar Air Force ordered 12 F1EDA &amp; 2 F1DDA in 1979, which were delivered to Qatar between March 1983 and July 1984. A further F1DDA was supplied later as an attrition replacement. 13 aircraft were sold to Spain.
* South African Air Force operated 32 F1AZ &amp; 16 F1CZ.
* Spanish Air Force received originally 45 F1CE, 22 F1EE &amp; 6 F1BE. Also acquired 24 second-hand examples from France and Qatar in the early 1990s. Spanish F1s were deployed in 2006 for the Baltic Air Policing mission. Finally, Spain decommissioned its Mirage F1 fleet in February 2013.

In 2017, Aaj Tak was criticised for propagating a false claim that a fatwa allowed Saudi Arabian men to eat their wives. That same year, Aaj Tak also came under criticism for propagating a false claim that the Indian army had retaliated against Pakistan following attacks against Indian personnel in Kashmir.

In October 2020, Aaj Tak was fined ₹1 lakh and asked to broadcast apologies for fake news regarding Sushant Singh Rajput. The channel published fabricated last tweets by the actor on the channel, claiming that they were made by him a few days before his death and then deleted. Aaj Tak later removed its article with this fake news published in it.

Aaj Tak was fined ₹5 lakh by BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) for viewership manipulation in a TRP scam.

Between 4 and 5 April 2020, Aaj Tak had broadcast reports about Tablighi Jamaat. A complaint was filed with the News Broadcasting and Digital Standards Authority (NBDSA) in which Aaj Tak was accused of intending to &quot;develop hatred in the minds of the people against a particular community,&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic in India.

On 16 June 2021, the NBDSA directed that Aaj Tak&#x27;s broadcasts be taken down from all Internet platforms that linked the COVID-19 outbreak with Tablighi Jamaat in 2020, citing potential &quot;errors in the figures telecast&quot;.

The NBDSA said that the media has &quot;complete freedom to report on the COVID pandemic&quot;, but &quot;such reporting must be done with accuracy, impartiality and neutrality&quot;, and added, &quot; The NBDSA noted that the broadcaster had admitted that there may have been chances that there were some miscalculations as pointed out by the complaint, which was inadvertent, and the broadcaster had no intention to communalise the issue or malign any community.&quot;

In June 2022, the News Broadcasting and Digital Standards Authority said that Aaj Tak&#x27;s taglines on Umar Khalid ‘gave an impression that the accused had already been declared guilty’ and asked the news channel to take down those shows.

In March 2023, Aaj Tak faced widespread social media ridicule after the clip of its coverage went viral, where the channel&#x27;s representatives were seen filming gangster Atiq Ahmed urinating while in transit from Gujarat to Prayagraj under the custody of police.

A report by Bloomberg accused Aaj Tak of being &quot;frequently laudatory of Modi&quot;.
In March 2024, The News Broadcasters &amp; Digital Association (NBDSA) fined Aaj Tak for Sudhir Chaudhary&#x27;s &#x27;tukde tukde&#x27; and &#x27;Khalistani&#x27; remarks, against the former US president Barack Obama and penalised the channel over &#x27;Love Jihad&#x27; shows.

In March 2024, the News Broadcasting and Digital Standards Authority (NBDSA) directed Aaj Tak to remove a fictional video aired during its &#x27;Black and White&#x27; show, which depicted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as a robber. The NBDSA found the video to be in poor taste and stated that it did not align with ethical broadcasting standards. The authority warned the channel to exercise greater caution in future broadcasts to avoid misrepresentation and potential defamation.

While a student at Indiana University, Fogle lost between 1998 and 1999. Having frequented a Subway restaurant as part of his diet plan, he was hired to help advertise the company the following year. Fogle&#x27;s popularity led to his appearances in over 300 commercials during his 15 years with Subway, alongside other media appearances.

Allegations of Fogle having inappropriate relations with minors began in 2007 but did not gain traction until 2015 when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) uncovered that he received child pornography from an associate. Pleading guilty to the child sex tourism and child pornography charges the same year, Fogle was sentenced to 15 years and 8 months in federal prison. He remains incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood, .

==Early life==
Fogle was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on August 23, 1977, to Norman and Adrienne Fogle. He has a younger brother and sister. He was raised in a Jewish home. He had a bar mitzvah while on a trip to Israel, and then was confirmed by his Conservative-Reconstructionist synagogue.

In 1995, Fogle graduated from North Central High School in Indianapolis. He graduated from Indiana University Bloomington in 2000 and then worked briefly in the revenue management department at American Trans Air.

==Career==
===Subway campaign===

Fogle first came to media attention in April 1999, via an article published in the &quot;Indiana Daily Student&quot; written by a former dormmate about Fogle losing by exercising and eating a diet of Subway sandwiches. Subsequently, Fogle was featured in a &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; magazine article, &quot;Stupid Diets ... that Work!&quot; According to the article, Fogle had become obese – at one point weighing – through lack of exercise and eating junk food.

Fogle changed his eating habits upon the switch to eating at Subway, replacing his 10,000-calorie-per-day food consumption with one small turkey sub and one large veggie sub along with some baked potato chips and diet soda, totalling about 2,000 calories. A Chicago-area Subway franchisee took Fogle&#x27;s story to Subway&#x27;s Chicago-based advertising agency.

As a test, the company ran a regional television advertising campaign. The first ad aired on January 1, 2000, introducing Fogle and his story with the following disclaimer: &quot;The Subway diet, combined with a lot of walking, worked for Jared. We&#x27;re not saying this is for everyone. You should check with your doctor before starting any diet program. But it worked for Jared.&quot;

Because the introductory test ads were a success, Fogle subsequently appeared in more television commercials as well as sponsored in-store appearances throughout the United States. He gave talks on the benefits of fitness and healthy eating. Fogle came to be known as The Subway Guy.

In 2002, Fogle was the subject of an episode of &quot;South Park&quot; titled &quot;Jared Has Aides&quot;. Fogle has stated that while the episode had &quot;typical[ly] tasteless humor&quot;, the fact that an entire episode was devoted to him was &quot;very flattering&quot;. He added, &quot;you know you&#x27;ve made it when shows like &quot;South Park&quot; start parodying you&quot;. Fogle also appeared in the 2017 video game &quot;South Park: The Fractured but Whole&quot; as a boss; this occurred after his child pornography conviction.

In February 2008, a Subway campaign called &quot;Tour de Pants&quot; celebrated Fogle maintaining his weight loss for a decade. As part of the campaign, Fogle made an announcement that he would retire his pair of 62-inch (157-centimeter) pants to a museum at the end of the advertising tour. Beginning in 2008, Fogle&#x27;s presence in Subway advertisements decreased due to the company&#x27;s placing a new emphasis on its &quot;$5 Footlong&quot; promotion.

Fogle&#x27;s role in Subway afforded him some other opportunities, such as appearances in WWE in 2009 and 2011. By 2013, Fogle had filmed more than 300 commercials and continued to make appearances and speeches for the company. Subway attributed one third to one half of its growth in sales to Fogle, with revenue having tripled from 1998 to 2011.

Fogle made appearances in the &quot;Sharknado&quot; film series, beginning with &quot;Sharknado 2: The Second One&quot;. He had a cameo appearance in &quot;Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!&quot;, though this was cut from the Syfy Channel broadcast version a week before the premiere when his house was searched by the FBI. He also appeared in Adam Sandler&#x27;s &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;.

=== Jared Foundation ===
In 2004, Fogle established the Jared Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on raising awareness about childhood obesity through educational programs and tools provided to parents, schools, and community organizations.

On April 29, 2015, Russell Taylor, director of the Jared Foundation, was arrested at his Indianapolis home on charges of child exploitation, possession of child pornography, and voyeurism. According to court records, Taylor and his then-wife, Angela Baldwin, sexually molested young girls and installed cameras in their house to film the victims without their knowledge. Fogle severed all ties with Taylor immediately following the arrest. Taylor attempted suicide on May 6, 2015, at the Marion County Jail and was placed on life support. Taylor pleaded guilty to the charges on September 1, 2015, and on December 10, 2015, was sentenced to 27 years in federal prison. The sentence was thrown out in March 2020 when it emerged that Taylor&#x27;s lawyer had failed to challenge three charges that were not supported by the evidence. The judge who originally imposed the sentence, Tanya Walton Pratt, said that this failure tainted the entire plea deal. Prosecutors filed a new indictment for 30 charges of producing and distributing child pornography in April. Taylor filed a petition to plead guilty that May, formally pleading guilty in November 2021. On May 9, 2022 he was sentenced to 27 years in prison, identical to his original sentence. In October 2021 Baldwin was also convicted of child exploitation, and producing and possessing child pornography and sentenced to 33 years in prison.

In August 2015, a &quot;USA Today&quot; article reported that the Jared Foundation had not issued any grants, nor had it given funds for its stated purpose. The article further noted that, on average, the foundation spent $73,000 a year, with the majority of that figure paying the salary of the foundation&#x27;s executive director. More than one-quarter of the funds were unaccounted for per the foundation&#x27;s tax records. Daniel Borochoff, president of the non-profit charity watchdog group CharityWatch, was quoted in the &quot;USA Today&quot; article as saying, &quot;If Jared was really interested in helping children through his foundation, he could have gotten more money. As with a lot of celebrities, the charity appears to be more about image-enhancement than charitable deeds.&quot;

The Secretary of State of Indiana dissolved the organization in February 2012 because it did not pay the required $5 annual reporting fees during the two previous years, despite being requested to do so on multiple occasions.

== Legal history ==

=== Child pornography investigation and arrest ===
In 2007, Fogle came to the attention of state and federal law enforcement agencies after Sarasota, Florida, journalist and radio host Rochelle Herman-Walrond told the Sarasota Police Department he made lewd comments to her about middle school-age girls; she had met Fogle at a local middle school for a health event, as he was in Sarasota for his speaking tour. She made recordings of Fogle&#x27;s remarks and saved text messages between them, and then went to the FBI, where agents asked her to record her conversations with him. Herman-Walrond befriended Fogle and for the next four years surreptitiously recorded her conversations with him as part of an ongoing federal investigation. She recorded him making several remarks about having had sex with underage girls and asking her to install a webcam in her children&#x27;s rooms so he could watch them; ultimately, the FBI could not pursue a case against Fogle using the recordings because they needed more substantive evidence against him.

During the investigation into Russell Taylor&#x27;s child pornography operation, authorities discovered that Taylor had traded sexually explicit photos and videos of children, some as young as six, with Fogle, including images of his own stepdaughters. Taylor, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison, was later named an unindicted co-conspirator in the FBI&#x27;s case against Fogle. &quot;What we found in Russell Taylor&#x27;s home and on his computers led us to Jared Fogle,&quot; said Tim Horty, a spokesman for the United States Department of Justice.

On July 7, 2015, the FBI and Indiana State Police investigators raided Fogle&#x27;s Zionsville, Indiana, residence and arrested him on charges of distribution and receipt of child pornography; computers and other electronic equipment were removed from his home. The same day, a spokesperson for Subway announced that the company and Fogle had mutually agreed to suspend their business relationship; subsequently, Subway removed all references to Fogle from its website.

Following Fogle&#x27;s arrest, the FBI also subpoenaed a series of text messages made in 2008 between Fogle and Subway franchisee Cindy Mills, with whom he was having a sexual relationship at the time. In these messages, Fogle talked about sexually abusing children ranging in age from 9 to 16, told her to sell herself for sex on Craigslist, and asked her to arrange for him to have sex with her 16-year-old cousin. Mills&#x27;s lawyer said that she had alerted Subway&#x27;s corporate management about the text messages, but that they had responded that because Fogle was not a Subway employee, there was no violation. Subway representatives said they had no record of Mills&#x27;s allegations.

=== Plea agreement ===
On August 19, 2015, federal prosecutors announced they had reached a deal with Fogle in which he would plead guilty to their August 15, 2015, indictment containing two counts, one of distribution and receipt of child pornography (Count 1) and one of traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor—specifically, from Indiana to New York City, where he is charged with paying to engage in sexual acts with a minor girlknown by Fogle to be 17 years old at the time (Count 2). In the August 15 indictment, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana included allegations in Count 1 that Fogle: was fully aware of, and approved of, co-conspirator Russell Taylor soliciting 12 minors, as young as 13 years old, to perform sexually explicit conduct, secretly filming the conduct then sharing the video and image files with Fogle; was aware that Taylor had commercially obtained, and shared with Fogle, sexually explicit images of minors as young as six years old; and, knowingly shared the material obtained from Taylor with other parties. The August 15 indictment included allegations in Count 2 that Fogle: offered adult prostitutes a finder&#x27;s fee to find him younger sex partners; sent text messages to these prostitutes in which Fogle also expressed sexual interest in young boys; and, in addition to engaging in sexual acts with the aforementioned 17-year-old girl, he also offered her a finder&#x27;s fee to find him sex partners younger than her.

According to the plea documents filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Fogle faced up to 50 years in prison had he gone to trial, based on potentially serving, consecutively, a maximum of 20 years on Count 1 and a maximum of 30 years on Count 2. As part of the plea dealwhich was not binding on the sentencing judgeprosecutors agreed to seek no more than 12 years 7 months, while Fogle agreed to not seek a sentence of less than five years. Fogle also agreed to pay a total of million (equivalent to $million in ) in restitution$100,000 to each victim (). As a condition of his plea deal, Fogle would be restricted to supervised contact or communication with minors upon approval of his probation officer, while supervised visits with his own children would be allowed only with approval of their mother, Fogle&#x27;s soon-to-be ex-wife Katie McLaughlin. Under the terms of the plea agreement, upon release from prison, Fogle will be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life and undergo treatment for sexual disorders.

Soon after the plea deal was announced, Subway announced via Twitter that it had completely severed ties with Fogle.

On November 19, 2015, Fogle formally pleaded guilty before federal judge Tanya Walton Pratt. In a statement, Fogle apologized for his crimes, saying that he wanted a chance to become a &quot;good, honest person&quot; and &quot;redeem [his] life&quot; after being ensnared in a life of &quot;deception, lies and complete self-centeredness.&quot; According to John Bradford, a forensic psychiatrist who testified for Fogle&#x27;s defense team, Fogle suffered from a compulsive eating disorder for several years before losing weight, and replaced food with a sense of &quot;hypersexuality&quot;, which included &quot;mild&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; pedophilia. That diagnosis was not accepted by experts in the psychiatry field and was criticized by Judge Pratt and on social media. The next day, Liberty Behavioral Health Corporation psychologist Adam Deming suggested that Bradford&#x27;s use of the words &quot;mild&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; had meant to convey that Fogle&#x27;s primary sexual attraction was to early teenagers, but that he had a lesser attraction to younger children.

When Fogle finished his allocution before Judge Pratt, she sentenced him to 15 years and 8 months in prison, over three years more than what prosecutors had sought and three times what Fogle had requested. Pratt stated that the &quot;level of perversion and lawlessness exhibited by Mr. Fogle is extreme.&quot; Fogle must serve a minimum of 13 years before becoming eligible for time off with good behavior. After serving his sentence, he will be on supervised release for the rest of his life. Pratt also fined him $175,000 and ordered him to forfeit $50,000 in assets (a total equivalent to $ in ), in addition to the restitution he agreed to pay to his victims.

Fogle&#x27;s lawyer, Ron Elberger, filed a notice of appeal on December 14, 2015. Fogle is able to appeal the sentence, since it is longer than the maximum sentence recommended by the prosecutors. The appeal brief was due by January 25, 2016, but Fogle asked for and was granted an extension for his appeal after Elberger was diagnosed with cancer. After the appeal was filed, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office responded by opposing any sentence reduction. On June 9, 2016, Fogle&#x27;s sentence was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

===Incarceration===

Fogle&#x27;s lawyers recommended that he serve his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood near Littleton, Colorado; it has a program for sex offenders. Judge Pratt agreed with the recommendations, but she had no authority to determine where Fogle would serve his sentence. On November 21, 2015, Fogle arrived at the Henderson County, Kentucky, Detention Center, where he was held on a temporary basis. Fogle entered Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) custody, going to Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City, on December 15, 2015. Three days later, he was transferred to FCI Englewood. Fogle&#x27;s BOP number is 12919-028. His earliest possible release date is March 24, 2029.

On November 8, 2017, Judge Pratt dismissed a motion filed by Fogle, which had been prepared for him by a fellow inmate, in which he tried to claim that the court in 2015 did not have jurisdiction to convict Fogle because he is a self-declared &quot;sovereign citizen&quot;.

In November 2021, Fogle spoke out from prison for the first time, writing in a letter to the &quot;New York Post&quot; that he &quot;royally screwed up&quot; and that he runs per day and works out regularly while behind bars, claiming to weigh .

===Lawsuits===
In March 2016, the parents of one of Fogle&#x27;s victims, identified only as &quot;Jane Doe&quot;, filed a lawsuit against Fogle for personal injury and emotional distress. Fogle filed a motion arguing that the parents are actually liable for the injuries because the parents fought and abused alcohol in front of the daughter, and that their pending divorce required the victim &quot;to constantly rotate her living arrangements caused &quot;[sic]&quot; unnecessary stress, anxiety, and trauma for Jane Doe.&quot; 

On October 24, 2016, Kathleen McLaughlin&#x27;s lawyers filed suit against Subway in Indiana. The suit alleges that Subway violated McLaughlin&#x27;s privacy and property rights, and caused personal injury to McLaughlin by covering up at least three instances of Fogle&#x27;s illegal behavior that were reported to senior management, including the allegation that Subway&#x27;s senior vice president of marketing hushed up a 2004 incident in which Fogle propositioned a young girl at a promotional event at a Subway franchise in Las Vegas. The lawsuit was dismissed in October 2017, with the judge writing that the court lacked jurisdiction, since their principal business operations were outside Indiana.

===Potential for other criminal charges===
Fogle potentially faced state charges in New York related to Victims 13 and 14. Potential state crimes included statutory rape and/or trafficking persons for sexual reasons. Fogle&#x27;s federal plea deal has no standing regarding state charges, so there would have been no double jeopardy had New York opted to pursue a criminal case. However, New York defense attorney and former assistant district attorney Matthew R. Smalls stated that New York State was unlikely to bring state charges since it would have had to mount a new investigation and get testimony from victims. Smalls believed that a prosecutor in New York &quot;would really be tone deaf&quot; to ask Victims 13 and 14 to tell their stories again, let alone testify before another grand jury. Abby Phillip of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated &quot;As a legal matter, Fogle may never be charged with rape – or legally labeled with having committed that crime.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Fogle&#x27;s first marriage was to Elizabeth Christie. Their marriage lasted from 2001 until their divorce in 2007. In November 2009, Fogle became engaged to Kathleen McLaughlin, a teacher. In January 2010, &quot;People&quot; reported that Fogle had gained back and planned to lose it by way of his Subway weight-loss program for his upcoming wedding. Fogle and McLaughlin married in July 2010 and had two children together: a son (born 2011), and a daughter (born 2013).

In 2013, Fogle had a net worth of $15 million. On August 19, 2015, following Fogle&#x27;s appearance in federal court on charges of sex with minors and child pornography, his wife released a statement through her attorney announcing that she was seeking a divorce. She added that she was focused &quot;exclusively on the well-being of my children&quot; and would have no further comment. Their divorce was finalized on November 16, 2015; Fogle agreed to pay his now ex-wife $7 million. According to court filings, she had traveled out of state before Fogle&#x27;s guilty plea, and opted to stay in an undisclosed location to protect herself and the children from the &quot;media circus&quot; surrounding Fogle&#x27;s crimes.

A three-part documentary film about Fogle and his crimes called &quot;Jared from Subway: Catching a Monster&quot; was broadcast on the ID pay TV network in March 2023.

<doc id="377998" wikidata="Q6886145" url="?curid=377998" title="MoOLIT">
<text>MoOLIT (Motif OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit) is a graphical user interface library and application programming interface (API) created by Unix System Laboratories in an attempt to create a bridge between the two competing look-and-feels for Unix workstations at the time: OPEN LOOK and OSF Motif.

The library provides common GUI features such as boxes, menus, lists, and buttons, but allows choosing which look and feel they wanted at runtime. MoOLIT development was a short-lived project, as the industry was moving towards Motif as the de facto GUI standard, a trend culminating in the COSE initiative in 1993.

MJM Software (a subsidiary of Melillo Consulting, Inc.) licensed the MoOLIT source in 1992 and ported it to Sun, HP, IBM, and DEC platforms. Their &quot;MoOLIT 5.1&quot; product includes full Motif support for the traditional OLIT widgets not implemented in the USL version. This version of MoOLIT adds the Motif look and feel to legacy OPEN LOOK applications.

<doc id="378002" wikidata="Q6895118" url="?curid=378002" title="Mojo Nixon">
<text>Neill Kirby McMillan Jr. (August 2, 1957 – February 7, 2024), known professionally as Mojo Nixon, was an American musician and actor best known for his novelty song &quot;Elvis Is Everywhere&quot;, which was an alternative staple on MTV. His style could generally be defined as psychobilly, a musical genre which blends rockabilly with punk rock. Nixon hosted &quot;The Loon in the Afternoon&quot; radio show on the Outlaw Country channel of Sirius XM.

==Early career==
Neill Kirby McMillan Jr. was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on August 2, 1957. He paired with Skid Roper in the early 1980s in San Diego. Roper mostly provided instrumental backup to Nixon&#x27;s lyrics. Nixon and Roper released their first album in 1985 on Enigma Records, &quot;Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper&quot;. The song &quot;Jesus at McDonald&#x27;s&quot; from that album was the duo&#x27;s first single.

Nixon and Roper&#x27;s third album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Bo-Day-Shus!!!&quot;, featured the song &quot;Elvis Is Everywhere&quot;, a deification of Elvis Presley, which is his best known song (Nixon later declared his personal religious trinity was Presley, Foghorn Leghorn, and Otis Campbell).

Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper were also recorded in San Francisco during these early years by producer Sylvia Massy at CD Presents for the &quot;Rat Music For Rat People&quot; compilation album.

Throughout the late 1980s, Nixon and Roper produced several satirical pieces lampooning contemporary celebrities, such as MTV VJ Martha Quinn, in &quot;Stuffin&#x27; Martha&#x27;s Muffin&quot;, and Rick Astley and Debbie Gibson, in &quot;Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant with My Two-Headed Love Child&quot;. Nixon appeared in several promotional spots for MTV during this period, but the network&#x27;s decision not to air the video for &quot;Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant ...&quot; prompted him to sever ties with the network. Meanwhile, Nixon and Roper also lampooned contemporary American culture and social issues in songs such as &quot;I Hate Banks&quot;, &quot;Burn Down the Malls&quot;, and &quot;The Amazing Bigfoot Diet&quot;.

Nixon and Roper parted ways late in 1989. The following year Nixon recorded a solo album on Enigma Records called &quot;Otis&quot;. On this album, Nixon continued his assault on pop culture, as in the song &quot;Don Henley Must Die&quot;, which caused a fresh round of controversy, even to the point of Nixon&#x27;s record company begging radio stations &quot;not&quot; to play it. (Henley himself was unfazed; on July 31, 1992, at The Hole in the Wall in Austin, Texas, the former Eagle jumped onstage and performed the song with Nixon, causing Nixon to praise Henley as having &quot;balls as big as church bells&quot;, as well as to ask, &quot;Is Debbie Gibson here too?&quot;)

==Later career==
Shortly after &quot;Otis&quot; was released, Enigma Records went bankrupt, which left much of Nixon&#x27;s early catalog in legal limbo. In the 1990s, Nixon released a handful of albums on several labels with a backup band known as the Toadliquors. These later albums included songs such as &quot;You Can&#x27;t Kill Me&quot;, &quot;Orenthal James (Was a Mighty Bad Man)&quot;, and the controversial &quot;Bring Me the Head of David Geffen&quot;, which was ultimately released on a B-side collection due to pressure from album distributors. Also among his later work was &quot;Tie My Pecker to My Leg&quot;, which featured lyrics about bestiality, incest, and coprophilia.

In the mid-1990s, Nixon collaborated on albums with Jello Biafra (&quot;Prairie Home Invasion&quot;), Dave Alvin, and members of the Beat Farmers, including Buddy &quot;Blue&quot; Seigal (&quot;Live in Las Vegas&quot; by the Pleasure Barons). Country Dick Montana of the Beat Farmers, who was a close friend of Nixon&#x27;s, was eulogized on Nixon&#x27;s 1999 album, &quot;The Real Sock Ray Blue&quot;, after his 1995 death onstage of a heart attack.

Nixon retired from the music business in 2004, playing his last live show on March 20 of that year at the Continental Club in Austin, Texas. In later years, he occasionally performed at special events, as he did to support fellow musician Kinky Friedman&#x27;s candidacy for Texas governor.

==Acting==
Nixon made his acting debut as drummer James Van Eaton in the 1989 Jerry Lee Lewis biographical film &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot;. The film starred Dennis Quaid and Winona Ryder, the latter of whom appeared in Nixon&#x27;s video for &quot;Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant with My Two-Headed Love Child&quot;. The B-side to the &quot;Debbie Gibson&quot; song, which was also the subject of a video, was &quot;(619) 239-KING&quot;, a follow-up to &quot;Elvis is Everywhere&quot; in which Nixon, responding to then-active rumors that Presley was still alive, invited the singer to call and leave a message on what was, at the time of release, a legitimate telephone number.

The 1990s also saw Nixon appear in a further five films, including &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993) and &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; (1994).

In 1997, Nixon voiced the character of Sheriff Lester T. Hobbes, a recurring enemy in the computer game &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot;. The game&#x27;s licensed psychobilly soundtrack also features two of his songs. There was even a promotional music video filmed for the game featuring the song.

==DJing and other media==
In the late 1990s, Nixon worked as a radio disc jockey in San Diego (on KGB-FM) and Cincinnati starting his career in 1998 on WLW before moving to WEBN .

In 1998, he had a short run as an advice columnist with &quot;Life Fixin&#x27; with Mojo Nixon&quot;. Only two columns were authored, and both ran in the short-lived &quot;Peterbelly Magazine&quot;. That year he was also the honorary captain of the United States luge team at the 1998 Winter Olympics. In response to this, Nixon invited members of the men&#x27;s doubles squad to work on a song for the Games: &quot;Luge Team U.S.A.&quot;. The song was recorded by Nixon along with members of the Beat Farmers and luger Gordon Sheer playing drums under the band name The Arctic Evel Knievels.

In 2008, he was hosting three shows on Sirius Satellite Radio: &quot;The Loon in the Afternoon&quot; on Outlaw Country (channel 60), the NASCAR-themed &quot;Mojo Nixon&#x27;s Manifold Destiny&quot; on SIRIUSXM NASCAR Radio (channel 90) and the politically themed &quot;Lyin&#x27; Cocksuckers&quot; on Raw Dog Comedy (channel 99). In October 2005, Nixon began appearing on the Sirius Howard 100 channel as the &quot;General Manager&quot;. On November 8, 2016, Nixon did his final &quot;Lying Cocksuckers&quot; show, saying he would be back next year with another show on RawDog Comedy on Sirius/XM. Nixon hosted a weekday program on Steven Van Zandt’s Outlaw Country channel on SiriusXM.

===&quot;Unretired&quot;===
Nixon&#x27;s first comeback was in 2006 when he came out of retirement in support of Kinky Friedman&#x27;s bid to become Governor of Texas. As Nixon said at the time, &quot;If supporting Kinky for governor is what it takes to drag my ass out of retirement, consider my ass dragged.&quot;

In October 2009, he announced his &quot;unretirement&quot; on his website with the release of his album &quot;Whiskey Rebellion&quot;, a collection of previously unreleased tracks he claimed he had found in &quot;an old shoe box full of cassette tapes&quot; under his front porch. To promote the CD, he announced the temporary free downloads of the CD tracks and several of his solo albums (and albums with Skid Roper) on Amazon.com, along with a tour of several Texas locations. In a press release, he stated,
===&quot;The Mojo Manifesto: The Life and Times of Mojo Nixon&quot;===

In 2013, Freedom Records &amp; Films announced that they were producing a documentary film, &quot;The Mojo Manifesto&quot;, to be released in 2014. The film premiered at the 2022 South By Southwest festival.

On February 21, 2023, Freestyle Digital Media announced that it had acquired worldwide rights to the film, slating it for a March 17 release across VOD platforms.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Nixon and his wife, Adaire, have two sons.

===Views===
Nixon was an outspoken supporter of free file sharing of recordings in MP3 and other formats. In July 2000, he publicly declared his support because he said that he was &quot;not an asshole like Metallica.&quot; In October 2009, several of his albums were available free on Amazon.com in MP3 format for a limited time as part of a promotion for his CD &quot;Whiskey Rebellion&quot;.

Nixon was a self-described &quot;libertarian cynicalist anarchist&quot; and supported Barack Obama in 2012. He was also a member of the Church of the SubGenius.

===Death===
Nixon died from a &quot;cardiac event&quot; on February 7, 2024, while aboard the Outlaw Country Cruise (docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico), which he attended as a performer and host; he was 66 years old. Two days later, James Van Eaton, whom he portrayed in &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot;, also died. Among the memorial events held in honor of Nixon was an all-day concert in Austin, Texas in March 2024 during the South by Southwest festival.
