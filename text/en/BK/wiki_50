<text>A drink can (or beverage can) is a metal container with a polymer interior designed to hold a fixed portion of liquid such as carbonated soft drinks, alcoholic drinks, fruit juices, teas, herbal teas, energy drinks, etc. Drink cans exteriors are made of aluminum (75% of worldwide production) or tin-plated steel (25% worldwide production) and the interiors coated with an epoxy resin or polymer. Worldwide production for all drink cans is approximately 370 billion cans per year.

== History ==
The first commercial beer available in cans began in 1935 in Richmond, Virginia. Not long after that, sodas, with their higher acidity and somewhat higher pressures, were available in cans. The key development for storing drinks in cans was the interior liner, typically plastic or sometimes a waxy substance, that helped to keep the product&#x27;s flavor from being ruined by a chemical reaction with the metal. Another major factor for the timing was the repeal of Prohibition in the United States at the end of 1933.

In 1935, the Felinfoel Brewery at Felinfoel in Wales was the first brewery outside the US to commercially can beer. Prior to this time, beer had been available only in barrels or in glass bottles. From this time, lightweight tin cans could be used. Felinfoel was a major supplier to British armed forces abroad in the Second World War. Cans saved a great deal of space and weight for wartime exports compared to glass bottles and did not have to be returned for refilling. These early cans did not have a pull tab, being equipped instead with a crown cork (beer bottle top). From the 18th century until the early 20th century Wales dominated world tinplate production, peaking in the early 1890s when 80% of the world&#x27;s tinplate was produced in south Wales.

Canned drinks were factory-sealed and required a special opener tool in order to consume the contents. Cans were typically formed as cylinders, having a flat top and bottom. They required a can piercer, colloquially known as a &quot;church key&quot;, that latched onto the top rim for leverage; lifting the handle would force the sharp tip through the top of the can, cutting a triangular hole. A smaller second hole was usually punched at the opposite side of the top to admit air while pouring, allowing the liquid to flow freely.
In the mid-1930s, some cans were developed with caps so that they could be opened and poured more like a bottle. These were called &quot;cone tops&quot;, as their tops had a conical taper up to the smaller diameter of the cap. Cone top cans were sealed by the same crimped caps that were put on bottles, and could be opened with the same bottle-opener tool. There were three types of conetops: &quot;high profile&quot;, &quot;low profile&quot;, and &quot;j-spout&quot;. The low profile and j-spout were the earliest, dating from about 1935. The &quot;crowntainer&quot; was a different type of can that was drawn steel with a bottom cap. These were developed by Crown Cork &amp; Seal (now known as Crown Holdings, Inc.), a leading drink packaging and drink can producer. The popularity of canned drinks was slow to catch on, as the metallic taste was difficult to overcome with the interior liner not perfected, especially with more acidic sodas. Cans had two advantages over glass bottles. First for the distributors, flat-top cans were more compact for transportation and storage and weighed less than bottles. Second for consumers, they did not require the deposit typically paid for bottles, as they were discarded after use. Glass-bottle deposits were reimbursed when consumers took the empties back to the store.
In 1959, the recyclable aluminum can was introduced to the market in a 7 oz. size by the Adolph Coors Company.

In 2008, an aluminum version of the crowntainer design was adopted for packaging Coca-Cola&#x27;s Caribou Coffee drink.

== Standard sizes ==

The standard size of drink cans in each country significantly varies, and various standard capacities are used internationally.

=== Africa ===
==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, standard cans are 330 ml (reduced in the early 2000s from the up-until-then ubiquitous 340 ml) and the promotional size is 440 ml. There is also the 500 ml can. A smaller 200 ml can is used for &quot;mixers&quot; such as tonic or soda water. It has a smaller diameter than the other cans. In September 2018, a 300 ml can was introduced as an alternative to the 330 ml can in a continued effort to reduce the amount of sugar consumed in soft drinks.

=== Asia ===
==== China ====
In China, the most common size is 330 ml.

Can dimensions may be cited in metric or imperial units; imperial dimensions for can making are written as inches+sixteenths of an inch (e.g. &quot;202&quot; = 2 inches + 2 sixteenths).

==== Hong Kong ====
In Hong Kong, most cans are 330 ml – in the past they were usually 355 or 350 ml. 200 ml has also become available. Some beers and coffees are, respectively, sold with 500 ml and 250 ml cans.

==== India ====
In India, 250 ml, 300 ml, 330 ml, 350 ml and 500 ml cans are available.

==== Indonesia ====
In Indonesia, 320 ml cans were introduced for domestically produced beer in 2018. Carbonated soft drink cans are typically 330 ml.
==== Japan ====
In Japan, the most common sizes are 350 ml and 500 ml, while larger and smaller cans are also sold.

==== Malaysia (and Singapore) ====
In Malaysia, beer cans are 320 ml. For soft drinks in both Malaysia and Singapore, the most commonly found cans are 300 ml for non-carbonated drinks and 325 ml for carbonated drinks. Larger 330 ml/350 ml cans are limited to imported drinks which usually cost a lot more than local ones.

==== Pakistan ==== 
In Pakistan, the most common sizes are 250 ml and 330 ml, and 200 ml cans are also sold.

==== South Korea ====
In South Korea, 250 ml cans are the most common for soft drinks, but when accompanying take-out food (such as pizza or chicken), a short 245 ml can is standard. Recently, some 355 ml cans which are similar to North American cans are increasingly available, but are limited mostly to Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper, and beer cans are available in 500 ml.

==== Thailand ====
In Thailand, Singha beer uses 320 ml cans for domestic sales and 330 ml cans for exports.

==== West Asia ====
In West Asia, standard cans are 330 ml.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, the standard can is 330 ml, but since the 1990s 250 ml has slowly become common for energy drinks (e.g. redbull), along with 500 ml, often used for beers and sometimes for soft drinks too (particularly in wholesale supply).

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, 440 ml is commonly used for lager and cider.

==== Ireland ====
In Ireland, 330 ml and 440 ml fat cans are used for soft drinks.

==== Austria ====
In Austria, energy drinks are usually sold in sizes of 200 to 330 ml.

=== North America ===
In North America, the standard can size is .

==== United States ====
The United States standard can is high, in diameter at the lid, and in diameter at the widest point of the body. Also available are cans (known as tallboys or, referring to the weight, &quot;pounders&quot;), and .

==== Canada ====
In Canada, the standard size was previously 12 Imperial fluid ounces (341 ml), later redefined and labelled as 341 ml in 1980. This size was commonly used with steel drink cans in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, the US standard 355 ml can size was standardized in the 1980s and 1990s upon the conversion from steel to aluminum. Some drinks, such as Nestea, are sold in 341 ml cans.

==== Mexico ====
In Mexico, the standard size is 355 ml, although smaller 235 ml cans have gained popularity in the late 2010s and early 2020s.

==== Quebec ====
In Quebec, a new standard for carbonated drinks has been added, as some grocery stores now only sell cans of all major carbonated drinks in six-packs of 222 ml cans. Many convenience stores also began selling &quot;slim cans&quot; with a 310 ml capacity in 2015.

=== Oceania ===
==== Australia ====
In Australia, the standard can size for alcoholic and soft drinks is 375 ml. Energy drinks and some soft drinks are served in 250 ml and 500 ml sizes. Some beers are produced in 330 ml and 500 ml cans.

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, the standard can size is 355 ml, although Coca-Cola Amatil changed some of its canned drinks to 330 ml in 2017.

=== South America ===
==== Brazil ====
In Brazil, the standard can size is 350 ml.

==Composition==

Most metal drink cans manufactured in the United States are made of aluminum, whereas in some parts of Europe and Asia approximately 55 percent are made of steel and 45 percent are aluminum alloy. Steel cans often have a top made of aluminum. Beverage containers are made of two different aluminum alloys. The body is made of the 3004 alloy that can be drawn easily and the top is made of the harder 5182 alloy.

In 2001, the Australian Aluminium Council reported that the average Australian-size can weighed approximately . Improved manufacturing techniques had allowed Australian manufacturers to reduce metal requirements from the 1992 average of . In 2011, an empty U.S.-size can weighed approximately , with approximately 34 per pound or 70 per kilogram.

In many parts of the world a deposit can be recovered by turning in empty plastic, glass, and aluminum containers. Scrap metal dealers often purchase aluminum cans in bulk, even when deposits are not offered. Aluminum is one of the most cost-effective materials to recycle. When recycled without other metals being mixed in, the can–lid combination is perfect for producing new stock for the main part of the can—the loss of magnesium during melting is made up for by the high magnesium content of the lid. Also, reducing ores such as bauxite into aluminum requires large amounts of electricity, making recycling cheaper than producing new metal.

Aluminum cans are coated internally to protect the aluminum from oxidizing. Despite this coating, trace amounts of aluminum can be degraded into the liquid, the amount depending on factors such as storage temperature and liquid composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/S0308-81469700236-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/S0048-96970101122-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical compounds used in the internal coating of the can include types of epoxy resin.

== Fabrication process ==
Modern cans are generally produced through a mechanical cold forming process that starts with punching a flat blank from very stiff cold-rolled sheet. This sheet is typically alloy 3104-H19 or 3004-H19, which is aluminum with about 1% manganese and 1% magnesium to give it strength and formability. The flat blank is first formed into a cup about three inches in diameter. This cup is then pushed through a different forming process called &quot;ironing&quot; which forms the can. The bottom of the can is also shaped at this time. The malleable metal deforms into the shape of an open-top can. With the sophisticated technology of the dies and the forming machines, the side of the can is thinner than either the top and bottom areas, where stiffness is required.

Plain lids (known as shells) are stamped from a coil of aluminum, typically alloy 5182-H48, and transferred to another press that converts them to easy-open ends. This press is known as a conversion press which forms an integral rivet button in the lid and scores the opening, while concurrently forming the tabs in another die from a separate strip of aluminum.

== Filling cans ==

Cans are filled before the top is crimped on by seamers. To speed up the production process filling and sealing operations need to be extremely precise. The filling head centers the can using gas pressure, purges the air, and lets the drink flow down the sides of the can. The lid is placed on the can, and then crimped in two operations. A seaming head engages the lid from above while a seaming roller to the side curls the edge of the lid around the edge of the can body. The head and roller spin the can in a complete circle to seal all the way around. Then a pressure roller with a different profile drives the two edges together under pressure to make a gas-tight seal. Filled cans usually have pressurized gas inside, which makes them stiff enough for easy handling. Without the riveted tab the scored section of the can&#x27;s end would be impossible to lift from the can.

Can filling lines come in different line speeds from 15,000 cans per hour (cph) up to 120,000 cph or more, all with different levels of automation. For example, lid feeding alone starts with manual debagging onto a simple v-chute connected to the seamer up to fully automated processes with automatic debagging and lid feeding of lids combined with automatic roll depalletizers for filling debaggers by robots.

== Opening mechanisms ==

Early metal drink cans had no tabs; they were opened by a can-piercer or churchkey, a device resembling a bottle opener with a sharp point. The can was opened by punching two triangular holes in the lid—a large one for drinking, and a second smaller one to admit air.

As early as 1922, inventors were applying for patents on cans with tab tops, but the technology of the time made these inventions impractical. Later advancements saw the ends of the can made out of aluminum instead of steel.

In 1959, Ermal Fraze devised a can-opening method that would come to dominate the canned drink market. His invention was the &quot;pull-tab&quot;. This eliminated the need for a separate opener tool by attaching an aluminum pull-ring lever with a rivet to a pre-scored wedge-shaped tab section of the can top. The ring was riveted to the center of the top, which created an elongated opening large enough that one hole simultaneously served to let the drink flow out while air flowed in. 
Previously, while on a family picnic, Mr. Fraze had forgotten to bring a can opener and was forced to use a car bumper to open a can of beer. Thinking there must be an easier way, he stayed up all night until he came up with the pull tab. Pull-tab cans, or the discarded tabs from them, were colloquially called &quot;pop-tops&quot;.

Into the 1970s the pull-tab was widely popular, but its popularity came with the problem of people frequently simply discarding the pull-tabs on the ground, creating a potential injury risk especially to the feet or fingers. In the 1960s, at least one inventor attempted to solve the litter problem, by having the tab be retained by a stationary key that would wrap the tab around itself, which was unsuccessful commercially.

The problem of the discarded tops was initially solved by the invention of the push-tab. Used primarily on Coors Beer cans in the mid-1970s, the push-tab was a raised circular scored area used in place of the pull-tab. It needed no ring to pull up; instead, the raised aluminum blister was pushed down into the can using one finger. A small unscored section of the tab prevented it from detaching and falling into the can after being pushed in. Push-tabs never gained wide popularity because while they had solved the litter problem of the pull-tab, they created a safety hazard where the person&#x27;s finger upon pushing the tab into the can was immediately exposed to the sharp edges of the opening. A feature of the push-tab Coors Beer cans was that they had a second, smaller, push-tab at the top as an airflow vent. &quot;Push-tabs&quot; were introduced into Australia from around 1977 and were locally known as &quot;pop-tops&quot;, before being replaced later by the Stay-on-tab. The safety and litter problems were eventually solved later in the 1970s with Daniel F. Cudzik&#x27;s invention of the non-removing &quot;Stay-Tab&quot;.

Cans are usually in sealed paperboard cartons, corrugated fiberboard boxes, or trays covered with plastic film. The entire distribution system and packaging need to be controlled to ensure freshness.

=== Pop-tab ===
Mikolaj Kondakow and James Wong of Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada invented the pull tab version for bottles in or before 1951 (Canadian patent 476789). In 1962, Ermal Cleon Fraze of Dayton, Ohio, United States, invented the similar integral rivet and pull-tab version (also known as ring pull in British English), which had a ring attached at the rivet for pulling, and which would come off completely to be discarded. He received US Patent No. 3,349,949 for his pull-top can design in 1963 and licensed his invention to Alcoa and Pittsburgh Brewing Company, the latter of which first introduced the design on Iron City Beer cans. The first soft drinks to be sold in all-aluminum cans were R.C. Cola and Diet-Rite Cola, both made by the Royal Crown Cola company, in 1964.

The early pull-tabs detached easily. In 1976, the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; noted cases of children ingesting pull-tabs that had broken off and dropped into the can.

Full-top pull-tabs were also used in some oil cans and are currently used in some soup, pet food, tennis ball, nuts, and other cans.

=== Stay-on-tab ===

In 1958, American inventor Anthony Bajada was awarded the patent for a &quot;Lid closure for can containers&quot;. Bajada&#x27;s invention was the first design to keep the opening tab connected to the lid of the can, preventing it from falling into the contents of the can. His patent expired in 1975 and has been directly cited in the mechanisms used by companies such as Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co., BHP, and United States Steel Corporation. Approximately one month after Bajada&#x27;s patent expired, Daniel F. Cudzik, an engineer with Reynolds Metals, filed a design patent application for an &quot;End closure for a container&quot;. This later became known as a &quot;Sta-Tab&quot;. When the Sta-Tab launched in 1975, on Falls City beer and, quickly, other drinks, there was an initial period of consumer testing and education. Cudzik later received patents for this &quot;Easy Open Wall&quot; ( ). The validity of these patents was upheld in subsequent litigation.

The similarly designed &quot;Easy-open ecology end&quot; was invented by Ermal Fraze and Omar Brown. Its patent application was also filed in 1975, less than two months after the expiration of Bajada&#x27;s patent. This design, like Cudzik&#x27;s, uses a separate tab attached to the upper surface as a lever to depress a scored part of the lid, which folds underneath the top of the can and out of the way of the resulting opening, thus reducing injuries and roadside litter caused by removable tabs.

Such &quot;retained ring-pull&quot; cans supplanted pull-off tabs in the United Kingdom in 1989 for soft drinks and 1990 for alcoholic drinks.

The Stay-On-Tab (SOT) opening system solved the environmental issue of the previous pull-tab design. However, it introduced a new, still unresolved hygiene concern: the outer panel of the tab now sinks into the liquid inside the can.

One of the more recent modifications to can design was the introduction of the &quot;wide mouth&quot; can in the late 1990s. The American Can Company, now a part of Rexam, and Coors Brewing Company have owned wide mouth design patent (number D385,192) since 1997. Other companies have similar designs for the wide mouth. Ball Corporation&#x27;s from 2008 has a vent tube to allow direct airflow into the can reducing the number of gulps during the pour.

=== Press button can ===
One variation was the press button can, which featured two pre-cut buttons—one small and one large—in the top of the can sealed with a plastic membrane. These buttons were held closed by the outward pressure of the carbonated drink. The consumer would open the can by depressing both buttons, which would result in two holes. The small hole would act as a vent to relieve internal pressure so the larger button could then be pressed down to create the hole used for consuming the drink. Consumers could also easily cut themselves on the edges of the holes or get their fingers stuck.

Press button cans were used by Pepsi in Canada from the 1970s to 1980s and Coors in the 1970s. They have since been replaced with pull tabs. Used in Australia, locally known as &quot;pop-tops&quot;, for soft drinks from 1977 to the early 1980s. However, Heineken Brewery did bring back press- or push button cans on the market in Europe as a short-lived marketing strategy in the 1990s.

=== Full aperture end ===

Another variation on the drink can is the &quot;full aperture end&quot;, where the entire lid can be removed – turning an aluminum can into a cup. Crown Holdings first designed the &quot;360 End&quot; for use by SABMiller at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. It has been used by Anheuser-Busch InBev in China and Brazil and by the Sly Fox Brewing Company in the United States.

=== Resealable lid ===
Another variation on the drink can is to have a resealable lid. A version patented by Cogito Can in France has been used by Groupe Casino, the French grocery chain for its private label energy drink.

== Recycling ==

The beverage container can be recycled, and clean aluminum has residual market value, but recycled cans still need to be diluted by up to 50% virgin aluminum because the sides and tops of the can are of different alloys. The acronym UBC, for used beverage container, is employed by such companies as Apple, Inc for reference to the material of its portable laptop cases.

== Design ==
Most large companies serve their beverages in printed cans, where designs are printed on the aluminum and then crafted into a can. Alternatively, cans can be wrapped with a plastic design, mimicking the printed can but allowing for more flexibility than printed cans. A modern-day trend in craft alcohol is to design stickers to put on cans, allowing for smaller batches and quick changes for new flavors.

== Collecting ==
Beer can collecting was a minor fad in the late 1970s and 1990s. However, the hobby waned rapidly in popularity. The Beer Can Collectors of America (BCCA), founded in 1970, was an organization supporting the hobby, but has now renamed itself Brewery Collectibles Club of America to be more modern.

As of late 2009, membership in the Brewery Collectibles Club of America was 3,570, down from a peak of 11,954 in 1978. Just 19 of the members were under the age of 30, and the members&#x27; average age had increased to 59.

<text>The Dallas Opera is an American opera company located in Dallas, Texas. The company performs at the Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House, one venue of the AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center.

==History==
The company was founded in 1957 as the Dallas Civic Opera by Lawrence Kelly and Nicolà Rescigno, both of whom had been active with Lyric Opera of Chicago, the first as administrator, the second as artistic director. In its first season, Maria Callas performed in an inaugural recital conducted by Rescigno, at Music Hall at Fair Park. Critic John Ardoin described the role of Lawrence Kelly in establishing the company as follows:

: “Everything must ride or fall on the taste of one man…. As it did with Kelly and his company. He went through all kinds of crap for 10 months out of the year -- mean fund-raising and playing social games and all -- to do what he loved the most for two months out of the year. And Kelly didn&#x27;t care if you did &quot;Aida&quot;, or &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, or &quot;Carmen&quot; -- it just had to be the best &quot;Aida&quot;, and &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, and &quot;Carmen&quot;. He would agonize over it, and think it out. Nothing was ever casual with him, in the casting or the productions. That&#x27;s not to say he didn&#x27;t make mistakes. But, ultimately, it was his taste, and his vision, and his commitment that did the trick&quot;.
Many singers made their American debuts in Dallas, such as Montserrat Caballé, Plácido Domingo, Gwyneth Jones, Waltraud Meier, Magda Olivero, Joan Sutherland, and Jon Vickers. Designer/director Franco Zeffirelli also made his US debut there.

The company&#x27;s first commission was for Robert Xavier Rodriguez&#x27;s one-act children&#x27;s opera &quot;Monkey See, Monkey Do&quot; in 1985. The Dallas Opera commissioned Dominick Argento’s &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; and gave its world premiere, which was nationally broadcast on PBS&#x27;s “Great Performances” series in 1988. Additional commissions were for Tobias Picker&#x27;s &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; in 2001 and Jake Heggie&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; in 2010. Recent commissions have included British composer Joby Talbot and Gene Scheer&#x27;s &quot;Everest&quot;, &quot;Great Scott&quot; by Jake Heggie and Terrence McNally, and Mark Adamo&#x27;s &quot;Becoming Santa Claus&quot;.

The company moved to the Winspear Opera House as of the 2009-2010 season and moved its administrative offices into the building in the spring of 2010.

==Administration==
Anthony Whitworth-Jones became General Director in 2001. However, his plans for expanding the company&#x27;s repertory did not come to fruition in the wake of an economic downturn during his tenure, and he stood down from the post in 2003. 
His successor, Karen Stone, was appointed in mid-2003 as the company&#x27;s fifth General Director. She had previously worked with Graeme Jenkins at the Cologne Opera in Germany, where he was principal guest conductor. Stone resigned from the post effective 30 September 2007. 

Keith Cerny was general director and CEO from May 2010 until January 2018. During his tenure, he initiated the company&#x27;s public simulcast series in locations ranging from AT&amp;T Stadium (home of the Dallas Cowboys) to Klyde Warren Park. This included a nine-city simulcast of Tod Machover&#x27;s &quot;Death and the Powers&quot;. Cerny is credited with stabilizing company finances, which allowed both the commissioning of new operas and new initiatives such as the &quot;Linda and Mitch Hart Institute for Women Conductors at The Dallas Opera&quot; (2015) designed to address the challenge of gender imbalance at the top levels of the classical music industry. In November 2015, Cerny&#x27;s existing contract as General Director and CEO was extended until 2022. In December 2017, the company announced Cerny&#x27;s resignation from the Dallas Opera, effective January 2018.

French conductor Emmanuel Villaume became the company&#x27;s music director on 30 April 2013. Graeme Jenkins, who was music director from 1994 to 2013, now has the title of Music Director Emeritus with the company. In November 2015, Villaume&#x27;s contract was extended through June 2022.

In April 2018, the company announced the appointment of Ian Derrer as its next general director and CEO effective July 2018. He previously worked with Dallas Opera from 2014 to 2016 as an artistic administrator.

<text>Graeme James Ewers Jenkins (born 1958 in London, United Kingdom) is a British conductor, specializing in opera. He read music at the University of Cambridge, and later studied conducting at the Royal College of Music. He worked with Norman Del Mar and Sir David Willcocks, and as an Adrian Boult Conducting Scholar, Jenkins conducted Britten&#x27;s Albert Herring and The Turn of the Screw. From 1986 to 1991, he was music director of Glyndebourne Touring Opera.

Jenkins made his first conducting appearance with the Dallas Opera in 1992, and in 1994, became the company&#x27;s music director. In Dallas, he became the youngest ever British conductor to have conducted Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. In May 2007, Jenkins extended his Dallas contract to May 2011. Subsequent to a further extension of his Dallas contract to May 2013, the Dallas Opera announced in May 2011 the conclusion of Jenkins&#x27; tenure after the 2012–2013 season. He now has the title of Music Director Emeritus of the Dallas Opera.

<text>The celestial spheres, or celestial orbs, were the fundamental entities of the cosmological models developed by Plato, Eudoxus, Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus, and others. In these celestial models, the apparent motions of the fixed stars and planets are accounted for by treating them as embedded in rotating spheres made of an aetherial, transparent fifth element (quintessence), like gems set in orbs. Since it was believed that the fixed stars did not change their positions relative to one another, it was argued that they must be on the surface of a single starry sphere.

In modern thought, the orbits of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, considered the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy&#x27;s epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at the time for the distances to the Sun: about , to the other planets, and to the edge of the universe: about . The nested sphere model&#x27;s distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances, and the size of the universe is now known to be inconceivably large and continuously expanding.

Albert Van Helden has suggested that from about 1250 until the 17th century, virtually all educated Europeans were familiar with the Ptolemaic model of &quot;nesting spheres and the cosmic dimensions derived from it&quot;. Even following the adoption of Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentric model of the universe, new versions of the celestial sphere model were introduced, with the planetary spheres following this sequence from the central Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth-Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

Mainstream belief in the theory of celestial spheres did not survive the Scientific Revolution. In the early 1600s, Kepler continued to discuss celestial spheres, although he did not consider that the planets were carried by the spheres but held that they moved in elliptical paths described by Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion. In the late 1600s, Greek and medieval theories concerning the motion of terrestrial and celestial objects were replaced by Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation and Newtonian mechanics, which explain how Kepler&#x27;s laws arise from the gravitational attraction between bodies.

==History==
===Early ideas of spheres and circles===

In Greek antiquity the ideas of celestial spheres and rings first appeared in the cosmology of Anaximander in the early 6th century BC. In his cosmology both the Sun and Moon are circular open vents in tubular rings of fire enclosed in tubes of condensed air; these rings constitute the rims of rotating chariot-like wheels pivoting on the Earth at their centre. The fixed stars are also open vents in such wheel rims, but there are so many such wheels for the stars that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these wheel rims had originally been formed out of an original sphere of fire wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings. Hence, in Anaximanders&#x27;s cosmogony, in the beginning was the sphere, out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar sphere was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the sphere of the stars was lowest.

Following Anaximander, his pupil Anaximenes () held that the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets are all made of fire. But whilst the stars are fastened on a revolving crystal sphere like nails or studs, the Sun, Moon, and planets, and also the Earth, all just ride on air like leaves because of their breadth. And whilst the fixed stars are carried around in a complete circle by the stellar sphere, the Sun, Moon and planets do not revolve under the Earth between setting and rising again like the stars do, but rather on setting they go laterally around the Earth like a cap turning halfway around the head until they rise again. And unlike Anaximander, he relegated the fixed stars to the region most distant from the Earth. The most enduring feature of Anaximenes&#x27; cosmos was its conception of the stars being fixed on a crystal sphere as in a rigid frame, which became a fundamental principle of cosmology down to Copernicus and Kepler.

After Anaximenes, Pythagoras, Xenophanes and Parmenides all held that the universe was spherical. And much later in the fourth century BC Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; proposed that the body of the cosmos was made in the most perfect and uniform shape, that of a sphere containing the fixed stars. But it posited that the planets were spherical bodies set in rotating bands or rings rather than wheel rims as in Anaximander&#x27;s cosmology.

===Emergence of the planetary spheres===

Instead of bands, Plato&#x27;s student Eudoxus developed a planetary model using concentric spheres for all the planets, with three spheres each for his models of the Moon and the Sun and four each for the models of the other five planets, thus making 26 spheres in all. Callippus modified this system, using five spheres for his models of the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars and retaining four spheres for the models of Jupiter and Saturn, thus making 33 spheres in all. Each planet is attached to the innermost of its own particular set of spheres. Although the models of Eudoxus and Callippus qualitatively describe the major features of the motion of the planets, they fail to account exactly for these motions and therefore cannot provide quantitative predictions. Although historians of Greek science have traditionally considered these models to be merely geometrical representations, recent studies have proposed that they were also intended to be physically real or have withheld judgment, noting the limited evidence to resolve the question.

In his &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, Aristotle developed a physical cosmology of spheres, based on the mathematical models of Eudoxus. In Aristotle&#x27;s fully developed celestial model, the spherical Earth is at the centre of the universe and the planets are moved by either 47 or 55 interconnected spheres that form a unified planetary system, whereas in the models of Eudoxus and Callippus each planet&#x27;s individual set of spheres were not connected to those of the next planet. Aristotle says the exact number of spheres, and hence the number of movers, is to be determined by astronomical investigation, but he added additional spheres to those proposed by Eudoxus and Callippus, to counteract the motion of the outer spheres. Aristotle considers that these spheres are made of an unchanging fifth element, the aether. Each of these concentric spheres is moved by its own god—an unchanging divine unmoved mover, and who moves its sphere simply by virtue of being loved by it.

In his &quot;Almagest&quot;, the astronomer Ptolemy (fl. c. 150 AD) developed geometrical predictive models of the motions of the stars and planets and extended them to a unified physical model of the cosmos in his &quot;Planetary hypotheses&quot;. By using eccentrics and epicycles, his geometrical model achieved greater mathematical detail and predictive accuracy than had been exhibited by earlier concentric spherical models of the cosmos. In Ptolemy&#x27;s physical model, each planet is contained in two or more spheres, but in Book 2 of his &quot;Planetary Hypotheses&quot; Ptolemy depicted thick circular slices rather than spheres as in its Book 1. One sphere/slice is the deferent, with a centre offset somewhat from the Earth; the other sphere/slice is an epicycle embedded in the deferent, with the planet embedded in the epicyclical sphere/slice. Ptolemy&#x27;s model of nesting spheres provided the general dimensions of the cosmos, the greatest distance of Saturn being 19,865 times the radius of the Earth and the distance of the fixed stars being at least 20,000 Earth radii.

The planetary spheres were arranged outwards from the spherical, stationary Earth at the centre of the universe in this order: the spheres of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In more detailed models the seven planetary spheres contained other secondary spheres within them. The planetary spheres were followed by the stellar sphere containing the fixed stars; other scholars added a ninth sphere to account for the precession of the equinoxes, a tenth to account for the supposed trepidation of the equinoxes, and even an eleventh to account for the changing obliquity of the ecliptic. In antiquity the order of the lower planets was not universally agreed. Plato and his followers ordered them Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, and then followed the standard model for the upper spheres. Others disagreed about the relative place of the spheres of Mercury and Venus: Ptolemy placed both of them beneath the Sun with Venus above Mercury, but noted others placed them both above the Sun; some medieval thinkers, such as al-Bitruji, placed the sphere of Venus above the Sun and that of Mercury below it.

===Middle Ages===
====Astronomical discussions====
A series of astronomers, beginning with the Muslim astronomer al-Farghānī, used the Ptolemaic model of nesting spheres to compute distances to the stars and planetary spheres. Al-Farghānī&#x27;s distance to the stars was 20,110 Earth radii which, on the assumption that the radius of the Earth was , came to . An introduction to Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, the &quot;Tashil al-Majisti&quot;, believed to be written by Thābit ibn Qurra, presented minor variations of Ptolemy&#x27;s distances to the celestial spheres. In his &quot;Zij&quot;, Al-Battānī presented independent calculations of the distances to the planets on the model of nesting spheres, which he thought was due to scholars writing after Ptolemy. His calculations yielded a distance of 19,000 Earth radii to the stars.

Around the turn of the millennium, the Arabic astronomer and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy&#x27;s geocentric models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Planetary Hypotheses&quot;, al-Haytham&#x27;s presentation differs in sufficient detail that it has been argued that it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his &quot;Book of Optics&quot;, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.

Near the end of the twelfth century, the Spanish Muslim astronomer al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy&#x27;s epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.

In the thirteenth century the astronomer al-&#x27;Urḍi proposed a radical change to Ptolemy&#x27;s system of nesting spheres. In his &quot;Kitāb al-Hayáh&quot;, he recalculated the distance of the planets using parameters which he redetermined. Taking the distance of the Sun as 1,266 Earth radii, he was forced to place the sphere of Venus above the sphere of the Sun; as a further refinement, he added the planet&#x27;s diameters to the thickness of their spheres. As a consequence, his version of the nesting spheres model had the sphere of the stars at a distance of 140,177 Earth radii.

About the same time, scholars in European universities began to address the implications of the rediscovered philosophy of Aristotle and astronomy of Ptolemy. Both astronomical scholars and popular writers considered the implications of the nested sphere model for the dimensions of the universe. Campanus of Novara&#x27;s introductory astronomical text, the &quot;Theorica planetarum&quot;, used the model of nesting spheres to compute the distances of the various planets from the Earth, which he gave as 22,612 Earth radii or . In his &quot;Opus Majus&quot;, Roger Bacon cited Al-Farghānī&#x27;s distance to the stars of 20,110 Earth radii, or , from which he computed the circumference of the universe to be . Clear evidence that this model was thought to represent physical reality is the accounts found in Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Opus Majus&quot; of the time needed to walk to the Moon and in the popular Middle English &quot;South English Legendary&quot;, that it would take 8,000 years to reach the highest starry heaven. General understanding of the dimensions of the universe derived from the nested sphere model reached wider audiences through the presentations in Hebrew by Moses Maimonides, in French by Gossuin of Metz, and in Italian by Dante Alighieri.

====Philosophical and theological discussions====

Philosophers were less concerned with such mathematical calculations than with the nature of the celestial spheres, their relation to revealed accounts of created nature, and the causes of their motion.

Adi Setia describes the debate among Islamic scholars in the twelfth century, based on the commentary of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi about whether the celestial spheres are real, concrete physical bodies or &quot;merely the abstract circles in the heavens traced out… by the various stars and planets.&quot; Setia points out that most of the learned, and the astronomers, said they were solid spheres &quot;on which the stars turn… and this view is closer to the apparent sense of the Qur&#x27;anic verses regarding the celestial orbits.&quot; However, al-Razi mentions that some, such as the Islamic scholar Dahhak, considered them to be abstract. Al-Razi himself, was undecided, he said: &quot;In truth, there is no way to ascertain the characteristics of the heavens except by authority [of divine revelation or prophetic traditions].&quot; Setia concludes: &quot;Thus it seems that for al-Razi (and for others before and after him), astronomical models, whatever their utility or lack thereof for ordering the heavens, are not founded on sound rational proofs, and so no intellectual commitment can be made to them insofar as description and explanation of celestial realities are concerned.&quot;

Christian and Muslim philosophers modified Ptolemy&#x27;s system to include an unmoved outermost region, the empyrean heaven, which came to be identified as the dwelling place of God and all the elect. Medieval Christians identified the sphere of stars with the Biblical firmament and sometimes posited an invisible layer of water above the firmament, to accord with Genesis. An outer sphere, inhabited by angels, appeared in some accounts.

Edward Grant, a historian of science, has provided evidence that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid in the sense of three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid in the sense of hard. The consensus was that the celestial spheres were made of some kind of continuous fluid.

Later in the century, the mutakallim Adud al-Din al-Iji (1281–1355) rejected the principle of uniform and circular motion, following the Ash&#x27;ari doctrine of atomism, which maintained that all physical effects were caused directly by God&#x27;s will rather than by natural causes. He maintained that the celestial spheres were &quot;imaginary things&quot; and &quot;more tenuous than a spider&#x27;s web&quot;. His views were challenged by al-Jurjani (1339–1413), who maintained that even if the celestial spheres &quot;do not have an external reality, yet they are things that are correctly imagined and correspond to what [exists] in actuality&quot;.

Medieval astronomers and philosophers developed diverse theories about the causes of the celestial spheres&#x27; motions. They attempted to explain the spheres&#x27; motions in terms of the materials of which they were thought to be made, external movers such as celestial intelligences, and internal movers such as motive souls or impressed forces. Most of these models were qualitative, although a few incorporated quantitative analyses that related speed, motive force and resistance. By the end of the Middle Ages, the common opinion in Europe was that celestial bodies were moved by external intelligences, identified with the angels of revelation. The outermost moving sphere, which moved with the daily motion affecting all subordinate spheres, was moved by an unmoved mover, the Prime Mover, who was identified with God. Each of the lower spheres was moved by a subordinate spiritual mover (a replacement for Aristotle&#x27;s multiple divine movers), called an intelligence.

===Renaissance===

Early in the sixteenth century Nicolaus Copernicus drastically reformed the model of astronomy by displacing the Earth from its central place in favour of the Sun, yet he called his great work &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (&quot;On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres&quot;). Although Copernicus does not treat the physical nature of the spheres in detail, his few allusions make it clear that, like many of his predecessors, he accepted non-solid celestial spheres. Copernicus rejected the ninth and tenth spheres, placed the orb of the Moon around the Earth, and moved the Sun from its orb to the center of the universe. The planetary orbs circled the center of the universe in the following order: Mercury, Venus, the great orb containing the Earth and the orb of the Moon, then the orbs of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Finally he retained the eighth sphere of the stars, which he held to be stationary.

The English almanac maker, Thomas Digges, delineated the spheres of the new cosmological system in his &quot;Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes …&quot; (1576). Here he arranged the &quot;orbes&quot; in the new Copernican order, expanding one sphere to carry &quot;the globe of mortalitye&quot;, the Earth, the four classical elements, and the Moon, and expanding the sphere of stars infinitely to encompass all the stars and also to serve as &quot;the court of the Great God, the habitacle of the elect, and of the coelestiall angelles.&quot;
In the sixteenth century, a number of philosophers, theologians, and astronomers—among them Francesco Patrizi, Andrea Cisalpino, Peter Ramus, Robert Bellarmine, Giordano Bruno, Jerónimo Muñoz, Michael Neander, Jean Pena, and Christoph Rothmann—abandoned the concept of celestial spheres. Rothmann argued from observations of the comet of 1585 that the lack of observed parallax indicated that the comet was beyond Saturn, while the absence of observed refraction indicated the celestial region was of the same material as air, hence there were no planetary spheres.

Tycho Brahe&#x27;s investigations of a series of comets from 1577 to 1585, aided by Rothmann&#x27;s discussion of the comet of 1585 and Michael Maestlin&#x27;s tabulated distances of the comet of 1577, which passed through the planetary orbs, led Tycho to conclude that &quot;the structure of the heavens was very fluid and simple.&quot; Tycho opposed his view to that of &quot;very many modern philosophers&quot; who divided the heavens into &quot;various orbs made of hard and impervious matter.&quot; Edward Grant found relatively few believers in hard celestial spheres before Copernicus and concluded that the idea first became common sometime between the publication of Copernicus&#x27;s &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; in 1542 and Tycho Brahe&#x27;s publication of his cometary research in 1588.

In his early &quot;Mysterium Cosmographicum&quot;, Johannes Kepler considered the distances of the planets and the consequent gaps required between the planetary spheres implied by the Copernican system, which had been noted by his former teacher, Michael Maestlin. Kepler&#x27;s Platonic cosmology filled the large gaps with the five Platonic polyhedra, which accounted for the spheres&#x27; measured astronomical distance. In Kepler&#x27;s mature celestial physics, the spheres were regarded as the purely geometric spatial regions containing each planetary orbit rather than as the rotating physical orbs of the earlier Aristotelian celestial physics. The eccentricity of each planet&#x27;s orbit thereby defined the radii of the inner and outer limits of its celestial sphere and thus its thickness. In Kepler&#x27;s celestial mechanics, the cause of planetary motion became the rotating Sun, itself rotated by its own motive soul. However, an immobile stellar sphere was a lasting remnant of physical celestial spheres in Kepler&#x27;s cosmology.

==Literary and visual expressions==


In Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Dream of Scipio,&quot; the elder Scipio Africanus describes an ascent through the celestial spheres, compared to which the Earth and the Roman Empire dwindle into insignificance. A commentary on the &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot; by the Roman writer Macrobius, which included a discussion of the various schools of thought on the order of the spheres, did much to spread the idea of the celestial spheres through the Early Middle Ages.
Some late medieval figures noted that the celestial spheres&#x27; physical order was inverse to their order on the spiritual plane, where God was at the center and the Earth at the periphery. Near the beginning of the fourteenth century Dante, in the &quot;Paradiso&quot; of his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, described God as a light at the center of the cosmos. Here the poet ascends beyond physical existence to the Empyrean Heaven, where he comes face to face with God himself and is granted understanding of both divine and human nature. Later in the century, the illuminator of Nicole Oresme&#x27;s , a translation of and commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De caelo&quot; produced for Oresme&#x27;s patron, King Charles V, employed the same motif. He drew the spheres in the conventional order, with the Moon closest to the Earth and the stars highest, but the spheres were concave upwards, centered on God, rather than concave downwards, centered on the Earth. Below this figure Oresme quotes the Psalms that &quot;The heavens declare the Glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork.&quot;

The late-16th-century Portuguese epic &quot;The Lusiads&quot; vividly portrays the celestial spheres as a &quot;great machine of the universe&quot; constructed by God. The explorer Vasco da Gama is shown the celestial spheres in the form of a mechanical model. Contrary to Cicero&#x27;s representation, da Gama&#x27;s tour of the spheres begins with the Empyrean, then descends inward toward Earth, culminating in a survey of the domains and divisions of earthly kingdoms, thus magnifying the importance of human deeds in the divine plan.

<text>California State University, Long Beach (CSULB), also known in athletics as Long Beach State University (LBSU), is a public teaching-focused institution in Long Beach, California. The 322-acre campus is the second largest in the California State University system (CSU). The university enrolls around 35,843 undergraduate students and 5,346 graduate students as of fall 2024. The graduate programs include master&#x27;s degrees, credentials, post-baccalaureate certificates, and doctoral programs. CSULB is classified as an &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High Research Activity&quot;. The university offers four doctoral programs: Educational Leadership (Ed.D.), Engineering and Computational Mathematics (Ph.D.), Physical Therapy (DPT) and Nursing Practice (DNP).

The university is home to one of the largest publicly funded art schools in the United States. The university is a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) and is eligible to be designated as an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander serving institution (AANAPISI).

==History==
The college was established in 1949 by California governor Earl Warren, to serve the rapidly expanding post-World War II population of Orange and Southern Los Angeles counties. The institution was first named as Los Angeles-Orange County State College. Peter Victor Peterson was its first president. It offered 25 courses, taught by 13 faculty members, in two apartment buildings at 5381 Anaheim Road in Long Beach. In June 1950, the a $1 million, plot of land was purchased as a permanent campus for the renamed Long Beach State College, following an &quot;overwhelming&quot; vote from the city&#x27;s population. Student enrollment subsequently grew rapidly.

Carl W. McIntosh was named the college&#x27;s second president in 1959. While McIntosh was president, the school&#x27;s enrollment surged from about 10,000 to over 30,000, and he rapidly expanded and revamped the curriculum. McIntosh tripled the number of faculty and constructed 30 new campus buildings. Although the 1960s were a period of deep unrest on American college campuses, McIntosh&#x27;s collegial governing style, gentle public demeanor, and willingness to permit peaceful protest on campus helped preserve Long Beach State College relatively serene social climate. In 1964, the school changed its name to California State College at Long Beach. In 1967, the California state legislature revamped the state college system. As part of these changes, the university was renamed California State College, Long Beach in 1968 and became closely integrated into the California State College system.

In 1965, CSULB hosted the first International Sculpture Symposium to be held both at a higher education institution and in the United States. Six international and two American sculptors many of the on-campus installations. The event received national media attention from major newspapers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot;.

McIntosh departed for Montana State University in 1969, and was succeeded by President Steve Horn. The California State University Board of Trustees elevated the school to university status in 1972, along with 12 other state college campuses, based on total enrollment, size of graduate programs, complexity and diversity of majors and number of doctorates held by faculty at each college. Later that year, the campus opened the largest library facility in the then 19-campus CSU system: a modern six-story building with a seating capacity of nearly 4,000 students.

In 1995, President Robert Maxson initiated the privately funded President&#x27;s Scholars Program, providing selected qualified California high school valedictorians and National Merit finalists and semi-finalists with a full four-year scholarship package, including tuition, a book stipend, and housing. , over 1000 students have accepted the scholarship. For applicants for fall 2010, National Achievement Program Semifinalists/Finalists and National Hispanic Recognition scholars were also considered.

In August 2020, CSULB unveiled its new shark mascot, Elbee, following a 2019 student-led process that selected the shark as Beach&#x27;s new mascot. While Elbee is a shark, the university&#x27;s Division I intercollegiate athletics program remains &quot;Beach Athletics&quot;. As of 2022, the university was classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot; in recognition of the university&#x27;s evolution from a master&#x27;s-level comprehensive institution to one that awards doctorates and conducts a significant amount of research.

==Campus==
The campus spans across 84 buildings, and is located from the Pacific Ocean. CSULB is located at 1250 Bellflower Boulevard. It is bounded by East 7th Street to the south, East Atherton Street to the north, Bellflower Boulevard to the west, and Palo Verde Avenue to the east.

===Architecture===
The architecture of the campus is mainly of the International style (designed primarily by architect Edward Killingsworth). It is minimalist. It has earned design awards and awards from gardening societies. The integration of landscaping and architecture is apparent at the school&#x27;s theater complex, where a dense grove of ficus trees is planted in such a way that it forms a continuation of the pillar-supported canopy at the theater&#x27;s entrance. The university&#x27;s registration offices are located in the open courtyard of Brotman Hall, which is &quot;roofed&quot; by a similar jungle-like canopy.

===Campus landmarks===
The University Student Union (USU) building is located at the center of campus. The three-story glass building occupies roughly , housing numerous offices, and offering more casual attractions, including a study lounge, a ballroom, a food court, a bowling alley, an arcade, and a movie theater.

The Rec and Wellness Center is an extensive all-purpose athletic center covering about on North Campus. It was completed in 2010. It includes facilities for fitness programs and aerobics classes, courts for volleyball, basketball, badminton, rock climbing walls, an indoor track, a student lounge, and much more. The center is funded and managed by CSULB&#x27;s Associated Students, Incorporated (ASI).

49er basketball and volleyball games are currently played in the iconic, eighteen-story Walter Pyramid (formerly known as the Long Beach Pyramid) located on north campus. The Pyramid is a sporting complex that can accommodate over 5,000 fans, including temporary seating and standing room. Two sections of interior stands are fitted with large hydraulic lifts that can lift the seating elements 45 degrees into the air, creating room for five volleyball courts or three basketball courts. The Pyramid is home to the Southern California Summer Pro League, a noted showcase for current and prospective NBA basketball players.

The University Art Museum&#x27;s permanent collection contains primarily abstract expressionist paintings, works on paper, and an outdoor sculpture garden that began in 1966. The UAM was the first accredited museum in the CSU system. In addition, the museum&#x27;s Gordon F. Hampton collection is housed at the Downtown Los Angeles law offices of Sheppard Mullin.

The campus is also home to the Carpenter Performing Arts Center, a 1,074-seat theater named after CSULB alumni Richard and Karen Carpenter.

The Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden is an artistic retreat of solitude and beauty. Among its many picturesque attractions, the Garden features a large pond populated with koi.

===Puvungna===

The campus is built on the ancient Tongva village and burial site known as Puvungna (&quot;the place of the gathering&quot; or &quot;in the ball&quot;), which is a sacred site for the Tongva and Acjachemen. In 1974, the now twenty-two acre site was added to the National Register of Historic Places after the site was uncovered in the development of the nearby Japanese Garden.

From 1992 to 1995, CSULB attempted to challenge this designation in order to commercially develop the site into a strip mall and student housing. The Tongva people filed a lawsuit and initiated a protest, which involved physically occupying the land day and night to stave off bulldozers even while threatened with arrest by campus officials.

In 2019, the university dumped dirt and debris onto the site and drove heavy equipment over the ground in the construction of a new student housing development. This was received negatively by the Tongva and Acjachemen, who organized in an attempt to preserve the site from future damage. The site remains a natural area with a few trees.

===Campus sustainability===
The university, in its push to support climate sustainability, installed solar panels on the Brotman Hall building and the Facilities Management canopy parking in 2007. 

The Environmental Science &amp; Policy Club (ES&amp;P Club) has brought support to environmental awareness and sustainability through club activities, such as coastal clean-ups, hikes, plant-restoration project, tabling, conferences, guest speakers, &amp; Kaleidoscope. In 2006, the ES&amp;P Club supported the installation of waterless urinals in the university&#x27;s men&#x27;s restrooms. The ES&amp;P Club hosts an annual Earth Week celebration each April, including documentary screenings, discussions, and speaker series.

In addition, there has been a push in recent years to revive the organic gardens on campus, culminating in 2015 with the launch of the Grow Beach University Gardens, a student-led ASI sub-group that promotes organic gardening and sustainable agriculture on campus. The new garden boxes are part of a campus-wide effort to provide a natural, organic, and convenient garden right on campus for student and faculty use.

The university &quot;has a comprehensive energy management program incorporating real-time metering and energy-saving technologies such as the EnergySaver, which provides a more sophisticated alternative to turning off the lights by automatically varying the voltage to the ballasted fixtures and reducing the power consumed, while maintaining appropriate lighting levels.&quot;

===Desert Studies Center===

==Student life==
===Campus publications===

The university has three student publications: the &quot;Long Beach Current&quot; (until 2024 known as the &quot;Daily Forty-Niner&quot;), &quot;22 West Magazine&quot; (formerly &quot;The Long Beach Union Newspaper&quot;) and &quot;DIG Magazine.&quot;

The first issue of the campus newspaper was published on November 11, 1949 as &quot;The Forty-Niner.&quot; The newspaper was renamed on September 3, 1975, as the &quot;Daily Forty-Niner&quot;, and then rebranded to &quot;Long Beach Current&quot; on August 19, 2024.It publishes Monday through Thursday during the fall and spring semesters, and once weekly during the summer sessions. It was one of the first college newspapers in the country to have an Internet edition, starting in August 1994.

&quot;22 West Magazine&quot;, which is partially student-funded, and affiliated with ASI, publishes every month during fall and spring semesters. It began on April 22, 1977, when it was formed in response to the &quot;Daily 49er&quot;. The &quot;Union Weekly&quot; focuses on being an alternative voice on campus and features a satirical section called &quot;The Grunion&quot; (not to be confused with the Long Beach paper the Grunion Gazette). During the late 1970s through 1980s, the &quot;Union&quot; was a daily newspaper, giving heavy competition to the &quot;Daily 49er&quot;. Journalism majors who worked on the &quot;Union&quot; did so under a pseudonym as it was a practice forbidden by the dean of the Journalism department.

&quot;DIG Magazine&quot;, the campus magazine, has gone through many changes throughout the years. It started off as &quot;The Lantern&quot;, a magazine for night-time students, before transforming to &quot;UniverCity&quot; in 1973. Then, it turned into &quot;University Magazine.&quot; In the early 2000s, the magazine transformed to &quot;DIG Magazine&quot; as a music magazine before transitioning to a general art &amp; culture magazine. Today, the magazine features interesting people and groups within the community, and discusses topics that concern students&#x27; interests.

===KKJZ 88.1 FM===
The California State University Long Beach Foundation owns the KKJZ non-commercial broadcast license of 88.1 FM, a jazz and blues radio station. Global Jazz, Inc., an affiliate of Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters, Inc., programs and manages the radio station. In 2015, Global Jazz moved the station thirty miles from Long Beach to West Los Angeles. While KKJZ began as a radio station exclusively playing Jazz and Blues music it has recently expanded its playlist to include Rhythm and Blues artists.

===22 West Radio===
22 West Radio is a free format, student run internet radio station at CSU, Long Beach. It is also an HD Radio station via 88.1 HD3 . The radio station is operated year-round. The station has been around in various forms since the mid-1970s, then known as KSUL (which went defunct after 1981). 22 West Radio is a department of Associated Students, Incorporated at CSULB and is both funded and regulated by them.

===Student Recreation and Wellness Center===

The $70 million Student Recreation and Wellness Center is located on the northeast side of campus. It opened in fall 2010.

===Greek life – sororities and fraternities===
There are several national sororities and fraternities on campus. Sigma Chi&#x27;s expulsion in 2018 caused controversy within the student body.

==Athletics==
Long Beach State competes in NCAA Division I in 18 sports teams and plays competitively in baseball, cross country, softball, track and field, women&#x27;s tennis, and women&#x27;s soccer, as well as both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, volleyball, water polo and golf teams. The university is a founding member of the Big West Conference, and also competes in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation for sports not sponsored by the Big West.

In the realm of sports the school is branded as &quot;Long Beach State&quot;. &quot;Beach&quot;, which had long been unofficially used to refer to Long Beach State and its sports teams as it is the only university on the West Coast with the word &quot;Beach&quot; in its name, became the official athletic program brand name in the 2020–21 school year. One can see the cheer &quot;Go Beach!&quot; written on many CSULB products around campus and on the large water tower near the entrance to the campus.

The school colors have been black and gold since 2000, when they were changed by a student referendum (after George Allen changed the football uniform colors) from the original brown and gold.

Long Beach State is home to one of the top women&#x27;s volleyball teams in the nation. Long Beach State has won three national titles in women&#x27;s volleyball, in 1989, 1993 and 1998. The 1998 women&#x27;s team was the first team in NCAA Division I history to have an undefeated season. The team&#x27;s most famous alumna is Misty May-Treanor, who won three Olympic gold medals in Beach Volleyball in 2004, 2008, and 2012. Long Beach is also the only California State University to participate in the Golden Coast Conference for Men&#x27;s Water polo not sponsored by the Big West Conference the Division Long Beach participates for in NCAA Division I.

Because of the proximity to California State University, Fullerton, the schools are considered rivals. The rivalry is especially heated in baseball with the Long Beach State baseball team also having a competitive college baseball program.

<text>Flip chip, also known as controlled collapse chip connection or its abbreviation, C4, is a method for interconnecting dies such as semiconductor devices, IC chips, integrated passive devices and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), to external circuitry with solder bumps that have been deposited onto the chip pads. The technique was developed by General Electric&#x27;s Light Military Electronics Department, Utica, New York. The solder bumps are deposited on the chip pads on the top side of the wafer during the final wafer processing step. In order to mount the chip to external circuitry (e.g., a circuit board or another chip or wafer), it is flipped over so that its top side faces down, and aligned so that its pads align with matching pads on the external circuit, and then the solder is reflowed to complete the interconnect. This is in contrast to wire bonding, in which the chip is mounted upright and fine wires are welded onto the chip pads and lead frame contacts to interconnect the chip pads to external circuitry.

==Process steps==
#Integrated circuits are created on the wafer.
#Pads are metallized on the surface of the chips.
#A solder ball is deposited on each of the pads, in a process called wafer bumping
#Chips are cut.
#Chips are flipped and positioned so that the solder balls are facing the connectors on the external circuitry.
#Solder balls are then remelted (typically using hot air reflow).
#Mounted chip is &quot;underfilled&quot; using a (capillary, shown here) electrically-insulating adhesive.

==Comparison of mounting technologies==

===Wire bonding/thermosonic bonding===

In typical semiconductor fabrication systems, chips are built up in large numbers on a single large wafer of semiconductor material, typically silicon. The individual chips are patterned with small pads of metal near their edges that serve as the connections to an eventual mechanical carrier. The chips are then cut out of the wafer and attached to their carriers, typically via wire bonding such as thermosonic bonding. These wires eventually lead to pins on the outside of the carriers, which are attached to the rest of the circuitry making up the electronic system.

===Flip chip===
Processing a flip chip is similar to conventional IC fabrication, with a few additional steps. Near the end of the manufacturing process, the attachment pads are metalized to make them more receptive to solder. This typically consists of several treatments. A small dot of solder is then deposited on each metalized pad. The chips are then cut out of the wafer as normal.

To attach the flip chip into a circuit, the chip is inverted to bring the solder dots down onto connectors or pads on the underlying electronics or circuit board or substrate. The solder is then re-melted to produce an electrical connection, typically using a thermosonic bonding or alternatively reflow solder process.

This also leaves a small space between the chip&#x27;s circuitry and the underlying mounting. In many cases an electrically-insulating adhesive is then &quot;underfilled&quot; to provide a stronger mechanical connection, provide a heat bridge, and to ensure the solder joints are not stressed due to differential heating of the chip and the rest of the system.
The underfill distributes the thermal expansion mismatch between the chip and the board, preventing stress concentration in the solder joints which would lead to premature failure. 

Solder balls can be mounted on the chips by separately making the balls and then attaching them to the chips by using a vacuum pick up device to pick up the balls and then placing them into a chip with flux applied on contact pads for the balls, or by wafer bumping which consists of electroplating in which seed metals are first deposited onto a wafer with the chips to be bumped. This allows the solder to adhere to the contact pads of the chips during the electroplating process. The seed metals are alloys and are deposited by sputtering onto the wafer with the chips to be bumped. A photoresist mask is used to only deposit the seed metal on top of the contact pads of the chips. The wafer then undergoes electroplating, and the photoresist layer is removed or stripped. Then the solder on the chips undergoes solder reflow to form the bumps into their final shape. Solder balls are often 75 to 500 microns in diameter.

In 2008, High-speed mounting methods evolved through a cooperation between Reel Service Ltd. and Siemens AG in the development of a high speed mounting tape known as &#x27;MicroTape&#x27;. By adding a tape-and-reel process into the assembly methodology, placement at high speed is possible, achieving a 99.90% pick rate and a placement rate of 21,000 cph (components per hour), using standard PCB assembly equipment.

Flip chip packages often consist of a silicon die sitting on top of a &quot;substrate&quot; which then sits on top of a traditional PCB. The substrate can have a Ball Grid Array (BGA) on its underside. The substrate makes the connections to the die available for use by the PCB. Substates made with build up 
film such as Ajinomoto Build up Film (ABF), are manufactured around a core, and the film is stacked on the core in layers by vacuum lamination at high temperatures. After each layer is applied, the film is cured, and laser vias are made with CO2 or UV lasers, then the blind vias in the substrate are cleaned and the build up film is roughened chemically with a permanganate, and then copper is deposited using electroless copper plating, followed by creating a pattern on the copper using photolithography and etching, and then this process is repeated for every layer of the substrate.

===Tape-automated bonding===
Tape-automated bonding (TAB) was developed for connecting dies with thermocompression or thermosonic bonding to a flexible substrate including from one to three conductive layers. Also with TAB it is possible to connect die pins all at the same time as with the soldering based flip chip mounting. Originally TAB could produce finer pitch interconnections compared to flip chip, but with the development of the flip chip this advantage has diminished and has kept TAB to be a specialized interconnection technique of display drivers or similar requiring specific TAB compliant roll-to-roll (R2R, reel-to-reel) like assembly system.

===Advantages===
The resulting completed flip chip assembly is much smaller than a traditional carrier-based system; the chip sits directly on the circuit board, and is much smaller than the carrier both in area and height. The short wires greatly reduce inductance, allowing higher-speed signals, and also conduct heat better.

===Disadvantages===
Flip chips have several disadvantages.

The lack of a carrier means they are not suitable for easy replacement, or unaided manual installation. They also require very flat mounting surfaces, which is not always easy to arrange, or sometimes difficult to maintain as the boards heat and cool. This limits the maximum device size.

Also, the short connections are very stiff, so the thermal expansion of the chip must be matched to the supporting board or the connections can crack. The underfill material acts as an intermediate between the difference in CTE of the chip and board.

==History==
The process was originally introduced commercially by IBM in the 1960s for individual transistors and diodes packaged for use in their mainframe systems.

Ceramic subtrates for flip chip BGA were replaced with organic substrates to reduce costs and use existing PCB manufacturing techniques to produce more packages at a time by using larger PCB panels during manufacturing. Ajinomoto Build up Film (ABF) was developed in 1999 and has become a material widely used in flip chip packages, used for manufacturing flip chip substrates in a semi-additive process, first pioneered by Intel. Build up film helped transition the industry away from ceramic substrates, and this film is now essential in the production of organic flip chip package substrates.

==Alternatives==
Since the flip chip&#x27;s introduction a number of alternatives to the solder bumps have been introduced, including gold balls or molded studs, electrically conductive polymer and the &quot;plated bump&quot; process that &quot;removes&quot; an insulating plating by chemical means. Flip chips have recently gained popularity among manufacturers of cell phones and other small electronics where the size savings are valuable.

<doc id="383134" wikidata="Q969176" url="?curid=383134" title="Edward Bach">
<text>Edward Bach ( ; 24 September 1886 – 27 November 1936) was a British medical doctor, bacteriologist, homeopath, and spiritual writer, best known for developing the Bach flower remedies, a form of alternative medicine inspired by classical homeopathic traditions.

==Biography==
Born in Moseley, Worcestershire, he studied medicine at the University College Hospital, London, and obtained a Diploma of Public Health (DPH) at Cambridge.

In 1917 Bach had a malignant tumour removed from his spleen. It was predicted that he had only three months left to live, but instead he recovered. Bach died in his sleep on 27 November 1936 in Wallingford, Berkshire, at the age of 50.

Many of the Bach Flower remedies were designed whilst living in the Norfolk coastal town of Cromer in the 1930s.

==Bach nosodes==
Starting in 1919, he worked at the London Homeopathic Hospital, where he was influenced by the work of Samuel Hahnemann. In this period, he developed seven bacterial nosodes known as the seven Bach nosodes. Their use has been mostly confined to British homeopathy practitioners.

These bowel nosodes were introduced by Bach and the British homeopath John Paterson (1890–1954) and Charles Edwin Wheeler (1868–1946) in the 1920s. Their use is based on the variable bowel bacterial flora associated with persons of different homeopathic constitutional types.

==Bach flower remedies==

In 1930, at the age of 43, he decided to search for a new healing technique. He spent the spring and summer discovering and preparing new flower remedies – which include no part of the plant but simply what Bach claimed to be the pattern of energy of the flower. In the winter he treated patients free of charge.

Rather than being based on medical research, using the scientific method, Bach&#x27;s flower remedies were intuitively derived and based on his perceived psychic connections to the plants. If he felt a negative emotion, he would hold his hand over different plants, and if one alleviated the emotion, he would ascribe the power to heal that emotional problem to that plant. He believed that early morning sunlight passing through dew-drops on flower petals transferred the healing power of the flower onto the water, so he would collect the dew drops from the plants and preserve the dew with an equal amount of brandy to produce a mother tincture which would be further diluted before use. Later, he found that the amount of dew he could collect was not sufficient, so he would suspend flowers in spring water and allow the sun&#x27;s rays to pass through them.

While he recognised the role of the germ theory of disease, defective organs and/or tissue, and other known and demonstrable sources of disease, Bach wondered how exposure to a pathogen could make one person sick, while another was unaffected, when to all appearances and analysis they were in equal states of health. He postulated that illness was the result of a conflict between the purposes of the soul and the personality&#x27;s actions and outlooks. This internal war, according to Bach, leads to emotional imbalances and energetic blockage, which causes a lack of harmony, thus leading to physical diseases. Bach&#x27;s remedies focus on treatment of the patient&#x27;s personality, which he believed to be the ultimate root cause of disease.

<doc id="383135" wikidata="Q724156" url="?curid=383135" title="Cheddi Jagan">
<text>Cheddi Berret Jagan ( ; 22 March 1918 – 6 March 1997) was a Guyanese politician and dentist who was first elected Chief Minister in 1953 and later Premier of British Guiana from 1961 to 1964. He later served as President of Guyana from 1992 to his death in 1997. In 1953, he became the first Hindu and person of Indian descent to be a head of government outside of the Indian subcontinent.

Jagan founded the People&#x27;s Progressive Party along with his wife Janet and Forbes Burnham, and served as the first leader of the party. Jagan was a leading figure in the campaign for the independence of Guyana from the United Kingdom, and advocated for increased powers for trade unions at a time when British Guiana&#x27;s economy was dominated by powerful foreign enterprises. Jagan lost his position as Prime Minister to Forbes Burnham following the 1964 British Guiana general election, and Burnham would become Guyana&#x27;s first Head of Government following independence. 28 years later, Jagan was elected president in the 1992 Guyanese general election, which was regarded as the first &quot;free and fair&quot; election since 1964.

==Early life==
Cheddi Berret (Anglicized corruption of &quot;Bharat&quot;) Jagan was born on 22 March 1918 in Ankerville, Port Mourant, a rural village in the county of Berbice (present-day East Berbice-Corentyne). He was the eldest of 11 children. His parents were Indian Hindus who were Kurmis. They emigrated from British India to British Guiana as indentured labourers. They were both from the Basti district in the then North-Western Provinces in the Awadh and Bhojpuri regions of the Hindi Belt in North India (in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India). His mother Bachaoni came to British Guiana as a child with her mother, while his father Jagan also came as a child with his mother and brother. Both his mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s family immigrated to British Guiana aboard the &quot;Elbe&quot; in 1901; his father being two years old and his mother 18 months when they arrived. His father&#x27;s family were indentured to Albion Estate and his mother&#x27;s family was indentured to Port Mourant Estate under the management of J.C. Gibson.

The Jagan family lived in rural poverty, working in the cane fields to support themselves. His mother had worked on the estate till Jagan was nine years old. His father had worked his way up to become head driver on the estate, but it did not amount to much change in pay, and he had to retire at 50 due to ill health. Jagan received his primary education at Port Mourant Primary and the Rose Hall Scots School. He went on to pursue secondary education at R. N. Persaud&#x27;s private Secondary School. When Jagan was 15 years old, his father sent him to Queen&#x27;s College in the capital city of Georgetown (about away) for the next three years. Upon graduation, Jagan found his employment options in Guyana limited to agricultural work or converting to Christianity and becoming a teacher, so his father sent him to the United States to study dentistry with $500, the family&#x27;s life savings, so that he would not end up in the cane fields and he would not have to compromise his Hindu faith.

== Education and early career (1935–1946) ==
Jagan left for the United States in September 1935 or 1936 with two friends, and did not return to British Guiana until October 1943. He lived in Washington, D.C., for two years, enrolled in a pre-dental course at Howard University. To cover his expenses, Jagan took a job as an elevator operator. During the summers, he worked in New York City as a door-to-door salesman. Jagan&#x27;s performance helped him to win a scholarship for his second year at Howard. In 1938, he was admitted to the four-year dental program at the dental school at Northwestern University in Chicago. He graduated in 1942 with a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. From 1938 to 1942, Jagan was also enrolled at the Central YMCA College in Chicago and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree.

After returning to British Guiana, Jagan established a practice in Georgetown on 68 Main Street. During this time, he began to become politically engaged, and became involved with trade unions in the sugar industry. In 1945 he was made the treasurer of the Manpower Citizens&#x27; Association, though he was removed after a year after objecting to union policy.

==Political career==
=== Early political career (1946–1953)===
Jagan co-founded the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) in 1946 along with his wife, Janet, as well as H.J.M. Hubbard, and Ashton Chase. He was subsequently elected to the Legislative Council in November 1947 as an independent candidate from Central Demerara constituency. In 1949 Jagan became the president of the Sawmill Workers Union.

On 1 January 1950, the People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) was founded by a merger of the PAC and the British Guiana Labour Party (BGLP), with Jagan as its leader, former BGLP leader Forbes Burnham as its chairman and Jagan&#x27;s wife Janet as secretary.

The PPP quickly gained a mass following when they organised protests against the colonial administration, following an incident where colonial police shot dead five workers at Enmore sugar plantation in 1948 when they were participating in strike action.

=== Chief Minister of British Guiana for 133 days (1953)===
On 27 April 1953, Jagan won the 1953 British Guiana general election, with his PPP party winning 18 of 24 seats.

Jagan&#x27;s government immediately dissented against British rule. Jagan encouraged strike action against important sugar company Booker, refused to send a delegation to the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, repealed a law on &quot;undesirable publications&quot; passed by the colonial government, and repealed another law banning immigration of politically left-leaning individuals from the West Indies.

Taking place in the middle of Second Red Scare and McCarthyism, Jagan&#x27;s actions and policies led to British worries about a possible communist revolution in Guyana. Winston Churchill expressed fears that Jagan was a Marxist-Leninist, and claimed Jagan could allow the Soviet Union a foothold in South America, saying &quot;[W]e ought surely to get American support in doing all we can to break the Communist teeth in British Guiana … [P]erhaps they would even send Senator McCarthy down there.&quot; Declassified documents from MI5 show that the intelligence service concluded that the party were &quot;not receiving any financial support from any communist organisation outside the country&quot;. However, Jagan&#x27;s wife Janet may have been a member of the Young Communist League USA before she moved to Guyana.

On 8 October 1953, the PPP government passed the Labour Relations Act (modelled on the Wagner Act). The next day, on 9 October, the British administration suspended the constitution of British Guiana and troops were deployed. The queen had signed the order to dispatch troops on 4 October. On 9 October, a contingent of Royal Welsh Fusiliers arrived in Georgetown on HMS &quot;Superb&quot;, and Jagan was dismissed from his position and arrested. According to MI5, Jagan was unaware of the possibility of British intervention or of his arrest. Jagan appealed to British Labour leader Clement Attlee, who responded &quot;Regret impossible to intervene.&quot; Jagan was forced to resign as Chief Minister after 133 days. Britain installed an interim government.

===Interim Government (1953–1957)===
After the suspension of the constitution, Jagan departed for London with Forbes Burnham on 19 October 1953 to protest the suspension and attended the debate in the House of Commons on 21 October. During his time in the United Kingdom, both Jagan and Burnham were subject to covert surveillance by American and British intelligence services. He would subsequently arrive in India with Burnham on November 20, 1953, and meet Jawaharlal Nehru in an attempt to garner support.

Jagan&#x27;s movements were restricted to Georgetown from 1954 to 1957, and both him and his wife were closely monitored and kept under house arrest. During this period of time, colonial police would routinely raid the residences of senior members of the party to seize subversive literature. In 1954, Jagan was sentenced to 6 months in prison with hard labour for violating a restriction on his movement, travelling to the countryside and as a result leaving Georgetown. In court, Jagan likened British Guiana to a &quot;vast prison&quot;.

Senior member of the party Forbes Burnham split with Jagan politically in 1955, dividing the PPP into two separate factions named &quot;Burnhamite&quot; and &quot;Jaganite&quot;. These two factions in the PPP would both go on to contest the 1957 Guyanese election as PPP candidates. Burnham as a candidate was generally further to the right of the political spectrum. Support for the two factions followed mostly racial lines, as Burnham was the leading Afro-Guyanese figure in the PPP. However, the split was not entirely racial; prominent Afro-Guyanese politician Sydney King remained in the Jaganite faction, and Indo-Guyanese J.B. Lachmansingh supported Burnham. However, Sydney King and Afro-Guyanese Martin Carter and Rory Westmaas would both leave the party one year later due to being &quot;ultra-leftist&quot;. Clem Seecharan made the claim that they left because they believed that Jagan was compromising Marxist ideals for racial pragmatism (i.e., supporting Indo-Guyanese policies to appeal to his support base). This further reduced the number of active Afro-Guyanese politicians within the PPP.

===Minister of Trade and Industry (1957–1961)===

Jaganites won a majority of seats in the 1957 British Guiana general election winning 9 seats to the Burnhamite 3, and 2 seats for other parties. Following this outcome, the Burnhamite faction split entirely from the PPP, and Burnham founded the People&#x27;s National Congress (PNC). Jagan became minister of trade and industry, remained as PPP leader and was a member of the cabinet. He did not become Prime Minister during this time – there was no such position. The PPP government did not have possession of the Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs or Administration, and power resided mostly with the Governor, Ralph Grey.

During the lead-up and aftermath of the 1957 elections, Guyanese politics began to strongly follow racial lines. Jagan&#x27;s faction was majority Indo-Guayanese, and advocated for policies that would benefit mainly Indo-Guyanese, such as an increase in land for rice production and sugar industry reform through increased union powers. Jagan&#x27;s veto of West Indies Federation membership further alienated Afro-Guyanese voters- the Federation was majority Afro-Caribbean. Similarly, Burnham merged the PNC with the United Democratic Party to consolidate his grip on middle class Afro-Guyanese support. This style of politics along racial lines in Guyana became known as &quot;apan jhaat&quot;, which is Guyanese Hindustani for &quot;vote for your own kind&quot;.

===Premier of British Guiana (1961–1964)===

After a PPP victory in the August 1961 elections, Jagan became Premier, serving for three years. The elections were held as first-past-the-post, with 35 members of the Legislative assembly; the PPP won 20 seats, almost twice the number won by Burnham&#x27;s PNC, and 10 seats in the 13-seat senate, which led to mass demonstrations led by the PNC, a general strike and racially motivated violence. This violence would peak in early 1962, after Jagan&#x27;s government proposed what became known as the &quot;Kaldor Budget&quot;. Advised by economist Nicholas Kaldor, on 31 January 1962 the PPP government proposed an increase in tax and import duty which was opposed by opposition parties. The budget imposed austerity, the tax increases would have significantly impacted the Afro-Guyanese community, and the opposition was not consulted. However, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. expressed the opinion that the tax scheme was entirely orthodox and suitable for Britain, and the budget was praised by both the New York Times and the London Times. Following the budget, action was taken against the government, which culminated on 16 February 1962 in the destruction of 56 businesses, 87 businesses damaged by fire and 66 looted. One Police Superintendent was killed and 39 injured, Four looters shot and 41 injured. The rioters also attacked the Electricity Plant, the Water Works, Parliament, and Jagan&#x27;s residence. The British response was to send two warships, HMS &quot;Troubridge&quot; and HMS &quot;Wizard&quot;, to stop the violence. Jagan&#x27;s official residence suffered fire damage during the riots.

Following the 1961 elections, Jagan met John F. Kennedy in person in Washington, D.C., on October 25, and on December 18 he addressed the United Nations calling for a date for Independence from the United Kingdom.

The lead-up to the 1964 elections included a concerted effort by officials from the United States to ensure that Jagan did not win the election, due to fears about Jagan supposed communist views. A March 1961 CIA estimate opined that Jagan&#x27;s wife, Janet, was a communist, and that Jagan was under communist influence. Jagan had also expressed support and encouragement for the Cuban Revolution. The United Kingdom and United States differed on their opinions of how to solve the situation, with the British suggestion being that Jagan should be educated rather than removed from power. Jagan&#x27;s meeting with Kennedy in 1961 did not significantly change the American opinion of his political leanings. The Americans decided that Burnham&#x27;s policies were preferable to those of Jagan, and began to take actions against Jagan, including delaying independence from Britain, advocating a proportional representation electoral system which would be to the detriment of Jagan&#x27;s electoral chances, and providing support for strike action. These actions continued despite Jagan contacting Kennedy to protest his case. The CIA helped fund and organise the protests that led to the February 1962 demonstrations, and in April 1963 the CIA used $1 million of allocated funds to support the 80-day general strike. This strike action would later be cited as evidence that Jagan was not capable of governing British Guiana.

In October 1963, a constitutional conference was called. British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan summoned the three main Guyanese political leaders (Jagan, Forbes Burnham and Peter D&#x27;Aguiar) to London where Colonial Secretary Duncan Sandys announced the holding of fresh elections (previously the agreement was that independence would be granted before any further elections were called), a delay in the date of independence from 1963 to 1964, and a change in the electoral system from first-past-the-post to proportional representation. In a letter to President Kennedy, MacMillan explained that if Jagan refused to cooperate, Britain would suspend the constitution. Jagan agreed to elections in 1964 under proportional representation, but John Prados posits that this was only because he received assurances from Forbes Burnham that a coalition between the two parties would be acceptable. The Guiana United Muslim Party and Justice Party were both set up with the assistance of the CIA to split the Indo-Guyanese voting bloc, and the United States funded Burnham&#x27;s campaign activities against Jagan&#x27;s party.

The months preceding the December 1964 elections were marked with extensive civil disorder. Arson was a daily occurrence, nearly 200 people were murdered and 1000 were injured, and more than 15,000 people were forced from their homes. Violence came from both PPP and PNC supporters. On one occasion in August, a conference between the three political party leaders was interrupted when the PPP party headquarters was bombed on the same street. An article in Time Magazine accused Jagan of quietly encouraging the violence. There were multiple examples of racial violence across the country, including the fatal shooting of an elderly Afro-Guyanese couple on their farm, the death of a pregnant Indo-Guyanese woman at Bachelor&#x27;s Adventure near Enterprise and the deaths of four Indo-Guyanese at Afro-Guyanese hands in Wismar. Further violence included the sinking of the Sun Chapman on 6 July and the following murders of 5 Indo-Guyanese individuals at Mackenzie.

In the December 1964 elections, the PPP won a plurality of votes and actually increased their vote share to 46%, but Burnham&#x27;s party, the People&#x27;s National Congress, and the conservative United Force held a majority of seats and were invited to form the government by Governor Richard Luyt. However, Jagan refused to resign, and had to be removed by Luyt. Jagan would begin his role as leader of the opposition.

Clem Seecharan would later point to Jagan&#x27;s ideological inflexibility and his poor diplomatic handling of the electoral situation in Guyana as reasons for the strong American preference for Burnham over Jagan, and as a result Burnham becoming Guyana&#x27;s first leader after independence.

===Leader of the Opposition (1964–1992)===

Following Burnham&#x27;s election in 1964, a constitutional conference was held in London. Jagan refused to attend in protest at the imprisonment of PPP members at Mazaruni Prison. As agreed at the conference, Guyana gained independence from the United Kingdom on 26 May 1966. Jagan opposed this date for independence, as it was the anniversary of the Wismar Massacre of 1964. The same year, Jagan published &quot;The West On Trial: My Fight for Guyana&#x27;s Freedom&quot;, concerning his experience working towards Guyanese independence, which remains his most popular written work.

In 1965 Jagan attempted to enter the United States to join a protest against the Vietnam War but he was denied entry. He was again denied entry in 1967 to attend a planned speaking tour which had to be cancelled as a result.

He was elected as Leader of the Opposition and Minority Leader in 1966, and would remain in the role until 1973 when Marcellus Fielden Singh took over the role. He subsequently took the role again from 1976 until his election as president in 1992. During this time, Jagan would repeatedly protest at the authoritarian policies of Burnham&#x27;s administration, with electoral fraud being reported in 1968, 1973, 1980 and 1985.

In 1969, the People&#x27;s Progressive Party attended the 1969 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties, with Jagan attending personally. Jagan was subsequently elected General Secretary of the PPP.

In 1973, the PPP boycotted the National Assembly in protest at the fraudulent 1973 elections, and at the deaths of two Indo-Guyanese on election day. In 1974, a raid on Jagan&#x27;s home found parts of a revolver and he was charged with illegal possession.

Starting in 1975, the PPP began a period of closer collaboration with Burnham&#x27;s PNC, offering &quot;critical support&quot; when the PNC pushed for pro-socialist policies and was under the pressure of Venezuelan border claims, as well as proposing a national government with the PPP forming part of the ruling party in 1977. In 1978, Jagan was awarded the Order of Friendship of Peoples by the Soviet Union at the Kremlin.

The 1978 Guyanese constitutional referendum was strongly opposed by Jagan. The referendum would prolong the parliamentary term and would expand presidential powers. Jagan&#x27;s party led a boycott of the vote. The referendum passed with 97% of the vote, and the vote is considered to be fraudulent.

Following the death of Burnham in 1985, Desmond Hoyte came to power. Influenced by Jimmy Carter, Hoyte would put forward electoral reforms which would lead to the 1992 elections being internationally recognised as free and fair.

===President of Guyana (1992–1997)===
After 28 years in opposition, the PPP won the 5 October 1992 elections with about 54% of the vote, and Jagan became president. Contrary to earlier foreign fears, he governed as a democratic socialist and not a Marxist–Leninist. Jagan would pursue policies to attract foreign investors and move towards free market policies. Jagan also had a cordial relationship with the Clinton Administration in the United States, unlike his difficult relationship with Kennedy in the 1960s.

Following the previous administration, the Guyanese economy was still recovering from flawed economic policies and high national debt, and low prices for major Guyanese exports such as bauxite, oil and bananas. Jagan would pursue a policy of investment in national infrastructure, including sea defences, irrigation and drainage systems, road and bridge projects and investment in health, education and electricity generation. Jagan would also try to improve free trade in the Americas.

During his time in power, Jagan would advocate for a New Global Human Order. This proposal was aimed at the need for developing countries to acquire the means to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality. This involved debt relief, pollution tax, a Tobin tax on currency exchange and cuts in arms spending. These proposals did not gain significant support. Jagan announced this proposal in a speech at the United Nations in late 1995.

==Political opinions==
Jagan has been labelled as communist or Marxist by many different sources. Clem Seecharan said that the Jagan couple were both communists, although Cheddi was more ideological. In a discussion with V.S. Naipaul, Jagan elaborated on his appreciation of Marxist literature. Jagan also had regular communication with communist Billy Strachan. Political rival Forbes Burnham in 1957 classified Jagan and his allies as &quot;dogmatists whose aim is communism and who abuse everyone with whom they do not agree&quot;. In 1984, Jagan stated that &quot;I am not only fighting for the people of Guyana. I am fighting for the people of the world. I am contributing to that struggle. That struggle is winning. That is why the United States is so hysterical at the moment, because of that very fact, that what I stand for is winning&quot;. Jagan also went on to claim in 1990 that it was socialism in Eastern Europe which was failing, rather than communism, and stated that &quot;Communism, as a system, has not been tried in any country as yet, and remains a highly moralistic and humanistic ideal and destination.&quot; If Jagan was a Marxist, he would have been the first democratically elected Marxist in the Western Hemisphere, ahead of Chilean leader Salvador Allende.

Percy Hintzen stated that &quot;characterization of Jagan as a communist misses the complexity of his political philosophy… if Jagan was indeed a communist, it was certainly not reflected in the policies and programs that his party attempted to implement while in office.&quot; Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. said Jagan was not a communist, but rather a &quot;London School of Economics Marxist filled with charm.&quot;

== Personal life ==
After graduating from dental school in 1942, Jagan met Janet Rosenberg, a student nurse, in spring 1943. They married in 1943, and had two children: Nadira and Cheddi Jr. (who in turn produced five grandchildren).

Jagan and his wife shared a lifelong friendship with Billy Strachan, a leading British communist and a pioneer of black civil rights in Britain.

Janet Jagan followed her husband&#x27;s footsteps and held the positions of prime minister and president in 1997 (succeeded as president by Bharrat Jagdeo in 1999).

===Personality===
Clem Seecharan characterised Jagan as a man of integrity, &quot;who did not steal and never construed the political vocation as a means of amassing wealth&quot;. He would also label him as an &quot;attractive and incorruptible man&quot; known for his frugality. However, Seecharan would also accuse Jagan of ideological inflexibility and an &quot;apparent inability to comprehend or empathise with African insecurities&quot;. An article by Indo-Guyanese author Frank Birbalsingh also praised his integrity, pointing out that &quot;Never, in his half-century of involvement in politics, has anyone been able to point a finger at him, while charges of financial corruption, sexual misconduct or electoral fraudulence have been levelled at most of his contemporaries.&quot;

==Death==
Jagan suffered a heart attack on 15 February 1997 and was taken to Georgetown Hospital before being flown by U.S. military aircraft then by U.S. Air Force helicopter from Andrews Air Force Base to Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., later that day. He underwent heart surgery there and died in Washington on 6 March 1997, 16 days before his 79th birthday. Prime Minister Sam Hinds succeeded him as president and declared six days of mourning, describing Jagan as the &quot;greatest son and patriot that has ever walked this land&quot;. His funeral was postponed by a day to allow mourners time to visit who were caught in massive traffic jams, caused by the immense number of people traveling to Port Mourant for his funeral. More than 200,000 mourners attended. He had a state funeral in Georgetown and his cremation was at the Babu John (Jan) Crematorium in his hometown of Port Mourant. His final rites were done per Hindu customs and he was cremated on 12 March 1997. The site of his cremation became a &quot;samadhi&quot; (memorial) to him and later his wife, known as the Jagans&#x27; Memorial Monument.

==Legacy==
The People&#x27;s Progressive Party, which Jagan founded with Janet Jagan and Forbes Burnham, remains one of the two dominant political parties in Guyana, along with the PNC. Support for both groups continue to follow the racial divide between Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese. There are claims that Jagan may bear partial responsibility for the racial divide present in Guyanese politics. Walter Rodney said that &quot;...more than one political party has been responsible for the crisis of race relations on this country. I think our leadership has failed us on that score.&quot; Rodney also pointed to external intervention as a catalyst for poor race relations.

The Cheddi Jagan Research Centre in Georgetown commemorates his life and work, complete with a replication of his office. The centre is located in the Red House which served as Jagan&#x27;s official residence from 1961 to 1964. The Cheddi Jagan International Airport, the largest and primary international airport of the country, has been renamed after Jagan.

In 2007, Jagan was posthumously awarded the Order of Liberation of Guyana (OR). This award surpasses the Order of Excellence of Guyana, but was granted without an amendment to the constitution of orders and it does not appear in the list of national awards. Jagan also received the Order of the Companions of O.R. Tambo from South Africa in 2005.

Jagan&#x27;s wide regard as &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; in Guyana is stated by several different sources, including the Cheddi Jagan Research Centre, the Guyana Chronicle, the Times of India and important political figures in the PPP such as Irfaan Ali. In contrast, PNC member and at the time Minister of Social Cohesion Amna Ally in a 2015 speech named Forbes Burnham the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;.

<text>Newgate was one of the historic seven gates of the London Wall around the City of London and one of the six which date back to Roman times. Newgate lay on the west side of the wall and the road issuing from it headed over the River Fleet to Middlesex and western England. Beginning in the 12th century, parts of the gate buildings were used as a gaol, which later developed into Newgate Prison.

==Name==

It was once thought that Newgate was &quot;New&quot; since it was built after the Roman period, but archaeological evidence has shown that it was of Roman origin; it is therefore possible that the gate was named so when the Ludgate became less used, due to the building of the fourth St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the early medieval period. It was previously known as Chamberlains Gate, there was a landholding referred to as the Chamberlain&#x27;s Soke lying just outside Newgate, forming part of the ward of Farringdon Without.

==Structure and history==

Excavations in 1875, 1903 and 1909 revealed the Roman structure and showed that it consisted of a double roadway between two square flanking guardroom towers.

From the 12th century, the gate was used as a prison for debtors and felons. Jack Cade was beheaded publicly in Newgate after the conclusion of his failed rebellion. The notorious Newgate Prison, was later extended to the south on the site of the modern Central Criminal Court on Old Bailey. The gate was demolished in 1767.

==Communications and surrounding area==
Newgate Street, today part of the A40 London to Fishguard route, is mostly located within the city wall, leading west from Cheapside to the site of the old gate, and then continuing onto Holborn Viaduct at the point where the Old Bailey thoroughfare joins to the south and Giltspur Street to the north. A notable discovery here was a Roman tile inscribed with a disgruntled comment that &quot;Austalis has been going off on his own for 13 days&quot;. The Roman road continued along High Holborn and Oxford Street, via the Devil&#x27;s Highway to Silchester and Bath

To the north of the street are the public gardens around the ruins of Christ Church Greyfriars (bombed during World War II) on the site of a medieval Franciscan monastery. To the south is Paternoster Square leading towards St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

<doc id="383147" wikidata="Q443306" url="?curid=383147" title="Julian May">
<text>Julian Clare May (July 10, 1931 – October 17, 2017) was an American science fiction, fantasy, horror, science and children&#x27;s writer who also used several literary pseudonyms. She is best known for her &quot;Saga of Pliocene Exile&quot; (&quot;Saga of the Exiles&quot; in the United Kingdom) and &quot;Galactic Milieu Series&quot; books.

== Background and early career ==
Julian May grew up in Elmwood Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, the oldest of four children. Her parents were Matthew M. May (originally Majewski) and Julia Feilen May; as a child she was known as Judy May. 

She became involved in science fiction fandom in her late teens, publishing the fanzine &quot;Interim Newsletter&quot; for a time. She sold her first professional fiction, a short story called &quot;Dune Roller&quot;, in 1950 to John W. Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;; it appeared in 1951, under the name &quot;J. C. May&quot;, accompanied by her original illustrations. 

She met her future husband, Ted Dikty, later that year at a convention in Ohio. May chaired the Tenth World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago in 1952, becoming the first woman to chair a worldcon, and married Dikty in January, 1953. After selling one more short story, &quot;Star of Wonder&quot; (to Thrilling Wonder Stories in 1953), she dropped out of the science fiction field for several years.

== Period outside science fiction ==
May and Dikty had three children, the last of whom was born in 1958. Starting in 1954, May wrote thousands of science encyclopedia articles for Consolidated Book Publishers; after finishing that project, she wrote similar articles for two other encyclopedia publishers. In 1957 she and her husband founded a production and editorial service for small publishers, Publication Associates; the most notable projects May wrote and edited during this period include two episodes of the &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; comic strip and a new Catholic catechism for Franciscan Herald Press, a publisher associated with the Order of Friars Minor. Between 1956 and 1981 she wrote more than 250 books for children and young adults, most non-fiction, under her own name and a variety of pseudonyms; the subjects included science, history, and short biographies of modern-day celebrities such as athletes and musical groups.

&quot;Dune Roller&quot; was filmed in 1972 as &quot;The Cremators&quot;, in which she was credited as &quot;Judy Dikty&quot;.

== Return to science fiction ==
Having moved to Oregon in the early 1970s, May began to get reacquainted with the world of fandom; in 1976, she attended Westercon 29 in Los Angeles, her first science-fiction convention in many years. She made an elaborate diamond-encrusted &quot;space suit&quot; for the convention&#x27;s costume party, which started her thinking about what sort of character would wear such a suit. She soon began accumulating a folder of ideas for what would become the Galactic Milieu Series, and in 1978 she began writing what would become the &quot;Saga of Pliocene Exile&quot;. The first book in that series, &quot;The Many-Colored Land&quot;, was published in 1981 by Houghton Mifflin. In 1987, she continued the series with &quot;Intervention&quot;, finally followed in 1992 (with a change in publisher) by the Galactic Milieu Series: &quot;Jack the Bodiless&quot;, &quot;Diamond Mask&quot; and &quot;Magnificat&quot;.

In August 2015, she was inducted into the First Fandom Hall of Fame in a ceremony at the 73rd World Science Fiction Convention.

<doc id="383152" wikidata="Q431538" url="?curid=383152" title="Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown">
<text>John Alcock and Arthur Brown were British aviators who, in 1919, made the first non-stop transatlantic flight. They flew a modified First World War Vickers Vimy bomber from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, to Clifden, County Galway, Ireland. The Secretary of State for Air, Winston Churchill, presented them with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; prize of £10,000 () for the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by aeroplane in &quot;less than 72 consecutive hours&quot;. The flight carried nearly 200 letters, the first transatlantic airmail. The two aviators were knighted by King George V at Windsor Castle a week later.

==Background==
John Alcock was born in 1892 in Basford House on Seymour Grove, Firswood, Manchester, England. Known to his family and friends as &quot;Jack&quot;, he first became interested in flying at the age of seventeen and gained his pilot&#x27;s licence in November 1912. Alcock was a regular competitor in aircraft competitions at Hendon in 1913–14. He became a military pilot during the First World War and was taken prisoner in Turkey after his Handley Page bomber was shot down over the sea. After the war, Alcock wanted to continue his flying career and took up the challenge of attempting to be the first to fly directly across the Atlantic.

Arthur Whitten Brown was born in Glasgow, Scotland, with American parents in 1886 and shortly afterwards the family moved to Manchester. Known to his family and friends as &quot;Teddie&quot;, he began his career in engineering before the outbreak of the First World War.

In April 1913 the London newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; offered a prize of £10,000 to: 

The competition was suspended with the outbreak of war in 1914 but reopened after Armistice was declared in 1918.

Brown became a prisoner of war after being shot down over Germany. Alcock, too, was imprisoned and had resolved to fly the Atlantic one day. As Brown continued developing his aerial navigation skills, Alcock approached the Vickers engineering and aviation firm at Weybridge, who had considered entering their Vickers Vimy IV twin-engined bomber in the competition but had not yet found a pilot. The Vimy had originally been manufactured at Vickers in Crayford, the first twelve being made there and tested at Joyce Green airfield, Dartford. It was a great inconvenience to have to dismantle the aircraft to move them to Joyce Green so production was moved to Weybridge. The thirteenth Vimy assembled was the one used for the trans-Atlantic crossing. Alcock said 13 was his lucky number. Sir Henry Norman was involved in the detailed planning for a proposed transatlantic flight using the Vimy. This planning included the route to be flown, hangar facilities and the provision of the fuel needed.

Alcock&#x27;s enthusiasm impressed the Vickers&#x27; team and he was appointed as their pilot. Work began on converting the Vimy for the long flight, replacing the bomb racks with extra petrol tanks. Shortly afterwards, Brown, who was unemployed, approached Vickers seeking a post and his knowledge of long-distance navigation persuaded them to take him on as Alcock&#x27;s navigator.

==Flight ==


Several teams had entered the competition and, when Alcock and Brown arrived in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, the Handley Page team were in the final stages of testing their aircraft for the flight, but their leader, Admiral Mark Kerr, was determined not to take off until it was in perfect condition. The Vickers team quickly assembled their aircraft and, at around 1:45 p.m. on 14 June the Vimy took off from Lester&#x27;s Field. Alcock and Brown flew the modified Vickers Vimy, powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle 360 hp engines which were supported by an on-site Rolls-Royce team led by engineer Eric Platford. The pair brought toy cat mascots with them for the flight – Alcock had &#x27;Lucky Jim&#x27; while Brown had &#x27;Twinkletoes&#x27;.

It was not an easy flight. The heavily loaded aircraft had difficulty taking off from the rough field and only just cleared the tops of the trees.
At 17:20 the wind-driven electrical generator failed, depriving them of radio contact, their intercom and heating.
An exhaust pipe burst shortly afterwards, causing a frightening noise which made conversation impossible with a failed intercom.

At 5:00 p.m. they encountered thick fog, preventing Brown from being able to navigate using his sextant.
Blind flying in fog or cloud is hazardous without gyroscopic instruments, which they did not have. Alcock twice lost control of the aircraft and nearly hit the sea after a spiral dive. He also had to deal with a broken trim control which made the plane become very nose-heavy as fuel was consumed.

At 12:15 a.m., Brown got a glimpse of the stars and, able to use his sextant, found that they were on course. The generator had failed, denying power to their electric heating suits, leaving them very cold in the open cockpit.

Then, at 3:00 a.m., they flew into a large snowstorm. They were drenched by rain, their instruments iced up, and the aircraft was in danger of icing and becoming unflyable. The carburettors also iced up; it has been said that Brown had to climb out onto the wings to clear the engines, although he made no mention of that.

They made landfall in County Galway and landed at 8:40 a.m. on 15 June 1919, not far from their intended landing place, after less than sixteen hours&#x27; flying time.
The aircraft was damaged upon arrival because they landed on what appeared from the air to be a suitable green field, but which turned out to be Derrigimlagh Bog, near Clifden in County Galway in Ireland. This caused the aircraft to nose-over, although neither of the airmen was hurt.
Brown said that if the weather had been good, they could have pressed on to London.

Their altitude varied between sea level and 12,000 ft (3,700 m). They took off with 865 imperial gallons (3,900 L) of fuel. They crossed the coast at 4:28 pm, having spent around fourteen-and-a-half hours over the North Atlantic, flying 1,890 miles (3,040 km) in 15 hours 57 minutes at an average speed of 115 mph (185 km/h; 100 knots). Their first interview was given to Tom &#x27;Cork&#x27; Kenny of &quot;The Connacht Tribune&quot;.

Alcock and Brown were treated as heroes on the completion of their flight. Crowds in Ireland cheered them at each train station on their way to Dublin. Arriving in Britain by boat, they were mobbed at Holyhead, and planes escorted their train journey to London where a quarter of a million people lined the streets to watch their arrival. On the same day they landed, 15 June, the Secretary of State for Air, Winston Churchill, presented them with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; prize of £10,000 for their historic crossing of the Atlantic. In addition, Alcock received 2,000 guineas (£2,100) from the State Express Cigarette Company and £1,000 from Laurence R Philipps for being the first Briton to fly the Atlantic Ocean. Both men were knighted a week later by King George V at Windsor Castle.

Alcock and Brown flew to Manchester on 17 July 1919, where they were given a civic reception by the Lord Mayor and Corporation, and awards to mark their achievement. 

===Memorials===
Alcock was killed on 18 December 1919 when he crashed near Rouen whilst flying the new Vickers Viking amphibian to the Paris Airshow. Brown died on 4 October 1948.

Two memorials commemorating the flight are sited near the landing spot in County Galway, Ireland. The first is an isolated cairn four kilometres south of Clifden on the site of Marconi&#x27;s first transatlantic wireless station from which the aviators transmitted their success to London, and around from the spot where they landed. In addition, there is a sculpture of an aircraft&#x27;s tail fin on Errislannan Hill two kilometres north of their landing spot, dedicated on the fortieth anniversary of their landing, 15 June 1959.

Three monuments mark the flight&#x27;s starting point in Newfoundland. One was erected by the Government of Canada in 1952 at the junction of Lemarchant Road and Patrick Street in St. John&#x27;s, a second monument is located on Lemarchant Road, while the third was unveiled by Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador Joey Smallwood on Blackmarsh Road.

A memorial statue by sculptor William McMillan was erected at London Heathrow Airport in 1954 to celebrate their flight. The statue was taken to Ireland as part of the centenary celebrations in 2019 before being relocated at Brooklands Museum, where it was formally unveiled in February 2020. There is also a monument at Manchester Airport, less than 8 miles from John Alcock&#x27;s birthplace. Their aircraft (rebuilt by the Vickers Company) is located in the Science Museum in South Kensington, London.

The Royal Mail issued a 5d (approximately 2.1p in modern UK currency) stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of the flight on 2 April 1969. In June 2019, the Central Bank of Ireland issued 3,000 €15 silver commemorative coins, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the flight.

From April to October 2019 various events were held in Crayford and Bexley to commemorate the Centenary of the flight, and the visit of Alcock and Brown to Crayford in July 1919 when they were surprise guests at the reopening of The Princesses Theatre by the Duke of York (later King George VI). The events included talks, exhibitions, a celebration day at Hall Place and Gardens attended by c3,500 people, and chiefly a visit by the Duke of Kent to unveil a new bench in the centre of Crayford with a life-size Alcock and Brown seated at each end, and to view public artwork designed by local schools.

===Memorabilia===
On 19 March 2017 an edition of the &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; was broadcast in the UK in which the granddaughter of Alcock&#x27;s cousin presented a handwritten note which was carried by Alcock on the flight. The note, which was valued at £1,000–£1,200, read as follows:

==Other crossings==

Two weeks before Alcock and Brown&#x27;s flight, the first &#x27;stopping&#x27; flight of the Atlantic had been made by the NC-4, a United States Navy flying boat, commanded by Lt. Commander Albert Cushing Read, who flew from Naval Air Station Rockaway, New York to Plymouth with a crew of five, over 23 days, with six stops along the way. This flight was not eligible for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; prize since it took more than 72 consecutive hours and also because more than one aircraft was used in the attempt.

A month after Alcock and Brown&#x27;s achievement, British airship R34 made the first double crossing of the Atlantic. Leaving England on 2 July, it arrived on 4 July carrying 31 people (one a stowaway) and a cat. For the return flight, 29 of this crew, plus two flight engineers and a different American observer, returned to Europe.

On 2–3 July 2005, American adventurer Steve Fossett and co-pilot Mark Rebholz recreated the Alcock and Brown flight in a replica of the Vickers Vimy aeroplane. They did not land in the bog near Clifden, but a few miles away on the Connemara golf course.

A replica Vimy, NX71MY, was built in Australia and the US in 1994 for an American, Peter McMillan, who flew it from England to Australia with Australian Lang Kidby in 1994 to re-enact the first England-Australia flight by Ross &amp; Keith Smith with Vimy G-EAOU in 1919. In 1999, Mark Rebholz and John LaNoue re-enacted the first flight from London to Cape Town with this same replica, and in late 2006 the aeroplane was donated to Brooklands Museum at Weybridge, Surrey. After making a special Alcock and Brown 90th anniversary return visit to Clifden in June 2009 (flown by John Dodd and Clive Edwards), and some final public flying displays at the Goodwood Revival that September, the Vimy made its final flight on 15 November 2009 from Dunsfold Park to Brooklands crewed by John Dodd (pilot), Clive Edwards and Peter McMillan. It is now on public display as the centre-piece of a new &#x27;First to the Fastest&#x27; Transatlantic flight exhibition in the Museum&#x27;s Vimy Pavilion but is maintained as a &#x27;live&#x27; aeroplane and occasionally performs engine ground running demonstrations outside.

One of the propellers from the Vickers Vimy was given to Arthur Whitten Brown and hung for many years on the wall of his office in Swansea before he presented it to the RAF College Cranwell. It is believed to have been displayed in the RAF Careers Office in Holborn until 1990. It is believed to be in use today as a ceiling fan in Luigi Malone&#x27;s Restaurant in Cork, Ireland.

The other propeller, serial number G1184.N6, was originally given to the Vickers Works Manager at Brooklands, Percy Maxwell Muller and displayed for many years suspended inside the transatlantic terminal (Terminal 3) at London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport. In October 1990 it was donated by the BAA (via its former chairman, Sir Peter Masefield) to Brooklands Museum, where it is now displayed as part of a full-size Vimy wall mural in the Vickers Building.

A small amount of mail, 196 letters and a parcel, was carried on Alcock and Brown&#x27;s flight, the first time mail was carried by air across the ocean. The government of the Dominion of Newfoundland overprinted stamps for this carriage with the inscription &quot;Transatlantic air post 1919&quot;.

Upon landing in Paris after his own record-breaking flight in 1927, Charles Lindbergh told the crowd welcoming him that &quot;Alcock and Brown showed me the way!&quot;

===RAF 60th anniversary crossing in 1979===

To mark the original transatlantic crossing, on 1 June 1979 two Royal Air Force McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2s – XV424 (of No. 56 Squadron) and (RAF Coningsby based) XV486, were painted in special commemorative schemes. The scheme was designed by aviation artist Wilfred Hardy. As well as marking the anniversary of the crossing, the scheme also made reference to the usage of Rolls-Royce engines in both aircraft: the Rolls-Royce Eagle in the Vimy and the Rolls-Royce Spey in the Phantom FGR.2, and on top of this it also marked the 30th anniversary of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

It was decided that XV424 would make the flight and that XV486 would serve as backup. On 19 June, XV424 departed from RAF St. Athan to CFB Goose Bay from where the crossing would be made. The crew chosen for the crossing were: Squadron Leader A. J. N. &quot;Tony&quot; Alcock (pilot and nephew of Sir John Alcock who made the original crossing) and Flight Lieutenant W. N. &quot;Norman&quot; Browne (navigator). For the journey the pair took with them Brown&#x27;s original cat toy mascot &#x27;Twinkletoes.&#x27;

On 21 June, XV424 took off from Goose Bay, Labrador and began the crossing to Ireland. Flying subsonically the entire time, the journey took 5 hours and 40 minutes, setting The Phantom was refuelled five times throughout by Handley-Page Victor K.2 tankers of No. 57 Squadron. XV424 today is preserved at the RAF Museum in Hendon, sporting colours of No. 56 (Fighter) Squadron, while XV486 was scrapped in 1993.

The rear-wheel drive 510&#x27;s engineering was inspired by contemporary European sedans, particularly the 1966 BMW 1600-2 – incorporating an overhead camshaft engine and four-wheel independent suspension by means of MacPherson struts in front, and semi-trailing arms on the rear wheels. The styling is attributed to Datsun in-house designer, Teruo Uchino.

Nissan USA president Yutaka Katayama pushed for offering this generation of the Bluebird with a larger overhead cam engine with more power than the preceding models. The design originated with Prince Motor Company, which merged with Nissan in 1966. The Bluebird series had been Datsun&#x27;s smaller offering, but the 1966 introduction of the 1-litre Sunny allowed Nissan to move the Bluebird up into the mid-size category.

The 510-series Bluebird was released in the domestic Japanese market on August 15, 1967. In the United States, the Datsun 510 was launched in October 1967 as a four-door sedan, followed by a two-door sedan (June 1968), five-door station wagon, and two-door coupé (November 1968). In Canada it was sold as the Datsun 1600.

The range became famous for Nissan&#x27;s rallying successes outside Japan and paved the way for greater Nissan sales internationally.

The series was available with either a four-speed manual transmission or optional three-speed automatic. 510s, in some markets, offered twin Hitachi side-draft carburetors, which were a smaller version of the British SU design used on Jaguars and MGs. These engines also used enhanced compression and camshaft profiles to produce more power. SSS models (not offered in North America) offered upgraded instrumentation and interior trim, as well as appropriate exterior badges.

==Popularity==
Affordable performance combined with simple mechanicals helped the Datsun 510 remain a popular automotive enthusiast&#x27;s car for many years after its discontinuation. Avid collectors can be found around the world with significant numbers in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand.

One advantage of the early Datsun cars is that many of the parts were interchangeable – engines, transmissions, and suspension setups, for example, were all similar enough to swap with minor modifications. This allowed the Datsun 510 to be easily upgraded from the 1.6l – L16 engine, to the 1.8l – L18 engine, and later to the 2.0L L20B engine, and to go from the four-speed manual transmission to the 63 mm (shaft-center distance) five-speed transmissions made available for the early (S10) 200SX and (A10) HL510, and the 71 mm five-speed transmissions used in the (S30 &amp; S130) 280-series Z cars, 1980 to &#x27;83 (S110) 200SX, the 1977 to &#x27;80 (810) 810, the 1981 to &#x27;84 (910) 810/Maxima/Bluebird, and the C210/R30 series of Skylines. The 71 mm five-speed transmissions also saw extensive use in the 620/720/D21 series pick-up trucks in both long and short (rare) extension-housing versions.

Its positive reputation in North America also led to Nissan re-using the 510 model name there later on for the unrelated, 1978–1981 Nissan Stanza &#x27;A10&#x27; in an effort to capture this range&#x27;s glory - an effort reviewers considered a failure.

Hot Wheels manufactures several versions of the car.

==Variations and market differences==
The P510 (RHD) and PL510 (LHD) were the most prevalent models in many export markets, including the U.S. The 1969 KP510T two-door coupe version arrived in small numbers to right-hand-drive markets, predominantly Japan&#x27;s domestic market, unsaddled by engine emission regulations. The &quot;K&quot; prefix cars are coupés, with a swept roofline and shorter deck lid, while wagons carry a &quot;W&quot; prefix. For the 1974 model year, the 510 four-door sedan was dropped in favor of the 1974 PL610 series cars. Around the world, the &quot;J&quot; series pushrod-engined model was most common.

===Japan===
When first shown, at the 1967 Tokyo Motor Show, Japanese customers received the overhead-camshaft 1.3-liter engine with a claimed – according to Nissan, an engine more capable than competitor Toyota&#x27;s 1.5-liter version. The little engine was not helped by being married to a three-speed manual gearbox. From the beginning, however, North American customers received the larger 1.6 coupled to a four-speed all-synchro transmission. Indeed, by October 1968 the Bluebird was made available with a 1600 cc engine to Japanese buyers as well. The 510-series Bluebirds differed widely depending on the market. In South America, Asia (excluding Japan), and in Africa, the 510 sedan, and two-door models traded rear independent suspension for a leaf-sprung solid axle. (All station wagon models were equipped with a solid axle). The engines for these markets also differed. Rather than the OHC L-series, they received pushrod inline four-cylinder engines from the J-series with either 1.3 or 1.5-liter displacement. These variants were also known as Datsun 1500 (J15 engine) and Datsun 1300 (J13 engine).
In September 1970, the 1.3 and 1.5-liter engines were replaced with 1.4-liter units. In September 1971 the new, larger, Bluebird U (610) appeared in Japanese showrooms, but the 510 continued on sale as a lower-priced, more compact version. It also received a minor facelift with plastic surrounds for the headlamps, while the 1800 cc models were discontinued. The chassis code was changed to 510N.

===North America===
Originally only available as a four-door sedan or a station wagon for the 1968 model year, the two-door sedan saw a limited introduction during the summer of 1968 - making this the rarest U.S. 510 year and model. In Canada it was marketed as the Datsun 1600 rather than using the internal, &quot;510&quot; model code. The two-door sedan body style became popular and was imported into the U.S. and Canada in large numbers for the next five model years. The Datsun 510 released to the North American market had a Hitachi downdraft-carbureted 1.6-liter L-series straight-four engine, with an advertised gross power of , a claimed top speed of 100 mph, front disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension (MacPherson struts in front and semi-trailing arms in rear), except the wagons, which used a rear solid live axle with leaf springs.

The 1968 510s are unique, with a stainless steel grille, inward pivoting wipers, small amber front turn signals, no rear side marker lights, and different taillights from later models (without chrome trim). For 1969, the grille was changed and now has an unpainted, stainless steel central section with rounder bars than those found the year before. The wide &quot;DATSUN&quot; text was replaced with an upright rectangle with a &quot;D&quot; in the middle. The windshield wipers were changed for a more traditional layout and round side marker lights were added at the rear. Larger taillights, all red with a small, white reversing lamp, were introduced and remained until the end of production. The interior saw minor changes; most importantly the ignition was moved onto the steering column. All North American model 510s received tinted glass from 1970 on.

In Canada and the U.S., unitized-body Datsun PL510 cars have become rare in the Rust Belt regions, but can still be seen in areas where corrosive materials are not generally used on the roads- such as Western and Southern States. The greatest numbers of the cars seem to be in the West Coast region, where Japanese cars first succeeded in the market.

===Europe===
The first European imports were delivered shortly after the announcement of the car in Japan, spearhead the brand there. UK imports were announced at the October 1968 Motor Show. The L16 saloons appeared first, joined shortly by the estate. L13 models arrived in early 1969, and a series of minor updates and equipment changes dictated by the US market followed. The L14 model replaced the L13 in October, 1970, and was imported with the L16 until May, 1972, when the car was replaced by the far more successful (in the UK) 610. Nissan imported about 4,000 510 models into the UK. Nissan established a proper dealer network around the time the 510 was discontinued, (Octav Botnar was instrumental in the massive success of the brand in the UK) so the 510 never really received the marketing nor recognition that was achieved in other countries. All official imports in the UK were either four-door saloons or estates.

===Oceania===
Australian versions of the Datsun 1600 were delivered either as a full import (1967 and early 1969), or assembled in Australia from local and Japanese parts. These 510 Datsuns were equipped with &quot;L16&quot; engines. Australia officially received only the four-door sedan and station wagon models. The last of the P510 series went through Australian assembly lines in 1972, and due to the extensive use for rallying, the cars are now quite hard to find in any reasonable condition.

Nissan-Datsun New Zealand had the four-door manual sedans assembled locally from 1968, replacing two generations of Bluebirds (the name continued to be used in Japan and elsewhere) with the new 1600 export badge. Local content was about 40% and included glass, wiring, batteries, radiators, carpet and interior trim. Locally made radios were a dealer-fit accessory. The cars were built under contract at Campbell Motor Industries in Thames; the preceding Bluebird had been built at NZ Motor Bodies in Auckland. The 1968 1600s/510s had inward pivoting wipers and a rectangular speedometer; wipers soon were changed to a parallel action that cleared more glass, reversible for LHD versions. The 1970 facelift brought a new safety-style dashboard with recessed round dials, larger tail lamps with additional chrome trim in the lens, larger front combination lamps, increased bumper height, and detail changes to the grille. Automatic versions were a special import, built up, and only if (limited) import license was available, and a few SSS sedans were also imported fully assembled. The 1600, popular for modification and racing, not least due to its independent rear suspension (when contemporary rivals like the Ford Cortina and Toyota Corona had live, leaf-sprung rear axles), was replaced by the 180B in 1972, and was sought after used for many years afterwards.

===South America===
South American versions of the Datsun 510 were delivered with OHV pushrod engines of the J series variety and leaf spring suspensions (no IRS) on all models. Marketed as Datsun 1300 or Datsun 1500, depending on engine size.

===Taiwan===
The 510 was assembled in Taiwan as the Yue Loong Bluebird 706 and was powered by the &quot;J13&quot; from the 411 and had leaf spring rear suspension.

===South Africa===
The P510-series Datsun 1600 was built in South Africa in Pretoria between 1969 and 1974 with sedan or coupé bodywork. This generation marked the end of the &quot;Bluebird&quot; badge there. The sedan was available as a 1600 DeLuxe, 1600 SSS, 1600GL, 1600GL SSS (L16 engine) and later as the 1800GL and SSS They all had independent rear suspension and the SSS version, introduced in July 1969, had twin carbs. Coupé models were 1600 GL and 1800 GL. The SSS has SAE. These cars were very popular for motor sport in South Africa. The cars were used in numerous rallies by Ewold van Bergen from Pretoria, South Africa, who was a test engineer for Nissan Japan.

==Later years==
The Datsun 510 model name continued in Canada and the U.S. from 1974 until 1981, but the vehicles which wore the badge were quite different from the original flagship 510s, with updated styling, solid rear axles, and rectangular headlights. The 1981 model had a 2.0L (L20B) engine rated at 96 HP. In 1982 the 510 was replaced by the (Nissan) Stanza.

In 2013 and 2014, Nissan showed the Nissan Freeflow IDX and NISMO IDX at various auto shows, said to be influenced by the Datsun 510.

==Motorsport==

The 510 is best known in the United States for its competitiveness in the Trans Am Series under 2500cc class. John Morton won the 1971 and 1972 championships driving Pete Brock&#x27;s BRE Racing 510. The Datsun 510 remains one of the most popular production cars in numerous SCCA classes of amateur racing, partly due to Nissan Motor Corporation in USA&#x27;s commitment to providing an extensive selection of common replacement parts from its many area parts distribution centers, special replacement parts from their master parts distribution center (based in Los Angeles), as well as parts from Nissan Motorsports, Nissan&#x27;s performance division (based in Tennessee).
The Datsun 1600 was also very competitive in the Australian Rally Championship with outright and class wins throughout the 70s and the 80s and currently in historic classes.

<text>Information extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents and other electronically represented sources. Typically, this involves processing human language texts by means of natural language processing (NLP). Recent activities in multimedia document processing like automatic annotation and content extraction out of images/audio/video/documents could be seen as information extraction.

Recent advances in NLP techniques have allowed for significantly improved performance compared to previous years. An example is the extraction from newswire reports of corporate mergers, such as denoted by the formal relation: 
:formula_1,
from an online news sentence such as:
:&quot;Yesterday, New York based Foo Inc. announced their acquisition of Bar Corp.&quot;

A broad goal of IE is to allow computation to be done on the previously unstructured data. A more specific goal is to allow automated reasoning about the logical form of the input data. Structured data is semantically well-defined data from a chosen target domain, interpreted with respect to category and context.

Information extraction is the part of a greater puzzle which deals with the problem of devising automatic methods for text management, beyond its transmission, storage and display. The discipline of information retrieval (IR) has developed automatic methods, typically of a statistical flavor, for indexing large document collections and classifying documents. Another complementary approach is that of natural language processing (NLP) which has solved the problem of modelling human language processing with considerable success when taking into account the magnitude of the task. In terms of both difficulty and emphasis, IE deals with tasks in between both IR and NLP. In terms of input, IE assumes the existence of a set of documents in which each document follows a template, i.e. describes one or more entities or events in a manner that is similar to those in other documents but differing in the details. An example, consider a group of newswire articles on Latin American terrorism with each article presumed to be based upon one or more terroristic acts. We also define for any given IE task a template, which is a(or a set of) case frame(s) to hold the information contained in a single document. For the terrorism example, a template would have slots corresponding to the perpetrator, victim, and weapon of the terroristic act, and the date on which the event happened. An IE system for this problem is required to &quot;understand&quot; an attack article only enough to find data corresponding to the slots in this template.

==History==
Information extraction dates back to the late 1970s in the early days of NLP. An early commercial system from the mid-1980s was JASPER built for Reuters by the Carnegie Group Inc with the aim of providing real-time financial news to financial traders.

Beginning in 1987, IE was spurred by a series of Message Understanding Conferences. MUC is a competition-based conference that focused on the following domains: 
*MUC-1 (1987), MUC-3 (1989): Naval operations messages.
*MUC-3 (1991), MUC-4 (1992): Terrorism in Latin American countries.
*MUC-5 (1993): Joint ventures and microelectronics domain.
*MUC-6 (1995): News articles on management changes.
*MUC-7 (1998): Satellite launch reports.

Considerable support came from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), who wished to automate mundane tasks performed by government analysts, such as scanning newspapers for possible links to terrorism.

==Present significance==
The present significance of IE pertains to the growing amount of information available in unstructured form. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, refers to the existing Internet as the web of &quot;documents&quot; and advocates that more of the content be made available as a web of &quot;data&quot;. Until this transpires, the web largely consists of unstructured documents lacking semantic metadata. Knowledge contained within these documents can be made more accessible for machine processing by means of transformation into relational form, or by marking-up with XML tags. An intelligent agent monitoring a news data feed requires IE to transform unstructured data into something that can be reasoned with. A typical application of IE is to scan a set of documents written in a natural language and populate a database with the information extracted.

==Tasks and subtasks==
Applying information extraction to text is linked to the problem of text simplification in order to create a structured view of the information present in free text. The overall goal being to create a more easily machine-readable text to process the sentences. Typical IE tasks and subtasks include:

* Template filling: Extracting a fixed set of fields from a document, e.g. extract perpetrators, victims, time, etc. from a newspaper article about a terrorist attack.
** Event extraction: Given an input document, output zero or more event templates. For instance, a newspaper article might describe multiple terrorist attacks.
* Knowledge Base Population: Fill a database of facts given a set of documents. Typically the database is in the form of triplets, (entity 1, relation, entity 2), e.g. (Barack Obama, Spouse, Michelle Obama)
** Named entity recognition: recognition of known entity names (for people and organizations), place names, temporal expressions, and certain types of numerical expressions, by employing existing knowledge of the domain or information extracted from other sentences. Typically the recognition task involves assigning a unique identifier to the extracted entity. A simpler task is &quot;named entity detection&quot;, which aims at detecting entities without having any existing knowledge about the entity instances. For example, in processing the sentence &quot;M. Smith likes fishing&quot;, &quot;named entity detection&quot; would denote detecting that the phrase &quot;M. Smith&quot; does refer to a person, but without necessarily having (or using) any knowledge about a certain &quot;M. Smith&quot; who is (or, &quot;might be&quot;) the specific person whom that sentence is talking about.
** Coreference resolution: detection of coreference and anaphoric links between text entities. In IE tasks, this is typically restricted to finding links between previously extracted named entities. For example, &quot;International Business Machines&quot; and &quot;IBM&quot; refer to the same real-world entity. If we take the two sentences &quot;M. Smith likes fishing. But he doesn&#x27;t like biking&quot;, it would be beneficial to detect that &quot;he&quot; is referring to the previously detected person &quot;M. Smith&quot;.
** Relationship extraction: identification of relations between entities, such as:
*** PERSON works for ORGANIZATION (extracted from the sentence &quot;Bill works for IBM.&quot;)
*** PERSON located in LOCATION (extracted from the sentence &quot;Bill is in France.&quot;)
* Semi-structured information extraction which may refer to any IE that tries to restore some kind of information structure that has been lost through publication, such as:
** Table extraction: finding and extracting tables from documents.
** Table information extraction : extracting information in structured manner from the tables. This task is more complex than table extraction, as table extraction is only the first step, while understanding the roles of the cells, rows, columns, linking the information inside the table and understanding the information presented in the table are additional tasks necessary for table information extraction.
** Comments extraction : extracting comments from the actual content of articles in order to restore the link between authors of each of the sentences
* Language and vocabulary analysis
**Terminology extraction: finding the relevant terms for a given corpus
* Audio extraction
** Template-based music extraction: finding relevant characteristic in an audio signal taken from a given repertoire; for instance time indexes of occurrences of percussive sounds can be extracted in order to represent the essential rhythmic component of a music piece.

Note that this list is not exhaustive and that the exact meaning of IE activities is not commonly accepted and that many approaches combine multiple sub-tasks of IE in order to achieve a wider goal. Machine learning, statistical analysis and/or natural language processing are often used in IE.

IE on non-text documents is becoming an increasingly interesting topic in research, and information extracted from multimedia documents can now be expressed in a high level structure as it is done on text. This naturally leads to the fusion of extracted information from multiple kinds of documents and sources.

==World Wide Web applications==
IE has been the focus of the MUC conferences. The proliferation of the Web, however, intensified the need for developing IE systems that help people to cope with the enormous amount of data that are available online. Systems that perform IE from online text should meet the requirements of low cost, flexibility in development and easy adaptation to new domains. MUC systems fail to meet those criteria. Moreover, linguistic analysis performed for unstructured text does not exploit the HTML/XML tags and the layout formats that are available in online texts. As a result, less linguistically intensive approaches have been developed for IE on the Web using wrappers, which are sets of highly accurate rules that extract a particular page&#x27;s content. Manually developing wrappers has proved to be a time-consuming task, requiring a high level of expertise. Machine learning techniques, either supervised or unsupervised, have been used to induce such rules automatically.

&quot;Wrappers&quot; typically handle highly structured collections of web pages, such as product catalogs and telephone directories. They fail, however, when the text type is less structured, which is also common on the Web. Recent effort on &quot;adaptive information extraction&quot; motivates the development of IE systems that can handle different types of text, from well-structured to almost free text -where common wrappers fail- including mixed types. Such systems can exploit shallow natural language knowledge and thus can be also applied to less structured texts.

A recent development is Visual Information Extraction, that relies on rendering a webpage in a browser and creating rules based on the proximity of regions in the rendered web page. This helps in extracting entities from complex web pages that may exhibit a visual pattern, but lack a discernible pattern in the HTML source code.

==Approaches==
The following standard approaches are now widely accepted:
* Hand-written regular expressions (or nested group of regular expressions)
* Using classifiers
** Generative: naïve Bayes classifier
** Discriminative: maximum entropy models such as Multinomial logistic regression
* Sequence models
** Recurrent neural network
** Hidden Markov model
** Conditional Markov model (CMM) / Maximum-entropy Markov model (MEMM)
** Conditional random fields (CRF) are commonly used in conjunction with IE for tasks as varied as extracting information from research papers to extracting navigation instructions.

Numerous other approaches exist for IE including hybrid approaches that combine some of the standard approaches previously listed.

<text>Hwanghae Province (&quot;Hwanghae-do&quot; ) was one of the Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon era. Hwanghae was located in the northwest of Korea. The provincial capital was Haeju. The regional name for the province was Haesŏ, or Haeseo (). It is a region of Korea that occupies what is now North Hwanghae and South Hwanghae provinces of North Korea, as well as Baengnyeong Island and Ongjin County of South Korea.

==Etymology==
The name of the region, &quot;Haesŏ&quot;, means &quot;West of the Sea&quot;, in reference to the region being to the west of Gyeonggi Bay, the portion of the Yellow Sea offshore of Incheon and Ganghwa Island.
==History==

In 1395, the province was organized as Punghae (). In 1417, the province was renamed Hwanghae. The name derived from the names of the two principal cities of Hwangju () and Haeju ).

In 1895, the province was reorganized into the Districts of Haeju () in the west and Gaeseong () in the east, but in 1896, a new system of thirteen provinces was established, and Hwanghae Province was reconstituted.

In 1910, Korea was annexed into the Empire of Japan, and its administrative divisions were rearranged. Hwanghae Province was reorganized into Kōkai-dō, with Kaishū (Haeju) serving as its capital.

In 1945, Korea was divided into Soviet and American zones of occupation, north and south respectively of the 38th parallel. The southernmost part of Hwanghae (around the towns of Ongjin and Yonan County) was cut off from the rest of the province by the dividing line and joined Gyeonggi Province in the southern half of the country. In 1948, Hwanghae and Gyeonggi Provinces became parts of the new countries of North and South Korea respectively.

In 1953, at the end of the Korean War, the Northern Limit Line was established, which marked the maritime boundary between North and South Korea. The line runs between the mainland portion of Gyeonggi Province that had been part of Hwanghae before 1945, and the adjacent offshore islands (the largest of which is Baengnyeongdo). As a result, the mainland portion reverted to North Korean control, while the islands remained a part of South Korea. (Since 1999, North Korea has claimed a more southerly Maritime Military Demarcation Line, which would make the islands a part of North Korea as well. Disputes between North and South Korean naval vessels often occur in this area.)

In 1954, North Korea&#x27;s Hwanghae Province was divided into North and South Hwanghae Provinces.

==Geography==
Hwanghae was bounded by Pyeongan Province (after 1896 South Pyeongan) on the north, Gangwon Province on the east, Gyeonggi Province on the south, and the Yellow Sea on the west.

<text>The Pacific Surfliner is a passenger train service serving the communities on the coast of Southern California between San Diego and San Luis Obispo.

The &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; is Amtrak&#x27;s third-busiest service (exceeded in ridership only by the &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; and &quot;Acela&quot;), and the busiest outside the Northeast Corridor.

Like all regional trains in California, the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; is operated by a joint powers authority. The LOSSAN Rail Corridor Agency is governed by a board that includes eleven elected representatives from the six counties the train travels through. LOSSAN contracts with the Orange County Transportation Authority to provide day-to-day management of the service and with contracts with Amtrak to operate the service and maintain the rolling stock (locomotives and passenger cars). The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) provides the funding to operate the service and also owns all of the locomotives and some of the rolling stock; with Amtrak owning the rest.

Portions of the line in southern Orange County have been suspended four times between 2022 and 2024 due to coastal erosion.

== Operations ==

The San Luis Obispo–San Diego trip takes approximately 8 hours, 52 minutes at an average speed of ; maximum track speed is . Much of the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;″s scenic route follows the Pacific coast, with the tracks being less than from the ocean in some locations. Trains travel inland through expansive farmlands in Ventura County and industrial areas in the Los Angeles Basin, San Fernando Valley, and parts of Orange County.

, the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; operates ten daily round trips between Los Angeles and San Diego. Five round trips continue north of Los Angeles: two run all the way to San Luis Obispo, and three run to Goleta (near Santa Barbara), with Amtrak Thruway motorcoach service over the rest of the route to San Luis Obispo. Thruway motorcoach connections are also available to San Pedro; to Palm Springs and Indio; and to San Jose or Oakland (with connections to &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; trains) via Paso Robles.

Because the stations at the ends of the line do not have wyes to turn equipment, trains are operated in push-pull mode. The locomotive is at the rear of the train, pushing the train from Goleta, San Luis Obispo or San Diego to Los Angeles. At Los Angeles, the train reverses at the station, and the locomotive pulls the train to San Diego or Goleta/San Luis Obispo, respectively. Run-through tracks are under construction at Union Station in Los Angeles to ease congestion and reduce time spent waiting to enter or depart the station. The ongoing North Coast Corridor project plans to increase rail capacity on the route of the Surfliner in North San Diego County.
=== LOSSAN Rail Corridor Agency ===
Local agencies along with the host railroads formed the Los Angeles–San Diego-San Luis Obispo Rail Corridor Agency (LOSSAN) in 1989. The &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; is operated by Amtrak under the Amtrak California brand with funding provided by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Serious discussions were held in 2009 regarding the local agencies administering the service rather than Caltrans. California Senate Bill No. 1225, passed in 2014, allowed LOSSAN to amend the joint powers agreement and become the sponsor of state-supported intercity passenger rail service in the corridor. In mid-2015, LOSSAN assumed oversight for the Surfliner. They are also working with Caltrans to assess rail operations from Los Angeles to San Diego to develop better connections, close gaps in the schedule, and optimize the assets of the railroad.

== History ==

The route is the successor of the &quot;San Diegan,&quot; a Los Angeles–San Diego service operated since 1938 by the Santa Fe Railway. It had been one of the Santa Fe&#x27;s premier routes until Amtrak took over operations in 1971. Initially there were three daily trips, but the schedule was expanded to six round trips during the 1970s with funding from the state of California. In 1988 the service was extended to Santa Barbara to provide the Central Coast with an additional train to Los Angeles, followed in 1995 with one trip a day going all the way to San Luis Obispo. To better reflect the route&#x27;s extent, it was renamed the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; in 2000. The route is named after the Surf Line, which now comprises the route&#x27;s busiest section from Los Angeles to San Diego.

A stop at Old Town Transit Center was added in 2004. Stops at Orange and Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo were added in 2007 but dropped in 2012. On October 7, 2013, stops were added at Coaster stations at Carlsbad Village, Carlsbad Poinsettia, Encinitas and Sorrento Valley. The Carlsbad Poinsettia and Encinitas stops were dropped on October 9, 2017, due to low ridership. The Carlsbad Village and Sorrento Valley stops were dropped on October 8, 2018, due to changes with the cross-ticketing arrangement with Coaster. A 13th daily round trip was added on October 14, 2019.

On September 30, 2022, all rail service between and was suspended due to coastal erosion under the track in San Clemente. Emergency repairs were expected to take at least 90 days. Full &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; service resumed on April 17, 2023. Service south of Irvine was again suspended on April 27 due to further erosion at Casa Romantica. Service resumed on May 27, 2023. Service was suspended again on June 5 due to continued erosion at Casa Romantica and resumed on July 19. Service was suspended on January 25, 2024, due to a landslide at San Clemente. The state declared an emergency on February 1, allowing the Orange County Transportation Authority to access emergency funding. Limited service through the landslide area resumed on March 6, 2024, followed by full service on March 25.

In January 2025, LOSSAN was awarded a $27 million federal grant that will fund restoration of the 11th, 12th, and 13th daily round trips, resuming pre-pandemic frequency. The 11th and 12th round trips were expected to resume in March 2025, followed by the 13th in November.
== Route ==

The &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; runs on track owned by several private railroads and public agencies:
* Union Pacific Railroad (Coast Line): San Luis Obispo – Moorpark
* Southern California Regional Rail Authority: Moorpark – Los Angeles
* BNSF Railway: Los Angeles – Fullerton
* Southern California Regional Rail Authority: Fullerton – Orange County/San Diego County line
* North County Transit District: Orange County/San Diego County line – San Diego

== Stations ==

, , and stations were previously served under the &quot;Rail 2 Rail&quot; reciprocal pass program with Coaster, while and were served under a similar program with Metrolink.

== Rolling stock ==

The &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; uses push-pull trainsets with a diesel locomotive at one end and a cab car at the other. The COVID-19 pandemic saw a reduction in service from ten trainsets operating 27 daily trains to seven trainsets operating 20 daily trains.

Trainsets used for regular service are composed from a fleet of 52 bi-level Surfliner coaches (39 owned by Amtrak and 13 by Caltrans), plus nine leased Amtrak Superliner long-distance coaches modified for push-pull operation. These Superliners are called flex cars, as they can be used for additional business class or coach seating, depending on the demand.

A typical six-car set has a business class car; one Superliner car; two coach cars; a coach/café car with food sales on the lower level; and a coach/baggage/cab car equipped with coach seating, a checked baggage space on the lower level, and engineer&#x27;s operating cab. 

LOSSAN has expressed interest in acquiring bi-level cars from a variety of sources, such as purchasing Surfliner and Superliner cars from Amtrak, as well as receiving bi-level cars from other Amtrak California services.

The Surfliner cars were introduced in 2000–02, and were designed specifically to handle the demands of the nation&#x27;s third-busiest rail line. They replaced the California Cars which had been introduced on the &quot;San Diegan&quot; in 1996, and had been fraught with problems in the latter part of the 1990s.

A dedicated fleet of 16 Caltrans-owned Siemens Charger locomotives began entering service in late 2018. The Chargers replaced a fleet of 15 Amtrak-owned EMD F59PHI locomotives, which were sold to Metra in 2019.

The Surfliner cars and Charger locomotives (and previously the F59PHI locomotives) are painted in a blue and silver livery that is unique to the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;.

Additional Amtrak-owned cars are added (up to 12-car consists) during periods of high demand, including San Diego Comic-Con, the San Diego County Fair, events at the Del Mar Racetrack, and after the 2018 Southern California mudflows closed Highway 101.

<text>Tiles are usually thin, square or rectangular coverings manufactured from hard-wearing material such as ceramic, stone, metal, baked clay, or even glass. They are generally fixed in place in an array to cover roofs, floors, walls, edges, or other objects such as tabletops. Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as perlite, wood, and mineral wool, typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a tile is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see tile-based game). The word is derived from the French word &quot;tuile&quot;, which is, in turn, from the Latin word &quot;tegula&quot;, meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.

Tiles are often used to form wall and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex or mosaics. Tiles are most often made of ceramic, typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, concrete and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.

Global production of ceramic tiles, excluding roof tiles, was estimated to be 12.7 billion m2 in 2019.

== Decorative tile work and colored brick ==
Decorative tilework or tile art should be distinguished from mosaic, where forms are made of great numbers of tiny irregularly positioned tesserae, each of a single color, usually of glass or sometimes ceramic or stone. There are various tile patterns, such as herringbone, staggered, offset, grid, stacked, pinwheel, &quot;parquet de Versailles&quot;, basket weave, tiles Art, diagonal, chevron, and encaustic which can range in size, shape, thickness, and color.

== History ==
There are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example the small, almost mosaic, brightly colored &quot;zellij&quot; tiles of Morocco and the surrounding countries.

===Ancient Middle East===
The earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the Elamite Temple at Chogha Zanbil, dated to the 13th century BC. Glazed and colored bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient Mesopotamia, most famously the Ishtar Gate of Babylon (), now partly reconstructed in Berlin, with sections elsewhere. Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the Persian Empire such as Persepolis.

The use of sun-dried bricks or adobe was the main method of building in Mesopotamia where river mud was found in abundance along the Tigris and Euphrates. Here the scarcity of stone may have been an incentive to develop the technology of making kiln-fired bricks to use as an alternative. To strengthen walls made from sun-dried bricks, fired bricks began to be used as an outer protective skin for more important buildings like temples, palaces, city walls, and gates. Making fired bricks is an advanced pottery technique. Fired bricks are solid masses of clay heated in kilns to temperatures of between 950° and 1,150°C, and a well-made fired brick is an extremely durable object. Like sun-dried bricks, they were made in wooden molds but for bricks with relief decorations, special molds had to be made.

=== Ancient Indian subcontinent ===
Rooms with tiled floors made of clay decorated with geometric circular patterns have been discovered from the ancient remains of Kalibangan, Balakot and Ahladino.

Tiling was used in the second century by the Sinhalese kings of ancient Sri Lanka, using smoothed and polished stone laid on floors and in swimming pools. The techniques and tools for tiling is advanced, evidenced by the fine workmanship and close fit of the tiles. Such tiling can be seen in Ruwanwelisaya and Kuttam Pokuna in the city of Anuradhapura. The nine-storied &quot;Lovamahapaya&quot; (3rd century BC) had copper roof tiles. The roofs were tiled, with red, white, yellow, turquoise and brown tiles. There were also tiles made of bronze. Sigiriya also had an elaborate gatehouse made of timber and brick masonry with multiple tiled roofs. The massive timber doorposts remaining today indicate this.

=== Ancient Iran ===
The Achaemenid Empire decorated buildings with glazed brick tiles, including Darius the Great&#x27;s palace at Susa, and buildings at Persepolis. The succeeding Sassanid Empire used tiles patterned with geometric designs, flowers, plants, birds and human beings, glazed up to a centimeter thick.

=== Islamic ===

Early Islamic mosaics in Iran consist mainly of geometric decorations in mosques and mausoleums, made of glazed brick. Typical, turquoise, tiling becomes popular in 10th-11th century and is used mostly for Kufic inscriptions on mosque walls. Seyyed Mosque in Isfahan (AD 1122), Dome of Maraqeh (AD 1147) and the Jame Mosque of Gonabad (1212 AD) are among the finest examples. The dome of Jame&#x27; Atiq Mosque of Qazvin is also dated to this period.
The golden age of Persian tilework began during the Timurid Empire. In the moraq technique, single-color tiles were cut into small geometric pieces and assembled by pouring liquid plaster between them. After hardening, these panels were assembled on the walls of buildings. But the mosaic was not limited to flat areas. Tiles were used to cover both the interior and exterior surfaces of domes. Prominent Timurid examples of this technique include the Jame Mosque of Yazd (AD 1324–1365), Goharshad Mosque (AD 1418), the Madrassa of Khan in Shiraz (AD 1615), and the Molana Mosque (AD 1444).

Other important tile techniques of this time include girih tiles, with their characteristic white girih, or straps.

Mihrabs, being the focal points of mosques, were usually the places where most sophisticated tilework was placed. The 14th-century mihrab at Madrasa Imami in Isfahan is an outstanding example of aesthetic union between the Islamic calligrapher&#x27;s art and abstract ornament. The pointed arch, framing the mihrab&#x27;s niche, bears an inscription in Kufic script used in 9th-century Qur&#x27;an.

One of the best known architectural masterpieces of Iran is the Shah Mosque in Isfahan, from the 17th century. Its dome is a prime example of tile mosaic and its winter praying hall houses one of the finest ensembles of &quot;cuerda seca&quot; tiles in the world. A wide variety of tiles had to be manufactured in order to cover complex forms of the hall with consistent mosaic patterns. The result was a technological triumph as well as a dazzling display of abstract ornament.

During the Safavid period, mosaic ornaments were often replaced by a &quot;haft rang&quot; (seven colors) technique. Pictures were painted on plain rectangle tiles, glazed and fired afterwards. Besides economic reasons, the seven colors method gave more freedom to artists and was less time-consuming. It was popular until the Qajar period, when the palette of colors was extended by yellow and orange. The seven colors of Haft Rang tiles were usually black, white, ultramarine, turquoise, red, yellow and fawn.

The Persianate tradition continued and spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the İznik pottery of Turkey under the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries. Palaces, public buildings, mosques and türbe mausoleums were heavily decorated with large brightly colored patterns, typically with floral motifs, and friezes of astonishing complexity, including floral motifs and calligraphy as well as geometric patterns.

Islamic buildings in Bukhara in central Asia (16th-17th century) also exhibit very sophisticated floral ornaments. In South Asia monuments and shrines adorned with Kashi tile work from Persia became a distinct feature of the shrines of Multan and Sindh. The Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore stands out as one of the masterpieces of Kashi time work from the Mughal period.

The &quot;zellige&quot; tradition of Arabic North Africa uses small colored tiles of various shapes to make very complex geometric patterns. It is halfway to mosaic, but as the different shapes must be fitted precisely together, it falls under tiling. The use of small coloured glass fields also make it rather like enamelling, but with ceramic rather than metal as the support.

===Europe===

Medieval Europe made considerable use of painted tiles, sometimes producing very elaborate schemes, of which few have survived. Religious and secular stories were depicted. The imaginary tiles with Old Testament scenes shown on the floor in Jan van Eyck&#x27;s 1434 &quot;Annunciation&quot; in Washington are an example. The 14th century &quot;Tring tiles&quot; in the British Museum show childhood scenes from the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, possibly for a wall rather than a floor, while their 13th century &quot;Chertsey Tiles&quot;, though from an abbey, show scenes of Richard the Lionheart battling with Saladin in very high-quality work. Medieval letter tiles were used to create Christian inscriptions on church floors.

Medieval influences between Middle Eastern tilework and tilework in Europe were mainly through Islamic Iberia and the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires. The Alhambra &quot;zellige&quot; are said to have inspired the tessellations of M. C. Escher. Medieval encaustic tiles were made of multiple colours of clay, shaped and baked together to form a pattern that, rather than sitting on the surface, ran right through the thickness of the tile, and thus would not wear away.
&quot;Azulejos&quot; are derived from &quot;zellij&quot;, and the name is likewise derived. The term is both a simple Portuguese and Spanish term for zellige, and a term for later tilework following the tradition. Some &quot;azujelos&quot; are small-scale geometric patterns or vegetative motifs, some are blue monochrome and highly pictorial, and some are neither. The Baroque period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white, for walls. &quot;Azulejos&quot; were also used in Latin American architecture.


Delftware wall tiles, typically with a painted design covering only one (rather small) blue and white tile, were ubiquitous in Holland and widely exported over Northern Europe from the 16th century on, replacing many local industries. Several 18th century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain in tiles or panels. Surviving examples include ones at Capodimonte, Naples, the Royal Palace of Madrid and the nearby Royal Palace of Aranjuez.
The Victorian period saw a great revival in tilework, largely as part of the Gothic Revival, but also the Arts and Crafts Movement. Patterned tiles, or tiles making up patterns, were now mass-produced by machine and reliably level for floors and cheap to produce, especially for churches, schools and public buildings, but also for domestic hallways and bathrooms. For many uses the tougher encaustic tile was used. Wall tiles in various styles also revived; the rise of the bathroom contributing greatly to this, as well as greater appreciation of the benefit of hygiene in kitchens. William De Morgan was the leading English designer working in tiles, strongly influenced by Islamic designs.

Since the Victorian period tiles have remained standard for kitchens and bathrooms, and many types of public area.

&quot;Panot&quot; is a type of outdoor cement tile and the associated paving style, both found in Barcelona. In 2010, around of Barcelona streets were panot-tiled.

Portugal and São Luís continue their tradition of &quot;azulejo&quot; tilework today, with tiles used to decorate buildings, ships, and even rocks.

=== Far East ===
With exceptions, notably the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, decorated tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics.

Philippines

In 17th AD during the colonialization of Spain in the Philippines, they introduced the Baldozas Mosaicos to describe the Mediterranean cement tiles, but they are now more commonly referred to as Machuca tiles during the 19th AD, named after Don Pepe, the son of the renowned producer of Baldozas Mosaicos in the Philippines, Don Jose Machuca by Romero

== Roof tiles ==

Roof tiles are overlapping tiles designed mainly to keep out precipitation such as rain or snow, and are traditionally made from locally available materials such as clay or slate. Later tiles have been made from materials such as concrete, and plastic.

Roof tiles can be affixed by screws or nails, but in some cases historic designs such as &quot;Marseilles&quot; tiles utilize interlocking systems that can be self-supporting. Tiles typically cover an underlayment system, which seals the roof against water intrusion.

Clay roof tiles historically gained their color purely from the clay that they were composed of, resulting in largely red, orange, and tan colored roofs. Over time some cultures, notably in Asia, began to apply glazes to clay tiles, achieving a wide variety of colors and combinations. Modern clay roof tiles typically source their color from kiln firing conditions, the application of glaze, or the use of a ceramic engobe. Contrary to popular belief a glaze does not weatherproof a tile, the porosity of the clay body is what determines how well a tile will survive harsh weather conditions.

== Floor tiles ==




Floor tiles are commonly made of ceramic or stone, although recent technological advances have resulted in rubber or glass tiles for floors as well. Ceramic tiles may be painted and glazed. Small mosaic tiles may be laid in various patterns. Floor tiles are typically set into mortar consisting of sand, Portland cement and often a latex additive. The spaces between the tiles are commonly filled with sanded or unsanded floor grout, but traditionally mortar was used.

Natural stone tiles can be beautiful but as a natural product they are less uniform in color and pattern, and require more planning for use and installation. Mass-produced stone tiles are uniform in width and length. Granite or marble tiles are sawn on both sides and then polished or finished on the top surface so that they have a uniform thickness. Other natural stone tiles such as slate are typically &quot;riven&quot; (split) on the top surface so that the thickness of the tile varies slightly from one spot on the tile to another and from one tile to another. Variations in tile thickness can be handled by adjusting the amount of mortar under each part of the tile, by using wide grout lines that &quot;ramp&quot; between different thicknesses, or by using a cold chisel to knock off high spots.

Some stone tiles such as polished granite, marble, and travertine are very slippery when wet. Stone tiles with a riven surface such as slate or with a sawn and then sandblasted or honed surface will be more slip-resistant. Ceramic tiles for use in wet areas can be made more slip-resistant by using very small tiles so that the grout lines acts as grooves, by imprinting a contour pattern onto the face of the tile, or by adding a non-slip material, such as sand, to the glazed surface.

The hardness of natural stone tiles varies such that some of the softer stone (e.g. limestone) tiles are not suitable for very heavy-traffic floor areas. On the other hand, ceramic tiles typically have a glazed upper surface and when that becomes scratched or pitted the floor looks worn, whereas the same amount of wear on natural stone tiles will not show, or will be less noticeable.

Natural stone tiles can be stained by spilled liquids; they must be sealed and periodically resealed with a sealant in contrast to ceramic tiles which only need their grout lines sealed. However, because of the complex, nonrepeating patterns in natural stone, small amounts of dirt on many natural stone floor tiles do not show.

The tendency of floor tiles to stain depends not only on a sealant being applied, and periodically reapplied, but also on their porosity or how porous the stone is. Slate is an example of a less porous stone while limestone is an example of a more porous stone. Different granites and marbles have different porosities with the less porous ones being more valued and more expensive.

Most vendors of stone tiles emphasize that there will be variation in color and pattern from one batch of tiles to another of the same description and variation within the same batch. Stone floor tiles tend to be heavier than ceramic tiles and somewhat more prone to breakage during shipment.

Rubber floor tiles have a variety of uses, both in residential and commercial settings. They are especially useful in situations where it is desired to have high-traction floors or protection for an easily breakable floor. Some common uses include flooring of garage, workshops, patios, swimming pool decks, sport courts, gyms, and dance floors.

Plastic floor tiles including interlocking floor tiles that can be installed without adhesive or glue are a recent innovation and are suitable for areas subject to heavy traffic, wet areas and floors that are subject to movement, damp or contamination from oil, grease or other substances that may prevent adhesion to the substrate. Common uses include old factory floors, garages, gyms and sports complexes, schools and shops.

== Ceiling tiles ==

Ceiling tiles are lightweight tiles used inside buildings. They are placed in an aluminium grid; they provide little thermal insulation but are generally designed either to improve the acoustics of a room or to reduce the volume of air being heated or cooled.

Mineral fiber tiles are fabricated from a range of products; wet felt tiles can be manufactured from perlite, mineral wool, and fibers from recycled paper; stone wool tiles are created by combining molten stone and binders which is then spun to create the tile; gypsum tiles are based on the soft mineral and then finished with vinyl, paper or a decorative face.

Ceiling tiles very often have patterns on the front face; these are there in most circumstances to aid with the tiles ability to improve acoustics.

Ceiling tiles also provide a barrier to the spread of smoke and fire. Breaking, displacing, or removing ceiling tiles enables hot gases and smoke from a fire to rise and accumulate above detectors and sprinklers. Doing so delays their activation, enabling fires to grow more rapidly.

Ceiling tiles, especially in old Mediterranean houses, were made of terracotta and were placed on top of the wooden ceiling beams and upon those were placed the roof tiles. They were then plastered or painted, but nowadays are usually left bare for decorative purposes.

Modern-day tile ceilings may be flush mounted (nail up or glue up) or installed as dropped ceilings.

== Materials and processes ==
=== Ceramic ===
Ceramic materials for tiles include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. Terracotta is a traditional material used for roof tiles.

==== Porcelain tiles ====
This is a US term, and defined in ASTM standard C242 as a ceramic mosaic tile or paver that is generally made by dust-pressing and of a composition yielding a tile that is dense, fine-grained, and smooth, with sharply-formed face, usually impervious. The colours of such tiles are generally clear and bright.

The ISO 13006 defines a &quot;porcelain tile&quot; as a &quot;fully vitrified tile with water absorption less than or equal to 0.5%, belonging to groups AIa and BIa (of ISO 13006).&quot;. The ANSI defines as &quot;a ceramic tile that has &#x27;a water absorption of 0.5%&#x27; or less.” It is made generally by the pressed or extruded method.&quot;

=== Pebble ===

Similar to mosaics or other patterned tiles, pebble tiles are tiles made up of small pebbles attached to a backing. The tile is generally designed in an interlocking pattern so that final installations fit of multiple tiles fit together to have a seamless appearance. A relatively new tile design, pebble tiles were originally developed in Indonesia using pebbles found in various locations in the country. Today, pebble tiles feature all types of stones and pebbles from around the world.

=== Digital printed ===
Printing techniques and digital manipulation of art and photography are used in what is known as &quot;custom tile printing&quot;. Dye sublimation printers, inkjet printers and ceramic inks and toners permit printing on a variety of tile types yielding photographic-quality reproduction. Using digital image capture via scanning or digital cameras, bitmap/raster images can be prepared in photo editing software programs. Specialized custom-tile printing techniques permit transfer under heat and pressure or the use of high temperature kilns to fuse the picture to the tile substrate. This has become a method of producing custom tile murals for kitchens, showers, and commercial decoration in restaurants, hotels, and corporate lobbies.

 Recent technology applied to Digital ceramic and porcelain printers allow images to be printed with a wider color gamut and greater color stability even when fired in a kiln up to 2200 °F.

=== Diamond etched ===
A method for custom tile printing involving a diamond-tipped drill controlled by a computer. Compared with the laser engravings, diamond etching is in almost every circumstance more permanent.

== Mathematics of tiling ==

Certain shapes of tiles, most obviously rectangles, can be replicated to cover a surface with no gaps. These shapes are said to &quot;tessellate&quot; (from the Latin &quot;tessella&quot;, &#x27;tile&#x27;) and such a tiling is called a tessellation. Geometric patterns of some Islamic polychrome decorative tilings are rather complicated (see Islamic geometric patterns and, in particular, Girih tiles), even up to supposedly quaziperiodic ones, similar to Penrose tilings.

<text>Mitel Networks Corporation is a Canadian telecommunications company. The company previously produced TDM PBX systems and applications, but after a change in ownership in 2001, now focuses almost entirely on Voice-over-IP (VoIP), unified communications, collaboration and contact center products. Mitel is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with offices, partners and resellers worldwide.

In April 2018, the company announced it had been bought by an investor group led by Searchlight Capital Partners.

==History==

===Founding===
Michael Cowpland and Terry Matthews founded Mitel in 1973 (officially on June 8, 1973). Conventionally, its name is regarded as a combination of the founders’ first names and their first product, &quot;Mike and Terry Lawnmowers.&quot; Michael Cowpland stated that the name stands for &quot;Mike and Terry Lawnmowers&quot;, whereas Terry Matthews confirmed the lawnmower acronym during an interview on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; in May 2011.

Cowpland and Matthews formed the corporation with the blessing of their employer, Bell Northern Research, in order to protect their intellectual property rights of the converter design from their employer, who otherwise would have legal ownership rights.

Their first shipment of three lawnmowers was lost in shipping, so they quickly adjusted to produce a telephony tone receiver product (a tone-to-pulse converter for central office use based on Cowpland&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis). Michael Cowpland has also stated that the lawnmowers were not suited to Canadian lawns.

Following the success of the tone receiver, the founders extended their interest in the telecommunications industry. Early on, the pair realized the significance of the then-new microprocessor and software technology to the design of telecom switches. In 1975, they introduced the SX200 PBX. In 1976, the company expanded into the semiconductor field with the acquisition of Siltex, a bankrupt ISO-CMOS foundry in Bromont, Quebec. This evolved into a semiconductor division that specialized in mixed signal and thick film hybrid devices. The company grew at a rate of over 100% per year for several years. They reached the $100 million annual revenue mark by 1981.

===1980 - 2000===
The next major product was a large digital PBX called the SX2000. This was an early attempt to integrate the voice and data functions of office systems. It was conceived as moving beyond the PBX to become an Office Controller, which would handle both voice and data applications within an organization.

In 1985, due to a financial crisis in the company, the board of directors created enough new shares to sell a controlling interest (51%) to British Telecom. British Telecom left the equipment business a few years later and sold its controlling interest in Mitel to an investment company called Schroder Ventures. Schroeder Ventures installed new management, which revitalized the company.

In the meantime, Mitel continued to diversify its product line, introducing the successful SUPERSET line of phone terminals, the GX5000 Central Office, and the SMART-1 call controller, among others. Additionally, Mitel developed and marketed a line of telecom-focussed semiconductor products.

===2000 - 2010===

In 2001, Terry Matthews paid US$230 million to acquire the communications network division of Mitel, along with the &quot;Mitel&quot; trademark. It began a new chapter, under the name Mitel Networks, by developing a family of PBXs based on Internet standards for Voice over IP (VoIP).

The original company retained the semiconductor division. It was renamed Zarlink (&quot;Tsar of Links&quot;) Semiconductor to reflect its interest in networking.

Mitel Knowledge Corporation, also controlled by Matthews, was incorporated in 2001. Numerous patents were transferred to the company. It later evolved into MKC Networks, which made a family of SIP-based IP PBX systems.

An additional split took place in 2002, when the manufacturing arm was spun off out of Mitel Networks to become a contract manufacturer called BreconRidge. With these developments, the original Mitel Corporation was split into three companies: Zarlink (which though renamed is the original corporate entity), Mitel Networks, and BreconRidge.
On May 10, 2006, the new company announced its intention to launch an Initial public offering (IPO). No detailed information was released, but the press indicated that the company hoped to raise $150 million.

In April 2007, Mitel announced an agreement with Inter-Tel to purchase that company. This purchase would amount to a merger of equals, with the merged company being twice the size of the original Mitel. This acquisition was completed in August 2007. Management had announced that the companies will carry on under the name Mitel. As a result of the merger, Mitel withdrew from the IPO registration process.

On April 22, 2010, Mitel became a public company, listed on Nasdaq with the symbol MITL, and its initial offering stood at $14 per share. Within a year, the stock price had dropped to $5.50 and was described by CNBC&#x27;s Jim Cramer as one of the worst IPOs of the year. Cramer blamed excessively optimistic pricing, excessive debt and the fear that company insiders would sell, dropping the stock value.

During the company&#x27;s Q1 conference call, Don Smith (CEO) announced his retirement from the company once the board of directors was able to find a suitable replacement. Smith said he would remain on the board after retirement.

===2011 - 2020===

In 2011, Mitel launched litigation against at least two Australian businesses for infringing on Mitel&#x27;s trademark and the businesses for engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law. The first case against Melbourne telecommunications company MyTel was resolved.

On March 1, 2013, Mitel announced it had completed the sale of its DataNet CommSource business unit (&quot;DataNet&quot;) in Sioux Falls to EarthBend, LLC. In December 2016 the company announced that it had sold its mobility unit for $385 million to Xura and that would focus its business on Unified Communications.

In June 2013, Mitel announced the completion of acquisition of one of its key suppliers, prairieFyre Software Inc., a privately held global provider of contact center, business analytics, and workforce optimization software and services. The net cash cost to Mitel for the acquisition of prairieFyre was approximately $20 million. prairieFyre was an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that supplied Mitel with its existing contact center solution.

In November 2013, Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies.

On March 4, 2014, Mitel announced the acquisition of contact center supplier OAISYS.

In March 2015, Mitel announced to buy Mavenir Systems for $560 million.

In April 2016, Mitel announced its intention to buy Polycom for $1.96 billion. The deal was intended to give existing Polycom shareholders both cash and new Mitel shares for their holdings and result in Polycom shareholders owning 60% of the combined company. The acquisition was ended in favour of a merger with Siris Capital instead, forcing Polycom to pay a US$60 million fee to Mitel for cancelling the deal.

In July 2017, Mitel announced they had reached a deal to buy ShoreTel for $530 million, increasing the size of the company to approximately 4,200 employees.

Major League Baseball, in 2018, entered into a deal with Mitel to unify communications &quot;between the press box, dugout, bullpen and video review rooms at every MLB ballpark from the Rogers Centre to Wrigley Field&quot;.

On November 30, 2018, Mitel announced that all the shares of Mitel were acquired by affiliates of funds advised by Searchlight Capital Partners. The shares ceased trading on the TSX and Nasdaq and were delisted.

In April 2019, Mitel moved to merge with Avaya. The merger did not go through.

In October 2019, Mitel’s CEO Richard McBee resigned. Mary McDowell became the new CEO.

=== 2020 - Present ===

In May 2021, Mitel announced a partnership with Five9.

In November 2021, Mitel and RingCentral entered into an agreement. 

Tarun Loomba became the CEO in the same year.

In January 2023, Mitel announced it entered into exclusive negotiation with Atos to acquire Unify. The acquisition of Unify was completed in October 2023.

<text>Xanthippus () of Lacedaemon, or of Carthage, was a Spartan mercenary general employed by Carthage during the First Punic War. He led the Carthaginian army to considerable success, compared to previous failure, against the Roman Republic during the course of the war, training the army to a professional standard before defeating the Romans at the Battle of Tunis, where Carthaginian forces routed the Roman expeditionary force and captured the Roman consul Marcus Atilius Regulus in 255 BC. 

Diodorus says that Xanthippus was the leader of a small band of Spartan mercenaries drafted by Carthage during the war. Xanthippus was hired as a Spartan drillmaster by the Carthaginians in 255 BC. Polybius tells us that he first came to the attention of the Carthaginian leaders when he criticized the behaviour of Carthage&#x27;s generals, arguing that it was they, and not the Romans, who were causing setbacks. Having been summoned to explain himself to Carthage&#x27;s elite, he successfully argued his case and was placed in command of the Carthaginian army. Despite initial concern amongst the Carthaginians that Xanthippus would not be up to the task, he swiftly proved himself by successfully drilling the Carthaginian army and gained the approval of the soldiery.

Polybius credits Xanthippus with the Carthaginian formation at the Battle of Tunis. He placed the citizen phalanx in the centre of his formation, with the experienced mercenaries holding the right flank. His elephants he placed &quot;a suitable distance&quot; ahead of the phalanx, and his cavalry on his wings supported by more mercenary infantry, where they were able to use their numerical superiority to overwhelm their Roman counterparts and attack the Roman flanks, routing the Roman forces. Having defeated the Roman force in Africa, Polybius says that Xanthippus sailed home for Greece.

Diodorus gives an account of Xanthippus&#x27; death. After the Battle of Tunis, Xanthippus stopped in the city of Lilybaeum (now Marsala, Sicily), which was besieged by the Romans. He inspired courage and led an attack defeating the Romans. Jealous of Xanthippus&#x27;s success, the city betrayed him by giving him a leaky ship, and he supposedly sank in the Adriatic Sea on his voyage home. Scholar John Lazenby argues that this story is completely implausible, a claim supported by a report of a Xanthippus being made governor of a newly acquired province by Ptolemy Euergetes of Egypt in 245 BC. It is supported by Polybius&#x27; assertion that Xanthippus returned to Greece rather than stopping in Lilybaeum, a more likely claim as Polybius lived closer to Xanthippus&#x27; time than Diodorus, and in terms of general plausibility. Appian, in his African Book, asserts that Xanthippus was sent back to Sparta with honors and warships by the Carthaginians, but that they had the ships&#x27; captains toss Xanthippus and his men into the sea. 

Silius Italicus writes that Xanthippus was originally from Amyclae in Laconia. He also says that three sons of Xanthippus, named Xanthippus, Eumachus and Critias, served under Hannibal as mercenary cavalrymen and were killed in the Battle of Ticinus.

<doc id="383193" wikidata="Q229189" url="?curid=383193" title="Joan I of Navarre">
<text>Joan I (14 January 1273 – 31 March/2 April 1305) (, Spanish: &quot;Juana&quot;) was ruling Queen of Navarre and Countess of Champagne from 1274 until 1305. She was also Queen of France by marriage to King Philip IV. She founded the College of Navarre in Paris in 1305.

Joan never ruled Navarre in person, it was overseen by French governors. Having direct control over the County of Champagne, she raised an army to face the invasion of the county by Henry, Count of Bar, even capturing and imprisoning the count. She died in childbirth in 1305.

==Life==
Joan was born in Bar-sur-Seine, Champagne on 14 January 1273 the daughter of King Henry I of Navarre and Blanche of Artois. The following year, upon the death of her father, she became Countess of Champagne and Queen of Navarre. Due to her age, her mother, Blanche, was her guardian and regent in Navarre. 

Various powers, both foreign and Navarrese, sought to take advantage of the minority of the heiress and the &quot;weakness&quot; of the female regent, which caused Joan and her mother to seek protection at the court of Philip III of France. Her mother arrived in France in 1274, and by the Treaty of Orléans in 1275, Joan was betrothed to one of Philip&#x27;s sons (Louis or Philip). Blanche therefore placed her daughter and the government of Navarre under the protection of the King of France. After this, Joan was brought up with Philip. It is, in fact, uncertain whether she ever resided in Navarre during her childhood.

===Queen of France===
At the age of 11, Joan married the future Philip IV of France on 16 August 1284, becoming queen consort of France in 1285 a year later. Their three surviving sons would all rule as kings of France, in turn, and their only surviving daughter, Isabella, became queen consort of England.

Joan was described as a success in her role as Queen of France: she secured the succession, she was an efficient mistress of the royal court, a dignified first lady and had a very good relationship with the King. Having grown up together, the couple evidently had a close relationship and Philip is reported to have loved and respected her deeply. His emotional dependence on her is suggested as a reason why she never visited Navarre. In 1294, Philip appointed her regent of France should his son succeed him being still a minor. However, he is not believed to have entrusted her with influence over the affairs of France unless they involved her own domains Navarre and Champagne. She founded the College of Navarre in Paris in 1305.

===Queen of Navarre and Countess of Champagne===
Joan was declared to be of legal majority upon her marriage in 1284, and did homage for Champagne and Brie to her father-in-law in Paris.

Joan never visited the Kingdom of Navarre, which was ruled in her name by French governors appointed first by her father-in-law and then by her spouse in her name. The French governors were extremely unpopular in Navarre and her absence from the country was resented. It was the French who were blamed for her absence rather than herself, and the loyalty to her was not questioned; rather, it was emphasized in Navarre that it was in fact she rather than the French who was their sovereign. From afar, edicts were issued in her name, coins struck in her image, and she gave her protection to chapels and convents. She never came closer to Navarre than to Carcassonne in 1300, and her spouse was somewhat blamed for this.

Joan was much more directly active as countess of Champagne. While being a county rather than a kingdom, Champagne was much richer and more strategically important. Philip IV appointed her administrators, however, Joan visited Champagne regularly and is recorded to have participated in all duties of a ruling vassal and is not regarded to have been passive but an active independent ruler in this domain. In 1297, she raised and led an army against Count Henry III of Bar when he invaded Champagne. Philip took no part, and Joan brought the count to prison before joining her husband. She also acted in her process against Bishop Guichard of Troyes, whom she accused of having stolen funds from Champagne and her mother by fraud.

==Death==
Joan died in 1305, allegedly in childbirth, but the bishop of Troyes, Guichard, was arrested in 1308 and accused of killing her with witchcraft. He was released in 1313. Joan was buried at the Cordeliers Convent in Paris.

==Children==
With Philip IV of France:
# Margaret (1288 – c. 1294)
# Louis X of France, King Louis I of Navarre from 1305, France from 1314 (October 1289 – 5 June 1316)
# Blanche (1290 – c. 1294)
# Philip V of France and Navarre (as Philip II) (c. 1293 – 3 January 1322)

<text>Adherbal (, ; died 230BC), also known as Atarbas (, &quot;Atárbas&quot;), was the admiral of the Carthaginian fleet which battled the Romans for domination of the Mediterranean Sea during the First Punic War (264–241BC). Polybius identified Adherbal during the Battle of Drepana as the Carthaginian commander-in-chief. He led the Carthaginian fleet to Drepana in Sicily and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Roman consul P. Claudius Pulcher during the naval battle in 249BC.

== Battle of Drepana ==
Encouraged by previous victories, the new consul for 250 Gaius Atilius Regulus launched a campaign to attack the last Punic strongholds on the island of Sicily: Lilybaeum and Drepana. For this surprise attack, which was carried out in 249, the Romans mustered a fleet of 123 quinqueremes. Adherbal was tasked to defend Drepana with the assistance of Hannibal the Rhodian and Carthalo. In their desire for stealth, the Romans attacked at night causing them to lose their formation. Adherbal commanded the Punic fleet and immediately ordered his forces to set to sea when the straggling line of Roman galleys approached the shore by dawn. His defense cost the Romans 93 ships while Carthage lost nothing. 

Adherbal&#x27;s conduct during the siege was documented by historians such as Polybius and Leonardo Bruni. The latter, for instance, described the admiral delivering an &quot;oratio obliqua&quot; before his forces as he led them to meet the Romans. He would later write that Adherbal &quot;won great praise as the man who, by virtue of his courage and skill, restored to his fellow Carthaginians their lost reputation as a sea power.&quot;

<text>The (; meaning &quot;the Guardian(s) of the Peace&quot;) is the national police and security service of Ireland. It is more commonly referred to as the Gardaí (; &quot;Guardians&quot;) or &quot;the Guards&quot;. The service is headed by the Garda Commissioner, who is appointed by the Irish Government. Its headquarters are in Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park.

Since the formation of the in 1923, it has been a predominantly unarmed force, and more than three quarters of the service do not routinely carry firearms. As of February 2023, the police service had 14,470 sworn members (including 371 sworn Reserve members) and 3,348 civilian staff. Operationally, the is organised into four geographical regions: the East, North/West, South and Dublin Metropolitan regions, in turn broken into divisions, districts and sub-districts.

The service is the main law enforcement and security agency in the state, acting at local and national levels. Its roles include crime detection and prevention, drug enforcement, road traffic enforcement and accident investigation, diplomatic and witness protection responsibilities; it also provides a community policing service. Special units exist for specific areas of work such as organised crime prevention, migration management and cyber crime, and there is a central Garda technical bureau, a mounted unit and a canine unit. The service has its own college.

Members of the are not free to join general trade unions but are represented by four rank-based organisations; there is also an association for retired members of the force.

== Terminology ==
The service was originally named the Civic Guard in English, but in 1923 it became the in both English and Irish. This title has been maintained in recent legislation. This is usually translated as &quot;the Guardians of the Peace&quot;. (&quot;of Ireland&quot;, ) appears on its logo but is seldom used elsewhere. At that time, there was a vogue for naming the new institutions of the Irish Free State after counterparts in the French Third Republic; the term &quot;guardians of the peace&quot; (, literally &#x27;peacekeepers&#x27;) had been used since 1870 in French-speaking countries to designate civilian police forces as distinguished from the armed gendarmery, notably municipal police in France, communal guards in Belgium and cantonal police in Switzerland.

The full official title of the police service is rarely used in speech. How it is referred to depends on the register being used. It is variously known as ; &quot;the&quot; ; the ; the (plural); and it is popularly called &quot;the guards&quot;. Although is singular, in these terms it is used as a collective noun, like &quot;police&quot;.

An individual officer is called a (plural ), or less formally, a &quot;guard&quot;, and is typically addressed as such by members of the public when on duty. A police station is called a &quot; station&quot;. is also the name of the lowest rank within the force (e.g. &quot; John Murphy&quot;, analogous to the British term &quot;constable&quot; or the American &quot;officer&quot;, &quot;deputy&quot;, &quot;trooper&quot;, etc.). A female officer was once officially referred to as a (; &quot;female guard&quot;; plural ). This term was abolished in 1990, but is still used colloquially in place of the gender-neutral .

Colloquially, as a slang or derogatory term, they are sometimes referred to in certain areas of Ireland as &quot;the shades&quot;.

== Organisation ==
The general direction and control of the service are the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner, who is appointed by the Government. He or she is responsible to the Minister for Justice and Equality, who in turn is accountable to the government for the security and policing of the state. The Commissioner&#x27;s immediate subordinates are two deputy commissioners – in charge of &quot;Policing and Security&quot; and &quot;Governance &amp; Strategy&quot;, respectively – and a Chief Administrative Officer with responsibility for resource management (personnel, finance, Information and Communications Technology, and accommodation). A few functions, including the Office of Corporate Communications and the Internal Audit Section, report directly to the Commissioner&#x27;s Office. There is an assistant commissioner for each of the four geographical regions, along with a number dealing with other national support functions. The four geographical regions, each overseen by an assistant commissioner, are:
#Dublin Metropolitan Region
#North-Western
#Eastern
#Southern

At an equivalent or near-equivalent level to the assistant commissioners are such figures as the Chief Medical Officer, and the civilian executive directors, heading Information and Communications Technology, Finance and Services, Strategy and Transformation, Legal, and Human Resources and People Development.

Directly subordinate to the assistant commissioners are approximately 40 chief superintendents, about half of whom supervise what are called divisions. Each division contains a number of districts, each commanded by a superintendent assisted by a team of inspectors. Each district contains a number of sub-districts, which are usually commanded by sergeants.

Typically each subdistrict contains only one Garda station. A different number of are based at each station depending on its importance. Most of these stations employ the basic rank of , which was referred to as the rank of Guard until 1972. The most junior members of the service are students, whose duties can vary depending on their training progress. They are often assigned clerical duties as part of their extracurricular studies.

The Garda organisation also has more than 3,000 civilian support staff (not sworn police officers). working across a range of areas such as human resources, occupational health services, finance and procurement, internal audit, IT and telecommunications, accommodation and fleet management, as well as aspects of scene-of-crime support, research and analysis, training and general administration. The figure also includes industrial staff such as traffic wardens, drivers and cleaners.

=== Garda Reserve ===

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provided for the establishment of a Garda Reserve to assist the force in performing its functions and supplement the work of members of the Garda Síochána. The intent of the Garda Reserve is &quot;to be a source of local strength and knowledge&quot;. Reserve members are to carry out duties defined by the Garda Commissioner and sanctioned by the Minister for Justice. With limited training of 128 hours, these duties and powers must be executed under the supervision of regular members of the Service; they are also limited concerning those of regular members.

The first batch of 36 Reserve Gardaí graduated on 15 December 2006 at the Garda College, in Templemore. Having reached a strength of over 1,100 in 2014, as of October 2016, there were 789 Garda Reserve members, with further training scheduled for 2017, however numbers have fallen since then, to under 460 as of 2021, and under 400 by 2023.

==Rank structure==

A &quot;garda&quot; allocated to detective duties, up to and including the rank of chief superintendent, is a detective and the word &quot;detective&quot; () is prefixed to their rank (e.g. detective sergeant, &quot;bleachtaire sáirsint&quot;). The detective moniker is not a rank but rather a role identification, a detective Garda and a Garda are the same rank. As of 31 December 2022, 2,401 Gardaí were on Detective duty, about one-sixth of the total.

== Uniform and equipment ==
=== Uniform ===
In 2022, the fourth iteration of the Garda uniform was launched. It dispensed with formal shirts and ties, substituting a &quot;sky blue&quot; polo shirt, worn with loose-fitting &quot;operational trousers&quot;, and a yellow-and-dark-navy waterproof jacket. A tie is available for formal occasions, and the Garda hat from previous versions of the uniform is retained. Alternative head and other coverings, such as the turban, kippah and hijab, are provided for. The uniform was for force members of the ranks of Garda, sergeant and inspector, with no change for those of superintendent rank or above. The original Garda uniform featured a high &quot;night helmet&quot; and cape, as was then used in the UK. There were changes to colouration of both fabric and buttons in 1987.

=== Equipment ===
Most uniformed members of the do not routinely carry firearms. Individual gardaí have been issued ASP extendable batons and pepper spray as their standard issue weapons while handcuffs are provided as restraints.
The service, when originally created, was armed, but the Provisional Government reversed the decision and reconstituted the service as an unarmed police service. This was in contrast to the attitude of the British Dublin Castle administration, which refused appeals from the Royal Irish Constabulary that the service be disarmed. In the words of first Commissioner, Michael Staines, TD, &quot;the will succeed not by force of arms or numbers, but on their moral authority as servants of the people.&quot; This reflected the approach in the Dublin Metropolitan Police, which had also been unarmed, but did not extend to the CID detective branch, who were armed from the outset.

According to Tom Garvin such a decision gave the new force a cultural ace: &quot;the taboo on killing unarmed men and women who could not reasonably be seen as spies and informers&quot;.

=== Armed Gardaí ===

The Garda Síochána is primarily an unarmed force; however, detectives and certain units such as the regional Armed Support Units (ASU) and the national Emergency Response Unit (ERU) are commissioned to carry firearms and do so. A website managed by the Institute for International and Comparative Law in Africa notes that there are &quot;no specific legal provisions on use of firearms by the Gardaí, which is predominantly an unarmed police service. Instead, the law provides an exemption from licensing requirements under the various Firearms Acts for a member of the Garda Síochána when on duty&quot;.

The armed officers serve as a support to regular Gardaí. Armed units were established in response to a rise in the number of armed incidents dealt with by regular members. To be issued with a firearm, or to carry a firearm whilst on duty, a member must be in possession of a valid gun card, and cannot wear a regular uniform.

Armed Gardaí carry SIG Sauer P226 DAO and Walther P99C DAO semi-automatic pistols. In addition to issued pistols, less-lethal weapons such as tasers and large pepper spray canisters are carried also by the ERU.

In December 2018, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan provided updated specifics.&quot;Training is provided by Firearms Instructors attached to the Garda College and the Emergency Response Unit under the control of the Director of Training, Garda College. ... there are approximately 2700 personnel that are currently authorised to carry firearms. This can increase to approx. 3500 depending on operational requirements. ... Members attached to regular units and Detective units are trained in handguns only, namely Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, Sig Sauer &amp; Walther semi-automatic pistol. Specialist Units such as Emergency Response Unit and the Armed Support Unit are trained in Sig Pistol, H&amp;K MP7 Sub-machine gun, Taser and 40mm direct impact munitions (Less Lethal options)&quot;.

In early April 2019, the Garda Representative Association called for 24-hour armed support units in every division across Ireland. In response, Minister Flanagan noted that &quot;gardaí have had armed support for a long number of years. One of the great attributes of the [Garda Síochána], is the fact that it is in the main an unarmed police service. I think that&#x27;s good and I would be concerned at attempts to ensure that the arming of the gardaí becomes commonplace.&quot; He did not support the GRA demands on a country-wide basis: &quot;I think there is merit in ensuring that at a regional level, there can be an armed response should the circumstances warrant. And I&#x27;m thinking particularly in Drogheda where currently we have an armed support unit on the street in order to meet head-on what is a particularly nasty challenge.&quot;

== Vehicles ==

 patrol cars are white in colour, with a fluorescent yellow and blue battenberg type marking, accompanied by the Garda crest as livery. Full or partial battenburg markings are used on traffic or roads policing vehicles. RSU/ASU vehicles also have Battenburg markings - as well as a red stripe denoting the fact that it is an armed unit. Unmarked patrol cars are also used in the course of regular, traffic and other duties. Specialist units, such as the ERU, use armoured vehicles for special operations.

The Garda Fleet management Section manages the vehicles, totalling approximately 2,750 in 2019, which are located in the various Garda Divisions and specialist units.

== Governance and oversight ==
===Policing Authority===

In the first week of November 2014, Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald obtained the approval of the Irish Cabinet for the General Scheme of the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill 2014, intended to create a new independent policing authority, in what she described as the &#x27;most far-reaching reform’ of the Garda Síochána since the State was founded in 1922. The draft bill proposed that state security would remain the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and outside the remit of the new authority. The first chairperson-designate of the new authority was the outgoing Revenue Commissioners chairperson Josephine Feehily.

=== Inspectorate ===

Under Section 115 of the Act, the Inspectorate consists of three members who are appointed by the Irish Government. The functions of the Inspectorate, , are as follows:
* Carry out, at the request or with the consent of the Minister, inspections or inquiries with any particular aspects of the operation and administration of the ,
* Submit to the Minister (1) a report on those inspections or inquiries, and (2) if required by the Minister, a report on the operation and administration of the Garda Síochána during a specified period and on any significant developments in that regard during that period, and any such reports must contain recommendations for any action the Inspectorate considers necessary.
* Provide advice to the Minister about best policing practices.

The first Chief Inspector (since July 2006), was former Commissioner of Boston Police, Kathleen M. O&#x27;Toole. She reported directly to the Minister for Justice. From 2006 to 2009, O&#x27;Toole was supported by two other inspectors, Robert Olsen and Gwen M. Boniface. Olsen was Chief of Police for 8 years of the Minneapolis Police Department. Boniface is a former Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police and was one of 3 female police commissioners in Canada when appointed in May 1998. She suggested that rank and file Gardaí were not equipped to perform their duties or protect themselves properly. She also suggested that routine arming may become a reality but dismissed the suggestion that this was currently being considered. In 2012, O&#x27;Toole was succeeded by Robert K. Olson.

=== Ombudsman Commission ===

Over 2000 complaints were made against the organisation in 2009, with a similar number of complaints by 2017. The Garda Commissioner referred over 100 incidents where the conduct of a garda resulted in death or serious injury to the Ombudsman for investigation. Also newly instrumented, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (referred to colloquially as the Garda Ombudsman or simply abbreviated to GSOC) replaces the earlier system of complaints (the Complaints Board). Becoming fully operational on 9 May 2007, the commission is empowered to:
* Directly and independently investigate complaints against members of the Garda Síochána
* Investigate any matter, even where no complaint has been made, where it appears that a Garda may have committed an offence or behaved in a way that justified disciplinary proceedings
* Investigate any practice, policy or procedure of the with a view to reducing the incidence of related complaints

The commission&#x27;s first chairman was Kevin Haugh (a High Court Judge) who died in early 2009, shortly before his term of office was to conclude.

== Diplomatic protection ==
The Garda Special Detective Unit (SDU) are primarily responsible for providing armed close protection to senior officials in Ireland. They provide full-time armed protection and transport for the President, Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Minister for Justice, Attorney General, Chief Justice, Director of Public Prosecutions, ambassadors and diplomats deemed &#x27;at risk&#x27;, as well as foreign dignitaries visiting Ireland and citizens deemed to require armed protection as designated so by the Garda Commissioner. The Commissioner is also protected by the unit. All cabinet ministers are afforded armed protection at heightened levels of risk when deemed necessary by Garda Intelligence, and their places of work and residences are monitored. Former Presidents and Taoisigh are protected if their security is under threat, otherwise they only receive protection on formal state occasions. The Emergency Response Unit (ERU), a section of the SDU, are deployed on more than 100 VIP protection duties per year.

== History ==
Prior to the creation of the Irish Free State, policing in Ireland had been undertaken by the quasi-military Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), with a separate and unarmed Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP). These were joined in 1919 by a parallel security force loyal to the provisional government, the Irish Republican Police. The early years of the new state saw a gradual process of incorporating these various pre-existing forces into a single centralised, nationwide and civilian organisation.

The Civic Guard was formed by the Provisional Government in February 1922 to take over the responsibility of policing the fledgeling Irish Free State. It replaced the RIC and the Irish Republican Police of 1919–22. In August 1922 the force accompanied Michael Collins when he met the Lord Lieutenant in Dublin Castle.

The Garda Síochána (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923 enacted after the creation of the Irish Free State on 8 August 1923, provided for the creation of &quot;a force of police to be called and known as &#x27;The . Under section 22, The Civic Guard were deemed to have been established under and to be governed by the Act. The law therefore effectively renamed the existing force.

The seven-week Civic Guard Mutiny began in May 1922, when Garda recruits took over the Kildare Depot. It resulted in Michael Staines&#x27; resignation in September.

During the Civil War of 1922–23, the new Free State set up the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) as an armed, plain-clothed counter-insurgency unit. It was disbanded after the end of the war in October 1923 and elements of it were absorbed into the DMP.

In Dublin, policing remained the responsibility of the DMP (founded 1836) until it merged with the in 1925. Since then, the has been the only civil police service in the state now known as Ireland. Other police forces with limited powers are the Military Police within the Irish Defence Forces, the Airport Police Service, and Dublin Harbour Police and Dún Laoghaire Harbour Police forces.
The headquarters, the Phoenix Park Depot in Dublin, consists of a series of buildings; the first of these were occupied in 1839 by the new Constabulary. Over subsequent years, additional buildings were added, including a riding school, chapel, infirmary and cavalry barracks; all are now used for other purposes. The new Garda Síochána started to occupy the Depot in early 1923. The facility also included a training centre but that was moved to McCan Barracks, Templemore, County Tipperary in the 1960s; it is now the Garda Síochána College.

=== Scott Medal ===
First awarded in 1923, the Scott Medal for Bravery is the highest honour for bravery and valour awarded to a member of the Garda Síochána. The first medals were funded by Colonel Walter Scott, an honorary Commissioner of the New York Police Department. The first recipient of the Scott Medal was Garda James Mulroy. Other notable recipients include Garda Patrick Malone of St. Luke&#x27;s in Cork City who – as an unarmed – disarmed Tomás Óg Mac Curtain (the son of Tomás Mac Curtain).

To mark the United States link, the American English spelling of &quot;valor&quot; is used on the medal. The Commissioner chooses the recipients of the medal, which is presented by the Minister for Justice.

In 2000, Anne McCabe – the widow of Jerry McCabe, a garda who was killed by armed Provisional IRA bank robbers – accepted the Scott Medal for Bravery that had been awarded posthumously to her husband.

The Irish Republican Police had at least one member killed by the RIC on 21 July 1920. The Civic Guard had one killed by accident 22 September 1922 and another was killed in March 1923 by Frank Teeling. Likewise 4 members of the Oriel House CID were killed or died of wounds during the Irish Civil War. The Roll of Honor lists 89 Garda members killed between 1922 and 2020.

=== Commissioners ===


The first Commissioner, Michael Staines, who was a Pro-Treaty member of , held office for only eight months. It was his successors, Eoin O&#x27;Duffy and Éamon Broy, who played a central role in the development of the service. O&#x27;Duffy was Commissioner in the early years of the service when to many people&#x27;s surprise the viability of an unarmed police service was established. O&#x27;Duffy later became a short-lived political leader of the quasi-fascist Blueshirts before heading to Spain to fight alongside Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. Broy had greatly assisted the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Anglo-Irish War, while serving with the DMP. Broy was depicted in the film &quot;Michael Collins&quot; as having been arrested and killed by SIS agents during the Irish War of Independence, when in reality he lived till 1972 and headed the from 1933 to 1938. Broy was followed by Commissioners Michael Kinnane (1938–52) and Daniel Costigan (1952–65). The first Commissioner to rise from the rank of ordinary Garda was William P. Quinn, who was appointed in February 1965.

One later Commissioner, Edmund Garvey, was sacked by the government of Jack Lynch in 1978 after it had lost confidence in him. Garvey won &quot;unfair dismissal&quot; legal proceedings against the government, which was upheld in the Irish Supreme Court. This outcome required the passing of the Act 1979 to retrospectively validate the actions of Garvey&#x27;s successor since he had become Commissioner. Garvey&#x27;s successor, Patrick McLaughlin, was forced to resign along with his deputy in 1983 over his peripheral involvement in a political scandal.

On 25 November 2014 Nóirín O&#x27;Sullivan was appointed as Garda Commissioner, after acting as interim Commissioner since March 2014, following the unexpected retirement of Martin Callinan. It was noted that as a result most top justice posts in Ireland at the time were held by women. The first female to hold the top rank, Commissioner O&#x27;Sullivan joined the force in 1981 and was among the first members of a plainclothes unit set up to tackle drug dealing in Dublin.

On 10 September 2017 Nóirín O&#x27;Sullivan announced her retirement from the force and, by extension, Garda Commissioner. Upon her retirement, Deputy Commissioner Dónall Ó Cualáin was appointed Acting Commissioner pending a permanent replacement. In June 2018, Drew Harris was named as this replacement, and officially appointed in September 2018 following Ó Cualáin&#x27;s retirement.

=== Past reserve forces ===
During the Second World War (often referred to in Ireland as &quot;the Emergency&quot;) there were two reserve forces to the , and the Local Security Force.

 had the power of arrest and wore a uniform, and were allowed to leave the reserve or sign-up as full members of the at the end of the war before the reserve was disbanded. The reserve was established by the Emergency Powers (Temporary Special Police Force) Order 1939.

The Local Security Force (LSF) did not have the power of arrest, and part of the reserve was soon incorporated into the Irish Army Reserve under the command of the Irish Army.

==Inter-jurisdiction co-operation==

===Northern Ireland===
The Patten Report recommended that a programme of long-term personnel exchanges should be established between the and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). This recommendation was enacted in 2002 by an Inter-Governmental Agreement on Policing Cooperation, which set the basis for the exchange of officers between the two services. There are three levels of exchanges:

*Personnel exchanges, for all ranks, without policing powers and for a term up to one year
*Secondments: for ranks Sergeant to Chief Superintendent, with policing powers, for up to three years
*Lateral entry by the permanent transfer of officers for ranks above Inspector and under Assistant Commissioner

The protocols for these movements of personnel were signed by both the Chief Constable of the PSNI and the Garda Commissioner on 21 February 2005.

 officers also co-operate with members of the PSNI to combat cross-border crime and can conduct joint raids on both jurisdictions. They have also accompanied politicians and officials from the Republic, such as the President, on visits to Northern Ireland.

=== Other jurisdictions ===
Since 1989, the has undertaken United Nations peace-keeping duties. Its first such mission was a 50 strong contingent sent to Namibia. Since then the force has acted in Angola, Cambodia, Mozambique, South Africa, and the former Yugoslavia. More recently, &quot;Garda&quot; members have served in Cyprus with UNFICYP, and in Kosovo with EULEX Kosovo. The force&#x27;s first fatality whilst working abroad was Sergeant Paul M. Reid, who was fatally injured while on duty with the United Nations UNPROFOR at &quot;Sniper&#x27;s Alley&quot; in Sarajevo on 18 May 1995.

Members of the also serve in the Embassies of Ireland in London, The Hague, Madrid and Paris. Members are also seconded to Europol in The Hague, in the Netherlands and Interpol in Lyon, France. There are also many members working directly for UN and European agencies such as the War Crimes Tribunal.

Under an agreement with the British Government and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are allowed to inspect the Sellafield nuclear facility in Cumbria, England.

== Controversy and allegations involving the police service ==

The Gardaí have faced complaints or allegations of discourtesy, harassment and perjury. A total of 1,173 complaints were made against the in 2005, with over 2000 complaints made in 2017.

Some such incidents have attracted broad attention and resulted in a number of reform initiatives—such as those relating to Garda whistleblowers or which led to the Morris and Barr Tribunals.

=== Mishandling of cases and complaints ===

The Kerry Babies case was one of the first public inquiries into the mishandling of a investigation. Later, in the 1980s, the Ferns Report (an inquiry into allegations of clerical sexual abuse) described as &quot;wholly inadequate&quot; the handling of one of eight formal complaints made to Wexford gardaí, but noted that the remaining formal complaints were handled in an &quot;effective, professional and sensitive&quot; manner.

The Gardaí were also criticised in the Murphy Report in relation to the handing over of the case of Fr. Paul McGennis to Archbishop McQuaid by Commissioner Costigan. Some very senior Gardaí were criticised for regarding priests as being outside their remit in 1960. On 26 November 2009, then Commissioner Fachtna Murphy apologised for the failure of the Garda Síochána to protect victims of child abuse, saying that inappropriate contact between gardaí and the Dublin Archdiocese had taken place at the time, and later announced an examination into the report&#x27;s findings.

The Gardaí were criticised by the commission of investigation into the Dean Lyons case for their handling of the investigation into the Grangegorman killings. In his report, George Birmingham said that the Gardaí had used leading questions in their interviews with Lyons, and had failed to act on a suspicion that Lyons&#x27; confession was unreliable. For a period, the gardaí involved in the case failed to act on the knowledge that another man, Mark Nash, had confessed to the crime.

=== Allegations resulting in Tribunals of Inquiry ===

In the 1990s and early 2000s the faced allegations of corrupt and dishonest policing in County Donegal. This became the subject of a Garda inquiry (the Carty inquiry) and subsequent judicial inquiry (the Morris Tribunal). The Morris Tribunal found that some gardaí based in County Donegal had invented a Provisional IRA informer, made bombs and claimed credit for locating them, and attempted to frame Raphoe publican Frank McBrearty Junior for murderthe latter case involving a €1.5m settlement with the State. A similar case saw a €4.5m judgement, after another Donegal publican was wrongly convicted based on &quot;perjured Garda evidence&quot; and &quot;a conspiracy to concoct false evidence&quot; by the same Donegal-based gardaí.

On 20 April 2000, members of the ERU shot dead 27-year-old John Carthy at the end of a 25-hour siege as he left his home in Abbeylara, County Longford with a loaded shotgun in his hands. There were allegations made of inappropriate handling of the situation and of the reliance on lethal force by the . This led to a inquiry, and subsequently, the Barr Tribunal. The official findings of the tribunal of inquiry, under Justice Robert Barr, were that the responsible sergeant had made 14 mistakes in his role as the negotiator during the siege, and failed to make real efforts to achieve resolution during the armed stand-off. It further stated however that the sergeant was limited by lack of experience and resources, and recommended a review of command structures, and that the ERU be equipped with stun guns and other non-lethal options. The Barr tribunal further recommended a formal working arrangement between Gardaí and state psychologists, and improvements in Garda training.

During the mid-2010s, the Garda whistleblower scandal led to a tribunal of enquiry, and the resignations of two ministers for justice and two Garda commissioners.

=== Allegations involving abuse of powers ===
One of the first charges of serious impropriety against the force rose out of the handling of the Sallins Train Robbery in 1976. This case eventually led to accusations that a &quot;Heavy Gang&quot; within the force intimidated and tortured the accused. This eventually led to a Presidential pardon for one of the accused.

In 2004, an RTÉ &quot;Prime Time&quot; documentary accused elements within the of abusing their powers by physically assaulting people arrested. A retired Circuit Court judge (W. A. Murphy) suggested that some members of the force had committed perjury in criminal trials before him but later stated that he was misquoted, while Minister of State Dick Roche, accused Gardaí in one instance of &quot;torture&quot;. The Commissioner accused the television programme of lacking balance. The documentary followed the publication of footage by the Independent Media Centre showing scuffles between and Reclaim the Streets demonstrators. One in the footage was later convicted of common assault, while several other were acquitted.

In 2014, a debate arose relating to alleged abuse of process in cancelling penalty points (for traffic offences), and a subsequent controversy resulted in a number of resignations.

In 2017, Dara Quigley, who lived with mental illness, was arrested for public nudity, an incident captured on CCTV. A Garda member went to the police station CCTV control room and recorded the incident on a phone, then shared it to a WhatsApp group including other Gardaí. The video was quickly shared to Facebook and went viral. Quigley took her own life several days later. The Garda, who recorded and shared the video, was not charged with a crime.

=== Allegations involving cross-border policing and collusion with the IRA ===
The former head of intelligence of the Provisional IRA, Kieran Conway claimed that in 1974 the IRA were tipped off by &quot;high-placed figures&quot; within the Gardaí about a planned RUC Special Branch raid, which was intended to capture members of the IRA command. Asked if this was just a one-off example of individual Gardaí colluding with the IRA, Conway claimed: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just in 1974 and it wasn&#x27;t just concentrated in border areas like Dundalk, it was some individuals but it was more widespread.&quot;

Following a recommendation from the Cory Collusion Inquiry, the Smithwick Tribunal investigated allegations of collusion following the 1989 killing of two Royal Ulster Constabulary officers by the Provisional IRA as they returned from a meeting with the . The tribunal&#x27;s report was published in December 2013, and noted that, although there was no &quot;smoking gun&quot;, Judge Smithwick was &quot;satisfied there was collusion in the murders&quot; and that &quot;evidence points to the fact that there was someone within the Garda station assisting the IRA&quot;. The report was also critical of two earlier Garda investigations into the murders, which it described as &quot;inadequate&quot;. Irish Justice Minister Alan Shatter apologised &quot;without reservation&quot; for the failings identified in the report.

The family of Eddie Fullerton, a Buncrana councillor killed in 1991 by members of the Ulster Defence Association, criticised the subsequent investigation, and in 2006, the Minister for Justice considered a public inquiry into the case.

=== Operational management and finances ===
Protests at the proposed Royal Dutch Shell Corrib gas refinery near Erris, County Mayo saw large Garda operations with up to 200 Gardaí involved. By September 2008, the cost of the operation was €10 million, and by January 2009 estimated to have cost €13.5 million. Some outlets compared this to the €20 million budgeted for operations targeting organised crime. A section of road used by the protesters was allegedly dubbed &quot;the Golden Mile&quot; by Gardaí because of overtime opportunities. Complaints were also made about Garda management and handling of the protests.

In 2017, a number of reported operational issues (including handling of the Garda whistleblower scandal, falsified alcohol breath tests, and the finances of the Garda Training College) were referenced as contributors to the early retirement of then commissioner Nóirín O&#x27;Sullivan.

== Reform initiatives ==

Arising from some of the above incidents, the underwent a number of reform initiatives in the early 21st century. The Morris Tribunal, in particular, recommended major changes to the organisation&#x27;s management, discipline, promotion and accountability arrangements. Many of these recommendations were subsequently implemented under the Garda Síochána Act 2005.

It was also stated by the tribunal chairman, Justice Morris, that the code of discipline was extremely complex and, at times, &quot;cynically manipulated&quot; to promote indiscipline across the force. Judicial reviews, for example, were cited as a means for delaying disciplinary action.

The fall-out from the Morris Tribunal was considerable. While fifteen members of the force were sacked between 2001 and 2006, and a further 42 resigned in lieu of dismissal in the same period, Commissioner Conroy stated that he was constrained in the responses available to deal with members whose misbehaviour is cited in public inquiries.

=== Updated procedures and code of discipline ===

With support from opposition parties, and reflecting broad political consensus, the Minister for Justice responded to many of these issues by announcing a new draft code of discipline on 17 August 2006. The new streamlined code introduced new procedures to enable the Commissioner to summarily dismiss a alleged to have brought the force into disrepute, abandoned duties, compromised the security of the State or unjustifiably infringed the rights of other persons.

In addition, a four-member &quot;non-officer management advisory team&quot; was appointed in August 2006 to advise on implementing change options and addressing management and leadership challenges facing the .

=== Enhanced oversight ===
The Garda Inspectorate, Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and Policing Authority were introduced, as part of the reform process, under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and the Garda Síochána (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015.

=== Public attitudes to the Garda Síochána ===
The Garda Public Attitudes Survey 2017 found that 74% of respondents were satisfied with the , down from 81% in the 2008 survey.

The 2017 survey (taken before revelations of false breath tests, wrongful convictions and the departure of the then commissioner) also found that less than half of respondents believed that the was a well managed or world-class police service.

=== Labour disputes ===
Industrial action (including work-to-rule and withdrawal of labour) was threatened by Gardaí during 2016, arising out of a dispute on pay and conditions.

===Linguistic capabilities and diversity===
In 2015, it was reported that the Garda had no active officers who are proficient in Arabic, forcing them to rely on assistance from Interpol. There were calls to recruit Arabic-speaking recruits, especially those from the Irish Muslim community.

In 2019, the European Network Against Racism Ireland submitted a paper calling for the Garda&#x27;s Garda Racial, Intercultural, and Diversity Office to be disbanded and replaced with a specialist unit due to its limited manpower and resources to tackle hate crime cases.

== Band ==

The Garda Band is a public relations branch of the , and was formed shortly after the foundation of the force. It gave its first public performance on Dún Laoghaire Pier on Easter Monday 1923, and its first Bandmaster was Superintendent D.J. Delaney. In 1938, the Dublin Metropolitan Band (based at Kevin Street) and the Band amalgamated and were based at Headquarters in Phoenix Park.

Besides providing music for official functions (such as graduation ceremonies at the Garda College) the band also performs at schools, festivals and sporting events.

Members of the band, none of whom are involved in policing duties, were paid an average of €58,985 in 2017.

== Representation ==
There are four legally-recognised bodies defined by regulation, each working with specific ranks of Garda:
* the Garda Representative Association (GRA), for all officers of the rank of Garda
* the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI), for the ranks of Sergeant, Station Sergeant and Inspector
* the Association of Garda Superintendents (AGS)
* the Association of Garda Chief Superintendents (AGCS)

There is also the Garda Retired Members Association (GRMA), previously the Garda Pensioners Association.

== Other associated bodies ==
Members of the Garda Síochána have their own credit unions and a medical insurance society, as well as a benevolent society for members and former members in need. The organisation has a wide range of clubs and societies, with a coordinating structure, the Coiste Siamsa, for sporting groups.

<doc id="383208" wikidata="Q7804964" url="?curid=383208" title="Time Cube">
<text>Time Cube was a pseudoscientific personal web page set up in 1997 by Otis Eugene &quot;Gene&quot; Ray. It was a self-published outlet for Ray&#x27;s &quot;theory of everything&quot;, also called &quot;Time Cube&quot;, which claims that all modern sciences are participating in a worldwide conspiracy to omit his theory, which posits that each day actually consists of four days occurring simultaneously. Ray described himself as the &quot;wisest man on earth&quot; and a &quot;godlike being with superior intelligence who has absolute evidence and proof&quot; for his views. Ray asserted repeatedly and variously that the academic world had not taken Time Cube seriously.

According to Find a Grave, Ray died on 18 March 2015, and the Time Cube website registration expired in August 2015.

== Website ==
The Time Cube website did not have a home page. A large amount of self-invented jargon is used throughout, often never defined. In one paragraph, Ray claimed that his own wisdom &quot;so antiquates known knowledge&quot; that a psychiatrist examining his behavior diagnosed him with schizophrenia.

Adi Robertson of &quot;The Verge&quot; commented that Ray&#x27;s theory of time is &quot;an incredibly confusing one peppered with racism and homophobia&quot;.

== Time Cube concept ==

Ray&#x27;s personal model of reality, called &quot;Time Cube&quot;, states that all of modern physics and education is wrong, and argues that, among many other things, Greenwich Time is a global conspiracy. He uses various graphs (along with pictures of himself) that purport to show how each day is really four separate days—&quot;SUN-UP&quot;, &quot;MID-DAY&quot;, &quot;SUN-DOWN&quot;, and &quot;MID-NIGHT&quot; (formerly morning, early afternoon, late afternoon, and evening)—occurring simultaneously.

The following quotation from the website illustrates the recurring theme:
Ray offered $1,000 or $10,000 to anyone who could prove his views wrong.
==Reception==
Ray spoke about Time Cube at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in January 2002 as part of a student-organized extra-curricular event during the independent activities period. He repeated his $10,000 offer for professors to disprove his notions at the event; none attempted it. John C. Dvorak wrote in &quot;PC Magazine&quot; that &quot;Metasites that track crackpot sites often say this is the number one nutty site.&quot; He also characterized the site&#x27;s content as &quot;endless blather.&quot; When asked by Martin Sargent in 2003 how it felt to be an Internet celebrity, Ray stated that it was not a position he wanted, but something he felt he had to do as &quot;no writer or speaker understands the Time Cube.&quot; Ray also spoke about Time Cube at the Georgia Institute of Technology in April 2005, delivering a speech in which he attacked the instruction offered by academics.

In 2005, Brett Hanover made &quot;Above God&quot;, a short documentary film about Ray and Time Cube. The film was likely named after one of Ray&#x27;s websites, which criticized the idea that God exists. Hanover&#x27;s film won awards for Best Documentary at the Indie Memphis Film Festival and the Atlanta Underground Film Festival.

== In popular culture ==
The song &quot;To the End of the World&quot; on Alestorm&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;No Grave But the Sea&quot; makes several references to the Time Cube concept.

<doc id="383211" wikidata="Q506360" url="?curid=383211" title="Bert Kaempfert">
<text>Bert Kaempfert (born Berthold Heinrich Kämpfert; 16 October 1923 – 21 June 1980) was a German orchestra leader, multi-instrumentalist, music producer, arranger, and composer. He made easy listening and jazz-oriented records and wrote the music for a number of well-known songs, including &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; and &quot;Moon Over Naples&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Kaempfert was born in Hamburg, Germany, where he received his lifelong nickname, Fips, and studied at the Hamburg School of Music. A multi-instrumentalist who played accordion, piano, clarinet, and other instruments, he was hired by Hans Busch to play with his orchestra, before serving as a bandsman in the German Navy during World War II. He later formed his own big band and toured with them, following that by working as an arranger and producer, making hit records with Freddy Quinn and Ivo Robić. Kaempfert met his future wife, Hannelore, in 1945. They married a year later, on 14 August 1946. They had two daughters, Marion and Doris.

===Bert Kaempfert &amp; His Orchestra===
Kaempfert&#x27;s first hit with his orchestra was &quot;Wonderland by Night&quot;. Recorded in July 1959, the song could not get released in Germany, so Kaempfert took the track to Decca Records in New York, which released it in the United States in the fall of 1960. With its haunting solo trumpet by Charles Tabor, muted brass, and lush strings, the single topped the American pop charts and turned Bert Kaempfert and Orchestra into international stars. Over the next few years, he revived such pop tunes as &quot;Tenderly&quot;, &quot;Red Roses for a Blue Lady&quot;, &quot;Three O&#x27;Clock in the Morning&quot;, and &quot;Bye Bye Blues&quot;, as well as composing pieces of his own, including &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Moon Over Naples&quot;), &quot;Danke Schoen&quot;, and &quot;Wooden Heart&quot;, which were recorded by, respectively, Al Martino, Wayne Newton, and Elvis Presley. For Kaempfert, little brought him more personal satisfaction than Nat King Cole recording his &quot;L-O-V-E&quot;.

Kaempfert&#x27;s orchestra made extensive use of horns. A couple of numbers that featured brass prominently, &quot;Magic Trumpet&quot; and &quot;The Mexican Shuffle&quot;, were played by both Kaempfert&#x27;s orchestra and by Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass. The Brass covered &quot;Magic Trumpet&quot;, and Kaempfert returned the favor by covering Brass compadre Sol Lake&#x27;s number &quot;The Mexican Shuffle&quot;. The latter tune evolved into a TV ad, &quot;The Teaberry Shuffle&quot;.

===Promotion of the Beatles===
In his capacity as record producer, Kaempfert played a part in the rise of the Beatles. In 1961, he hired the Beatles to back Tony Sheridan on an album called &quot;My Bonnie&quot;. Sheridan had been performing in Hamburg, and needed to recruit a band to play behind him on the proposed tracks. Kaempfert auditioned and signed the Beatles, and recorded two tracks with them during his sessions for Sheridan: &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot; (sung by rhythm guitarist John Lennon) and &quot;Cry for a Shadow&quot; (an instrumental written by Lennon and lead guitarist George Harrison). The album and its singles, released by Polydor Records, were the Beatles&#x27; first commercially released recordings.

On 28 October 1961, a customer in the Liverpool music store owned by Brian Epstein asked for a copy of &quot;My Bonnie&quot;. The store did not have it, but Epstein noted the request. He was so intrigued by the idea of a Liverpool band releasing a record that he investigated. That led to his discovery of the Beatles and, through his efforts, their signing by George Martin to Parlophone Records after Kaempfert helped them avoid any contractual claim from Polydor.

==Songwriting==
Throughout the 1960s, various artists recorded renditions of Kaempfert&#x27;s music:
*&quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; (with words by Charles Singleton and Eddie Snyder) was originally recorded as part of his score for the 1966 film &quot;A Man Could Get Killed&quot;. It became a #1 hit for Frank Sinatra in 1966, despite Sinatra&#x27;s hatred of the song. This was followed a year later with another hit for Sinatra, &quot;The World We Knew (Over and Over)&quot;.
*&quot;Wooden Heart&quot;, sung by Elvis Presley in the film &quot;G.I. Blues&quot;, was a hit in 1961. Joe Dowell&#x27;s cover of &quot;Wooden Heart&quot; became a big hit, reaching #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on August 28, 1961. Kaempfert arranged the traditional German folk song &quot;Muss i denn&quot; for the Presley movie.
*His instrumental &quot;Moon Over Naples&quot;, when given words by Snyder, became &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;, originally a hit for Al Martino and also recorded by Engelbert Humperdinck, Presley, and many others.
*&quot;Danke Schoen&quot;, with words added by Kurt Schwabach and Milt Gabler, became Wayne Newton&#x27;s signature song.
*&quot;L-O-V-E&quot;, with words added by Milt Gabler, was a hit for Nat King Cole.
*&quot;Almost There&quot;, which reached No. 67 on the U.S. charts but No. 2 on the U.K. charts, was recorded by Andy Williams.
*His 1962 movie theme from the film &quot;90 Minuten nach Mitternacht&quot; (&quot;Terror After Midnight&quot;), with lyrics added by Herb Rehbein and Joe Seneca, became a pop ballad called &quot;Love After Midnight&quot;, recorded by both Patti Page (1964) and Jack Jones (1966).
*A jazzier number called &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Safari&quot; was the theme tune for the long-running TV game show &quot;The Match Game&quot;, used on the NBC version from 1962 to 1967. The composer received credit for the theme (&quot;Music by Bert Kaempfert&quot;) but the recording was an American cover version by the Billy Vaughn orchestra.
* Another 1962 single, &quot;That Happy Feeling&quot;, became well known as background music for children&#x27;s television programming, most notably that of Sandy Becker on his daily WNEW-TV (now WNYW) show in New York between 1963 and 1967.
*The LP &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Safari&quot; was heavily influenced by South African kwela style music, containing versions of &quot;Zambesi&quot;, &quot;Wimoweh&quot;, &quot;Skokiaan&quot;, and &quot;Afrikaan Beat&quot;, as well as the title track. Many of the tracks were later used in the film &quot;An Elephant Called Slowly&quot; (1969).
*&quot;Tahitian Sunset&quot; was sampled extensively by the lo-fi dance artists Lemon Jelly as their track &quot;In the Bath&quot;.

In 1963, jazz trumpeter Bobby Hackett recorded a complete album with 12 Kaempfert compositions, &quot;Bobby Hackett Plays the Music of Bert Kaempfert&quot;. It was re-released in the United States under the Sony Records label in the Collectable Jazz Classics series, along with the album &quot;Bobby Hackett Plays The Music of Henry Mancini&quot; on a &quot;2-in-1&quot; CD.

In 1967, jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain recorded the album &quot;Pete Fountain Plays Bert Kaempfert&quot; in Hamburg, Germany, with musicians from Kaempfert&#x27;s orchestra. It featured Kaempfert&#x27;s signature hits.

In 1967, the Anita Kerr Singers released the LP &quot;Bert Kaempfert Turns Us On!&quot;, a tribute to Kaempfert, featuring the standard hits.

In 1967, Jimi Hendrix included the melody of &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; in his improvised guitar solo for his guitar-burning version of &quot;Wild Thing&quot; at the Monterey Pop Festival.

In 1968, jazz trumpeter Al Hirt recorded the album &quot;Al Hirt Plays Bert Kaempfert&quot;. It too featured Kaempfert&#x27;s major hits. That year, BMI awarded accolades to five of Kaempfert&#x27;s songs: &quot;Lady&quot;, &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;, &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, &quot;The World We Knew&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Maria&quot;. Many of his hits during the 1960s were composed and arranged with the help of German Herb Rehbein, who became a successful bandleader in his own right. Rehbein&#x27;s death in 1979 shook Kaempfert deeply. Both Kaempfert and Rehbein were posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

In 1970, Johnny Mathis issued a double LP, &quot;Sings the Music of Bacharach &amp; Kaempfert&quot;, for Columbia. It consisted of 21 tracks in a heavyweight gatefold picture sleeve. The Kaempfert tracks were done in his arrangement style, and the Bacharach tracks were done in the American&#x27;s unique upbeat style. The same year, Kaempfert composed the score for the war film &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win &#x27;Em All&quot;, starring Tony Curtis and Charles Bronson.

By the 1970s, sales of Kaempfert&#x27;s music had declined, but he continued to record. His version of the &quot;Theme from &quot;Shaft&quot;&quot; was admired by composer Isaac Hayes and remained popular with audiences. He expanded the musical scope of his band and recorded in a wide variety of styles. He also began to play live concerts with his orchestra, beginning in 1974, with an appearance at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

Kaempfert is sampled in the 1998 song &quot;One Week&quot; by the Barenaked Ladies. The song&#x27;s lyrics also declare that &quot;Bert Kaempfert&#x27;s got the mad hits&quot;.

== Collaborations ==
Kaempfert used many musicians who were available in West Germany and other parts of Europe, including many of the same players who played for James Last, Kai Warner, and Roberto Delgado. He featured such top soloists as trumpeters Charly Tabor, Werner Gutterer, Manfred Moch, and Ack van Rooyen, trombonists Åke Persson and Jiggs Whigham, and sax/flute player Herb Geller. Drummer Rolf Ahrens supplied the characteristically simple but steady beat, often playing just a snare drum with brushes.

Another contributor to Kaempfert&#x27;s music was guitarist/bassist Ladislav &quot;Ladi&quot; Geisler, who popularized the &quot;knackbass&quot; (crackling bass) sound, initially playing a Gibson EB and later a Fender Jazz Bass Guitar, which became the most distinctive feature of many Kaempfert recordings — a treble staccato bass guitar sound in which the bass string was plucked with a pick and immediately suppressed to cancel out any sustain. An acoustic bass played a simple pattern in unison with this staccato electric bass, which created a unique sound. It was Geisler who lent his guitar amplifier to The Beatles for their recording session with Tony Sheridan, after the band&#x27;s own equipment proved to be inadequate for recording purposes.

== Death and legacy ==
Kaempfert died suddenly following a stroke at his home in Mallorca on 21 June 1980, at the age of 56, shortly after a successful appearance in the United Kingdom.

Bert-Kaempfert-Platz, a square in the Barmbek district of Hamburg, Germany, is named after him.

<doc id="383217" wikidata="Q3482662" url="?curid=383217" title="Daggerboard">
<text>A daggerboard is a retractable centreboard used by various sailing craft. While other types of centreboard may pivot to retract, a daggerboard slides in a casing. The shape of the daggerboard converts the forward motion into a windward lift, countering the leeward push of the sail. The theoretical centre of lateral resistance is on the trailing edge of the daggerboard.

==General==
A daggerboard is a removable vertical keel that is inserted through a &quot;trunk&quot; in the center of a vessel&#x27;s hull, usually amidships. Daggerboards are usually found in small sailing craft such as day sailers, which are easily handled by a single person. Daggerboards are not usually ballasted but are locked in place by a clip or pin. Unlike a centreboard, which can be set at different angles to the hull of the boat, daggerboards are generally limited to a single perpendicular position relative to the hull. If a daggerboard is located off center, it is called a leeboard or a bilgeboard. 

The characteristic which differentiates daggerboards from other centerboards and swing keels is that daggerboards are easily removable, even when the boat is underway. Centerboards and swing keels, common alternatives to fixed keels, can pivot up and down but are fixed to the hull. The freedom of movement of dagger- and centerboards allows them to swing or slide up into the hull of the boat, which is advantageous when sailing in shallow waters. The pivoting centerboard or swing keel can swing up when it strikes an object which helps prevents the sort of damage to which fixed keels or daggerboards are subject. Daggerboards can be raised and lowered as needed but will generally be damaged if not retracted before impact with the bottom or with floating objects. 

Many small sailboats use a daggerboard instead of a fixed keel. This allows these boats to be more easily moved on trailers, sailed in shallow waters, and easily beached. Daggerboards also afford an opportunity to reduce drag when racing because they can be retracted when not needed (i.e. when sailing downwind or in very light winds). 

Daggerboards are often made of wood; the problem with wood is that wood rots over time. Alternate materials for daggerboards are metal (aluminum/steel) and fiberglass. A daggerboard boat can be costly to manufacture. If not well-made, the daggerboard will transfer vibrations from the trunk through the hull. 

===Purpose===
The purpose of the daggerboard (or any keel) is to balance the force of the wind on the sails. Without a daggerboard or keel, a sailboat could not sail up-wind and would simply be blown sideways. 

During a storm, daggerboards can help reduce the tendency of a small boat to tip over (&quot;breach&quot;) due to waves. A catamaran in a storm would lift the leeward hull daggerboard and fully extend the upwind daggerboard. If there is no wind and an outboard motor is being used, lifting the daggerboards will ensure the least drag.

When a small sailboat flips on its side, the keel can also be used to right the boat. Standing on the keel gives the sailor additional leverage to roll the hull upright. The centerboard, daggerboard, or bilgeboard can be used as a platform upon which to stand, providing increased leverage, in the event the dinghy overturns via a capsize or turtle.

===How it works===
Because water is denser than air, the force generated by wind against the much larger surface area of the sails can be equalized by the force of a relatively small daggerboard pushing in the water below the hull. A daggerboard fits into a trunk that runs through the hull of the rig. When the board is in the trunk it keeps the water out while in use due to how tightly wedged it is. It is held in place by a pin on the forward end or a shock cord. The daggerboard puts a counterforce from the wind pushing on the sails. Daggerboards are often long and thin to reduce drag and increase effective lift, thus providing a better lift-to-drag ratio. 

===History===
In 2008, a daggerboard ship was found using deep scan sonar equipment off the southern shore of Lake Ontario, the only such vessel known to have been found in the Great Lakes. Vessels of this type were used for a short time in the early 19th century.

In the early 19th century daggerboards were infrequently being used on American schooners. These schooners were used for nearby coastal trade of cotton, wheat, and apples. A sunken 1833 daggerboard schooner was found in the great lakes with the help of sonar equipment. Knowing this, daggerboards have been around since late in the 17th century. Daggerboards can be found on monohulls which is the classic sailboat and multihulls called catamarans. 

Daggerboards come in all different shapes and sizes, some curved or s-shaped. Curved daggerboards started to appear thirty to forty years ago. The first prototype was made in 1985 by Ian Farrier. The benefits of vertical lift generated by curved daggerboards are nominal. When actually sailing, curved daggerboards - not to be confused with hydrofoils - do not make a drastic change.

==Boats with daggerboards==
Generally, daggerboards are used on smaller rigs such as 10 to 40 feet for racing but there is a large number of custom and semi-custom catamaran builders who offer daggerboards as an option. Daggerboard rigs may be faster than fixed keels because fixed keels have so much hydrodynamic drag by the shape. Some makes which utilize a daggerboard design are: The Mirror Dinghy, Laser, Vanguard 15.

<doc id="383220" wikidata="Q407931" url="?curid=383220" title="Magnesium carbonate">
<text>Magnesium carbonate, (archaic name magnesia alba), is an inorganic salt that is a colourless or white solid. Several hydrated and basic forms of magnesium carbonate also exist as minerals.

==Forms==
The most common magnesium carbonate forms are the anhydrous salt called magnesite (), and the di, tri, and pentahydrates known as barringtonite (), nesquehonite (), and lansfordite (), respectively. Some basic forms such as artinite (), hydromagnesite (), and dypingite () also occur as minerals. All of those minerals are colourless or white.

Magnesite consists of colourless or white trigonal crystals. The anhydrous salt is practically insoluble in water, acetone, and ammonia. All forms of magnesium carbonate react with acids. Magnesite crystallizes in the calcite structure wherein  is surrounded by six oxygen atoms.

The dihydrate has a triclinic structure, while the trihydrate has a monoclinic structure.

References to &quot;light&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; magnesium carbonates actually refer to the magnesium hydroxy carbonates hydromagnesite and dypingite, respectively. The &quot;light&quot; form is precipitated from magnesium solutions using alkali carbonate at &quot;normal temperatures&quot; while the &quot;heavy&quot; may be produced from boiling concentrated solutions followed by precipitation to dryness, washing of the precipitate, and drying at 100 C. 

==Preparation==

Magnesium carbonate is ordinarily obtained by mining the mineral magnesite. Seventy percent of the world&#x27;s supply is mined and prepared in China.

Magnesium carbonate can be prepared in laboratory by reaction between any soluble magnesium salt and sodium bicarbonate:

If magnesium chloride (or sulfate) is treated with aqueous sodium carbonate, a precipitate of basic magnesium carbonate – a hydrated complex of magnesium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide – rather than magnesium carbonate itself is formed:

High purity industrial routes include a path through magnesium bicarbonate, which can be formed by combining a slurry of magnesium hydroxide and carbon dioxide at high pressure and moderate temperature. The bicarbonate is then vacuum dried, causing it to lose carbon dioxide and a molecule of water:
:

==Chemical properties==

===With acids===
Like many common group 2 metal carbonates, magnesium carbonate reacts with aqueous acids to release carbon dioxide and water:
:

===Decomposition===
At high temperatures MgCO3 decomposes to magnesium oxide and carbon dioxide. This process is important in the production of magnesium oxide. This process is called calcining:
: (ΔH = +118 kJ/mol)

The decomposition temperature is given as 350 °C (662 °F).
However, calcination to the oxide is generally not considered complete below 900 °C due to interfering readsorption of liberated carbon dioxide.

The hydrates of the salts lose water at different temperatures during decomposition. For example, in the trihydrate , which molecular formula may be written as , the dehydration steps occur at 157 °C and 179 °C as follows:

: at 157 °C
: at 179 °C

==Uses==
The primary use of magnesium carbonate is the production of magnesium oxide by calcining. Magnesite and dolomite minerals are used to produce refractory bricks. is also used in flooring, fireproofing, fire extinguishing compositions, cosmetics, dusting powder, and toothpaste. Other applications are as filler material, smoke suppressant in plastics, a reinforcing agent in neoprene rubber, a drying agent, and colour retention in foods.

Because of its low solubility in water and hygroscopic properties, was first added to table salt () in 1911 to make it flow more freely. The Morton Salt company adopted the slogan &quot;When it rains it pours&quot;, highlighting that its salt, which contained , would not stick together in humid weather. 
Powdered magnesium carbonate, known as &quot;climbing chalk&quot; or &quot;gym chalk&quot; is also used as a drying agent on athletes&#x27; hands in rock climbing, gymnastics, powerlifting, weightlifting and other sports in which a firm grip is necessary. A variant is liquid chalk.

As a food additive, magnesium carbonate is known as E504. Its only known side effect is that it may work as a laxative in high concentrations.

Magnesium carbonate is used in taxidermy for whitening skulls. It can be mixed with hydrogen peroxide to create a paste, which is spread on the skull to give it a white finish.

Magnesium carbonate is used as a matte white coating for projection screens.

===Medical use===
It is a laxative to loosen the bowels.

In addition, high purity magnesium carbonate is used as an antacid and as an additive in table salt to keep it free flowing. Magnesium carbonate can do this because it does not dissolve in water, only in acid, where it will effervesce (bubble).

==Safety==
Magnesium carbonate is non-toxic and non-flammable.

<text>The vigintisexviri ( &quot;vigintisexvir&quot;; ) were a college (&quot;collegium&quot;) of minor magistrates (&quot;magistratus minores&quot;) in the Roman Republic. The college consisted of six boards:

* the &quot;decemviri stlitibus judicandis&quot; – 10 magistrates who judged lawsuits, including those dealing with whether a man was free or a slave;
* the &quot;tresviri capitales&quot;, also known as &quot;nocturni&quot; – three magistrates who had a police function in Rome, in charge of prisons and the execution of criminals;
* the &quot;tresviri monetales&quot; or &quot;tresviri aere argento auro flando feriundo&quot; – three magistrates who were in charge of striking and casting bronze, silver and gold (minting coins);
* the &quot;quattuorviri viis in urbe purgandis&quot; – four magistrates overseeing road maintenance within the city of Rome;
* the &quot;duoviri viis extra urbem purgandis&quot; – two magistrates overseeing road maintenance near Rome; and
* the four &quot;praefecti Capuam Cumas&quot; – praefecti sent to Capua and Cumae in Campania to administer justice there.

Being a member of the &quot;vigintisexviri&quot; was a prerequisite to the quaestorship after the reforms of Sulla. The label used for these magistrates may only have been introduced after Sullan times, but the first of the constituent boards may date back to the third century BC.

The &quot;duoviri viis extra urbem purgandis&quot; and the four &quot;praefecti Capuam Cumas&quot; were abolished by Augustus , reducing the &quot;vigintisexviri&quot; to the &quot;vigintiviri&quot;. In AD 13, the senate restricted eligibility, ordaining that only equites should be eligible to the college of the then-&quot;vigintiviri&quot;. The remaining boards were not abolished entirely until at least the third century.

<text>The Mirror is a type of popular sailing dinghy with more than 70,000 built.

The Mirror was named after the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, a UK newspaper with a largely working-class distribution. The Mirror was from the start promoted as an affordable boat, and as a design it has done a great deal to make dinghy sailing accessible to a wide audience. Although most popular in the UK, Mirrors are also sailed in other countries, notably Australia, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, the Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand, the Philippines and the United States.

==Design==
The Mirror was designed by Jack Holt and TV do-it-yourself expert Barry Bucknell in 1962. It employed a novel construction method where sheets of marine plywood are held together with copper stitching and fibreglass tape. This is called tack and tape or stitch and glue construction. Buoyancy is provided by four independent integral chambers rather than by bags. It was originally designed to be built with simple tools and little experience, and this meant that the design was quite simple. For example, the characteristic &#x27;pram&#x27; front reduces the need for the more complicated curved wooden panels and joinery needed for a pointed bow, and a daggerboard is used instead of a hinged centreboard. The result is a robust, versatile and fairly light boat that can be easily maintained and repaired, and can also be launched into the water very quickly from storage or transport. Although most experienced sailors would carry a paddle rather than oars, if necessary it rows well. If the transom is strengthened, an outboard motor can be used for propulsion.

The original rig was a Gunter rig, but in 2006 the class rules were changed to allow a single mast and an alloy boom. Although a Bermudan sloop rig has now been introduced for the Mirror, the original Gunter rig (with a gaff that effectively doubles the height of the mast) meant that all the spars could be packed inside the hull for easy storage or transportation. This same space saving is still available with the Bermudan rig by using an optional two-piece aluminium mast. Mirrors can be sailed without a jib by moving the mast into an optional forward step and moving the shroud attachment points forward. However, in this configuration it can be difficult to tack, so it would mainly be used to de-power the boat for beginners. Most single handers retain the mast in the standard position and handle the jib as well: because of the Mirror&#x27;s small size, this is quite manageable.

Mirror class rules permit the use of a spinnaker. This may also be used by single handers as well - although flying a main, jib and spinnaker single-handed sounds complex, it is quite manageable with a bit of practice.

Mainsail controls permitted by the class are downhaul (Cunningham), outhaul and kicking strap (vang). The Jib tack fixing may also be adjustable while sailing allowing changes in jib luff tension and tack height.

The Mirror is light and stable enough to be sailed safely by two young teenagers or two adults. It is an excellent boat for children or teenagers learning sailing for the first time.

Richard Creagh-Osborne commented in the Dinghy Yearbook 1964 (pub. Adlard Coles) that the Mirror &#x27;was one of the two best one design dinghies drawn by Jack Holt - the other being the Heron&#x27;. Initially the design met with a considerable degree of scepticism from the established boating fraternity due to its unconventional design and construction (actually pioneered by Ken Littledyke for canoe construction) but Creagh-Osbourn and Beecher Moore were two of the highly respected pundits of the dinghy scene who were far sighted enough to see the value of the design, and immediately supported it. Within a few years its dramatically lower cost (only just over half the cost of the Heron or Gull) and massive promotion by the Daily Mirror (under the guidance of a dedicated team headed by Victor Shaw) transformed the boat into the most popular two man dinghy in terms of sales per annum worldwide. This was sadly relatively short lived, and the imposition of 25% VAT in the late 1970s on boats, killed the dinghy market and the sales of the Mirror - it never really recovered, and by the time the economy improved, its franchise of practical post war kit builders had been replaced by kids who had little understanding of the most basic woodworking skills and even less interest - it remains popular but not to the extent and enthusiasm that fostered the book &#x27;Mirrormania&#x27; in 1976.

==Racing==
Despite not being a particularly fast dinghy, the Mirror is popular for one-design racing. Because of the very large number that have been made, it is fairly easy to find other Mirror sailors to race against - at least in the countries where the Mirror is popular. The large fleet of similar boats coupled with the Mirror&#x27;s stability and relative complexity (for a boat of this size) make it the ideal boat to learn racing skills. It is a recommended UK Olympic pathway boat and many top sailors learned their trade in Mirrors. Mirrors are raced competitively worldwide.
The Mirror World Championship is contested biennially by the nations of Ireland, the UK, the Republic of South Africa, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Netherlands and Australia. Ireland has dominated the event over the past decade, winning the championship in 1999 (Marty Moloney and Revelin Minihane), 2001 (Peter Bayly and William Atkinson), 2003 (Chris Clayton and Craig Martin) and 2005 (Ross Kearney and Adam Mc Cullough) although the last two world championships have been won by British pairings. Anna Mackenzie and Holly Scott from team GBR were the first all-female team to win the title in 2007 which was contested in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Andy and Tom Smith also from Great Britain won the event in 2009 in Pwllheli, Wales.

Former world champion Ross Kearney won both the 2010 Mirror European championships at Sligo Yacht Club, and the 2011 Mirror World Championship held in Albany, Western Australia, with current crew Max Odell.

The 2013 World Championships were hosted at Lough Derg Yacht Club in Ireland.

The biggest event in the UK each year is Abersoch Mirror week, held in North Wales at S.C.Y.C.(www.scyc.co.uk). Abersoch Mirror week is an event for all sailors, from the very young and first time sailors to the mega keen adult, with boats from the 60s to brand new. In 2013 there were more Mirrors than the Nationals. In 2015 the 2015 Nationals were held alongside Abersoch Mirror week.

The UK Portsmouth Yardstick number for single handed racing is 1369, for racing with two crew the UK Portsmouth Yardstick number is 1383.

==Cruising==
Although in the racing world Mirrors are associated with youths and beginners, as a cruising/pleasure boat they are very practical for adults, even experienced and veteran sailors where modern racing dinghies are not practical. Compared to racing dinghies which tend to have low gunwales, are a wet ride, capsize easily, and cannot be rowed or motored; the Mirror is more like a traditional boat with relative comfort inside the cockpit, plenty of room for stowage, and both the crew and gear remain dry in light winds. In heavy winds, the hull form is very stable and this makes them very reliable for the more adventurous cruiser, knowing that capsize is less likely than racing boats of comparable size. Their small size and light weight means they are easy to handle, launch and recover, transport, tow, and store on land. They can be launched and recovered by hand from inhospitable places where cars and tractors are unable to go (eg deep mud estuaries, large beaches with gentle gradients, etc), which gives them an advantage over bigger dinghies. Their ability to take oars and an engine means that the cruising dinghy sailor can be self sufficient without relying on rescue boats in case of problems with the sails or rigging. With the right knowledge and equipment, Mirrors are suitable for cruising on rivers, lakes, and coastal waters; solo or in groups. Mainly used for day sailing but sometimes for multi-day passages, with boom tents allowing camping on the boat, or camping gear stowed to be used for camping ashore.

One has even been sailed and rowed singlehanded from Ellesmere to the Black Sea. Because there are so many of them around, it is fairly easy to find others to sail with. In bad weather, Mirrors remain easy to handle, though stronger winds may overwhelm them. Their seaworthiness is excellent for their size.

The Mirror with the sail No 1 (i.e. the first ever mirror) may be seen at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall.

==Other designs==
Three other dinghy designs are also associated with the &#x27;Mirror&#x27; name: the (Mirror) Miracle of 12 ft 8ins length, the Marauder (Mirror 14) (14 ft 6ins), and the Mirror 16 (16 ft 1ins). Of these, the Marauder was designed by Peter Milne, while the other two were Jack Holt designs. The Miracle also sports a squared-off &#x27;transom bow&#x27; (albeit smaller than that of the smaller Mirror), while the two larger designs enjoy a more traditional bow treatment. All of them were conceived as potential home-build projects, though the Marauder is a less obviously hard-chine design.

The rather larger GRP &#x27;Mirror Offshore&#x27; (a van de Stadt design), possibly in a similar spirit, was intended to enable an introduction to larger boats within a limited budget.

<doc id="383237" wikidata="Q543671" url="?curid=383237" title="Stephen Dedalus">
<text>Stephen Dedalus is James Joyce&#x27;s literary alter ego, appearing as the protagonist and antihero of his first, semi-autobiographic novel of artistic existence, &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; (1916), and as a major character in his 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Stephen mirrors many facets of Joyce&#x27;s own life and personality. Joyce was a talented singer, for example, and in &quot;Ulysses&quot; Leopold Bloom notes the excellence of Stephen&#x27;s tenor voice after hearing him sing Johannes Jeep&#x27;s song &quot;Von der Sirenen Listigkeit&quot;.

In Stephen Hero, an early version of &quot;A Portrait&quot;, Stephen&#x27;s surname is spelled &quot;Daedalus,&quot; a more obvious allusion to the mythological figure Daedalus, a brilliant artificer who constructed a pair of wings for himself and his son Icarus as a means of escaping the island of Crete, where they had been imprisoned by King Minos. Buck Mulligan makes reference to Stephen&#x27;s mythic namesake in Ulysses, telling him, &quot;Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!&quot; His surname also suggests his desire to &quot;fly&quot; above the constraints of religion, nationality, and politics in his development as an artist. Daedalus had been contracted by King Minos to build the Labyrinth in which he would imprison his wife&#x27;s son the Minotaur. Stephen&#x27;s surname may also reflect the labyrinthine quality of his developmental journey in &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.&quot; Stephen&#x27;s first name recalls the first Christian martyr. The theme of martyrdom runs throughout the novel.

==Fictional biography==
The childhood of Stephen Dedalus is recounted using vocabulary that changes as he grows, in a voice not his own but sensitive to his feelings. The reader experiences Stephen&#x27;s fears and bewilderment as he comes to terms with the world in a series of disjointed episodes. Stephen attends the Jesuit-run Clongowes Wood College, where the apprehensive, intellectually gifted boy suffers the ridicule of his classmates while he learns the schoolboy codes of behaviour. While he cannot yet grasp their significance, at a Christmas dinner he is witness to the social, political and religious tensions in Ireland involving Charles Stewart Parnell, which drive wedges between members of his family, leaving Stephen with doubts over which social institutions he can place his faith in. Back at Clongowes, word spreads that a number of older boys have been caught &quot;smugging&quot; (the term refers to the secret homosexual horseplay that five students were caught at); discipline is tightened, and the Jesuits increase use of corporal punishment. Stephen is strapped when one of his instructors believes he has broken his glasses to avoid studying. Prodded by his classmates, Stephen works up the courage to complain to the rector, Father Conmee, who assures him there will be no such recurrence, leaving Stephen with a sense of triumph.

Stephen&#x27;s father gets into debt and the family leaves its pleasant suburban home to live in Dublin. Stephen realises that he will not return to Clongowes. However, thanks to a scholarship obtained for him by Father Conmee, Stephen is able to attend Belvedere College, where he excels academically and becomes a class leader. Stephen squanders a large cash prize from school, and begins to see prostitutes, as distance grows between him and his drunken father.

As Stephen abandons himself to sensual pleasures, his class is taken on a religious retreat, where the boys sit through sermons. Stephen pays special attention to those on pride, guilt, punishment and the Four Last Things (death, judgement, Hell, and Heaven). He feels that the words of the sermon, describing horrific eternal punishment in hell, are directed at him and, overwhelmed, comes to desire forgiveness. Overjoyed at his return to the Church, he devotes himself to acts of ascetic repentance, though they soon devolve to mere acts of routine, as his thoughts turn elsewhere. His devotion comes to the attention of the Jesuits, and they encourage him to consider entering the priesthood. Stephen takes time to consider, but has a crisis of faith because of the conflict between his spiritual beliefs and his aesthetic ambitions. Along Dollymount Strand he spots a girl wading, and has an epiphany in which he is overcome with the desire to find a way to express her beauty in his writing.

As a student at University College, Dublin, Stephen grows increasingly wary of the institutions around him: Church, school, politics and family. In the midst of the disintegration of his family&#x27;s fortunes, his father berates him and his mother urges him to return to the Church. An increasingly dry, humourless Stephen explains his alienation from the Church and the aesthetic theory he has developed to his friends, who find that they cannot accept either of them. Stephen concludes that Ireland is too restrictive to allow him to express himself fully as an artist, so he decides that he will have to leave. He sets his mind on self-imposed exile, but not without declaring in his diary his ties to his homeland:

In &quot;Ulysses,&quot; Stephen is back in Dublin, having returned because his mother was dying. He refused to kneel at her deathbed, a memory that will haunt
him throughout the day. He is the character who corresponds to Telemachus; less overtly, he embodies aspects of Hamlet. He is the protagonist of the first three episodes. Subsequently, Leopold Bloom is introduced. The two will miss each other, not meeting until late in the novel.

Ovid described Daedalus in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (VIII:183–235) as being shut up in a tower to prevent his knowledge of the Labyrinth from spreading to the public. Stephen is introduced taking breakfast in the Sandycove Martello tower in Dublin on the morning of 16 June 1904. Stephen shares his opinions about religion, especially as they relate to the recent death of his mother, with his quasi-friend Buck Mulligan, who manages to offend Stephen before making plans as they part ways to go drinking later that evening. In the second episode Stephen teaches a class of boys a history lesson on ancient Rome. In the &quot;Proteus&quot; episode (in Greek myth Proteus was the old man of the sea and the shepherd of sea animals who knew all things past, present, and future but disliked telling what he knew), Stephen ambles along the strand as his thoughts are related in the form of an internal monologue. 

Following several episodes centering on Bloom, Stephen returns to the fore of the novel in the library episode, in which he expounds at length to some acquaintances his theory of the obscurely autobiographical nature of Shakespeare&#x27;s works and questions the institution of fatherhood, deeming it to be a fiction. He discredits his own ideas afterward, suggesting a lack of self-confidence.

Bloom visits the maternity hospital where Mina Purefoy is giving birth, and finally meets Stephen, who has been drinking with his medical student friends and is awaiting the promised arrival of Buck Mulligan. The young men become boisterous, and start discussing such topics as fertility, contraception and abortion. They continue on to a pub to continue drinking, following the successful birth of a son to Mina Purefoy. 

The episode is written as a play script, complete with stage directions. The action is frequently interrupted by &quot;hallucinations&quot; experienced by Stephen and Bloom—fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters. Stephen and his friend Lynch walk into Nighttown, Dublin&#x27;s red-light district. Bloom pursues them and eventually finds them at Bella Cohen&#x27;s brothel. Bloom sees Stephen overpay at the brothel, and decides to hold onto the rest of his money for safekeeping. Stephen hallucinates that his mother&#x27;s rotting cadaver has risen up from the floor to confront him. He cries &quot;Non serviam!,&quot; uses his walking stick to smash a chandelier, and flees the room. Bloom quickly pays Bella for the damage, then runs after Stephen. He finds Stephen engaged in an argument with an English soldier, Private Carr, who, after a perceived insult to the King, punches Stephen. The police arrive and the crowd disperses. As Bloom tends to Stephen, he has a hallucination of his deceased son, Rudy, as an 11-year-old.

Bloom takes Stephen to a cabman&#x27;s shelter near Butt Bridge to restore him to his senses. There, they encounter a drunken sailor, D. B. Murphy (W. B. Murphy in the 1922 text). The episode is dominated by the motif of confusion and mistaken identity, with Bloom, Stephen and Murphy&#x27;s identities being repeatedly called into question. Bloom returns home with Stephen, makes him a cup of cocoa, discusses cultural and linguistic differences between them, considers the possibility of publishing Stephen&#x27;s parable stories, and offers him a place to stay for the night. Stephen refuses Bloom&#x27;s offer and is ambiguous in response to Bloom&#x27;s proposal of future meetings. The two men urinate in the backyard, Stephen departs and wanders off into the night, and Bloom goes to bed, where Molly is sleeping. 

Hugh Kenner, writing in 1948, was critical of Stephen Dedalus, the protagonist of &quot;A Portrait&quot;, arguing that he “does not become an artist at all . . . but an aesthete” and “to take him seriously is very hard indeed.” Kenner lamented, “It is painful to be invited to close the book with an indigestibly Byronic hero stuck in our throats.”

A later version of Kenner’s 1948 essay appeared in his first book on Joyce published in 1955. 

Writing in 1959, William York Tindall was also critical of Stephen Dedalus, saying “he never sees himself entirely.” Tindall regretted Stephen’s “failure to realize himself,” adding that “this is attended to in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which makes &quot;A Portrait&quot; seem preliminary sketch.”

In 1963 S. L. Goldberg took issue with Kenner’s negative appraisal of Stephen, conceding that “Mr. Kenner is certainly right in pointing to the irony with which Joyce views him in both the &quot;Portrait&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot;,” but faulting him for concluding that in doing so Joyce is rejecting Stephen himself. For Goldberg, Joyce’s “irony is a qualifying criticism, which does not imply a total rejection.”

It has been argued that Joyce used the doctrines of the Incarnation cited early in &quot;Ulysses&quot; to characterize his relation to both Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom and their relation to each other. Two of the doctrines have been linked to signify that Stephen, though a separate person, shares Joyce’s nature and that Joyce speaks through him. His Hamlet theory is a continuation of his aesthetic theory in &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.&quot;

== Quotations ==

When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets.

:—&quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,&quot; Chapter 5

A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.

:—&quot;Ulysses,&quot; Episode 9

Welcome, O life, I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race. Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in good stead.

:—&quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;

History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.

:—&quot;Ulysses,&quot; Episode 2

I fear those big words that make us so unhappy.

:—&quot;Ulysses,&quot; Episode 2

Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me.

:—&quot;Ulysses,&quot; Episode 3

<doc id="383238" wikidata="Q7334069" url="?curid=383238" title="Rikki (Japanese singer)">
<text>, professionally known as , is a Japanese folk singer.

Born in Amami Ōshima, Japan, she began to sing traditional Japanese music when she was four years old. Later, at the age of 15, Rikki was the youngest winner ever to win the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; of the Japanese traditional folk music awards (known as All Japan Minyo awards). She first performed in Tokyo, Japan, at the prestigious Festival Konda Lota in 1992. She released her first single &quot;Maten no Hoshi&quot; (which means &#x27;Sky Full of Stars&#x27;) in December 1993, originally released in the Kyūshū region of Japan. Shortly thereafter, she produced her debut album, .

In 1998, Rikki was chosen to participate at the opening ceremony of the 1998 Winter Paralympics in Nagano, Japan, to sing the Paralympics theme song &quot;&quot;.

Rikki sang the &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; main theme, &quot;Suteki da ne&quot;, released as a single on July 18, 2001. The single also included an instrumental version of &quot;&quot;, &quot;Pure Heart&quot; (a vocal arrangement of Aeris&#x27; Theme from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;), and a new song entitled &quot;&quot; (which means &#x27;The Moon&#x27;).

In 2001, she produced an image album alongside Joe Hisaishi for the motion picture &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (directed by Hayao Miyazaki).

In 2006, Rikki joined the band Sound Horizon for the release of &quot;5th Story CD: Roman&quot;. She was involved in Sound Horizon&#x27;s releases until 2008, when she gave birth to twins and returned to Amami Ōshima, as she said in her blog. She returned to Sound Horizon in 2009 for their Triumph III live tour. She also returned to Sound Horizon in 2015 for the album &quot;9th Story Nein&quot;.

<text>The Treaty of London (; also known as the Second Treaty of London) was proposed by England, accepted by France, and signed in 1359. After Edward the Black Prince soundly defeated the French at Poitiers (during the Hundred Years&#x27; War), where they captured John II of France, the French king was forced to accept the terms of the English. Based on the terms of the accord, England was permitted to annex much of western France, including Normandy, Anjou, Maine, Aquitaine within its ancient limits, Calais and Ponthieu, as well as suzerainty over the Duchy of Brittany. This would restore the ancient territories of Henry II, and in full sovereignty rather than as a fief. In addition, France would pay a ransom of four million écus for the king.

However, the treaty was later repudiated on 25 May by the French Estates-General, which felt that too much territory was being relinquished. This resulted in a fresh English invasion by Edward III, marching from Calais in November 1359. While the French were unwilling to meet Edward in battle, his sieges of Reims and Paris were unsuccessful, and the weak situation of his army led him to reopen negotiations. The English were forced to accept revised terms more favourable to the French and ultimately received Aquitaine and Calais, without Normandy or Brittany, and a reduced ransom in the Treaty of Brétigny.

<text>The Treaty of London (), signed on 18 August O.S. (28 August N.S.) 1604, concluded the nineteen-year Anglo-Spanish War. The treaty restored the &quot;status quo&quot; between the two nations. The negotiations probably took place at Somerset House in Westminster and are sometimes known as the Somerset House Conference.

==Background==
The Anglo-Spanish War had been a complex and fluctuating conflict that also had connections with the Dutch Revolt, the French Wars of Religion, and the Nine Years&#x27; War in Ireland. The war by 1600 had been going on for nearly fifteen years with neither side gaining an overall benefit or a decisive advantage. The exhaustion of Spain, the rebellious opposition to the King&#x27;s request for money, the mutinies of the troops in the Netherlands, and the fear of a renewal of a new war with France over the Duchy of Saluzzo all combined to emphasise the hopelessness of inflicting a vital blow on England.

===Early peace proposals===
In April 1600, Archduke Albert, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, opened secret negotiations with England for a settlement but did not inform Madrid. The following month, negotiations culminated in a meeting of a conference at Boulogne between representatives of Spain, England and Burgundy. Spain demanded the cession of the Cautionary Towns. England demanded free trade with Spain and her empire, freedom of English subjects from the inquisition and the exclusive right of having warships in the channel. The talks got nowhere, Spain contended that it was absurd to expect the sovereign of a worldwide empire to give the &quot;pas&quot; to a queen of a few islands. By August the talks were off –
mutual distrust and United Provinces pressure made any agreement impossible. Despite this however diplomatic routes were open between England, Albert, and his wife, Isabella Clara Eugenia (Philip&#x27;s sister). Letters from representatives showed that Albert, Isabella Clara Eugenia, and Philip were still anxious for peace despite their difference in policies. Philip wanted to preserve the hegemony of the Spanish empire, whilst the Archduke and Isabella sought peace and friendly relations.

The concern of the government in Madrid was to improve their dire military situation in the Netherlands by reducing or stopping English help to the Dutch rebels. Meanwhile, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, heading the delegation of the States of Holland, tried to attract the complicity of the new English monarch in the conflict in Flanders, of which the focus was the Siege of Ostend. The siege had become a struggle of bloody attrition after just over two years. Spain had also sent a 4th Spanish Armada in 1601, the town of Kinsale was held, and besieged by English forces led by the Earl of Mountjoy. This ended in defeat when Kinsale surrendered in 1602. The defeat thus weakened Spanish resolve in the war against England.

After the death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603, her successor, James I, quickly sought to end the long and draining conflict. By this time Spanish hopes of a decisive military victory in the Netherlands, or a successful invasion of England, were relatively remote. James was an idealistic practitioner of Christian peace and unity and also the son and successor to Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the conflict. Philip III of Spain had also inherited the war from his predecessor, Philip II, and his treasuries had also been drained and so he warmly welcomed the offer and ordered the commencement of the difficult negotiations that followed.

The first moves towards peace were taken in June 1603, when Juan de Tassis headed a Spanish–Flemish Commission which visited London, seeking truces and mutual good faith. Tassis was despatched to England by Philip III of Spain to explore the possibilities for a settlement following Elizabeth&#x27;s death.

Archduke Albert had already sent his envoy Charles de Ligne, prince-count of Arenberg, to London and was joined by Juan de Tassis, in September 1603. Although De Tassis lacked full negotiating powers he was active behind the scene the following month in preparation for a settlement.

==Treaty==
At the end of 1603, the constable of Castile arrived in Brussels with the authorisation to conclude the treaty if one could be negotiated. On 19 May 1604, with the constable still waiting in the wings, the rest of the Habsburg delegation arrived in London and the English negotiating team was appointed. The meetings took place in Somerset House, probably in the hall used by the Queen&#x27;s council.

===English delegation===
* Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury (1563–1612), Secretary of State, James I&#x27;s leading minister
* Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devonshire (1563–1606), soldier
* Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset (1536–1608), Lord Treasurer
* Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton (1540–1614), Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.
* Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham (1536–1624), Lord High Admiral

===Spanish delegations===
The Spanish negotiated with two delegations, one representing the King of Spain, the other the Archdukes Albert and Isabella, rulers of the Spanish Netherlands.

Spanish delegation:
* Juan Fernández de Velasco y Tovar, 5th Duke of Frías, Constable of Castile
* Juan de Tassis, 1st Count of Villamediana
* Alessandro Robida, Senator of Milan, leading negotiator in London in the absence of the Constable of Castile.

Delegation of the Spanish Netherlands:
* Charles de Ligne, 2nd Prince of Arenberg
* Jean Richardot, President of the Brussels Privy Council
* Louis Verreyken, Audiencier of Brussels

===Terms===
* Spain recognizes the Protestant monarchy of England and renounces intentions to restore the Church of Rome in the country. 
* An end to Spanish military intervention in Ireland.
* An end to English disruption to Spanish trans-Atlantic shipping and colonial expansion (article 6).
* The English Channel opened to Spanish shipping.
* An end to English intervention in the Dutch Revolt (articles 4,5,7); England withdraws military and financial support to the Dutch rebels.
* Ships of both countries, merchants or warships, could use the mainland seaports of the other party for refit, shelter or buy provisions (article 10). Fleets of less than eight ships did not even have to ask for permission, which provided an extensive network of naval bases for the Spaniards in England to help their war against the Protestant Dutch.

The treaty was signed on 28 August (New Style), at Whitehall Palace, by the Constable of Castile who was lodged at Somerset House. The treaty restored the status quo ante bellum. It amounted to an acknowledgement by Spain that its hopes of restoring Roman Catholicism in England were at an end and it had to recognise the Protestant monarchy in England. In return, England ended its financial and military support for the Dutch rebellion, ongoing since the Treaty of Nonsuch (1585), and had to end its wartime disruption of Spanish trans-Atlantic shipping and colonial expansion.

==Aftermath==
With England out of the way, the Spanish hoped for a knock-out blow that would force the Dutch into a peace by launching a huge campaign led by Ambrogio Spinola in 1606. James still allowed the Dutch army to recruit English volunteer soldiers in their service – 8,000 having served in the Netherlands in 1605. In addition, English corsairs were now finding their needs in the service of the Dutch, who preyed on Spanish shipping. Conversely, Spanish warships and privateers were allowed to use English ports as naval bases to attack Dutch shipping or to transport reinforcements to Flanders. In November 1607, the costs of the recent wars with France, the Protestant Dutch as well as England resulted in Spain&#x27;s bankruptcy. The Twelve Years&#x27; Truce was thus signed, which formally recognized the independence of the Dutch Republic.
To the English public, the treaty was highly unpopular, viewing it as a &quot;humiliating peace&quot;. They felt that the King had deserted their ally the Netherlands in order to appease the Spanish, and it made James I &quot;monumentally unpopular&quot;. Noel Caron, ambassador of the United Provinces to London, wrote that &quot;no promulgation was ever received in London with more coolness, yes—with more sadness.&quot; As such no public celebrations were held in England after the conclusion of the agreement. The rift between James I&#x27;s foreign policy and public opinion would widen some years later as a result of the &quot;Spanish Match&quot;, when the Protestant House of Commons would confront the King over his marriage arrangement between Maria Anna of Spain (the daughter of Philip III of Spain) and James&#x27;s son, Charles, the Prince of Wales. The English delegation, however, considered the treaty with Spain a diplomatic victory which gave the English &quot;peace with honour&quot;. After the signing lavish celebrations organised by the 3rd Earl of Southampton including a grand feast and ball were laid on at the Palace of Whitehall. Gold and silver medals designed by Nicholas Hilliard were also struck to commemorate the peace.

The peace agreement was well received in Spain. There were big public celebrations in the Spanish capital Valladolid from April to June 1605 in honour of the treaty and of the birth of Philip&#x27;s son Philip IV of Spain. Also present were the English ambassadorial delegation (which numbered 500) led by Lord Admiral Charles Howard. He had been sent by James I in return for Don Juan de Velasco having been sent to England to negotiate the peace the previous year. The English delegation were welcomed with a warm reception and honours on 26 May which included Howard being received at the English college. The treaty was then ratified in the Royal Palace of Valladolid in the presence of Howard the following month. Some voices from the Catholic Church, however, expressed its concern to Philip III over his settlement with a &quot;heretical power&quot;, especially Juan de Ribera, then bishop of Valencia who protested. Once the agreement was concluded, Philip III appointed Don Pedro de Zuñiga as first Spanish resident ambassador to England.

For the Spanish crown, there was hope after the peace treaty that England would eventually secure tolerance for Catholics. The Gunpowder Plot in 1605, however, destroyed any possibility of this. Protestant fears that a peace with Spain would ultimately mean an invasion by Jesuits and Catholic sympathisers over the coming years also failed to materialise as the Elizabethan Recusancy laws were rigidly enforced by Parliament.

Following the signing of the treaty, England and Spain remained at peace until 1625.

<text>Ethel Barrymore (born Ethel Mae Blythe; August 15, 1879 – June 18, 1959) was an American actress and a member of the Barrymore family of actors. Barrymore was a stage, screen and radio actress whose career spanned six decades, and was regarded as &quot;The First Lady of the American Theatre&quot;. She received four nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, winning for &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot; (1944).

==Early life==

Barrymore was born Ethel Mae Blythe in Philadelphia, the second child of the actors Maurice Barrymore (whose real name was Herbert Blythe) and Georgiana Drew. She was named for her father&#x27;s favorite character in William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;The Newcomes.&quot;

She was the sister of actors John and Lionel Barrymore, the aunt of actor John Drew Barrymore and great-aunt of actress Drew Barrymore. She was a granddaughter of actress and theater manager Louisa Lane Drew and niece of Broadway matinée idol John Drew, Jr. and Vitagraph Studios stage and screen star Sidney Drew.

She spent her childhood in Philadelphia and attended Roman Catholic schools there.

In 1884, the family moved to England for two years. Barrymore&#x27;s father exhibited a play and starred on stage plays at London&#x27;s Haymarket Theatre. Returning to the U.S. in 1886, her father took her to her first baseball game which established her lifelong love of baseball.

==Career==

In the summer of 1893, Barrymore was in the company of her mother Georgie, who had been ailing from tuberculosis and took a curative sabbatical to Santa Barbara, California, not far from where family friend Helena Modjeska had a retreat. Georgie did not recover and died in July 1893 at age 36. Essentially Ethel&#x27;s and Lionel&#x27;s childhood ended when Georgie died; they were forced to go to work in their teens with neither finishing high school. John, a few years younger, stayed with their grandmother and other relatives. Barrymore&#x27;s first appearance on Broadway was in 1895, in a play called &quot;The Imprudent Young Couple&quot; which starred her uncle John Drew Jr. and Maude Adams. She appeared with Drew and Adams again in 1896 in &quot;Rosemary&quot;.

In 1897 Ethel went with William Gillette to London to play Miss Kittridge in Gillette&#x27;s &quot;Secret Service&quot;. She was about to return to the States with Gillette&#x27;s troupe when Henry Irving and Ellen Terry offered her the role of Annette in &quot;The Bells&quot;. A full London tour was on and, before it was over, Ethel created, on New Year&#x27;s Day 1898, Euphrosine in &quot;Peter the Great&quot; at the Lyceum, the play having been written by Irving&#x27;s son, Laurence. Men everywhere were smitten with Ethel, most notably Winston Churchill, who asked her to marry him. Not wishing to be a politician&#x27;s wife, she refused. Winston, years later, married Clementine Hozier, who looked very much like Ethel. Winston and Ethel remained friends until the end of her life.
After her season in London, Ethel returned to the U.S. Charles Frohman cast her first in &quot;Catherine&quot; and then as Stella de Grex in &quot;His Excellency the Governor&quot;. After that, Frohman finally gave Ethel the role that would make her a star: Madame Trentoni in &quot;Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines&quot;, which opened at the Garrick Theatre in London&#x27;s West End on February 4, 1901. Unbeknownst to Ethel, her father Maurice had witnessed the performance as an audience member and walked up to his daughter, congratulated her and gave her a big hug. It was the first and only time he saw her on stage professionally. When the tour concluded in Boston in June, she had out-drawn two of the most prominent actresses of her day, Mrs. Patrick Campbell and Minnie Maddern Fiske.

Following her triumph in &quot;Captain Jinks&quot;, Ethel gave sterling performances in many top-rate productions and it was in Thomas Raceward&#x27;s &quot;Sunday&quot; that she uttered what would be her most famous line, &quot;That&#x27;s all there is, there isn&#x27;t any more.&quot;

She portrayed Nora in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; by Ibsen (1905), and Juliet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; by Shakespeare (1922).

==Actors&#x27; Equity strike==
Barrymore, along with friend Marie Dressler, was a strong supporter of the Actors&#x27; Equity Association and had a high-profile role in the 1919 strike. During the strike, Ethel and Lionel Barrymore starred in a benefit show staged by AEA at the Lexington Avenue Opera House. AEA came into being primarily to allow performers to have a bigger share in the profits of stage productions and to provide benefit to elderly or infirm actors. Barrymore&#x27;s involvement in AEA may have been motivated by the fate of both of her parents, both long standing actors, her mother who had needed proper medical care and her father who required years of institutionalized care. Her support for the strike angered many producers and cost Barrymore her friendship with George M. Cohan, an actor, songwriter and producer.

==1920–1930s==

In 1926, she scored one of her greatest successes as the sophisticated spouse of a philandering husband in W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s comedy, &quot;The Constant Wife&quot; (Maugham counted himself among her admirers, saying that during rehearsals for the play he had &quot;fallen madly in love with her.&quot;) She starred in &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot; (1932), playing the czarina married to Czar Nicholas. In July 1934, she starred in the play &quot;Laura Garnett&quot;, by Leslie and Sewell Stokes, at Dobbs Ferry, New York.

After she became a stage star, she would often dismiss adoring audiences who kept demanding curtain calls by saying &quot;That&#x27;s all there is—there isn&#x27;t any more!&quot; This became a popular catch phrase in the 1920s and 1930s. Many references to it can be found in the media of the period, including the Laurel and Hardy 1933 film &quot;Sons of the Desert&quot;, and Arthur Train&#x27;s 1930 Wall Street Crash novel &quot;Paper Profits&quot;. It is sometimes recalled on modern day radio stations annually every August 15 when Ethel&#x27;s birthday is mentioned.

Barrymore was a baseball and boxing fan. Her admiration for boxing ended when she witnessed the brutality of the July 4, 1919, Dempsey/Willard fight in which Dempsey broke Willard&#x27;s jaw and knocked out several of his teeth. Ethel vowed never to attend another boxing match, though she would later watch boxing on television.

In 1928, the Shuberts opened the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, which operates under that name to the present day.

In 1938, Ethel became the first artistic director of the Olney Theatre Center in Olney, Maryland.

==Film and broadcasting career==

===Film===
Barrymore appeared in her first feature motion picture, &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, in 1914. Members of her family were already in pictures; uncle Sidney Drew, his wife Gladys Rankin, and Lionel had entered films in 1911 and John made his first feature in 1913 after having debuted in Lubin short films in 1912. She made 15 silent pictures between 1914 and 1919, most of them for the Metro Pictures studio. Most of these pictures were made on the East Coast, as her Broadway career and children came first. A few of her silent films have survived: for example, one reel from &quot;The Awakening of Helena Richie&quot; (1916) which survives at the Library of Congress, and &quot;The Call of Her People&quot; (1917) held at the George Eastman House.

The only two films that featured all three siblings—Ethel, John, and Lionel—were &quot;National Red Cross Pageant&quot; (1917) and &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot; (1932). The former film is now considered a lost film.

Barrymore won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot; (1944) opposite Cary Grant, but made plain that she was not overly impressed by it.

She appeared in &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (1946) directed by Robert Siodmak, &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947) directed by Alfred Hitchcock, in which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for both as well for the 1949 film &quot;Pinky&quot;. She played the repressed wife of Charles Laughton&#x27;s character. Another important role of hers was in &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Red Danube&quot; (1949), among others. Her last film appearance was in &quot;Johnny Trouble&quot; (1957).

===Radio===
Barrymore was heard on radio in 1923 when the first act of &quot;The Laughing Lady&quot;, in which she was appearing, was broadcast to an estimated 750,000 listeners.

Barrymore starred in &quot;Miss Hattie&quot;, described as &quot;a short-lived situation comedy,&quot; on ABC in 1944–1945. In one episode, Barrymore&#x27;s character was &quot;asked by Rob Thompson to direct a play which the workers of his war plant are presenting in order to raise money for war bonds.&quot; Barrymore starred, along with Gene Kelly, in the June 1, 1949, episode of Suspense, entitled &quot;To Find Help&quot;.

===Television===
Barrymore also made a number of television appearances in the 1950s, including one memorable encounter with comedian Jimmy Durante on NBC&#x27;s &quot;All Star Revue&quot; on December 1, 1951, which is preserved on a kinescope. In 1956, she hosted 14 episodes of the TV series &quot;Ethel Barrymore Theatre&quot;, produced by the DuMont Television Network and presented on the DuMont flagship station WABD just as the network was folding. Unfortunately none of the episodes were preserved on kinescope. A 1952 appearance on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; survives, however, in addition to several radio broadcasts.

==Popular culture==
In the romantic time travel film &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (1980), a photo of Barrymore wearing nun&#x27;s habit from her 1928 play &quot;The Kingdom of God&quot; can be seen. Christopher Reeve plays a journalist rummaging through old theater albums at a large Michigan hotel. He uncovers the photos of Barrymore in the play and childhood photos of actresses Blanche Ring and Rose Stahl.
In the musical film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), Barrymore is held up as an example of a lofty actress when Gene Kelly mocks Debbie Reynolds in a squabble about what makes a serious actor. He repeats the humorous taunt when Reynolds jumps out of a giant cake as a show girl.

==Personal life==

Winston Churchill was among Barrymore&#x27;s many new friends in England. Churchill proposed to her in 1900, and while Barrymore mentioned no such proposal in her autobiography, she included a photograph of herself and Churchill on the lawn at Blenheim Palace in 1899. While touring in England at age 19, she was rumored to be engaged to the Duke of Manchester, actor Gerald du Maurier, writer Richard Harding Davis and Churchill. She was engaged to Laurence Irving, son of Sir Henry Irving, but the couple did not marry.

Barrymore married Russell Griswold Colt (1882–1960) on March 14, 1909. The couple had three children: Samuel Colt (1909–1986), actress and singer Ethel Barrymore Colt (1912–1977), and John Drew Colt (1913–1975).

Barrymore campaigned for the reelection of President Herbert Hoover in 1932.

==Death==
Ethel Barrymore died of cardiovascular disease on June 18, 1959, at her home in Hollywood, after having lived for many years with a heart condition. She was less than two months shy of her 80th birthday. She was entombed at Calvary Cemetery. The Ethel Barrymore Theatre in New York City is named for her.

==Honors==
In 1960, Barrymore was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star for her contributions to the film industry. Her star is located at 7001 Hollywood Boulevard. Barrymore was a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame, along with her brothers, John and Lionel.

A crater on the planet Venus is named for Barrymore.

<doc id="383250" wikidata="Q616951" url="?curid=383250" title="Treaty of London (1827)">
<text>The Treaty of London (, ) was signed in London on 6 July, 1827 by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Bourbon Restoration France and the Russian Empire. The three main European powers had called upon Greece and the Ottoman Empire to cease hostilities that had been going on since the Greeks revolted against the Ottoman rule on 17 March 1821. After years of negotiation, the European allied powers had finally decided to intervene in the war on the side of the Greeks. The Allied powers wanted the treaty mainly to cause the Ottoman Empire to create an independent Greek state. It stated that while the Ottoman Empire would recognise the independence of Greece, the Ottoman Sultan would be the supreme ruler of Greece. The treaty declared the intention of the three allies to mediate between the Greeks and the Ottomans. The base arrangement was that Greece would become an Ottoman dependency and pay tribute as such. Additional articles were added to detail the response if the Sultan refused the offer of mediation and continued hostilities in Greece. The articles detailed that the Turks had one month to accept the mediation or the Allied powers forming a partnership with the Greeks through commercial relations. Measures were also adopted that if the Sultan refused the armistice, the Allies would use the appropriate force to ensure the adoption of the armistice.

However, the Ottoman Empire, basing its decision upon its supposedly-superior naval force, declined to accept the treaty. The Treaty of London allowed the three European powers to intervene on behalf of the Greeks. At the naval Battle of Navarino, on 20 October 1827, the Allies crushed the combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleet in an overwhelming victory that forcefully and effectively created an independent Greek state.

The Treaty of London also bound Russia to a promise not to attempt any territorial aggrandisement at the expense of Turkey or secure any exclusive commercial advantage from Turkey as the result of any subsequent Russian war with Turkey. The war between Russia and Turkey, anticipated by the treaty, actually broke out in June 1828 when Russian troops crossed the Danube into the Ottoman controlled province of Dobruja. The war became the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829. The Treaty of Adrianople, signed by Russia and Turkey on 14 September 1829, ended the Russo-Turkish War. Besides recognising the independence of Greece, Turkey was forced by the treaty to give the Danube Delta and its islands and a considerable portion of the Black Sea south of the Kuban estuary to Russia. Because of the new territorial arrangements and the other articles contained in the treaty, Britain and the other European powers came to regard the Treaty of Adrianople as infringing on the promises that Russia had made in the Treaty of 1827.

<doc id="383252" wikidata="Q212286" url="?curid=383252" title="P. W. Botha">
<text>Pieter Willem Botha, ( , ; 12 January 1916 – 31 October 2006) was a South African politician. Nicknamed &#x27;Die Groot Krokodil&#x27; (Afrikaans for &#x27;The Big Crocodile&#x27;) due to his tough political stance, he was the head of government of South Africa from 1978 to 1989, serving as the last prime minister of South Africa from 1978 to 1984 and the first executive state president of South Africa from 1984 to 1989. 

First elected to Parliament in 1948, Botha, an Afrikaner nationalist, was an opponent of black majority rule and international communism. However, his administration did make concessions towards political reform, whereas internal unrest saw widespread human rights abuses at the hands of his government. Botha resigned as leader of the ruling National Party (NP) in February 1989 after suffering a stroke and six months later was also coerced to leave the presidency.

In F. W. de Klerk&#x27;s 1992 apartheid referendum, Botha campaigned for a No vote and denounced De Klerk&#x27;s administration as irresponsible for opening the door to black majority rule. In early 1998, when Botha refused to testify at the Mandela government&#x27;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), he was supported by the Conservative Party, which had earlier contested his rule as the official opposition. For his refusal, he was fined and given a suspended jail sentence, which was overturned on appeal due to a technicality.

==Personal life==
===Early life and education===
Pieter Willem Botha was born on a farm in the Paul Roux district of the Orange Free State Province (now Free State Province), the son of Afrikaner parents. His father, Pieter Willem Botha Sr., fought as a commando against the British in the Second Boer War. His mother, Hendrina Christina Botha (née de Wet), was interned in a British concentration camp during the war.
Botha initially attended the Paul Roux School and matriculated from Bethlehem Voortrekker High School. In 1934, he entered the Grey University College (now the University of the Free State) in Bloemfontein to study law, but left early at the age of twenty in order to pursue a career in politics. He began working for the National Party as a political organiser in the neighbouring Cape Province. In the run-up to World War II, Botha joined the Ossewabrandwag, an Afrikaner nationalist group which was sympathetic to the German Nazi Party; but months after the German attack on the USSR, Botha condemned the Ossewabrandwag and changed his ideological allegiance to Christian nationalism.

===Family===
In 1943, Botha married Anna Elizabeth Rossouw (Elize). The couple had five children; two sons (Piet and Rossouw) and three daughters (Elsa, Amelia and Rozanne). In the 1980s, Rozanne Botha, emerged as a minor celebrity figure in the country. She released Afrikaans pop songs and appeared on the covers of magazines such as &quot;Sarie&quot; and &quot;Style&quot;, where she was dubbed &quot;First Daughter of the Land&quot;.

In 1998, he married Barbara Robertson, a legal secretary 25 years his junior, following Elize&#x27;s death the previous year.

In 2022, two of his daughters died. Amelia Paschke, died in a car crash driving back from Betty&#x27;s Bay. In the same year, Rozanne also died, of cancer.

==Parliamentary career==
At age 30, Botha was elected head of the National Party Youth in 1946, and two years later was elected to the House of Assembly as representative of George in the southern Cape Province in the general election which saw the beginning of the National Party&#x27;s 46-year tenure in power. His opponent in the 1948 election was JP Marais from the United Party. In 1958 Botha was appointed Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs by Hendrik Verwoerd, and in 1961 was appointed to the new Department of Coloured Affairs and became Minister of Community Development. In 1966, Botha was appointed Minister of Defence by Verwoerd and served under the government of John Vorster, upon Verwoerd&#x27;s murder later that year. Under his 14 years in charge of the ministry, the South African Defence Force (SADF) reached a zenith, at times consuming 20% of the national budget, compared to 1.3% in 1968, and was involved in the South African Border War. 

Botha was keen to promote constitutional reform, and hoped to implement a form of federal system in South Africa that would allow for greater &quot;self-rule&quot; for black homelands (or Bantustans), while still retaining the supremacy of a white central government, and foremost expand the rights of Coloureds (South Africans of mixed ancestry) and Asians in order to widen support for the government. Upon enacting the reforms, he remarked in the House of Assembly; &quot;&quot;We must adapt or die&quot;.&quot;

As Prime Minister and later State President, Botha&#x27;s greatest parliamentary opponents were Harry Schwarz and Helen Suzman of the Progressive Federal Party until 1987, when his former cabinet colleague Andries Treurnicht&#x27;s new Conservative Party became the official opposition on a strictly anti-concessionist agenda.

In 1977, as Minister of Defence, Botha began a secret nuclear weapons program, which culminated in the manufacture of six nuclear bombs, destroyed only in the early 1990s. He remained steadfast in South Africa&#x27;s administration of neighbouring territory South-West Africa, particularly while there was a presence of Cuban troops in Angola to the north. Botha was responsible for introducing the notorious Koevoet police counter-insurgency unit. He was also instrumental in building the SADF&#x27;s strength, adding momentum to establishing units such as 32 Battalion. South African intervention, with support of the rebel UNITA movement (led by Dr. Jonas Savimbi, a personal friend), in the Angolan Civil War continued until the late 1980s, terminating with the Tripartite Accord. To maintain the nation&#x27;s military strength, a very strict draft was implemented to enforce compulsory military service for white South African men.

===Prime Minister (1978-1984)===
When Prime Minister John Vorster resigned following allegations of his involvement in the Muldergate Scandal in 1978, Botha was elected as his successor by the National Party caucus, besting the electorate&#x27;s favourite, 45-year-old Foreign Minister Pik Botha. In the final internal ballot, he beat Connie Mulder, the scandal&#x27;s namesake, in a 78–72 vote. On 5 December 1978, he was absolved in a judicial report of blame in the scandal. 

Upon becoming Prime Minister, Botha retained the defence portfolio until October 1980, when he appointed SADF Chief General Magnus Malan, his successor. From his ascension to the cabinet, Botha pursued an ambitious military policy designed to increase South Africa&#x27;s military capability. He sought to improve relations with the West – especially the United States – but with mixed results. He argued that the preservation of the apartheid government, though unpopular, was crucial to stemming the tide of African Communism, which had made in-roads into neighbouring Angola and Mozambique after these two former Portuguese colonies obtained independence.

In one of his first moves as Prime Minister, he appointed Piet Koornhof as minister responsible for black affairs. Koornhof, who joined the ANC in the post-apartheid era, was regarded as one of the most reform‐minded ministers in the government. Botha had led a campaign to demolish Crossroads, a high-density township in Cape Town in 1978. Amid significant opposition, Botha and Koornhof agreed to &quot;indefinitely delay&quot; the demolitions.

A challenge he faced within his first two months in office was the election of Andries Treurnicht as leader of the Transvaal province. Treurnicht was vocally opposed to apartheid reforms and now had a power base controlling a strong majority of seats in the all-white parliament. The election highlighted differences between Afrikaners in Botha&#x27;s Cape Province and Treurnicht&#x27;s. In the former, there was a higher level of tolerance towards racial groups, with attitudes mostly formed by contact with Cape Coloureds. Botha had in 1974 said that the Nico Malan Theatre should be open to patrons of all races. However, he was opposed to blacks becoming a majority in the Western Cape and sought demolitions of unplanned black townships.

In January 1979, he became the first premier to visit Robben Island, known primarily as a prison for mostly black political prisoners. He declined to say whether he had met with any of the prisoners, stating that it was a &quot;routine&quot; visit. In April of the same year, Botha offered military and economic support to Abel Muzorewa&#x27;s incoming government for Zimbabwe Rhodesia. Botha held high-level talks with Muzorewa in June 1979.

In the weeks leading up to the 1981 South African general election, he was confronted by hard-line Afrikaner hecklers, some of whom were supporters of the Herstigte Nasionale Party, resisting to changes to the status quo of apartheid. On the final night of the campaign trail, Botha vowed that &quot;As long as there is a National Party Government, we won&#x27;t hand over South-West Africa to the authority of SWAPO.&quot; In the election, his party garnered 58% of the all-white vote and 131 seats. This was down from 65% and 134 seats in the 1977 South African general election, with the party losing votes to the Herstigte Nasionale Party. 

In April 1981, the passport of Desmond Tutu was seized. Tutu on visits to Europe and the United States, called for economic pressure on South Africa to make Botha&#x27;s government enter into negotiations with the country&#x27;s leadership. Botha was angered by these visits and had vowed to seize Tutu&#x27;s passport. In the same year, he authorised Operation Beanbag, a series of raids by the South African Defence Force against safe houses of uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), armed wing of the ANC in Mozambique. 

In February 1982, he survived a significant challenge to his leadership from Andries Treurnicht. He was able to secure 172 votes versus 36 on a motion of support in his leadership and his route of power-sharing with other racial groups.

On 22 April 1983, Botha announced a special commission to consider repealing the Immorality Act and the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949. Botha said: &quot;I am personally opposed to immoral practices, but the Government does not see these two laws as guarantees for the survival of South Africa,&quot;.

On 19 May 1983, South Africa was the subject of resolutions taken by the International Press Institute condemning the &quot;continued harassment and persecution&quot; of the media in South Africa. The institute appealed to Botha to &quot;to accept press freedom as a prerequisite for a country that regards itself as part of the democratic world.&quot; The institute also cited the increasing difficulty for foreign journalists to obtain visas to report and work from South Africa. The resolution also highlighted the forthcoming trials of journalists, Allister Sparks, his wife, Suzanne and Bernard Simon. The charges against all three were dropped in March 1984.

In May 1983 he condemned the Church Street, Pretoria bombing committed by uMkhonto weSizwe, saying that it confirmed &quot;that we are dealing with a Communist-inspired onslaught.&quot;

In 1983, Botha proposed a new constitution, which was then put to a vote of the white population on 2 November. The constitution was endorsed by the white electorate.

Though it did not implement a federal system, it implemented what was ostensibly a power-sharing agreement with Coloureds and Indians. The new constitution created two new houses of parliament alongside the existing, white-only House of Assembly—the House of Representatives for Coloureds and the House of Delegates for Indians. The three chambers of the new Tricameral Parliament had sole jurisdiction over matters relating to their respective communities. Legislation affecting &quot;general affairs,&quot; such as foreign policy and race relations, had to pass all three chambers after consideration by joint standing committees. At the time, White South Africans outnumbered Coloureds and Indians together, hence preserving white dominance within the framework of a &quot;power-sharing&quot; system.

The plan included no chamber or system of representation for the black majority. Each Black ethno-linguistic group was allocated a &#x27;homeland&#x27; which would initially be a semi-autonomous area. However, blacks were legally considered citizens of the Bantustans, not of South Africa, and were expected to exercise their political rights there. Bantustans were expected to gradually move towards a greater state of independence with sovereign nation status being the final goal. During Botha&#x27;s tenure, Ciskei, Bophutatswana and Venda all achieved nominal sovereignty and nationhood, which were only recognised by each other and by South Africa . These new countries, set up within the borders of South Africa, never gained international recognition, and economically all remained heavily dependent on South Africa. Over half of the Bantustans, most notably KwaZulu led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, rejected independence due to their leaders&#x27; commitment to opposing apartheid from within.

The new constitution also changed the executive branch from the parliamentary system that had been in place in one form or another since 1910, to a presidential system. The prime minister&#x27;s post was abolished, and its functions were merged with those of the state president, which became an executive post with sweeping powers. In a departure from general presidential systems, however, the president was to be elected not by universal suffrage (or white suffrage) but by an electoral college, whose members were elected by the three chambers of the Parliament. The state president and cabinet had sole jurisdiction over &quot;general affairs&quot;. Disputes between the three chambers regarding &quot;general affairs&quot; were resolved by the President&#x27;s Council, composed of members from the three chambers and members directly appointed by the state president. In practice, the composition of the President&#x27;s Council and the electoral college made it impossible for the Coloured and Indian chambers to outvote the white chamber on any substantive matter, even if they voted as a bloc. Thus, the real power remained in white hands — and in practice, in the hands of Botha&#x27;s National Party, which commanded a large majority in the white chamber due to the first past the post voting system. Only with the challenge posed by the Conservative Party, which was &quot;against&quot; the reforms due to the fears of apartheid breaking up, was the Botha&#x27;s position put in question. 

The new constitution was criticised by the black majority for failing to grant them any formal role in government. The African National Congress and Chief Buthelezi were among its opponents. Their stand was supported by many coloured, white and Indian groups, including the official opposition, the Progressive Federal Party. Although many international commentators such as the Reagan Administration praised it as a &quot;first step&quot; in what was assumed to be a series of reforms.

===State President (1984-1989)===
On 14 September 1984, Botha was elected as the first state president under the newly approved constitution.

Implementing the presidential system was seen as a key step in consolidating Botha&#x27;s personal power. In previous years, he had succeeded in getting a number of strict laws that limited freedom of speech through parliament, and thus suppressed criticism of government decisions. States of emergencies became frequent, including extrajudicial killings either during riots or through special forces, such as the Koevoet. 

In many western countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom (where the Anti-Apartheid Movement was based) and the Commonwealth, there was much debate over the imposition of economic sanctions in order to weaken Botha and undermine the white regime. By the late 1980s – as foreign investment in South Africa declined – disinvestment began to have a serious effect on the nation&#x27;s economy.

State President Botha&#x27;s loss of influence can be directly attributed to decisions taken at the Ronald Reagan/Mikhail Gorbachev summit of the leaders of the US and the Soviet Union in Moscow (29 May – 1 June 1988) that paved the way to resolving the problem of Namibia which, according to foreign minister Pik Botha, was destabilising the region and &quot;seriously complicating&quot; the major issue which South Africa itself would shortly have to face. Soviet military aid would cease and Cuban troops be withdrawn from Angola as soon as South Africa complied with UN Security Council Resolution 435 by relinquishing control of Namibia and allowing UN-supervised elections there. The Tripartite Agreement, which gave effect to the Reagan/Gorbachev summit decisions, was signed at UN headquarters in New York on 22 December 1988 by representatives of Angola, Cuba and South Africa.

On 18 January 1989, Botha (then aged 73) suffered a mild stroke which prevented him from attending a meeting with Namibian political leaders on 20 January 1989. Botha&#x27;s place was taken by acting president J. Christiaan Heunis. On 2 February 1989, Botha resigned as leader of the National Party (NP), anticipating his nominee – finance minister Barend du Plessis – would succeed him. Instead, the NP&#x27;s parliamentary caucus selected as leader education minister F. W. de Klerk, who moved quickly to consolidate his position within the party as a reformist, while hardliners supported Botha. In March 1989, the NP elected De Klerk as state president but Botha refused to resign, saying in a television address that the constitution entitled him to remain in office until March 1990 and that he was even considering running for another five-year term. Following a series of acrimonious meetings in Cape Town, and five days after UNSCR 435 was implemented in Namibia on 1 April 1989, Botha and De Klerk reached a compromise: Botha would retire after the parliamentary elections in September, allowing de Klerk to take over as state president.

However, Botha abruptly resigned from the state presidency on 14 August 1989, complaining that he had not been consulted by De Klerk over his scheduled visit to see President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia:
:&quot;The ANC is enjoying the protection of president Kaunda and is planning insurgency activities against South Africa from Lusaka&quot;, Botha declared on nationwide television. He said he had asked the cabinet what reason he should give the public for abruptly leaving office. &quot;They replied I could use my health as an excuse. To this, I replied that I am not prepared to leave on a lie. It is evident to me that after all these years of my best efforts for the National Party and for the government of this country, as well as the security of our country, I am being ignored by ministers serving in my cabinet.&quot;

De Klerk was sworn in as acting state president on 14 August 1989 and the following month was nominated by the electoral college to succeed Botha in a five-year term as state president. De Klerk soon announced the removal of legislation against anti-apartheid groups – including the African National Congress – and the release of Nelson Mandela. De Klerk&#x27;s term saw the dismantling of the apartheid system and negotiations that eventually led to South Africa&#x27;s first racially inclusive democratic elections on 27 April 1994.

In a statement on the death of Botha in 2006, De Klerk said:
:&quot;Personally, my relationship with P. W. Botha was often strained. I did not like his overbearing leadership style and was opposed to the intrusion of the State Security Council system into virtually every facet of government. After I became leader of the National Party in February 1989, I did my best to ensure that P. W. Botha would be able to end his term as president with full dignity and decorum. Unfortunately, this was not to be.&quot;

==Apartheid government==

Botha undertook some changes to apartheid practices, but these were rejected by many as superficial and inadequate. He legalised interracial marriage and miscegenation, both completely banned since the late 1940s. The constitutional prohibition on multiracial political parties was lifted. He also relaxed the Group Areas Act, which barred non-whites from living in certain areas. In 1988, a new law created &quot;Open Group Areas&quot; or racially mixed neighbourhoods but these neighbourhoods had to receive a Government permit, had to have the support of the local whites immediately concerned, and had to be an upper-class neighbourhood in a major city in order to be awarded a permit. In 1983, the aforementioned constitutional reforms granted limited political rights to &quot;Coloureds&quot; and &quot;Indians&quot;. Botha also became the first South African government leader to authorise contacts with Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the African National Congress (ANC).

Even these meagre reforms went too far for a group of NP hardliners, led by former Education Minister Andries Treurnicht. In 1982, the group broke away to form the Conservative Party. However, they did not even begin to meet the demands of the opposition. In the face of rising discontent and violence, Botha refused to cede political power to blacks and imposed greater security measures against anti-apartheid activists. Botha also refused to negotiate with the ANC.

In 1985, Botha delivered the Rubicon speech, a policy address in which he refused to give in to demands by the black population, including the release of Mandela. Botha&#x27;s defiance of international opinion further isolated South Africa, leading to economic sanctions and a rapid decline in the value of the rand. The following year, when the United States introduced the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, Botha declared a nationwide state of emergency. He is famously quoted during this time as saying, &quot;This uprising will bring out the beast in us&quot;.

As economic and diplomatic actions against South Africa increased, civil unrest spread amongst the black population, supported by the ANC and neighbouring black-majority governments. On 16 May 1986, Botha publicly warned neighbouring states against engaging in &quot;unsolicited interference&quot; in South Africa&#x27;s affairs. Four days later, Botha ordered air strikes against selected targets in Lusaka, Harare, and Gaborone, including the offices of exiled ANC activists. Botha charged that these raids were just a &quot;first installment&quot; and showed that &quot;South Africa has the capacity and the will to break the [ANC].&quot;

In spite of the concessions made by Botha, his rule was still very repressive. Thousands were detained without trial during Botha&#x27;s tenure, while others were tortured and killed. The TRC found Botha responsible for gross violations of human rights. He was also found to have directly authorised &quot;unlawful activity which included killing.&quot; Botha declined to apologise for apartheid. In a 2006 interview to mark his 90th birthday, he suggested that he had no regrets about the way he had run the country. Botha denied that he had ever considered black South Africans to be in any way inferior to whites, but conceded that &quot;some&quot; whites did hold that view. He also claimed that the racial segregation laws of apartheid &quot;started in Lord Milner’s time&quot; and the National Party merely inherited them; however, Botha conceded that the Afrikaner population had been &quot;happy to perpetuate [apartheid]&quot;, as many of them &quot;were, and some of them still are... &#x27;racists at heart&#x27;&quot;.

==Post-presidency==
Botha and his wife Elize retired to their home, &quot;Die Anker&quot;, in the town of Wilderness, from the city of George and located on the Indian Ocean coast of the Western Cape. Elize died in 1997 after a heart attack. He was briefly engaged to Reinette Water Naude, an independently wealthy woman 31 years his junior. However, on 22 June 1998, he married Barbara Robertson, a legal secretary 25 years his junior.

Botha remained largely out of sight of the media and it was widely believed that he remained opposed to many of F. W. de Klerk&#x27;s reforms. He resigned from the Afrikaner Broederbond.

Then-president Nelson Mandela arranged a dinner with Botha&#x27;s daughters, Rozanne and Elsa, and their husbands. Mandela had hoped to lobby the family so that they would persuade Botha to testify at the new government&#x27;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), set up to expose apartheid-era crimes and chaired by his cultural and political nemesis, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. There was no unanimous agreement between the family, with Rozanne vocally opposed, believing that her father could face prosecution and/or humiliation in the court.
The TRC found that he had ordered the 1988 bombing of the South African Council of Churches headquarters in Johannesburg. In August 1998, he was fined and given a suspended jail sentence for his refusal to testify on human rights violations and violence sanctioned by the State Security Council (SSC) which he, as president until 1989, had directed.

In June 1999, Botha successfully appealed to the High Court against his conviction and sentence. The Court&#x27;s ruling by Judge Selikowitz (with Judge Foxcroft concurring) found that the notice served on Botha to appear before the TRC was technically invalid.

===Death and funeral===
Botha died of a heart attack at his home in Wilderness on Tuesday 31 October 2006, aged 90. His death was met with magnanimity by many of his former opponents. Former President Nelson Mandela was reported as saying &quot;while to many Mr. Botha will remain a symbol of apartheid, we also remember him for the steps he took to pave the way towards the eventual peacefully negotiated settlement in our country&quot;.

President Thabo Mbeki announced that flags would be flown at half mast to mark the death of a former head of state. The offer of a state funeral was declined by Botha&#x27;s family, and a private funeral was held on 8 November in the town of George, where Botha&#x27;s body was buried. Mbeki attended the funeral.

<text>The French Navy (, , ), informally (, ), is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces and one of the four military service branches of France. It is among the largest and most powerful naval forces in the world recognised as being a blue-water navy. The French Navy is capable of operating globally and conducting expeditionary missions, maintaining a significant overseas presence. The French Navy is one of eight naval forces currently operating fixed-wing aircraft carriers, with its flagship being the only nuclear-powered aircraft carrier outside the United States Navy, and one of two non-American vessels to use catapults to launch aircraft.

Founded in the 17th century, the French Navy is one of the oldest navies still in continuous service, with precursors dating back to the Middle Ages. It has taken part in key events in French history, including the Napoleonic Wars and both world wars, and played a critical role in establishing and securing the French colonial empire for over 400 years. The French Navy pioneered several innovations in naval technology, including the first steam-powered ship of the line, first seagoing ironclad warship, first mechanically propelled submarine, first steel-hulled warship, and first armoured cruiser.

The French Navy consists of six main components: the Naval Action Force, the Submarine Forces (FOST and ESNA), French Naval Aviation, the Navy Riflemen (including Naval Commandos), the Marseille Naval Fire Battalion, and the Maritime Gendarmerie. As of 2021, the French Navy employed 44,000 personnel (37,000 military and 7,000 civilian), more than 180 ships, 200 aircraft, and six commandos units; as of 2014, its reserve element numbered roughly 48,000.

It operates a wide range of fighting vessels, including various aeronaval forces, attack and ballistic missile submarines, frigates, patrol boats and support ships, with aircraft carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; serving as the centerpiece of most expeditionary forces.

== Origins ==
The history of French naval power dates back to the Middle Ages, and had three loci of evolution:
* The Mediterranean Sea, where the &quot;Ordre de Saint-Jean de Jérusalem&quot; had its own navy, the Levant Fleet, whose principal ports were Fréjus, Marseille, and Toulon. The &quot;Ordre&quot;, which was both a religious and military order, recruited knights from the families of French nobility. Members who had fulfilled their service at sea were granted the rank of Knights Hospitaller, elites who served as the officer corps. The &quot;Ordre&quot; was one of the ancestors of modern French naval schools including the French Naval Academy.
* The Manche along Normandy which, since William the Conqueror, always tendered capable marines and sailors from its numerous active seaports.
* The Atlantic Ocean, where the navy of the Duchy of Brittany eventually constituted the nucleus of the royal &quot;Flotte du Ponant,&quot; which projected French naval power across the Atlantic and the Americas.

== Names and symbols ==
The first true French Royal Navy () was established in 1626 by Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister to King Louis XIII. During the French Revolution, was formally renamed . Under the First French Empire and the Second French Empire, the navy was designated as the Imperial French Navy (). Institutionally, however, the navy has never lost its short familiar nickname, .

The original symbol of the French Navy was a golden anchor, which, beginning in 1830, was interlaced by a sailing rope; this symbol was featured on all naval vessels, arms, and uniforms. Although anchor symbols are still used on uniforms, a new naval logo was introduced in 1990 under Naval Chief of Staff Bernard Louzeau, featuring a modern design that incorporates the tricolour—by flanking the bow section of a white warship with two ascending red and blue spray foams—and the inscription &quot;&quot;.

== History ==


=== 17th century ===
Cardinal Richelieu personally supervised the Navy until his death in 1643. He was succeeded by his protégé, Jean Baptiste Colbert, who introduced the first code of regulations of the French Navy and established the original naval dockyards in Brest and Toulon. Colbert and his son, the Marquis de Seignelay, between them administered the Navy for twenty-nine years.

During this century, the Navy cut its teeth in the Anglo-French War (1627–1629), the Franco-Spanish War (1635–59), the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Franco-Dutch War, and the Nine Years&#x27; War. Major battles in these years include the Battle of Augusta, Battle of Beachy Head, the Battles of Barfleur and La Hougue, the Battle of Lagos, and the Battle of Texel.

=== 18th century ===
The 1700s opened with the War of the Spanish Succession, over a decade long, followed by the War of the Austrian Succession in the 1740s. Principal engagements of these wars include the Battle of Vigo Bay and two separate Battles of Cape Finisterre in 1747. The most grueling conflict for the Navy, however, was the Seven Years&#x27; War, in which it was virtually destroyed. Significant actions include the Battle of Cap-Français, the Battle of Quiberon Bay, and another Battle of Cape Finisterre.

The Navy regrouped and rebuilt, and within 15 years it was eager to join the fray when France intervened in the American Revolutionary War. Though outnumbered everywhere, the French fleets held the British at bay for years until victory. After this conflict and the concomitant Anglo-French War (1778–1783), the Navy emerged at a new height in its history. Major battles in these years include the Battle of the Chesapeake, the Battle of Cape Henry, the Battle of Grenada, the invasion of Dominica, and three separate Battles of Ushant.

Within less than a decade, however, the Navy was decimated by the French Revolution when large numbers of veteran officers were dismissed or executed for their noble lineage. Nonetheless, the Navy fought vigorously through the French Revolutionary Wars as well as the Quasi-War. Significant actions include a fourth Battle of Ushant (known in English as the Glorious First of June), the Battle of Groix, the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, the French expedition to Ireland, the Battle of Tory Island, and the Battle of the Nile.

=== 19th century ===
Other engagements of the Revolutionary Wars ensued in the early 1800s, including the Battle of the Malta Convoy and the Algeciras Campaign. The Quasi-War wound down with single-ship actions including USS &quot;Constellation&quot; vs &quot;La Vengeance&quot; and USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; vs &quot;Flambeau&quot;.

When Napoleon was crowned Emperor in 1804, he attempted to restore the Navy to a position that would enable his plan for an invasion of England. His dreams were dashed by the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where the British all but annihilated a combined Franco-Spanish fleet, a disaster that guaranteed British naval superiority throughout the Napoleonic Wars. Still, the Navy did not shrink from action: among the engagements of this time were the Battle of the Basque Roads, the Battle of Grand Port, the Mauritius campaign of 1809–11, and the Battle of Lissa.

After Napoleon&#x27;s fall in 1815, the long era of Anglo-French rivalry on the seas began to close, and the Navy became more of an instrument for expanding the French colonial empire. Under King Charles X, the two nations&#x27; fleets fought side by side in the Battle of Navarino, and throughout the rest of the century they generally behaved in a manner that paved the way for the Entente Cordiale.

Charles X sent a large fleet to execute the invasion of Algiers in 1830. The next year, his successor, Louis Philippe I, made a show of force against Portugal at the Battle of the Tagus, and in 1838 conducted another display of gunboat diplomacy, this time in Mexico at the Battle of Veracruz. Beginning in 1845, a five-year Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata was imposed on Argentina over trade rights.

The Emperor Napoleon III was determined to follow an even stronger foreign policy than his predecessors, and the Navy was involved in a multitude of actions around the world. He joined in the Crimean War in 1854; major actions for the Navy include the siege of Petropavlovsk and the Battle of Kinburn. The Navy was heavily involved in the Cochinchina Campaign in 1858, the Second Opium War in China, and the French intervention in Mexico. It took part in the French expedition to Korea and the Shimonoseki campaign. In the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the Navy imposed an effective blockade of Germany, but events on land proceeded at such a rapid pace that it was superfluous. Isolated engagements between French and German ships took place in other theaters, but the war was over in a matter of weeks.

The Navy continued to protect colonial safety and expansion under the French Third Republic. The Sino-French War saw considerable naval action including the Battle of Fuzhou, the Battle of Shipu, and the Pescadores Campaign. In Vietnam, the Navy helped wage the Tonkin Campaign which included the Battle of Thuận An, and it later participated in the Franco-Siamese conflict of 1893.

The 19th century French Navy brought forth numerous new technologies. It led the development of naval artillery with its invention of the highly effective Paixhans gun. In 1850, became the first steam-powered ship of the line in history, and became the first seagoing ironclad warship nine years later. In 1863, the Navy launched , the first submarine in the world to be propelled by mechanical power. In 1876, became the first steel-hulled warship ever. In 1887, became the world&#x27;s first armoured cruiser.

During the latter part of the century, French officers developed the so-called &quot;Jeune École&quot; (Young School) theory that emphasized the use of small, cheap torpedo boats to destroy expensive battleships, coupled with long-range commerce raiders to attack an opponent&#x27;s merchant fleet.

===20th century===
The first seaplane, the French Fabre Hydravion, was flown in 1910, and the first seaplane carrier, , was christened in the following year. Despite that innovation, the general development of the French Navy slowed down in the beginning of the 20th century as the naval arms race between Germany and Great Britain grew in intensity.

It entered World War I with relatively few modern vessels, and during the war few warships were built because the main French effort was on land. While the British held control of the North Sea, the French held the Mediterranean, where they mostly kept watch on the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The largest operations of the Navy were conducted during the Dardanelles Campaign. In December 1916, during the Noemvriana events, French warships also bombarded Athens, trying to force the pro-German government of Greece to change its policies. The French Navy also played an important role in countering Germany&#x27;s U-boat campaign by regularly patrolling the seas and escorting convoys.

Between the World Wars, the Navy modernized and expanded significantly, even in the face of limitations set by the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. New additions included the heavy and fast &quot;super-destroyers&quot;, the battleships, and the submarine which was the largest and most powerful of its day.

From the start of World War II, the Navy was involved in a number of operations, participating in the Battle of the Atlantic, the Norwegian Campaign, the Dunkirk evacuation and, briefly, the Battle of the Mediterranean. However, after the fall of France in June 1940, the Navy was obligated to remain neutral under the terms of the armistice that created the truncated state of Vichy France. Worldwide, some 100 naval vessels and their crews heeded General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s call to join forces with the British, but the bulk of the fleet, including all its capital ships, transferred loyalty to Vichy French Navy (Marine de Vichy). Concerned that the German Navy might somehow gain control of the ships, the British mounted an attack on Mers-el-Kébir, the Algerian city where many of them were harbored. The incident poisoned Anglo-French relations, leading to Vichy reprisals and a full-scale naval battle at Casablanca in 1942 when the Allies invaded French North Africa. But the confrontations were set aside once the Germans occupied Vichy France. The capital ships were a primary goal of the occupation, but before they could be seized they were scuttled by their own crews. A few small ships and submarines managed to escape in time, and these joined de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French Naval Forces, an arm of Free France that fought as an adjunct of the Royal Navy until the end of the war. In the Pacific theatre as well, Free French vessels operated until the Japanese capitulation; was present at the Japanese Instrument of Surrender.

The Navy later provided fire support and troop transport in the Indochina War, the Algerian War, the Gulf War, and the Kosovo War.

Since 2000, the Navy has given logistical support to the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) as well as the global War on Terror. In 2011, it assisted Opération Harmattan in Libya.

==Organisation==
The chief of the naval staff is Vice-admiral d’escadre Arnaud de Tarlé, and as of 2014 the Navy has an active strength of 36,776 military personnel and 2,909 civilian staff. The Navy is organised into four main operational branches:
* The Force d&#x27;Action Navale (Naval Action Force) – Surface fleet.
* The Forces Sous-marines (Submarine forces) – Nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines and fleet submarines.
* The Aviation Navale (Naval air force) – Ground and sea-based aircraft.
* The Fusiliers Marins (Naval riflemen) – Protection force and infantry including the Navy special forces (Commandos Marine).

In addition, the National Gendarmerie of France maintain a maritime force of patrol boats that falls under the operational command of the French Navy:
* The Gendarmerie maritime – The coast guard of France.

During most of the Cold War, the Navy was organised in two squadrons based in Brest and Toulon, commanded by ALESCLANT (&quot;Amiral commandant l&#x27;escadre de l&#x27;Atlantique&quot;) and ALESCMED (&quot;Amiral commandant l&#x27;escadre de la Méditerranée&quot;) respectively. Since the post-Cold War restructuring process named Optimar &#x27;95, the two components have been divided into the Naval Action Force (commanded by ALFAN) and the Antisubmarine Group (commanded by ALGASM).

===Main naval bases===
As of 2014, the largest French naval base is the military port of Toulon. Other major bases in metropolitan France are the Brest Arsenal and Île Longue on the Atlantic, and Cherbourg Naval Base on the English Channel. Overseas French bases include Fort de France and Degrad des Cannes in the Americas; Port des Galets and Dzaoudzi in the Indian Ocean; and Nouméa and Papeete in the Pacific. In addition, the navy shares or leases bases in foreign locales such as Abu Dhabi, Dakar and Djibouti.

==Equipment==

===Ships and submarines===
Although French naval doctrine calls for two aircraft carriers, the French only have one, . Originally a planned order for French aircraft carrier PA2 was based on the design of the British recently constructed and launched for the British Royal Navy. However, the French programme had been delayed several times for budgetary reasons and the result was priority being given to the more exportable FREMM project. In April 2013 it was confirmed that the second aircraft carrier project would be abandoned due to defence cuts announced in the 2013 French White Paper on Defence and National Security.

The French Navy operates three amphibious assault ships, ten air defence and anti-submarine frigates, five general purpose frigates and has a commitment to six fleet submarines (SSNs). These vessels, with the aircraft carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, constitute the French Navy&#x27;s main ocean-going war-fighting force, while the four ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) of the navy&#x27;s Strategic Oceanic Force provide the backbone of the French nuclear deterrent.

In addition the French Navy operates six light surveillance frigates and, as of 2024, five avisos (originally light corvettes now reclassified as patrol vessels). They undertake the navy&#x27;s offshore patrol duties, the protection of French naval bases and territorial waters, and can also provide low-end escort capabilities to any oceangoing task force. The Navy also operates a fleet of offshore and coastal patrol vessels, mine countermeasures vessels as well as auxiliaries and support ships.

===Aircraft===

The French Naval Aviation is officially known as the &quot;Aéronautique navale&quot; and was created on the 19 June 1998 with the merging of Naval patrol aircraft and aircraft carrier squadrons. It has a strength of around 6,800 civilian and military personnel operating from four airbases in Metropolitan France. The Aéronavale has been modernized with 40 Rafale fighters which operate from the aircraft carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;.

==Personnel==
=== Application requirement ===
====Seamen====
Seamen must be at least 17 but no more than 30 years old, with no minimum level of schooling.

Petty officers must be at least 17 but no more than 30 years old, with at least a high school diploma giving access to university studies.

Petty Officer Candidate begin training with five months at the Petty Officer School of Maistrance at Brest.

====Contract officers====
Contract officers serve on an initial eight-year contract, renewable up to 20 years.
* Operational officers must be 21 to 26 years old, with at least a Bachelor of Science degree, or having passed a classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles in engineering or business.
* Staff officers have to be 21 to 29 years old, with an honors degree or master&#x27;s degree in a field corresponding to the military occupational specialty.

==Customs and traditions==

===Ranks===
The rank insignia of the French Navy are worn on shoulder straps of shirts and white jackets, and on sleeves for navy jackets and mantels. Until 2005, only commissioned officers had an anchor on their insignia, but enlisted personnel are now receiving them as well. Commanding officers have titles of &quot;capitaine&quot;, but are called &quot;commandant&quot; (in the army, both &quot;capitaine&quot; and &quot;commandant&quot; are ranks, which tends to stir some confusion among the public). The two highest ranks, &quot;vice-amiral d&#x27;escadre&quot; and &quot;amiral&quot; (admiral), are functions, rather than ranks. They are assumed by officers ranking &quot;vice-amiral&quot; (vice admiral). The only &quot;amiral de la flotte&quot; (Admiral of the Fleet) was François Darlan after he was refused the dignity of &quot;amiral de France&quot; (Admiral of France). Equivalent to the dignity of Marshal of France, the rank of &quot;amiral de France&quot; remains theoretical in the Fifth Republic; it was last granted in 1869, during the Second Empire, but retained during the Third Republic until the death of its bearer in 1873. The title of &quot;amiral de la flotte&quot; was created so that Darlan would not have an inferior rank than his counterpart in the British Royal Navy, who had the rank of Admiral of the Fleet.

====Commissioned officer ranks====
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
====Other ranks====
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
===Addressing officers===
Unlike in the French Army and Air and Space Force, one does not prepend &quot;mon&quot; to the name of the rank when addressing an officer (that is, not &quot;mon capitaine,&quot; but simply &quot;capitaine&quot;).

===Uniforms===


===Military music===

The main military musical unit of the French Navy is the Military Band of the Toulon Fleet (), founded on 13 July 1827. The Bagad Lann Bihoue, based on the bagad bands in Bretagne, is currently the sole pipe band in the service of the French Navy, which uses bagpipes and bombards, and thus is affiliated to the band.

In Canada, French naval music has affected the traditions of Canadian navy bands. French navy bands in the country date back to the era of New France. Musical units were primarily attached to the Compagnies Franches de la Marine and the Troupes de la marine, the former of which maintained two drums (tambour) and a fife.

==Future==

France&#x27;s financial problems have affected all branches of her military. The 2013 French White Paper on Defence and National Security cancelled the long-planned new aircraft carrier and a possible fourth . The backbone of the fleet will be the &quot;Aquitaine&quot;-class FREMM anti-submarine frigates, replacing the , but plans to buy a possible seventeen FREMMs were cut back to eleven and then to eight. The cancellation of the third and fourth Horizon destroyers meant that the last two FREMM hulls, which entered service between 2021 and 2023, are fitted out as FREDA air-defence ships to replace the . DCNS has shown a FREMM-ER concept to meet this requirement, emphasising ballistic missile defence with the Thales Sea Fire 500 AESA radar. Industrial considerations mean that the funds for FREMMs 9-11 are now being spent on five more exportable &quot;Frégate de Défense et d&#x27;Intervention&quot; (&quot;FDI&quot;, &quot;intermediate size frigates&quot;) from 2024 to supplement, and ultimately replace, the &quot;La Fayette&quot; class, three of which are being upgraded with new sonars to operate into the early 2030s. With respect to support ships, the are being replaced under the FLOTLOG project by up to four derivatives of Italy&#x27;s , with three being delivered from 2023 to 2027. A fourth potential ship is delayed until after 2030.

Construction has started on the first of six Barracuda-class nuclear attack submarines; commissioning of &quot;Suffren&quot; took place in 2020. These nuclear attack submarines are to be followed in the 2030s by the incremental introduction of a new class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) whose construction began in 2024.

The first MM40 Exocet Block 3 missile was test-fired in 2010 to be produced. Naval versions of the &quot;SCALP EG&quot; land-attack cruise missile are under development, along with a planned Aster Block 1NT with greater capabilities against ballistic missiles.

In October 2018, the French Ministry of Defence launched an 18-month study for €40 million for the eventual future replacement of the aircraft carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; beyond 2030. A decision to build the new carrier was taken by President Emmanuel Macron in 2020 and once it enters service it is anticipated to remain in service until beyond 2080. Construction of the new carrier is to begin in around 2025 with service entry anticipated in the latter 2030s.

<text>The Russian Navy is the naval arm of the Russian Armed Forces. It has existed in various forms since 1696. Its present iteration was formed in January 1992 when it succeeded the Navy of the Commonwealth of Independent States (which had itself succeeded the Soviet Navy following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late December 1991).

The Imperial Russian Navy was established by Peter the Great (Peter I) in October 1696. The symbols of the Russian Navy, the St. Andrew&#x27;s ensign (seen to the right), and most of its traditions were established personally by Peter I.

The Russian navy possesses the vast majority of the former Soviet naval forces, and currently comprises the Northern Fleet, the Pacific Fleet, the Black Sea Fleet, the Baltic Fleet, the Caspian Flotilla, the permanent task force in the Mediterranean, Naval Aviation, and the Coastal Troops (consisting of the Naval Infantry and the Coastal Missile and Artillery Troops).

The Russian navy suffered severely with the collapse of the Soviet Union due to insufficient maintenance, lack of funding, and subsequent effects on the training of personnel and timely replacement of equipment. Another setback was attributed to Russia&#x27;s domestic shipbuilding industry, which was in decline due to the absence of modern hardware and technology.

In 2013, a rise in gas and oil prices enabled a sort of renaissance of the Russian Navy due to increased available funds, which may have allowed Russia to begin &quot;developing the capacity to modernize&quot;. In August 2014, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that Russian naval capabilities would be bolstered with new weapons and equipment within the next six years in response to the enlargement of NATO and the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War.

 the non-operational aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov is the Russian Navy&#x27;s only carrier leaving the Russian Navy without an operational aircraft carrier. Further, reports that the &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;&#x27;s crew of ca. 1500 has been reassigned to the Russian Army for combat duty in Ukraine indicates that there is no plan to make the Russian Navy a carrier navy again.

==History==

 The 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a severe decline in the Russian Navy. Defence expenditures were severely reduced. Many ships were scrapped or laid up as accommodation ships at naval bases, and the building program was essentially stopped. Sergey Gorshkov&#x27;s buildup during the Soviet period had emphasised ships over support facilities, but Gorshkov had also retained ships in service beyond their effective lifetimes, so a reduction had been inevitable in any event. The situation was exacerbated by the impractical range of vessel types which the Soviet military-industrial complex, with the support of the leadership, had forced on the navy—taking modifications into account, the Soviet Navy in the mid-1980s had nearly 250 different classes of ship.

The &quot;Kiev-&quot;class aircraft carrying cruisers and many other ships were prematurely retired, and the incomplete second &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;-class aircraft carrier &quot;Varyag&quot; was eventually sold to the People&#x27;s Republic of China by Ukraine. Funds were only allocated for the completion of ships ordered prior to the collapse of the USSR, as well as for refits and repairs on fleet ships taken out of service since. However, the construction times for these ships tended to stretch out extensively: in 2003 it was reported that the &quot;Akula&quot;-class submarine &quot;Nerpa&quot; had been under construction for fifteen years.

Storage of decommissioned nuclear submarines in ports near Murmansk became a significant issue, with the Bellona Foundation reporting details of lowered readiness. Naval support bases outside Russia, such as Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam, were gradually closed, with the exception of the modest technical support base in Tartus, Syria to support ships deployed to the Mediterranean. Naval Aviation declined as well from its height as Soviet Naval Aviation, dropping from an estimated 60,000 personnel with some 1,100 combat aircraft in 1992 to 35,000 personnel with around 270 combat aircraft in 2006. In 2002, out of 584 naval aviation crews only 156 were combat ready, and 77 ready for night flying. Average annual flying time was 21.7 hours, compared to 24 hours in 1999.

Training and readiness also suffered severely. In 1995, only two missile submarines at a time were being maintained on station, from the Northern and Pacific Fleets. The decline culminated in the loss of the Oscar II-class submarine &quot;Kursk&quot; during the Northern Fleet summer exercise that was intended to back up the publication of a new naval doctrine. The exercise was to have culminated with the deployment of the &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; task group to the Mediterranean.

As of February 2008, the Russian Navy had 44 nuclear submarines with 24 operational; 19 diesel-electric submarines, 16 operational; and 56 first and second rank surface combatants, 37 operational. Despite this improvement, the November 2008 accident on board the attack boat &quot;Nerpa&quot; during sea trials before lease to India represented a concern for the future.

The strength and quality of the Russian Navy started to improve during the 2010s. From 2010-2014 Russian officials negotiated the purchase of four s. On 3 September 2014, French President announced that due to Russia&#x27;s &quot;recent actions in Ukraine&quot;, the two ships would not be delivered. In November 2014, François Hollande placed a hold on the delivery of the first &quot;Mistral&quot; to Russia in view of the conflict in east Ukraine. Hollande set two conditions for delivery: the observation of a ceasefire in Ukraine and a political agreement between Moscow and Kiev. On 5 August 2015 it was announced that France was to pay back Russia&#x27;s partial payments and keep the two ships initially produced for Russia. The ships eventually were sold to Egypt.

In 2012, as part of an ambitious rebuilding effort, President Vladimir Putin announced a plan to build 51 modern ships and 24 submarines by 2020. Of the 24 submarines, 16 were to be nuclear-powered. On 10 January 2013, the Russian Navy finally accepted its first new Borei-class SSBN () for service. A second Borei (&quot;Aleksandr Nevskiy&quot;) was undergoing sea trials and entered service on 21 December 2013.

A third &quot;Borei&quot;-class boat () was launched and began trials in early 2013, and was commissioned in late 2014. As of early 2022, five Borei-class boats are in service, along with three nuclear attack submarines. More vessels of these classes are building along with additional and Improved-Kilo-class conventional attack submarines. The surface fleet is also being modernized, principally by introducing at least six new classes of corvette/offshore patrol vessels, a new class of frigate (the &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot; class), as well as new classes of amphibious ships and support vessels. In 2019, total tonnage of the Russian Navy stood at 1,216,547 tonnes.

=== Invasion of Ukraine and losses ===

In 2022, the Russian Navy took part in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, starting with the attack on Snake Island at the beginning of the war, at which the Ukrainian defenders told the , flagship of the Black Sea; &quot;Russian warship, go fuck yourself&quot;, before subsequently being captured by Russian forces. &quot;Moskva&quot; sank on 14 April 2022 after a fire broke out and forced the crew to evacuate. The Ukrainian military reported that they hit the ship with Neptune anti-ship missiles, however the Russian military did not confirm this. The ship subsequently capsized and sank while the Russian Navy was attempting to tow her into port. The sinking of &quot;Moskva&quot; is the most significant Russian naval loss in action since World War II. In December 2023, the Russian landing ship Novocherkassk was also destroyed after being hit by Ukrainian cruise missiles.

On 31 January 2024, Ukrainian sea drones struck the Russian Tarantul-class corvette Ivanovets in the Black Sea, causing the ship to sink. Two weeks later on 14 February, the same type of Ukrainian sea drones struck and sank the Russian Landing ship Tsezar Kunikov. On 5 March, the patrol boat Sergei Kotov was also lost to sea drones.

==Structure==
Since 2012 the headquarters of the Russian Navy (Russian Navy Main Staff) is once again located in The Admiralty in Saint Petersburg. Russian naval manpower is a mixture of conscripts serving one-year terms and volunteers (Officers and Ratings). In 2006 the IISS assessed there were 142,000 personnel in the Russian Navy. This personnel number includes the Naval Infantry (Marines) and the Coastal Missile and Artillery Troops. As of 2008 the conscription term was reduced to one year and a major downsizing and reorganization were underway. In 2008, plans were announced to move the headquarters to the Admiralty building in St. Petersburg, the historic location of the headquarters of the Imperial Russian Navy. The Navy Staff finally relocated there in November 2012.

The Russian Navy is organised into four combat services - the Surface Forces, the Submarine Forces, the Naval Aviation and the Coastal Troops. Additionally the navy also includes support units afloat and ashore. It does not include special forces. The Naval Spetsnaz brigades are part of the Main Intelligence Directorate attached to the respective fleets and the Counter-Diversionary Forces and Assets (&quot;ПДСС&quot;) (which are units, protecting the Navy from incursions of enemy special forces) fall within the Coastal Forces.

During the Cold War the Soviet Armed Forces made the distinction between the various naval commands. The main fleets were the Northern and the Pacific Fleet. They were tasked with independent operations on the high seas and for that reason included strategic surface, submarine and air forces, including the country&#x27;s naval nuclear deterrent. Due to the limited geography of the Baltic and the Black Seas the respective Baltic and Black Sea Fleets were given a more circumscribed role in support of adjacent ground formation (the Main Command of the Troops of the Western Direction in Legnica (Poland) and the Main Command of the Troops of the South-Western Direction in Chișinău).

These two fleets were armed with shorter-range weapon systems than the main fleets (diesel-electric submarines, Sukhoi Su-24 fighter-bombers and a larger quantity of frigates and corvettes). Due to the closed nature of the Caspian Sea (still connected to the Baltic and Black Seas through the Volga River and the system of rivers and canals and navigable for ships of corvette size) its Caspian Flotilla had an even more limited role than the Fleets and played a defensive role supporting the Main Command of the Troops of the Southern Direction in Baku.

With the end of the Cold War a significant reduction in forces followed. Before the 2008 Russian military reform, the four fleets were ranked as equal in status to the six Military Districts. With the reform measures going into force the number of Military Districts was reduced and became new Joint Strategic Commands and the four fleets and one flotilla were subordinated to them with status equal to the Ground Forces and the Air Forces armies. Due to Russia&#x27;s increased interests in the Arctic region and the importance of Russia&#x27;s western/northwestern maritime defence the Northern Fleet, originally part of the Joint Strategic Command West (Western Military District), on 12 December 2014 became the basis for the newly formed fifth Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command.

=== Submarine and surface forces ===

The submarine and surface forces form the backbone of the Navy. The submarines form part of dedicated submarine squadrons and flotillas or part of squadrons and flotillas of mixed composition together with major surface combatants. The Russian Navy retains a rigid structure, whose levels of command could, according to military regulations, be directly equalled to the corresponding ground and air forces counterparts:
===Coastal troops===


Coastal Troops include the Naval Infantry and the Coastal Missile and Artillery Troops.

The Russian Naval Infantry are the amphibious force of the Russian Navy and can trace their origins back to 1705, when Peter the Great issued a decree for an infantry regiment &quot;of naval equipage&quot;. Since its formation it has seen action in the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, the Russo-Japanese War, the First and Second World Wars, and the Chechen and Georgian conflicts. Under the leadership of Admiral Gorshkov during the Cold War, the Soviet Navy expanded the reach of the Naval Infantry and deployed it worldwide on numerous occasions, but since the dissolution of the Soviet Union its role has been greatly reduced.

The Soviet Naval Infantry and their Russian successors have a reputation as elite shock troops. For their black uniforms and ferocious performance in combat in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea regions during World War II they received the nickname &quot;The Black Death&quot; (German: &quot;der schwarze Tod&quot;). The Russian Naval Infantry is a mechanised force, organised in brigades, independent regiments and independent battalions. The 55th Naval Infantry Division of the Pacific Fleet has been disbanded in 2009 and replaced by two separate brigades. Each brigade has a tank battalion, a self-propelled artillery battalion, a self-propelled air defence battalion, mechanised marine infantry battalions, other support units and one Airborne Assault Naval Infantry Battalion (&quot;десантно-штурмовой батальон морской пехоты&quot;), parachute and air assault qualified, with the mission to spearhead amphibious landings.

The coastal defence troops of the Russian Navy are conventional mechanised brigades with the main task to prevent enemy amphibious landings. An example of coastal defence troops are those of the Baltic Fleet. With Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania declaring independence at the end of the Soviet Union the Baltic Military District practically disintegrated. The massive ground forces formations left landlocked in the Kaliningrad Oblast were transferred from the ground forces to naval command and control. The integration of naval infantry and coastal defence troops is a relatively new tendency from the 2010s in order to simplify the naval command structure and the new Arctic infantry brigades in formation under the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command fall within that process.

The coastal artillery troops also play a very important role for the Navy. The geography of the Barents Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk as well as the Caspian Sea makes the deployment of shore-based, anti-ship systems in an area-denying role very effective. They deploy K-300P Bastion-P supersonic ASCM, 3M-54 Kalibr cruise subsonic ASCM and A-222E Bereg-E 130mm coastal mobile artillery system as well as self-propelled surface-to-air missile systems.

The Naval Infantry and Coastal Troops are led by the Deputy Commander for Naval Infantry/Commandant of the Naval Infantry of the Russian Navy, Lieutenant General (NI) Aleksandr Kolpatsenko. Their motto is: &quot;Where We Are, There is Victory!&quot;

===Naval aviation===
The first naval aviation units in Russia were formed from 1912 through 1914 as a part of the Baltic Fleet and the Black Sea Fleet. Since its formation, it has participated in the Russian Civil War, World War II and in many other conflicts throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia (&quot;statement requires source citation&quot;). During the Cold War the naval aviation pursued a policy of deploying large numbers of bombers in maritime strike roles to counter the U.S. Navy&#x27;s extensive fleet of aircraft carriers, by 1989 it operated over 1,000 fixed-wing aircraft with the majority being bombers such as the Tu-22M &quot;Backfire&quot; and the Tu-16 &quot;Badger&quot;.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union however, it has been significantly reduced in size. The Tu-22Ms have been transferred to the Aerospace Forces and since then the combat arm of the Naval Aviation is built around Sukhoi Su-33s, Mikoyan MiG-29Ks, with Sukhoi Su-30s and Sukhoi Su-34s replacing the obsolete Sukhoi Su-24s.

As of 2007, the Russian Naval Aviation consists of the following components:
* Naval missile-carrying aviation
* Shore-based ASW aviation
* Attack (&quot;Shturmovik&quot;) aviation
* Shore-based fighter aviation
* Reconnaissance aviation
* Shipborne aviation (fighters and ASW aircraft)
* Auxiliary air units

====Operational Command South - Tartus====

The Russian Navy maintains a base under the command of the Southern Military District in Syria at Tartus. The Mediterranean squadron was disestablished soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but a small naval logistics support facility remained there. In January 2017 Russia and Syria signed an agreement, to be valid for 49 years, to expand the Tartus facility with a view to improving the support at Tartus.

On 4 February 2022, naval detachments from the Northern Fleet and Baltic Fleet arrived at Tartus. Large amphibious assault ships &quot;Pyotr Morgunov&quot;, &quot;Georgy Pobedonosets&quot;, &quot;Olenegorsky Gornyak&quot;, &quot;Korolyov&quot;, &quot;Minsk&quot; and &quot;Kaliningrad&quot; were under the direction of Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Nikolay Yevmenov. In April 2022 there were around 20 Russian naval ships in the Mediterranean Sea. On 11 May it was reported that the flotilla had remained without change since early February. There were 13 ships and 5 support vessels of the four Russian fleets, including 9 attack missile ships. The formation of a &quot;Mediterranean Squadron&quot; of the Russian Navy in February 2022, using the Northern, Baltic, and Pacific Fleets&#x27; ships allowed the Russian Black Sea Fleet to return a large number of ships to the Black Sea some time prior to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. On 27 February three days after the commencement of the Russian invasion of Ukraine Turkey (who acts as guarantor of the Montreux Convention) decided to ban the passage through the straits of any warships whose homeport is not in the Black Sea.

====Caspian Flotilla====

===Eastern Military District – Eastern Joint Strategic Command===

====Pacific Fleet====
The Pacific Fleet, established on 10 May 1731, is headquartered in Vladivostok and based around Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. The Fleet consists of the following units:
*&quot;Slava&quot;-class cruiser (1)
*&quot;Sovremennyy-&quot;class destroyer (1 inactive since 2005; still reported in refit as of 2020)

*Kilo-class submarine (6-7)
*Improved Kilo-class submarine (4 plus one on sea trials; the fourth boat was deployed in the Baltic as of November 2022; fifth boat on sea trials - also in the Baltic - as of September 2023)

The Pacific Fleet also includes patrol ships, mine warfare ships, amphibious ships, and support vessels. There are also naval aviation and coastal troops and naval infantry components.

==Future and modernization==


Russia&#x27;s military budget expanded from 1998 until 2015, but economic problems including a sharp decline in oil prices led to budget cuts in 2016. Higher expenditure led to an increase in numbers of ships under construction, initially focusing on submarines, such as the conventional &quot;Petersburg&quot; (&quot;Lada&quot;)-class and nuclear &quot;Severodvinsk&quot; (&quot;Yasen&quot;)-class. Some older vessels have been refitted as well. &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; commented in 2004 that the construction programme was too focused on Cold War scenarios, given the submarine emphasis.

According to the Russian Defence Ministry, share of modern armament in the Navy has reached more than 50% in 2014. A report from December 2019 estimated the figure at 68%. However, in September 2020 it was reported that the defence budget was to be cut by 5% as part of a shift to social spending and in response the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting impact of such a cut on Russian Navy modernization plans was not immediately apparent. Likely more significant is the impact of sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation after 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In 2021, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev reportedly acknowledged that the Russian defence industry “is still dependent on foreign technologies.” The impact of international sanctions on naval procurement projects, given both reduced access to foreign technologies and significant pressure on the defence budget, had yet to be determined.

The &quot;Steregushchiy&quot;-class corvettes, the lead ship of which was laid down on 21 December 2001, is the first new surface construction since the collapse of the Soviet Union, while the new Admiral Sergei Gorshkov class frigates marks the first attempt of the Navy to return to the construction of large blue water capable vessels. The Russian Navy had been planning to procure a new class of destroyer, the general-purpose Project 21956. The Lider-class has been envisaged as a &quot;green water&quot; vessel and was anticipated to be nuclear-powered.

The project was reportedly suspended in 2020, apparently in favour of the less expensive Project 22350 Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates. The Gorshkov-class vessels have themselves experienced technical challenges and in 2020 it was initially suggested that the larger 22350M variant of that class would not be proceeding. However, it was later reported that design work on both the Lider and the 22350M variant of the Gorshkov-class was in fact moving forward.

In keeping with the emphasis on strategic forces, the Navy&#x27;s submarine fleet is being modernized by the acquisition of several classes of strategic and tactical submarines. Up to 12 Borei/Dolgorukiy-class SSBNs are planned to replace older classes in both the Northern and Pacific fleets. These are being complemented by new Yasen and Khabarovsk-class SSGNs, as well as conventional submarines of the Improved Kilo and Lada classes. However, in terms of the tactical nuclear submarine fleet, it is unclear whether the new Yasen-class, Khabarovsk-class, and potential follow-on models, can be produced in sufficient numbers, and on a timely basis, to replace aging older model nuclear submarines on a one-for-one basis. It has been reported that Russian third-generation nuclear submarines have not been modernized to a level to avoid block obsolescence before 2030.

On 28 April 2010, the Ukrainian parliament ratified an agreement to extend Russia&#x27;s lease of Crimean base facilities to 2042 with an option for five more years, through 2047. Following the invasion and subsequent annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, this agreement has been officially invalidated by the Russian State Duma. The Russian Navy has also revealed that the Russia&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet will receive 30 new ships by 2020 and will become self-sufficient with its own infrastructure in the Crimean peninsula. The fleet will be updated with new warships, submarines, and auxiliary vessels within the next six years. The new ships built for the Black Sea Fleet include three &quot;Admiral Grigorovich&quot;-class frigates (originally six, but two of the remaining three were sold to India and in 2021 it was reported that a third ship would also be sold abroad) and six Varshavyanka-class (Improved Kilo-class) diesel-electric submarines.

On 27 December 2015, state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation declared that by 2019 the company would have the technical ability to build aircraft and helicopter carriers, which came as some surprise to analysts as previously the company had stated carrier-building would not take place until 2025 at the earliest. Russia&#x27;s only existing carrier, the Soviet era &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; will remain in service at least until 2030.

In a May 2017, ten year defence review the development of a new aircraft carrier and nuclear powered destroyers was cancelled in favour of concentrating modernisation efforts on the nuclear triad. Development of a sixth generation SSBN was announced even though the fifth generation Borei class are still under construction as was a fleet of sub-frigate sized surface combatants.

On 14 July 2021, shipyard Sevmash announced that for the first time in decades several nuclear submarines of different projects are undergoing sea trials. In the summer 2021, three nuclear submarines were undergoing sea trials simultaneously: &quot;Borei II&quot; class &quot;Knyaz Oleg&quot;, &quot;Yasen-M&quot; class &quot;Novosibirsk&quot; and modernized &quot;Antey&quot; class &quot;Belgorod&quot;. The last time in Russia or Soviet Union nuclear submarines of three different classes were undergoing sea trials was 1993, when &quot;Improved Akula&quot; class &quot;Tigr&quot;, &quot;Antey&quot; class &quot;Omsk&quot; and &quot;Sierra II&quot; class &quot;Pskov&quot; were undergoing sea trials. The increased intensity of sea trials taking place indicates enhanced shipbuilding in Russian Navy.

On 12 January 2023, The Russian Northern Fleet announced in a press release that the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile-equipped Admiral Gorshkov Frigate successfully sailed through the English Channel to carry out its assigned duties in the Atlantic Ocean.

==Main Naval Parade in St. Petersburg==
Since 2017, by the decree of the President of Russia dated 27 July 2017, the tradition of holding the &quot;Main Naval Parade&quot; in St. Petersburg on the Navy Day has been restored. Prior to 2017, in Soviet and Russian Federation times the previously held annual St. Petersburg Navy Day parade was not so specifically named. The parade is composed of ships and sailors representing the several fleets and the Caspian Flotilla with small ships and submarines in the Neva River and the larger ones arrayed off Kronshtadt in the Gulf of St. Petersburg. It is celebrated annually on the last Sunday of July during the Navy Day holiday.

==Deployments from 2018==
===Ocean Shield===
In the years 2018–2021, the Russian Navy has been organizing central annual naval exercise called Ocean Shield.

Between 1–8 September 2018, Ocean Shield exercise was held for the first time. Unlike 2019 and 2020 exercises, conducted in the Baltic Sea, the first exercise took place in the Mediterranean Sea. 26 ships, 2 submarines and 34 aircraft were included. Among participants were cruiser &quot;Marshal Ustinov&quot;, destroyers &quot;Smetlivy&quot; and &quot;Severomorsk&quot;, frigates &quot;Admiral Grigorovich&quot;, &quot;Admiral Essen&quot;, &quot;Admiral Makarov&quot;, &quot;Pytlivy&quot; and &quot;Yaroslav Mudry&quot;, corvettes &quot;Vishny Volochyok&quot;, &quot;Grad Sviyazhsk&quot; and &quot;Veliky Ustyug&quot; and conventional submarines &quot;Kolpino&quot; and &quot;Velikiy Novgorod&quot;.

The aircraft present included Tu-160 bombers, Tu-142 and Il-38 anti-submarine aircraft and Su-33 and MiG-29K maritime fighters. This was the largest Russian naval exercise in the Mediterranean Sea of the post-Cold War era and the largest Russian post-Cold War naval exercise in the far sea zone. In terms of distant location and number of capital ships participating it&#x27;s comparable only to June 2021 exercises of the Pacific Fleet off the Hawaii islands.

Organized between 1–9 August 2019, the second Ocean Shield exercise was the exercise with the largest number of participating ships (69 ships, including 49 warships and 20 support ships) in the independent Russia and took place in the Baltic Sea. The 22 known ships of the exercise &quot;Ocean Shield 2019&quot; include cruiser &quot;Marshal Ustinov&quot;, destroyer &quot;Severomorsk&quot; and frigate &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot; of the Northern Fleet, as well as Baltic Fleet&#x27;s frigate &quot;Yaroslav Mudry&quot;, corvettes &quot;Steregushchy&quot;, &quot;Soobrazitelny&quot;, &quot;Stoykiy&quot;, &quot;Boikiy&quot;, &quot;Passat&quot;, &quot;Geyzer&quot;, &quot;Serpukhov&quot;, &quot;Mitishchi&quot;, &quot;Chuvashiya&quot;, &quot;Morshansk&quot;, &quot;Liven&quot;, &quot;Urengoy&quot;, R-257 and LSTs &quot;Aleksandr Shabalin&quot;, &quot;Kaliningrad&quot;, &quot;Minsk&quot; and &quot;Korolyov&quot;, as well as nuclear submarine &quot;Smolensk&quot;. Other possible participants include ships, participating in the July Naval Parade in St. Petersburg, i.e. frigate &quot;Admiral Kasatonov&quot;, corvettes &quot;Gremyashchy&quot; and &quot;Sovetsk&quot;, submarine &quot;Kronshtadt&quot; and minesweepers &quot;Ivan Antonov&quot;, &quot;Aleksandr Obukhov&quot; and &quot;Pavel Khenov&quot;.

On 3 August 2020, third Ocean Shield exercise started in the Baltic Sea and included Northern Fleet&#x27;s destroyer &quot;Vice-Admiral Kulakov&quot; and LST &quot;Pyotr Morgunov&quot; and Baltic Fleet&#x27;s corvettes &quot;Steregushchy&quot;, &quot;Boikiy&quot; and &quot;Stoikiy&quot;.

===Combined-fleet exercises===
====June 2021====
In 2021, no usual Ocean Shield exercise was conducted in August or September in the Baltic Sea. However, in June, the Pacific, Northern and Black Sea fleets conducted large-scale exercises. In mid June, four Russian cruisers and four destroyers were simultaneously at sea, or all operational large surface combatants except destroyer &quot;Severomorsk&quot;, which was probably the first time in the post-Cold war era. A complex large-scale exercise took place in the central Pacific Ocean, where the Russian Navy conducted possibly the strongest exercise of the post-Soviet era.

It took place prior to the 2021 Putin-Biden summit, similarly to Aport and Atrina exercises that were held in 1985 and 1987 prior to the Geneva and Washington summits of Gorbachev and Reagan to improve Soviet negotiation position. Officially, however, it was stated that the exercise is an answer to the exercise Agile Dagger 2021 of the US Pacific Fleet, employing one third of the operational submarines of the US Pacific Fleet.

In the Barents Sea, cruisers &quot;Marshal Ustinov&quot; and &quot;Pyotr Veliky&quot;, destroyer &quot;Vice-admiral Kulakov&quot; and submarines &quot;Kaluga&quot;, &quot;Gepard&quot; and &quot;Dmitry Donskoy&quot; were active. 
Between 7 and 24 June, a large-scale exercise was conducted by the Pacific Fleet in the central Pacific Ocean, being the first post-Cold war Russian naval exercise in that area (minor exceptions being destroyer &quot;Admiral Panteleev&quot; taking part in RIMPAC-2012 exercise and frigate &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot; sailing near Hawaii in 2019). It included cruiser &quot;Varyag&quot;, destroyers &quot;Marshal Shaposhnikov&quot; and &quot;Admiral Panteleyev&quot;, corvettes &quot;Sovershenny&quot;, &quot;Gromky&quot; and &quot;Aldar Tsydenzhapov&quot;, (a) nuclear submarine(s) (likely &quot;Omsk&quot; and &quot;Kuzbass&quot;) and intelligence ship &quot;Kareliya&quot;.

The exercise started in the central Pacific Ocean on 10 June, and on 21 June the ships 2500 nautical miles southeast of the Kuril islands simulated an attack on the enemy carrier strike group. Prior to that, the ships operated in two groups, sailing at 300 nautical miles from each other, one of them playing the role of enemy. The largest auxiliary ship of the Russian Navy &quot;Marshal Krylov&quot; also took part in the exercise and acted as a command ship for the commander of the exercise, rear admiral Konstantin Kabantsev, commander of Primorskaya Flotilla, as well as hospital ship &quot;Irtysh&quot; and MiG-31 interceptors and Il-38 and Tu-142 anti-submarine aircraft.

On 24 June, the final day of the exercise, three Tu-95 bombers, several Tu-22M bombers, escorted by interceptors MiG-31BM and two Il-78 tankers flew to the central Pacific Ocean as well. The Tu-95s delivered conditional strikes against enemy&#x27;s critical infrastructure and Tu-22M delivered strikes against enemy&#x27;s conditional carrier strike group together with &quot;Varyag&quot; and &quot;Marshal Shaposhnikov&quot;.

An additional destroyer &quot;Admiral Tributs&quot; was deployed to the South China Sea, accompanying nuclear submarine &quot;Nerpa&quot;.

On 18 June 2021, the Black Sea Fleet deployed cruiser &quot;Moskva&quot; to the Mediterranean Sea, which, amid deployment of &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; to the Eastern Mediterranean, took part in an unprecedented anti-ship exercise with bombers Tu-22M and interceptors MiG-31K both deployed to Syria for the first time in May and June. A MiG-31K reportedly fired a Kinzhal missile against a ground target in Syria, while a newest air defence system S-500 was reportedly tested at Khmeymim airbase and obtained a lock on F-35 fighter from &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. The exercise included rocket fire 30 km away from &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;.

====January–February 2022====
In January–February 2022 large-scale exercise of all Russian fleets took place with some 140 warships and support ships.

In the Northern Fleet it included two task groups. First, cruiser &quot;Marshal Ustinov&quot;, destroyer &quot;Vice-Admiral Kulakov&quot; and frigate &quot;Admiral Kasatonov&quot;, as well as tanker &quot;Vyazma&quot; and tug SB-406 were deployed to the southwest of Ireland, conducting first Russian post-Cold war naval exercise west of British isles. Second, destroyer &quot;Severomorsk&quot;, frigate &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot;, LST &quot;Ivan Gren&quot;, nuclear submarine &quot;Severodvinsk&quot;, diesel-electric submarine &quot;Kaluga&quot;, corvettes &quot;Snezhnogorsk&quot; and &quot;Brest&quot;, as well as support ships operated in the Barents Sea. Additionally, three LSTs were deploying to the Black Sea (&quot;Olenogorsky Gornyak&quot;, &quot;Georgiy Pobedonosets&quot; and &quot;Pyotr Morgunov&quot;).

In the Pacific Fleet, cruiser &quot;Varyag&quot;, destroyer &quot;Admiral Tributs&quot; and tanker &quot;Boris Butoma&quot; were deployed to the Indian Ocean, participating in the third Russo-Sino-Iranian naval exercise, first Russo-Chinese naval exercise away from Russian/Chinese coast that took place in the western Indian Ocean and will finally strengthen Mediterranean squadron. Additionally, submarine &quot;Volkhov&quot; fired a Kalibr missile in the Sea of Japan and two Tu-142 performed flight above the Okhotsk Sea.

In the Baltic Fleet, corvettes &quot;Soobrazitelny&quot; and &quot;Stoykiy&quot; were deployed to the Northern Sea, while &quot;Zeleny Dol&quot;, &quot;Mytishchi&quot;, &quot;Odintsovo&quot;, &quot;Aleksin&quot;, &quot;Kabardino-Balkariya&quot; were active in the Baltic Sea. Additionally, three LSTs were deploying to the Black Sea: &quot;Korolyov&quot;, &quot;Minsk&quot; and &quot;Kaliningrad&quot; and intelligence ship &quot;Vasily Tatishchev&quot; to the Mediterranean Sea, where it will monitor three-carrier exercise with CVN &quot;Harry Truman&quot;, &quot;Cavour&quot; and &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; in February 2022.

In the Black Sea Fleet, an exercise was conducted by frigates &quot;Admiral Essen&quot;, &quot;Ladnyy&quot;, corvettes &quot;Ingushetiya&quot;, &quot;Grayvoron&quot;, &quot;Naberezhnye Chelny&quot;, R-60, &quot;Yeysk&quot;, &quot;Suzdalets&quot; and other ships, totally around 20 ships.

===Annual exercise===
Russia organises a central military exercise for September each year.

During Zapad 2021, in Northern Fleet two surface groups were active: &quot;Admiral Ushakov&quot; and &quot;Admiral Kasatonov&quot; in the Barents Sea (along with coastal systems Bal and Bastion-P) and &quot;Severomorsk&quot; in the Arctic (along with LST &quot;Georgiy Pobedonosets&quot;, tug &quot;Pamir&quot; and tanker &quot;Sergey Osipov&quot;), as well as submarines &quot;Orel&quot; and &quot;Verkhoturye&quot; (along with minesweepers &quot;Yelnya&quot;, &quot;Soloyevetskiy&quot;, &quot;Yunga&quot;, &quot;Yadrin&quot; and &quot;Kotelnich&quot; in two groups). In the Baltic Fleet, frigate &quot;Yaroslav Mudry&quot;, corvettes &quot;Steregushchy&quot; and &quot;Stoykiy&quot; and submarine &quot;Dmitrov&quot; were active (along with coastal system Bal).

===Barents Sea===

On 22 February 2021, the Northern Fleet conducted an exercise in which cruiser &quot;Marshal Ustinov&quot; sailed in Varanger Fjord in the area of the Russia–Norway maritime border, becoming the first Russian warship to do so in the post-Cold War era. Sailing was speculated to be response to the US bombers (B-1B) landing in Norway on the same day for the first time.

Other ships active in the area in January–February 2021 included destroyer &quot;Severomorsk&quot;, frigate with the tug &quot;Altay&quot;, nuclear submarine &quot;Severodvinsk (&quot;that launched a Kalibr missile), corvettes &quot;Aysberg&quot;, &quot;Snezhnogorsk&quot;, &quot;Yunga&quot; and &quot;Brest,&quot; and salvage vessel &quot;Georgiy Titov&quot; with deep-submergence rescue vehicle &quot;AS-34&quot;.

===Atlantic===
South of Gibraltar, in September–October 2021 Russian Navy deployed destroyer &quot;Vice-Admiral Kulakov&quot; (along tanker &quot;Akademik Pashin&quot; and tug &quot;Altai&quot;) that visited Praia, Capo Verde and performed anti-piracy exercise in the Gulf of Guinea. It was the first deployment of a Russian warship south of Gibraltar since &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot;&#x27;s 2019 world circumnavigation.

===North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea===
In February 2008 a Russian Northern Fleet naval task force completed a two-month deployment in the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic which started on 4 December 2007. The operation was the first large-scale Russian Navy deployment to the Atlantic and the Mediterranean in 15 years. The task force included the &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;-class aircraft carrier &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;, the &quot;Udaloy&quot;-class destroyers and , and the &quot;Slava&quot;-class guided missile cruiser &quot;Moskva&quot;, as well as auxiliary vessels. During the operation the navy practiced rescue and counter-terror operations, reconnaissance, and missile and bomb strikes on the (theoretical) enemy&#x27;s naval task force. Over 40 Russian Air Force aircraft took part in joint exercises with the navy as well.

* In October 2008, a naval task group from the Northern Fleet, comprising the nuclear-powered missile cruiser &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot;, the large ASW ship &quot;Admiral Chabanenko&quot;, and support ships, left their homeport of Severomorsk in northern Russia on 22 September and sailed into the northern Atlantic, having covered a distance of in a week. Russian warships were scheduled to participate in joint naval exercises with the Venezuelan Navy in the Caribbean on 10–14 November, in line with the 2008 training program, and in order to expand military cooperation with foreign navies. These exercises actually took place on 1 December.
* 11 October 2008, Russian warships bound for Venezuela, including the nuclear-powered cruiser &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot;, put in at the Libyan port of Tripoli for resupply.
* From Venezuela &quot;Petr Velikiy&quot; proceeded alone to a port call in Cape Town, South Africa, then participated in the INDRA-2009 exercise off western India, briefly engaged in counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden, and returned to its homeport of Severomorsk in March 2009. The other ships in company returned to their home base in the Northern Fleet.
* A group of Pacific Fleet ships arrived in the Mediterranean Sea on 15 May 2013 having sailed from Vladivostok on 19 March 2013. , the &quot;Ropucha&quot;-class landing ships &quot;Peresvet&quot; and &quot;Admiral Nevelskoy&quot;, the tanker &quot;Pechenga&quot; and the rescue tug &quot;Fotiy Krylov&quot; augmented the Russian Navy&#x27;s grouping there, and carried out tasks in the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea. The Pacific Fleet ships practiced activities jointly with forces from other Russian navy fleets and made a number of business calls at ports in the region, including a call at Limassol, Cyprus on 17 May 2013.
* The Baltic Fleet &quot;Ropucha&quot;-class landing ships &quot;Kaliningrad&quot;, &quot;Aleksandr Shabalin&quot; and &quot;Azov&quot; arrived at Novorossiysk naval base on 14 May 2013 having completed their duties in the Mediterranean. The Baltic Fleet ships spent several weeks at Novorossiysk undergoing checks and maintenance and replenishing supplies before resuming their duties in the Mediterranean.
* The Northern Fleet&#x27;s &quot;Udaloy&quot;-class destroyer was reported to be heading for the Atlantic on 20 May 2013 after completing a visit to Norway. The ship had been taking part in the Russian-Norwegian Pomor-2013 exercise and is expected to take on supplies from the tanker &quot;Vyazma&quot; while at anchor in the North Sea before undertaking a lengthy voyage in the north eastern regions of the Atlantic Ocean.
* On 1 June 2013, Navy Commander Adm Viktor Chirkov said that the aircraft carrier &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; is &quot;expected to put out and perform a number of missions in an offshore oceanic zone as part of a group. Northern Fleet naval pilots will perform a number of missions on board this cruiser during the long-range mission.&quot; He also stated that the ship&#x27;s deployment might be as part of a permanent operational group in the Mediterranean. In preparing for the deployment the ships&#x27; airwing would not be using the NITKA pilot training facility located in Crimea, Ukraine.
* On 20 October 2016, a Northern Fleet task group headed by &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; was monitored by a fleet of least eight ships in the English Channel en route to Syria reportedly to participate in the attack on Aleppo. The British Royal Navy sent multiple ships including HMS &quot;Dragon&quot; to shadow each warship as the fleet met up with an additional two Russian warships. NATO also tasked its standing naval group SNMG1 to shadow the group and escort it through the Dover Straits towards the Mediterranean.
* On 17 February 2017, the Russian Navy surveillance vessel SSV-175 &quot;Viktor Leonov&quot; was cruising international waters off the East Coast of the United States. &quot;Viktor Leonov&quot; is outfitted with a variety of high-tech spying equipment designed to intercept signals intelligence. It first appeared off Delaware and, then moved south of the US submarine base at Groton, Connecticut collecting electronic signals.

===Syria===

* Sequentially having lost naval support facility access in Albania, Yugoslavia, and Egypt, in 1971 the Soviet Navy began operating from a leased facility in Tartus, Syria. 
* In September 2008, it was reported that Russia and Syria conducted talks about permitting Russia to develop and enlarge its naval base in Syria in order to establish a stronger naval presence in the Mediterranean, and amidst the deteriorating Russia relations with the west in conjunction with the 2008 South Ossetia war and the plans to deploy US missile defence shield in Poland, it has even been asserted that President Assad has agreed to Tartus port&#x27;s conversion into a permanent Middle East base for Russia&#x27;s nuclear-armed warships. Moscow and Damascus additionally announced that it would be renovating the port, although there was no mention in the Syrian press.
* On 22 September 2008, Russian Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said the nuclear-powered &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot; cruiser, accompanied by three other ships, sailed from the Northern Fleet&#x27;s base of Severomorsk. The ships will cover about to conduct joint maneuvers with the Venezuelan navy. Dygalo refused to comment on Monday&#x27;s report in the daily &quot;Izvestia &quot;claiming that the ships were to make a stopover in the Syrian port of Tartus on their way to Venezuela. Russian officials said the Soviet-era base there was being renovated to serve as a foothold for a permanent Russian navy presence in the Mediterranean.
* In late November 2011, Pravda and Reuters wrote that a naval flotilla led by the aircraft carrier &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; would sail to its naval base in Tartus as a show of support for the al-Assad regime. Such a visit is not possible because the lengths of all of Russia&#x27;s current modern warships exceed the size of the two 100 meter piers located at the Russian leasehold in Tartus. (see next paragraph)
* On 29 November 2011, Army General Nikolay Makarov, Chief of the Russian General Staff, said that sending ships of the Russian Navy to the Mediterranean Sea is linked to exercises and not to the situation in Syria. &quot;In the event of necessity, namely to carry out repairs, to take water and food on board and to allow rest for the crews, Russian ships may visit Tartus but in this case this has not been included in the plan of the trip,&quot; the Interfax source said. He also noted that the size of &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; does not allow it to moor in Tartus because the port does not have suitable infrastructure, i.e., large enough mooring.

===Sudan===
* On 23 July 2019, Russia and Sudan signed an agreement on establishment of a Russian naval base in Port Sudan in Khartoum and, on 1 December 2020, in Moscow. On 25 June 2021, Russian prime minister Mishustin submitted the agreement for ratification. On 12 July, Sudan was preparing for ratification too.
* Between 28 February and 2 May 2021, a number of Russian ships called at Port Sudan, beginning with frigate &quot;Admiral Grigorovich&quot; in what was the first visit of a Russian warship to Sudan in the modern history. This was followed by corvette &quot;Stoikiy&quot; and tug &quot;Kola&quot; on 19 March, signals intelligence ship &quot;Ivan Khurs&quot; on 10 April, signals intelligence ship &quot;Vasily Tatishchev&quot; and its accompanying repair ship PM-138 on 2 May.

===Algeria===
Russia and Algeria hold annual naval exercise at the end of the year.
* Between 16 and 17 November 2021, Russo-Algerian naval exercise was conducted. Russian Black Sea Fleet&#x27;s frigate &quot;Admiral Grigorovich&quot;, patrol ship &quot;Vasily Bykov&quot; and seagoing tug SB-742 took part, as well as Algerian frigate &quot;Harrad&quot;, training vessel &quot;La Sammam&quot; and rescue vessel &quot;El Munjid&quot;.

===Egypt===
Russia and Egypt have held an annual naval exercise at the end of the year since 2015. Usually, the exercise is conducted in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, an exception being 2020, when the exercise took place in the Black Sea. From 3–10 December 2021, another Russo-Egyptian naval exercise, Bridge of Friendship, took place in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The Russian task force comprised frigate &quot;Admiral Grigorovich&quot;, patrol ship &quot;Dmitry Rogachev&quot; and sea-going tug SB-742.

===Caribbean Sea===
On 8 September 2008, it was announced that the &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot; would sail to the Caribbean Sea in order to participate in naval exercises with the Venezuelan Navy. This represented the first major Russian show of force in that sea since the end of the Cold War. On 22 September the &quot;Kirov-&quot;class nuclear missile cruiser &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot; and the Udaloy class large anti-submarine ship &quot;Admiral Chabanenko&quot;, accompanied by support vessels, left their home port of Severomorsk for naval exercises with Venezuela scheduled for early November 2008. On 25 November 2008, a group of warships from Russia&#x27;s Northern Fleet arrived at the Venezuelan port of La Guaira.

=== East Africa: Somali Coast ===
* On 24 September 2008, the Russian frigate &quot;Neustrashimy&quot; left its home base at Baltiysk, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, for counter-piracy operations near the Somali coast.
* From 11 January to 17 March 2009, the &quot;Admiral Vinogradov&quot; took up the counter-piracy mission from the &quot;Neustrashimy&quot; and upon completion took a course home to Vladivostok by way of a port visit to Jakarta, Indonesia 24–28 March 2009.
* From 26 April to 7 June 2009, the Pacific Fleet destroyer &quot;Admiral Panteleyev&quot; took up counter-piracy duties in the Gulf of Aden, having left Vladivostok at the end of March 2009 to relieve the &quot;Admiral Vinogradov&quot;. It returned to Vladivostok on 1 July.

* On 11 January 2009, Army General Nikolai Makarov, Chief of the Russian General Staff, announced that the &quot;Kirov-&quot;class nuclear-powered cruiser &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot; and five other ships would take part in exercises with the Indian Navy in late January 2009.
* In 2021, Black Sea Fleet&#x27;s intelligence ship &quot;Kildin&quot; entered port Oman on 1 November. Besides, in summer, the newly built frigate &quot;Gremyashchy&quot; and Kilo (Varshavanka) class diesel-electric submarines &quot;Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky&quot; and &quot;Volkhov&quot; transited Indian Ocean on their way from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean.

===East Asia===
Since 2012, Russia and China have conducted an annual naval exercise. In even years, they take place off Chinese coast (usually in the Yellow Sea), and in odd years off Russian coast (usually in the Sea of Japan). In 2015 and 2017, in addition to the exercises in the Sea of Japan, additional exercises in the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea, respectively, were held. In 2021, for the first time the exercise surpassed the defensive character as Russian and Chinese warships passed through the Tsugaru Strait between Japanese islands Hokkaido and Honshu.

* On 23 October 2021, Russian and Chinese Navies conducted first ever joint patrol. Five warships of each navy participated, including two destroyers, two corvettes and a command ship. Russian Navy was represented by destroyers &quot;Admiral Panteleyev&quot; and &quot;Admiral Tributs&quot;, corvettes &quot;Gromky&quot; and &quot;Geroy Rossiyskoy federatsii Aldar Tsydenzhapov&quot; and tracking ship &quot;Marshal Krylov&quot;. The patrol group passed through the Tsugaru Strait. Joint Russo-Chinese operations imply readiness of both superpowers to cooperate to limit the power of the American-led order in the Asia-Pacific region.
* From 1–3 December 2021, the first naval exercise between Russia and ASEAN occurred in the Indonesian territorial waters. Russia was represented by destroyer &quot;Admiral Panteleyev&quot;, Vietnam by frigate &quot;Ly Thai To&quot;, Indonesia by frigate &quot;Raden Eddy Martadinata&quot;, Malaysia by frigate &quot;Lekiu&quot;, Singapore by corvette &quot;Vigour&quot;, Brunei by off-shore patrol vessel &quot;Daruttaqwa&quot;, Thailand by frigate &quot;Kraburi&quot; and Myanmar by frigate &quot;Kyansittha&quot;, while Philippines joined as an observer.
