<text>The 1995 Rugby League World Cup (also known as [[Halifax (United Kingdom bank)|Halifax]] Centenary World Cup for sponsorship reasons) was the eleventh World Cup for mens national rugby league teams. It was held between 7–28 October and hosted by England and Wales and was won by Australia who beat England at Wembley Stadium, their eighth World Cup win and fifth in succession.

Organised to celebrate the sports centenary, ten nations were invited to participate. The tournament had been preceded by doubts and pessimism; many feared that it would produce one-sided-matches that would be unattractive to supporters. The forthcoming Super League war also hung over the tournament, with the Australian Rugby League refusing to select players who had signed for the rival competition. Those fears proved unfounded, and the tournament was acclaimed a great success.

Although some early matches did prove as one-sided as feared, fans still flocked to see newer rugby league nations such as Fiji, Tonga, Western Samoa and South Africa. Large home crowds for the group involving Wales proved particularly encouraging for the sport.

For the 1995 tournament, a £10,000 cup was made by Tiffanys to celebrate the centenary of the game.

== Teams ==

Ten teams competed in the Centenary World Cup: Australia, England, Fiji, France, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Tonga, Wales and Western Samoa. It was the first time since the 1975 World Series that England and Wales competed, rather than Great Britain. Fiji, South Africa, Tonga and Western Samoa all made their World Cup débuts. Scotland and Ireland took part in the Emerging Nations Tournament that was held alongside the World Cup.

Australia was missing some of their best players, a number of whom had been part of the 1994 Kangaroos squad, due to the Super League war and the ARL&#x27;s refusal to select Super League-aligned players. Australia&#x27;s win in the end, with what many considered to be a second-string side, was seen as a blow to the Super League organisation, with which every other nation was aligned.

Canberra Raiders players Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Bradley Clyde, Steve Walters and Brett Mullins, won a court order against the ARL making Super League players eligible for representative games. Despite assurances from the ARL that all players were considered, only ARL loyal players were selected for the Kangaroos World Cup squad.

== Venues ==
The games were played at various venues in England and Wales.

Wembley Stadium in London was the host stadium for the opening ceremony and match featuring hosts England and defending champions Australia. Wembley, England&#x27;s national stadium, would also host the Final of the tournament.

=== Semi-finals ===

England as expected defeated reigning European Champions Wales in their semi-final at Old Trafford. The other Semi at Huddersfield almost produced a boil over. After defeating New Zealand 3–0 in the Trans-Tasman Test series earlier in the year, and with the Kiwis lackluster form in their Group B games, Australia was expected to easily account for Frank Endacott&#x27;s side, but the Kiwis found form and the game ended 20–all at the end of 80 minutes (following a missed sideline conversion attempt by the Kiwis Matthew Ridge and a missed left foot drop goal attempt by the same player - both in the last few minutes of regular time). However, 20 minutes of extra time saw Australia skip away to a 30–20 win to book their place in the Final at Wembley.

=== Final ===
The Australians had reached the final after a hard-fought 30–20 Semi-final win over New Zealand at the McAlpine Stadium which had gone into extra time after the score was locked at 20-all after 80 minutes. Their opponents and tournament host England, had an easier time defeating Wales 25–10 in their semi at Old Trafford. Even though they were favoured to win, Australia went into the final having lost three of their past four games at Wembley (the only win being the World Cup final of 1992), and had already lost the opening match of the tournament there to the English. Also, due to the ARL&#x27;s policy of not selecting Super League aligned players, the Kangaroos went into the game with 11 of their 17 players under the age of 24. Although considered mostly a &#x27;second string&#x27; team without the likes of Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Andrew Ettingshausen, Steve Renouf, Steve Walters and Glenn Lazarus, most of the Kangaroos had played in the 3–0 whitewash of New Zealand in the Trans-Tasman series earlier in the year. Kangaroos captain and five-eighth Brad Fittler and fullback Tim Brasher were the only members of Australia&#x27;s 1992 World Cup final win over Great Britain at Wembley, with both players in the same positions as they had been three years previously.

England&#x27;s captain Shaun Edwards ruled himself out of the final with an infected knee. Despite almost being ruled out of the tournament with pneumonia, St Helens centre Paul Newlove was selected by coach Phil Larder for starting line-up in the final. Larder also handed the captaincy to veteran test forward Denis Betts. With the former Wigan back rower now playing for the Auckland Warriors in the Australian premiership, his selection as captain created history as he became the first player to captain England while not currently playing in the British competition.

After winning in 1992, Australian coach Bob Fulton became just the second coach (after Harry Bath) to win two Rugby League World Cups. It was Fulton&#x27;s 5th World Cup win after also winning in 1968, 1970 and 1975 as a player. Coincidentally, Fulton&#x27;s coach in the 1968 and 1970 World Cup finals was Harry Bath.

First half

England won the coin toss and Australia&#x27;s Andrew Johns kicked off the match. In England&#x27;s first set with the ball Australia were penalised for their skipper Brad Fittler&#x27;s high tackle on Andrew Farrell. From the resulting good field position England were able to force a line drop-out and get another set of six in Australia&#x27;s half of the field. At the end of the set, Radlinski put up a high kick, which Australia&#x27;s fullback Tim Brasher failed to secure and Australia were penalised for regathering the ball when off-side. Bobbie Goulding kicked the penalty goal from fifteen metres out, giving his side a 2–0 lead. From Australia&#x27;s resulting kick-off, the English players couldn&#x27;t secure the ball and it was regathered by the Kangaroos deep in the opposition half. On the last tackle of the ensuing set, Johns at first receiver put a chip kick into the left-hand corner of England&#x27;s in-goal area where winger Rod Wishart dived in and got a hand on it, giving Australia the first try of the match in the seventh minute. Johns then converted the try from the touch-line and the Kangaroos were leading 6–2. A few minutes later England were penalised around the centre of the field and Johns attempted the kick at goal but missed. With the game now swinging from end to end, Johns conceded a penalty close to the goal posts and Goulding&#x27;s kick bounced off the uprights but went in, so England were trailing 6–4 by the eighteenth minute. A few minutes later England conceded a penalty in front of their goal posts and Johns kicked Australia to an 8–4 lead. Shortly after that England winger Martin Offiah made a break down along the left sideline and was contentiously ruled to have been taken over the sideline by a desperate Tim Brasher tackle as he threw the ball back into the field for Paul Newlove to toe ahead and dive on, though television replays suggested that Offiah had managed to release the ball before he went into touch. After a high shot from Andy Farrell on Mark Carroll, Johns kicked another penalty giving Australia a 10–4 lead at the 30-minute mark. Just before the half-time break England conceded another penalty in the ruck but Johns&#x27; kick missed so the score remained unchanged at the break.

Second half

After making their way into good attacking field position, England played the ball ten metres out from Australia&#x27;s goal-line where centre Paul Newlove at dummy-half ran the ball at the defence forced his way through to score in the left corner. The sideline conversion attempt by Goulding missed so England trailed 10–8 after five minutes of the second half. Around the ten-minute mark the game was interrupted by a topless female streaker. The play continued swinging from one end of the field to the other, with neither team able to capitalise on their scoring opportunities for the next twenty minutes. Australian interchange player Jason Smith was blood binned and had to return to the bench. A few minutes later the Kangaroos had made their way deep into England&#x27;s half when, on the last tackle, the ball was moved through the hands and eventually flicked passed back from Johns as he was being tackled to the feet of Brasher who kicked it ahead to the try-line. Both fullbacks then scrambled to get to the ball and the referee ruled that Brasher had grounded it, awarding Australia a try. Johns converted the try so Australia lead 16–8 with just over 10 minutes remaining. England forward Karl Harrison then had to come off the field with an injured arm. A few minutes from full-time Australian forward Mark Carroll was sent to the sin-bin for an infringement in the ruck. The remainder of the match extended into additional injury time but was played with no further points so Australia retained the World Cup with a 16–8 victory and their fifth consecutive world title.

21-year-old Andrew Johns was named man-of-the-match. Kangaroos coach Bob Fulton had named the young half as the team hooker, and he did indeed pack into the scrums. However Johns played at halfback in general play with Geoff Toovey having the dummy-half duties, necessary because Toovey had actually injured his neck during the tournament and simply could not pack into the front row in the scrums.

Following the match Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex presented Kangaroos captain Brad Fittler with the Cup and each of the players with medals. During the 1990 Kangaroo Tour, an 18-year-old Fittler had reportedly broken protocol when he had said &quot;G&#x27;day dude&quot; to Prince Edward&#x27;s father, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh when the team had met the Duke as part of the tour. History allegedly repeated itself as Fittler was heard to say &quot;Thanks dude&quot; to Prince Edward when receiving the World Cup on the Wembley balcony.

<text>Linn Records is a Glasgow-based record label which specialises in classical music, jazz and Scottish music. It is part of Linn Products.

==History==
While Linn engineers were testing their flagship product, the Sondek LP12 turntable, they became frustrated with some of the specialist test LPs they were using. Work began on an LP cutting lathe as a research product to improve testing for the LP12.

The first album to be cut and subsequently released was &quot;A Walk Across the Rooftops&quot; by The Blue Nile. They also released Carol Kidd&#x27;s debut album.

Linn Records is an audiophile label, specialising in classical, jazz and Celtic music, and won the Record Label of the Year award at the 2010 Gramophone Awards. Release formats include CD, SACD, HDCD, vinyl and digital downloads.

Between 1995 and 2011 Linn artwork was designed by John Haxby. Since September 2013, all artwork has been designed by GM Toucari.

==High resolution downloads==
As of February 2013 all &#x27;Studio Master&#x27; downloads from linnrecords.com are available in FLAC format, ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec.) and MP3. 

In 2008, Linn Records started to host music for other labels and now offers a library of more than 700 Studio Master Quality albums from 96 different labels. The start of 2012 saw the label form a partnership with Universal to sell a range of their back catalogue.

<text>The genus Passerina is a group of birds in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae). Although not closely related to the buntings in the family Emberizidae, they are sometimes known as the North American buntings.

The males show vivid colors in the breeding season; the plumage of females and immature birds is duller. These birds go through two molts in a year; the males are generally less colorful in winter. They have short tails and short slim legs. They have smaller bills than other Cardinalidae; they mainly eat seeds in winter and insects in summer.

The blue grosbeak (&quot;P. caerulea&quot;) was once placed in the monotypic genus, &quot;Guiraca&quot;.

==Taxonomy and list of species==
The genus &quot;Passerina&quot; was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The type species was designated in 1840 as the indigo bunting (&quot;Passerina cyanea&quot;) by the English zoologist George Robert Gray. The genus name is from the Latin &quot;passerinus&quot; meaning &quot;sparrow-like&quot;.

The genus contains 7 species:

<doc id="377506" wikidata="Q1078965" url="?curid=377506" title="Gadulka">
<text>The gadulka () is a traditional Bulgarian bowed string instrument. Alternate spellings are &quot;gǎdulka&quot;, &quot;gudulka&quot; and &quot;g&#x27;dulka&quot;. Its name comes from a root meaning &quot;to make noise, hum or buzz&quot;. The gadulka is an integral part of Bulgarian traditional instrumental ensembles, commonly played in the context of dance music.

The gadulka commonly has three (occasionally four or five Mincho Minchev) main strings with up to sixteen sympathetic resonating strings underneath introduced by the legendary Mincho Nedyalkov. Only the main melodic strings are touched by the player&#x27;s fingers and the strings are never pressed all the way down to touch the neck. The gadulka is held vertically, with the bow held perpendicular in an under-hand hold.

There is a smaller variant of the instrument in the Dobrudja region with no sympathetic strings at all.

Gadulka&#x27;s possible origin may be the [[Byzantine lyra|lira]], the bowed Byzantine instrument of the 9th century AD and ancestor of most Western European bowed instruments. Similar bowed instruments and lira descendants have continued to be played in the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe until the present day, for example the similar in construction Gusle from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania; also the lyra of Crete and the Dodecanese, Greece; the Lira Calabrese of Calabria; Italy and the Classical kemence in Istanbul, Turkey.

==Construction==
The body and neck of the instrument are carved out of one piece of wood, the body forming a bowl or gourd like a lute. The top (soundboard), of straight-grained softwood is also carved, with a shallower arch. The overall construction is quite heavy compared to, say, a violin, though some gadulkas are exquisitely built. (The instrument generally lacks any real decoration or ornamentation, apart from the design of the peghead.) The bridge, placed between the two roughly D-shaped soundholes, has one foot placed on the top, while the other foot rests on top of the soundpost which contacts the inside of the back. The vibration of the strings is thus directly transferred to both the top and back of the instrument. 
Unlike many other stringed instruments, there is no nut at the top of the strings: the strings are simply stretched between a tuning peg at the top and the tailpiece at the bottom, passing over the bridge (the playing strings) or through holes in the bridge (the sympathetics). The tailpiece is typically made out of bone, and secured to the carved projecting &quot;endpin&quot; by stout steel wire. The endpin also serves to hold the bottom of the instrument to a strap or belt worn by the player. 
Gadulka strings are steel, either plain in the smaller gauges or wound with steel or bronze in the larger ones; they are basically guitar strings. The strings are secured to the tailpiece by their ball ends.

==Tuning==

While various tunings are (and have been) used, the standard tuning for the gadulka is A-E-A for the three playing strings; the sympathetics (resonating strings) are tuned chromatically to cover all notes besides A and E (depending on the number of sympathetics).

===Regional variations of Galdulka tuning===
*Thrace: 
:1st string – A1, 2nd string –E1, 3rd string – A

*Dobrudja: 
:1st string – A1, 2nd string – A, 3rd string – E1

*Lingourie: 
:1st string – A1, 2nd string – E1, 3rd string – D1

*Another variant:
:A, E, D

*SELIGRA-MINCHEV 5strings
1st string-G2,
2nd string-C2,
3rd string-G1,
4 string-D1,
5 string-GM,

<text>Qualitonis a frequently used record-label name in different countries. There have been and there still are several labels known as Qualiton, in particular the Hungarian state-owned corporation during the post-World War II years in Europe. The company changed its name to Hungaroton in the mid-1960s, but the Qualiton label remained for gypsy music and operetta repertoire. Other records labels bought the Qualiton license from Hungaroton and eventually became their own labels. Discos Qualiton and Qualiton South Wales are examples of the latter.

== Qualiton, South Wales ==

Qualiton Records was a small record label which produced shellac and vinyl records in the 1950s until at least 1963 at Pontardawe, in the Swansea Valley in South Wales. It was subsequently purchased by Decca and renamed Qualiton Records (1968) Ltd, and the losses associated with the company used by Decca for tax reasons.

== Discos Qualiton, Argentina ==
Discos Qualiton was an independent record label own by Fonema S.A. in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

<text>The 2000 Rugby League World Cup was the twelfth World Cup for men’s national rugby league teams, held between 28 October and 25 November and hosted between the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. Australia won their ninth title by beating New Zealand 40-12 in the final at Old Trafford.

Following the success of the previous tournament, the World Cup was expanded to 16 teams and for the first time featured qualification rounds before the finals.

Alongside the men&#x27;s tournament, it was also the same year when the inaugural Women&#x27;s Rugby League World Cup was first played.

==Summary==
Following the success of the 1995 Rugby League World Cup, organisers decided to expand the 2000 tournament to 16 teams, 15 were invited while seven emerging nations were invited into a qualifying tournament to determine the 16th place.

The millennium World Cup attracted a record sponsorship of over £1 million from title Lincoln Financial Group, who had also sponsored Great Britain&#x27;s Tests against New Zealand the previous year. The tournament also made a £2 million profit, despite attracting small crowds. 

Despite its financial success the 2000 World Cup was seen as a failure, with too many blow out score lines and the inclusion of New Zealand Māori team being invited alongside the New Zealand National team. Despite being the only team to have to qualify to play in the World Cup, Lebanon were criticised for consisting entirely of Australians of Lebanese origin, which led to derisory comments in the media. The tournament also attracted criticism of its lack of marketing and poor crowds.

France performed creditably and had healthy attendances in games they hosted, while the much-derided Lebanon team also proved the catalyst for domestic competition in that country.

==Qualifying==
Six countries – , the , , , and – competed for one available place in the tournament. Lebanon defeated the United States 62–8 in the final play-off match.

==Teams==

The 2000 World Cup tournament featured 16 teams:

== Venues ==
The games were played at various venues in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, France.

<text>The fingerboard (also known as a fretboard on fretted instruments) is an important component of most stringed instruments. It is a thin, long strip of material, usually wood, that is laminated to the front of the neck of an instrument. The strings run over the fingerboard, between the nut and bridge. To play the instrument, a musician presses strings down to the fingerboard to change the vibrating length, changing the pitch. This is called &quot;stopping&quot; the strings. Depending on the instrument and the style of music, the musician may pluck, strum or bow one or more strings with the hand that is not fretting the notes. On some instruments, notes can be sounded by the fretting hand alone, such as with hammer ons, an electric guitar technique.

The word &quot;fingerboard&quot; in other languages sometimes occurs in musical directions. In particular, the direction &quot;sul tasto&quot; (Ital., also &quot;sulla tastiera&quot;, Fr. &quot;sur la touche&quot;, G. &quot;am Griffbrett&quot;) for bowed string instruments to play with the bow above the fingerboard. This reduces the prominence of upper harmonics, giving a more ethereal tone.

== Frets ==
A fingerboard may be fretted, having raised strips of hard material perpendicular to the strings, which the player presses the strings against to stop the strings. On modern guitars, frets are typically made of metal. Frets let the player stop the string consistently in the same place, which enables the musician to play notes with the correct intonation. As well, frets do not dampen string vibrations as much as fingers alone on an unfretted fingerboard. Frets may be fixed, as on a guitar or mandolin, or movable, as on a lute. Fingerboards may also be unfretted, as they usually are on bowed instruments, where damping by the finger is of little consequence because of the sustained stimulation of the strings by the bow. Unfretted fingerboards allow a musician more control over subtle changes in pitch than fretted boards, but are generally considered harder to master. Fingerboards may also be, though uncommon, a hybrid of these two. Such a construction is seen on the sitar, where arched frets attach at the edges of a smooth fingerboard; unfrettable strings run inside the frets, while frettable ones run outside. The fret arches are sufficiently high that the exterior strings can be fretted without the finger making contact with the interior strings.

Frets may be marked by inlays to make navigating the fingerboard easier. On six-string guitars and bass guitars, markers are typically single smallish dots on the fingerboard and on its side that indicate the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th frets—and the octaves of those positions higher up the neck. A double dot or some other variation marks the 12th fret and 24th frets. Variations on the standard dot shape can make a guitar more distinctive. Position markers are sometimes made luminescent (through using paint, or illuminated with light emitting diodes) to make them more visible on stage. Position markers are also sometimes repeated on the edge of the fingerboard for easy viewing.

Over time, strings wear frets down, which can cause buzzing and deaden the sound. Fixing this occasionally requires replacing the frets—but more often they just need &quot;dressing&quot;. In fret dressing, a luthier levels and polishes the frets, and crowns (carefully rounds and shapes) the ends and edges. Stainless steel guitar frets may never need dressing, because of the density of the material. Not having frets carefully and properly aligned with the fingerboard can cause severe intonation issues and constant detuning. The ultimate way of determining the source of a buzz and detuning problem is to measure the levelness of the frets. A straightedge positioned on the neck in the &quot;lie&quot; of one of the strings should show nearly level frets. (There should be a slight &quot;relief&quot; to compensate for the elliptical shape of the vibrating strings.)

== Materials ==
On bowed string instruments, (such as violin, viola, cello, and double bass), the fingerboard is usually made of ebony, rosewood or other hardwood. On some guitars, a maple neck and fingerboard are made from one piece of wood. A few modern luthiers have used lightweight, non-wood materials such as carbon-fiber in their fingerboards.
Various impregnated wood materials are being used for fingerboards in fretted instruments.

== Parameters ==
Typically, the fingerboard is a long plank with a rectangular profile. On a guitar, mandolin, ukulele, or similar plucked instrument, the fingerboard appears flat and wide but may be slightly curved to form a cylindrical or conical surface of relatively large radius compared to the fingerboard width. The &quot;radius&quot; quoted in the specification of a string instrument is the radius of curvature of the fingerboard at the head nut.

Most bowed string instruments use a visibly curved fingerboard, nut and bridge to provide bow clearance for each individual string.

The length, width, thickness and density of a fingerboard can affect timbre. Most fingerboards can be fully described by these parameters:

* &quot;w1&quot; — width at nut (close to the headstock)
* &quot;w2&quot; — width at half of scale length (if fretted, usually the 12th fret)
* &quot;h1&quot; — profile height (thickness) at the nut
* &quot;h2&quot; — profile height (thickness) at half of scale length
* &quot;r&quot; — radius (may be non-constant)

=== Radius ===

Depending on values of radius &quot;r&quot; and their transition over the length of the fingerboard, all fingerboards usually fit into one of the following four categories:

Notes:
* formula_1 is a scale.
* formula_2 designates a place on fingerboard, changes from 0 (at nut) to formula_1 (at bridge).
* formula_4 describes radius depending on place on fingerboard.
* formula_5 is a non-linear function.

Classical guitars, some 12-string guitars, banjos, dobros, pedal steel, and a few steel-stringed acoustic guitars have flat fingerboards. Almost all other guitars have at least some curvature. However, some recent five and six string electric basses have flat fingerboards.

For guitars, some players feel that smaller radii (7.25–10&quot;) are more comfortable for chord and rhythm playing, while larger radii (12&quot;-16&quot; and up to flat) are better for fast soloing. Conical and compound radius fingerboards try to merge both these features. The nut end of the fingerboard has a smaller radius to ease in forming chords. The bridge end of the fingerboard has a larger radius to make soloing more comfortable and prevent &quot;noting out&quot; (&quot;fretting out&quot;), in which a string comes in contact with a higher fret during bends.

&quot;A Brief History Of Discovering The Conical Fingerboard&quot; in 1978 by luthier Denny Rauen can be found in American Lutherie #8/Winter 1986 and String Instrument Craftsman May/June 1988 under the title &quot;Multi-Radius Fingerboards&quot;. 
This special radiusing is a standard on many of Denny&#x27;s custom-built guitars and refret work beginning in 1978. Denny Rauen&#x27;s articles on the &quot;Multi Radius Fingerboard&quot; are the first published documents on using a conical fingerboard to improve string bending while retaining comfortable chording.

Bowed string instruments usually have curved fingerboards, to allow the player to bow single strings. Those of the modern violin family and the double bass are strongly curved, however those of some archaic bowed instruments are flat.

== Scalloping ==
A fretted fingerboard can be scalloped by &quot;scooping out&quot; the wood between each of the frets to create a shallow &quot;U&quot; shape. The result is a playing surface wherein the players&#x27; fingers come into contact with the strings only, and do not touch the fingerboard.

The process of &quot;scalloping&quot; a fingerboard well, if done by hand, is tedious work, usually done by careful filing of wood between the frets, and requires a large investment of time. Consequently, it is relatively expensive to have done. Generally, luthiers scallop fingerboards with a special milling machine that has 22 or 24 (according to neck dimensions and number of frets) wood cutting tools. This equipment saves time and adds precision to the process of scalloping the wood in the neck&#x27;s radius the same in all fret spaces.

Scalloped fingerboards are most commonly used by shred guitarists, most notably Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen, who have signature models developed with Fender that include scalloped fingerboards. Ibanez JEM series guitars, designed and played by Steve Vai, come standard with the last 4 frets scalloped. In 2008 Ibanez made available their E-Gen model, a Herman Li signature, which includes four scalloped frets (21st to 24th). Karl Sanders of the death metal band Nile also uses several guitars with scalloped fingerboards, including several Deans, and KxK Guitars.

In the 1970s, English guitarist John McLaughlin played with Shakti, along with Indian violinist L. Shankar, using an acoustic guitar with a fully scalloped fretboard. He also used an electric guitar with a scalloped fretboard in studio and live performances from 1978 to 1979. McLaughlin explained that this feature increased the ease and range of string bends by eliminating friction between the finger and fretboard. The scalloped fretboard also facilitates the rapid, microtonal variation that is important in Indian music, as exemplified by classical Indian Sitar music. Without scallops, the guitarist must play microtones by sliding the string sideways on the fret.

Experimental luthier Yuri Landman made an electric guitar for John Schmersal of Enon called the Twister with a partial scalloped neck for only the thin strings (similar to small playground slides).

Some examples of lutes with scalloped fretboards include the South Indian veena and Vietnamized guitar (called &quot;đàn ghi-ta&quot;, &quot;lục huyền cầm&quot;, or &quot;ghi-ta phím lõm&quot;). The Japanese multi-instrumentalist and experimental musical instrument builder Yuichi Onoue has also made a deeply scalloped electric guitar for Vietnamese microtonal playing techniques.

Some types of scalloping are:

* Partial Scalloping, with some of the high frets scalloped for fast soloing. Popular examples include half scalloping (12th to the last fret, used by Kiko Loureiro of Megadeth, among others) or upper fret scalloping (19–24, 17–22, etc.), used by such guitarists as Steve Vai. When done by hand, sometimes fretboards can be scalloped half below the D or G strings, as in the case for Turkish luthier Kenan Turgut.
* Full Scalloping, i.e., all frets from the first to the last are scalloped
* Extreme Scalloping scalloping has lateral intrusions in addition to the standard vertical hollows. The additional versatility in note control comes at the cost of substantially reduced rigidity of the neck.

Note that filing away wood to scallop a fingerboard also affects inlays—so intricately inlaid fingerboards are not usually good candidates for scalloping. Simple dot or block inlays survive the procedure moderately well.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
The &quot;scooped out&quot; nature of scalloped fingerboards creates a number of changes in the way the guitar plays. Most obvious is that the fingertip only contacts the string, not the fingerboard itself, creating less friction for bends and vibratos, which results in more overall control while playing. It also results in more weight-relief and less &quot;neck-dive&quot;.

However, one of the main disadvantages is that many players, especially new players, may find a scalloped fingerboard too different, and difficult to play easily, especially if the strings are of a lighter gauge or the player tends to press too hard. It takes practice to play in tune on a scalloped fingerboard. The player must first become accustomed to not actually touching the fingerboard. Playing a scalloped fingerboard requires a careful application of pressure: Too much pressure raises the pitch of the fretted note to a sharp note, as during a bend, and too little pressure causes fret buzz. As a result, most guitar players use a traditional fingerboard on their instruments.

== Scoop of fretless bowed-string fingerboards ==
Fretless bowed-string fingerboards are usually scooped lengthwise in a smooth curve, so that if a straight edge is held next to the board parallel to a string, some daylight shows between them, towards the centre of the board. Usually the scoop is slightly greater on the bass side, less on the treble side of the fingerboard. Different string materials or different styles of playing may call for differing amounts of scoop. Nylon or gut strings require the most, and solid steel-core strings the least. A typical full-size (4/4) violin with synthetic-core G, D, and A strings shows 0.75 mm of scoop under the G string, and between 0.5 mm and zero scoop under the E, which is usually a solid steel core on modern instruments.

== Dip of guitar fretboards ==
On guitars, specifically steel-string and electric guitars, the relief (or &quot;dip&quot;) is adjustable by altering the tension on the steel truss rod inside the neck. Relaxing the truss rod allows the pull of the strings to increase the dip, and vice versa. Classical guitars do not need truss rods due to the lower tension of nylon strings but should still exhibit some degree of dip.

<text>The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is one of eight extant species of porpoise. It is one of the smallest species of cetacean. As its name implies, it stays close to coastal areas or river estuaries, and as such, is the most familiar porpoise to whale watchers. This porpoise often ventures up rivers, and has been seen hundreds of kilometres from the sea. The harbour porpoise may be polytypic, with geographically distinct populations representing distinct races: &quot;P. p. phocoena&quot; in the North Atlantic and West Africa, &quot;P. p. relicta&quot; in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, an unnamed population in the northwestern Pacific and &quot;P. p. vomerina&quot; in the northeastern Pacific.

==Taxonomy==
The English word porpoise comes from the French (Old French , 12th century), which is from Medieval Latin , which is a compound of &quot;porcus&quot; (pig) and (fish). The old word is probably a loan-translation of a Germanic word, compare Danish &quot;marsvin&quot; and Middle Dutch &quot;mereswijn&quot; (sea swine). Classical Latin had a similar name, &quot;porculus marinus&quot;. The species&#x27; taxonomic name, &quot;Phocoena phocoena&quot;, is the Latinized form of the Greek φώκαινα, &quot;phōkaina&quot;, &quot;big seal&quot;, as described by Aristotle; this from φώκη, &quot;phōkē&quot;, &quot;seal&quot;.

The species is sometimes known as the common porpoise in texts originating in the United Kingdom. In parts of Atlantic Canada it is known colloquially as the puffing pig, and in Norway ‘nise’, derived from an Old Norse word for sneeze; both of which refer to the sound made when porpoises surface to breathe.

==Description==

The harbour porpoise is a little smaller than the other porpoises, at about long at birth, weighing . Adults of both sexes grow to . The females are heavier, with a maximum weight of around compared with the males&#x27; . The body is robust, and the animal is at its maximum girth just in front of its triangular dorsal fin. The beak is poorly demarcated. The flippers, dorsal fin, tail fin and back are a dark grey. The sides are a slightly speckled, lighter grey. The underside is much whiter, though there are usually grey stripes running along the throat from the underside of the body.

Many anomalously white coloured individuals have been confirmed, mostly in the North Atlantic, but also notably around Turkish and British coasts, and in the Wadden Sea, Bay of Fundy and around the coast of Cornwall.

Although conjoined twins are rarely seen in wild mammals, the first known case of a two-headed harbour porpoise was documented in May 2017 when Dutch fishermen in the North Sea caught them by chance. A study published by the online journal of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam points out that conjoined twins in whales and dolphins are extremely rare.

The vocalizations of the harbour porpoise is made up of short clicks from 0.5 to 5 milliseconds in bursts up to two seconds long. Each click has a frequency between 1000 and 2200 hertz. Aside from communication, the clicks are used for echolocation.

==Distribution==
The harbour porpoise species is widespread in cooler coastal waters of the North Atlantic, North Pacific and the Black Sea. In the Atlantic, harbour porpoises may be present in a curved band of water running from the coast of West Africa to the coasts of Portugal, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Scandinavia, Iceland, Greenland, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and the eastern seaboard of the United States. The population in the Baltic Sea is limited in winter due to sea freezing, and is most common in the southwest parts of the sea. There is another band in the Pacific Ocean running from the Sea of Japan, Vladivostok, the Bering Strait, Alaska, British Columbia, and California.

The populations in these regions are not continuous and are classified as separate subspecies with &quot;P. p. phocoena&quot; in the North Atlantic and West Africa, &quot;P. p. relicta&quot; in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, an unnamed population in the northwest Pacific and &quot;P. p. vomerina&quot; in the northeast Pacific. 

Concerning the North Atlantic, an international workshop co-organised by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission and the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research reviewed the status of the species in 2018. It concluded that the harbour porpoise population structure is more complex than previously thought, with at least three genetically distinct subspecies in the North Atlantic. Given the structure of the harbour porpoise population, the workshop delineated 18 assessment areas for the North Atlantic.

==Population status==
The harbour porpoise has a global population of at least 700,000. In 2016, a comprehensive survey of the Atlantic region in Europe, from Gibraltar to Vestfjorden in Norway, found that the population was about 467,000 harbour porpoises, making it the most abundant cetacean in the region, together with the common dolphin. Based on surveys in 1994, 2005 and 2016, the harbour porpoise population in this region is stable. The highest densities are in the southwestern North Sea and oceans of mainland Denmark; the latter region alone is home to about 107,000-300,000 harbour porpoises. The entire North Sea population is about 335,000. In the Western Atlantic it is estimated that there are about 33,000 harbour porpoises along the mid-southwestern coast of Greenland (where increasing temperatures have aided them), 75,000 between the Gulf of Maine and Gulf of St. Lawrence, and 27,000 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The Pacific population off mainland United States is about 73,000 and off Alaska 89,000. After sharp declines in the 20th century, populations have rebounded in the inland waters of Washington state. In contrast, some subpopulations are seriously threatened. For example, there are less than 12,000 in the Black Sea, and only about 500 remaining in the Baltic Sea proper, representing a sharp decrease since the mid-1900s.

==Natural history==
===Ecology===
Harbour porpoises prefer temperate and subarctic waters. They inhabit fjords, bays, estuaries and harbours, hence their name. They feed mostly on small pelagic schooling fish, particularly herring, pollack, hake, sardine, cod, capelin, and sprat. They will, however, eat squid and crustaceans in certain places. This species tends to feed close to the sea bottom, at least for waters less than deep. However, when hunting sprat, porpoise may stay closer to the surface. When in deeper waters, porpoises may forage for mid-water fish, such as pearlsides. A study published in 2016 showed that porpoises off the coast of Denmark were hunting 200 fish per hour during the day and up to 550 per hour at night, catching 90% of the fish they targeted. Almost all the fish they ate were very small, between long.

A study (2024) shown that prey availability is an important driver of seasonal and diel dynamics of harbour porpoise acoustic activity in the Black Sea. In the southeastern region, porpoise activity was primarily nocturnal, with a peak from January to May, aligned with anchovy migration. On the northwestern shelf, porpoises were more active during daylight from April to October, reflecting the migration patterns of sprat.

Harbour porpoises tend to be solitary foragers, but they do sometimes hunt in packs and herd fish together. Young porpoises need to consume about 7% to 8% of their body weight each day to survive, which is approximately 15 pounds or 7 kilograms of fish. Significant predators of harbour porpoises include white sharks and killer whales (orcas). Researchers at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland have also discovered that the local bottlenose dolphins attack and kill harbour porpoises without eating them due to competition for a decreasing food supply. An alternative explanation is that the adult dolphins exhibit infanticidal behaviour and mistake the porpoises for juvenile dolphins which they are believed to kill. Grey seals are also known to attack harbour porpoises by biting off chunks of fat as a high energy source.

===Behaviour, reproduction and life-span===
Some studies suggest porpoises are relatively sedentary and usually do not leave a certain area for long. Nevertheless, they have been recorded to move from onshore to offshore waters along coast. Dives of by harbour porpoises have been recorded. Dives can last five minutes but typically last one minute. A rarely occurring parabolic dive type has been hypothesized to represent a state of unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, during which the porpoise engages in largely automated swimming behavior and very little vocalization. These episodes make up only a small proportion of all dives, but the animal may also engage in periods of sleep during other undemanding manoeuvers, such as slow surfacing from depth.

The social life of harbour porpoises is not well understood. They are generally seen as a solitary species. Most of the time, porpoises are either alone or in groups of no more than five animals. Porpoises mate promiscuously. Males produce large amounts of sperm, perhaps for sperm competition. Females become sexually mature by their third or fourth year and can calve each year for several consecutive years, being pregnant and lactating at the same time. The gestation of the porpoise is typically 10–11 months. Most births occur in late spring and summer. Calves are weaned after 8–12 months. Their average life-span in the wild is 8–13 years, although exceptionally individuals have reached up to 20, and in captivity up to 28 years. In a study of 239 dead harbour porpoises in the Gulf of Maine–Bay of Fundy, the vast majority were less than 12 years old and the oldest was 17.

==Threats==
===Hunting===
Harbour porpoises were traditionally hunted for food, as well as for their blubber, which was used for lighting fuel. Among others, hunting occurred in the Black Sea, off Normandy, in the Bay of Biscay, off Flanders, in the Little Belt strait, off Iceland, western Norway, in Puget Sound, Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The drive hunt in the Little Belt strait is the best documented example. Thousands of porpoises were caught there until the end of the 19th century (it was banned in 1899), and again in smaller scale during the shortages that occurred in World War I and World War II. A similar, short-lived re-emergence of hunting during the world wars happened in Poland and the Baltic countries. Currently, the species is only hunted as part of the traditional Inuit hunt in the Arctic, notably in Greenland. In prehistoric times, harbour porpoises were also hunted in many areas, for example by the Alby People of the east coast of Öland, Sweden. 

===Interactions with fisheries===
The main threat to porpoises is static fishing techniques such as gill and tangle nets. Bycatch in bottom-set gill nets is considered the main anthropogenic mortality factor for harbour porpoises worldwide. Several thousand die each year in incidental bycatch, which has been reported from the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, off California, and along the east coast of the United States and Canada. Bottom-set gill nets are anchored to the sea floor and are up to in length. It is unknown why porpoises become entangled in gill nets, since several studies indicate they are able to detect these nets using their echolocation. Porpoise-scaring devices, so-called pingers, have been developed to keep porpoises out of nets and numerous studies have demonstrated they are very effective at reducing entanglement. However, concern has been raised over the noise pollution created by the pingers and whether their efficiency will diminish over time due to porpoises habituating to the sounds.

Mortality resulting from trawling bycatch seems to be less of an issue, probably because porpoises are not inclined to feed inside trawls, as dolphins are known to do.

===Overfishing===
Overfishing may reduce preferred prey availability for porpoises. Overfishing resulting in the collapse of herring in the North Sea caused porpoises to hunt for other prey species. Reduction of prey may result from climate change, overfishing, or both.

===Noise pollution===
Noise from ship traffic and oil platforms is thought to affect the distribution of toothed whales, like the harbour porpoise, that use echolocation for communication and prey detection. Noise from shipping traffic, particularly busy sea lanes, appears to instigate evasive behavior, with predominantly lateral movements during the day and deeper dives during the night. The construction of thousands of offshore wind turbines, planned in different areas of North Sea, is known to cause displacement of porpoises from the construction site, particularly if steel monopile foundations are installed by percussive piling, where reactions can occur at distances of more than . Noise levels from operating wind turbines are low and unlikely to affect porpoises, even at close range.

===Pollution===
Marine top predators like porpoises and seals accumulate pollutants such as heavy metals, PCBs and pesticides in their fat tissue. Porpoises have a coastal distribution that potentially brings them close to sources of pollution. Porpoises may not experience any toxic effects until they draw on their fat reserves, such as in periods of food shortage, migration or reproduction.

===Climate change===
An increase in the temperature of the sea water is likely to affect the distribution of porpoises and their prey, but has not been shown to occur. Reduced stocks of sand eel along the east coast of Scotland, a pattern linked to climate change, appears to be the main reason for the increase in malnutrition in porpoises in the area.

==Conservation status==
Overall, the harbour porpoise is not considered threatened and the total population is in the hundreds of thousands.

The harbour porpoise populations of the North Sea, Baltic Sea, western North Atlantic, Black Sea and North West Africa are protected under Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In 2013, the two Baltic Sea subpopulations were listed as vulnerable and critically endangered respectively by HELCOM. Although the species overall is considered to be of Least Concern by the IUCN, they consider the Baltic Sea and Western African populations critically endangered, and the subspecies &quot;P. p. relicta&quot; of the Black Sea endangered.

In addition, the harbour porpoise is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU).

<text>The Shenyang J-6 (: 歼-6; designated F-6 for export versions; NATO reporting name: Farmer) is the Chinese-built version of the Soviet MiG-19 &#x27;Farmer&#x27; fighter aircraft, the world&#x27;s first mass-produced supersonic aircraft.

==Design and development==

Although the MiG-19 had a comparatively short life in Soviet service, the Chinese came to value its agility, turning performance, and powerful cannon armament, and produced it for their own use between 1958 and 1981. While the basic Soviet-built MiG-19 has been retired from all nations, the Shenyang J-6 still flies for nine of its original 15 operators, however, in a very limited capacity. The J-6 airframe contributed to the Chinese ground attack version, the Q-5, which still flies for numerous nations.

The J-6 was considered &quot;disposable&quot; and was intended to be operated for only 100 flight hours (or approximately 100 sorties) before being overhauled. The Pakistan Air Force was often able to extend this to 130 hours with diligent maintenance.

A number of J-6 based at Lianchen and Yantan-li bases appeared to have been converted into unmanned aircraft. Work on unmanned J-6 was first reported in 2013.

===Description===

The J-6 has a maximum speed at altitude of 1,540 km/h (960 mph), Mach 1.45. Service ceiling is 17,900 m (58,700 ft). Combat radius with two drop tanks is about 640 km (400 mi). The aircraft is powered by two Liming Wopen-6A (Tumansky R-9) turbojet engines. In addition to the internal cannon armament, most have provision for four wing pylons for up to 250 kg (550 lb) each, with a maximum ordnance load of 500 kg (1,100 lb). Typical stores include unguided bombs, 55 mm rocket pods, or PL-2/PL-5 (Chinese versions of Soviet K-13) air-to-air missiles.

==Operational history==

===Albania===
Albanian Air Force J-6s replaced the J-5s on the border to intercept Yugoslav incursions into Albanian airspace. However, the J-6 was ineffective against the faster Yugoslav MiG-21 &#x27;Fishbed&#x27;. Once the F-7A became available, the J-6 was redeployed to protect Tirana. As of 2005 all Albanian fighters were grounded due to a lack of spare parts.

=== Pakistan ===
Between 1965 and 1980, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) received 260 F-6 fighters which went on to serve with 10 PAF squadrons at various times. During their service, Pakistani F-6s also underwent 140 modifications at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex to improve its capabilities in the interceptor and close air support roles. These modifications included installation of Martin-Baker ejection seats, gun cameras, western avionics, AIM-9B/J/P missiles, French 68mm SNEB rockets, underbelly gondola-style fuel tanks and a special ground power unit, to quickly start the engines and shorten scramble time.

==== 1971 Indo-Pakistani War ====
When the 1971 War broke out, the PAF had operationalized three F-6 squadrons which were the No. 11, No. 23 &amp; No. 25 Squadrons. The F-6s of these squadrons collectively flew 945 sorties out of which 834 were combat ones.

=====Air to Air Combat=====
Throughout the war, the F-6 flew 650 Air Defence sorties in which they shot down approximately 8 Indian warplanes while damaging 2 more.

On 4 December 1971, Flight Lieutenant Javaid Latif of the No. 23 Squadron shot down an Su-7 over Risalewala Airfield while Flying Officer Qazi Javed of the No. 25 Squadron shot down a Hawker Hunter over Mianwali Airfield.

On 5 December 1971, Wing Commander Saad Hatmi (the Officer Commanding of the No. 25 Squadron) and his wingman Flight Lt. Shahid Raza shot down 2 Indian Hunters near Sakesar.

On 7 December 1971, Flight Lt. Atiq Sufi of the No. 11 Squadron shot down an Su-7 near Samba.

On 8 December 1971, Wing Commander Hashmi shot down a Su-7 which was attacking the Risalewala Airfield.

On 14 December 1971, Flight Lieutenant Amir Sharif of No. 11 Squadron claimed to have shot down a superior IAF MiG-21 over Shakargarh.

=====Ground Attack=====
Moreover, the F-6 flew 184 Ground Attack sorties where their 3 x 30 mm guns and 57 mm S-5 rockets were particularly effective against Indian armour, military vehicles, bunkers, and troop concentrations. Their Close Air Support missions at Shakargarh were the most successful.

At the end of the war, the PAF had lost two F-6s to ground fire while losing one F-6 to an Indian Su-7. An F-6 was also lost to friendly fire.

Some notable Pakistani F-6 pilots are Mushaf Ali Mir who later became the PAF&#x27;s Chief, Wajid Ali Khan who was taken as a POW after being shot down by Indian AAA, he later became a Member of the Parliament in Canada and Syed Manzoor ul Hassan Hashmi. The single-seat F-6 was retired from the Pakistan Air Force in 2002 and replaced with the Chengdu F-7P/PG aircraft.

===Vietnam War===
The supersonic speed advantage provided by the MiG-21&#x27;s more modern turbojet engine was found to be not as useful in combat as originally thought, because aerial dogfights at the time were conducted almost entirely at subsonic speeds. The J-6 (and hence the MiG-19 too) was found to be more manoeuvrable than the MiG-21 and, although slower, its acceleration during dogfights was considered adequate. The North Vietnamese Air Force fielded at least one unit of J-6s during the war, the 925th Fighter Regiment, beginning in 1969.

===Somalia===
Somalia ordered at least eleven F-6Cs and two FT-6s in 1979. Deliveries started in 1980. They were used during border skirmishes with Ethiopia in 1981, and they also saw combat during the Somali Rebellion, in the second half of the 1980s and until 1991.

===Sudan===
Twelve F-6 fighters and two FT-6 trainers were reportedly delivered to the Sudanese Air Force, starting in 1973. Moreover, twelve F-6Cs were delivered between 1981 and 1983. Another batch of twelve F-6Cs might have been acquired in 1990, as well as two FT-6s in 2001. Sudanese F-6s participated in the Second Sudanese Civil War, from the 1980s to the early 1990s. One F-6 was claimed shot down by the rebels in 1988, and two more in the autumn of 1991.

===Uganda-Tanzania War===
The Tanzania Air Force Command received its first batch of twelve F-6s starting in June 1973. An additional twelve F-6Cs and up to four FT-6s were also delivered in 1982. Tanzanian F-6s participated in the 1978–1979 Uganda-Tanzania War. However, they aren&#x27;t known to have been involved in any air-to-air combats.

===Zambia===
Twelve F-6s were delivered to the Zambian Air Force, probably between 1976 and 1978. On 8 June 1980, Zambian F-6s intercepted and shot down an Angolan Yakovlev Yak-40, under unknown circumstances.

===Kampuchea-Vietnam War===

In the era of Khmer Rouge control of Cambodia (1975–1979), Chinese-supplied Khmer J-6s participated in Kampuchea-Vietnamese border clashes for ground attacks. During the Vietnamese invasion in 1978, the Cambodian aircraft were reluctant to take-off to intercept the Vietnamese ones, thus the Vietnamese captured a number of J-6s and put them on public display.

===Iran–Iraq War===
During the 1980–88 Iran–Iraq War, both sides deployed J-6 fighter jets. Documents from the US Defense Intelligence Agency released under the Freedom of Information Act (United States) on Chinese arms sales to Iran reveal that between 1980 and 1987 China delivered 100 J-6 fighter jets to Iran. Iraq&#x27;s J-6 fighters were transferred from the Egyptian Air Force. Most missions J-6s performed during the Iran-Iraq War were air-to-ground attack.

==Variants==
===Mass production type===

* Shenyang J-6 – (a.k.a. Type 59, Dongfeng-102, Product 47 and F-6) Despite having no suffix to the designation, the J-6 appeared after the initial production of the J-6A had begun. The J-6 was equivalent, but not identical, to the MiG-19S.
* Shenyang J-6A – Production of the J-6 restarted after new assembly jigs, and other assistance, acquired from the USSR. Similar to MiG-19PF, an all-weather radar-equipped interceptor with two NR-30 30mm cannon. Exported as the F-6A.
* J-6B – (a.k.a. Type 59B, Dongfeng-105 and Jianjiji-6 Yi) Similar to MiG-19PM &quot;Farmer-D&quot;, interceptor with two PL-1 (Chinese version of Soviet K-5 (AA-1 &#x27;Alkali&#x27;) beam-riding air-to-air missiles; it is unclear if the J-6B retains its cannon. Only 19 J-6Bs were built by Nanchang Aircraft Mfg. Co. before the programme was terminated.
* J-6C – (a.k.a. Jianjiji-6 Bing, Product 55 and F-6C) Day fighter version with three 30mm cannons and braking parachute at the base of the rudder. This cannon&#x27;s codename is Type 30-1.
* Shenyang J-6D – Advanced version of the J-6A with radome on the splitter plate (rather than the shock cone centerbody) for a Chinese-made radar. May also have been designated J-6 Xin. Another name is &quot;J-6III&quot;. The name D-type was coined as a piggyback.
* Shenyang/Tianjin JJ-6 – (&quot;Jianjiji Jiaolianji&quot; – fighter trainer, a.k.a. Product 48 and FT-6) Chinese designed two-seat trainer, stretched 84 cm (33.1 in) to accommodate second seat, armed with one 30 mm cannon.
* Shenyang JZ-6 – (Jianjiji Zhenchaji – reconnaissance fighter) Dedicated reconnaissance version with fuselage camera pack replacing cannon. In April 2006, it was reported that the PLAAF 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment, 26 Air Division based in Nanjing MR, is was last regiment to actively fly the JZ-6 refusing to convert to the JZ-8F. Exported as the Shenyang FR-6.
* Guizhou J-6A – J-6A aircraft upgraded to carry two PL-2 (&quot;Pi Li&quot; – Thunderbolt) infrared-homing air-to-air missiles. The first flight was on 21 December 1975.
* J-6W - target drone variant, first reported in 2013.

===Prototype machine (including unfinished)===
* Shenyang J-6A – (a.k.a. Type 59A, Dongfeng-103, Jianjiji-6 Jia) – Early production from 1958 to 1960 was sub-standard and not accepted by the PLAAF. Production was halted, the jigs scrapped, and production restarted with assistance from the USSR. The J-6A was equivalent to the MiG-19P. The maiden flight was made by Wang Shuhuai on 17 December 1958. Only around 100 aircraft from this version were produced. It was reported that the J-6A never actually passed the PLAAF&#x27;s tests. The planes were of little operational value and suffered from quality issues, flight characteristics were much lower than those of the J-6.
* Shenyang J-6I – Single-seat day-fighter prototype with fixed shock cone on the intake splitter plate.
* Shenyang J-6II – Single-seat tactical fighter prototype with adjustable shock cone on a raked back intake splitter plate.
* Shenyang/Tianjin JJ-6 Testbed – Ejection seat testbed that succeeded H-5 ejection seat testbed.
* Xian BW-1 – Fly-by-wire flying controls test-bed for the Xian JH-7 flying control system.

<doc id="377537" wikidata="Q1575637" url="?curid=377537" title="Hankel matrix">
<text>In linear algebra, a Hankel matrix (or [[catalecticant]] matrix), named after Hermann Hankel, is a rectangular matrix in which each ascending skew-diagonal from left to right is constant. For example,

formula_1

More generally, a Hankel matrix is any formula_2 matrix formula_3 of the form

formula_4

In terms of the components, if the formula_5 element of formula_3 is denoted with formula_7, and assuming formula_8, then we have formula_9 for all formula_10

==Properties==
* Any Hankel matrix is symmetric.
* Let formula_11 be the formula_2 exchange matrix. If formula_13 is an formula_14 Hankel matrix, then formula_15 where formula_16 is an formula_14 Toeplitz matrix. 
** If formula_16 is real symmetric, then formula_15 will have the same eigenvalues as formula_16 up to sign.
* The Hilbert matrix is an example of a Hankel matrix.
* The determinant of a Hankel matrix is called a catalecticant.

==Hankel operator==
Given a formal Laurent series
formula_21
the corresponding Hankel operator is defined as
formula_22
This takes a polynomial formula_23 and sends it to the product formula_24, but discards all powers of formula_25 with a non-negative exponent, so as to give an element in formula_26, the formal power series with strictly negative exponents. The map formula_27 is in a natural way formula_28-linear, and its matrix with respect to the elements formula_29 and formula_30 is the Hankel matrix 
formula_31
Any Hankel matrix arises in this way. A theorem due to Kronecker says that the rank of this matrix is finite precisely if formula_32 is a rational function, that is, a fraction of two polynomials
formula_33

==Approximations==
We are often interested in approximations of the Hankel operators, possibly by low-order operators. In order to approximate the output of the operator, we can use the spectral norm (operator 2-norm) to measure the error of our approximation. This suggests singular value decomposition as a possible technique to approximate the action of the operator.

Note that the matrix formula_3 does not have to be finite. If it is infinite, traditional methods of computing individual singular vectors will not work directly. We also require that the approximation is a Hankel matrix, which can be shown with AAK theory.

==Hankel matrix transform==
The Hankel matrix transform, or simply Hankel transform, of a sequence formula_35 is the sequence of the determinants of the Hankel matrices formed from formula_35. Given an integer formula_37, define the corresponding formula_38-dimensional Hankel matrix formula_39 as having the matrix elements formula_40 Then the sequence formula_41 given by 
formula_42
is the Hankel transform of the sequence formula_43 The Hankel transform is invariant under the binomial transform of a sequence. That is, if one writes
formula_44
as the binomial transform of the sequence formula_45, then one has formula_46

== Applications of Hankel matrices ==
Hankel matrices are formed when, given a sequence of output data, a realization of an underlying state-space or hidden Markov model is desired. The singular value decomposition of the Hankel matrix provides a means of computing the &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; matrices which define the state-space realization. The Hankel matrix formed from the signal has been found useful for decomposition of non-stationary signals and time-frequency representation.

=== Method of moments for polynomial distributions ===
The method of moments applied to polynomial distributions results in a Hankel matrix that needs to be inverted in order to obtain the weight parameters of the polynomial distribution approximation.

=== Positive Hankel matrices and the Hamburger moment problems ===

<text>The &quot;Chicken Dance&quot;, also known and recorded as Der Ententanz, Tchip Tchip, Vogerltanz, the Bird Song, the Chicken Song, the Birdie Song, the Bird Dance, Danse des Canards, the Duck Dance, El Baile de los Pajaritos, O Baile dos Passarinhos, Il Ballo del Qua Qua, Check Out the Chicken, or Dance Little Bird, is an oom-pah song; its associated fad dance has become familiar throughout the Western world. The song was composed by accordion player Werner Thomas from Davos, Switzerland, in the 1950s.

The Chicken Dance is a well-known drinking and dancing song at American Oktoberfest events. It is also a popular dance at weddings, particularly in whose culture includes polka music. Over 140 versions have been recorded worldwide, including some that were released by Walt Disney Records, together making an estimated 40,000,000 records or more pressed.

The original name of the song was &quot;Der Ententanz&quot; (The Duck Dance), composed by the Swiss accordionist Werner Thomas in 1957. He played it in restaurants and hotels from the 1950s through the 1960s.

During one of Thomas&#x27; performances, the Belgian music producer Louis van Rymenant heard the song. Van Rymenant had some lyrics created and in 1970 released it to the public through his publishing company Intervox Music (later co-publishing with his other company Eurovox Music) without much success. It first became a world-wide hit from 1980 through 1982, and was recorded in many countries.

On some recorded releases of the music Werner Thomas is listed as the sole composer, while on others other composers are listed, e.g., as &quot;Thomas/Rendall/Hoes.&quot; The name Rendall refers to Van Rymenant, who was listed as co-author under the pen name of Terry Rendall. The name Hoes refers to the Dutch singer/producer Johnny Hoes, who re-arranged the song for the Electronicas recording (which was released on Hoes&#x27; own record label, Telstar Records).

Eurovox Music now manages the publishing rights worldwide, except for the US (September Music), UK (Valentine Music) and the Netherlands (Benelux Music), sub-publishers.

==Description of the dance==

The origin of the dance moves set to the music is not known.

The piece is often notated in cut time and the key of C major. It begins with repeated dominant chords before moving into the main theme. The secondary theme features a contrasting rhythm. The two themes alternate. In some versions tempo shifts are introduced to confuse and amuse the dancers, and the final repetition of the main theme is often played as one continuous accelerando.

The dance step has five discrete moves. The first four moves are done in place and are repeated throughout each verse:
# The dancer lifts both hands into the air and opens and closes them as if operating a hand puppet (simulating a chicken&#x27;s vocalizations) four times, once on each beat;
# The dancer tucks their hands into their armpits and flaps them like a chicken four times, once on each beat;
# The dancer wiggles their shoulders and/or hips (tail feathers) while descending downward for two beats;
# The dancer claps four times.

The fifth move persists throughout the refrain and involves the dancer and a partner.

# The pair may lock arms, facing opposite directions, and spin. They may switch arms and directions (and sometimes partners) halfway through the refrain. 
# The pair may &quot;swing out,&quot; by holding hands, leaning back, and rotating in place, first clockwise and then counterclockwise. 
# If performed in a circle dance or square dance formation, the entire group of participants may simply rotate the circle in one direction, then shift direction halfway through the refrain, or they may perform an allemande at the command of a caller.

The performance of one or more dancers in bird costumes leading a crowd in the dance is quite common. A 1981 video recording of the Tweets performing the song before a live television audience in the UK shows all of the &quot;musicians&quot; in large, mascot-style bird costumes, miming to the recording, while a group of British teens perform the dance in a line behind them. Since then, many state fairs, Oktoberfests, German culture festivals, and even weddings feature at least one dancer in a bird costume. The live performances by Bob Kames throughout the upper Midwest during the 1980s and 1990s almost always featured bird-costumed dance leaders.

== Notable recordings and title changes ==
* In 1981, Henry Hadaway produced a version of the song, which was released in the United Kingdom as an instrumental novelty tune &quot;The Birdie Song&quot; by The Tweets. It peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart in October 1981, making it the most popular version. A 1981 video shows bird-costumed dancers miming as instrumentalists while the recording plays and young people dance on stage. This may be the earliest recording of the dance and hand-clapping. In 2000, this version was voted &quot;the most annoying song of all time&quot; in a poll commissioned for the Web site dotmusic.
* In 1981, the Spanish accordionist María Jesus Grados Ventura, better known as María Jesús y su Acordeón, released the song as &quot;El Baile de los Pajaritos.&quot; This version included Spanish lyrics in both the verses and refrain.
* In 1981, the song was recorded and released in Finland by Frederik under the name &quot;Tralalala&quot;
* In 1981 the Italian musicians Al Bano and Romina Power recorded it as &quot;Il ballo del Qua Qua.&quot;
* In 1981 a French recording by René Simard and Nathalie Simard was released under the title &quot;La Danse des Canards.&quot;
* In 1982, the music producer for the Milwaukee-based organist and polka composer Bob Kames first heard &quot;Dance Little Bird&quot; at a German music fair. The producer sent Kames a copy, and Kames recorded his own version on the Hammond organ, as &quot;Dance Little Bird&quot; or &quot;The Chicken Dance&quot; and released it that same year. The Kames recording hit solid gold when it was released in 1983 in Poland, selling 300,000 copies. Kames received 2 of the 35 cents from each sale. Since he could not take the money out of the country, he donated all of it to for a relief fund. The success of the song stunned Kames. He commented in a 1995 interview, &quot;This stupid little thing, it&#x27;s infectious. It has only two chords, it doesn&#x27;t even change for the bridge. It implants the melody in people&#x27;s minds—it just sticks in there. That&#x27;s gotta be the secret ... It just keeps on going. People come up to me at jobs and tell me how happy it makes them. You get a song like this once in a lifetime.&quot; Kames became known as &quot;The Chicken Dance King&quot; and performed the song live at hundreds of festivals with fellow musicians like Lawrence Welk and Frankie Yankovic, as well as his own children, Bob Jr. and Barbara Kames.
* In 1982, the polka-themed cover band &quot;The Emeralds&quot;, from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, released their version on K-Tel records. The album that included it, &quot;Bird Dance,&quot; was advertised heavily on television, and the ad featured a bird-costumed dancer among a group performing the dance. The album went double-platinum in Canada, and gold in Australia. The song also contributed to the success of multiple gold albums for the Emeralds in 1983 and 1984.
* In 1990 an electronic remix was released by the Belgian band Brussels Sound Revolution as &quot;La Danse Des Canards / De Vogeltjesdans&quot;.
* In 1990, the Dutch band Grandmaster Chicken and DJ Duck released the song as &quot;Check Out the Chicken&quot;, which peaked at number 16 in Australia.

== Notable live performances ==

* In 1981, the song and its dance were performed during the Tulsa, Oklahoma Oktoberfest. A local television station provided a chicken costume for the use of a dancer at the festival, in keeping with the costumed performances by The Tweets in England, and this costume is said to have been what gave the &quot;Chicken Dance&quot; its American name.
* On 13 November 2009, CIHT-FM played the Chicken Dance continuously until 389 tickets for the CHEO Dream of a Lifetime were purchased at CA$100 each, to support the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario. This played for over 3 hours.
* On 23 April 2010, in a fund raiser for Helen DeVos Children&#x27;s Hospital, an attempt at the world&#x27;s largest chicken dance record was held at Byron Center, Michigan at Jake&#x27;s restaurant, the site of a giant plastic chicken sculpture.
* During the 2015–16 season, NHL club Philadelphia Flyers had the chicken dance played over the PA system at the Wells Fargo Center every time the Flyers scored four goals in that game. The Flyers had a partnership with Chick-Fil-A where customers could get free breakfast sandwiches from Chick-Fil-A the day after every game where the Flyers scored four goals or more.
* During Sanremo 2024, conductors Amadeus and Fiorello had the Chicken Dance played and performed with actor John Travolta.
==Dance Like a Chicken Day==
May 14th is recognized as &quot;Dance Like a Chicken Day.&quot; This is celebrated as a day to do the dance.

<text>The Chengdu J-7 (: 歼-7; third generation export version F-7; NATO reporting name: Fishcan) is a Chinese fighter aircraft. It is a license-built version of the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, and thus shares many similarities with that aircraft. The aircraft is armed with short-range, infrared homing air-to-air missiles and is mainly designed for short range air-to-air combat. The aircraft is also used for close air support.

On 30 March 1962, the Soviet Union and China signed a technology transference arrangement pertaining to the MiG-21. Allegedly, while various kits, components, completed aircraft and associated documents were delivered to the Shenyang Aircraft Factory, the design documentation was incomplete, and Chinese designers made efforts to reverse engineer the aircraft. While the two aircraft are greatly similar, areas of difference include the hydraulic systems and internal fuel arrangements. During March 1964, domestic production of the J-7 reportedly commenced at the Shenyang Aircraft Factory, but due to various factors including the Cultural Revolution, mass production was only truly achieved during the 1980s. Numerous models of the J-7 were developed, featuring improvements in areas such as the armament, avionics, and wing design.

The aircraft is principally operated by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), but numerous international operators have bought their own J-7s. Outside of China, the largest operator of the J-7 is the Pakistan Air Force. Later generation Chinese aircraft, such as the Shenyang J-8 interceptor, were developed with the lessons learned from the J-7 programme. Several nations, including Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka, deployed the type in offensive roles.

In 2013, production of the J-7 was terminated after the delivery of 16 F-7BGI to the Bangladesh Air Force. Newer fighter aircraft, such as the JF-17 Thunder and Chengdu J-10 multirole fighters, have succeeded it in the export market. To date, large numbers of J-7s remain in service with multiple export customers, with PLAAF retiring the fleet in 2023.

==Design and development==
===Background===
In the 1950s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union shared a large proportion of its conventional weapons technology with its neighbor, China. One such example is the MiG-19, which was locally produced by China as the Shenyang J-6 from as early as 1958. During the same decade, the even more capable MiG-21 had been developed by the Soviets; this fighter, being inexpensive but fast, suited the strategy of forming large groups of &#x27;people&#x27;s fighters&#x27; to overcome the technological advantages of Western aircraft. However, the Sino-Soviet split abruptly ended initial cooperation efforts; between 28 July and 1 September 1960, the Soviet Union withdrew its advisers from China, resulting in the J-7 project coming to a halt in China.

During February 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev unexpectedly wrote to Mao Zedong to inform him that the Soviet Union was willing to transfer MiG-21 technology to China, and he asked the Chinese to promptly send their representatives to the Soviet Union to discuss arrangements. The Chinese viewed this offer as a Soviet gesture to make peace, while suspicious, they were nonetheless eager to take up the Soviet offer of an aircraft deal. A delegation headed by General Liu Yalou, the commander-in-chief of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and himself a Soviet military academy graduate, was dispatched to Moscow immediately; the Chinese delegation was given three days to visit the MiG-21&#x27;s production facility, which was previously off-limits to foreigners. The visit&#x27;s authorization was personally given by Nikita Khrushchev, and on 30 March 1962, the technology transfer deal was signed.

===Establishing production===
However, given the state of political relations between the two countries, the Chinese were not optimistic about gaining the technology, and allegedly made preparations to reverse engineer the aircraft. Russian sources state that several complete MiG-21s were sent to China, flown by Soviet pilots, while MiG-21Fs in kit form was also sent along with parts and technical documents. As the Chinese had expected, following the delivery of kits, parts and documents to Shenyang Aircraft Factory five months after the deal was signed, it was discovered that some technical documents provided by the Soviets were incomplete and that several parts could not be used.

China set about to engineer the aircraft for local production; in doing so, they successfully solved 249 major issues and reproduced eight major technical documents that were not provided by the Soviet Union. One of the major flaws was with the hydraulic systems, which grounded up to 70% of some squadron&#x27;s aircraft until upgrades were made. Another major modification was to the fuel storage, increasing the aircraft&#x27;s stability. The MiG-21 carries most of its fuel in the forward fuselage, causing the center of gravity to shift and become unstable after about 45 minutes of operation. The J-7 has redesigned fuel tanks and significantly larger drop tanks in order to maintain a more stable center of gravity, and therefore better Longitudinal static stability. The cockpit was also revised to replace the Soviet ejection seat, which was deemed to be unacceptable. The forward opening canopy was replaced by a standard rear-hinged canopy, which was jettisoned prior to ejection. The re-engineering effort was largely successful, as the Chinese-built J-7 showed only minor differences in design and performance from the original MiG-21.

During March 1964, domestic production of the J-7 reportedly commenced at the Shenyang Aircraft Factory. However, mass production efforts were severely hindered by an unexpected social and economic problem—the Cultural Revolution—that resulted in poor initial quality and slow progress. Achieving full domestic production had involved not only the local assembly of the aircraft itself, but the production of its various components and systems, including its turbojet powerplant. As a consequence, full-scale production of the J-7 was only truly achieved during the 1980s, by which time the original aircraft design was showing its age. By the 1980s, quantity production of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter was well underway in the United States; this relatively-affordable single-engined western fighter was considerably more agile than the J-7, even with the former carrying a greater payload.

===Further development===
In 1987, the J-7E was introduced, having a greatly improved wing, among other improvements. It was roughly 45% more maneuverable, and its takeoff and landing performance was greatly increased. It was also equipped with a helmet mounted sight, as well as being the first MiG-21 variant to be equipped with HOTAS and a multipurpose display. Many of the electronic components were British in origin, such as the gun sight and the multi purpose display. The aircraft is capable of using PL-8/Python 3 missiles with both the helmet mounted sight or the radar fire control, but the two are not connected. The pilot may use only one system at a time.

In the mid 1980s, Pakistan requested an aircraft with greater radar capabilities. Both the standard radar and the British Marconi radar were plagued by ground clutter, but China did not have any experience with air to ground radar at the time. In 1984, Pakistan provided assistance by having their American-trained F-16 pilots provide training on proper ground attack radar operation, which enabled the Chinese to develop the J-7M. In the late 1980s, the J-7MP and J-7PG introduced significant upgrades to the radar system by converting to an Italian FIAR Grifo-7 radar, more than tripled the effective range of the radar, as well as greatly increased the maximum angle for target detection.

The J-7 only reached its Soviet-designed capabilities in the mid 1980s. Being relatively affordable, it was widely exported as the F-7, often with Western systems incorporated, such as to Pakistan. There are over 20 different export variants of the J-7, some of which are equipped to use European weaponry, such as French R.550 Magic missiles. The Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Wings Over The Red Star&quot; series claims that the Chinese intercepted several Soviet MiG-21s en route to North Vietnam (during the Vietnam War), but these aircraft did not perform in a manner consistent with their original specifications, suggesting that the Chinese actually intercepted down-rated aircraft that were intended for export, rather than fully capable production aircraft. For this reason, the Chinese had to re-engineer the intercepted MiG-21 airframes in order to achieve their original capabilities. China later developed the Shenyang J-8 based both on the expertise gained by the program, and by utilizing the incomplete technical information acquired from the Soviet Ye-152 developmental jet.

During May 2013, production of the J-7 was permanently terminated, bringing to a close a period of manufacturing stretching almost 50 years.

At the China International Aviation &amp; Aerospace Exhibition in 2018, a display showing the J-7 as an unmanned platform was shown.

==Operational history==


===Africa===
;Namibia
During August 2005, Namibia ordered 12 F-7NMs for its air force; Chinese sources reported the delivery in November 2006. The model procured is believed to be a variation of the F-7PG acquired by Pakistan with Grifo MG radar.

;Nigeria

In early 2008, Nigeria procured 12 F-7NI fighters and three FT-7NI trainers to replace its existing inventory of MiG-21 fighters. On September 20, 2018, two Nigerian F-7Ni aircraft crashed into Katamkpehir, Abuja, killing one pilot after a mid-air collision during a rehearsal of an aerial display for the 58th anniversary of Nigeria&#x27;s independence.

;Sudan
During the lengthy Second Sudanese Civil War, Sudan procured a number of F-7s. In November 1993, it was reported that Iran had allegedly financed Sudan&#x27;s purchase of around 20 Chinese ground-attack aircraft, having pledged $17 million in financial aid to the Sudanese government and arranged for $300 million in Chinese arms to be delivered to the Sudanese Army.

;Tanzania
The Tanzanian Air Force deployed its F-7As during the Uganda–Tanzania War against Uganda and Libya, fought between 1978 and 1979. Forming a major component of Tanzania&#x27;s combat aircraft, the type facilitated the defeat of the nominally stronger Uganda Army Air Force during the air campaign.

;Zimbabwe
Due to their very limited operational capabilities in the absence of ground support from radars, Zimbabwean F-7s were never used in combat operations during the Second Congo War. Their only deployment in the DR Congo took place in January 2001, when four aircraft were to participate in the burial ceremony for the assassinated president, Laurent-Désiré Kabila. During the journey from Zimbabwe to Kinshasa, one of them crashed, with its pilot ejecting safely. Moreover, on the return trip, two aircraft were damaged on landing, although both were repaired and returned to service.

===Europe===

;Albania
The deployment of F-7As near the country&#x27;s northern border successfully checked Yugoslav incursions into Albanian airspace.

===East and Southeast Asia===
;China
Throughout the mid-1990s, the PLAAF began to replace its J-7B inventory with the substantially redesigned and improved J-7E variant. The wings of the J-7E have a new &quot;double delta&quot; design offering improved aerodynamics and increased fuel capacity, and the J-7E also features a more powerful engine and improved avionics. The newest version of the J-7, the J-7G, entered service with the PLAAF in 2003.

The principal role of the J-7 in Chinese service is to provide local air defense and tactical air superiority. Large numbers are to be employed to deter enemy air operations.

In June 2021, four J-7s participated in a combat drill conducted near Taiwan&#x27;s air defense identification zone.

The decommissioning of the J-7 began in 2018, with the whole fleet set to retire in 2023. According to the US Air Force China Aerospace Studies Institute, the retirement of J-7 marked the PLAAF&#x27;s transition to a fleet composed of only fourth-generation and fifth-generation aircraft. According to the Chinese media, PLAAF also considered turning J-7 into drones for training tools and aerial decoys.

;Myanmar

During the 1990s, Myanmar reportedly established four squadrons of F-7s, which have been primarily used for air defense duties. Technical difficulties have reportedly plagued the fleet early on, and their ground-attack performance was not deemed sufficient. Since then, Myanmar has improved the F-7 fleet&#x27;s capabilities via a modernisation programme. A series of upgrades were allegedly performed by a combination of Chinese and Israeli enterprises; although confirmed details on the arrangements have remained sparse, changes reportedly include the adoption of various Israeli-built missiles.

===Middle East===
;Iran
During the 1980s, Iran procured a number of F-7s, despite Chinese officials issuing denials of directly supplying military equipment to the country at that time. Despite its use as a frontline fighter, the type has not been involved in any known combat actions. By the 21st century, it was largely relegated to use as a trainer aircraft. The F-7 has also been used as a flying test bed for various indigenous technologies. In the recent years, maintaining the fleet&#x27;s operational status has reportedly become difficult. This is caused by the limited availability of spare parts, despite efforts by domestic industries to fill in, but also by the age of the airframes, which have accumulated excessive numbers of flight hours.

Iranian F-7s have featured in several movies, often portraying Iraqi MiG-21s during the Iran–Iraq War. One tells the story of an Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force strike on the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak on 30 September 1980. Another one, &quot;Attack on H3&quot;, tells the story of the 810 km-deep raid against Iraqi Air Force airfields on 4 April 1981, and other movies depicting the air combat in 1981 that resulted in the downing of around 70 Iraqi aircraft.

;Iraq
Iraqi F-7Bs were never used in combat, but only as advanced trainers.

===South Asia===
;Bangladesh

The Bangladeshi Air Force currently operates FT-7MB Airguards, and F-7BG and F-7BGI interceptors. The 16 F-7BGIs of the Bangladesh Air Force entered service in 2013. The F-7BGI is one of the most advanced variants, and the last production model of the F-7/J-7 family.
;Pakistan
During the 1980s, Pakistan launched Project Sabre II in an effort to increase the effectiveness of its F-7 fleet by redesigning and upgrading the airframe. The program produced to a design study which was drawn up by engineers from Northrop Grumman, China and Pakistan, but by 1989, the project was abandoned largely as a consequence of economic sanctions that the U.S. imposed on Pakistan. That same year, Grumman and China initiated a new design study in another attempt to redesign the F-7 but that effort was also abandoned when the U.S. placed sanctions on China in response to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. In 1991, a third initiative involving the F-7 was launched; originally known as the Fighter China project, it led to the creation of the JF-17 Thunder multirole fighter. The aircraft satisfied a requirement issued by the Pakistani Air Force for an affordable and modern combat aircraft, and the country is in the process of replacing its entire F-7 fleet with JF-17s.

;Sri Lanka

In 1991, the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) was looking for a jet attack aircraft to provide fast close air support to its army. With western countries refusing to sell attack aircraft, the Government of Sri Lanka approached China for the purchase of several Nanchang Q-5s, which had the range and payload capacity needed by the SLAF, and was already used by Pakistan and Bangladesh. Due to pressure from the west, China agreed to sell a small number of F-7BS fighters which allowed the SLAF to restore its capabilities that were lost a decade back. Due to the type&#x27;s comparative lack of endurance and payload, the SLAF has periodically used its F-7s for pilot training purposes. Early in 2008, the air force received six more advanced F-7Gs, to use primarily as interceptors. All of the F-7Gs, F-7BS&#x27; and FT-7s are flown by the No 5 Jet Squadron.

The SLAF has repeatedly deployed its F-7BS to conduct ground-attack missions against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Sri Lankan officials reported that on 9 September 2008, three F-7s were scrambled after two rebel-flown Zlín-143s were detected by a ground radar. Two F-7s were sent to bomb two rebel airstrips in the Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi areas, while the third reportedly intercepted one Zlín-143. According to the Sri Lankan government, the rebel-flown aircraft was shot down by the chasing F-7G using an air-to-air missile, as it was returning to Mullaitivu after a bombing run against Vavuniya Airport.

<doc id="377549" wikidata="Q21916" url="?curid=377549" title="Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong">
<text>The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) is a pro-Beijing political party registered since 1992 in Hong Kong. Chaired by Gary Chan and holding 13 Legislative Council seats, it is currently the largest party in the legislature and in terms of membership, far ahead of other parties. It has been a key supporting force to the SAR administration and the central government&#x27;s policies on Hong Kong.

The party was established in 1992 as the &quot;Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong&quot; by a group of traditional Beijing loyalists who pledged allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party. As the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong was approaching, the party actively participated in elections in the last years of the colonial rule and became one of the major party and the ally to the government in the early post-handover era.

The DAB took a major blow in the 2003 District Council election due to the unpopular Tung Chee-hwa administration and the proposed legislation of the Article 23 of the Basic Law. However, the party still managed to recover its loss in the following decades, further expanded its electoral base and membership and absorbed the pro-business Hong Kong Progressive Alliance in 2005, becoming the a dominant force in Hong Kong politics.

The party received electoral successes in the 2007 and 2011 District Council elections, winning 136 local elected offices at its peak, and won 13 seats in the 2012 Legislative Council election thanks to its effective electoral strategy. In the 2019 District Council elections, however, the party received a significant loss of four-fifth of its seats the midst of the widespread anti-government protests.

==History==
===Founding and the reunification (1992–1998)===
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong was founded as part of a wave of political party formations as Hong Kong approached its handover to China and amid electoral reform initiated by Governor Chris Patten. The 1991 Legislative Council election, which saw the defeat of all pro-Beijing candidates, was a catalyst to the forming of the DAB. In January 1992, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Lu Ping publicly encouraged the organisation of pro-Beijing political parties for the 1995 elections. Politicians from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) and other pro-Beijing organisations including the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers (FEW) formed the DAB on 10 July 1992, with Tsang Yok-sing as the party&#x27;s first chairperson. The DAB was the first major pro-Beijing party as a part of the &quot;United Front&quot; on the eve of the handover of Hong Kong.

Compared with other pro-Beijing parties in Hong Kong, the DAB was more grassroots-oriented. The 56 founding members of the DAB held political views that were sympathetic towards China and emphasised friendly Sino-Hong Kong relations. At the time of founding, many of them held political positions associated with the Chinese government or pro-Beijing groups in Hong Kong. Chairman Tsang Yok-sing was a delegate to Guangdong Province People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, vice-chairman Tam Yiu-chung and Chan Yuen-han were executive members of the pro-Beijing trade union FTU, and secretary Cheng Kai-nam was appointed by the Chinese government as the Hong Kong Affairs Advisor. Political scientist Sonny Lo Shiu-hing notes that early DAB members are also &quot;pro-Hong Kong&quot; in the sense that they advocate for the interests of Hong Kong and lobby Chinese officials.

The DAB became the direct rival to the major pro-democracy party United Democrats of Hong Kong and its successor Democratic Party, which was formed in 1994. The DAB first fielded a candidate in the 1993 Regional Council by-election and lost. In the following year, the DAB participated in the 1994 District Board elections, where 37 of its 83 candidates were elected. In 1995, it participated in the municipal elections, winning eight directly elected and two indirectly elected seats. Major leaders of the DAB participated in the 1995 Legislative Council election. It was regarded as test cases of the popularity of the new party. Three of the four party leaders were defeated by pro-democracy candidates in the election, including party chairman Tsang Yok-sing who lost to Liu Sing-lee of the Association for Democracy and People&#x27;s Livelihood (ADPL) in the Kowloon Central constituency.

The DAB took part in the preparation for establishing the Special Administrative Region on the eve of the handover of Hong Kong. In January 1996, Tsang Yok-sing, Tam Yiu-chung, Ng Hong-mun and Lee Cho-jat were appointed to the Preparatory Committee. It had 46 members elected to the Beijing-controlled Selection Committee in November 1996. In the following month, the Selection Committee elected 10 DAB members to the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC). The DAB and the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance (HKPA), another pro-Beijing party, allied with each other in the crucial Provisional Legislative Council debate on the substantial arrangements for the 1998 LegCo elections. This move was tacitly endorsed by the Heung Yee Kuk, and heralded as the unofficial merger of the parties. The Provisional Legislative Council, which was controlled by the pro-Beijing camp, vetoed the democratic reform introduced by the last British governor Chris Patten and replaced the first-past-the-post with the proportional representation method in the Legislative Council elections, so that the weaker DAB would be able to exploit the benefit of the proportional representation by taking a seat in every geographical constituency without having a majority of the votes. After the SAR was established, Tam Yiu-chung and was also appointed to the Executive Council by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa as the representative of the party.

===Early Tung Chee-hwa administration and Article 23 setback (1998–2003)===

The DAB&#x27;s electoral campaigns have been largely assisted by Beijing and its united front organs. The Liaison Office would mobilise various social groups and organisations to campaign for and to vote for the party, including employees of PRC state-owned companies and grassroots organisations such as the New Territories Association of Societies (NTAS) and the Kowloon Federation of Associations (KFA). The DAB&#x27;s sister organisation FTU also mobilised its workers to campaign for the DAB members. The FTU also sent a recommendation letter to its four hundred thousand members to seek support for DAB candidates.

In the 1998 LegCo election, the DAB took five directly elected seats with a quarter of the popular vote, compared to only two seats with 15% of the votes in the 1995 elections. According to Karl Ho, the change from a candidate-based system to an electoral list proportional representation system benefitted the DAB.

In December 1998, the party&#x27;s 5th Central Committee decided to increase a Vice-Chairmanship, Ip Kwok-him and Cheng Kai-nam were subsequently elected as vice-chairmen. In the first District Council elections in November 1999, the party filled in 176 candidates, 83 of which were elected, more than double compared to the 1994 elections.

In the second SAR LegCo elections in September 2000, despite the conflict of interests scandal of Cheng Kai-nam, the DAB became a clear winner, capturing 11 seats in total, 7 in geographical constituency direct elections, 3 in functional constituencies and 1 Election Committee constituency. Although Cheng Kai-nam was elected, he soon resigned his party posts and LegCo seat under public pressure. After DAB candidate Christopher Chung Shu-kun losing to pro-democracy Independent Audrey Eu in the 10 December Hong Kong Island by-election, the DAB commanded 10 LegCo seats by the end of 2000.

In July 2002 the beginning of the second term of Tung Chee-hwa&#x27;s administration, Chairman Tsang Yok-sing was appointed to the Executive Council under the Principal Officials Accountability System (POAS), succeeding Tam Yiu-chung. However the governing coalition between Tung Chee-hwa the DAB and the pro-business Liberal Party suffered from growing disunity as the popularity of Tung administration dropped. Although it continued provide stable support to the government as Beijing&#x27;s demand, it paid a hefty political price in the sense of increasing middle-class disaffection with the party and growing rank-and file complaint. The DAB was increasingly frustrated by unequal political exchange with the government and the skimpy political rewards meted out by Tung. Tsang Yok-sing even openly aired his displeasure and advocated power sharing with the government.

In the wake of the controversies over the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, which outlaws treason, sedition, subversion and secession against the central government, the image of DAB was severely undermined by its unconditional support and defence of the legislation. The November 2003 District Councils elections saw the worst electoral performance in party&#x27;s history, only 62 of the 206 candidates were elected. The party vice-chairman and LegCo member Ip Kwok-him was defeated in his own power base and long-time headquarter Kwun Lung by the pro-democracy The Frontier member and LegCo member Cyd Ho Sau-lan by a narrow margin of 64 votes. The election results led to the resignation of chairman Tsang Yok-sing. Tsang claimed that the electoral setback was due to the DAB&#x27;s &quot;Tung loyalist&quot; public image. In December the party&#x27;s Standing Committee elected Ma Lik as Tsang&#x27;s successor.

===Late 2000s expansion and electoral victories (2004–2012)===
The 2004 LegCo electoral campaign unfolded amid an economic rebound partly engineered by Beijing&#x27;s up-lifting measures. The PRC athletes&#x27; impressive gains in the August 2004 Athens Olympics and the 50 Chinese Gold Medalists&#x27; visit to Hong Kong right before the polling induced among the voters a strong nationalistic pride that was beneficial to DAB candidates. The DAB also managed to exploit the proportional representation to equalise votes for two of the candidates the party endorsed standing in the same constituency. Although support of Chan Yuen-han (FTU) was far higher than Chan Kam-lam (DAB) in Kowloon East, according to earlier polls, the two organisations managed to have both elected. At Hong Kong Island constituency, the ticket of Ma Lik and Choy So-yuk ultimately benefitted from a democratic camp mix-up that led to the resignation of the Democratic Party Chairman, Yeung Sum. The DAB become the largest political party in the Legislative Council to be represented with 12 seats (if including the two members ran under the FTU banner), with the pro-business Liberal Party coming second with 10 seats and the Democratic Party coming third with 9 seats.

On 16 February 2005, the DAB merged with the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, and was renamed as the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong. The two parties were merged with new committees and leadership in May, Ma Lik was re-elected as chairman and Ip Kwok-him, Tam Yiu-chung, Maria Tam and Lau Kong-wah as vice-chairmen. Since the merge with the Progressive Alliance, the DAB has gradually leaned to a more pro-middle-class position. In April 2007 leadership election, solicitor Gregory So succeeded Maria Tam as the vice-chairman of the party. The four new Standing Committee members were all professionals; besides Gregory So, Cheung Kwok-kwan, the Chairman of the Young DAB was a solicitor, Starry Lee Wai-king was an accountant, Ben Chan Han-pan was an engineer. Meanwhile, the pro-labour and pro-grassroots FTU faction began to run in elections in their own banner. On 8 August 2007, Chairman Ma Lik died of cancer in Guangzhou. Tam Yiu-chung was elected as the new chairman by the Standing Committee on 28 August.

The District Council Elections in 2007 saw the great bounce back of the DAB by winning 115 seats, more than a quarter of the seats in the district level, far ahead of other political parties. Gregory So resigned as the vice-chairman and was succeeded by Ann Chiang when he was appointed as the Under Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development by Chief Executive Donald Tsang in May 2008, among other DAB members appointed to the government. Gregory So was later revealed by the media as having Canadian citizenship, which he had to renounce as a result. The scandal became an electoral issue in the following 2008 LegCo Election that the pan-democracy camp used to attack the DAB candidates. Nevertheless, the DAB remained as the largest party in the Legislative Council in the election, winning 13 seats in total (if including the FTU candidates who had DAB membership). Chan Yuen-han and Wong Kwok-hing were founding members of the DAB and used to run for the DAB, they began to run under the FTU banner with more pro-labour position. In October, Tsang Yok-sing, the founding Chairman of the DAB, was elected as the President of the Legislative Council, becoming the first LegCo President with party membership. His seat at the Executive Council was succeeded by vice-chairman Lau Kong-wah.

In the 2011 District Council Elections, the DAB recorded a greatest victory in party&#x27;s history, accumulating 136 seats, about one-third of the total, more than all pro-democratic parties combined.

===Leung Chun-ying era (2012–2017)===
The DAB supported Leung Chun-ying in the 2012 Chief Executive election. In the Legislative Council elections in September, with the party&#x27;s first use of the electoral tactics of splitting candidate lists, the DAB won three seats in the New Territories West for the first time and two seats Hong Kong Island since 2004. It continued as the largest political force supporting the SAR administration today.

The DAB stood firmly with the government in the constitutional reform debate in 2014–15, and subsequently the massive Occupy protests against the 2014 NPCSC decision. On 17 April 2015, Starry Lee Wai-king became the first woman to chair the party, succeeding the outgoing Tam Yiu-chung. In the 2015 District Council election, the first election under Starry Lee&#x27;s chairmanship, the DAB retained its largest party status by winning 119 seats (including two who also ran under FTU banner), although incumbent legislators Christopher Chung and Elizabeth Quat were ousted by newcomers.

After the 2014 Occupy protests, there was an emerging pro-independence movement in which the DAB strongly opposed. In the 2016 New Territories East by-election, DAB member Holden Chow ran against the Civic Party&#x27;s Alvin Yeung and pro-independence Hong Kong Indigenous&#x27; Edward Leung. Chow received about 35 per cent and about 10,000 votes short of the Civic Party candidate.

With four veteran incumbents, LegCo president Tsang Yok-sing, Tam Yiu-chung, Chan Kam-lam and Ip Kwok-him, retiring, the DAB set a more conservative electoral strategy in the 2016 Legislative Council election, fielding only nine candidate lists in the geographical constituencies and District Council (Second) functional constituency, two fewer than the last election. The DAB got all their nine candidate lists elected as a result with three traditional functional constituencies with a drop of their vote share from 20.22 to 16.68 per cent vote share. Chan Hak-kan succeeded Ip as the new caucus convenor.

In the 2017 Chief Executive election, the DAB which commanded over 100 seats in the Election Committee, endorsed and nominated former Chief Secretary for Administration Carrie Lam, which help her to defeat former Financial Secretary John Tsang with 777 votes. In return, the Carrie Lam administration appointed Cheung Kwok-kwan to be a new member in the Executive Council.

=== Carrie Lam era (2017–2022) ===
In the March 2018 Legislative Council by-election triggered by the disqualification of Youngspiration&#x27;s Yau Wai-ching over the oath-taking controversy, the DAB supported its member Vincent Cheng and the former FTU legislator Tang Ka-piu who joined the DAB before the election to run in Kowloon West and New Territories East respectively. Despite Tang&#x27;s loss, Cheng made a surprising upset by narrowly defeating independent democrat Yiu Chung-yim, making it the first time the pro-Beijing camp received greater vote share than the pro-democrats in a geographical constituency since 2000 and the first time a pro-Beijing candidate won in a geographical constituency by-election since 1992.

In October 2020, Apple Daily reported that Carrie Lam had blamed the DAB for failing to raise political support for her administration, saying the DAB had failed for years in providing the government with &quot;talent.&quot; Lam was also reported to be unhappy with two government ministers from the DAB, and fired one but kept the other to avoid embarrassing the DAB.

In November 2020, following the expulsion of 4 pro-democracy lawmakers from the Legislative Council, the DAB expressed support for the decision and accused the pro-democracy lawmakers of harming the country&#x27;s interest.

In February 2021, following calls from Xia Baolong that only &quot;patriots&quot; should be part of the government, the DAB supported his position and said that it should be done, as it claimed pro-democracy figures had done things &quot;[I]ncluding advocating Hong Kong independence to poison young people, supporting black violence to damage the rule of law, colluding with foreign forces to interfere in Hong Kong&#x27;s affairs and even attempting to steal the power to govern by running in an election to paralyse the government.&quot;

=== John Lee era (2022–present) ===
In August 2022, after Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, the DAB said it fully supported the mainland Chinese government and military in response to the visit.

==Ideology==
The DAB is known as a Beijing loyalist party of &quot;loving China and loving Hong Kong&quot;. It stresses the &quot;one country&quot; part of the &quot;One country, two systems&quot; principle. As for issues on democratic reform, it takes a position to support slower pace in relative to what the Democratic Party supports, DAB claims by doing so stability and prosperity will be achieved. Former party chairman Tam Yiu-chung claims the DAB to be &quot;rational and pragmatic&quot;.

The party&#x27;s main claim is that it is natural for ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong to be &quot;patriotic&quot; and support the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The party supports nearly every policy of the HKSAR Government.

* Furthering co-operation between Hong Kong and the mainland, promoting mutual trust, and creating opportunities economically.
* &quot;Constructive monitor&quot; of the HKSAR government, scrutinising various government policies and decisions, providing &quot;constructive policy alternatives&quot; whilst securing the progress, prosperity, social stability and harmony for Hong Kong.
* To break down social barriers based on the common interest of Hong Kong; to strengthen communications with Hong Kong residents to better reflect their opinion; to be more accountable to the public.
* To nurture political talent by committing the necessary funding, organising training, providing opportunities for those who want to take part in politics.

The DAB&#x27;s support of social welfare improvements, including greater spending on education, housing, and employee retraining, has given it strong grassroots support.

The DAB was historically a left-wing party, but it is currently considered a big tent or centre-right party. It had leaned to a more pro-middle-class position and professional-oriented since its merger with the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance (HKPA) in 2005.

The party also takes a social conservative stance, espousing &#x27;traditional family values&#x27; and opposing same-sex marriage despite it not being in the party&#x27;s official platform. The DAB collaborated with evangelical Christian organisations in 2006 in drafting a submission on &quot;harmonious families&quot;. These organisations include the Hong Kong branches of the Full Gospel Business Men&#x27;s Fellowship International and the Christian Broadcasting Network.

As the largest political party of Hong Kong, the party can be divided into several main factions:
* Business sector, with business and professionals background and also former members of the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance.
* Rural leaders representing the interests of Indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories.
* Members with Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers background.
* Unionists, i.e. members belonging or came from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions.

==Controversies==
===Comments of Tiananmen massacre===
On 15 May 2007, then-party chairman Ma Lik provoked widespread condemnation within the local community when he claimed that &quot;there was not a massacre&quot; during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, as there was &quot;no intentional and indiscriminate shooting&quot;. He said the popular belief of foreigners&#x27; &quot;rash claims&quot; that a massacre took place showed Hong Kong&#x27;s lack of maturity. He said that Hong Kong showed, through this lack of patriotism and national identity, that it would thus &quot;not be ready for democracy until 2022&quot;.

Vice-chairman Tam Yiu-chung defended Ma, but questioned the timing: &quot;people will understand it gradually&quot;. However, Vice-chairman Lau Kong-wah, immediately offered to apologise, and distanced the party from Ma, saying that Ma had expressed &quot;a personal opinion&quot;. The DAB Central committee declined any further action against Ma following their meeting, and there was no official apology.

===Allegations of irregularities===
The DAB has been accused by pro-democracy media and politicians of providing benefits to certain people, including seafood meals and local trips to outlying islands at prices significantly lower than market rates to win their support. Other allegations include arranging free transport to mobilise people for their causes.

During the 2015 District Council elections, the South China Morning Post reported that elderly residents of care homes were being bussed to polling stations by DAB-arranged transport. A DAB candidate, Daniel Lam Tak-shing, was alleged to have instructed them on who to vote for outside of a polling station, raising questions on whether those votes were cast of their own will. He was also accused of giving out free gifts to these residents. However, none of these practices are strictly illegal in Hong Kong.

== Young DAB ==
The youth wing is the Young Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (Young DAB). In August 2022, it released results of a survey, showing that 30% of those polled in Hong Kong did not identify as being Chinese. The Young DAB said that the government should enhance national identity, and vice-chairman Nicholas Muk Ka-chun said that &quot;If you&#x27;ve looked at the Education Bureau&#x27;s website [...] you would have noticed that the word &#x27;patriot&#x27; does not exist&quot;.

<text>The following is a list of Sinitic languages and their dialects. For a traditional dialectological overview, see also varieties of Chinese.

== Classification ==
&quot;Chinese&quot; is a blanket term covering many different varieties spoken across China. Mandarin Chinese is the most popular dialect, and is used as a lingua franca across China.

Linguists classify these varieties as the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Within this broad classification, there are between seven and fourteen dialect groups, depending on the classification.

The conventionally accepted set of seven dialect groups first appeared in the second edition of the dialectology handbook edited by Yuan Jiahua (1961).
In order of decreasing number of speakers, they are:

# Mandarin (including Beijing and Nanjing variants)
# Wu (including the Shanghainese and Suzhounese variants)
# Yue (including the Cantonese and Taishanese variants)
# Min (including the Hokkien and Fuzhounese variants)
# Hakka (Kejia)
# Xiang (Hunanese)
# Gan (Jiangxinese)

The revised classification of Li Rong, used in the &quot;Language Atlas of China&quot; (1987) added three further groups split from these:

# Mandarin → Jin
# Wu → Huizhou
# Yue → Pinghua
# Min
# Hakka (Kejia)
# Xiang
# Gan

==Summary==

The number of speakers derived from statistics or estimates (2019) and were rounded:

== List of languages and dialects ==

In addition to the varieties listed below, it is customary to speak informally of dialects of each province (such as Sichuan dialect and Hainan dialect). These designations do not generally correspond to classifications used by linguists, but each nevertheless has characteristics of its own.

===Gan===
*赣语/贛語


=== Mandarin ===
* 官话/官話
The number of speakers derived from statistics or estimates (2019) and were rounded:

===Hui===
*徽语/徽語

Sometimes subcategory of Wu.
===Jin===
*晋语/晉語
Sometimes a subcategory of Mandarin.
===Hakka===
*客家话/客家話

=== Min ===
* 闽语/閩語


===Wu===
*吴语/吳語


===Xiang===
*湘语/湘語

===Yue===
*粤语/粵語


===Pinghua===

* 平话/平話
===Ba-Shu===
* 巴蜀语/巴蜀語
===Other===
The non-Min dialects of Hainan were once considered Yue, but are now left unclassified:
===Mixed languages===
In addition to the varieties within the Sinitic branch of Sino-Tibetan, a number of mixed languages also exist that comprise elements of one or more Chinese varieties with other languages.

== List in the &quot;Atlas&quot; ==
The extensive 1987 &quot;Language Atlas of China&quot; groups Chinese local varieties into the following units:
* Supergroup (大区 &quot;dàqū&quot;), of which there are but two: Mandarin and Min
* Group (区 &quot;qū&quot;), corresponding to the varieties of Chinese of the ISO standard
* Subgroup (片 &quot;piàn&quot;), which may be mutually unintelligible with other subgroups
* Cluster (小片 &quot;xiǎopiàn&quot;), which may be mutually unintelligible with other clusters
* Local dialect (点 &quot;diǎn&quot;), which are the dialects sampled by the &quot;Atlas&quot;

In the list below, local dialects are not listed. Groups are in bold, subgroups are numbered, and clusters are bulleted.

<text>Schistosoma is a genus of trematodes, commonly known as blood flukes. They are parasitic flatworms responsible for a highly significant group of infections in humans termed &quot;schistosomiasis&quot;, which is considered by the World Health Organization to be the second-most socioeconomically devastating parasitic disease (after malaria), infecting millions worldwide.

Adult flatworms parasitize blood capillaries of either the mesenteries or plexus of the bladder, depending on the infecting species. They are unique among trematodes and any other flatworms in that they are dioecious with distinct sexual dimorphism between male and female. Thousands of eggs are released and reach either the bladder or the intestine (according to the infecting species), and these are then excreted in urine or feces to fresh water. Larvae must then pass through an intermediate snail host before the next larval stage of the parasite emerges that can infect a new mammalian host by directly penetrating the skin.

==Evolution==

The origins of this genus remain unclear. For many years it was believed that this genus had an African origin, but DNA sequencing suggests that the species (&quot;S. edwardiense&quot; and &quot;S. hippopotami&quot;) that infect the hippo (&quot;Hippopotamus amphibius&quot;) could be basal. Since hippos were present in both Africa and Asia during the Cenozoic era, the genus might have originated as parasites of hippos. The original hosts for the South East Asian species were probably rodents.

Based on the phylogenetics of the host snails it seems likely that the genus evolved in Gondwana between and .

The sister group to &quot;Schistosoma&quot; is a genus of elephant-infecting schistosomes — &quot;Bivitellobilharzia&quot;.

The cattle, sheep, goat and cashmere goat parasite &quot;Orientobilharzia turkestanicum&quot; appears to be related to the African schistosomes. This latter species has since been transferred to the genus &quot;Schistosoma&quot;.

Within the haematobium group &quot;S. bovis&quot; and &quot;S. curassoni&quot; appear to be closely related as do &quot;S. leiperi&quot; and &quot;S. mattheei&quot;.

&quot;S. mansoni&quot; appears to have evolved in East Africa 0.43–0.30 million years ago.

&quot;S. mansoni&quot; and &quot;S. rodhaini&quot; appear to have shared a common ancestor between 107.5 and 147.6 thousand years ago. This period overlaps with the earliest archaeological evidence for fishing in Africa. It appears that &quot;S. mansoni&quot; originated in East Africa and experienced a decline in effective population size 20-90 thousand years ago before dispersing across the continent during the Holocene. This species was later transmitted to the Americas by the slave trade.

&quot;S. incognitum&quot; and &quot;S. nasale&quot; are more closely related to the African species rather than the japonicum group.

&quot;S. sinensium&quot; appears to have radiated during the Pliocene.

&quot;S. mekongi&quot; appears to have invaded South East Asia in the mid-Pleistocene.

Estimated speciation dates for the japonicum group: ~3.8 million years ago for &quot;S. japonicum&quot;/South East Asian schistosoma and ~2.5 million years ago for &quot;S. malayensis&quot;/&quot;S. mekongi&quot;.

&quot;Schistosoma turkestanicum&quot; is found infecting red deer in Hungary. These strains appear to have diverged from those found in China and Iran. The date of divergence appears to be 270,000 years before present.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Schistosoma&quot; as currently defined is paraphyletic, so revisions are likely. Over twenty species are recognised within this genus.

The genus has been divided into four groups: indicum, japonicum, haematobium and mansoni. The affinities of the remaining species are still being clarified.

Thirteen species are found in Africa. Twelve of these are divided into two groups—those with a lateral spine on the egg (mansoni group) and those with a terminal spine (haematobium group).

===Mansoni group===
The four mansoni group species are: &quot;S. edwardiense&quot;, &quot;S. hippotami&quot;, &quot;S. mansoni&quot; and &quot;S. rodhaini&quot;.

===Haematobium group===
The nine &quot;haematobium&quot; group species are: &quot;S. bovis&quot;, &quot;S. curassoni&quot;, &quot;S. guineensis&quot;, &quot;S. haematobium&quot;, &quot;S. intercalatum&quot;, &quot;S. kisumuensis&quot;, &quot;S. leiperi&quot;, &quot;S. margrebowiei&quot; and &quot;S. mattheei&quot;.

&quot;S. leiperi&quot; and &quot;S. matthei&quot; appear to be related. &quot;S. margrebowiei&quot; is basal in this group. &quot;S. guineensis&quot; is the sister species to the &quot;S. bovis&quot; and &quot;S. curassoni&quot; grouping. &quot;S. intercalatum&quot; may actually be a species complex of at least two species.

===Indicum group===
The &quot;indicum&quot; group has three species: &quot;S. indicum&quot;, &quot;S. nasale&quot; and &quot;S. spindale&quot;. This group appears to have evolved during the Pleistocene. All use pulmonate snails as hosts. &quot;S. spindale&quot; is widely distributed in Asia, Africa, and India..

&quot;S. indicum&quot; is found in India and Thailand.

The indicum group appears to be the sister clade to the African species.

===Japonicum group===
The &quot;japonicum&quot; group has five species: &quot;S. japonicum&quot;, &quot;S. malayensis&quot; and &quot;S. mekongi&quot;, &quot;S. ovuncatum&quot; and &quot;S. sinensium&quot; and these species are found in China and Southeast Asia.

&quot;S. ovuncatum&quot; forms a clade with &quot;S. sinensium&quot; and is found in northern Thailand. The definitive host is unknown and the intermediate host is the snail &quot;Tricula bollingi&quot;. This species is known to use snails of the family Pomatiopsidae as hosts.

&quot;S. incognitum&quot; appears to be basal in this genus. It may be more closely related to the African-Indian species than to the Southeast Asian group. This species uses pulmonate snails as hosts. Examination of the mitochondria suggests that &quot;Schistosoma incognitum&quot; may be a species complex.

===New species===
As of 2012, four additional species have been transferred to this genus., previously classified as species in the genus &quot;Orientobilharzia&quot;. Orientobilharzia differs from Schistosoma morphologically only on the basis of the number of testes. A review of the morphological and molecular data has shown that the differences between these genera are too small to justify their separation. The four species are

*&quot;Schistosoma bomfordi&quot;
*&quot;Schistosoma datta&quot;
*&quot;Schistosoma harinasutai&quot;
*&quot;Schistosoma turkestanicum&quot;

===Hybrids===
The hybrid &quot;S. haematobium-S.guineenis&quot; was observed in Cameroon in 1996. &quot;S. haematobium&quot; could establish itself only after deforestation of the tropical rainforest in Loum next to the endemic &quot;S. guineensis&quot;; hybridization led to competitive exclusion of &quot;S. guineensis&quot;.
In 2003, a &quot;S. mansoni-S. rodhaini&quot; hybrid was found in snails in western Kenya, As of 2009, it had not been found in humans.

In 2009, &quot;S. haematobium–S. bovis&quot; hybrids were described in northern Senegalese children. The Senegal River Basin had changed very much since the 1980s after the Diama Dam in Senegal and the Manantali Dam in Mali had been built. The Diama dam prevented ocean water to enter and allowed new forms of agriculture. Human migration, increasing number of livestock and sites where human and cattle both contaminate the water facilitated mixing between the different schistosomes in N&#x27;Der, for example. The same hybrid was identified during the 2015 investigation of a schistosomiasis outbreak on Corsica, traced to the Cavu river.

In 2019, a &quot;S. haematobium–S. mansoni&quot; hybrid was described in a 14-year-old patient with hematuria from Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

===Cladogram===
A cladogram based on 18S ribosomal RNA, 28S ribosomal RNA, and partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) genes shows phylogenic relations of species in the genus &quot;Schistosoma&quot;:

==Comparison of eggs==
==Geographical distribution==
Geographical areas associated with schistosomiasis by the World Health Organization as of January 2017 include in alphabetical order: Africa, Brazil, Cambodia, the Caribbean, China, Corsica, Indonesia, Laos, the Middle East, the Philippines, Suriname, and Venezuela. There had been no cases in Europe since 1965, until an outbreak occurred on Corsica.

==Schistosomiasis==
The parasitic flatworms of &quot;Schistosoma&quot; cause a group of chronic infections called schistosomiasis known also as bilharziasis. An anti-schistosome drug is a schistosomicide.

===Species infecting humans===
Parasitism of humans by &quot;Schistosoma&quot; appears to have evolved at least three occasions in both Asia and Africa.

*S. guineensis, a recently described species, is found in West Africa. Known snail intermediate hosts include &quot;Bulinus forskalii.&quot;
*S. haematobium, commonly referred to as the &quot;bladder fluke&quot;, originally found in Africa, the Near East, and the Mediterranean basin, was introduced into India during World War II. Freshwater snails of the genus &quot;Bulinus&quot; are an important intermediate host for this parasite. Among final hosts humans are most important. Other final hosts are rarely baboons and monkeys.
*S. intercalatum. The usual final hosts are humans. Other animals can be infected experimentally.
*S. japonicum, whose common name is simply &quot;blood fluke&quot;, is widespread in East Asia and the southwestern Pacific region. Freshwater snails of the genus &quot;Oncomelania&quot; are an important intermediate host for &quot;S. japonicum.&quot; Final hosts are humans and other mammals including cats, dogs, goats, horses, pigs, rats and water buffalo.
*S. malayensis This species appears to be a rare infection in humans and is considered to be a zoonosis . The natural vertebrate host is Müller&#x27;s giant Sunda rat (&quot;Sundamys muelleri&quot;). The snail hosts are Robertsiella species (&quot;R. gismanni&quot;, &quot;R. kaporensis&quot; and &quot;R. silvicola&quot; (see Attwood et al. 2005 Journal of Molluscan Studies Volume 71, Issue 4 pp. 379–391).
*S. mansoni, found in Africa, Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, the lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. It is also known as &quot;Manson&#x27;s blood fluke&quot; or &quot;swamp fever&quot;. Freshwater snails of the genus &quot;Biomphalaria&quot; are an important intermediate host for this trematode. Among final hosts humans are most important. Other final hosts are baboons, rodents and raccoons.
*S. mekongi is related to &quot;S. japonicum&quot; and affects both the superior and inferior mesenteric veins. &quot;S. mekongi&quot; differs in that it has smaller eggs, a different intermediate host (&quot;Neotricula aperta&quot;) and longer prepatent period in the mammalian host. Final hosts are humans and dogs. The snail &quot;Tricula aperta&quot; can also be experimentally infected with this species.

===Species infecting other animals===
&quot;Schistosoma indicum&quot;, &quot;Schistosoma nasale&quot;, &quot;Schistosoma spindale&quot;, &quot;Schistosoma leiperi&quot; are all parasites of ruminants.

&quot;Schistosoma edwardiense&quot; and &quot;Schistosoma hippopotami&quot; are parasites of the hippo.

&quot;Schistosoma ovuncatum&quot; and &quot;Schistosoma sinensium&quot; are parasites of rodents.

==Morphology==
Adult schistosomes share all the fundamental features of the digenea. They have a basic bilateral symmetry, oral and ventral suckers, a body covering of a syncytial tegument, a blind-ending digestive system consisting of mouth, esophagus and bifurcated caeca; the area between the tegument and alimentary canal filled with a loose network of mesoderm cells, and an excretory or osmoregulatory system based on flame cells. Adult worms tend to be long and use globins from their hosts&#x27; hemoglobin for their own circulatory system.

==Reproduction==

Unlike other trematodes and basically all other flatworms, the schistosomes are dioecious, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the sexes are separate. The two sexes display a strong degree of sexual dimorphism, and the male is considerably larger than the female. The male surrounds the female and encloses her within his &quot;gynacophoric canal&quot; for the entire adult lives of the worms. As the male feeds on the host&#x27;s blood, he passes some of it to the female. The male also passes on chemicals which complete the female&#x27;s development, whereupon they will reproduce sexually. Although rare, sometimes mated schistosomes will &quot;divorce&quot;, wherein the female will leave the male for another male. The exact reason is not understood, although it is thought that females will leave their partners to mate with more genetically distant males. Such a biological mechanism would serve to decrease inbreeding, and may be a factor behind the unusually high genetic diversity of schistosomes.

==Genome==
The genomes of &quot;Schistosoma haematobium&quot;, &quot;S. japonicum&quot; and &quot;S. mansoni &quot;have been reported.

==History==
The eggs of these parasites were first seen by Theodor Maximilian Bilharz, a German pathologist working in Egypt in 1851 who found the eggs of &quot;Schistosoma haematobium&quot; during the course of a post mortem. He wrote two letters to his former teacher von Siebold in May and August 1851 describing his findings. Von Siebold published a paper in 1852 summarizing Bilharz&#x27;s findings and naming the worms &quot;Distoma haematobium&quot;. Bilharz wrote a paper in 1856 describing the worms more fully. Their unusual morphology meant that they could not be comfortably included in &quot;Distoma&quot;. So in 1856 Meckel von Helmsback (de) created the genus &quot;Bilharzia&quot; for them. In 1858 David Friedrich Weinland proposed the name &quot;Schistosoma&quot; (Greek: &quot;split body&quot;) because the worms were not hermaphroditic but had separate sexes. Despite &quot;Bilharzia&quot; having precedence, the genus name &quot;Schistosoma&quot; was officially adopted by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. The term &quot;Bilharzia&quot; to describe infection with these parasites is still in use in medical circles.

Bilharz also described &quot;Schistosoma mansoni&quot;, but this species was redescribed by Louis Westenra Sambon in 1907 at the London School of Tropical Medicine who named it after his teacher Patrick Manson.

In 1898, all then known species were placed in a subfamily by Stiles and Hassel. This was elevated to family status by Looss in 1899. Poche in 1907 corrected a grammatical error in the family name. The life cycle of &quot;Schistosoma mansoni&quot; was determined by the Brazilian parasitologist Pirajá da Silva (1873-1961) in 1908.

In 2009, the genomes of &quot;Schistosoma mansoni&quot; and &quot;Schistosoma japonicum&quot; were decoded opening the way for new targeted treatments. In particular, the study discovered that the genome of &quot;S. mansoni&quot; contained 11,809 genes, including many that produce enzymes for breaking down proteins, enabling the parasite to bore through tissue. Also, &quot;S. mansoni&quot; does not have an enzyme to make certain fats, so it must rely on its host to produce these.

<text>The Shenyang J-5 (: 歼-5) (NATO reporting name &quot;Fresco&quot;) is a Chinese-built single-seat jet interceptor and fighter aircraft derived from the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17. The J-5 was exported as the F-5 and was originally designated Dongfeng-101 (East Wind-101) and also Type 56 before being designated J-5 in 1964.

The MiG-17 was license-built in China and Poland into the 1960s. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) obtained a number of Soviet-built MiG-17 Fresco-A day fighters, designated J-4 in the early 1950s. To introduce modern production methods to Chinese industry the PLAAF obtained plans for the MiG-17F Fresco-C day fighter in 1955, along with two completed pattern aircraft, 15 knockdown kits, and parts for ten aircraft. The first Chinese-built MiG-17F, (serialed &quot;Zhong 0101&quot;), produced by the Shenyang factory, performed its initial flight on 19 July 1956 with test pilot Wu Keming at the controls.

Plans were obtained in 1961 for the MiG-17PF interceptor and production began, as the J-5A (F-5A), shortly afterwards. At this time the Sino-Soviet split occurred, causing much disruption to industrial and technical projects, so the first J-5A did not fly until 1964, when the type was already obsolete. A total of 767 J-5s and J-5As had been built when production ended in 1969.

The Chinese also built a two-seat trainer version of the MiG-17, designated the Chengdu JJ-5 (Jianjiji Jiaolianji - Fighter Trainer - FT-5), from 1968, by combining the two-seat cockpit of the MiG-15UTI, the VK-1A engine of the J-5, and the fuselage of the J-5A. All internal armament was deleted and a single Nudelman-Richter NR-23 23 mm cannon was carried in a ventral pack. Production of the JJ-5 reached 1,061 when it ceased in 1986, with the type exported to a number of countries.

==Operational history==
The J-5 and JJ-5 saw widespread use by the PLAAF until supplanted by more capable aircraft the Shenyang J-6 and later Chengdu J-7.

==Variants==
* Type 56 - pre-service designation for the J-5.
* Dongfeng-101 - original service name for the J-5.
* Shenyang J-5 - (Jianjiji-5 - fighter) Chinese production aircraft re-designated in 1964. 767 built, all single-seat variants.
* Shenyang J-5A - licence production of the radar-equipped Mig-17PF. The total production figure for this variant was over 300. J-5As were still in service with the PLAAF when J-6A &amp; J-6B were phased out.
* Chengdu JJ-5 - (Jianjiji Jiaolianji - fighter trainer) A twin-seat trainer version of the J-5 designed and developed by Chengdu Aircraft Corporation. Combined the J-5 airframe, J-5A airbrakes and the tandem twin-seat cockpit section of the JJ-2 (MiG-15UTI).
* Shenyang J-5 torpedo bomber - A single aircraft modified to carry a single torpedo under the fuselage centreline. The central cannon was removed, as was some fuel storage capacity. Trials showed performance degradation was too great and further work was abandoned.
* F-5 - Export version of the J-5.
* FT-5 - Export version of the JJ-5.

== Surviving aircraft ==
The Jianchuan Museum Cluster has one JJ-5.

==Operators==

===Current operators===
* North Korean Air Force — 106 Shenyang F-5s and 135 Shenyang FT-5s are in service. However, reports of dire levels of serviceability suggest an airworthiness rate of less than 50%.
===Former operators===
;
* Albanian Air Force — Twelve F-5s and eight FT-5s were delivered, with an additional 58 F-5s subsequently acquired. Shenyang J-5 jets were among the first Chinese military aid to Albania. However, their deployment against the Yugoslav air incursions was relatively unsuccessful due to their subsonic speed, and the aircraft were soon reassigned once Shenyang J-6s became available. Remaining J-5s are retired and in storage.
* Bangladeshi Air Force — All retired in 1980.
* Khmer Air Force — Ten Shenyang J-5 jets were delivered to the then Royal Khmer Aviation (AVRK) in 1965 as military aid. Only six were operational by 1970, only to be lost in January 1971 when the Cambodian Air Force was almost entirely destroyed on the ground by a North Vietnamese Army (NVA) Sapper attack.
* People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force 
* People&#x27;s Liberation Army Naval Air Force
* Indonesian Air Force — 12 J-5s were delivered in 1959, retired in 1970.
* Pakistan Air Force — Retired 5 January 2012. The PAF&#x27;s No. 1 Fighter Conversion Unit (FCU) operated more than 25 FT-5 trainers from 1975 to 2012, replaced in service by Pakistani-built K-8P Karakorums.
* Sri Lankan Air Force — J-5s were used as jet familiarisation trainers for Sri Lankan Air Force pilots.
* Sudanese Air Force — 16 F-5s and FT-5s were delivered in 1969. Another FT-5 was received around 1983. Lastly, two FT-5s might have been ordered in 2001. Sudanese Air Force F-5s might have been used for ground attack missions against members of the Ansar movement in 1970.
* Tanzanian Air Force — Up to 22 FT-5 trainers delivered, starting in 1973.
* Vietnamese Air Force — The Vietnamese Air Force used J-5s alongside the Soviet-supplied MiG-17s for interception missions until the 1990s when they were retired, along with the remaining MiG-19s, being replaced with newer MiG-21s and Su-27s.
* Zambia Air Force - 12 F-5s and FT-5s delivered, probably between 1976 and 1978.
* Air Force of Zimbabwe — Two FT-5s leased by China as trainers for Chengdu F-7s around 1986. They were later replaced by two twin-seat FT-7BZs, and returned to China by the mid-1990s.

A revival of the typeface was designed in 1974 by Ed Benguiat and Vic Caruso for the International Typeface Corporation (ITC). Their version follows the formulary ITC approach of increased x-height, and multiple weights from light to ultra. The face is named for the ancient Greek poet.

== Notable uses ==
Korinna is known for its usage in television. It is perhaps best known as the display font for clues on the 1984 version of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. It was also used on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; from 1986 to 1988, as the chapter placard typeface for the television series &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Hank Parker&#x27;s Outdoor Magazine&quot;, TNN&#x27;s &quot;New Country&quot;, and &quot;Mork and Mindy&quot;, &quot;The Joy of Painting&quot; public television series from 1986 to 1989, and for home videos such as Paramount Home Video&#x27;s warning screen from 1989 to 1995. Japanese video game developer and publisher Capcom has always used the Korinna typeface, for both its former and current logos. The Walt Disney Company used the font when re-releasing its animated features to theatres and VHS by labelling them as &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Classic&quot; on the movie posters and VHS covers, the word &quot;classic&quot; in Korinna typeface. The font was used for title and heading text on some &quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot; books and is used for the current GURPS logo. It was also used to render the subtitle text in the music video to Devo&#x27;s &quot;Whip It&quot;. It features prominently as cover typeface of every &quot;The Most Famous Hotels in the World Book&quot; since 1986. It is also used as the primary textual font in many newspapers both local and nationwide.

<doc id="377582" wikidata="Q962805" url="?curid=377582" title="Nanchang Q-5">
<text>The Nanchang Q-5 (; NATO reporting name: [[Fan-Tan|Fantan]]), also known as the A-5 in its export versions, is a 1960s-design Chinese-built single-seat, twin jet engine ground-attack aircraft based on the Shenyang J-6. The aircraft is primarily used for close air support.

==Design and development==
The PRC was an enthusiastic user of the MiG-19, which it manufactured locally as the Shenyang J-6 from 1958. In August 1958, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army requested development of a jet attack aircraft for the air support role.

Lu Xiaopeng was appointed chief designer of this project. Lu also designed the J-12 fighter jet. Although based on the MiG-19, the new design, designated Qiangjiji-5 (fifth attack aircraft design), had a longer fuselage, area ruled to reduce transonic drag and accommodate a 4 m (13-ft) long internal weapons bay. The air intakes were moved to the fuselage sides to make space in the nose for a planned target radar (which was never actually fitted). New wings with greater area and reduced sweep were incorporated. The Q-5 shares the J-6&#x27;s Liming Wopen WP-6 A (Tumansky RD-9) turbojet engines. The redesign cost some high-altitude speed, but the Q-5 is as fast as the MiG-19/J-6 at low level, thanks largely to the area-ruled fuselage.

Fixed armament of the Q-5 was reduced to two Type 23-1 23 mm cannon with 100 rounds per gun, mounted in the wing roots. Two pylons under each wing and two pairs of tandem pylons under the engines were provided in addition to the weapons bay. A total of 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) of ordnance could be carried internally, with an additional 1,000 kg externally. On many aircraft the weapons bay is now used primarily for an auxiliary fuel tank.

Production drawings were completed in 1960 allowing construction of prototypes to begin, but the political climate in China resulted in the project being canceled in 1961. A small team kept the program alive until work restarted in earnest at Nanchang. The first flight finally occurred on 4 July 1965. Series production began in 1969, with squadron delivery starting in 1970.

About 1,300 aircraft were produced, 600 of them being the updated Q-5A. A small number, perhaps a few dozen, Q-5As were modified to carry nuclear weapons; these are believed to retain their internal weapons bay. A long-range Q-5I, introduced in 1983, added a fuel tank instead of the internal weapons bay, compensating for that with the provision of two additional underwing pylons. Some of these aircraft serve with the PLA Navy, and have apparently been equipped with radar to guide anti-ship missiles. Subsequent minor upgrades include the Q-5IA, with a new gun/bomb sighting system and avionics, and the Q-5II, with radar warning receiver (RWR).

In the 1980s, the aircraft was exported to nations such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and is often known as the A-5 in those nations.

Plans for an upgraded Q-5/A-5 with Western equipment and new navigation and attack (nav/attack) systems were largely aborted following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, but the aircraft continued in service until its retirement in 2010. It is a capable light attack aircraft, although its limited navigation and weapons-delivery systems are inferior to more modern aircraft.

In more recent years, the PLAAF has begun to field newer models of the Q-5, that incorporate some of the technology developed during the canceled Q-5M and Q-5K projects. The Q-5 introduces a nose-mounted laser rangefinder, and a laser designator is also likely to be fitted since the aircraft is said to be able to deliver laser-guided bombs. The Q-5A variant is believed to be capable of delivering nuclear munitions. The Q-5D is an upgrade with new avionics, including a HUD and a new navigation system. The Q-5E and Q-5F models are reportedly being worked on, though little is known about them at this time.

==Operational history==
The Sudanese Air Force employed its A-5 attack jets during the War in Darfur.

In March 2015, some Myanmar Air Force A-5C jets flying sorties against the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, accidentally dropped bombs on a Chinese village in Gengma County, Yunnan inside the Chinese border, killing 4 villagers, with the PLA responding by deploying HQ-12 surface-to-air missiles and fighter jets.

On 20 April 2017 two Q-5s were seen in Bohai Bay practicing air strikes against ground targets in the wake of increased tensions on the Korean peninsula.

The Q-5 was replaced by the Xi&#x27;an JH-7 during the 2010s.

==Variants==

===Domestic variants===


*Q-5: Original production version with a total of 6 pylons, two under each wing and two under the fuselage, and was superseded by the Q-5A.
*Q-5Jia: Q-5 modified to carry nuclear bombs, only a very limited number were built. 317Jia radar was tested as improvement program. One of such aircraft is currently on display at the aviation museum in Beijing.
*Q-5Yi: Torpedo attacker for navy, only few manufactured. YJ-8 anti-ship missile was also being considered, but the program was cancelled due to budget problem even though the missile was well developed, and afterwards missile test launches were conducted from Type 24 missile boat. In eighties, YJ-81 was once mounted for test, but this proposition was soon rejected when it was decided to let JH-7 take the role.
*Q-5I (Q-5A): Q-5 with the internal weapon bay replaced by internal fuel tank, increasing fuel capacity over 70%. Like all previous Q-5 variants, navigation was still a bottle neck with the result being that aircraft must fly longer times in more complex search patterns in long range strikes. However, this problem is somewhat reduced by the increased fuel capacity. An indigenous Type 79Y4 laser rangefinder developed by No. 613 Institute was fitted.
*Q-5IA (Q-5B): Improved Q-5I, radar warning receiver and flare dispensers added, the original weapon aiming sight of the Q-5 was developed by No. 5311 Factory, and named as SH-1, short for &quot;S&quot;he – &quot;H&quot;ong (Shoot-Bomb-1 / 射轰-1), which only had limited capability because attacks could only be carried out at a fixed angle. No. 5311 Factory developed an improved version SH-1I (射轰-1甲) to allow the attack to be carried out at different angles. Extra outer pylon under each wing added for PL-2/PL-5 air-to-air missiles, bombs or rocket launchers.
*Q-5II (Q-5C): Q-5I with omnidirectional radar warning receivers. Later, Type 205 pulse doppler navigation radar was installed on several planes to solve the navigation problem.
*Q-5III: Foreign trade variant, export name A-5III/A-5C, Project Long6(Dragon Six). Total 10 pylons, with 1 extra pylon under each wing for R-550/AIM-9 air-to-air missiles. See also Export variants.
*Q-5 with indigenous nav/attack system: Project CC, Q-5I with indigenous Type 205 doppler navigation system, Q5HK-15 laser rangefinder and SH-1IIA sight. One year later, head-up display and air data computer were incorporated into system. The whole system finally got approved in 1992, and relevant technology was applied to Q-5D several years later.
*Q-5IV (Q-5M, Q-5D(old)): Project CI. Joint Chinese-Italian project to upgrade the Q-5II with Italian avionics from the AMX International AMX attack fighter. Avionics would include a ranging radar, head-up display, inertial navigation system, air data computer and dual central computers all integrated via dual-redundant MIL-STD-1553B databus. Completion and first deliveries were to take place in late 1988 and early 1989 respectively. 28.8% change in comparison to the closest earlier version. Two central computers like that of Q-5M and new RW-30 radar warning receivers were added. ALR-1 laser rangefinder and QHK-10 Head-Up Display developed by No. 613 Institute were added. Although the project was influenced after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, it was approved to continue by China and Italy in 1992, new upgrade items such as IFIR and ELINT, etc., were put into program. Due to the loss of time, it failed to enter production. See also Export variants.
*Q-5D(C): Composite material demonstrator for Q-5D(old).
*Q-5IIGai (Q-5K, Q-5E(old)): Project CF, joint Chinese-French project to upgrade Q-5II with French avionics, such as VE110 head-Up Display, ULIS91 inertial navigation system, TMV630 laser rangefinder and other electro-optics. Like the Q-5M/A-5M, the project was cancelled after the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989. So some indigenous equipment such as doppler radar, jammer etc., were used to achieve further progress. It was terminated in 1993.
*Q-5D: Interim attack aircraft introduced during the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the separate doppler navigation system and GPS of the Q-5C was replaced by the DG-1 integrated doppler navigation/GPS system. Other systems included the ALR-1 Laser rangefinder/Marked Target seeker and QHK-10 Head-Up Display. A new weapon aiming sight, the SH-1II (射轰-1乙), replaced the older SH-1I (射轰-1甲), and No. 5311 Factory managed to successfully integrate this sight with the new laser rangefinder and Type 205 navigation radar.
*Q-5E: New pylon with ability to mount laser-guided bombs such as LS-500J LGB, fire control system also improved. Laser pod is absent from the plane due to weight issue.
*Q-5F: Laser designator pod carrier, special large belly right pylon mounted for laser targeting pod, which is always false recognized as semi-buried electro-optical targeting pod.
*Q-5G: Q-5E with belly conformal fuel tank to solve the range problem.
*JQ-5J: Tandem two seater of Q-5. The manufacturer claimed that it can be used as forward air control like the OA-10A, and providing targeting information via data links. The rear seat is 286 millimetres higher than the front seat, enables the back-seat pilot to have a 5 degree field of vision, and the canopy opens to the right. When used as a trainer, the rear cockpit control can override that of the front cockpit.
*Q-5L – Upgraded Q-5C, with LLLTV/FLIR vision systems for a day/night capability. Infrared imaging and television cameras were mounted on nose orb. Other improvements include Head Up Display, GPS Rx, INS, TACAN, and chaff/flare dispensers. Weapons capability include the Chinese LS-500J laser-guided glide bombs with a 12 km range. Optional belly conformal fuel tank.
*Q-5N – Upgraded Q-5D with same upgrade program as Q-5L, main difference is navigation system of Q-5D.

===Export variants===
*A-5: Export designation for version of the Q-5 to North Korea in 1970s that appeared in Chinese media. The designation contains more than one variant since the Chinese military aid to North Korea is protracted, but it&#x27;s not clear whether this export version is derived from Q-5, Q-5A, Q-5I or Q-5IA.
*A-5IIA: Modified version of Q-5II, sold to Sudan.
*A-5IIIK: Export version of Q-5III sold to Myanmar.
*A-5III/A-5C: Export version with western equipment upon customers&#x27; requests, such as flight instrumentation made by Rockwell Collins, and western ejection seat made by Martin-Baker. Added the capability to fire western weaponry such as the French SNEB, Matra Durandal ,R550 Magic or US AIM-9 Sidewinders. Exported to Pakistan.
*A-5IV/A-5M: Export version of Q-5M with more western equipment such as flight instrumentation made by Rockwell Collins, and western ejection seat made by Martin-Baker. Added the capability to fire western missiles such as the R550 Magic or AIM-9 Sidewinder. Myanmar ordered, but chose A-5IIIK instead after program extension. Evaluated by the Pakistan Air Force in 1990.

<doc id="377585" wikidata="Q601359" url="?curid=377585" title="Battle of Fort Donelson">
<text>The Battle of Fort Donelson was fought from February 11–16, 1862, in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. The Union capture of the Confederate fort near the Tennessee–Kentucky border opened the Cumberland River, an important avenue for the invasion of the South. The Union&#x27;s success also elevated Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant from an obscure and largely unproven leader to the rank of major general, and earned him the nickname of &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; Grant.

Following his capture of Fort Henry on February 6, Grant moved his army (later to become the Union&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee) overland to Fort Donelson, from February 11 to 13, and conducted several small probing attacks. On February 14, Union gunboats under Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote attempted to reduce the fort with gunfire, but were forced to withdraw after sustaining heavy damage from the fort&#x27;s water batteries.

On February 15, with the fort surrounded, the Confederates, commanded by Brig. Gen. John B. Floyd, launched a surprise attack, led by his second-in-command, Brig. Gen. Gideon Johnson Pillow, against the right flank of Grant&#x27;s army. The intention was to open an escape route for retreat to Nashville, Tennessee. Grant was away from the battlefield at the start of the attack, but arrived to rally his men and counterattack. Pillow&#x27;s attack succeeded in opening the route, but Floyd lost his nerve and ordered his men back to the fort. The following morning, Floyd and Pillow escaped with a small detachment of troops, relinquishing command to Brig. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, who accepted Grant&#x27;s demand of unconditional surrender later that evening. The battle resulted in virtually all of Kentucky as well as much of Tennessee, including Nashville, falling under Union control.

==Background==
===Military situation===


The battle of Fort Donelson, which began on February 12, took place shortly after the surrender of Fort Henry, Tennessee, on February 6, 1862. Fort Henry had been a key position in the center of a line defending Tennessee, and the capture of the fort now opened the Tennessee River to Union troop and supply movements. About 2,500 of Fort Henry&#x27;s Confederate defenders escaped before its surrender by marching the 12 miles (19 km) east to Fort Donelson. In the days following the surrender at Fort Henry, Union troops cut the railroad lines south of the fort, restricting the Confederates&#x27; lateral mobility to move reinforcements into the area to defend against the larger Union forces.

With the surrender of Fort Henry, the Confederates faced some difficult choices. Grant&#x27;s army now divided Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston&#x27;s two main forces: P.G.T. Beauregard at Columbus, Kentucky, with 12,000 men, and William J. Hardee at Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 22,000 men. Fort Donelson had only about 5,000 men. Union forces might attack Columbus; they might attack Fort Donelson and thereby threaten Nashville, Tennessee; or Grant and Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who was quartered in Louisville with 45,000 men, might attack Johnston head-on, with Grant following behind Buell. Johnston was apprehensive about the ease with which Union gunboats defeated Fort Henry (not comprehending that the rising waters of the Tennessee River played a crucial role by inundating the fort). He was more concerned about the threat from Buell than he was from Grant, and suspected the river operations might simply be a diversion.

Johnston decided upon a course of action that forfeited the initiative across most of his defensive line, tacitly admitting that the Confederate defensive strategy for Tennessee was a sham. On February 7, at a council of war held in the Covington Hotel at Bowling Green, he decided to abandon western Kentucky by withdrawing Beauregard from Columbus, evacuating Bowling Green, and moving his forces south of the Cumberland River at Nashville. Despite his misgivings about its defensibility, Johnston agreed to Beauregard&#x27;s advice that he should reinforce Fort Donelson with another 12,000 men, knowing that a defeat there would mean the inevitable loss of Middle Tennessee and the vital manufacturing and arsenal city of Nashville.

Johnston wanted to give command of Fort Donelson to Beauregard, who had performed ably at Bull Run, but the latter declined because of a throat ailment. Instead, the responsibility went to Brig. Gen. John B. Floyd, who had just arrived following an unsuccessful assignment under Robert E. Lee in western Virginia. Floyd was a wanted man in the North for alleged graft and secessionist activities when he was Secretary of War in the James Buchanan administration. Floyd&#x27;s background was political, not military, but he was nevertheless the senior brigadier general on the Cumberland River.

On the Union side, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, Grant&#x27;s superior as commander of the Department of the Missouri, was also apprehensive. Halleck had authorized Grant to capture Fort Henry, but now he felt that continuing to Fort Donelson was risky. Despite Grant&#x27;s success to date, Halleck had little confidence in him, considering Grant to be reckless. Halleck attempted to convince his own rival, Don Carlos Buell, to take command of the campaign to get his additional forces engaged. Despite Johnston&#x27;s high regard for Buell, the Union general was as passive as Grant was aggressive. Grant never suspected his superiors were considering relieving him, but he was well aware that any delay or reversal might be an opportunity for Halleck to lose his nerve and cancel the operation.

On February 6, Grant wired Halleck: &quot;Fort Henry is ours. ... I shall take and destroy Fort Donelson on the 8th and return to Fort Henry.&quot; This self-imposed deadline was overly optimistic due to three factors: miserable road conditions on the twelve-mile march to Donelson, the need for troops to carry supplies away from the rising flood waters (by February 8, Fort Henry was completely submerged), and the damage that had been sustained by Foote&#x27;s Western Gunboat Flotilla in the artillery duel at Fort Henry. If Grant had been able to move quickly, he might have taken Fort Donelson on February 8. Early in the morning of February 11, Grant held a council of war in which all of his generals supported his plans for an attack on Fort Donelson, with the exception of Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand, who had some reservations. This council in early 1862 was the last one that Grant held for the remainder of the Civil War.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===


Grant&#x27;s Union Army of the Tennessee of the District of Cairo consisted of three divisions, commanded by Brig. Gens. McClernand, C.F. Smith, and Lew Wallace. (At the start of the attack on Fort Donelson, Wallace was a brigade commander in reserve at Fort Henry, but was summoned on February 14 and charged with assembling a new division that included reinforcements arriving by steamship, including Charles Cruft&#x27;s brigade on loan from Buell.) Two regiments of cavalry and eight batteries of artillery supported the infantry divisions. Altogether, the Union forces numbered nearly 25,000 men, although at the start of the battle, only 15,000 were available.

The Western Gunboat Flotilla under Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote consisted of four ironclad gunboats (flagship USS &quot;St. Louis&quot;, USS &quot;Carondelet&quot;, USS &quot;Louisville&quot;, and USS &quot;Pittsburg&quot;) and three timberclad (wooden) gunboats (USS &quot;Conestoga&quot;, USS &quot;Tyler&quot;, and USS &quot;Lexington&quot;). USS &quot;Essex&quot; and had been damaged at Fort Henry and were being repaired.

===Confederate===


Floyd&#x27;s Confederate force of approximately 17,089 men consisted of three divisions (Army of Central Kentucky), garrison troops, and attached cavalry. The three divisions were commanded by Floyd (replaced by Colonel Gabriel C. Wharton when Floyd took command of the entire force) and Brig. Gens. Bushrod Johnson and Simon Bolivar Buckner. During the battle, Johnson, the engineering officer who briefly commanded Fort Donelson in late January, was effectively superseded by Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow (Grant&#x27;s opponent at his first battle at Belmont). Pillow, who arrived at Fort Donelson on February 9, was displaced from overall command of the fort when the more-senior Floyd arrived. The garrison troops were commanded by Col. John W. Head and the cavalry by Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.

Fort Donelson was named for Brig. Gen. Daniel S. Donelson, who selected its site and began construction in 1861. It was considerably more formidable than Fort Henry. Fort Donelson rose about 100 feet (30 m) on approximately 100 acres of dry ground above the Cumberland River, which allowed for plunging fire against attacking gunboats, an advantage Fort Henry did not enjoy. The river batteries included twelve guns: ten 32-pounder smoothbore cannons, two 9-pounder smoothbore cannons, an 8-inch howitzer, a 6.5-inch rifle (128-pounder), and a 10-inch Columbiad. There were three miles (5 km) of trenches in a semicircle around the fort and the small town of Dover. The outer works were bounded by Hickman Creek to the west, Lick Creek to the east, and the Cumberland River to the north. These trenches, located on a commanding ridge and fronted by a dense abatis of cut trees and limbs stuck into the ground and pointing outward, were backed up by artillery and manned by Buckner and his Bowling Green troops on the right (with his flank anchored on Hickman Creek), and Johnson/Pillow on the left (with his flank near the Cumberland River). Facing the Confederates, from left to right, were Smith, Lew Wallace (who arrived on February 14), and McClernand. McClernand&#x27;s right flank, which faced Pillow, had insufficient men to reach overflowing Lick Creek, so it was left unanchored. Through the center of the Confederate line ran the marshy Indian Creek, this point defended primarily by artillery overlooking it on each side.

==Battle==
===Preliminary movements and attacks (February 12–13)===

On February 12, most of the Union troops departed Fort Henry, where they were waiting for the return of Union gunboats and the arrival of additional troops that would increase the Union forces to about 25,000 men. The Union forces proceeded about 5 miles (8 km) on the two main roads leading between the two forts. They were delayed most of the day by a cavalry screen commanded by Nathan Bedford Forrest. Forrest&#x27;s troops, sent out by Buckner, spotted a detachment from McClernand&#x27;s division and opened fire against them. A brief skirmish ensued until orders from Buckner arrived to fall back within the entrenchments. After this withdrawal of Forrest&#x27;s cavalry, the Union troops moved closer to the Confederate defense line while trying to cover any possible Confederate escape routes. McClernand&#x27;s division made up the right of Grant&#x27;s army with C.F. Smith&#x27;s division forming the left. USS &quot;Carondelet&quot; was the first gunboat to arrive up the river, and she promptly fired numerous shells into the fort, testing its defenses before retiring. Grant arrived on February 12 and established his headquarters near the left side of the front of the line, at the Widow Crisp&#x27;s house.

On February 11, Buckner relayed orders to Pillow from Floyd to release Floyd&#x27;s and Buckner&#x27;s troops to operate south of the river, near Cumberland City, where they would be able to attack the Union supply lines while keeping a clear path back to Nashville. However, this would leave the Confederate forces at Fort Donelson heavily outnumbered. Gen. Pillow left early on the morning of February 12 to argue these orders with Gen. Floyd himself leaving Buckner in charge of the fort. After hearing sounds of artillery fire, Pillow returned to Fort Donelson to resume command. After the events of the day, Buckner remained at Fort Donelson to command the Confederate right. With the arrival of Grant&#x27;s army, General Johnston ordered Floyd to take any troops remaining in Clarksville to aid in the defense of Fort Donelson.

On February 13, several small probing attacks were carried out against the Confederate defenses, essentially ignoring orders from Grant that no general engagement be provoked. On the Union left, C. F. Smith sent two of his four brigades (under Cols. Jacob Lauman and John Cook) to test the defenses along his front. The attack suffered light casualties and made no gains, but Smith was able to keep up a harassing fire throughout the night. On the right, McClernand also ordered an unauthorized attack. Two regiments of Col. William R. Morrison&#x27;s brigade, along with one regiment, the 48th Illinois, from Col. W.H.L. Wallace&#x27;s brigade, were ordered to seize a battery (&quot;Redan Number 2&quot;) that had been plaguing their position. Isham N. Haynie, colonel of the 48th Illinois, was senior in rank to Colonel Morrison. Although rightfully in command of two of the three regiments, Morrison volunteered to turn over command once the attack was under way; however, when the attack began, Morrison was wounded, eliminating any leadership ambiguity. For unknown reasons Haynie never fully took control and the attack was repulsed. Some wounded men caught between the lines burned to death in grass fires ignited by the artillery.
General Grant had Commander Henry Walke bring the &quot;Carondelet&quot; up the Cumberland River to create a diversion by opening fire on the fort. The Confederates responded with shots from their long-range guns and eventually hit the gunboat. Walke retreated several miles below the fort, but soon returned and continued shelling the water batteries. General McClernand, in the meantime, had been attempting to stretch his men toward the river but ran into difficulties with a Confederate battery of guns. McClernand ultimately decided that he did not have enough men to stretch all the way to the river, so Grant decided to call on more troops. He sent orders to General Wallace, who had been left behind at Fort Henry, to bring his men to Fort Donelson.

With Floyd&#x27;s arrival to take command of Fort Donelson, Pillow took over leading the Confederate left. Feeling overwhelmed, Floyd left most of the actual command to Pillow and Buckner. At the end of the day, there had been several skirmishes, but the positions of each side were essentially the same. The night progressed with both sides fighting the cold weather.

Although the weather had been mostly rainy up to this point in the campaign, a snowstorm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought temperatures down to 10–12 °F (−12 °C) and deposited 3 inches (8 cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.
===Reinforcements and naval battle (February 14)===

At 11:00 a.m. on February 14, Floyd held a council of war in his headquarters at the Dover Hotel. There was general agreement that Fort Donelson was probably untenable. General Pillow was designated to lead a breakout attempt, evacuate the fort, and march to Nashville. Troops were moved behind the lines and the assault readied, and they broke through Union lines, but Grant sent them back to Fort Donelson reeling. Pillow, normally quite aggressive in battle, was unnerved and announced that since their movement had been detected, the breakout was sent back.

On February 14, General Lew Wallace&#x27;s brigade arrived from Fort Henry around noon, and Foote&#x27;s flotilla arrived on the Cumberland River in mid-afternoon, bringing six gunboats and another 10,000 Union reinforcements on twelve transport ships. Wallace assembled these new troops into a third division of two brigades, under Cols. John M. Thayer and Charles Cruft, and occupied the center of the line facing the Confederate trenches. This provided sufficient troops to extend McClernand&#x27;s right flank to be anchored on Lick Creek, by moving Col. John McArthur&#x27;s brigade of Smith&#x27;s division from the reserve to a position from which they intended to plug the gap at dawn the next morning.
As soon as Foote arrived, Grant urged him to attack the fort&#x27;s river batteries. Although Foote was reluctant to proceed before adequate reconnaissance, he moved his gunboats close to the shore by 3:00 p.m. and opened fire, just as he had done at Fort Henry. The Confederate artillery pummeled the fleet with heavy cannon fire and the assault was over by 4:30 p.m. Foote was wounded (coincidentally in his foot). The wheelhouse of his flagship, USS &quot;St. Louis&quot;, was carried away, and she floated helplessly downriver. USS &quot;Louisville&quot; was also disabled, and the &quot;Pittsburg&quot; began to take on water. The damage to the fleet was significant and it retreated downriver. Of the 500 Confederate shots fired, &quot;St. Louis&quot; was hit 59 times, &quot;Carondelet&quot; 54, &quot;Louisville&quot; 36, and &quot;Pittsburg&quot; 20 times. Foote had miscalculated the assault. Historian Kendall Gott suggested that it would have been more prudent to stay as far downriver as possible, and use the fleet&#x27;s longer-range guns to reduce the fort. An alternative might have been to overrun the batteries, probably at night as would be done successfully in the 1863 Vicksburg Campaign. Once the Union fleet was past the fixed river batteries, Fort Donelson would have been defenseless.

Eight Union sailors were killed and 44 were wounded while the Confederates lost none. (Captain Joseph Dixon of the river batteries had been killed the previous day during &quot;Carondelet&quot;&#x27;s bombardment.) On land the well-armed Union soldiers surrounded the Confederates, while the Union boats, although damaged, still controlled the river. Grant realized that any success at Fort Donelson would have to be carried by the army without strong naval support, and he wired Halleck that he might have to resort to a siege.

===Breakout attempt (February 15)===

Despite their unexpected naval success, the Confederate generals were still skeptical about their chances in the fort and held another late-night council of war, where they decided to retry their aborted escape plan. At dawn on February 15, the Confederates launched an assault led by Pillow against McClernand&#x27;s division on the unprotected right flank of the Union line. The Union troops, unable to sleep in the cold weather, were not caught entirely by surprise, but Grant was. Not expecting a land assault from the Confederates, he was up before dawn and had headed off to visit Flag Officer Foote on his flagship downriver. Grant left orders that none of his generals was to initiate an engagement and no one was designated as second-in-command during his absence.

The Confederate plan was for Pillow to push McClernand away and take control of Wynn&#x27;s Ferry and Forge Roads, the main routes to Nashville. Buckner was to move his division across Wynn&#x27;s Ferry Road and act as rear guard for the remainder of the army as it withdrew from Fort Donelson and moved east. A lone regiment from Buckner&#x27;s division—the 30th Tennessee—was designated to stay in the trenches and prevent a Federal pursuit. The attack started well, and after two hours of heavy fighting, Pillow&#x27;s men pushed McClernand&#x27;s line back and opened the escape route. It was in this attack that Union troops in the West first heard the famous, unnerving rebel yell.

The attack was initially successful because of the inexperience and poor positioning of McClernand&#x27;s troops and a flanking attack from the Confederate cavalry under Forrest. The Union brigades of Cols. Richard Oglesby and John McArthur were hit hardest; they withdrew in a generally orderly manner to the rear for regrouping and resupply. Around 8:00 a.m. McClernand sent a message requesting assistance from Lew Wallace, but Wallace had no orders from Grant, who was still absent, to respond to an attack on a fellow officer and declined the initial request. Wallace, who was hesitant to disobey orders, sent an aide to Grant&#x27;s headquarters for further instructions. In the meantime, McClernand&#x27;s ammunition was running out, but his withdrawal was not yet a rout. (The army of former quartermaster Ulysses S. Grant had not yet learned to organize reserve ammunition and supplies near the frontline brigades.) A second messenger arrived at Wallace&#x27;s camp in tears, crying, &quot;Our right flank is turned! ... The whole army is in danger!&quot; This time Wallace sent a brigade, under Col. Charles Cruft, to aid McClernand. Cruft&#x27;s brigade was sent in to replace Oglesby&#x27;s and McArthur&#x27;s brigades, but when they realized they had run into Pillow&#x27;s Confederates and were being flanked, they too began to fall back.

Not everything was going well with the Confederate advance. By 9:30 a.m., as the lead Union brigades were falling back, Nathan Bedford Forrest urged Bushrod Johnson to launch an all-out attack on the disorganized troops. Johnson was too cautious to approve of a general assault, but he did agree to keep the infantry moving slowly forward. Two hours into the battle, Gen. Pillow realized that Buckner&#x27;s wing was not attacking alongside his. After a confrontation between the two generals, Buckner&#x27;s troops moved out and, combined with the right flank of Pillow&#x27;s wing, hit W. H. L. Wallace&#x27;s brigade. The Confederates took control of Forge Road and a key section of Wynn&#x27;s Ferry Road, opening a route to Nashville, but Buckner&#x27;s delay provided time for Lew Wallace&#x27;s men to reinforce McClernand&#x27;s retreating forces before they were completely routed. Despite Grant&#x27;s earlier orders, Wallace&#x27;s units moved to the right with Thayer&#x27;s brigade, giving McClernand&#x27;s men time to regroup and gather ammunition from Wallace&#x27;s supplies. The 68th Ohio was left behind to protect the rear.

The Confederate offensive ended around 12:30 p.m., when Wallace&#x27;s and Thayer&#x27;s Union troops formed a defensive line on a ridge astride Wynn&#x27;s Ferry Road. The Confederates assaulted them three times, but were unsuccessful and withdrew to a ridge away. Nevertheless, they had had a good morning. The Confederates had pushed the Union defenders back one to two miles (2–3 km) and had opened their escape route.

Grant, who was apparently unaware of the battle, was notified by an aide and returned to his troops in the early afternoon. Grant first visited C. F. Smith on the Union left, where Grant ordered the 8th Missouri and the 11th Indiana to the Union right, then rode over icy roads to find McClernand and Wallace. Grant was dismayed at the confusion and a lack of organized leadership. McClernand grumbled &quot;This army wants a head.&quot; Grant replied, &quot;It seems so. Gentlemen, the position on the right must be retaken.&quot;

True to his nature, Grant did not panic at the Confederate assault. As Grant rode back from the river, he heard the sounds of guns and sent word to Foote to begin a demonstration of naval gunfire, assuming that his troops would be demoralized and could use the encouragement. Grant observed that some of the Confederates (Buckner&#x27;s) were fighting with knapsacks filled with three days of rations, which implied to him that they were attempting to escape, not pressing for a combat victory. He told an aide, &quot;The one who attacks first now will be victorious. The enemy will have to be in a hurry if he gets ahead of me.&quot;

Despite the successful morning attack, access to an open escape route, and to the amazement of Floyd and Buckner, Pillow ordered his men back to their trenches by 1:30 p.m. Buckner confronted Pillow, and Floyd intended to countermand the order, but Pillow argued that his men needed to regroup and resupply before evacuating the fort. Pillow won the argument. Floyd also believed that C. F. Smith&#x27;s division was being heavily reinforced, so the entire Confederate force was ordered back inside the lines of Fort Donelson, giving up the ground they gained earlier that day.

Grant moved quickly to exploit the opening and told Smith, &quot;All has failed on our right—you must take Fort Donelson.&quot; Smith replied, &quot;I will do it.&quot; Smith formed his two remaining brigades to make an attack. Lauman&#x27;s brigade would be the main attack, spearheaded by Col. James Tuttle&#x27;s 2nd Iowa Infantry. Cook&#x27;s brigade would be in support to the right and rear and act as a feint to draw fire away from Lauman&#x27;s brigade. Smith&#x27;s two-brigade attack quickly seized the outer line of entrenchments on the Confederate right from the 30th Tennessee, commanded by Col. John W. Head, who had been left behind from Buckner&#x27;s division. Despite two hours of repeated counterattacks, the Confederates could not repel Smith from the captured earthworks. The Union was now poised to seize Fort Donelson and its river batteries when light returned the next morning.
In the meantime, on the Union right, Lew Wallace formed an attacking column with three brigades—one from his own division, one from McClernand&#x27;s, and one from Smith&#x27;s—to try to regain control of ground lost in the battle that morning. Wallace&#x27;s old brigade of Zouaves (11th Indiana and 8th Missouri), now commanded by Col. Morgan L. Smith, and others from McClernand&#x27;s and Wallace&#x27;s divisions were chosen to lead the attack. The brigades of Cruft (Wallace&#x27;s Division) and Leonard F. Ross (McClernand&#x27;s Division) were placed in support on the flanks. Wallace ordered the attack forward. Smith, the 8th Missouri, and the 11th Indiana advanced a short distance up the hill using Zouave tactics, where the men repeatedly rushed and then fell to the ground in a prone position. By 5:30 p.m. Wallace&#x27;s troops had succeeded in retaking the ground lost that morning, and by nightfall, the Confederate troops had been driven back to their original positions. Grant began plans to resume his assault in the morning, although neglecting to close the escape route that Pillow had opened.

John A. Logan was gravely injured on February 15. Soon after the victory at Donelson, he was promoted to brigadier general in the volunteers.

==Surrender (February 16)==
Nearly 1,000 soldiers on both sides had been killed, with about 3,000 wounded still on the field; some froze to death in the snowstorm, many Union soldiers having thrown away their blankets and coats.

Inexplicably, generals Floyd and Pillow were upbeat about the day&#x27;s performance and wired General Johnston at Nashville that they had won a great victory. General Simon Bolivar Buckner, however, argued that they were in a desperate position that was getting worse with the arrival of Union reinforcements. At their final council of war in the Dover Hotel at 1:30 a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, he could only hold for thirty minutes, and he estimated that the cost of defending the fort would be as high as a seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner&#x27;s position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult. Most of the river transports were currently transporting wounded men to Nashville and would not return in time to evacuate the command.

Floyd, who believed if he was captured, he would be indicted for corruption during his service as Secretary of War in President James Buchanan&#x27;s cabinet before the war, promptly turned over his command to Pillow, who also feared Northern reprisals. In turn, Pillow passed the command to Buckner, who agreed to remain behind and surrender the army. During the night, Pillow escaped by small boat across the Cumberland. Floyd left the next morning on the only steamer available, taking his two regiments of Virginia infantry. Disgusted at the show of cowardice, a furious Nathan Bedford Forrest announced, &quot;I did not come here to surrender my command.&quot; He stormed out of the meeting and led about seven hundred of his cavalrymen on their escape from the fort. Forrest&#x27;s horsemen rode toward Nashville through the shallow, icy waters of Lick Creek, encountering no enemy and confirming that many more could have escaped by the same route, if Buckner had not posted guards to prevent any such attempts.

On the morning of February 16, Buckner sent a note to Grant requesting a truce and asking for terms of surrender. The note first reached General Smith, who exclaimed, &quot;No terms to the damned Rebels!&quot; When the note reached Grant, Smith urged him to offer no terms. Buckner had hoped that Grant would offer generous terms because of their earlier friendship. (In 1854 Grant was removed from command at a U.S. Army post in California, allegedly because of alcoholism. Buckner, a fellow U.S. Army officer at that time, loaned Grant money to return home to Illinois after Grant had been forced to resign his commission.) To Buckner&#x27;s dismay, Grant showed no mercy towards men rebelling against the federal government. Grant&#x27;s brusque reply became one of the most famous quotes of the war, earning him the nickname of &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot;:


Grant was not bluffing. Smith was now in a good position to move on the fort, having captured the outer lines of its fortifications, and was under orders to launch an attack with the support of other divisions the following day. Grant believed his position allowed him to forego a planned siege and successfully storm the fort. Buckner responded to Grant&#x27;s demand:
Grant, who was courteous to Buckner following the surrender, offered to loan him money to see him through his impending imprisonment, but Buckner declined. The surrender was a personal humiliation for Buckner and a strategic defeat for the Confederacy, which lost more than 12,000 men, 48 artillery pieces, much of their equipment, and control of the Cumberland River, which led to the evacuation of Nashville. This was the first of three Confederate armies that Grant would capture during the war. (The second was John C. Pemberton&#x27;s at the Siege of Vicksburg and the third Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox). Buckner also turned over considerable military equipment and provisions, which Grant&#x27;s troops badly needed. More than 7,000 Confederate prisoners of war were eventually transported from Fort Donelson to Camp Douglas in Chicago, Camp Morton in Indianapolis, and other prison camps elsewhere in the North. Buckner was held as a prisoner at Fort Warren in Boston until he was exchanged in August 1862.

==Aftermath==
The casualties at Fort Donelson were heavy, primarily because of the large Confederate surrender. Union losses were 2,691 (507 killed, 1,976 wounded, 208 captured/missing), Confederate 13,846 (327 killed, 1,127 wounded, 12,392 captured/missing).

Cannons were fired and church bells rung throughout the North at the news. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;Chicago reeled mad with joy.&quot; The capture of Forts Henry and Donelson were the first significant Union victories in the war and opened two great rivers to invasion in the heartland of the South. Grant was promoted to major general of volunteers, second in seniority only to Henry W. Halleck in the West. After newspapers reported that Grant had won the battle with a cigar clamped in his teeth, he was inundated with cigars sent from his many admirers. Before that he&#x27;d been only a light smoker, but after finding that he couldn&#x27;t give them all away, took to smoking them, which probably contributed to his later death from throat cancer. Grant had written in his memoirs that if all Union troops in the west were unified under a single commander to capitalize on the victory at Fort Donelson, the fighting in the western theaters of the civil war would&#x27;ve been closed quickly. Close to a third of all of Albert Sidney Johnston&#x27;s forces were now prisoners. Grant had captured more soldiers than all previous American generals combined, and Johnston was thereby deprived of more than twelve thousand soldiers who might have provided a decisive advantage at the impending Battle of Shiloh in less than two months time. The rest of Johnston&#x27;s forces were 200 miles (320 km) apart, between Nashville and Columbus, with Grant&#x27;s army between them. Grant&#x27;s forces also controlled nearby rivers and railroads. General Buell&#x27;s army threatened Nashville, while John Pope&#x27;s troops threatened Columbus. Johnston evacuated Nashville on February 23, surrendering this important industrial center to the Union and making it the first Confederate state capital to fall. Columbus was evacuated on March 2. Most of Tennessee fell under Union control, as did all of Kentucky, although both were subject to invasion and periodic Confederate raiding. 

==Battlefield preservation==
The site of the battle has been preserved by the National Park Service as Fort Donelson National Battlefield. Through November 2021, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners in battlefield land preservation have acquired and preserved of the battlefield, most of which has been conveyed to the park service and incorporated into the park.

<text>The Cessna T-37 Tweet (designated Model 318 by Cessna) is a small, economical twin-engine jet trainer aircraft. It was flown for decades as a primary trainer of the United States Air Force (USAF) as well as in the air forces of several other nations.

The T-37 was developed in response to the launch of the &quot;Trainer Experimental (TX)&quot; program for the United States Air Force (USAF) in early 1952. On 12 October 1954, the prototype XT-37 performed its maiden flight. While the first prototype was lost during spin tests, features to improve handling were installed upon subsequent prototypes, such as nose-mounted strakes and a heavily redesigned large tail unit, after which the USAF chose to order the aircraft into production as the &quot;T-37A&quot;. The service received the first production aircraft during June 1956.

In response to the T-37A being underpowered, the USAF ordered an improved version, the &quot;T-37B&quot;, that was powered by uprated J-69-T-25 engines and was also equipped with improved avionics. A total of 552 new-built T-37Bs were constructed through 1973; all surviving T-37As were eventually upgraded to the T-37B standard as well. The T-37 served as the USAF&#x27;s primary pilot training vehicle for over 50 years after its first flight. After completing initial training in the T-37, students progressed on to other advanced Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps or Allied trainers. A total of 1,269 T-37s were constructed prior to production ending in 1975. In 2009, the USAF withdrew its final T-37, having replaced the type with the newer turboprop-powered Beechcraft T-6 Texan II.

In addition to its use as a trainer, an armed T-37C variant was developed as a weapons trainer. A dedicated attack variant, the A-37 Dragonfly, was also developed by Cessna during the 1960s in response to a need for counter-insurgency aircraft (COIN) aircraft for the Vietnam War. Both the A-37 and T-37C were exported to various other countries, leading to their adoption by the air forces of several South American nations.

==Development==

===Origins===
The T-37 can be traced back to the spring of 1952 and the issuing of a request for proposals by the United States Air Force (USAF) for what would become the &quot;Trainer Experimental (TX)&quot; program. The request called for a lightweight twin-seat basic trainer that would be suitable for introducing USAF cadets to jet aircraft. More specifically, the aircraft had to be simple to operate, easy to maintain, structurally strong, possess favourable low-speed handling qualities, be relatively safe while performing high altitude maneuvers, adequate fuel capacity for at least two flight hours, a service ceiling of 30,000 feet, a maximum approach speed of 113 knots, a maximum all-up weight of 4,000 lbs, and the ability to land and take off in less than 4,000 feet.

Cessna was one of eight aircraft manufacturers to respond to the TX request, the company designed a twin-jet aircraft with side-by-side seating that it internally designated as the &quot;Model 318&quot;. The USAF favorably received Cessna&#x27;s submission, particularly the use of the side-by-side seating configuration as it let the student and instructor interact more closely than would be possible with tandem seating. In the spring of 1954, the USAF issued a contract to Cessna for the production of three prototypes of the Model 318 along with a separate contract for a single static test aircraft. The aircraft was designated &quot;XT-37&quot; by the USAF. According to aviation author Kev Darling, the selection of Cessna was a surprising result as the company was only experienced with piston-engined aircraft at the time.
The XT-37 was an all-metal aircraft with a semi-monocoque fuselage. It was an aerodynamically clean aircraft, so much so that a speedbrake was fitted behind the nosewheel doors that would be deployed to increase drag when the aircraft was landing as well as in other phases of flight. Since the relatively short landing gear placed the engine&#x27;s air intakes close to the ground, screens pivoted over the intakes from underneath when the landing gear was extended to prevent foreign object damage. The wide track and a steerable nosewheel enabled it to be relatively easy to handle on the ground while the short landing gear avoided the need for access ladders and service stands. For simplicity of maintenance, the fuselage featured in excess of 100 access panels and doors; an experienced ground crew could change an engine in about half an hour.

The XT-37 was fitted with a pair of Continental-Teledyne J69-T-9 turbojet engines, which were French Turbomeca Marboré engines produced under license, each being capable of generating up to 920 lbf (4.1 kN) of thrust. These engines were equipped with thrust attenuators that permitted them to remain spooled-up (i.e. rotating at speeds above idle) during landing approach, permitting shorter landings while still allowing the aircraft to easily make another go-around in case something went wrong. The empty weight of the XT-37 was .

The XT-37 had a low, straight wing while the engines buried in the wing roots, a clamshell-type canopy hinged to open vertically to the rear, a control layout similar to that of contemporary operational USAF aircraft, ejection seats, and tricycle landing gear with a wide track of 14 ft (4.3 m). Many of the aircraft&#x27;s components were designed and built internally by Cessna; relatively few external contractors were involved in the production.

On 12 October 1954, the XT-37 performed its maiden flight. Flight testing revealed the XT-37 to have a maximum speed of at altitude and a range of . Furthermore, it possessed a service ceiling of ; however, due to the cockpit being unpressurized, it was limited to an operational ceiling of by USAF regulations.

The initial prototype crashed during spin tests. To improve handling, subsequent prototypes were equipped with new aerodynamic features, such as lengthy strakes along the nose and an extensively redesigned and enlarged tail. On 3 May 1955, the third and final prototype took flight for the first time. After these modifications were implemented, the USAF found the aircraft to be acceptable to their needs and ordered it into production as the &quot;T-37A&quot;. Despite the changes, production aircraft remained tricky to correctly recover from a spin; it had a relatively complex recovery procedure in comparison to most aircraft. If fuel distribution was not managed correctly, a weight imbalance situation could be created that may lead to an unrecoverable stall.

===Production===

The production T-37A was similar to the XT-37 prototypes, differing only in only minor ways as to address problems revealed by flight testing. During September 1955, the first T-37A was completed, it made its first flight later that year. The USAF ultimately ordered 444 T-37As, the last of which was produced in 1959. During 1957, the US Army evaluated three T-37As for battlefield observation and other combat support roles, but eventually procured the Grumman OV-1 Mohawk for this purpose instead. Darling alleges that this outcome had been largely due to political factors, including the opposition of the USAF.

USAF officials reportedly liked the T-37A but often considered it to be underpowered; consequently, the service ordered an improved version, the &quot;T-37B&quot;. It was outfitted with uprated J-69-T-25 engines that provided roughly 10 percent more thrust as well as being more reliable. The new variant also featured improved avionics, fuel flow improvements, as well as various changes to reduce maintenance requirements. A total of 552 newly built T-37Bs was constructed through 1973. All surviving T-37As were progressively upgraded to the T-37B configuration as well, the rebuilding program being completed by July 1960.

Following a series of accidents caused by bird strikes between 1965 and 1970, all T-37s were later retrofitted with a new windshield made of Lexan polycarbonate plastic 0.5 in (12.7 mm) thick; this had sufficient strength to reliably withstand the impact of a bird at a relative speed of . While early examples of this new windshield suffered from distortion, this was rectified via production changes.

In 1962, Cessna suggested the T-37B as a replacement for the North American F-100 Super Sabre as the primary aircraft for the USAF aerobatic demonstration team, the Thunderbirds, but the USAF was satisfied with the F-100.
The T-37A and T-37B had no built-in armament and lacked any stores pylons for external armament. During 1961, Cessna began developing a modest enhancement of the T-37 for use as a weapons trainer. The new variant, the designated &quot;T-37C&quot;, was intended for export and could be used for light attack duties if required. The prototype T-37C was a modified T-37B; the principal changes made included strengthened wings and the addition of a stores pylon under each wing outboard of the main landing gear well. The T-37C could also be fitted with a reconnaissance camera mounted inside the fuselage. It could also be fitted with wingtip fuel tanks, each with a capacity of 65 US gal (245 L), that could be dropped in an emergency.

The primary armament of the T-37C was the General Electric &quot;multipurpose pod&quot; with a .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine gun with 200 rounds, two 70 mm (2.75 in) folding-fin rocket pods, and four practice bombs. Other stores, such as folding-fin rocket pods or Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, could be carried. A computing gunsight and gun camera were also added. The changes increased the weight of the T-37C by . As the engines were not upgraded, the changes caused a reduction in the aircraft&#x27;s top speed to 595 km/h (370 mph), though the wingtip tanks increased its maximum range to 1,770 km (1,100 mi).

Production of the T-37 slowed considerably during the early 1960s, although there was an uptake during the latter half of the decade, both to address attrition and an uptick in demand as the Vietnam War intensified. Around this time, the aircraft was authorised for supply to friendly overseas operators under the Military Aid for Assistance programme. Production of the T-37 was terminated in 1975. By this point, export sales of the type included 273 T-37Cs. This was on top of the 444 T-37As and 552 T-37Bs produced for both domestic and export customers for a total of 1,269 aircraft built.

===Further development and concept aircraft===

A dedicated attack variant of the T-37, referred to as the A-37 Dragonfly, was developed during the 1960s. This was largely in response to the Vietnam War, for which the USAF came to recognize the need for dedicated counter-insurgency aircraft (COIN) aircraft to engage with the ground forces of North Vietnam. Being derived from the T-37, the USAF had determined that an prospective COIN model would need to be able to carry a far greater payload, have more endurance, and possess better short-field performance. Specific alterations made included the adoption of strengthened wings, the use of larger wingtip fuel tanks of capacity, additional avionics suitable for battlefield communications, navigation, and targeting, toughened landing gear that were suitable for rough-field operation, and the fitting of a General Electric-supplied GAU-2B/A &quot;Minigun&quot; Gatling-style machine gun capable of a rate of fire of 3,000 rounds/minute and 1,500 rounds of ammunition that was installed in the aircraft&#x27;s nose along with an accompanying gunsight and gun camera. Three stores pylons were installed on each wing that were compatible with various munitions. This A-37 would not only be used in frontline combat in Vietnam, but was also exported to various other air forces, including several South American nations.

Cessna proposed a number of innovative variants of the T-37 that never went into production. In 1959, Cessna built a prototype of a light jet transport version of the T-37, designated the Cessna Model 407, which was stretched to accommodate a four-place pressurized cockpit with an automobile-type configuration. Only a wooden mockup of the Model 407 was constructed. The project was cancelled due to insufficient customer interest.

The company also proposed a similar four-place military light transport, the Model 405, with a large clamshell canopy, but it was never built.

In response to a United States Navy &quot;Tandem Navy Trainer&quot; (TNT) requirement, Cessna proposed a T-37 with a modified fuselage featuring a tandem cockpit. The Navy selected the North American T-2 Buckeye, instead.

Cessna proposed various other trainer derivatives for the US Navy and USAF, including a vertical takeoff version based on the TNT configuration and incorporating lift-jet pods in the wings, but none of them reached the prototype stage.

==Operational history==
During June 1956, deliveries of the T-37A commenced to the USAF; the service began both Aviation Cadet and commissioned officer pilot training using the type during the following year. The first T-37B was delivered in 1959. Instructors and students typically considered the T-37A to be a pleasant aircraft to fly, handling relatively well, being agile and responsive, though it was definitely not overpowered. It was capable of all traditional aerobatic maneuvers. Students intentionally placed the aircraft into a spin as part of their pilot training.

The T-37A was very noisy even by the standards of jet aircraft. The intake of air into its small turbojets emitted a high-pitched shriek that led some to describe the trainer as the &quot;Screaming Mimi&quot;, the &quot;6,000 pound dog whistle&quot; or &quot;Converter&quot; (converts fuel and air into noise and smoke). The piercing whistle gave rise to the T-37&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Tweety Bird&quot;, which was regularly shortened to &quot;Tweet&quot;. The USAF expended a considerable amount of time and money on soundproofing buildings at bases where the T-37 was stationed while ear protection were mandatory for all personnel when near an operating aircraft.

By 1996, a total of 132 aircraft had been lost in Class A accidents and 75 fatalities had been incurred, the majority of which were attributed to pilot error. Common errors included inadvertently shutting down the engines via throttle mismanagement, use of the aircraft in cold weather conditions, and oil system issues.

During the late 1970s, amid rising tensions between Argentina and Chile over conflicting territorial claims, commonly referred to be as the Beagle conflict, the Chilean Air Force retrofitted their T-37s into an armed configuration near identical to that of the A-37. Similarly, the Colombian Air Force decided to reorient its T-37Cs from training to light attack duties during the early 1980s.

Over the decades, the USAF made several attempts to replace the T-37, such as the abortive Fairchild T-46, however it remained in service with the USAF into the twenty-first century. The T-37 was ultimately phased out in favor of the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II between 2001 and 2009. The T-6 is a turboprop aircraft that possesses more power, better fuel efficiency, and more modern avionics than the T-37. The final USAF student training sortie by a T-37B in the Air Education and Training Command took place on 17 June 2009. The last USAF operator of the T-37B, the 80th Flying Training Wing, flew the sortie from its home station at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas. The last T-37B was officially retired from active USAF service on 31 July 2009.

<text>The Hongdu JL-8 (Nanchang JL-8), also known as the Karakorum-8 or K-8 for short, is a two-seat intermediate jet trainer and light attack aircraft designed by China Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation and Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. The primary contractor is the Hongdu Aviation Industry Corporation.

==Development==
The JL-8 trainer was proposed as a joint cooperation effort between the governments of Pakistan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1986. The name was changed on the suggestion of Pakistan&#x27;s President Zia ul Haq to Karakoram-8 to represent the friendship between the two countries. Work on the design started in 1987 at Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Company (NAMC) at Nanchang, Jiangshi Province in South Central China. The Chinese chief designer of the aircraft was Shi Ping (), heading a team of over 100 Chinese Engineers, while Air Cdr Muhammad Younas Tbt (M), SI(M) was the chief designer from the Pakistani side leading a team of over 20 Pakistani engineers.

Initially, the aircraft was to have used many parts manufactured in the United States, including the Garrett TFE731 engine and several cockpit displays, and communication and avionics systems, but due to political developments and an embargo from the US at the end of the 1980s following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, other suppliers had to be used. The first prototype was built in 1989, with the first flight taking place on 21 November 1990, piloted by Chief Test Pilot Col Yang Yao (). Flight testing continued from 1991 to 1993 by a Flight Test Team consisting of four Chinese and two Pakistani pilots.

After four prototypes were built, production of a small batch of 24 aircraft was launched in 1992. The Chinese share out of these was 18, while the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) received six K-8s in 1994. In 1995, the PAF decided to order 75 more K-8s to gradually replace its fleet of Cessna T-37 Tweet basic trainers. In 2010, the number of K-8 aircraft in the PAF inventory was estimated to be around 40. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) received its first six JL-8 trainers in 1995 following additional upgrades. The Chinese model uses a Chinese-manufactured version of the Ukrainian Ivchenko AI-25 (DV-2) engine, designated WS-11. The PLAAF is anticipated to continue adding the JL-8 trainer to its fleet to replace its obsolete trainers, such as the Chengdu JJ-5. In 2008, the number of JL-8s in PLAAF inventory was estimated to be over 120 aircraft.

Other countries have shown interest in the trainer, and it now also serves in the air forces of Egypt, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. While the type primarily serves as a basic and advanced trainer, it can also be used in the close air support or even air combat role when appropriately armed.

The export-variant K-8 Karakorum Basic Common Advanced Jet Trainer is co-produced by China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corporation (CATIC) for export markets other than Pakistan, while later aircraft for Pakistan have been built by the Aircraft Manufacturing Factory (AMF), Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. The latest export variant is the K-8P version, which is operated by the PAF. The K-8P has an advanced avionics package of integrated head-up display (HUD), multi-function displays (MFDs) and comes equipped with MFD-integrated GPS and ILS/TACAN systems. It also has hardpoints for carrying a variety of training and operational bombs up to 250 kg, pod-mounted 23 mm cannon, and PL-5 / 7 /AIM-9 P launchers. In September 2011, NAMC produced another 12 K-8Ps for an undisclosed foreign client.

In 2008 Venezuela announced the purchase of 18 K-8 aircraft. The K-8 has been marketed by China to the air forces of the Philippines , and to Indonesia, as a replacement for Indonesia&#x27;s BAE Hawk jet trainers. In 2009, the Bolivian government approved a deal to purchase 6 K-8P aircraft for use in anti-drug operations. In 2010 the total number of K-8 aircraft produced in all variants was estimated to be more than 500, with a continual production rate of approximately 24 aircraft per year.

==Design==
The JL-8 / K-8 has a multi-role capability for training and, with little modification, can also be used for airfield defense. The aircraft is supposed to be as cost-effective as possible, with a short turn-around time and low maintenance requirements. The JL-8 for the domestic Chinese market and its export variants, K-8E and K-8P, have different powerplants and avionics.

===Airframe and flight control system===
A low-wing monoplane design primarily constructed of aluminum alloys, the JL-8 / K-8 airframe structure is designed for an 8,000 flight hour service life.

The landing gear is of tricycle configuration, with hydraulically operated wheel brakes and nose-wheel steering.

The flight control system operates a set of conventional flight control surfaces with a rigid push-rod transmission system, which itself is electrically or hydraulically operated. The aileron control system, of irreversible servo-control type, is composed of a hydraulic booster, an artificial-feel device, a feel trim actuator and a rigid push-rod transmission mechanism. The elevator and rudder control systems are of reversible push-rod type.

===Cockpit and avionics===
The JL-8 / K-8 cockpit arrangement is designed to be as close to that of a combat aircraft as possible. A transparent plastic canopy covering both cockpits, which are arranged in a tandem seating position, is supposed to give a good all-round field of view.

A Rockwell Collins Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) is fitted, with multi-function displays (MFDs) in the front and rear cockpits showing information to the pilots. The emergency cockpit escape system is made up of two Martin-Baker MK-10L rocket-assisted ejection seats which are zero-zero capable, meaning they can be used safely at zero altitude and zero speed. Although JL-8 is designed to have limited capability to deliver air-to-ground weapons, the first rocket attack practice was only completed in May 2011.

Ultra high frequency (UHF) and very high frequency (VHF) radio communication systems are present, along with a Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) and automatic direction finder (ADF). An instrument landing system (ILS) is also available. These systems can be tailored to meet the requirements of the customer.

A strap-on Environmental control system (ECS) from AlliedSignal provides air conditioning to the cockpit. It is capable of operating when the aircraft is on the ground, under ambient temperatures of -40 to +52 °C, as well as in the air.

===Propulsion and fuel system===
The JL-8, for the Chinese domestic market, was originally powered by the Ukrainian Ivchenko-Progress AI-25TLK turbofan jet engine with 16.9 kN of thrust, but this has been replaced by the WS-11, the Chinese-manufactured version of the AI-25TLK. Export variants (K-8P, K-8E) use the lower-thrust (15.6 kN) Honeywell TFE731-2A-2A modular turbofan, which has digital electronic engine control (DEEC), provided the US government approves sale of the engine to the customer.

A hydro-mechanical fuel control system delivers fuel to the engine. The aircraft&#x27;s fuel system consists of the fuel tanks and the fuel supply/transfer, vent/pressurization, fuel quantity measuring/indicating, fuel refueling and fuel drain subsystems. The total fuel is contained in two fuselage bladder-type rubber tanks and a wing integral tank of 1720 lb. The capacity of each drop tank is 250 litres.

==Operational history==
The K-8 took part in its first aerial display in 1993 at the Singapore Air Show and since then has participated at Air Shows at numerous places including Dubai, Paris, Farnborough, Bangkok, Zhuhai etc. It was shown to the Pakistani public for the first time on 23 March 1994 at the Pakistan Day Parade. It became part of the Sherdils (Lion Hearts) aerobatics team of the Pakistan Air Force in 2009 and carried out its first public display on 6 April 2010. K-8 replaced the team&#x27;s previous T-37 Tweet aircraft.

===Myanmar===
In late December 2012 and early January 2013, during the Kachin conflict, K-8s of the Myanmar Air Force were used to strike Kachin Independence Army positions in the north of the country. On 30 June 2023 a K-8 W was destroyed while attacking opposition groups. On 11 November 2023 KNDF and People Defense Forces shot down a K8W at Loikaw, Karenni State with a 0.5 machine gun and it crashed into Than Daung Township in Karen State.

==Accidents and incidents==

<doc id="377606" wikidata="Q1378776" url="?curid=377606" title="Music of Ireland">
<text>Irish music is music that has been created in various genres on the island of Ireland.

The indigenous music of the island is termed Irish traditional music (or Irish folk music). It has remained vibrant through the 20th and into the 21st century, despite globalising cultural forces. In spite of emigration and mass exposure to music from Britain and the United States, Ireland&#x27;s traditional music has kept many of its elements and has itself influenced other forms of music, such as country and roots music in the United States, which in turn have had some influence on modern rock music. Irish folk music has occasionally been fused with punk rock, electronic rock and other genres. Some of these fusion artists have attained mainstream success, at home and abroad.

In art music, Ireland has a history reaching back to Gregorian chants in the Middle Ages, choral and harp music of the Renaissance, court music of the Baroque and early Classical period, as well as many Romantic, late Romantic and twentieth-century modernist music. It is still a vibrant genre with many composers and ensembles writing and performing avant-garde art music in the classical tradition.

On a smaller scale, Ireland has also produced many jazz musicians of note, particularly after the 1950s.

==Early Irish music==

By the High and Late Medieval Era, the Irish annals were listing native musicians, such as the following:

* &quot;921BC: Cú Congalta, priest of Lann-Leire, the Tethra (i. e. the singer or orator) for voice, personal form and knowledge, died.&quot;
* &quot;1011: Connmhach Ua Tomhrair, priest and chief singer of Cluain-mic-Nois, died.&quot;
* &quot;1168: Amhlaeibh Mac Innaighneorach, chief ollamh of Ireland in harp-playing, died.&quot;
* &quot;1226: Aed mac Donn Ó Sochlachain, erenagh of Cong, a man eminent for chanting and for the right tuning of harps and for having made an instrument for himself which none had made before, distinguished also in every art such as poetry, engraving and writing and in every skilled occupation, died.&quot;
* &quot;1269: Aed Ó Finn, master of music and minstrelsy, died.&quot;
* &quot;1329: Maol Ruanaidh Cam Ó Cearbhaill, tiompanist, murdered during the Braganstown Massacre in County Louth.&quot;
* &quot;1330: Mael Sechlainn Mac Carmaic, a general entertainer, died.&quot;
* &quot;1343: Donnchad Clereach Ó Maol Braonáin, a choral canon of Elphin, was killed by an arrow.&quot;
* &quot;1357: Donn Shléibhe Mac Cerbaill, an accomplished musician ... died.&quot;
* &quot;1360: Gilla na Naem Ó Conmaigh, music ollamh of Thomond ... died.&quot;
* &quot;1361. Magraith Ó Fionnachta, Chief Musician and Tiompanist to the Síol Muireadaigh, died.&quot;
* &quot;1364: Bran Ó Brain, a skilful tympanist ... died.&quot;
* &quot;1369: John Mac Egan, and Gilbert Ó Bardan, two accomplished young harpers of Conmaicne, died.&quot;
* &quot;1469: Ruaidrí mac Donnchad Ó Dálaigh, the most musical-handed harpist in all Ireland.&quot;
* &quot;1490: Diarmait MacCairbre, harper, was executed.&quot;
* &quot;1553: Tadhg, son of Ruaidhri Ó Comhdhain, i.e. the ollamh of Éire and Alba in music, died.&quot;
* &quot;1561: Naisse mac Cithruadh, drowned on Lough Gill.&quot;
* &quot;1589. Daighre Ó Duibhgeannáin, a most affable, musical man, died.&quot;

===Modern interpretation===
Early Irish poetry and song has been translated into modern Irish and English by notable Irish poets, song collectors and musicians. The 6th century hymn &quot;Rop tú mo baile&quot; by Dallán Forgaill for example, was published in 1905 in English by Mary Elizabeth Byrne, and is widely known as &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot;. &quot;The Blackbird of Belfast Lough&quot; (; ) has been notably translated by poets such as Seamus Heaney, Ciaran Carson and Frank O&#x27;Connor. Notable recordings of modern interpretations of early Irish music include Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin&#x27;s &quot;Songs of the Scribe&quot;, various music albums by choral group Anúna, and the recordings of Caitríona O&#x27;Leary with Dúlra and the eX Ensemble.

==Early Irish musicians abroad==
Some musicians were acclaimed in places beyond Ireland. Cú Chuimne (died 747) lived much of his adult life in Gaelic Scotland, and composed at least one hymn. Foillan, who was alive in the seventh century, travelled through much of Britain and France; around 653 at the request of Saint Gertrude of Brabant, taught psalmody to her nuns at Nievelle. Tuotilo (c.850–c. 915), who lived in Italy and Germany, was noted both as a musician and a composer.

Helias of Cologne (died 1040), is held to be the first to introduce Roman chant to Cologne. His contemporary, Aaron Scotus (died 18 November 1052) was an acclaimed composer of Gregorian chant in Germany.

Donell Dubh Ó Cathail (c. 1560s-c.1660), was not only musician of Viscount Buttevant, but, with his uncle Donell Óge Ó Cathail, harper to Elizabeth I.

==Early modern times==
Up to the seventeenth century, harp musicians were patronised by the aristocracy in Ireland. This tradition died out in the eighteenth century with the collapse of Gaelic Ireland. Turlough Carolan (1670–1738) is the best known of those harpists, and over 200 of his compositions are known. Some of his pieces use elements of contemporary baroque music, but his music has entered the tradition and is played by many folk musicians today. Edward Bunting collected some of the last-known Irish harp tunes at the Belfast Harp Festival in 1792. Other important collectors of Irish music include Francis O&#x27;Neill and George Petrie.

Other notable Irish musicians of this era included Cearbhall Óg Ó Dálaigh (fl. c. 1630); Piaras Feiritéar (1600?–1653); William Connellan (fl. mid-17th century) and his brother, Thomas Connellan (c. 1640/1645–1698), composers; Dominic Ó Mongain (alive 18th century); Donnchadh Ó Hámsaigh (1695–1807); poet and songwriter Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin (1748–1782); Arthur O&#x27;Neill (fl. 1792); Patrick Byrne (c.1794–1863); world-renowned piper Tarlach Mac Suibhne (c. 1831–1916); poet and songwriter Colm de Bhailís (1796–1906).

==Traditional music==

Irish traditional music includes many kinds of songs, including drinking songs, ballads and laments, sung unaccompanied or with accompaniment by a variety of instruments. Traditional dance music includes reels (), hornpipes and jigs (the common double jig is in time). The polka arrived at the start of the nineteenth century, spread by itinerant dancing masters and mercenary soldiers, returning from Europe. Set dancing may have arrived in the eighteenth century. Later imported dance-signatures include the mazurka and the highlands (a sort of Irished version of the Scottish strathspey).

The Irish fiddle was said by one nationalist researcher to have been played in Ireland since the 8th century, although this has never been proved by texts or artifacts. The bagpipes have a long history of being associated with Ireland Great Irish warpipes were once commonly used in Ireland especially in battle as far back as the 15th century.

A revival of Irish traditional music took place around the turn of the 20th century. The button accordion and the concertina were becoming common. Irish stepdance was performed at céilís, organised competitions and at some country houses where local and itinerant musicians were welcome. Irish dancing was supported by the educational system and patriotic organisations. An older style of singing called &quot;sean-nós&quot; (&quot;in the old style&quot;), which is a form of traditional Irish singing was still found, mainly for very poetic songs in the Irish language.

From 1820 to 1920 over 4,400,000 Irish emigrated to the US, creating an Irish diaspora in Philadelphia, Chicago (see Francis O&#x27;Neill), Boston, New York and other cities. O&#x27;Neill made the first recordings of Irish music on Edison wax cylinders. Later, Irish musicians who were successful in the USA made commercial recordings which found their way around the world and re-invigorated musical styles back in the homeland. For example, American-based fiddlers like Michael Coleman, James Morrison and Paddy Killoran did much to popularise Irish music in the 1920s and 1930s, while Ed Reavy composed over a hundred tunes that have since entered the tradition in both Ireland and the diaspora.
After a lull in the 1940s and 1950s, when (except for Céilidh bands) traditional music was at a low ebb, Seán Ó Riada&#x27;s Ceoltóirí Chualann, The Chieftains, Tom Lenihan, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, The Irish Rovers, The Dubliners, Ryan&#x27;s Fancy and Sweeney&#x27;s Men were in large part responsible for a second wave of revitalisation of Irish folk music in the 1960s. Several of these were featured in the 2010 TV movie &quot;My Music: When Irish Eyes are Smiling&quot;. Sean O&#x27;Riada in particular was singled out as a force who did much for Irish music, through programming on Radio Éireann in the late 1940s through the 1960s. He worked to promote and encourage the performing of traditional Irish music, and his work as a promoter and performer led directly to the formation of the Chieftains. His work inspired the likes of Planxty, The Bothy Band and Clannad in the 70s. Later came such bands as Stockton&#x27;s Wing, De Dannan, Altan, Arcady, Dervish and Patrick Street, along with a wealth of individual performers.

More and more people play Irish music and new bands emerge every year such as Téada, Gráda, Dervish, and Lúnasa.

==Classical music in Ireland==

There is evidence of music in the &quot;classical&quot; tradition since the early 15th century when a polyphonic choir was established at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, and &quot;city musicians&quot; were employed in the major cities and towns, who performed on festive occasions. In the 18th century, Dublin was known as the &quot;Second City&quot; of the British Isles, with an active musical life culminating in, among other events, the first performance of Handel&#x27;s famous oratorio &quot;Messiah&quot;. The ballad opera trend, caused by the success of the Beggar&#x27;s Opera, has left noticeable traces in Ireland, with many works that influenced the genre in England and on the continent, by musicians such as Charles Coffey and Kane O&#x27;Hara.

===Composers of note===
Apart from the harper-composers of the 16th century, composers in the 16th and 17th century usually came from a Protestant Anglo-Irish background, as due to the discrimination of Catholics no formal musical education was available to them. Composers were often associated with either Dublin Castle or one of the Dublin cathedrals (St Patrick&#x27;s and Christ Church). These include immigrants in the 18th century such as Johann Sigismund Cousser, Matthew Dubourg, and Tommaso Giordani. Thomas Roseingrave and his brother Ralph were prominent Irish baroque composers. Among the next generation of composers were the Cork-born Philip Cogan (1750–1833), a prominent composer of piano music including concertos, John Andrew Stevenson (1761–1833), who is best known for his publications of &quot;Irish Melodies&quot; with poet Thomas Moore, who also wrote operas, religious music, catches, glees, odes, and songs. In the early 19th century Irish-born composers dominated English-language opera in England and Ireland, including Charles Thomas Carter (c.1735–1804), Michael Kelly (1762–1826), Thomas Simpson Cooke (1782–1848), William Henry Kearns (1794–1846), Joseph Augustine Wade (1801–1845) and, later in the century, Michael W. Balfe (1808–1870) and William Vincent Wallace (1812–1865). John Field (1782–1837) has been credited with the creation of the Nocturne form, which influenced Frédéric Chopin. John William Glover (1815–1899), Joseph Robinson (1815–1898) and Robert Prescott Stewart (1825–1894) kept Irish classical music in Dublin alive in the 19th century, while mid-19th-century emigrants include George William Torrance and George Alexander Osborne. Charles Villiers Stanford (1852–1924) and Hamilton Harty (1879–1941) were among the last emigrants in Irish music, combining a late romantic musical language with Irish folklorism. Their contemporary in Ireland was the Italian immigrant Michele Esposito (1855–1929), a figure of seminal importance in Irish music who arrived in Ireland in 1882. The years after Irish independence were a difficult period in which composers tried to find an identifiable Irish voice in an anti-British climate, which included ressentiments against classical music as such. The development of Irish broadcasting in the 1920s and the gradual enlargement of the Radio Éireann Orchestra in the late 1930s improved the situation. Important composers in these years were John F. Larchet (1884–1967), Ina Boyle (1889–1967), Arthur Duff (1899–1956), Aloys Fleischmann (1910–1992), Frederick May (1911–1985), Joan Trimble (1915–2000), and Brian Boydell (1917–2000). The middle decades of the 20th century were also shaped by A.J. Potter (1918–1980), Gerard Victory (1921–1995), James Wilson (1922–2005), Seán Ó Riada (1931–1971), John Kinsella (1932–2021), and Seóirse Bodley (1933–2023). Prominent names among the older generation of composers in Ireland today are Frank Corcoran (b. 1944), Eric Sweeney (1948–2020), John Buckley (b. 1951), Gerald Barry (b. 1952), Raymond Deane (b. 1953), Gearóid Ó Deaghaidh (b. 1954), Patrick Cassidy (b. 1956), and Fergus Johnston (b. 1959) (see also List of Irish classical composers).

===Performers of note===
Performers of note in classical music include Catherine Hayes (1818–1861), Ireland&#x27;s first great international &quot;prima donna&quot; and the first Irish woman to perform at La Scala in Milan; tenor Barton McGuckin (1852–1913), a much-demanded singer in the late 19th century; tenor Joseph O&#x27;Mara (1864–1927), a very prominent singer around the turn of the century; tenor John McCormack (1884–1945), the most celebrated tenor of his day; opera singer Margaret Burke-Sheridan (1889–1958); pianist Charles Lynch (1906–1984); tenor Josef Locke (1917–1999) achieved global success and was the subject of the 1991 film &quot;Hear My Song&quot;; the concert flautist Sir James Galway and pianist Barry Douglas. Douglas achieved fame in 1986 by claiming the International Tchaikovsky Competition gold medal. Mezzo-sopranos Bernadette Greevy and Ann Murray have also had success internationally.

===Choral music===

Choral music has been practised in Ireland for centuries, initially at the larger churches such as Christ Church Cathedral, St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, and St Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral, as well as the University of Dublin Choral Society (founded in 1837).

Founded and directed by composer Michael McGlynn in 1987, Anúna contributed significantly to raising the profile of choral music, particularly through their contributions to Riverdance which they were a part of from 1994 to 1996. They were nominated for a Classical Brit Award in the UK and appeared at the BBC Proms series in the Royal Albert Hall in 1999. In 2012 they featured as the voices of Hell in the video game Diablo III. In February 2018 the group won the Outstanding Ensemble category of the Annual Game Music Awards 2017 for their contributions to the video game Xenoblade Chronicles 2.

The Chamber Choir Ireland, formerly National Chamber Choir of Ireland, is principally funded by the Arts Council of Ireland. Their artistic director is Paul Hillier. The choir has produced a number of CDs with international (including Irish) repertoire. There are many semi-professional choirs in Ireland at local level, too. Many perform and compete at the annual Cork International Choral Festival (since 1954).

===Opera===
Although Ireland had no purpose-built opera house for a long time, opera has been performed in Ireland since the 17th century. In the 18th century, Ireland was a centre for ballad opera and created important works that helped to develop the genre in the direction of operetta, with works by Charles Coffey and Kane O&#x27;Hara. Nationally identifiable Irish operas have been written by immigrants such as Tommaso Giordani and Johann Bernhard Logier as well as by native composers such as John Andrew Stevenson and Thomas Simpson Cooke, continued in the 19th century with works by John William Glover and Paul McSwiney. Michael William Balfe and Vincent Wallace were the most prominent representatives of mid-19th-century English-language operas.

The Celtic Renaissance after 1900 created works such as &quot;Muirgheis&quot; (1903) by Thomas O&#x27;Brien Butler, &quot;Connla of the Golden Hair&quot; (1903) by William Harvey Pélissier, &quot;Eithne&quot; (1909) by Robert O&#x27;Dwyer, and &quot;The Tinker and the Fairy&quot; (1910) by Michele Esposito. &quot;Muirgheis&quot; and &quot;Eithne&quot; have librettos in Irish, as have a number of works by Geoffrey Molyneux Palmer and several 1940s and &#x27;50s works by Éamonn Ó Gallchobhair. Most of the Irish operas written since the 1960s have a contemporary international outlook, with important works by Gerard Victory, James Wilson, Raymond Deane, Gerald Barry, and a number of young composers since the turn of the century.

There have been subsequent attempts to revive the Irish-language tradition in opera. A brother-sister team previewed sections of the opera &quot;Clann Tuireann&quot; publicly, and in 2017 musician John Spillane told the Evening Echo that he was then working on a Gaelic opera to be titled &quot;Legends of the Lough&quot;.

Wexford Festival Opera is a major international festival that takes place every October and November.

==Popular music==
===Early popular performers===
Performers of popular music began appearing as early as the late 1940s; Delia Murphy popularised Irish folk songs that she recorded for HMV in 1949; Margaret Barry is also credited with bringing traditional songs to the fore; Donegal&#x27;s Bridie Gallagher shot to fame in 1956 and is considered &#x27;Ireland&#x27;s first international pop star&#x27;; Belfast-born singer Ruby Murray achieved unprecedented chart success in the UK in the mid-1950s; Dublin native Carmel Quinn emigrated to the US and became a regular singer on Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts and appeared frequently on other TV variety shows in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. The Bachelors were an all-male harmony group from Dublin who had hits in the UK, Europe, US, Australia and Russia; Mary O&#x27;Hara was a soprano and harpist who was successful on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1950s and early 1960s; Waterford crooner Val Doonican had a string of UK hits and presented his own TV show on the BBC from 1965 to 1986.

===Showbands in Ireland===

Irish Showbands were a major force in Irish popular music, particularly in rural areas, for twenty years from the mid-1950s. The showband played in dance halls and was loosely based on the six or seven piece Dixieland dance band. The basic showband repertoire included standard dance numbers, cover versions of pop music hits, ranging from rock and roll, country and western to jazz standards. Key to the showband&#x27;s success was the ability to learn and perform songs currently in the record charts. They sometimes played Irish traditional or Céilidh music and a few included self-composed songs.

===Country and Irish===
With the rise in popularity of American country music, a new subgenre developed in Ireland known as &#x27;Country and Irish&#x27;. It was formed by mixing American Country music with Irish influences, incorporating Irish folk music. This often resulted in traditional Irish songs being sung in a country music style. It is especially popular in the rural Midlands and North-West of the country. It also remains popular among Irish emigrants in Great Britain. Big Tom and The Mainliners were the first major contenders in this genre, having crossed over from the showband era of the 1960s. Other major artists were Philomena Begley and Margo, the latter even being bestowed the unofficial title of &quot;Queen of Country &amp; Irish&quot;. The most successful performer in the genre today is Daniel O&#x27;Donnell, who has garnered success in the UK, US and Australia. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s frequent singing partner Mary Duff has also had success in this genre and most recently County Carlow native Derek Ryan has enjoyed Irish chart hits doing this type of music.

===Fusion===
Traditional music played a part in Irish popular music later in the century, with Clannad, Van Morrison, Hothouse Flowers and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor using traditional elements in popular songs. Enya achieved international success with New Age/Celtic fusions. The Afro-Celt Sound System achieved fame adding West African influences and electronic dance rhythms in the 1990s while bands such as Kíla fuse traditional Irish with rock and world music representing the Irish tradition at world music festivals across Europe and America. The most notable fusion band in Ireland was Horslips, who combined Irish themes and music with heavy rock. The Shamrock Wings is a Colombian band that fuses Irish music with Caribbean rhythms.

&quot;Riverdance&quot; is a musical and dancing interval act which originally starred Michael Flatley and Jean Butler and featuring the choir Anúna. It was performed during the Eurovision Song Contest 1994 as &quot;Riverdance&quot;. Popular reaction to the act was so immense that an entire musical revue was built around the act.

===Pop/Rock===

The 1960s saw the emergence of major Irish rock bands and artists, such as Them, Van Morrison, Emmet Spiceland, Eire Apparent, Skid Row, Taste, Rory Gallagher, Dr. Strangely Strange, Thin Lizzy, Gary Moore, Mellow Candle.

In 1970 Dana put Ireland on the pop music map by winning the Eurovision Song Contest with her song All Kinds of Everything. She went to number one in the UK and all over Europe and paved the way for many Irish artists. Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan went to the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic in 1972 with a string of hits, and the all-sister line-up of The Nolans gained international chart success in the late 1970s. Chris de Burgh achieved international acclaim with his 1986 hit &quot;Lady in Red&quot;.

Some groups who formed during the emergence of punk rock in the mid-late 1970s included U2, Virgin Prunes, The Boomtown Rats, The Undertones, Aslan, Gavin Friday, and Stiff Little Fingers. Later in the 80s and into the 90s, Irish punk fractured into new styles of alternative rock, which included That Petrol Emotion, In Tua Nua, Fatima Mansions, My Bloody Valentine and Ash. In the 1990s, pop and rock bands like The Corrs, B*Witched, Boyzone, Westlife and The Cranberries emerged. In the same decade, Ireland also contributed a subgenre of folk metal known as Celtic metal with exponents of the genre including Cruachan, Primordial, Geasa, and Waylander.

<text>Elijah Parish Lovejoy (November 9, 1802 – November 7, 1837) was an American Presbyterian minister, journalist, newspaper editor, and abolitionist. After his murder by a mob, he became a martyr to the abolitionist cause opposing slavery in the United States. He was also hailed as a defender of free speech and freedom of the press.

Lovejoy was born in New England and graduated from what is today Colby College. Unsatisfied with a teaching career, he was drawn to journalism and decided to &#x27;go west&#x27;. In 1827, he reached St. Louis, Missouri. Under the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Missouri entered the United States as a slave state. Lovejoy edited a newspaper but returned east for a time to study for the ministry at Princeton University. On his return to St. Louis, he founded the &quot;St. Louis Observer&quot;, in which he became increasingly critical of slavery and the powerful interests protecting slavery. Facing threats and violent attacks, Lovejoy decided to move across the river to Alton in Illinois, a free state. However, Alton was also tied to the Mississippi River economy, easily reachable by anti-Lovejoy Missourians, and badly split over abolitionism.

In Alton, Lovejoy was fatally shot during an attack by a pro-slavery mob. The mob was seeking to destroy a warehouse owned by Winthrop Sargent Gilman and Benjamin Godfrey, which held Lovejoy&#x27;s printing press and abolitionist materials. According to John Quincy Adams, the murder &quot;[gave] a shock as of an earthquake throughout this country.&quot; The &quot;Boston Recorder&quot; wrote that &quot;these events called forth from every part of the land &#x27;a burst of indignation which has not had its parallel in this country since the Battle of Lexington.&#x27;&quot; When informed about the murder, John Brown said publicly: &quot;Here, before God, in the presence of these witnesses, from this time, I consecrate my life to the destruction of slavery.&quot; Lovejoy is often seen as a martyr to the abolitionist cause and to a free press. The Lovejoy Monument was erected in Alton in 1897.

==Early life and education==
Elijah Parish Lovejoy was born at his paternal grandparents&#x27; frontier farmhouse near Albion, Maine (then part of Massachusetts), the eldest of nine children of Elizabeth (Pattee) Lovejoy and Daniel Lovejoy. Lovejoy&#x27;s father was a Congregational preacher and farmer, and his mother was a homemaker and a devout Christian. Daniel Lovejoy named his son in honor of his close friend and mentor, Elijah Parish, a minister who was also involved in politics. Due to his own lack of education, the father encouraged his sons – Elijah, Daniel, Joseph Cammett, Owen, and John – to become educated. Elijah was taught to read the Bible and other religious texts by his mother at an early age.

After completing early studies in public schools, Lovejoy attended the private Academy at Monmouth and China Academy. When sufficiently proficient in Latin and mathematics, he enrolled at Waterville College (now Colby College) as a sophomore in 1823. Lovejoy received financial support from minister Benjamin Tappan to continue his studies there. Based on faculty recommendations, from 1824 until his graduation in 1826, he also served as headmaster of Colby&#x27;s associated high school, the Latin School (later known as the Coburn Classical Institute). In September 1826, Lovejoy graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Waterville, and was class valedictorian.

=== Journey westward ===
During the winter and spring, he taught at China Academy in Maine. Dissatisfied with teaching, Lovejoy considered moving to the American South or westward to the Northwest Territory. His former teachers at Waterville College advised him that he would best serve God in the West (now considered the American Midwest).

In May 1827, he went to Boston to earn money for his journey, having settled on the free state of Illinois as his destination. Unsuccessful at finding work, he started for Illinois by foot. He stopped in New York City in mid-June to try to find work. He eventually landed a position with the &quot;Saturday Evening Gazette&quot; as a newspaper subscription peddler. For nearly five weeks, he worked to sell subscriptions.

Struggling with his finances, he wrote to Jeremiah Chaplin, president of Waterville College, explaining his situation. Chaplin sent the money that his former student needed. Before embarking on his journey westward, Lovejoy wrote a poem which later seemed to prophesy his death:

==Career in Missouri==
In 1827, Lovejoy arrived in St. Louis, Missouri, a major port in a slave state that shared its longest border with the free state of Illinois. Although it had a large slave market, St. Louis identified itself less with the plantation South and more as the &quot;gateway to the West&quot; and the American &quot;frontier.&quot;

Lovejoy initially ran a private school in St. Louis with a friend, which they modeled after academies in the East. Lovejoy&#x27;s interest in teaching waned, however, when local editors began publishing his poems in their newspapers.

=== &quot;St. Louis Times&quot; ===
In 1829, Lovejoy became a co-editor with T. J. Miller of the &quot;St. Louis Times&quot;, which promoted the candidacy of Henry Clay for president of the United States. Working at the &quot;Times&quot; introduced him to like-minded community leaders, many of whom were members of the American Colonization Society. They supported sending freed American blacks to Africa, considering it a kind of &quot;repatriation.&quot; Opponents of the ACS including Frederick Douglass noted most African Americans had been native-born for generations and considered their future to be in the U.S. Among Lovejoy&#x27;s new acquaintances were prominent St. Louis attorneys and slaveholders such as Edward Bates (later U.S. Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln); Hamilton R. Gamble, later Chief Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court; and his brother Archibald Gamble.

Lovejoy occasionally hired slaves who were leased out by owners, to work with him at the paper. Among them was William Wells Brown, who later recounted his experience in a memoir. Brown described Lovejoy as &quot;a very good man, and decidedly the best master that I had ever had. I am chiefly indebted to him, and to my employment in the printing office, for what little learning I obtained while in slavery.&quot;
=== Theological training ===
Lovejoy struggled with his interest in religion, often writing to his parents about his sinfulness and rebellion against God. He attended revival meetings in 1831 led by William S. Potts, pastor of First Presbyterian Church, that rekindled his interest in religion for a time. However, Lovejoy admitted to his parents that &quot;gradually these feelings all left me, and I returned to the world a more hardened sinner than ever.&quot;

A year later, Lovejoy found the call to God he had been yearning for. In 1832, influenced by Christian revivalist meetings led by abolitionist David Nelson, he joined the First Presbyterian Church and decided to become a preacher. He sold his interest in the &quot;Times,&quot; and returned East to study at Princeton Theological Seminary. While he was at Princeton, Lovejoy debated the question of slavery with an abolitionist named Bradford. Although Lovejoy had opposed abolitionism during the debate, after returning to St. Louis he would write to Bradford repeatedly asking him to write articles for his newspaper.

After graduation, he went to Philadelphia, where he became an ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church on April 18, 1833.

===&quot;St. Louis Observer&quot;===
In 1833, a group of Protestants in St. Louis offered to finance a religious newspaper if Lovejoy would agree to return and edit it. Lovejoy accepted and on November 22, 1833, he published the first issue of the &quot;St. Louis Observer&quot;. His editorials criticized both the Catholic Church and slavery. By 1830, sixty percent of the population of St. Louis was Catholic, and the proprietors of the &quot;Observer&quot; tasked Lovejoy with countering the increasing influence of Catholicism.

From the fall of 1833 to the summer 1836, Lovejoy regularly published articles criticizing the Catholic Church and church doctrine. Some were written by Lovejoy, while others were contributed by other authors. Initially, he criticized Catholic beliefs such as transubstantiation, clerical celibacy, and the influence of Catholicism on foreign governments. He also argued that &quot;Popery&quot; undermined the fundamental principles of American democracy. Local Catholics and clergy were offended by these attacks and regularly responded in articles of their own in &quot;The Shepherd of the Times&quot;, a Catholic newspaper funded by Bishop Joseph Rosati.

In 1834, the &quot;St. Louis Observer&quot; began to increase its coverage of slavery, the most controversial issue of the day. At first, Lovejoy resisted calling himself an abolitionist, because he disliked the negative connotations associating abolitionism with social unrest. Even as he expressed antislavery views, he claimed to be an &quot;emancipationist&quot; rather than an &quot;abolitionist.&quot; In the spring of 1835, the &quot;Missouri Republican&quot; advocated the gradual emancipation of slaves in Missouri, and Lovejoy voiced his support through the &quot;Observer&quot;. Lovejoy urged antislavery groups in Missouri to push for the issue to be addressed during a proposed state constitutional convention. To their dismay, the editors of both newspapers soon found that their &quot;moderate&quot; proposal to end slavery gradually could not be discussed without igniting a polarizing political debate.

Over time, Lovejoy became bolder and more outspoken about his antislavery views, advocating the outright emancipation of all slaves on religious and moral grounds. Lovejoy condemned slavery and &quot;implored all Christians who owned slaves to recognize that slaves were human beings who possessed a soul,&quot; and famously wrote:Slavery, as it exists among us ... is demonstrably an evil. In every community where it exists, it presses like a nightmare on the body politic. Or, like the vampire, it slowly and imperceptibly sucks away the life-blood of society, leaving it faint and disheartened to stagger along the road of improvement.

=== Threats of violence ===
Lovejoy&#x27;s views on slavery began to incite complaints and threats. Pro-slavery proponents condemned anti-slavery coverage which appeared in newspapers, stating that it was against &quot;the vital interests of the slaveholding states.&quot; Lovejoy was threatened to be tarred and feathered if he continued to publish anti-slavery content.

By October 1835, there were rumors of mob action against &quot;The Observer.&quot; A group of prominent St. Louisans, including many of Lovejoy&#x27;s friends, wrote a letter pleading with him to cease discussion of slavery in the newspaper. Lovejoy was away from the city at this time, and the publishers declared that no further articles on slavery would be published during his absence. They said that when he returned, he would follow a more rigorous editorial policy. Lovejoy responded by expressing disagreement with the publishers&#x27; policy. As tensions over slavery escalated in St. Louis, Lovejoy would not back down from his convictions; he sensed that he would become a martyr for the cause. He was asked to resign as editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, to which he agreed. After the newspaper&#x27;s owners released &quot;The Observer&quot; property to the moneylender who held the mortgage, the new owners asked Lovejoy to stay on as editor.

==== Lynching of Francis McIntosh ====

Lovejoy and &quot;The Observer&quot; continued to be embroiled in controversy. In April 1836, Francis McIntosh, a free man of color and boatman, was arrested by two policemen. En route to the jail, McIntosh grabbed a knife and stabbed both men. One was killed and the other seriously injured. McIntosh attempted to escape, but was caught by a white mob, who tied him up and burned him to death. Some of the mob were brought before a grand jury to face charges. The presiding judge, Judge Luke Lawless, refused to convict anyone; he said the crime was a spontaneous mob action without any specific people to prosecute. The judge made remarks suggesting that abolitionists, including Lovejoy and &quot;The Observer,&quot; had incited McIntosh into stabbing the policemen.

==Marriage and family==
Lovejoy also served as an evangelist preacher. He traveled a circuit across the state, during which he met Celia Ann French of St. Charles, located on the Missouri River west of St. Louis, now a suburb of the city. She was the daughter of Thomas French, a lawyer who came to St. Charles in the 1820s. The couple were married on March 4, 1835. Their son Edward P. Lovejoy was born in 1836. Their second child was born after Elijah&#x27;s death and died as an infant. In a letter to his mother, Elijah had written about Celia:My dear wife is a perfect heroine... never has she by a single word attempted to turn me from the scene of warfare and danger – never has she whispered a feeling of discontent at the hardships to which she has been subjected in consequence of her marriage to me, and those have been neither few nor small.

==Move to Illinois==
In the summer of 1836, Lovejoy attended the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh and met several followers of abolitionist Theodore Weld. At the assembly, Lovejoy was frustrated by the church&#x27;s hesitation to fully support petitions for abolition and drafted a protest submitted to church leadership. By this time, he had fully embraced the label of &quot;abolitionist.&quot;

In the face of all the negative publicity and two break-ins in May 1836, Lovejoy decided to move &quot;The Observer&quot; across the Mississippi River to Alton, Illinois. At the time, Alton was a large and prosperous river port (many times larger than the frontier town of Chicago). Although Illinois was a free state, Alton was also a center for slave catchers and pro-slavery forces active in the southern area. Many refugee slaves crossed the Mississippi River from Missouri, and attempted to reach freedom on the underground railroad. Among Alton&#x27;s residents were pro-slavery Southerners who thought Alton should not become a haven for escaped slaves.

On July 21, 1836, Lovejoy published a scathing editorial in St. Louis criticizing the way that the Missouri court&#x27;s Judge Luke Lawless had handled the murder trial of Francis McIntosh. Arguing that the judge&#x27;s actions appeared to condone the murder, he wrote that Lawless was &quot;a Papist; and in his charge we see the cloven foot of Jesuitism.&quot; He also announced that his next issue would be printed in Alton. Before he could move the press, an angry mob broke into &quot;The Observer&quot; office and vandalized it. Only Alderman and future mayor Bryan Mullanphy attempted to stop the crime, and no policemen or city officials intervened. Lovejoy packed what remained of the office for shipment to Alton. The printing press sat on the riverbank, unguarded, overnight; vandals destroyed it and threw the remains into the Mississippi River.

=== &quot;Alton Observer&quot; ===
Lovejoy served as pastor at Upper Alton Presbyterian Church (now College Avenue Presbyterian Church). In 1837, he started the &quot;Alton Observer&quot;, also an abolitionist, Presbyterian paper. Lovejoy&#x27;s views on slavery became more extreme, and he called for a convention to discuss forming an Illinois state chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society, established in Philadelphia in 1833.

Many residents of Alton began to question whether they should continue to allow Lovejoy to print in their town. After an economic crisis in March 1837, Alton citizens wondered if Lovejoy&#x27;s views were contributing to hard times. They felt Southern states, or even the city of St. Louis, might not want to do business with their town if they continued to harbor such an outspoken abolitionist.

Lovejoy held the Illinois Antislavery Congress at the Presbyterian church in Upper Alton on October 26, 1837. Supporters were surprised to see two pro-slavery advocates in the crowd, John Hogan and Illinois Attorney General Usher F. Linder. The Lovejoy supporters were not happy to have his enemies at the convention, but relented as the meeting was open to all parties.

On November 2, 1837, Lovejoy responded to threats in a speech, saying:
===Mob attack and death===

Lovejoy had acquired a fourth press and hid it in a warehouse owned by Winthrop Sargent Gilman and Gilford, major grocers in the area. A mob, said by &quot;Appleton&#x27;s&quot; to be composed mostly of Missourians, attacked the building on the evening of November 6, 1837. Pro-slavery partisans approached Gilman&#x27;s warehouse, where Lovejoy had hidden his printing press. The conflict continued. According to the &quot;Alton Observer&quot;, the mob fired shots into the warehouse. When Lovejoy and his men returned fire, they hit several people in the crowd, killing a man named Bishop. After the attacking party had apparently withdrawn, Lovejoy opened the door and was instantly struck by five bullets, dying in a few minutes.

Jon Meacham in his book &quot;And There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle&quot; notes that Lovejoy was murdered on November 7, 1837, after he helped William Lloyd Garrison found an Illinois chapter of Garrison&#x27;s Anti-Slavery Society.
Elijah Lovejoy was buried in Alton Cemetery; his grave was unmarked to prevent vandalism. The ceremony was kept small. In 1864, Thomas Dimmock &quot;reclaimed from oblivion&quot; Lovejoy&#x27;s grave. Dimmock had &quot;succeeded in establishing the location of the grave... in a roadway where vehicles were passing over it... Mr. Dimmock had the bones disinterred and... laid in a new grave where they would be free from trespass.&quot; He also arranged for a gravestone and helped found a committee to create a monument to the editor. Dimmock was principal orator at the dedication of a later monument erected in 1897 to commemorate Lovejoy.
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said of the grave marking and association to fund a monument:

==Alton riot trial==

Francis B. Murdoch, the district attorney of Alton, prosecuted charges of riot related to both assailants and defenders of the warehouse in January 1838, on Wednesday and Friday of the same week. He called the Illinois Attorney General, Usher F. Linder, to assist him.

Murdoch (with Linder) first prosecuted Gilman, owner of the warehouse, and eleven other defenders of the new press and building. They were indicted on two charges related to the riot at a trial opening January 16, 1838, for &quot;unlawful defence&quot;, so defined and charged because it was &quot;violently and tumultuously done.&quot; Gilman moved to be tried separately; his counsel said he needed to be able to show his lack of criminal intent. The court agreed on the condition that the other eleven defendants would be tried together. Although the proceedings lasted until 10 p.m. that night, in the case of Gilman, the jury returned after ten minutes to declare him &quot;Not Guilty.&quot; The next morning the &quot;City Attorney entered a &#x27;Nolle Prosequi&#x27; as to the other eleven defendants&quot;, effectively dismissing the charges against them.

A new jury was called to hear the case against the assailants of the warehouse. The attackers allegedly responsible for destruction of the warehouse and Lovejoy&#x27;s death were tried beginning January 19, 1838. Concluding it was not possible to assign responsibility among the several suspects and others not indicted, the jury gave a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;. The jury foreman had been identified as a member of the mob and was wounded in the attack. The presiding judge doubled as a witness to the proceedings. These conflicts of interest are believed to have contributed to the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict.

==Aftermath and legacy==
After Lovejoy was killed, there was a dramatic increase in the number of people in the North and the West who joined anti-slavery societies, which formed beginning in the 1830s. Partly because he was a clergyman, there was outrage about his death. It became a catalyst for other pro- and anti-slavery events, like John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, that culminated with the American Civil War.

Lovejoy was considered a martyr by the abolition movement. In his name, his brother Owen Lovejoy became the leader of the Illinois abolitionists. Owen and his brother Joseph wrote a memoir about Elijah, which was published in 1838 by the Anti-Slavery Society in New York and distributed widely among abolitionists in the nation. With his killing symbolic of the rising tensions within the country, Lovejoy is called the &quot;first casualty of the Civil War.&quot;

Abraham Lincoln referred to Lovejoy&#x27;s murder in his Lyceum address in January 1838. About Lovejoy, Lincoln said, &quot;Let every man remember that to violate the law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his own, and his children’s liberty… Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother…in short let it become the political religion of the nation…&quot;

John Brown was inspired by Lovejoy&#x27;s death. At a church meeting the Sunday after Lovejoy&#x27;s murder, he vowed to commit his life to abolition. Two neighbors recalled that he announced: &quot;I pledge myself, with God&#x27;s help, that I devote my life to increasing hostility to slavery.&quot; A later recollection by his half-brother Edward Brown had a different formulation: &quot;Here, before God, in the presence of these witnesses, from this time, I consecrate my life to the destruction of slavery.&quot;

John Glanville Gill completed his Ph.D. at Harvard in 1946 on &quot;The Issues Involved in the Death of the Rev. Elijah P. Lovejoy, Alton, 1837&quot;. This thesis was adapted and published in 1958 as the first biography of Lovejoy, entitled &quot;Tide Without Turning: Elijah P. Lovejoy and Freedom of the Press&quot;.

<text>The Eurasian scops owl (Otus scops), also known as the European scops owl, common scops owl or just scops owl, is a small owl in the typical owl family Strigidae. Its breeding range extends from southern Europe eastwards to southern Siberia and the western Himalayas. It is migratory, wintering in Africa south of the Sahara.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian scops owl was formally described by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Linnaeus cited the 1599 description by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi, placed it with all the other owls in the genus &quot;Strix&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Strix scops&quot;. The Eurasian scops owl is now placed in the genus &quot;Otus&quot; that was introduced in 1769 by Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. The genus name is derived from the Latin &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;eared owl&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;scops&quot; is from the Ancient Greek word &quot;skōps&quot; for a little eared owl. The term is believed to be of Pre-Greek origin; folk etymology links it to σκώπτω (&quot;skṓptō&quot;, &quot;to mock&quot;) or σκέπτομαι (&quot;sképtomai&quot;, &quot;to examine&quot;).

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;O. s. scops&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – France and Italy to the Caucasus area
* &quot;O. s. mallorcae&quot; von Jordans, 1923 – Iberian Peninsula, Balearic Islands and northwest Africa
* &quot;O. s. cycladum&quot; (Tschusi, 1904) – southern Greece and Crete to southern Turkey, Syria and Jordan
* &quot;O. s. turanicus&quot; (Loudon, 1905) – Iraq to northwest Pakistan
* &quot;O. s. pulchellus&quot; (Pallas, 1771) – Kazakhstan to southern Siberia and western Himalayas

== Description ==
The Eurasian scops owl is in length with a wingspan of . This is somewhat smaller than the little owl (&quot;Athene noctua&quot;). It perches upright and shows small ear-tufts. The plumage is predominantly grey-brown in colour, with a paler face, underparts and shoulder line. This species has a strong direct flight on long narrow wings, reflecting its migratory habits.

The call is a deep whistle given by both sexes. It is similar to the call of midwife toads in the genus &quot;Alytes&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat==

This bird breeds in southern Europe eastwards into western and central Asia. It is migratory, wintering in southernmost Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. It was spotted in Newtown area near Kolkata for a brief period during October 2021. It was the first sighting in eastern India. It is rare any distance north of its breeding range, usually occurring as a spring overshoot. It is unlikely that this nocturnal owl would be found outside the breeding season when it is not calling.

== Behaviour ==
===Breeding===
Eurasian scops owls breed in open woodland, parks and gardens. The nest is usually a hole in a tree or in a wall, but can sometimes be an old nest of another species such as a crow. The clutch is usually 4 or 5 eggs. These are white and measure and weigh around . The eggs are incubated only by the female. They hatch after 24-25 days. The young are cared for and fed by both parents. They fledge when aged 21–29 days and become independent of their parents at 30–40 days of age.

===Diet===
It takes small prey such as insects and other invertebrates. It is largely nocturnal.

<text>Michael Henry Flanders (1 March 1922 – 14 April 1975) was an English actor, broadcaster, and writer and performer of comic songs. He is best known for his stage partnership with Donald Swann.

As a young man Flanders seemed to be heading for a successful acting career. He contracted polio in 1943 while serving in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve and for the rest of his life was reliant on a wheelchair. He made a career as a prolific broadcaster on radio and later television, and together with his old schoolfriend, the composer Donald Swann, he wrote successful songs in the late 1940s and early and mid-1950s for revues in the West End of London. In 1956 they themselves performed some of these songs, along with new songs, in a two-man revue, &quot;At the Drop of a Hat&quot;. This show, and its successor, &quot;At the Drop of Another Hat&quot;, ran with occasional short breaks from 1956 to 1967 and played in theatres throughout the British Isles, the US, Australia and elsewhere.

During and after the stage partnership with Swann, Flanders pursued a many-faceted career, performing on stage, screen, radio, concert platforms and recordings. He wrote opera librettos, a children&#x27;s book, a volume of poetry and the words of a cantata about Noah&#x27;s Ark.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Flanders was born in Hampstead, London, the third child and only son of Percy Henry Flanders and his wife, Rosa Laura (&quot;Laurie&quot;), daughter of Charles O&#x27;Beirne, of Hastings. His father had a variety of occupations, including actor and cinema manager. His mother was a professional violinist.

From 1936 to 1940 Flanders was a pupil at Westminster School, where his contemporaries included Peter Ustinov, Peter Brook, Tony Benn and Donald Swann. In his last term in 1940, he and Swann collaborated on a school revue called &quot;Go To It!&quot; From Westminster, Flanders went up to Christ Church, Oxford, to read History. There he acted and directed for the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Experimental Theatre Club. His roles included Brabantio in &quot;Othello&quot;, Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot; and Shawcross in Auden and Isherwood&#x27;s &quot;The Ascent of F6&quot;. He also wrote drama criticisms for the Oxford magazine &quot;Cherwell&quot;. In October 1941 he made his professional acting debut at the Oxford Playhouse as Valentine in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;. His biographer and Oxford contemporary Michael Meyer writes of Flanders in this period:
In 1942 Flanders applied to join the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, serving at first as an able seaman, and later commissioned as a sub-lieutenant. He survived unharmed a torpedo attack in 1942 on his ship, HMS &quot;Marne&quot;, but the following year he contracted poliomyelitis at sea and spent the next three years in hospitals. In 1946 he was discharged, but remained a wheelchair user for the rest of his life. He was deeply upset when the university authorities refused, because of his disabilities, to allow him back to resume his studies.

===Postwar===
Flanders returned to the family home in Hampstead Garden Suburb. He directed and produced plays with a local amateur theatre group and arranged small musical gatherings with other amateurs of music, including Gerard Hoffnung and Frank Hauser. A stage acting career being no longer possible, he found work as a radio broadcaster and wrote a few song lyrics. At the same time, Swann began composing music for revues. He recalled in 1974, We wrote our first song in the summer of 1948. I&#x27;d gone over to Michael&#x27;s home near Hampstead Heath to see if he could think of some words for a tune I&#x27;d written … &quot;It all sounds a bit like Gilbert and Sullivan, don&#x27;t you think? … It must be terribly boring in the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Company, having to do everything exactly as it always has been done – &quot;Idea!&quot;&quot;&quot; The resulting trio, &quot;In the D&#x27;Oyly Cart&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;], for three disgruntled Savoyards, was accepted by the producer Laurier Lister for his new show &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;. The revue and the trio were highly successful, and Lister commissioned further work from the pair for his next production, &quot;Penny Plain&quot; (1951). Among their contributions to the latter were &quot;Prehistoric Complaint&quot;, a solo for Max Adrian, &quot;dressed in bits of fur as a sort of mis-fit caveman&quot;, and &quot;Surly Girls&quot;, with Adrian, Desmond Walter-Ellis and Jimmy Thompson as a trio of appalling St Trinian&#x27;s schoolgirls.
The Flanders and Swann numbers in the two shows worked so well that Lister invited the pair to write much of his next revue, &quot;Airs on a Shoestring&quot; (1953). Their topics ranged from economics and politics (&quot;There&#x27;s a Hole in My Budget&quot;) to a plaintive song about London&#x27;s last tram (&quot;Last of the Line&quot;) to a send-up of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s works to date (&quot;Guide to Britten&quot;). In the same year Flanders wrote the libretto for a short opera by Antony Hopkins, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. They followed this up the next year with &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;. Also in 1954 Flanders, in partnership with Kitty Black (1914–2006), translated Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Histoire du soldat&quot; for the Edinburgh Festival. The work played to capacity audiences in Edinburgh, and again in London at the Royal Festival Hall in 1956 with Flanders as the narrator, Sir Ralph Richardson as the Soldier and Peter Ustinov as the Devil. The translation has held its place as the standard English version into the 21st century.

During the 1950s, Flanders consolidated his career as a broadcaster, on radio, and later on television, in programmes ranging from sports commentary to poetry readings, and including a two-year stint as chairman of &quot;The Brains Trust&quot; after it moved from radio to television. He preferred performing to writing, and said that he wrote mainly &quot;to give myself something to perform.&quot;

===&quot;At the Drop of a Hat&quot;===

As established and successful songwriters Flanders and Swann were invited to lecture on their craft at Dartington International Summer School in 1956. Flanders found that his spoken introductions were as well received by the audience as were the songs themselves. He and Swann decided to give a show along similar lines in London. They took the New Lindsey Theatre for a limited three-week run; the New Lindsey, holding about 150 people, was situated outside the London West End theatre district. The show opened on 31 December 1956. The press notices were good, the box-office did excellent business, and the pair were offered a West End transfer. Swann recalled in 1977, &quot;We turned it down unanimously. It seemed to spell the end of Michael&#x27;s radio career (he had by that time done at least a thousand broadcasts) and the end of Swann as composer.&quot; After each had spent two or three sleepless nights worrying, they reconsidered; the show transferred to the Fortune Theatre in Covent Garden on 24 January 1957, where, according to &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;it took the audience by storm&quot;. The critic J. C. Trewin wrote, &quot;I feel that even [W. S.] Gilbert might have applauded the intricate neatness of their numbers. … I urge you to hear Mr Flanders as he explains the precise derivation of &#x27;Greensleeves&#x27;.&quot; The show ran for 808 performances at the Fortune, until 2 May 1959.

In August 1959 Flanders and Swann took the revue to the Edinburgh Festival. On 8 October they opened in New York at Broadway&#x27;s John Golden Theatre, playing there for 215 performances. In the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; Walter Kerr wrote, &quot;Whatever it is that runs through both these gentlemen&#x27;s veins it makes them lively, witty, literate, ingratiating, explosively funny and excellent company for a daffy and delightful evening&quot;. After closing on Broadway they toured the show through 12 cities in the US, one in Canada and three in Switzerland. During 1962 and 1963, they revived the production in Canada and toured the British Isles, appearing in 17 towns and cities. During the tour they continually added new songs and dropped old ones; by the time they returned to the West End in October 1963 the programme was so different from that given at their last London appearance more than four years earlier that the show had a new title: &quot;At the Drop of Another Hat&quot;.

===&quot;At the Drop of Another Hat&quot;===
The second show followed the pattern of the first, with songs and monologues linked by comment and introductions by Flanders. It opened on 2 October 1963 at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, a much larger house than the Fortune (with 900 seats to the Fortune&#x27;s 438). Once again the reviews were excellent. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; called the show &quot;an instant success&quot;; &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;a delicious entertainment … an inimitable evening&quot;:

The duo played at the Haymarket until 21 March 1964, and after a break they toured the show in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and southern England, before opening again in London, at the Globe Theatre in September 1965, playing there until February 1966. Finally, they toured the show in Canada and the US, concluding in a Broadway run at the Booth Theatre from 31 December 1966 to 9 April 1967.

The decision to stop playing the Hat shows was chiefly Swann&#x27;s, who felt they were impeding his range as a serious composer. The two remained friends and continued to collaborate from time to time.

Michael Flanders was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1972 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

===Other work===
During breaks in the schedule of the Hat shows, and after they had come to an end, Flanders performed on radio, television, stage, film and the concert platform. In 1962 he appeared at the Aldwych Theatre, London, as the Storyteller in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot;. In 1970 he starred in the revue &quot;Ten Years Hard&quot; by Peter Myers; his performance was praised, but the show was not, and it closed within a month. He acted in the films &quot;Doctor in Distress&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Raging Moon&quot; (1971).

Flanders continued to broadcast on radio and television. On BBC radio he was the anchorman of the &quot;Scrapbook&quot; and &quot;Battle for the Atlantic&quot; series, and he was a regular on the quiz shows &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; and &quot;Animal, Vegetable and Mineral&quot;. On television he presented the concert, opera and ballet series &quot;Gala Performance&quot;. He provided the storyteller&#x27;s voice on the British soundtrack of the &quot;Barbapapa&quot; animated cartoon series, and narrated many documentaries, including the 1969 BBC &quot;Royal Family&quot;.

As a writer, Flanders&#x27;s best-known work other than his revue lyrics is probably the text for the children&#x27;s cantata &quot;Captain Noah and His Floating Zoo&quot; with music by Joseph Horovitz, which won an Ivor Novello Award in 1976. He published a book of poems, &quot;Creatures Great and Small&quot;, in 1964, and a children&#x27;s book &quot;The Sayings and Doings of Nasrudin the Wise&quot; in 1974.

====Recordings====

Parlophone records made live recordings of both the Hat shows, and studio recordings of a collection of the songs about animals. Unreleased material, privately recorded or off-air, was later released on LP and CD.

For EMI Flanders recorded the narration of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Efrem Kurtz (1959). With Fenella Fielding he recorded Edith Sitwell&#x27;s &quot;Façade&quot; poems with Walton&#x27;s music played by the Academy of St Martin in the Fields conducted by Neville Marriner (1972). Flanders had long been fascinated by &quot;Façade&quot;: &quot;It is an extraordinarily difficult work – even an impossible one. There are times when you are just forced to babble, others when you are completely swamped by the orchestra. It really pushes you to the limits&quot;.

Flanders recorded as narrator in his and Antony Hopkins&#x27;s opera &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; (1954); as reader in &quot;Touches of Sweet Harmony – Music inspired by Shakespeare&quot; (1962); as the Dromios in &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; with John Neville as the Antipholuses (1963); and as reader of the whole of St Mark&#x27;s Gospel on a three LP set (1962). With the Michael Sammes singers he recorded &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;, which was issued as a single disc and as part of a compilation EP, with introductions by Flanders, &quot;The Christmas Story&quot;. He was the narrator on an EMI LP &quot;Elizabeth the Great&quot; (1963) celebrating Queen Elizabeth I, with Mary Morris as Elizabeth.

===Personal life===
On 31 December 1959, Flanders married Claudia Davis, daughter of the journalist Claud Cockburn and stepdaughter of Robert Gorham Davis, professor of English at Columbia University in New York. They had two daughters, both of whom became journalists: Laura and Stephanie.

Flanders was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1964 New Year&#x27;s Honours. He was an eloquent advocate of better access to theatres for people with disabilities, and later he interested himself in other campaigning issues. After his death, Claudia Flanders continued to promote the cause of accessibility for wheelchair users.

Flanders died suddenly on 14 April 1975, aged 53, of a ruptured intracranial berry aneurysm, while on holiday at Betws-y-Coed, Wales. His ashes were scattered in the grounds of Chiswick House in west London, a place where he had often liked to sit in the afternoon during the final years of his life.

===Commemoration===
On 30 June 2007 BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Archive Hour&quot; broadcast &quot;Flanders on Flanders&quot;, a documentary by Flanders&#x27;s daughter Stephanie about her father and his work. The Michael Flanders Centre, a 75-place day care centre in Acton, London, was founded in his honour by Claudia Flanders and others.

<text>The Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) () is the aerial warfare branch of the Bangladesh Armed Forces. The air force is primarily responsible for air defence of Bangladesh&#x27;s sovereign territory as well as providing air support to the Bangladesh Army and Bangladesh Navy. Furthermore, the BAF has a territorial role in providing tactical and strategic air transport and logistics capability for the country.

Since its establishment on 28 September 1971, the Bangladesh Air Force has been involved in various combat and humanitarian operations, from the Bangladesh Liberation War in which it was born, to support international efforts including United Nations peacekeeping missions. Operation Kilo Flight was a famous operation conducted by the Bangladesh Air Force during the Bangladesh Liberation War.

==History==
===Foundation===
The Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) was officially formed on 28 September 1971 during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and consisted of revolting Bengali officers and airmen who defected from the Pakistan Air Force at Dimapur Airport in the Indian state of Nagaland. It was launched formally by flying three repaired vintage aircraft on 8 October 1971. BAF&#x27;s initial personnel were around a 1,000 Bengali members of the Pakistan Air Force, who were stationed in East Pakistan at the outbreak of the war and who defected to the Bangladeshi side. At that time, the embryo of the BAF was formed with less than a hundred officers and around 900 airmen. These numbers were gradually strengthened by the slow but steady defection from among the around 3,000 Bengali officers and airmen stationed and grounded in West Pakistan. By the first week of December, a total of 700 Bengali officers and airmen had defected from the Western border. A significant number of BAF personnel participated in the Ground Warfare roles in the conflict. During the war, initially, officers of the BAF attached to the then Bangladesh Government were Chief Representative to Chakulia Guerrilla Training Camp Squadron Leader M. Hamidullah Khan, Group Captain A. K. Khandekar, DCOS Army(Liaison) later Sub-Sector Commander and as Commander - Sector 11, Flight Lieutenant Liaqat as Battalion Adjutant, Flying Officer Rouf, Flying Officer Ashraf and Flight Sergeant Shafiqullah as company commanders. Squadron Leader Sadruddin Hossain, Squadron Leader Wahidur Rahim, Squadron Leader Nurul Qader, Squadron Leader Shamsur Rahman and Squadron Leader Ataur Rahman as sub sector company commanders. Squadron Leader Khademul Bashar participated in the war as Commander-Sector 6.

Indian civilian authorities and the IAF donated 1 DC-3 Dakota (gifted by the Maharaja of Jodhpor), 1 Twin Otter plane, and 1 Alouette III helicopter for the new-born Bangladesh Air Force. The Bengali rank and file fixed up the World War II vintage runway at Dimapur Airport, then began rigging the aircraft for combat duty. The Dakota was modified to carry 500 pound bombs, but for technical reasons, it was only used to ferry Bangladesh government personnel. The Alouette III helicopter was rigged to fire 14 rockets from pylons attached to its side and had .303 Browning machine guns installed, in addition to having 1-inch (25 mm) steel plate welded to its floor for extra protection. The Twin Otter boasted 7 rockets under each of its wings and could deliver ten 25 pound bombs, which were rolled out of the aircraft by hand through a makeshift door. This tiny force was dubbed Kilo Flight, the first fighting formation of the nascent Bangladesh Air Force. Squadron Leader Sultan Mahmud was appointed as the commander of the &#x27;Kilo Flight&#x27;.

Bangladesh Air Force first went in action on 3 December 1971, at the start of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, and attacked the Chattogrambased oil tank depot and oil tank depot was totally destroyed by that air attack. The air attack was conducted by Capt. Akram Ahmed. The second Bangladesh Air Force attack was on 6 December 1971 at Moulvibazar Pakistani Army barracks under the command of Squadron Leader Sultan Mahmud, where Captain Shahabuddin Ahmed was co-pilot.

After the surrender of Pakistan, all personnel reported to Bangladesh Forces commander-in-chief, Col. M. A. G. Osmani. On 7 April 1972, the post of the chief of air staff went into effect by order of the President of Bangladesh. The combined command of Bangladesh Forces had been abolished with effect from 7 April 1972 and replaced by three separate commands for the three services with acting chiefs of staff. The Bangladesh Air Force gradually began to reoccupy the reform all the airbase structures throughout the country, HQ administrative buildings, fuel and weapons depots.

===After independence===
After independence, in November–December 1972, the BAF received a significant donation from the former USSR. Among the aircraft delivered were ten single-seat Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21MFs, two twin-seat Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21UMs, and twelve Mil Mi-8 utility helicopters. Later on, China also supplied some equipment.

Apart from the aircraft of Kilo Flight, which were donated by India, most Pakistan Air Force aircraft grounded in Dhaka due to runway cratering by the Indian Air Force during the liberation war, were sabotaged before surrender. Of these, four Canadair Sabres were also returned to service by Bangladeshi ground technicians in 1972. The Pakistan Air Force prior to 1971 had many Bengali pilots, air traffic controllers, technicians and administrative officers and the general Bengali representation in the Pakistan Air Force was around 15% (and 18% in the officer ranks) of the 25,000 odd manpower of the Pakistan Air Force in 1971, which although lower than their share in the population (50%) was much higher than the 6% numbers in the Army. Many of them distinguished themselves during the Bangladesh Liberation War, they provided the nascent Bangladesh Air Force with a good number of trained personnel. It had grown with the repatriation of the around 2,000 Air Force personnel from Pakistan in 1973 after the Simla Agreement.
In 1977, some personnel of Bangladesh Air Force, led by Sergeant Afsar, attempted to stage a coup, which resulted in the deaths of 11 air force officers. After the mutiny was put down by the then Provost marshal Wing Commander M. Hamidullah Khan, TJ, SH, BP, President Ziaur Rahman even considered disbanding the Bangladesh Air Force, in favour of an army aviation wing. However, this plan did not go ahead. President Ziaur Rahman placed Hamidullah in charge of Command and Communication Control at the old Parliamentary building, present day Prime Minister&#x27;s office. Hamidullah reorganized the Forces intelligence to directorate general level under the authority of the President. Hence DGFI was born.

Defence co-operation improved with Pakistan considerably under the government of Ziaur Rahman and the military regime of Hussain Muhammad Ershad in Bangladesh, which had grown more distant from its wartime ally India. Common concerns over India&#x27;s regional meddling have influenced strategic co-operation leading to a gift of several squadrons of refurbished Shenyang F-6 fighter aircraft from Pakistan to the Bangladesh Air Force in the late 1980s. Bangladesh bought 8 MiG-29s from Russia in 1999 under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

The Bangladesh Air Force Academy (BAFA) received &quot;National Colours&quot; in 2003 from the then-Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. The Recruits&#x27; Training School (RTS) was awarded with &quot;BAF Colours&quot; by ex-Chief of Air Staff (AVM Fakhrul Azam) in 2004. In 2017, the Bangladesh Air Force was awarded the Independence Day Award.

===COVID-19 pandemic operations===
The Bangladesh Air Force was active during the COVID-19 pandemic. The BAF provided emergency medivac for many critical COVID-19 patients with their helicopters. BAF also evacuated immigrants and migrant workers, and airlifted tons of relief materials for home and abroad with their C-130B and C-130J cargo aircraft.

===Forces Goal 2030===

The Bangladesh Air Force has an ambitious modernisation plan to be implemented in upcoming years under Forces Goal 2030. As per the goal, air force is to be a strong deterrent force to well protect the sky of Bangladesh. Plans are made to strengthen both air power and land based air defence capabilities. Since the formulation of the forces goal 2030, the BAF has developed in many folds.

The Bangladesh Air Force has set up an advanced training unit named &quot;105 Advance Jet Training Unit&quot; which is a dedicated fighter pilot training unit of BAF. The unit consists of three training squadrons which will provide advanced training to the pilots selected for operating the fighter jets.

Since 2010, the BAF has taken the delivery of sixteen Chengdu F-7BGI fighter aircraft, sixteen Yakovlev Yak-130 advanced jet trainers, two C-130J transport aircraft, nine K-8W jet trainer aircraft, three Let L-410 Turbolet transport trainer aircraft and twenty three CJ-6 basic trainers. Process is going on for the procurement of sixteen multirole combat aircraft.

The BAF has also taken the delivery of 21 Mi-171Sh combat transport helicopters, four AgustaWestland AW139 maritime SAR helicopters and two AW 119KX training helicopters since 2010. The procurement process for eight attack helicopters is ongoing.

The BAF gained surface-to-air missile capability by introducing FM-90 short-range air defence missiles in 2011. To date, BAF has taken delivery of two regiments of FM-90 systems. The BAF received an Italian long-range Selex RAT-31DL air defence radar in 2019. On February 28, 2025, a group of assailant set Selex RAT-31DL air defence radar on fire in Cox Bazar. 

Bangladesh has signed a government-to-government contract with the United Kingdom for the supply of two off-the-shelf C-130J aircraft currently in service with the Royal Air Force. In June 2019, another contract was signed for the procurement of an additional three off-the-shelf C-130J aircraft from the UK. As of September 2020, three of the aircraft have been delivered.

On 20 June 2018, the Bangladesh Air Force signed a contract with China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corporation (CATIC) for the procurement of seven K-8 jet training aircraft.
On 15 October 2020, BAF received these seven K-8 jet trainers.

===UN mission deployment===

More than 600+ BAF personnel, including officers and airmen, and 10 BAF helicopters are currently deployed to various UN missions. Another C-130 transport aircraft is providing support to a UN mission in Africa. With the deployment of C-130 aircraft and its personnel, Bangladesh became the largest troop-contributing country on UN peacekeeping missions.

==Chief of Air Staff==
Bangladesh Air Force is headed by an air officer and he is in the rank of air chief marshal. In 1972, this chief of air staff which is abbreviated as coas was created (in april 1972), and the first air chief was A. K. Khandker whose rank was air vice marshal, all air chiefs till Fakhrul Azam (served as air chief from 2002 to 2007) was air vice marshals, Shah Mohammad Ziaur Rahman was the first air chief who served in this post in the rank of air marshal from 2007 to 2012. Abu Esrar (served as air chief from 2015 to 2018) was the first person who served as air chief in the rank of air chief marshal and since him all air chiefs are air chief marshals.

==Current modernisation==
The BAF has an ongoing modernisation programme, &quot;Forces Goal 2030&quot;. To perform its increasing duties and responsibilities, the air force is being divided into two separate commands: Southern and Northern. A new airbase is being set up under Southern Command at Barishal with an emphasis on maritime security. Another airbase is under construction at Sylhet.

On 29 October 2019, the Italian company Leonardo announced that it secured a contract to supply &quot;Kronos Land&quot; 3D AESA radar systems to the Bangladesh Air Force to provide air surveillance and detect and track targets in tactical environments. The number of radars ordered were not disclosed.

In the third Bangladesh-UK strategic dialogue held in May 2019, the two countries desired to further strengthen the defence ties between them. The United Kingdom expressed its readiness to support Bangladesh with the procurement of high-calibre multi-role combat aircraft alongside other modernisation programmes. Five ex-RAF &#x27;short-bodied&#x27; C-130Js were ordered in two batches in 2018 and 2019 to replace Bangladesh&#x27;s ageing, second-hand C-130Bs. The first aircraft was delivered in August 2019. They will be used to transport troops and equipment both home and abroad, as well as provide humanitarian assistance and support UN peacekeeping missions. The fourth aircraft landed at the Bangabandhu Airbase in Dhaka on 20 February 2023.

In October 2019, US officials said Bangladesh requested to purchase advanced military equipment from the United States, including multi-role combat fighters, attack helicopters and surface-to-air missile systems. The US offered the Bangladesh Air Force two types of attack helicopter,s and the BAF opted for the AH-64 Apache. In January 2020, Boeing confirmed that the AH-64E attack helicopter was down-selected by the BAF after a competitive bidding process. Any purchase of AH-64 Apache helicopters depends on Bangladesh and the United States signing Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) and &quot;General Security of Military Information Agreement&quot; (GSOMIA) agreements. However, in late December 2021, it was reported that Bangladesh was now finalizing a government-to-government (G2G) deal with Russia to buy 8 Mi-28NEs with the necessary equipment, along with operations and maintenance training. As of 2025, the Bangladesh government has not signed any deal for attack helicopter.

In January 2020, Anisul Huq, the minister responsible for defence affairs in the parliament at that time, told the parliament that the process is ongoing to procure 16 multirole combat aircraft, eight attack helicopters, three VVIP helicopters, two air defence radar units, 24 primary trainer aircraft, two light aircraft, one K-8W simulator, four MRAP vehicles, one AW-119 simulator, 2 counter drone surveillance radar system and one mobile ATC tower and a life extension and upgrade of its MiG-29 aircraft.
In 2021, Bangladesh Air Force requested the Bangladesh Government to earmark around 25,200-crores taka (2.5 billion euro) for 16 Western-origin multirole fighter jets. In order to sign the agreement and for the first installment council, the Bangladesh Air Force requested the allocation of 6,300-crores taka for the 2021-22 financial year. In 2021, Eurofighter World Magazine reported Bangladesh as a potential customer for the Eurofighter Typhoon. Bangladesh’s Chief Adviser&#x27;s press wing has dismissed a report about a potential deal or discussion with France for Rafale fighter jets.

In June 2021, the Bangladesh Air Force revealed an order for 24 Grob G 120TP trainer aircraft. According to Masihuzzaman Serniabat, the previous COAS, the Bangladesh Air Force ordered 24 trainer aircraft from Grob. Under the deal, Grob Aircraft will also install a composite material (fiberglass reinforced plastic and carbon fibre composites) repair workshop and a propeller repair workshop in Bangladesh.

On January 15, a high-level defense delegation from Bangladesh visited Pakistan.On the visit Bangladesh shows interest to acquire JF-17 Block 3. Source says that Bangladesh may acquire up to 32 JF-17 Block 3.

<text>Donald Ibrahim Swann (30 September 1923 – 23 March 1994) was a British composer, musician, singer and entertainer. He was one half of Flanders and Swann, writing and performing comic songs with Michael Flanders.

==Early life==
Donald Swann was born in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, Wales. His father, Herbert Alfredovich Swann, was a Russian doctor of English descent, from the expatriate community that started out as the Muscovy Company. His mother, Naguimé Sultán Swann (born Piszóva), was a Turkmen-Russian nurse from Ashgabat, now part of Turkmenistan. They were refugees from the Russian Revolution. Swann&#x27;s great-grandfather, Alfred Trout Swan, a draper from Lincolnshire, emigrated to Russia in 1840 and married the daughter of the horologist to the tsars. Some time later the family added a second &#x27;n&#x27; to their surname. His uncle Alfred wrote the first biography of Alexander Scriabin in English.

The family moved to London, where Swann attended Dulwich College Preparatory School and Westminster School. It was at the latter that he first met Michael Flanders, a fellow pupil. In July and August 1940 they staged a revue called &quot;Go To It&quot;. The pair then went their separate ways during World War II, but were later to establish a musical partnership.

In 1941 Swann was awarded an exhibition to Christ Church, Oxford, to read modern languages. He was a Quaker and pacifist. In 1942 he registered as a conscientious objector and served with the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit (a Quaker relief organisation) in Egypt, Palestine and Greece. After the war, Swann returned to Oxford to read Russian and Modern Greek.

His musical work with Michael Flanders involved writing songs with intelligent patter and light opera, Flanders providing the words and Swann composing the music.

==Career==

When by chance Swann and Flanders met again in 1948 it led to the start of their professional partnership. They began writing songs and light opera, Swann writing the music and Flanders writing the words. Their songs were performed by artists such as Ian Wallace and Joyce Grenfell. They subsequently wrote two two-man revues, &quot;At the Drop of a Hat&quot; and &quot;At the Drop of Another Hat&quot;, which they performed all over the world until their partnership ended in 1967.

At the same time, Swann was maintaining a prolific musical output, writing the music for several operas and operettas, including a full-length version of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Perelandra&quot;, and a setting of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s poems from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to music in &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot; song cycle.

In 1953–59 Swann provided music for seven plays by Henry Reed on the BBC Third Programme, generally known as the Hilda Tablet plays after one of the fictional characters, a lady composer of avant-garde &quot;musique concrète renforcée&quot;. Besides incidental music, Swann composed for this character an opera, &quot;Emily Butter&quot; and several other complete works. A lifelong friendship with Sydney Carter resulted in scores of songs, the best known being &quot;The Youth of the Heart&quot; which reappeared in &quot;At the Drop of A Hat&quot;, and a musical &quot;Lucy and the Hunter&quot;.

After his partnership with Flanders ended, Swann continued to give solo concerts and to write for other singers. He also formed the &quot;Swann Singers&quot; and toured with them in the 1970s. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, he continued performing in various combinations with singers and colleagues and as a solo artist. One such was a jazz partnership with trumpeter Digby Fairweather and vocalist Lisa Lincoln for the &quot;Swann in Jazz&quot; series of concerts and the 1994 CD.

It is estimated that Swann wrote or set to music nearly 2,000 songs throughout his career. He wrote a number of hymn tunes which appear in modern standard hymn books. In the later years of his life he &#x27;discovered&#x27; Victorian poetry and composed some of his most profound and moving songs, settings of William Blake, Emily Dickinson, Christina Rossetti, Oscar Wilde and others. A selection of his solo songs were recorded on a Hyperion double CD issued in 2017.

==Personal life==
In the 1970s, Swann became a Sponsor of the Peace Pledge Union.

Donald Swann was married twice; he married Janet Oxborrow in 1955 and they were divorced in 1983. His second wife was the art historian Alison Smith. 

==Death==
In 1992 he was diagnosed with cancer. He died at Trinity Hospice in South London on 23 March 1994.

<text>Rogers Cable is Canada&#x27;s largest cable television service provider with about 2.25 million television customers, and over 930,000 Internet subscribers, primarily in Southern and Eastern Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador. Rogers Cable is a division of Rogers Communications Canada Inc., the operating unit of Rogers Communications Inc.

As of October 2024, the division does business as Rogers Xfinity, as part of a brand and technology licensing agreement with U.S. cable provider Comcast.

==History==

Rogers was one of the first cable-system operators in Canada, having secured licences covering much of the then city of Toronto in the late 1960s. One of the first important acquisitions was in 1979, when Ted Rogers purchased a controlling interest in Canadian Cablesystems (CCL), which operated cable companies across Ontario, including the then City of North York, Oshawa/Whitby, London, Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge, Brantford, and Newmarket, and joined the CCL properties with his cable interests. In 1980, Rogers purchased Premier Cable, which controlled the system in Vancouver, parts of Ontario, and had investments in Irish cable companies in Dublin, Galway and Waterford. In 1986 Rogers sold their shares of Irish companies to the Irish state broadcaster (RTÉ) and state telecoms company (Eircom); these cable companies are now part of the UPC Ireland network.

In 1981, Rogers entered the U.S. cable market, obtaining franchises in Orange County, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, and purchased the cable system in San Antonio. These assets were acquired by Paragon Cable in 1989 for over US$1 billion; Paragon in turn was acquired by Time Warner Cable several years later.

Rogers continued to buy other operators; the largest such acquisition came with Rogers&#x27; 1994 acquisition of Maclean-Hunter, at that time also among the largest cable operators. Through its acquisition of Maclean-Hunter, Rogers has also briefly owned cable systems in the United States, which it promptly sold to Comcast in 1994. In March 2000, Rogers agreed to swap systems with Shaw Communications, exchanging its systems in British Columbia for Shaw systems in Quebec and Ontario. The deals gave Rogers and Shaw more consistent service footprints in Eastern and Western Canada respectively.

In 2008, Rogers announced a takeover offer for Aurora Cable, a cable service provider in York Region, Ontario.

On September 9, 2009, Rogers Cable filed a lawsuit in an attempt to prevent Shaw Communications from acquiring Mountain Cablevision of Hamilton, Ontario, on the basis that the two companies had agreed not to encroach on each other&#x27;s respective territories (Rogers in Eastern Canada, Shaw in Western Canada), and speculated that Shaw would make other acquisitions in Eastern Canada after buying Mountain. Shaw argued that the agreement violated unfair competition laws. The suit was quickly thrown out by the Ontario Superior Court, arguing that the non-compete agreement limited competition, and that Rogers&#x27; claims of future harm were &quot;speculative in the extreme&quot;. The sale would eventually go through later that year. In January 2013, as part of a larger exchange of assets between the two companies, Shaw pulled out of Hamilton and sold the Mountain Cablevision business to Rogers.

In 2010, a corporate reorganization resulted in Rogers Cable being dissolved as a distinct legal entity, and its operations absorbed into Rogers Communications Partnership, a general partnership jointly held by Rogers Communications and its subsidiary Fido Solutions.

In October 2015, Rogers announced that it would begin to offer 4K-compatible set-top boxes, beginning in Toronto and expanding to its other markets in 2016. Telecasts of 4K sporting events from Sportsnet and TSN began to be carried on these set-top boxes in January 2016.

In December 2016, Rogers announced that it had scrapped a planned project to develop its own IPTV-based television platform, and would instead license Comcast&#x27;s X1 platform. The new platform, Rogers Ignite TV, launched in August 2018, which includes a &quot;cloud DVR&quot;, voice-enabled remote (specifically a Comcast-developed model which won a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in 2017), and the ability to aggregate linear television and online video content in a single interface. Rogers began to migrate existing digital cable customers to Ignite in October 2019. Rogers announced a deeper technology partnership with Comcast in April 2024, and began rebranding its Ignite products as &quot;Rogers Xfinity&quot; later that year.

==Canadian cable territories==
Rogers Cable currently serves communities in most of Canada, including most larger communities in Newfoundland and Labrador, nearly all of New Brunswick, selected areas of eastern Quebec near the New Brunswick border (including Carleton-sur-Mer), Ontario (including nearly all of the Toronto area as well as the areas of Ottawa, London, Kitchener-Waterloo, York Region, Barrie, and parts of Hamilton), parts of Manitoba (including Winnipeg), parts of Saskatchewan (particularly in Moose Jaw, Prince Albert, Saskatoon, and Swift Current), Alberta, and British Columbia.

Over the years, and at various times, Rogers has owned all or part of various cable operators serving areas across Canada, including Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary, and Northern Ontario. All of the systems in Western Canada were traded to Shaw Communications in late 2000, in exchange for that company&#x27;s assets in Ontario and New Brunswick, and many of the others were sold to Cogeco. On April 3, 2023, Rogers acquired Shaw, adding its Western Canada portfolio back to the company.

==Other investments==

===CPAC===
Through Rogers Cable, Rogers is the largest shareholder (41.4%) in CPAC, a national public affairs and politics cable channel based in Ottawa, that consists of both an English- and a French-language feed. CPAC&#x27;s main programming consists of live and delayed coverage of the House of Commons and the Senate.

===Retail stores===
Rogers Cable previously operated a chain of video rental stores known as Rogers Plus; it launched as Rogers Video in 1988, after which it grew by acquiring smaller chains. The Rogers Video chain and Rogers Wireless retail stores were merged into a single chain known as Rogers Plus in 2007. After 23 years in business, Rogers Plus discontinued movie and game rentals in 2012, and the chain&#x27;s remaining locations were re-tooled as Rogers stores for selling the company&#x27;s services.

==Criticism==

===Negative option billing===
In the beginning of 1995, Rogers along with several other cable companies, added a number of new cable channels under a negative option billing plan. Subscribers opting out of paying for the new channels stood to lose much of their existing specialty channel programming. The participating cable companies were hit by both regulatory and public opinion backlash and ultimately were forced to split the negative-option channels into two separately purchasable blocks, a move which Rogers had initially opposed as &quot;not technologically feasible&quot;.

===Dropping of WPBS and WQLN===
In July 2009, Rogers Cable announced that on August 18, 2009, they would be replacing PBS affiliates WQLN of Erie, Pennsylvania and WPBS-TV of Watertown, New York on its London and Ottawa systems, respectively, with Detroit, Michigan&#x27;s PBS station, WTVS. A representative for Rogers said that they were replacing WQLN and WPBS with WTVS, because viewers wanted &quot;a feed that has a higher-quality reception.&quot; WQLN and WPBS, however, had shown great concern for Rogers&#x27; move, as these are the largest cities in the stations&#x27; respective coverage areas and much of their pledges come from Rogers viewers. In addition, both stations first heard of the discontinuance not through Rogers, but through their loyal viewers.

On July 30, 2009, it was announced that Rogers would keep WPBS and WQLN on its systems, after both stations announced a fibre-based connection with Rogers. Additional funds will be allocated to complete the transition; while WQLN announced that they will spend $55,000 to provide a connection, WPBS agreed with Rogers not to disclose the cost of the fibre-optic signal for their own station.

=== Software issues ===
The introduction of Rogers&#x27; &quot;Navigatr&quot; user interface in mid-2015 was heavily criticized by users for being poorly designed and harder to use. Rogers began to address these issues with a new version it began to deploy in December 2015.

On May 6, 2016, Rogers was criticized when a nightly 2:00 a.m. reboot of NextBox set-top boxes caused viewers to miss the conclusion of an NHL playoff game between the Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks, which had gone to triple overtime. The broadcast was, ironically, being carried by Rogers-owned network Sportsnet 360, prompting &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; to compare the incident to the &quot;Heidi&quot; game. A Rogers spokesperson apologized for the incident and stated that they were investigating the issue, as the reboot was not supposed to occur while watching live programming.

<text>The Peugeot 205 is a four-passenger, front-engine, supermini (B-segment) car manufactured and marketed by Peugeot over a sixteen-year production run from 1983 to 1999, over a single generation. Developed from &quot;Projet&quot; M24 and introduced on 25 February 1983, the 205 replaced the Peugeot 104 and the Talbot Samba, using major elements from their design. It won &quot;What Car?&quot; Car of the Year for 1984. It was also declared &quot;car of the decade&quot; by CAR Magazine in 1990. Peugeot stopped marketing the 205 in 1999 in favor of its new front-engined 206. The 106, which was introduced in 1991, effectively took over as Peugeot&#x27;s smaller front-engined model in their lineup. The 106 was indeed developed as a close sibling of the Citroën AX, sharing many components and a platform that later evolved into the Citroën Saxo.

==History==

Before the 205, Peugeot was considered the most conservative of France&#x27;s &quot;big three&quot; car manufacturers, producing large saloons such as the 504 and 505, although it had entered the modern supermini market in 1973 with the Peugeot 104. The genesis of the 205 lay within Peugeot&#x27;s takeover in 1978 of Chrysler&#x27;s European divisions Simca and the former Rootes Group, which had the necessary expertise in making small cars including the Simca 1100 in France and Hillman Imp in Britain. It was around this time that Peugeot began to work on the development of a new supermini for the 1980s.

It was launched on 24 February 1983, and was launched in right-hand drive form for the UK market in September that year. Shortly after its launch, it was narrowly pipped to the European Car of the Year award by the similar sized Fiat Uno, but ultimately (according to the award organizers) it would enjoy a better image and a longer high market demand than its Italian competitor. It was one of five important small cars to be launched onto the European market within a year of each other: the other four were the Uno, the second generation Ford Fiesta, the original Opel Corsa (sold as the Vauxhall Nova on the British market) and the original Nissan Micra. Its launch also closely followed that of the Austin Metro and Volkswagen Polo Mk2.

The styling of the 205 is often thought to be a Pininfarina design, although Gerard Welter claims that it is an in-house design; Pininfarina only styled the Cabriolet. It is often credited as the car that turned Peugeot&#x27;s fortunes around.

The fully independent suspension used the now standard PSA Peugeot Citroën layout that had debuted in the Peugeot 305 estate. A key ingredient of the success of the 205, it had MacPherson struts at the front and trailing arms with torsion bars at the rear. The rear suspension was very compact, designed to minimise suspension intrusion into the boot, giving a wide flat loadspace, while providing excellent ride and handling.

Early 205s used the X petrol engine from the older Peugeot 104, although these were later (1987–1988) replaced with the newer XU and TU-series engines, which were of PSA design. Engines ranged in displacement from 954 cc to 1905 cc, in carburettor or fuel injected versions.

The diesel models employed the PSA XUD engine, lifted from the Citroën BX which was introduced in September 1982. These engines had a capacity of 1769 cc (XUD7) and 1905 cc (XUD9) and are closely related to the XU5 and XU9 petrol engines in the BX16 and BX19 of the time. The diesel engines were world-beating and so petrol-like that many buyers were won over by petrol car performance combined with diesel economy. For instance, the 205 GRD (1.8 Diesel, , ) was as fast as, yet smoother than, the 205 GR (1.4 Petrol, , ), due to the engine developing peak torque at much lower rpm, while using much less fuel.

There were various versions intended for commercial use, such as the two-seater XA-series. There was also the &quot;205 Multi&quot;, a tall-bodied special version on XA or XE-basis built by independent coachbuilders like Gruau and Durisotti. Gruau called their XA-based two-seater version the &quot;VU&quot;, while the five-seat XE-based version was called the &quot;VP&quot;. Durisotti began building the 205 Multi in 1986; it was called the &quot;205 Multi New Look&quot;.

===1990 and onwards===

The 205 was an instant hit, and its styling was echoed in every Peugeot model that was to follow, as well as markedly changing the company&#x27;s perception with buyers - having long been regarded as the most conservative of France&#x27;s major manufacturers, and had long been associated with large saloon and station wagon type cars. Such was the success of the 205, its exterior styling never was never significantly altered in its 15-year production run apart from small details. There was a dashboard redesign for the 1988 model year, and in late 1990 the 205 received a minor facelift with new door design and cards, clear front indicators, new &#x27;smoked&#x27; rear light clusters, single point petrol injection and catalytic converters were introduced, to meet the new 1992 pollution limits. These updates came at a crucial time, as 1990 also saw the arrival of a completely new French competitor, the Renault Clio, while the Rover Metro and Volkswagen Polo were also heavily updated, and Ford had already replaced its Fiesta with a third generation model. Still, the 205 was still widely regarded in the motoring press as the benchmark car in this sector by 1990. Indeed, &quot;Top Gear&quot;&#x27;s Jeremy Clarkson described the 1990 edition as &quot;an instant modern Classic.&quot;

At the beginning of 1993, Peugeot launched the 306, which officially replaced the 309; the arrival of this car also diminished the 205&#x27;s role (and its sales figures) in the Peugeot range, as had the arrival of the smaller 106 in September 1991 – although the final demise of the 205 was still some years away.

The engines were continuously updated, with the new TU engines introduced in 1988. In 1991, the 205 dTurbo was launched with a powerful turbocharged version of the 1,769 cc xud 
diesel engine.

After several years of gradually declining sales, the Peugeot 205 was discontinued in the United Kingdom in 1996. The Peugeot 205 was still offered in the &quot;Sacré Numéro&quot; and &quot;Génération&quot; models until the end of the production in 1998. The last models were GLD 1.8 configuration and were sold in Argentina. Most of the later European versions were only sold in France. Due to the pressure from the market, with buyers wanting a Peugeot supermini in the mould of the 205 again, the company finally built a direct replacement in the 206, which was launched in 1998. 5,278,050 Peugeot 205s have been sold, and a significant percentage of them were still in circulation as of 2009. By 2014, there were still as many as 14,000 on the road in the United Kingdom, compared to the peak high of 374,773 in 1994. With potentially as many 400,000 sales in the UK, it became the best selling car ever sold by Peugeot in the UK – although its success was emulated a few years later by the larger 306 and later by the 206. It also helped boost the popularity of the Peugeot brand there, and was at least a factor in Peugeot&#x27;s decision to phase out the Talbot brand in the mid 1980s when launching new models to be built at the former Rootes Group plant near Coventry and the former Simca plant at Poissy.

The 205 was first available as a GTI in 1984 (the same year that the three-door bodystyle debuted) and was initially powered by a fuel injected 1.6 petrol engine. The 1.9 GTI was launched in 1986 and the 1.9-litre engine was also used in the GTI version of the larger 309. The 205 GTI was discontinued in 1994, by which time Peugeot was producing high performance versions of the 106 and 306.

===Range===
==Versions==
Most of the versions had manual transmission. The 205 had a rather unusual trim level scheme for its models; three-door models (apart from the GTI) were badged &#x27;X&#x27; and five-door models were badged &#x27;G&#x27;.

Trim levels were:
* XA and XAD, two-seater commercial versions. There was also the &quot;Multi&quot;, tall-bodied special versions built by independents such as Gruau and Durisotti.
* 1.1 litre petrol, 4-cylinder – , 1124 cc
* 1.8 litre diesel, 4-cylinder – , 1769 cc
* XE/GE, available with:
* 1.0 litre petrol, 4-cylinder – , 954 cc
* 1.1 litre petrol, 4-cylinder – , 1124 cc
Five-door versions were badged GE
* XL/GL, available with:
* 1.0 litre petrol, 4-cylinder – , 954 cc

Five-door versions were badged GL (Note: The 1.0 litre GL was not offered in the UK). The 1.8 litre GLD diesel model was popular, and &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine recommended it as a Used Car Buy in August 1992. It was also a &quot;Which?&quot; magazine best buy for five years running in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was, (and is as a used buy), a better car than the 106 diesel that replaced it.
* XR/GR, available with:
* 1.1 litre petrol, 4-cylinder – , 1124 cc (higher output for fuel injected and catalyzed version)
* 1.2 litre petrol, 4-cylinder – , 1204 cc (GR only, Spain only, Simca/Talbot engine)

* 1.4 litre petrol I4 – 85 bhp 1360 cc TU3S engine.
* 1.6 litre (1580 cc) petrol
The 5 door model was called the GT, and used the same 1360 cc TU3s engine as the XS (UK)
* GTX, only available in Spain with:
* 1.6 litre petrol, 4-cylinder – , 1592 cc (Simca/Talbot engine)
* GTX (UK Version), 1993–94.

From 1994, the X/G trim scheme was replaced by &quot;Mardi Gras&quot;, &quot;Colorline&quot;, &quot;Forever&quot; and &quot;Accent&quot;. &#x27;GT&#x27; versions were now offered only in Continental Europe with a 1.6-litre engine; the UK models were badged &quot;Mardi Gras&quot;. However, GTI versions continued unchanged.
* SI, 

There is also an SI version believed to have been released in Australia and Japan, featuring a 65 kW 1.6 engine with max torque of 132 Nm offered in either 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission, it had styling from the GTI inside and out, drive.com.au were quoted as saying:

&quot;Although the 205 graced Australian shores with the GTi model in 1988, It wasn&#x27;t until 1992 (with the Japanese Yen rising and memories of the Rainbow Warrior fading) that it made fiscal sense for Peugeot to start selling a version that could compete on price with the Toyota Corolla, which at the time was Australia&#x27;s biggest selling small car. The SI model, with its 1.6 litre motor, was introduced to do this. Although the 1.6 in the SI was larger than most of the motors in its European siblings, it was regarded as a bit of an escargot in Australia.&quot;

==High performance variants==

===205 GTI/CTI===
The 1.6 litre GTI was launched in 1984, and came with a XU5J engine, producing , for the 1987 model year the XU5J received the cylinder head with larger valves thus becoming XU5JA. The new engine was quoted for . The 1.9 litre GTI came with an XU9JA engine producing , although later models with a catalytic converter produce . Internally these engines are very similar, the main differences on 1.9 litre versions being the longer stroke, oil cooler, and some parts of the fuel injection system. The shorter stroke 1.6 litre engine is famed for being revvy and eager, while the 1.9 litre feels lazier and torquier. Outside the engine bay the main differences between the 1.6 GTI and the 1.9 GTI are half-leather seats (1.9 GTI) vs. cloth seats (1.6 GTI); and disc brakes all-round (1.9 GTI) vs. discs at the front and drum brakes at the back (1.6 GTI); as well as the 14&quot; alloy (Speedline SL201) wheels (1.6 GTI) vs. 15&quot; (Speedline SL299) alloys (1.9 GTI).

The 205 is still often treated as a benchmark in group car tests of the newest GTI models or equivalent. Peugeot itself has never truly recreated this success in future GTI models, although they came very close with the highly regarded GTI-6 variant of the Peugeot 306. A cabriolet version of the 205, known as the CJ/CT/CTI, was designed and partially assembled by Pininfarina of Italy. The CTI version offered the same plastic arches and wheels as the 1.6 GTI. Some later models incorporated the catalysed 1.9-litre engine.

The main aesthetic difference between the GTI/CTi versions and other 205 models were the plastic wheel arches and trim, beefier front and rear bumper valances. The shell also underwent some minor changes, including larger wheel arches (to suit the larger wheels on the GTI and CTi), and the suspension was redesigned and sat lower on the GTI with stiffer springs, different wishbones and a drop-linked anti-roll bar.

With the early success of the 205 GTI in Europe, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; reported in 1984 that Peugeot was seriously considering adding it to its US lineup, even though Peugeot had a more upmarket image in the United States. Nothing ever came of such rumours, however, and any talk of Peugeot expanding its presence in US became moot when the company was forced to pull out in 1991.

Sales of the GTI in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s were badly hit by soaring insurance premiums, brought about by high theft and &#x27;joyriding&#x27; of cars of this sort. Increasingly stringent emissions regulations meant the 1.6 GTI went out of production in 1992, while the 1.9-litre was sold for a couple more years thanks to re-engineering of the engine to enable it to work properly with a catalytic converter, which dropped power to .

In October 2020 Peugeot announced that their heritage brand &quot;l&#x27;Aventure Peugeot&quot; would make a factory restoration program for the 205 GTI available in 2021 as part of the company&#x27;s 210th anniversary celebration. This program is intended to be expanded to other Peugeot (and possibly Citroën) models later, but will begin with the 205 GTI as it is one of the most desirable Peugeot built that is also available in large numbers. The cars will be restored to as-new condition, with certain no longer available parts being made on 3D-printers.

===Special 205 GTI editions===
Peugeot produced a number of limited edition 205 GTI models over the car&#x27;s life:

Across 1989–1990, 1200 GTIs were made in the then new colours of Miami blue (bright metallic blue) and Sorrento Green (a very dark pearlescent green). The cars were made in an equal mix of 300 blue 1.6 litre, 300 green 1.6 litre, 300 blue 1.9 litre and 300 green 1.9 litre. The cars had a sliding sunroof, power steering and full grey leather interior as standard, together with grey carpets and doorcards. These paint colours were later added to the list of available colours for mainstream models.
The Gentry was a limited edition version of the 205, it had 1.6 GTI suspension combined with a detuned 1.9 litre engine (as fitted to export market GTIs such as those for Australia and Switzerland) but with an automatic gearbox. Only 300 models were made in Sorrento Green and Aztec Gold (sometimes called Mayfair Beige). They came with full leather trim and real wood trim, power steering and heated mirrors in the UK, as well as the same body side trims as the GTI – which led to the Gentry often being mistaken for a GTI.

A production run of 200 limited edition 1.9 GTI cars was commenced in 1991 for the Japanese market. Due to a breakdown in trade negotiations the production run ceased at what was believed to be 33 units which were subsequently sold off to the European market. All the cars were in automatic transmission guise, having power steering sunroof and air conditioning as standard. The Japanese edition was easily identifiable by having the raised bonnet normally attributed to the diesel models. Pepperpot alloys and cloth trim were used, more reminiscent of the 1.6 GTI cars.

The Griffe was a special GTI edition for mainland Europe, and was sold in France, Germany and the Netherlands. It was bright green (called &#x27;Laser&#x27; Green or &#x27;Vert Fluorite&#x27;), and came equipped with all available vendor options at that time except air-conditioning, but including full black leather interior, ABS, power steering and sunroof. 1652 Griffes were made, all in laser green and with grey alloy wheels with a silver rim.

The 1FM was produced for the UK market in 1992 to coincide with the 25th birthday of BBC Radio 1. Only 25 were made and each car was individually numbered with a small brass plate. The car was black with &#x27;Radio 1FM 25th&#x27; bodywork decals, grey Speedline alloy wheels and came with all options fitted as standard, including ABS, air conditioning, full leather interior, remote central locking, catalytic converter and power steering. A bespoke stereo system including a CD changer, CD head unit, amplifier, uprated door speakers and an acoustic rear shelf containing 200W 6x9 speakers was specified by Clarion. One was raffled at a Radio 1 event, and Radio 1 ran a competition on air to win one.

===205 STDT===

In 1993 Peugeot introduced the 205 and 405 STDT, higher performance diesel models that offered some of the GTI&#x27;s sporting qualities in the diesel engined part of the range. The 205 STDT (special trim diesel turbo) was available only in the 3-door bodyshell with a 1,769 cc turbo diesel engine (XUD7 T/K) with the trim and luxuries of the 205 GTI. The car was initially marketed towards executives, with soft cloth bucket seats in Beige with matching carpet and dashboard, as also found in the Gentry models. The car featured PAS, central locking, electric windows and also electrically heated mirrors. Many were fitted with a large, vacuum-seal slide sunroof.

The brochure specification from 1993 on the STDT lists its equipment as:
* 1769cc, 78 bhp turbo diesel engine 
* 5-speed manual gearbox
* Power steering
* Alloy wheels (different from the GTI models)
* Bodyside mouldings, wheelarch finishers and bumper inserts (chrome inserts)
* Long range driving lamps
* Optional sliding sunroof
* Heated door mirrors
* Choice of body colours: Aztec Gold; Oberon Green; Steel Grey
* Sports front seats, velour trim
* 50/50 split rear seats
* Leather-trimmed sports steering wheel
* Remote control central locking (base models were not remote control, running off the key only)
* Electric front windows
* Tinted glass
* Clarion 97001F digital stereo radio/stereo cassette with 4 speakers
* Lockable glove box with lamp

Its performance data is defined in the brochure from 1993 as:

* Maximum speed: 
* Acceleration 0–100 km/h (62 mph): 12.2 seconds, 0–1000 m: 34.2 seconds.
* Fuel consumption – mpg (L/100 km): constant driving speed 56 mph (90 km/h) – 61.4 (4.6); 75 mph (120 km/h) – 40.9 (6.9); simulated urban driving – 42.8 (6.6)

The 205 STDT is only found in three colours; Oberon Green, Steel Grey and Aztec Gold. Production of the car was approximately one year between 1993 and 1994.

As of the fourth quarter of 2019, there were only 24 STDTs left on the roads and 148 SORN in the UK.

===205 Rallye===

From 1988 to 1992 Peugeot produced another variant of the 205, the 205 Rallye, which was engineered and produced by Peugeot–Talbot sport. This edition of the 205 was positioned as a cost-effective alternative to the 205 GTI, retaining its sporty character, but being less expensive to buy or maintain.

To achieve this, Peugeot used a derivative of the TU-series engine used in the post-1987 205s, which was designated TU24. The engine is essentially the same engine as was in the 1.1-litre 205 with the cylinders bored out to a total engine displacement of 1294 cc, a sports camshaft and twin Weber carburetors. The 1.3-litre engine produced at 6,800 rpm. The car got the 1.6 GTI front suspension with ventilated brake discs, and the 1.6 GTI rear axle with drum brakes.

The 205 Rallye was completely stripped of almost all soundproofing, electrical systems or other luxury items, bringing down the weight to no more than . Its minimalistic equipment, together with the high revs needed to unleash all of the engine&#x27;s horsepower, gives the 205 Rallye a very spartan character and makes it a difficult but rewarding car to drive hard, which is one of the reasons it is now very popular among 205 GTI enthusiasts. Peugeot expected to build around 5000 Rallyes. In the end 30,111 Rallyes were produced, even though they were only sold in certain mainland European markets (including France, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and the Netherlands).

The distinctive aesthetic features of the 205 Rallye include the squarer wheel arches (which are different from GTI arches), the steel body-coloured wheels and the rainbow-coloured Peugeot-Talbot sport decals on the front grille and the tailgate. They were only available in white. The Rallye was sold with a reduced-weight interior with the Peugeot-Talbot sport logo embroidered in the front seats.

From 1990 to 1992 Peugeot also built a 1.9 litre version of the 205 Rallye. Only about 1000 of them were produced and they were only sold in Germany, because the 1.3 litre version did not meet German road regulations. The 1.9 Rallye is just a 1.9 GTI with the Rallye bodyshell and the new-style clear indicators and rear light units. Although they are even rarer than the 1.3 Rallye, they are less popular among Peugeot enthusiasts, because they lack the raw and spartan character of the 1.3 Rallye and are heavier.

In 1992 Peugeot introduced the Rallye to the UK market, it was available in three colours (500 white, 250 yellow, 80 blue) and was essentially a re-badged XT. It came equipped with black cloth seats embroidered with the Peugeot-Talbot Sport logo, the Peugeot-Talbot sports colours behind the front arches and over the back arches, as well as the same markings on the grill and tailgate of its European brother. It was powered by an iron-blocked 1360 cc TU3.2 engine with the same twin-choke Solex carburettor found on the earlier XS engine. It produced and achieved with a 0–60 mph of 11.7 seconds.

After the 205 Rallye, Peugeot again used the &#x27;Rallye&#x27; designation for some of its 106 and 306 models.

===205 Turbo 16 (T16)===
To homologate the 205 T16 (&quot;Turbo 16&quot; in France) Group B rally car, Peugeot had to produce 200 road-going examples. According to the Group B regulations, these had to be based on a current production road car. Peugeot decided to base the Group B rally car on the two door version of the 205.

The body was built by Heuliez, where standard three door bodyshells from the production line were delivered and heavily modified. Heuliez cut off the complete rear of the car and welded in a transverse firewall between the B-posts. The rear frame was then built in a mixture of sheet steel profiles and tubes. The front was modified in a similar way with a tube frame carrying the front suspension. The completed bodies were delivered to Simca (Talbot) for the 200-series production cars and to Peugeot Talbot Sport for the competition versions.

The engine, based on the cast iron block of the diesel version of the then new XU engine family, albeit with a specially developed 16-valve head, was moved from the front of the vehicle to the rear, transforming it from a front-engine, front-wheel-drive to a rear-mid engine four-wheel-drive automobile. The gearbox came from the Citroën SM but was mounted transversely. The car had all wheel drive.

All street versions (VINs P1 to P200) were left hand drive and identically kitted out in dark grey colour, except the first (VIN P1) that was painted white and carried all the competition cars&#x27; decoration for demonstration purposes. The competition cars of the first evolution series (VIN C1 to C20) were built at the sport department Peugeot Talbot Sport and presented to the public at the same day as the standard street version. Later competition vehicles of the Evolution 2 series (VIN C201 to C220) were built differently as the rear spaceframe had no more sheet steel profiles in it but was composed entirely of tubes.

Apart from the appearance, the road variants had practically nothing in common with the regular production model. They shared the with a bore × stroke of transversely-mounted, mid-engine, four-wheel-drive layout of the rally car. It did, however, have less than half the power at around at 6,750 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. The T was for (KKK) Turbo, fuel fed by Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a compression ratio of 6.5:1; the 16 stands for DOHC 16 valves. Outwardly similar to a normal 205, the T16 had wider wheel arches, and the whole rear section lifted up to give access to the engine. Underneath, the complex drivetrain from the rally car was kept to abide by the Group B rules.

In addition to the Group B model, the lesser 205 GTI was also FIA approved for competition in the Group N and Group A categories.
Peugeot Talbot Sport&#x27;s factory 205 T16s under Jean Todt were the most successful cars to compete in the last two years of the World Rally Championship&#x27;s Group B era, winning the 1985 and 1986 Constructors&#x27; and Drivers&#x27; titles with Timo Salonen and Juha Kankkunen respectively against such notable competition from Audi, Lancia and Ford, with an Evolution 2 model being introduced for the latter of those two seasons.

The chassis and engine from this model would later underpin the Peugeot Quasar concept car.

<doc id="377635" wikidata="Q1629768" url="?curid=377635" title="Sportsnet">
<text>Sportsnet is a Canadian English-language discretionary sports specialty channel owned by Rogers Sports &amp; Media. It was established in 1998 as CTV Sportsnet, a joint venture between CTV, Liberty Media, and Rogers Media. CTV parent Bell Globemedia then was required to divest its stake in the network following its 2001 acquisition of competing network TSN. Rogers then became the sole owner of Sportsnet in 2004 after it bought the remaining minority stake that was held by Fox.

The Sportsnet license comprises four 24-hour programming services; Sportsnet was originally licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) as a category A service, operating as a group of regional sports networks offering programming tailored to each feed&#x27;s region (in contrast to TSN, which was licensed at the time to operate as a national sports service, and could only offer limited regional opt-outs). Since 2011, the service has operated under deregulated category C licensing, which allows Sportsnet to operate multiple feeds with no restrictions on alternate programming. In each region, only the local Sportsnet channel is available on analogue cable, but all four channels are available nationally via digital cable (subject to blackouts for some out-of-market teams).

The four Sportsnet feeds air some common programming and simulcast major, national events, but are capable of airing programming autonomously—most prominently regional programming. Sportsnet is the national cable rightsholder of the National Hockey League, and also holds full regional rights to three (and partial regional rights to one) of the league&#x27;s Canadian franchises. It is also the national rightsholder of Major League Baseball in Canada (although most of ESPN&#x27;s MLB broadcasts are sub-licensed to rival network TSN), and the exclusive broadcaster of the co-owned Toronto Blue Jays. It splits regional coverage of the NHL&#x27;s Toronto Maple Leafs and national coverage of the NBA&#x27;s Toronto Raptors with TSN; Rogers Communications and TSN&#x27;s parent company Bell Canada own a joint majority stake in the teams&#x27; parent company.

The Sportsnet brand has since been extended beyond the original regional channels, now encompassing the national channels Sportsnet 360, Sportsnet One (and its regional part-time companion channels), and Sportsnet World; Sportsnet Radio stations in Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary; and &quot;Sportsnet Magazine&quot;. With these brand extensions, Rogers now generally uses &quot;Sportsnet&quot; (by itself) to denote its sports media properties as a whole, and on-air promotions for programs being carried nationally by these four regional feeds often list all four channels separately, or refer to the Sportsnet &quot;regional&quot; (or &quot;main&quot;) channels, to avoid any ambiguity. However, standalone mentions of &quot;Sportsnet&quot; in reference to a specific channel can still generally be assumed to be referring to the four regional channels (or the specific regional channel available locally on analogue cable).

==History==
Sportsnet was approved by the CRTC in September 1996 under the tentative name &quot;S3&quot;, with Baton Broadcasting Inc. (later renamed to CTV Inc.) holding a 40% controlling interest in the network, and 20% minority stakes held by Rogers Media and Liberty Media (in turn a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group). The network proposed a structure with an emphasis on regional programming, operating four feeds to serve different areas of the country.

The network launched on October 9, 1998, as CTV Sportsnet, under the ownership of CTV, Rogers, and Liberty; the latter which owned some of the Fox Sports Net operations that Fox ran in the United States after which the channel was named.

The new network gained credibility before it went on the air, having acquired national cable rights to the National Hockey League from long-time holder TSN. From 1998–99 until 2001–02, Sportsnet aired NHL games to a national audience throughout the regular season, and covered first-round playoff series not involving Canadian teams. Its first live sports event was an NHL opening night telecast between the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers. The national cable rights to the NHL returned to TSN in 2002, though Sportsnet retained regional broadcast rights for most Canadian NHL teams.

===Acquisition by Rogers===
When CTV purchased NetStar, the former parent company of TSN, in 2000, the CRTC ordered CTV to sell either TSN or its stake in Sportsnet. CTV ultimately chose to retain TSN, and sell its stake in Sportsnet. The other shareholders had first right of refusal; as Rogers was the only interested party, it acquired CTV&#x27;s stake in the summer of 2001, and soon after renamed it Rogers Sportsnet. During part of the transition period, during which time the channel was known as &quot;Sportsnet&quot;, CTV was allowed to control programming on both networks, and some cross-affiliation and programs that were going to be tape-delayed on TSN, most notably figure skating, were given to Sportsnet. In 2004, Rogers then bought the remaining 20 percent stake from Fox.

While Sportsnet had been based there from the beginning, TSN&#x27;s operations would move to CTV&#x27;s suburban Toronto complex, 9 Channel Nine Court, following the acquisition. This led to some peculiarities related to the fact that the two rival sports channels were only separated by a &quot;parking lot&quot;, leading to jokes and references from both networks. On April 30, 2008, Rogers Sportsnet moved its broadcast operations from 9 Channel Nine Court to the Rogers Building, a cluster of buildings in the Mount Pleasant-Jarvis Street area of Downtown Toronto. 

=== Expansion ===
In 2010, Rogers began to extend the Sportsnet brand beyond the original regional networks with the August 14 launch of Rogers Sportsnet One – a national companion channel promising 800 hours of live events per year. The channel was also accompanied by additional part-time feeds to serve as overflow channels for its regional NHL coverage.

In January 2011, Rogers&#x27; sports radio stations, CJCL Toronto (&quot;The Fan 590&quot;) and CFAC Calgary (&quot;The Fan 960&quot;), were rebranded as &quot;Sportsnet Radio Fan 590&quot; and &quot;Sportsnet Radio Fan 960&quot; respectively. Critics speculated that the Sportsnet Radio branding was intended to increase synergy with its television counterparts, upon rumors that TSN would be launching a sports radio network of its own.

In July 2011, Rogers announced that it would be rebranding its premium international sports channel Setanta Sports Canada as &quot;Sportsnet World&quot; on October 3, 2011 – a move that would allow the channel better opportunities for cross-promotion with other Sportsnet services. As part of the transition, Setanta Sports sold its minority ownership interest in the channel to MLM Management.

On September 29, 2011, Rogers published the first issue of &quot;Sportsnet Magazine&quot;, a bi-weekly sports magazine positioned &quot;for Canadian sports fans&quot;, covering professional sports from a Canadian perspective. Sports writer Stephen Brunt left his position at &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper to become the magazine&#x27;s back page columnist.

On October 3, 2011, Rogers Sportsnet underwent a major rebranding, introducing a revamped logo and visual appearance designed in conjunction with Troika Design Group, and a new image campaign (&quot;Fuelled By Fans&quot;). Additionally, the network&#x27;s official name was shortened to just Sportsnet. The new logo does not incorporate the previous &quot;player&quot; emblem that had been used in the network&#x27;s branding since its original launch, as research performed by Rogers indicated that its association with Sportsnet did not resonate well with viewers. The redesign of Sportsnet was overseen by Dean Bender, who served as the network&#x27;s creative director upon its original launch as CTV Sportsnet.

===2013–2018===
On August 25, 2012, Rogers announced that it would acquire the television assets of Score Media, owners of The Score Television Network (a competing sports network which primarily airs sports news and highlights, alongside event coverage), in a transaction valued at $167 million. The acquisition itself closed on October 19, 2012, at which point Score Media&#x27;s digital assets (including its website and mobile apps) were spun off into another company, theScore Inc., in which Rogers Media would retain a 10% interest. Score Media&#x27;s TV properties were immediately placed into a blind trust, under trustee Peter Viner, pending final CRTC approval. Rogers plans to continue running the network as a sports news service.

The acquisition and Rogers&#x27; proposed amendments (which included a reduction in the frequency of sports updates during live events) were approved by the CRTC on April 30, 2013; the same day, The Score also began to air more Sportsnet-produced programming, including a simulcast of CJCL&#x27;s afternoon show &quot;Tim &amp; Sid&quot; and &quot;Hockey Central Playoff Extra&quot;. However, the CRTC rejected the use of a proposed winter sports competition, the &quot;Sportsnet Winter Games&quot;, for its tangible benefits requirements.

On June 4, 2013, Rogers announced that The Score would be rebranded as a Sportsnet channel; the channel changed its name to Sportsnet 360 on July 1, 2013. As of 2014, Sportsnet is available in 8.2 million Canadian homes.

On October 2, 2018, Scott Moore, Rogers&#x27; head of Sportsnet and NHL properties, stepped down.

==Regional feeds==
Similarly to regional sports networks in the United States, Sportsnet is operated in four regional feeds. While the feeds carry national programming as well, they primarily broadcast sporting events tailored to the region they serve. The four regional feeds are listed in the table below.

All four feeds are available in both standard and high-definition formats. Although cable providers in Canada are permitted to carry only the local Sportsnet feed on analogue cable packages, all four feeds can be carried on digital television services. However, in some instances, programming on the out-of-market Sportsnet feeds, particularly regional NHL games, are blacked out due to league restrictions on teams&#x27; regional broadcast rights. Since the revival of the Winnipeg Jets in 2011, regional Flames and Oilers games on Sportsnet West have also been blacked out in Manitoba, despite it being the &quot;local&quot; Sportsnet feed for that province.

==Programming==

Sportsnet is the main television outlet for Major League Baseball in Canada: it is the exclusive television outlet for the Toronto Blue Jays (which are also owned by Rogers), airing all of its games and other Blue Jays-related programming throughout the season. It also holds Canadian rights to &quot;Fox Saturday Baseball&quot;, the All-Star Game and the postseason (through Fox, TBS and MLB International). Sportsnet also carries other MLB games simulcast from U.S. regional sports networks.

Sportsnet began airing National Football League games Starting with the 2005 season, splitting late games across the Pacific and West feeds, and the East and Ontario feeds. The games not shown in the opposite regions were carried out regionally by City. It also had rights to &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; and the American Thanksgiving games. Sportsnet lost all NFL broadcasting rights for the 2017 season.

Sportsnet carried a large amount of soccer programming; it has been the Canadian broadcaster of the Premier League since 1998 until 2018/19 season (from 2013/14 to 2018/19 season, Sportsnet jointly held Canadian rights to the Premier League with TSN), and also held rights to the FA Cup, UEFA Champions League and Europa League. Sportsnet lost UEFA coverage to TSN for 2015, but gained rights to Bundesliga matches beginning in the 2015–16 season until 2022–23 season. Sportsnet aired the Amway Canadian Championship, an annual competition featuring Canada&#x27;s five professional soccer teams – Toronto FC, CF Montréal, Vancouver Whitecaps FC, FC Edmonton, and Ottawa Fury FC, until TSN acquired full rights in 2017.

In 2006, Sportsnet aired coverage of the FIFA World Cup as part of a consortium with TSN and CTV. From 2011 through 2014, beginning with the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, CBC sub-licensed cable rights to FIFA tournaments to Sportsnet, including the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

On February 8, 2011, Sportsnet announced that it had signed a multi-year deal with Tennis Canada to acquire early round rights to the Rogers Cup. Sportsnet also acquired rights to the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and ATP World Tour 500 series events. As per an extension of Rogers&#x27; sponsorship rights to the tournament, Sportsnet holds sole rights to the Rogers Cup beginning in 2016. In 2016, Sportsnet lost the ATP tours to TSN, but it still maintains exclusive rights to the Rogers Cup, as well as the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.

In February 2013, Sportsnet announced that it would become the official Canadian broadcaster of the IndyCar Series beginning in the 2013 season in a five-year deal with the series. The new contract includes broadcasts on Sportsnet&#x27;s networks and City, and French rights sub-licensed to TVA Sports. That season, Sportsnet also originated coverage from the Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, Indianapolis 500 and Honda Indy Toronto, with Bill Adam, Todd Lewis and Rob Faulds. Canadian driver Paul Tracy joined Sportsnet as an analyst. As of the 2019 season, all but the Honda Indy Toronto and Indianapolis 500 moved exclusively to Sportsnet World and Sportsnet Now+.

In May 2013, Sportsnet reached a six-year deal for rights to the national championships of U Sports (then known as Canadian Interuniversity Sport), including coverage of the Vanier Cup.

===Hockey coverage===
Sportsnet is a major broadcaster of National Hockey League games; the network is the current national cable rightsholder to the league, and regularly airs nationally televised games on Wednesday, Saturday nights as part of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, and Monday nights as part of &quot;Rogers Hometown Hockey&quot;. Sportsnet is also a major regional broadcaster of the NHL; its four regional feeds carry regional telecasts of five of the seven Canadian franchises, including the Toronto Maple Leafs on Sportsnet Ontario (split with TSN4 beginning in 2014–15; Rogers and Bell Canada own a joint, majority stake in the team&#x27;s parent company Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment), the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers on Sportsnet West, and the Vancouver Canucks on Sportsnet Pacific.

In January 2014, Sportsnet lost the Ottawa Senators to TSN, who acquired regional rights to the team in English and French under a 12-year deal, beginning in the 2014–15 season. In September 2014, Sportsnet announced its acquisition of regional English-language television rights to the Montreal Canadiens under a 3-year deal, replacing the Senators on Sportsnet East and succeeding TSN as regional rightsholder, until 2016–17.

Sportsnet held the rights to the Canadian Hockey League under a 12-year deal renewed in the 2014–15 season. Its coverage included a package of national broadcasts from the CHL&#x27;s member leagues, coverage of the CHL Canada/Russia Series and the CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game, along with coverage of the season-ending Memorial Cup tournament. In the 2021–22 season, Sportsnet lost the rights to CBC Sports and TSN, with the latter covering the Memorial Cup.

====National NHL contracts====
From its launch through 2002, Sportsnet was the national cable broadcaster of the NHL in Canada, displacing the rival TSN; it aired a package of Tuesday night games, along with coverage of non-Canadian matchups from the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

On November 26, 2013, Rogers Communications announced that it had reached a 12-year deal to become the exclusive national rightsholder for the National Hockey League, again displacing TSN, along with CBC, a deal which began in the 2014–15 season. Valued at $5.2 billion and covering both television and digital media rights to the league, the value of the contract surpassed the league&#x27;s most recent U.S. rights deal with NBC. Alongside its existing regional rights, Sportsnet now airs &quot;Scotiabank Wednesday Night Hockey&quot;, along with games during &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;.

===Olympics coverage===
In early 2005, Rogers Media and CTVglobemedia jointly acquired broadcast rights to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, as well as the London 2012 Summer Olympics. This was considered a serious coup, as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had consistently won Olympic broadcast rights from the 1996 Summer Olympics through to the 2008 Summer Olympics. CTV and V were the primary broadcasters; Sportsnet, TSN and RDS provided supplementary coverage. Rogers announced in 2011 that it would not bid with CTVglobemedia&#x27;s predecessor Bell Media for the rights to the 2014 and 2016 games, citing scheduling and financial issues.

While Bell Media did attempt to partner with the CBC in 2011 to bid for coverage, CBC reached a deal of its own in August 2012, winning the rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. On February 7, 2013, CBC announced that it had reached deals with Sportsnet and TSN for both networks to become their official cable partners, beginning at the 2014 Winter Olympics. CBC will continue this sub-licensing agreement through the 2020 Summer Olympics.

Sportsnet televised coverage of the 2015 Pan-American Games, also as part of a sub-license with CBC; it aired coverage of the soccer tournaments, as well as a Men&#x27;s basketball semi-final game involving Canada.

==Other services ==
=== Sportsnet+ ===

In 2014, Sportsnet announced the launch of a new TV Everywhere service known as Sportsnet Now, allowing online streaming of the Sportsnet regional channels, Sportsnet One, and Sportsnet 360 for cable subscribers. On March 31, 2016, Rogers announced that Sportsnet Now would be made available as an over-the-top streaming service for cord cutters, initially priced at $24.99 per-month, in addition to remaining available at no additional charge to cable subscribers.

In October 2018, the price was dropped to $19.99, annual subscription options were added, and an additional tier known as Sportsnet Now+ was introduced, adding additional international soccer and rugby events, and out-of-market streaming of regional NHL games for Canadian teams whose rights are owned by Sportsnet. NHL Live, the NHL&#x27;s digital out-of-market sports package, was later added to Sportsnet Now+ in January 2021.

In April 2022, the plan structures were changed; a $24.99 tier was reintroduced which adds WWE Network, while Now+ was replaced with Sportsnet Now Premium, which is priced at $34.99 per-month and includes WWE Network and out-of-market NHL games beginning the 2022–23 season (replacing NHL Live). The service was quietly renamed Sportsnet+ ahead of the 2023–24 NHL season.

===High-definition television===
Sportsnet operates four high-definition feeds, one for each regional channel. Originally, Sportsnet operated one national feed that consisted primarily of a simulcast of Sportsnet Ontario, carrying nationally televised events, or separate content from other regional feeds. That feed was launched on September 1, 2003.

In 2007, Sportsnet began using a second high-definition feed in order to broadcast selected regional NHL games in HD, beginning in the 2007–08 NHL season, activated only in the regions where a game is set to be televised. On January 26, 2009, the national HD feed was replaced by individual HD feeds for each region.

=== 4K ===
On October 5, 2015, Rogers announced that it planned to produce 101 sports telecasts in 4K ultra-high-definition format in 2016, including all Toronto Blue Jays home games, and &quot;marquee&quot; NHL games beginning in January 2016. These broadcasts are offered via a part-time Sportsnet 4K channel on participating television providers.

On January 14, 2016, in cooperation with BT Sport, Sportsnet broadcast the first ever NBA game produced in 4K, and the first live sporting event in 4K in Canadian history—a Toronto Raptors/Orlando Magic game at O2 Arena in London. Sportsnet&#x27;s first domestic 4K telecast, a Toronto Maple Leafs/Montreal Canadiens game, aired January 23, 2016.

<text>The Bir Sreshtho (; ), is the highest military award of Bangladesh. It was awarded to seven freedom fighters who showed utmost bravery and died in action for their nation. They are considered martyrs.

The other three gallantry awards are named, in decreasing order of importance, Bir Uttom, Bir Bikrom and Bir Protik. All of these awards were introduced immediately after the Liberation War in 1971.

==Recipients of the Bir Srestho==
All the recipients of this award were killed in action during the Liberation War of 1971. The award was published by the Bangladesh Gazette on 15 December 1973. It is the highest military award of Bangladesh, similar to the American Medal of Honor or the British Victoria Cross. It has only been given in 1973 to seven people. Listed below are the people who have received the Bir Srestho. They are all considered &#x27;Shaheed&#x27; (Martyrs).

=== Bangladesh Army ===
=== Bangladesh Navy ===
=== Bangladesh Air Force ===
=== Border Guard Bangladesh ===
&quot;Note: When referring to martyrs, the word &#x27;shaheed&#x27; is often put before each individual&#x27;s name as a mark of respect. The list has been prepared like the declaration by the Bangladesh Gazette.

<text>A hot hatch (shortened from hot hatchback) is a high-performance variant of a hatchback car. The term originated in the mid-1980s; however, sportier factory versions of hatchbacks have been produced since the 1970s. A front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout that uses petrol for fuel is the most common choice of powertrain, however all-wheel drive has become more commonly used since around 2010. Most hot hatches are of European or Asian origin.

==Etymology==
Usage of the term &quot;hot hatchback&quot; began in the United Kingdom in 1983, which was shortened to &quot;hot hatch&quot; in 1984. The term first appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1985, and is now commonly and widely accepted as a mainstream, albeit informal, term. It is retrospectively applied to cars from the late 1970s but was not a phrase used at the time. While hot hatches generally come with two-box designs, three-box/sloped liftback designs are not unheard of, with some of them crossing into sports sedan territory.
Due to the historical scarcity of hatchback cars in the United States, the term hot hatch is not widely used in the US.

Since the 1990s and 2000s, the term warm hatch has been used to describe sporting hatchback models that are slower than a hot hatch (i.e. a &quot;junior&quot; version of a hot hatch). Examples include the Mini Cooper (which sits below the Mini Cooper S), Peugeot 207 GT (which sits below the Peugeot 207 GTi) Suzuki Swift Sport, and Toyota Yaris SR.

== History ==

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
The 1961 Mini Cooper was one of the first performance cars to use a small body and an FF layout, both key characteristics of a hot hatchback. However, the Mini was not produced in a hatchback body style until 2001 and is therefore not considered a hot hatch.

The first car to meet the criteria of a hot hatch, the AMC Gremlin, was introduced in the United States on April 1, 1970. Promoted as &quot;America&#x27;s first subcompact&quot;, it came standard with a 3.3 L straight-six engine with an optional 3.8 L upgrade. By the 1972 model year it was available with a 5 L V-8 engine. The manufacturer described the Gremlin as &quot;a pal to its friends and an ogre to its enemies,&quot; emphasizing its performance and radical design in comparison to other cars in its class. Compared to the Volkswagen Beetle, it was two inches longer, achieved comparable fuel economy, and sold for $1 less in the eastern US, though its base engine delivered 128 horsepower, more than twice that of the German subcompact.

The first European hot hatch was the Autobianchi A112 Abarth, introduced in September 1971. It was prepared by the motorsports division of the Fiat Group, at first with a 982 cc engine, obtained by increasing the stroke, coupled to a sporting exhaust, a twin-choke carburetor, and a different camshaft.

In 1973, the Simca 1100 Ti was launched. It had its power increased by 40% to 82 hp (61 kW), which resulted in a 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) time of under 12 seconds and a top speed of 105 mph (169 km/h). Other upgrades included front disc brakes, front and rear spoilers and alloy wheels. The Alfa Romeo Alfasud Ti was launched in the same year. Along with a 5-speed gearbox, it featured a more powerful version of the standard 1.2 litre engine, brought to 68 PS (50 kW; 67 hp) by adopting a Weber twin-choke carburettor, allowing the small saloon to reach 160 km/h (99 mph).

The Renault 5 Alpine (called Gordini in the United Kingdom), which went on sale in May 1976. It had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in under 10 seconds.

The car credited with establishing the popularity of hot hatches is the Volkswagen Golf GTI, which was announced at the 1975 Frankfurt Motor Show. and released in July 1976. The Golf GTI was originally designated to be sold only in West Germany, but from 1977 Volkswagen began exports of the (left-hand drive only) GTI. Production of right-hand drive GTI&#x27;s began in 1979.

The Renault 5 Alpine and Volkswagen Golf GTI, with the addition of a more powerful engine, sharper handling, distinctive body styling with additional spoilers and alloy wheels, helped create the birth of a huge market for small, practical hatchback cars with performance to match contemporary coupes such as the Ford Capri 2.0, Lancia Beta Coupe 2000 and Renault 17 TS. With top speeds above , the Alpine and GTI enjoyed a short run of unparalleled sales success until the early 1980s.

There were two hot hatches created specifically for competition. In 1978, Vauxhall created the Chevette HS and HSR by fitting the 2.3 litre slant-four engine, using a 16-valve cylinder head. Fitted with two Stromberg carburettors the engine developed 135 bhp (the HSR developed 150 bhp). In 1979, Chrysler developed the Lotus Sunbeam which used the Lotus 1973 cc 16V slant four engine. Power output of and a 0-60 mph time of 6.6 seconds. Despite being rear-wheel drive, the Sunbeam is considered a hot hatch.

=== 1980s ===
Until the early 1980s, the Volkswagen Golf Mk1 GTI and the Renault 5 Alpine/Gordini dominated the retrospectively named hot hatch market segment in many European markets.

From around 1984, the market for hatchbacks with sportier performance grew, and many manufacturers added a hot hatch variant to their range. Power increases were achieved through upgraded carburettors (e.g. the Ford Fiesta XR2), fuel injection (e.g. the Peugeot 205 GTI), turbocharging (e.g. the Renault 5 GT Turbo), supercharging (e.g. the Polo G40) or fitting larger engines (e.g. the 2.0 litre Fiat Ritmo/Strada Abarth 130 TC). Other significant hot hatches of the 1980s include the Ford Escort RS Turbo, Opel Kadett GTE (also known as Vauxhall Astra GTE), Renault 11 Turbo, Lancia Delta HF Integrale (all-wheel drive), Citroën AX GT and Suzuki Swift GTi.

By the end of the 1980s, the hot hatch was hugely popular in Europe, and was pushing into other worldwide markets. The brief heyday of Group B rallying pushed the hot hatch genre to its limits, and small numbers of ultra-high performance variants were manufactured to comply with the rally rules (often termed &quot;homologation specials&quot;). These vehicles represented a brief, extreme branch of the hot hatch, and included such notable vehicles as the Lancia Delta S4, MG Metro 6R4 and Peugeot 205 T16.
=== 1990s ===
European manufacturers continued to produce hot hatches through the 1990s, including the Ford Fiesta RS Turbo, Ford Escort RS Cosworth, Peugeot 106 Rallye / GTi, Peugeot 306 GTi-6 / Rallye, Renault Clio Williams, SEAT Ibiza GTi / GT 16v / Cupra, Volkswagen Golf GTI / VR6 and Ford Focus ST170.

Japanese manufacturers also began to produce hot hatches, including the Honda Civic Type R, Mazda 323 GT-R, Nissan Pulsar GTI-R, Suzuki Swift GTi and Toyota Corolla GTi.
=== 2000s ===
Hot hatches continued to get faster through the 2000s, with an increasing number of models using turbocharged engines. During the 2000s manufacturers started to emphasise the sub-brand of their hot hatch derivatives such as Renault&#x27;s Renault Sport, Opel&#x27;s OPC, Vauxhall&#x27;s VXR and Fiat&#x27;s Abarth.

European-built hot hatches from the 2000s include the Abarth Grande Punto, Alfa Romeo 147 GTA, Audi S3, 
Ford Fiesta ST,
Ford Focus ST/RS,
MG ZR,
Mini Cooper S/JCW,
Opel/Vauxhall Astra SRi Turbo/OPC/VXR,
Peugeot 206 RC/207 GTi,
Renault Clio RS/Mégane RS,
SEAT León Cupra/FR+SEAT Ibiza Cupra/FR and
Volkswagen Golf GTI/Golf R. Asian-built hot hatches included the Honda Civic Type R,Mazdaspeed 3, and Proton Satria GTi.

=== 2010s ===
Although all-wheel drive system has been made available for hot hatches since the 1980s, further increases to power outputs saw more adoption of the drivetrain on several hot hatches in the 2010s, such as the 2010 Volkswagen Golf R, 2011 Audi RS 3, 2013 Mercedes-Benz A 45 AMG, and the 2015 Ford Focus RS. With these models expanding the definition of hot hatches from front-wheel drive to also include all-wheel drive, the hatchback versions of the Subaru Impreza WRX/STI that have been produced at various times could be considered to be hot hatches. However, the WRX/STI is generally considered a compact saloon (to rival the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution), rather than a hot hatch.

The majority of hot hatches continued with the traditional front-wheel drive layout, with many models producing in excess of 
and the Ford Focus RS 500 producing . The BMW M135i/M140i is a rare example of a rear-wheel drive hot hatch from the 2010s.

Another technical development for hot hatches since 2010 is the increasing use of dual-clutch transmissions.

The W177 Mercedes-AMG A 45 S, which was introduced in 2019, is the first mass-produced hot hatch that exceeded the border, with its &quot;M139&quot; engine producing .

== Asia ==

Japanese-built hot hatches include the 1982 Honda City Turbo, 1984 Isuzu Piazza XS Turbo, 1986 Suzuki Cultus GTi, 1988 Nissan March Super Turbo, 1988 Toyota Corolla GTi (AE92), 1989 Daihatsu Charade GTti, 1990 Toyota Starlet GT Turbo, 1992 Mazda 323 GT-R, 1992 Mitsubishi Mirage Cyborg R, 1994 Nissan Pulsar GTI-R, 1995 Nissan Pulsar VZ-R N1, 1996 Toyota Starlet Glanza, 1997 Honda Civic Type R, 1999 Toyota Yaris TS, 2004 Toyota Corolla TS, 2005 Suzuki Swift Sport, 2006 Mitsubishi Colt Ralliart Version-R, 2007 Mazdaspeed3, 2008 Subaru Impreza WRX STI hatchback, 2020 Toyota GR Yaris.

South Korean manufacturers began to produce hot hatches in 2013 with the Kia Pro_Cee&#x27;d GT. Hyundai&#x27;s first hot hatch, the i30 N, was released in 2017 and was awarded Best Hot Hatch at the 2018 UK Car of the Year Awards. The Veloster N was released in 2019 and was awarded the 2020 Performance Car of the Year by Road and Track Magazine. 

==North America==
In the 1980s, hot hatches built by Ford in the United States include the 1983 Escort GT (and its twin the Mercury Lynx XR3),
Chrysler hot hatches include the 1984 Dodge Omni GLH (&quot;Goes Like Hell&quot;) and the
1986 Shelby GLHS (&quot;Goes Like Hell S&#x27;more&quot;).
General Motors produced the 1986 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24,
1986 Pontiac Sunbird GT
and 1987 Buick Skyhawk Sport Hatch with rear hatches, however these are &quot;hatchback coupes&quot;, rather than traditional utilitarian hatchbacks.

More recent North American hot hatches include the 2002 Ford Focus SVT,

<doc id="377641" wikidata="Q7359286" url="?curid=377641" title="Rogers Hi-Speed Internet">
<text>Rogers Hi-Speed Internet is a broadband Internet service provider in Canada, owned by Rogers Communications. Rogers previously operated under the brand names [[@Home Network|Rogers@Home]], Rogers Yahoo! Hi-Speed Internet, WAVE, and Road Runner in Newfoundland. It is currently the second largest Internet provider in Canada, after Bell Internet by customer count.

== History ==

===1990s: Early years===
Rogers&#x27; started high speed internet service as a way to aid remote workers.

The Rogers&#x27; cable home Internet network was first launched on November 28, 1995 and was available to about 16,000 homes in Newmarket, Ontario. The service was branded WAVE. It was North America&#x27;s first cable Internet service.

===2000s: Growth and relationship with Yahoo!===
By the year 2000, the service was rebranded to Rogers@Home and availability was extended to more cities in Ontario and British Columbia.

In 2004, Rogers partnered with Yahoo! to offer Rogers Yahoo! Hi-Speed Internet to its members. This included service offers unlimited e-mail storage, plus access to Premium Yahoo! Services at no charge, including a Flickr PRO account. Customers with websites previously hosted by Rogers were offered the option of transferring to ca.geocities.com addresses. (Unike regular GeoCities websites, these were ad-free for existing accounts, although those for new customers had drop-down ads.) All such websites were discontinued with the closure of GeoCities on 27 October 2009. Although still partnered with Yahoo!, Rogers dropped Yahoo! from its services name in 2008.

In mid-2009, Rogers discontinued giving free Flickr Pro accounts to all Rogers customers and switched all accounts to the free version while allowing old pictures and videos to be stored even though it was over the allowed limit. Rogers Mail accounts continue to be provided by Yahoo!.

=== 2010-present: DOCSIS 3, fibre to the home (FTTH) and price increases ===
On January 16, 2012, customer advocacy blog Stop The Cap! reported that Rogers increased the price of all its cable Internet services by $2, except for Lite and Ultra-Lite which remain unchanged. Rogers blames its slightly higher cap limits and its SpeedBoost technology as reasons for the price increase. A customer, however, was quick to point out that the cable company &quot;introduced &#x27;SpeedBoost&#x27; as a &#x27;free&#x27; feature which we are now apparently/effectively going to pay more for&quot;.

A few days later, Stop The Cap! reported that DOCSIS 3.0 customers would benefit from a speed and usage increase. By February 21, Express speeds of up to 12 Mbit/s would now be up to 18 Mbit/s, while Extreme speeds of up to 24 Mbit/s would be increased to 28 Mbit/s. Also, Ultimate speeds of up to 50 Mbit/s would now be up to 75 Mbit/s. On March 8, data allowances for each plan would be increased by 10 GB and 20 GB, respectively. In August 2012, Rogers doubled speeds on its Lite plan from 3 Mbit/s to 6 Mbit/s. It also increased its usage caps from 15 GB to 20 GB.

On August 1, 2012, Rogers started the availability of an unadvertised Ultimate tier which offers 150 Mbit/s of download speed and 10 Mbit/s of upload speed. Currently being implemented within the GTA area, the company plans to extend this service&#x27;s availability to the rest of Ontario by the end of 2012. Customers with the older Ultimate tier will be informed when the new tier is available.

Rogers introduced fibre to the home (FTTH) residential internet service in 2012. It is only available is select areas of Toronto, ON and Moncton, NB.

In March 2015, Rogers introduced a streamlined package structure, known as Rogers Ignite. The Ignite packages are aimed primarily towards streaming media, with the majority of the packages offering no usage caps. In October 2015, Rogers launched Ignite Gigabit Internet, which supports 4K resolution streaming to Rogers Cable NextBox 4K receivers.

In November 2015, Rogers launched a Fido-branded home internet service in its Ontario markets, offering a 30 Mbit/s package with a 300 GB bandwidth cap, and discounts for Fido mobile customers.

==Services==
Rogers offers cable Internet using the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standard. They also offer value-added services such as Internet security computer software.

===Cable Internet===
Cable Internet from Rogers is branded as &quot;Hybrid Fibre&quot;, to indicate that on the coaxial cable in customers&#x27; homes, the frequencies used for Internet service are separate from those used for Rogers&#x27; cable television service. Available at a variety of speeds, from Lite (10 Mbit/s down, 1 Mbit/s up) to Ultimate (250 Mbit/s down, 20 Mbit/s up) tiers. Rogers Hi-Speed Internet Ultimate Fibre&#x27;s speeds are 350 Mbit/s down and 350 Mbit/s up. Rogers Hi-Speed Ultimate and Ultimate Fibre&#x27;s usage caps had been increased dramatically to 1 TB/month and 2 TB/month respectively.

Those who do not subscribe to television services from Rogers cannot access most analog cable channels. Channels 2 to 6, however, can be legally watched without a subscription. These channels are also available over the air, with the exception of the TV guide on channel 4.

Rogers Hi-Speed Internet users may be warned, through their browser via Rogers-injected code, that they have reached 75% or 100% of their monthly limit. This message explains that there will be charges for additional usage after the 100% warning for exceeding their limit. The overcharge fees are charged on a per-gigabyte basis, rounded down to the nearest gigabyte. Overage costs as low as $0.50 for the high-end Ultimate plan, but costs as much as $4.00 for the low-end Lite plan. All plans except for Lite are DOCSIS 3.0 compatible.

===Fibre Internet (FTTH)===
Rogers confirmed that it is using fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) to power a new broadband service tier that provides upload and download speeds of up to 350 Mbit/s (symmetric). The tier, called Rogers Ultimate Fibre Internet, is currently available only in parts of Toronto and the MSO&#x27;s Atlantic region, which includes Moncton. According to Rogers, this is not a beta but in fact a first market rollout of fibre to the home service; meaning rogers is likely to expand this to other areas. The service comes with a monthly 2-terabyte usage limit. Pricing is listed at $225.99 CAD per month as of October 30, 2013. This new service is based on GPON.

===Security===
While previously offering Norton Internet Security, Rogers switched to offering Rogers Online Protection. It contains anti-virus/spyware, parent/privacy control and firewall features. A cutoff time of June 30, 2009 was set for people to switch from their previous protections to this new one.

The security suite is distributed for free with basic services, such as antivirus, antispyware, firewall, and parental controls, while premium services, at an additional cost, include PC optimizing tools, identity theft protection, wireless security services, and backup services. The security suite only supports Microsoft Windows operating systems.

===Legacy services===

Rogers previously offered a Portable Internet service in select rural regions, similarly to its competitor Bell Internet. These services used the Inukshuk Wireless network. The company is no longer accepting subscriptions to this service, as they plan to discontinue the service on March 1, 2012. Customers are encouraged to use Rogers Wireless Internet services instead, which generally offer a much lower bandwidth cap.

==Criticism ==
Rogers has been criticised for traffic redirection and inspection. They use deep packet inspection to identify and throttle BitTorrent traffic. and use website address errors (failed DNS lookups) to redirect traffic to their search portal. They have also made a controversial move to display advertisements in webmail despite users having to pay for the service (usually in paid web-apps, there is no advertising).

===Throttling===
BitTorrent traffic was restricted through bandwidth throttling using the SCE-2020, and in later years, the SCE-8000 from Cisco Systems Inc, which had caused complaints as users felt Rogers was overstepping their bounds as a service provider and despite Rogers advertising their service &quot;for sharing large files and much more&quot;. Rogers had previously denied such allegations, despite widespread reports of the issue. Further controversy arose when in May 2007, Rogers began throttling all encrypted file transfers allegedly to combat BitTorrent traffic, but affecting all encrypted transfers regardless if they are BitTorrent traffic or not.
In January 2011, the CRTC issued a letter to Rogers stating it was breaking CRTC policy by not &quot;indicat[ing] that there are circumstances whereby the Rogers ITMP will also affect download speeds available to subscribers.&quot;
 Despite the letter from the CRTC, Rogers still had not updated their policy pages as of February 4, 2011, and continued throttling all non-whitelisted internet traffic (no longer just P2P) for up to 15 minutes after P2P had been disabled. Several games had been caught up in this more restrictive throttling as Rogers was incorrectly detecting them as P2P, and had also been slow to fix it despite offers of assistance from customers, and game manufacturers.
On May 31, 2011, Rogers filed that they had resolved the World of Warcraft throttling, however they had only resolved it on their testing equipment, as users were still experiencing throttling. This resulted in the CRTC ordering testing done by Rogers, and the CRTC providing the complainant (Teresa Murphy) a redacted copy of the Rogers testing. On September 22, 2011, the CRTC released Telecom Information Bulletin CRTC 2011-609, which set out new steps for complaints, and allowed for the World of Warcraft complaint to be sent to the CRTC Enforcements division. While the World of Warcraft complaint was then closed as it was resolved, the creators of the WoW complaint created a new one, which was then sent to Enforcements division, who then began looking into Rogers&#x27; throttling practices, and found additional 
non-compliance.

After Bell announced they were ending throttling in December 2011, and the CRTC Enforcement division finding another violation of CRTC throttling policy in January 2012, Rogers announced on Feb 6, 2012 that they were ending throttling on their network by the end of 2012.

===Injection of content===
Since early December, 2007, Rogers has been injecting their own content into other companies&#x27; websites without permission. Rogers users who are close to their maximum data cap in their internet plan of choice are seeing red text appear above the content of every website they visit. The notice continues to appear on every page until the user either clicks a link acknowledging that they have seen the message or chooses to opt out of the notification.

<doc id="377646" wikidata="Q3643110" url="?curid=377646" title="Hokey Pokey">
<text>The Hokey Pokey (also known as Hokey Cokey in the United Kingdom, Ireland, some parts of Australia, and the Caribbean) is a participation dance with a distinctive accompanying tune and lyric structure. It is well-known in English-speaking countries. It originates in a British folk dance, with variants attested as early as 1826. The song and accompanying dance peaked in popularity as a music hall song and novelty dance in the mid-1940s in the UK. The song became a chart hit twice in the 1980s. The first UK hit was by The Snowmen, which peaked at UK No. 18 in 1981.

==Origins and meaning==
Despite several claims of a recent invention, numerous variants of the song exist with similar dances and lyrics dating back to the 19th century. One of the earlier variants, with a very similar dance to the modern one, is found in Robert Chambers&#x27; &quot;Popular Rhymes of Scotland&quot; from 1842.
The words there are given as:

A later variant of this song is the Shakers&#x27; song &quot;Hinkum-Booby&quot;, which had more similar lyrics to the modern song and was published in Edward Deming Andrews&#x27; &quot;A gift to be simple&quot; in 1940: (page 42).

A song rendered (&quot;with appropriate gestures&quot;) by two sisters from Canterbury, England, United Kingdom, while on a visit in 1857 to Bridgewater, New Hampshire, United States, starts as an &quot;English/Scottish ditty&quot; in this way:

As the song continues, the &quot;left hand&quot; is put in, then the &quot;right foot&quot;, then the &quot;left foot&quot;, then &quot;my whole head&quot; . . . [I]t does not seem to have been much used in Shaker societies.

A version known as &quot;Ugly Mug&quot; is described in 1872:

A version from c. 1891 from the town of Golspie, Scotland, was published by Edward W. B. Nicholson:

In the 1892 book, &quot;English Folk-Rhymes&quot;, a version of the song originating from Sheffield, England, is given:

Some early versions of this song thus show a marked resemblance to the modern song &quot;Looby (or Loopty) Loo&quot;, and the songs have been described as having a common origin.

In the book &quot;Charming Talks about People and Places&quot;, published around 1900, there is a song with music entitled &quot;Turn The Right Hand In&quot; (page 163). It has nine verses, which run as: &quot;Turn the right hand in, turn the right hand out, give your hands a very good shake, and turn your body around&quot;. Additional verses include v2. left hand...; v3. both hands...; v4. right foot...; v5. left foot...; v6. both feet...; v7. right cheek...; v8. left cheek...; and, v9. both cheeks... The tune is not the same as the later popular version of the Hokey Cokey, but the last verse of the lyrics is more similar as it states to &quot;turn your body around&quot;. No author, composer or lyricist was credited there.

In recent times various other claims about the origins of the song have arisen, but they are all contradicted by the evidence of the publication history. One of these accounts tells that in 1940, during The Blitz in the Second World War, when Nazi Germany was bombarding London, a Canadian officer suggested to Al Tabor, a British bandleader of the 1920s–1940s, that he could write a party song with moves similar to &quot;Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree&quot;. The inspiration for the song&#x27;s title that resulted, &quot;The Hokey Pokey&quot;, supposedly came from an ice cream vendor whom Tabor had heard as a boy, calling out &quot;Hokey Pokey penny a lump. Have a lick make you jump&quot;. A well-known lyricist/songwriter/music publisher of the time, Jimmy Kennedy, reneged on a financial agreement to promote and publish it, and finally Tabor settled out of court, giving up all rights to the number.

In 2008, an Anglican cleric, Canon Matthew Damon, provost of Wakefield Cathedral, West Yorkshire, claimed that the dance movements were a parody of the traditional Catholic Latin Mass. Up until the reforms of Vatican II, the priest performed his movements facing the altar rather than the congregation, who could not hear the words very well, nor understand the Latin, nor clearly see his movements. At one point the priest would say &quot;Hoc est corpus meum&quot;, Latin for &quot;This is My body&quot; (a phrase that has also been suggested as the origin of the similar-sounding stereotypical magician&#x27;s phrase &quot;hocus-pocus&quot;). That theory led Scottish politician Michael Matheson in 2008 to urge police action &quot;against individuals who use it [the song and dance] to taunt Catholics&quot;. Matheson&#x27;s claim was deemed ridiculous by fans from both sides of the Old Firm (the rival Glasgow football teams Celtic and Rangers) and calls were made on fans&#x27; forums for both sides to join together to sing the song on 27 December 2008 at Ibrox Stadium. Close relatives of Jimmy Kennedy and Al Tabor have publicly stated their recollections of the origin and meaning of Hokey Cokey, and have denied its connection to the Mass or to an imitation of it. Relatives&#x27; accounts differ, but they all agree on the fact that the song existed and was published decades before its supposed composition in the 1940s.

==Dance across the world==
===Australia===
In Australia, the dance may be called the &quot;hokey pokey&quot; or the &quot;hokey cokey.&quot; It was a hit for Johnny Chester &amp; The Chessmen in 1961.

===Denmark===
Mostly performed in the British style of the dance, it is known as the &quot;boogie woogie&quot; (pronounced ).

===Germany===
Performed mainly in the carnival in a variation of the British style of the dance, it is known as &quot;Rucki-Zucki&quot;.

===Mexico===
Released as a commercial recording by Tatiana (singer) as &quot;Hockey-Pockey&quot;.

===New Zealand===
In the North Island, the dance is usually known as the &quot;hokey tokey&quot;, or the &quot;hokey cokey&quot; because hokey pokey is the usual term for honeycomb toffee. In the South Island it&#x27;s just The Hokey Pokey.

=== United Kingdom ===
Known as the &quot;hokey cokey&quot; or the &quot;hokey kokey&quot;, the song and accompanying dance peaked in popularity as a music hall song and novelty dance in the mid-1940s in Britain.

There is a claim of authorship by the British/Irish songwriter Jimmy Kennedy, responsible for the lyrics to popular songs such as the wartime &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Hang out the Washing on the Siegfried Line&quot; and the children&#x27;s song &quot;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot;. Sheet music copyrighted in 1942 and published by Campbell Connelly &amp; Co Ltd, agents for Kennedy Music Co Ltd, styles the song as &quot;the Cokey Cokey&quot;.

In the 1973 Thames Television documentary, &quot;May I Have the Pleasure?&quot;, about the Hammersmith Palais de Danse, Lou Preager comments on how his was the first band to record the &#x27;Okey Cokey&#x27;.

EMI Gold released a Monsta Mash CD featuring the &quot;Monsta Hokey Cokey&quot; written and produced by Steve Deakin-Davies of &quot;The Ambition Company&quot;.

The song was used by comedian Bill Bailey during his &quot;Part Troll&quot; tour, however, it was reworked by Bailey into a style of the German electronic group Kraftwerk, including quasi-German lyrics and Kraftwerk&#x27;s signature robotic dance moves.

The comedy act Ida Barr, a fictional East End pensioner who mashes up music hall songs with rap numbers, almost always finishes her shows with the hokey cokey, performed over a thumping RnB backing. Ida Barr is performed by a British comedian Christopher Green.

===United States and Canada===
Known as the &quot;hokey pokey&quot;, it became popular in the US in the 1950s. Its originator in the US is debatable:
*Larry LaPrise, Charles Macak, and Tafit Baker of the musical group the Ram Trio, better known as the Sun Valley Trio, recorded the song in 1948 and it was released in 1950. They have generally been credited with creating this novelty dance as entertainment for the ski crowd at the Sun Valley, Idaho resort. 
*However, two club musicians from Scranton, Pennsylvania, Robert Degen and Joseph P. Brier, had previously copyrighted a very similar song, &quot;The Hokey Pokey Dance&quot;, in 1944. (One account says that copyright was granted in 1946.) According to Degan&#x27;s son in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Degan and Brier wrote the song while playing for the summer at a resort near the Delaware Water Gap. Degan resided at Richmond Place Rehabilitation and Health Center in Lexington, Kentucky, until he died on November 23, 2009, aged 104. 
*Degen and Brier, who died in 1991, sued the members of the Ram Trio, and several record companies and music publishers for copyright infringement, demanding $200,000 in damages and $1 for each record of the LaPrise &quot;Hokey Pokey&quot;. The suit was settled out of court. LaPrise later sold the rights to his version to country-western music star Roy Acuff&#x27;s Nashville publishing company, Acuff-Rose Music; that company was sold to Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2002.
*A competing authorship claim is made by or on behalf of British bandleader Gerry Hoey from around 1940, under the title &quot;The Hoey Oka&quot;.

In 1953, Ray Anthony&#x27;s big band recording of the song turned it into a nationwide sensation. The distinctive vocal was by singer Jo Ann Greer, who simultaneously sang with the Les Brown band and dubbed the singing voices for such film stars as Rita Hayworth, Kim Novak, June Allyson, and Esther Williams. (She also charted with Anthony later the same year with the song &quot;Wild Horses&quot;.) 

In 1978, Mike Stanglin produced a &quot;skating version&quot; of the Hokey Pokey, for use in skating rinks.

==Dance moves==
===British and Irish style of dance===
The instruction set goes as follows:
&lt;poem&gt;
Come on Robert, HERE WE GO!
You put your [left leg] in,
Your [left leg] out:
In, out, In, out
Shake it all about.
You do the hokey cokey,
And you turn around.
That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about!
&lt;/poem&gt;

On &quot;You do the hokey cokey&quot;, each participant joins their right and left hands at the fingertips to make a chevron and rocks the chevron from side to side. After that the participants separately, but in time with the others, turn around (usually clockwise when viewed from above – novices may go in the opposite direction to the main group, but this adds more hilarity to this joyous, novelty dance). The hands are either still joined together or moved as in a jogging motion – dependent on local tradition or individual choice.

Each instruction set is followed by a chorus, entirely different from other parts of the world. There is either a caller, within or outside the group, or the instructions are called by the whole group – which can add to the confusion and is laughed off as part of the dance&#x27;s charm and amusement.

&lt;poem&gt;
Whoa, the hokey cokey
Whoa, the hokey cokey
Whoa, the hokey cokey
Knees bend, arms stretch, 
Rah, rah, rah! &lt;/poem&gt;

The first three lines of this chorus are sometimes rendered &#x27;Whoa, the hokey cokey&#x27;, with the &#x27;whoa&#x27; lasting three beats instead of two. It can also be said &quot;Whoa, the hokey cokey cokey&quot;.

For this chorus, all participants stand in a circle and hold hands: on each &quot;Whoa&quot; they raise their joined hands in the air and run in toward the centre of the circle, and on &quot;...the hokey cokey&quot; they run backwards out again. This instruction and chorus are repeated for the other limb, then for the upper right, and then the upper left arm. Either the upper or lower limbs may start first, and either left or right, depending on local tradition, or by random choice on the night. On the penultimate line they bend their knees then stretch their arms, as indicated, and on &quot;Rah, rah, rah!&quot; they either clap in time or raise their arms above their heads and push upwards in time. Sometimes each subsequent verse and chorus is a little faster and louder, with the ultimate aim of making people chaotically run into each other in gleeful abandon. There is a final instruction set with &quot;you put your whole self in, etc&quot;, cramming the centre of the dance floor.

Often, the final chorus is sung twice, the second time even faster and the song ends with the joyous chant, &#x27;aye tiddly aye tie, brown bread!&#x27;.

===American and Australian style of dance===
The dance follows the instructions given in the lyrics of the song, which may be prompted by a bandleader, a participant, or a recording. A sample instruction sequence would be:

&lt;poem&gt;
You put your [right leg] in,
You put your [right leg] out;
You put your [right leg] in,
And you shake it all about.
You do the hokey pokey,
And you turn (yourself) around.
That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Participants stand in a circle. On &quot;in&quot; they put the appropriate body part in the circle, and on &quot;out&quot; they put it out of the circle. On &quot;And you shake it all about&quot;, the body part is shaken three times (on &quot;shake&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, and &quot;-bout&quot;, respectively). Throughout &quot;You do the hokey pokey, / And you turn yourself around&quot;, the participants spin in a complete circle with the arms raised at 90° angles and the index fingers pointed up, shaking their arms up and down and their hips side to side seven times (on &quot;do&quot;, &quot;hoke-&quot;, &quot;poke-&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;turn&quot;, &quot;-self&quot;, and &quot;-round&quot; respectively). For the final &quot;That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about&quot;, the participants clap with their hands out once on &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;what&quot; each, clap under the knee with the leg lifted up on &quot;all&quot;, clap behind the back on &quot;a-&quot;, and finally one more clap with the arms out on &quot;-bout&quot;.

The body parts usually included are, in order, &quot;right foot&quot;, &quot;left foot&quot;, &quot;right hand&quot;, &quot;left hand&quot;, &quot;head&quot;, &quot;buttocks&quot; (or &quot;backside&quot;), fingers, toes, hair, lips, tongue and &quot;whole self&quot;; the body parts &quot;right elbow&quot;, &quot;left elbow&quot;, &quot;right hip&quot;, and &quot;left hip&quot; are often included as well.

In Australia, the song has a chorus similar to the British version in melody, but does not involve running into the centre of the circle; unlike in the UK, the Australian version of the dance is not necessarily performed in a circle.

&lt;poem&gt;
Woah, the hokey pokey,
Woah, the hokey pokey,
Woah, the hokey pokey.
That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about!
&lt;/poem&gt;

On each &quot;pokey&quot;, the participants again raise the arms at 90° angles with the index fingers pointed up, shaking their arms up and down and their hips side to side five times.

* A portion of the song was danced by the Bay of Pigswatch cast in &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; episode 204.
* In the final episode of &quot;Bojack Horseman&quot;, &quot;Nice While It Lasted&quot;, Todd Chavez and Bojack Horseman discuss the meaning of life by using the Hokey-Pokey as a metaphor. Todd observes that most people think the song (and life) is about &#x27;the Hokey-Pokey&#x27;, where as he believes differently and observes &quot;It&#x27;s like the song says. You do the Hokey-Pokey and you turn yourself around. &#x27;You turn yourself around!&#x27;; that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about!&quot; - Implying that life isn&#x27;t about &#x27;the Hokey-Pokey&#x27; parts of life, but that it&#x27;s about making changes and fixing mistakes. Bojack Horseman gives little credit to the song and quips &quot;Yeah, I don&#x27;t know if the song writers put that much thought into the existential significance of the lyrics; they literally rhyme &#x27;about&#x27; with &#x27;about&#x27;.&quot;
* This song was used as the &quot;song of the week&quot; in a 1988 week on Polka Dot Door

<text>Renata Tebaldi ( , ; 1 February 1922 – 19 December 2004) was an Italian lirico-spinto soprano popular in the post-war period, and especially prominent as one of the stars of La Scala, San Carlo and, especially, the Metropolitan Opera. Often considered among the great opera singers of the 20th century, she focused primarily on the &quot;verismo&quot; roles of the lyric and dramatic repertoires. Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini called her voice &quot;&quot; (&quot;the voice of an angel&quot;), and La Scala music director Riccardo Muti called her &quot;one of the greatest performers with one of the most extraordinary voices in the field of opera.&quot;

==Early years and education==

Born in Pesaro, Tebaldi was the daughter of cellist Teobaldo Tebaldi and Giuseppina Barbieri, a nurse. Her parents separated before her birth and Tebaldi grew up with her mother in her maternal grandparents&#x27; home in Langhirano.

Stricken with polio at the age of three, Tebaldi became interested in music and sang with the church choir in Langhirano. Her mother sent her, at age 13, for piano lessons with Giuseppina Passani in Parma, who took the initiative that Tebaldi study voice with Italo Brancucci at the Parma Conservatory. She was admitted to the conservatory at 17, where she studied with Brancucci and Ettore Campogalliani. She later transferred to Liceo musicale Rossini in Pesaro, taking lessons with Carmen Melis, and on her suggestion with Giuseppe Pais. She then studied with Beverley Peck Johnson in New York City.

==Italian career==

Tebaldi made her stage debut as Elena in Boito&#x27;s &quot;Mefistofele&quot; in Rovigo in 1944. Wartime conditions made for a difficult trip, with Tebaldi partly travelling by horse cart to Rovigo, and her return trip coming under machine-gun fire. Her early career was also marked by a performance in Parma in &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot; and &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;. She caused a stir when in 1946 she made her debut as Desdemona in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; alongside Francesco Merli as the title role in Trieste.

Her major breakthrough came in 1946 when she auditioned for Arturo Toscanini, who says she had the &quot;voce d&#x27;angelo&quot; (voice of an angel). Tebaldi made her La Scala debut that year at the concert marking the reopening of the theatre after World War II. She sang the &quot;Prayer&quot; (&quot;Dal tuo stellato soglio&quot;) from Rossini&#x27;s biblical opera, &quot;Mosè in Egitto&quot;, and the soprano part in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum&quot;.

She was given the roles of Margherita and Elena in &quot;Mefistofele&quot; and Elsa in &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in 1946. The next year she appeared in &quot;La bohème&quot; and as Eva in &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;. Toscanini encouraged her to sing the role of Aida and invited her to rehearse it in his studio. She believed the role was reserved for a dramatic soprano, but Toscanini convinced her otherwise, and she debuted in the role at La Scala in 1950 with Mario del Monaco and Fedora Barbieri, conducted by Antonino Votto. It was the greatest success in her budding career and led to international opportunities. During the first decade of her career, Tebaldi&#x27;s repertoire included roles by Rossini, Spontini, Handel, Mozart, Wagner, Gounod, Mascagni, Tchaikovsky and contemporary composers such as Refice, Casavola and Cilea.

Tebaldi provided Sophia Loren&#x27;s singing in the film version of &quot;Aida&quot; (1953).

==International career==

Tebaldi went on a concert tour with the La Scala ensemble in 1950, first to the Edinburgh Festival and then to London, where she made her debut as Desdemona in two performances of &quot;Otello&quot; at the Royal Opera House and in the Verdi Requiem, both conducted by Victor de Sabata.

===The Met===

Tebaldi made her American debut in 1950 as Aida at the San Francisco Opera; her Metropolitan Opera debut took place on 31 January 1955, as Desdemona opposite Mario Del Monaco&#x27;s Otello. For some 20 years she made the Met the focus of her activities. For the 1962-1963 season, she convinced Met director Rudolf Bing to stage a revival of Cilea&#x27;s &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, an opera Bing said he &quot;detested&quot;. Tebaldi was not in top form and cancelled performances; and, as Bing was quoted in &quot;1000 Nights at the Opera&quot;, &quot;We had to do the wretched thing without her.&quot; However, her &quot;Lecouvreur&quot; was a practical move for the Met, as she was &quot;the greatest box-office draw since Flagstad&quot;, according to Francis Robinson, then assistant manager of ticket sales. Tebaldi however returned triumphantly to the role of Adriana for the opening night of the 1968-69 season. The MET scored a box office record of $126,000.

One of the public&#x27;s favourite Tebaldi roles was Minnie in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; of which she sang only five performances in February and March 1970. When she made her debut in the role at the Met, she was told that, as all Minnies do, she would have to enter in the 3rd act on horseback. Tebaldi, who had a lifelong fear of horses, refused to go near the animal until she was sure he was safe. At her first rehearsal, she approached him, patted his mane, and said, &quot;Well, Mr. Horse, I am Tebaldi. You and I are going to be friends, eh?&quot; She conquered her fear and the performances were successful.

She sang more at the Met and far less elsewhere. She developed a special rapport with the Met audiences and became known as &quot;Miss Sold Out&quot;, as her name on the marquee was considered a performance that could hardly be matched. She sang there some 270 times in &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot;, &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, and as Violetta in a production of &quot;La Traviata&quot; created specially for her. Puccini&#x27;s Tosca was her most regular role there, with 45 performances. She was the Leonora in &quot;La forza del destino&quot; on the night in 1960 when Leonard Warren suddenly died mid-performance; and she was Adriana Lecouvreur on the night Placido Domingo made his Met debut in 1968. She made her last appearance there on 8 January 1973 as Desdemona in &quot;Otello&quot;; it was the role in which she made her Met debut 18 years earlier, and which had become one of her signature roles.

Tebaldi was widely admired by the American operatic public. She did not become a classically temperamental diva, but trusted her artistic instincts. Rudolf Bing, referring to her more assertive side, famously said of her, &quot;She has dimples of iron&quot;.

===Tebaldi and Callas===

During the early 1950s, controversy arose regarding a supposed rivalry between Tebaldi and the Greek-American soprano Maria Callas.

The contrast between Callas&#x27;s often unconventional vocal qualities and Tebaldi&#x27;s classically beautiful sound resurrected an argument as old as opera itself, namely, the beauty of sound versus the expressive use of sound.

In 1951, Tebaldi and Callas were jointly booked for a vocal recital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Although the singers supposedly agreed that neither would perform encores, Tebaldi took two, and Callas was reportedly incensed.

This incident began the rivalry, which reached a fever pitch in the mid-1950s, at times even engulfing the two women themselves, who were said by their more fanatical followers to have engaged in verbal barbs in each other&#x27;s direction. Tebaldi was quoted as saying, &quot;I have one thing that Callas doesn&#x27;t have: a heart&quot; while Callas was quoted in &quot;Time&quot; magazine as saying that comparing her with Tebaldi was like &quot;comparing Champagne with Cognac. No, with Coca Cola&quot;. However, witnesses to the interview stated that Callas only said &quot;champagne with cognac&quot;, and it was a bystander who quipped, &quot;No, with Coca-Cola&quot;, but the &quot;Time&quot; reporter attributed the latter comment to Callas.

According to John Ardoin, however, these two singers should never have been compared. Tebaldi was trained by Carmen Melis, a verismo specialist, and she was rooted in the early 20th-century Italian school of singing just as firmly as Callas was rooted in 19th-century bel canto.

Callas was a dramatic soprano, whereas Tebaldi considered herself essentially a lyric soprano. Callas and Tebaldi generally sang a different repertoire: in the early years of her career, Callas concentrated on the heavy dramatic soprano roles and later in her career on the bel canto repertoire, whereas Tebaldi concentrated on late Verdi and verismo roles. They shared a few roles, including Tosca in Puccini&#x27;s opera and &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, which Tebaldi performed only late in her career.

The alleged rivalry aside, Callas made remarks appreciative of Tebaldi, and vice versa. During an interview with Norman Ross in Chicago, Callas said, &quot;I admire Tebaldi&#x27;s tone; it&#x27;s beautiful – also some beautiful phrasing. Sometimes, I actually wish I had her voice.&quot; Francis Robinson of the Met wrote of an incident in which Tebaldi asked him to recommend a recording of &quot;La Gioconda&quot; to help her learn the role. Being fully aware of the alleged rivalry, he recommended Zinka Milanov&#x27;s version. A few days later, he went to visit Tebaldi, only to find her sitting by the speakers, listening intently to Callas&#x27;s recording. She then looked up at him and asked, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you tell me Maria&#x27;s was the best?&quot; According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, when Callas quit La Scala, &quot;Tebaldi made a surprising maneuver: she announced that she would not sing at La Scala without Callas. &#x27;I sing only for artistic reasons; it is not my custom to sing against anybody&#x27;, she said.&quot;

Callas visited Tebaldi after a performance of &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; at the Met in 1968, and the two were reunited. In 1978, Tebaldi spoke warmly of her late colleague and summarized this rivalry:
This rivality &quot;[sic]&quot; was really building from the people of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don&#x27;t know why they put this kind of rivality &quot;[sic]&quot;, because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.

==Voice==

Tebaldi&#x27;s voice was reputed to be one of the most beautiful of the day, with rich, perfectly produced tones. At the start of her career, her audition in bomb-ravaged La Scala&#x27;s reopening was marked by Arturo Toscanini praising Tebaldi, calling her &quot;la voce d&#x27;angelo&quot; with enthusiastic &quot;Brava!&quot;s and applauds.

British musicologist Alan Blyth posited that in posterity, Tebaldi holds a position of being one of the last and best spinto sopranos of the last 50 years, due to Tebaldi&#x27;s successors in the fach not having the right vocal equipment for her parts. Blyth attributed this in part to Tebaldi&#x27;s recordings and her live performances onstage. Tebaldi&#x27;s voice added a frisson of urgency when she sang in an opera house. This was noted in two of her performances as Leonora in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, evident in a recording done at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in 1953, where conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos urged her to great heights of vocal and dramatic achievement, and a live video recording in Naples.

Montserrat Caballe remarked on an interview that Tebaldi, &quot;She was our Aida, our Traviata, our Manon Lescaut. She was all the roles, and she was the most perfect human voice we ever heard&quot;, likewise, Robert Merrill and Licia Albanese commented on the sumptuous and beautiful quality of Tebaldi&#x27;s voice.

Tebaldi withdrew from performances in 1963 to restudy, made in part due to the emotional stress after eighteen years of singing. After thirteen months of reworking her voice, Tebaldi possessed an unmistakable metallic edge in her voice which only strengthened over the years. In her mid-to-later career, Tebaldi shifted from being a spinto to one with a near-dramatic sound. Adding &quot;La Gioconda&quot; in her repertoire, Tebaldi had chest notes carried high, bearing ample size and strength but little of the known beauty of Tebaldi&#x27;s tone. Similarly, in her recorded Puccini roles at that time, one can&#x27;t always count on the &quot;floats&quot; being easily produced or accurately pitched.

Some critics of Tebaldi have commented adversely on her seemingly incomplete technique; sometimes she took on strident, full-voiced top notes when tackling material above the high B-flat, and had occasional lapses in her pitch. For most audiences however, there was the sheer and deep richness of Tebaldi&#x27;s voice, her melting legato phrases, the deeply expressive but never maudlin quality of singing, the beauty of her floated pianissimo high notes, and her temperament when dwelling in moments of dramatic intensity. Tebaldi&#x27;s often mentioned alleged rival, Maria Callas, said in an interview, &quot;I admire Tebaldi&#x27;s tone; it&#x27;s beautiful – also some beautiful phrasing. Sometimes, I actually wish I had her voice.&quot;

Tebaldi herself mentioned that recording presented challenges for her, as she missed the stimulation of an audience, and her powerful voice would often cause sound engineers to insist that she turn away from the microphone at moments of climactic intensity.

==Personal life==

Tebaldi enjoyed a beloved relationship with her mother, who helped nurture her and was devoted to her career and well-being from an early age. Her mother&#x27;s death in 1957 was a huge blow to Tebaldi, whose grief was unbearable and it took effort to go back to the stage.

Tebaldi never married. In a 1995 interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, she said she had no regrets about her single life. &quot;I was in love many times,&quot; she said. &quot;This is very good for a woman.&quot; But she added, &quot;How could I have been a wife, a mother and a singer? Who takes care of the piccolini when you go around the world? Your children would not call you Mama, but Renata.&quot; She also wrote, &quot;I started my career at 22 and finished it at 54. Thirty-two years of success, satisfaction and sacrifices. Singing was my life&#x27;s scope to the point that I could never have a family.&quot; Tebaldi had a short relationship with bass Nicola Rossi-Lemeni. A longer one with conductor Arturo Basile was formed in 1958, Basile reportedly saying their plans to marry were ended by Tebaldi in 1962 due to Basile&#x27;s behaviour.

==Later years==

By the end of her career, Tebaldi had sung in 1,262 performances: 1,048 complete operas and 214 concerts.

Tebaldi retired from the opera stage in 1973 as Desdemona in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, the same role she debuted there nearly 20 years previously. She gave recitals around the globe. In one recital held in Manila with frequent partner Franco Corelli, Tebaldi&#x27;s voice cracked in a Manon Lescaut aria; she then massaged her throat and genuflected to great applause from the audience. In January 1976, she gave her last recital in New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. She received six curtain calls and standing ovations from the audience. She then moved out of her New York apartment, her home for many years during her stint at the Met, and returned to Italy, where she gave her final public appearance in a vocal recital in La Scala in May 1976. Regarding her decision to retire, Tebaldi said that she stopped singing while she still had a powerful voice to avoid &quot;the mortifying season of decline&quot;.

She spent the majority of her last days in Milan. She died on 19 December 2004 at age 82 at her home in San Marino. She is buried in the Tebaldi family chapel at Mattaleto cemetery in Langhirano. At her death, audiences at Venice&#x27;s La Fenice observed a moment of silence in her memory. Luciano Pavarotti said, &quot;Farewell, Renata, your memory and your voice will be etched on my heart forever&quot;.

==Honours==

Tebaldi won the first Grammy Award Best Classical Performance - Vocal Soloist in 1959 for her album Operatic Recital. Their joint recording of Puccini&#x27;s Turandot, conducted by Erich Leinsdorf and starring Birgit Nilsson as Turandot, Jussi Björling as Calaf, Tebaldi as Liù and Giorgio Tozzi as Timur with the Rome Opera Orchestra won the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording in 1961.

She became a member of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic as a Grand Officer in 1968 and a Knight Grand Cross in 1992. She was also made a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from France.

==Legacy==

From February 2010 until 2013, the 15th-century Castle of Torrechiara – Langhirano – hosted within its rooms an exhibition dedicated to Renata Tebaldi. This “Castle for a Queen” unveils the many sides of this great diva, whose artistic and personal life remains on display. The items showcased followed her over the arc of time as she spread the world-class tradition of Italian lyrical art, all the way from the beginning of her career and throughout her artistic achievements. The exhibition is presented by the Renata Tebaldi Committee in collaboration with the Superintendence of Environmental Heritage and Landscape of the province of Parma and Piacenza, the Regio Theatre Foundation of Parma and the Municipality of Langhirano and with the patronage of the province of Parma. On 7 June 2014, the museum dedicated to Renata Tebaldi was inaugurated in the stables of Villa Pallavicino in Busseto. Tebaldi was awarded a star for recording in 1960 on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 6628 Hollywood Boulevard, Hollywood, California.
