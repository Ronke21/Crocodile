<text>Oligodendrocytes (), also known as oligodendroglia, are a type of neuroglia whose main function is to provide the myelin sheath to neuronal axons in the central nervous system (CNS). Myelination gives metabolic support to, and insulates the axons of most vertebrates. A single oligodendrocyte can extend its processes to cover up to 40 axons, that can include multiple adjacent axons. The myelin sheath is not continuous but is segmented along the axon&#x27;s length at gaps known as the nodes of Ranvier. In the peripheral nervous system the myelination of axons is carried out by Schwann cells.

Oligodendrocytes are found exclusively in the CNS, which comprises the brain and spinal cord. They are the most widespread cell lineage, including oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, pre-myelinating cells, and mature myelinating oligodendrocytes in the CNS white matter. Non-myelinating oligodendrocytes are found in the grey matter surrounding and lying next to neuronal cell bodies. They are known as neuronal satellite cells, and their presence is not understood.

It was once thought that oligodendrocytes were produced in the ventral neural tube, the embryonic precursor to the CNS. Studies have suggested that they originate from the ventral ventricular zone of the embryonic spinal cord, with some potential concentrations in the forebrain. Oligodendrocytes are the last type of cell to be generated in the CNS. Oligodendrocytes were discovered by Pío del Río Hortega.

==Classification==
Oligodendrocytes are a type of glial cell, non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system. They arise during development from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which can be identified by their expression of a number of antigens, including the ganglioside GD3, the NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, and the platelet-derived growth factor-alpha receptor subunit (PDGF-alphaR). Mature oligodendrocytes are broadly classified into either myelinating or non-myelinating neuronal satellite cells. Precursors and both mature types are typically identified by their expression of the transcription factor OLIG2.

==Development==
Most oligodendrocytes develop during embryogenesis and early postnatal life from restricted periventricular germinal regions. Oligodendrocyte formation in the adult brain is associated with glial-restricted progenitor cells, known as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Subventricular zone OPCs are activated and then migrate away from germinal zones to populate both developing white and gray matter, where they differentiate and mature into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. However, it is not clear whether all oligodendrocyte progenitors undergo this sequence of events.

Between midgestation and term birth in human cerebral white matter, three successive stages of the classic human oligodendrocyte lineage are found: OPCs, immature oligodendrocytes (non-myelinating), and mature oligodendrocytes (myelinating). It has been suggested that some undergo apoptosis and others fail to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes but persist as adult OPCs. Remarkably, oligodendrocyte population originated in the subventricular zone can be dramatically expanded by administering epidermal growth factor (EGF).

== Function ==
===Myelination===

Mammalian nervous systems depend crucially on myelin sheaths, which reduce ion leakage and decrease the capacitance of the cell membrane, for rapid signal conduction. Myelin also increases impulse speed, as saltatory conduction of action potentials occurs at the nodes of Ranvier in oligodendrocytes. The impulse speed of a myelinated axon increases linearly with the axon diameter, whereas the impulse speed of unmyelinated cells increases only with the square root of the diameter. The insulation must be proportional to the diameter of the fibre inside. The optimal ratio of axon diameter divided by the total fiber diameter (which includes the myelin) is 0.6.
Myelination is only prevalent in a few brain regions at birth and continues into adulthood. The entire process is not complete until about 25–30 years of age. Myelination is an important component of intelligence, and white matter quantity may be positively correlated with IQ test results in children. Rats that were raised in an enriched environment, which is known to increase cognitive flexibility, had more myelination in their corpus callosum.

=== Immune function ===
Oligodendrocytes, best known for their role in myelinating axons in the central nervous system, also have important functions in immune regulation. These cells can influence the immune environment by secreting cytokines and chemokines, which modulate the activity of various immune cells. Oligodendrocytes express receptors that allow them to respond to inflammatory signals, thereby participating in the brain&#x27;s defense mechanisms. Additionally, they play a role in maintaining the blood-brain barrier and can contribute to the resolution of inflammation, highlighting their multifaceted role in both neural maintenance and immune responses. While most research has focused on the immune functions of OPCs, it is believed that oligodendrocytes themselves still possess significant immune functions.

===Metabolic support===
Oligodendrocytes interact closely with nerve cells and provide trophic support by the production of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). They may also directly provide metabolites to neurons, as described by the lactate shuttle hypothesis.

It is hypothesized that satellite oligodendrocytes (or perineuronal oligodendrocytes) are functionally distinct from other oligodendrocytes. They are not attached to neurons via myelin sheaths and, therefore, do not contribute to insulation. They remain opposed to neurons and regulate the extracellular fluid. Satellite oligodendrocytes are considered to be a part of the grey matter whereas myelinating oligodendrocytes are a part of the white matter. They may support neuronal metabolism. Satellite oligodendrocytes may be recruited to produce new myelin after a demyelinating injury.

==Clinical significance==

Diseases that result in injury to oligodendrocytes include demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and various leukodystrophies. Trauma to the body, e.g. spinal cord injury, can also cause demyelination. The immature oligodendrocytes, which increase in number during mid-gestation, are more vulnerable to hypoxic injury and are involved in periventricular leukomalacia. This largely congenital condition of damage to the newly forming brain can therefore lead to cerebral palsy. In cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke and possibly multiple sclerosis, oligodendrocytes are thought to be damaged by excessive release of the neurotransmitter, glutamate. Damage has also been shown to be mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Oligodendrocyte dysfunction may also be implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Oligodendrocytes are also susceptible to infection by the JC virus, which causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a condition that specifically affects white matter, typically in immunocompromised patients. The chemotherapy agent Fluorouracil (5-FU) causes damage to the oligodendrocytes in mice, leading to both acute central nervous system (CNS) damage and progressively worsening delayed degeneration of the CNS.

DNA methylation may also have a role in the degeneration of oligodendrocytes.

Damage to myelin has been shown to exacerbate amyloid plaque accumulation, potentially placing age-related myelin decline as an upstream risk factor in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Oligodendrocytes also abundantly express components of the amyloidogenic pathway, produce amyloid beta (Aβ), and contribute to plaque burden, which is relevant when considering therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

The neuronal satellite cells in the grey matter of the lobes of the brain, can produce slow-growing tumours. The tumours known as oligodendrogliomas are of clusters of tumour cells beneath the pia mater.

<text>Nauru First () is the only formal political party in Nauru.

== Philosophy and leading members ==
Its positions tend to be liberal, pro-government transparency, and Christian democratic. Its founding members were Kieren Keke (a medical doctor), David Adeang (a legal counsel and former minister of finance), Marlene Moses (former health minister), Roland Kun (director of the island&#x27;s fisheries), Sean Oppenheimer (manager of Capelle&#x27;s, the country&#x27;s largest private enterprise), who has since resigned from the party due to death threats, and Sprent Dabwido (an insurance worker). Its official publication is the irregularly-published &quot;The Visionary&quot;, which contains harsh criticism of government officials.

== Elections ==
In the May 2003 elections three members of Naoero Amo were elected: David Adeang, Kieren Keke, and Riddell Akua. Adeang became finance minister and Keke minister of health, sports, and transportation. Akua became the Chairman of Nauru Phosphate Corporation. The ministers lost their posts when President Ludwig Scotty&#x27;s government was ousted in August 2003 but regained new posts when he returned to power on 22 June 2004.

Adeang was the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Finance. The party continued to support President Scotty, and in the 2007 parliamentary elections, Scotty supporters won most of the seats in Parliament. The party system in Nauru remains somewhat fluid and it is not known how many of these supporters are members of the Nauru First Party, but it is known that most of the members currently supporting Scotty were reelected, including Adeang.

== Controversies ==
In December 2007, a dispute among Nauru First Party members David Adeang, Kieren Keke and others led to a vote of no-confidence in the Parliament of Nauru, unseating the Administration of the President of Nauru, Ludwig Scotty, and the appointment of a government led by newly appointed President Marcus Stephen. This new Administration excluded Adeang in the ministerial team; he was replaced as minister for Foreign Affairs by Keke.

<text>Kieren Aedogan Ankwong Keke (born 27 June 1971) is a Nauruan politician and medical doctor. He is a member of the Parliament of Nauru and former Minister of Finance and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

==Background==

He is currently a leading figure of the Nauru First (Naoero Amo) party, and one of the few medical professionals on the island (others are Dr. Mark Kun, Dr. Ludwig Keke—Kieren&#x27;s father, a dentist— Dr. Godfrey Waidabu, who now lives in the Marshall Islands, and Dr. Kiki Thoma). He was Minister of Finance in the cabinet of Ludwig Scotty in 2003.

In 2004, he was not allowed to take his parliamentary seat. The speaker of Parliament, Russell Kun claimed that Keke, having Australian nationality as well as Nauruan, could not sit in Parliament. Keke was also arrested along with Baron Waqa, David Adeang and Fabian Ribauw in April 2004 and charged with sedition after a protest at Nauru&#x27;s airport, but the charges were soon dropped. The charges were dropped following a resolution of Parliament moved by Keke and others charged that the charges be dropped. The DPP was not consulted by the Parliament and the motion was in contravention of the Constitution and the Rule of Law. Keke was reelected to Parliament in October 2004 and retained his post as health minister.

Keke resigned from the government, along with Frederick Pitcher and Roland Kun, in late 2007 over allegations of misconduct on the part of Adeang and Scotty&#x27;s unwillingness to act against Adeang. He led the opposition to Scotty in a no-confidence motion on 13 November 2007; although a majority of those voting supported the motion (eight in favour, seven opposed), it fell short of the necessary nine votes.

==Stephen Administration==

===2007===

After Scotty was ousted in another vote on 19 December and Marcus Stephen (a cousin of Kieren Keke) was elected president, Keke was named Minister of Foreign Affairs, Telecommunications, and Transport and Minister Assisting the President of Nauru

Keke had previously been regarded as a reformist, both through his participation in the Administration of Ludwig Scotty, and because of the reformist discourse of the Nauru First Party, of which Keke is a prominent member. The outgoing Scotty Administration, which had won a landslide election victory only weeks before Keke and others resigned and participated in successive votes of no confidence, enjoyed wide popular support, and was broadly seen in the years 2004-2007 as offering a stable contrast to a previous period of very frequent use of the vote of no confidence, when governments would fall over issues which sometimes reflected relations between personalities rather than the exigencies of the wider national interest. Others would argue that allegations against former minister David Adeang, around which the November and December 2007 no-confidence votes against President Ludwig Scotty were centred, constituted an issue important enough to justify the use of such a Parliamentary device, with its far-reaching consequences.

===2008===

In 2008, Keke&#x27;s Foreign Affairs department was preparing for the June 2008 meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Santiago, Chile, owing to Nauru&#x27;s interest in whaling issues as a Pacific maritime nation and in the related issue of tuna fishing stocks, given the country&#x27;s tuna fishing activities. The change of stance on whaling adopted by the government of Australia was likely to cause resonances for Keke&#x27;s Department.

In February 2008 Keke announced that the Nauruan Government was studying the possibility of developing service and maintenance facilities for fishing vessels from countries in the region.

In March 2008, the Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru, David Adeang, attempted to have Keke expelled from Parliament, by summoning a Parliamentary session, allegedly without informing members of the government, which resulted in the passing of a law forbidding Members of Parliament to hold dual citizenship. President Stephen argued that the law was unconstitutional; Adeang said it was not. On 28 March, Adeang ordered Keke and another minister, Frederick Pitcher, to vacate their seats in Parliament, since they both hold dual Nauruan and Australian citizenship. The two ministers refused to do so, and Adeang suspended the sitting.

In April 2008 Keke was reelected to the Parliament of Nauru and was retained as a leading member of the Administration of President Marcus Stephen. He was again reelected in 2010.

Keke was replaced as Foreign Minister by Matthew Batsiua on 10 November 2011.

== Dabwido Administration ==
Sprent Dabwido was elected president in November 2011 after the resignation of President Marcus Stephen and removal of President Freddie Pitcher. Keke was initially opposed to this administration, but in May 2012 Dabwido dismissed his entire cabinet and replaced them with opposition members. Keke was reinstated as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Keke was the representative of the Alliance of Small Island States at the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and expressed his disappointment at the outcome, describing it as &quot;words&quot; without &quot;action&quot;.

On 7 February 2013, Keke resigned from all his government portfolios (Foreign Affairs, Trade, Health and Sport), without offering a public explanation.

Keke was re-elected to Parliament in the elections held in 2013.

<doc id="383777" wikidata="Q7816170" url="?curid=383777" title="Tom Henke">
<text>Thomas Anthony Henke (born December 21, 1957), nicknamed &quot;the Terminator&quot;, is an American former Major League Baseball relief pitcher. He was one of the most dominant and feared closers during the late 1980s and early 1990s, pitching for the Texas Rangers (1982–1984, 1993–1994), Toronto Blue Jays (1985–1992), and St. Louis Cardinals (1995).

On the mound, Henke was easily recognizable by the large-rimmed glasses he wore at a time when many players began using contact lenses. At a height of 6&#x27; 5&quot;, he cast an imposing figure and dominated batters with his hard fastball early in the count, and his forkball for the strikeout. Henke struck out 9.8 batters per 9 innings pitched over his career.

==Early life==
Tom Henke was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and started out throwing every night to his father, who caught his pitches while sitting on a five-gallon bucket. &quot;Every kid should have a dad like that&quot;, Henke said. He grew up in Taos, Missouri and attended Blair Oaks High School. After high school, Henke played at East Central Junior College. In 1980, a couple of friends, who believed Henke had pro-caliber stuff, told him they would buy the beer if he showed up at a talent evaluation opportunity; he did and was noticed.

==Career==
Henke was drafted on June 5, 1979, by the Seattle Mariners in the 20th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. On January 11, 1980, he was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the first round (24th pick) of the 1980 Major League Baseball draft (January Secondary) but again did not sign. Henke signed with the Texas Rangers after being selected in the fourth round of the 1980 amateur draft (June Secondary).

===Texas Rangers (1982–1984)===
After signing with the Rangers, Henke was assigned to the Gulf Coast League Rangers in the Gulf Coast League where he had immediate success, going 3-3 with a 0.95 ERA in 38 innings, earning a promotion to the Single-A Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League. In 1981, Henke started the season back at Asheville, where his 8-6 record with 3 saves and 2.93 ERA in 92 innings earned him a promotion to the AA Tulsa Drillers in the Texas League. Henke spent the entire 1982 minor league season back at Tulsa, despite putting up similarly impressive numbers (14 saves with a 2.67 ERA and 100 strikeouts in innings). He did, however, see time with the Rangers at the end of the season and made his major league debut on September 10. In 1983, Henke was finally promoted to the Oklahoma City 89ers in the American Association, but again his development stalled and he spent much of the next three seasons at AAA. Despite strong numbers in the minors and similar numbers during his intermittent times in Texas, Henke was labeled as a pitcher who had trouble finding the strike zone (finishing with 20 walks in innings with the Rangers in 1984) and appeared to be the odd man out in the Rangers&#x27; bullpen.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1985–1992)===
However, Henke was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays from the Rangers on January 24, 1985, as a free agent compensation pick. After blazing through the hitters at AAA Syracuse to the tune of a 0.88 ERA and 18 saves in innings over 38 appearances, he won the International League Most Valuable Pitcher Award in 1985. Henke was promoted to Toronto during the 1985 pennant drive and never looked back, not allowing a run in his first 11 appearances and finishing the season with 13 saves. Henke was then made the team&#x27;s closer in 1986, and played a major role in the Toronto Blue Jays&#x27; successful run from the mid-1980s to early 1990s, finishing with 217 saves with the team and helping Toronto to its first championship, a six-game defeat of the Atlanta Braves in the 1992 World Series.

=== Texas Rangers II (1993–1994) ===
In 1993, as a free agent, Henke signed with the Texas Rangers for two years. Henke had a career-high 40 saves in 1993. In 1994, he had only 15 saves due to spending time on the disabled list.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1995)===
Henke, age 37, signed with the Cardinals for the 1995 season after two years with the Texas Rangers. The closer converted his first 22 saves for the team in 1995 ending with 36 total saves for the year. Henke was honored with the St. Louis Chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association (BBWAA) J.G. Taylor Spink Award as the St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award. Despite having just finished one of the best seasons of his career and 22nd in MVP voting,
 Henke decided to retire at the end of the 1995 season. &quot;I&#x27;ve always admired guys who have gone out at the top of their game,&quot; Henke said. &quot;Sometimes you have to look at what&#x27;s the most important thing in life. I&#x27;d like to see my kids grow up.&quot;

==Career milestones==
Over his 14-year career, Henke was named to the All-Star team twice: 1987, when he led the American League with 34 saves and 62 games finished, and 1995, his last season, and only season in the National League. He also won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award in 1995.

Henke was the seventh reliever to eclipse the 300 saves plateau and when he retired his 311 career saves ranked 5th on the all-time career list.

Other career accomplishments are:
*14 MLB season, 789.2 IP
*2.67 ERA
*1.092 WHIP
*255 walks to 861 Ks for a 3.38 SO/BB ratio
*.982 fielding percentage
*Playoff stats: 19.2 IP / 2-0 / 1.83 ERA / 0.966 WHIP / 5 saves (all saves in 1992 playoffs for World Champion Blue Jays.)

==Personal==
Henke lives on his farm in Taos, Missouri, with his family: wife Kathy and children Linsay, Ryan, Kim, and Amanda (who has Down syndrome).

Henke met his wife Kathy in college. &quot;My catcher one day said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s go to McDonald&#x27;s&#x27; and Kathy was working there at the time&quot;, Henke said. &quot;She sold me a Big Mac and I was done. She was tall and athletic and I was pretty shy. Turns out we had a class together and started talking&quot;.

Coming from a small town with a population under 900, Henke admitted he initially had to overcome a fear of big cities. &quot;I hated going to New York City&quot;, he said. &quot;I felt like a fish out of water there. I&#x27;d go from the hotel to Yankee Stadium and that&#x27;s it. It took me two or three years before I went out to visit the Statue of Liberty and I never took the subway.&quot; On living in Toronto, Henke said &quot;I rented an apartment downtown for two or three years and that wasn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m just a guy from a small town and that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m most comfortable&quot;.

=== Charity involvement ===
Since 1995, Henke has teamed with the Jefferson City, Missouri Cosmo Club to hold the annual Tom Henke Charity Classic Golf Tournament which raises money for the Special Learning Center, a school for handicapped children. He also volunteers with Down syndrome charities, the Special Olympics and the Cancer Society, and is on the board of directors with the Missouri Department of Mental Health.

=== In popular culture ===
Henke&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the Terminator&quot;, was given to him by teammate John Cerutti in 1985 after they saw the movie &quot;The Terminator&quot; together.

&quot;The Ballad of Tom Henke&quot; was written as a tribute to Henke&#x27;s life story and &quot;termination&quot; of opposing batters. The 45 was released in 1985. Side 2 has &quot;The Tom Henke Rag&quot;, an instrumental.

Henke appeared in a TV commercial for Aqua Velva.

== Honors ==

In 2000, Henke was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame.

On August 9, 2009, the Toronto Blue Jays honored Henke with a figurine giveaway bearing his likeness.

On August 28, 2009, Henke threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Busch Stadium during the Washington Nationals vs St. Louis Cardinals baseball game.

On January 24, 2011, Henke was named to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Hall during a ceremony at St Marys, Ontario, on June 18, 2011.

On August 14, 2016, a final ceremony of three with Blue Jays&#x27; all-time greats was held to celebrate the club&#x27;s 40th Anniversary. Henke represented the bullpen along with Duane Ward and Mike Timlin. Former Blue Jays starters Roy Halladay, Dave Stieb, Pat Hentgen and Juan Guzman were welcomed back too. The entire group exemplified top arms in club history.

In November 2018, Henke was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Freecode, formerly Freshmeat, was a website owned by BIZX, Inc., hosting mainly open-source software for programmers and developers. Among other things, the site also hosted user reviews and discussions. While a majority of the software covered is open source for Unix-like systems, Freecode also covered releases of closed-source, commercial and cross-platform software on and handhelds. Freecode was notable for its age, having started in 1997 as the first web-based aggregator of software releases.

The site was renamed from &quot;Freshmeat&quot; to &quot;Freecode&quot; on October 29, 2011, and in September 2012, Dice Holdings acquired the website from Geeknet.

Purportedly as a result of low traffic levels, the site is no longer being updated as of June 18, 2014. Because many of the linked software projects are otherwise difficult to find, the site contents have been kept online. After Open Source Initiative co-founder Eric S. Raymond called for a replacement, freshcode.club was created and is accepting submissions.

On January 27, 2016, Freecode was sold, along with SourceForge and Slashdot, to current owners BIZX, Inc. The site remained in its archived state.

, Freecode redirects to the SourceForge homepage, while freshcode.club is still maintained.

<doc id="383785" wikidata="Q2905708" url="?curid=383785" title="Newfie">
<text>Newfie (also Newf or sometimes Newfy) is a colloquial term used by Canadians and others for someone who is from Newfoundland. Many Newfoundlanders consider &quot;Newfie&quot; a slur first used by American and Canadian military forces stationed on the island. The term is also associated with jokes from the mid-to-late 20th century that depicted &quot;Newfies&quot; as foolish, in particular when told in Canadian French, leading to a belief in the derogatory nature of the term.

==Usage==
During the Second World War, sailors on convoy duty nicknamed St. John&#x27;s &quot;Newfiejohn&quot;.

The first edition of the &quot;Gage Canadian Dictionary,&quot; published in 1983, and the second edition of the &quot;Random House Unabridged Dictionary,&quot; published in 1987, both include usage notes describing the term &#x27;Newfie&#x27; as offensive. However, neither the second edition of the &quot;Canadian Oxford Dictionary&quot;, published in 2004, nor the current edition of the &quot;Dictionary of Newfoundland English&quot;, published in 1998, make such a mention.
In March 2006, an Edmonton police officer was disciplined for using the word &quot;Newphie&quot; to describe the apprehension of an individual under the Mental Health Act.

<doc id="383789" wikidata="Q1771319" url="?curid=383789" title="Ferncliff Cemetery">
<text>Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum is a cemetery in Hartsdale, New York, United States, about north of Midtown Manhattan. It was founded in 1902, and is non-sectarian. Ferncliff has columbariums, a crematory, a small chapel, and a main office located in the rear of the main building.

==Mausoleums==
Ferncliff Cemetery has three community mausoleums that offer what &quot;The New York Times&quot; has described as &quot;lavish burial spaces&quot;. This cemetery includes columbariums. As of 2001, a standard crypt space in the mausoleums was priced at $15,000. The highest-priced spaces were private burial rooms with bronze gates, crystal chandeliers, and stained-glass windows, priced at $280,000.

===Ferncliff===
The Ferncliff Mausoleum, aka &quot;The Cathedral of Memories&quot;, is the cemetery&#x27;s oldest mausoleum, constructed in 1928. It has classic architecture, but the corridors are dark without glass panes to admit natural light. Ed Sullivan and Joan Crawford are two of the most famous interments in the main mausoleum. Judy Garland was interred here from her death in 1969 until 2017 when her family moved her remains to Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

===Shrine of Memories===
The Shrine of Memories is Ferncliff&#x27;s second mausoleum and was constructed in 1956. &quot;Shrine of Memories&quot; is a more contemporary structure than &quot;Ferncliff Mausoleum&quot;. It has many panes of glass to admit natural light, and there is a painting of Christopher Columbus in the main hall of the building. Basil Rathbone is one of the most famous interments in &quot;Shrine of Memories&quot;.

===Rosewood===
Rosewood is Ferncliff&#x27;s most recently completed community mausoleum, having been constructed in 1999. Joseph J. Mangan was the architect of Rosewood. Singer Aaliyah and her father Michael Haughton have a private room in Rosewood. Cab Calloway is interred with his wife Zulme &quot;Nuffie&quot;.

==Ground burials==
The cemetery is also known for its in-ground burials in sections located in front of the mausoleums. Ferncliff is one of the very few cemeteries that does not permit upright headstones in its outdoor plots. All outdoor grave markers are flush with the ground. This feature facilitates maintenance of the cemetery grounds. However, there are several upright headstones that were placed before this policy was instituted. Malcolm X and the most famous ground burials, in plot Pinewood B.

<text>Lake Peipus is the largest trans-boundary lake in Europe, lying on the international border between Estonia and Russia.

The lake is the fifth-largest in Europe after Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega (in Russia), Lake Vänern (in Sweden), and Lake Saimaa (in Finland).

It covers , and it has an average depth of , the deepest point being . The lake has several islands and consists of three parts:
*Lake Peipus / Chudskoye (, ), the northern part of the lake, with an area of (73%)
*Lake Pihkva / Pskovskoye (, ), the southern part of the lake (area or 20%)
*Lake Lämmi / Tyoploye (, ), the sound connecting the other two parts of the lake (area or 7%)

The lake is used for fishing and recreation, but suffered from environmental degradation from Soviet-era agriculture. Some 30 rivers and streams discharge into Lake Peipus, the two largest of which are the Velikaya and Emajõgi. The lake drains into the Gulf of Finland via the Narva River.

On 5 April 1242, the frozen lake was the site of the Battle on the Ice (also known as the Battle of Lake Peipus) between the armies of the Novgorod Republic and the Teutonic Order.

==Name==
The origin of the name &quot;Peipus&quot; () is uncertain, although it may be paralleled by Lake Peipiä () and the village of Peipiä () along its shore, and by Peipozero () near Onega Bay. Paul Ariste suggested a pre-Finnic origin of the name, Julius Mägiste suggested a connection with &quot;peipo&quot; or &quot;peippu&quot; &#x27;chaffinch&#x27; (or other songbird) or Votic &quot;põippõ&quot; &#x27;chicken&#x27;, suggested derivation from a personal name, and suggested a Baltic etymology, comparing it to Latvian &quot;piepe&quot; and Lithuanian &quot;pepis&quot; &#x27;moisture, mold&#x27;. The Russian name &quot;Chudskoye ozero&quot; (Чудское озеро) means &#x27;Chud Lake&#x27; (i.e., &#x27;Estonian Lake&#x27;); the ethnonym &quot;Chud&quot; () referred to various Finnic peoples in what is now Estonia, Karelia, and northwestern Russia.

==Formation==

The lake is a remnant of a larger body of water that existed in this area during a former ice age. In the Paleozoic Era, 300 to 400 million years ago, the entire territory of the modern Gulf of Finland was covered by a sea. Its modern relief was formed as a result of glacier activities, the last of which, the Weichselian glaciation, ended about 12,000 years ago.

==Topography and hydrography==
The banks of Lake Peipus have smooth contours and form only one large bay: Raskopelsky Bay. On the northern and northwestern shores of the lake there are sand dunes covered with pine forest and sandy beaches. Along the sandy shores, there is a wide stretch of shallow waters. The low shores of the lake mostly consist of peat and are bordered by vast lowland and marshes, which are flooded in the spring, with the flooding area reaching up to . 


The relief of the bottom is uniform and flat, gradually rising near the shores and covered with silt, and in some places with sand. The deepest point of is located in the Teploe Lake, from the coast.

The lake is well-flowing, with the annual inflow of water equal to about half of the total water volume.

The lake water is fresh, with a low transparency of about due to plankton and suspended sediments caused by the river flow. Water currents are weak ; generally induced by wind, so stop when it ceases. However, during the spring flood, there is a constant surface current from north to south.

Because of the shallow depth, the lake quickly warms and cools. Water temperature reaches in July. The lakes freeze in late November – early December and thaw in late April – early May, first lakes Teploe and Pihkva and then lake Peipus. However, due to recent climatic changes, Lake Peipus has now commonly started to freeze later into December and thaw much earlier in April.

==Basin and islands==
About 30 rivers flow into the lake. The largest are Velikaya and Emajõgi; smaller rivers include Zadubka, Cherma, Gdovka, Kuna, Torokhovka, Remda, Rovya, Zhelcha, Chernaya, Lipenka, Startseva, Borovka, Abija, Obdeh, Piusa, Võhandu, Kodza, Kargaya, Omedu, Tagajõgi and Alajõgi. The lake is drained by only one river, the Narva, into the Baltic Sea.

The lake contains 29 islands, with a total area of 25.8 km2, with 40 more islands located within the delta of the Velikaya River. The islands are low wetlands, elevated above the lake surface on average by only (maximum ) and therefore suffer from floods. The largest islands are Kolpina (area 11 km2) in the south, Piirissaar (area in the center, and Kamenka (area 6 km2). In the center of Pihkva Lake there is a group of Talabski Islands (Talabsk, Talabenets and Verkhniy).

==Flora and fauna==
The lake hosts 54 species of coastal aquatic flora, including cane, calamus (&quot;Acorus calamus&quot;), bulrush, grass rush, lesser bulrush (&quot;Typha angustifolia&quot;) and water parsnip (&quot;Sium latifolium&quot;). Floating plants are rare and are of only three types: arrowhead, yellow water-lily and water knotweed. The lake is home to perch, pike-perch, bream, roaches, whitefishes, smelt and other species of fish. The wetlands of the coastal strip of the lake are important resting and feeding grounds for swans, geese and ducks migrating between the White Sea and Baltic Sea and western Europe. Lake Peipus is one of the main stopovers for Bewick&#x27;s swan (&quot;Cygnus columbianus&quot;). The swans leave their breeding grounds in the Russian Arctic away and the lake is the first stop for many. Bewick&#x27;s rarely fly more than without fueling so they are near to the limits of their endurance when they reach the lake.

==Ecology==
The ecological condition of the lake basin is, in general, satisfactory – water is mostly of grades I and II (clean), and is of grade III in some rivers due to the high content of phosphorus. The water condition of the rivers has improved since 2001–2007, but there is an increase in population of blue-green algae. The main problem of Lake Peipus is its eutrophication.

==Economy==
The towns standing on the banks are relatively small and include Mustvee (population 1,610), Kallaste (population 1,260) and Gdov (population 4,400). The largest city, Pskov (population 202,000) stands on the river Velikaya, from the lake. Ship navigation is well developed and serves fishery, transport of goods and passengers and tourist tours. The picturesque shores of the lake are a popular destination for tourism and recreation at several tourist camps and sanatoriums.

==History==
In 1242, the southern part of Lake Peipus hosted a major historical battle where Teutonic Knights were defeated by Novgorod troops led by Alexander Nevsky. The battle is remarkable in that it was mostly fought on the frozen surface of the lake and is therefore called the Battle on the Ice.

The largest city on the lake, Pskov, is also one of the oldest cities in Russia, known from at least 903 AD from a record in the Primary Chronicle of the Laurentian Codex. The city had a certain measure of independence even though it was dominated by its neighbours - Novgorod, Lithuania and Muscovy - and eventually incorporated in the Russian state. Several historical buildings remain in the city, including Mirozhsky Monastery (1156, which contains famous frescoes of 14–17th centuries), Pskov Kremlin (14–17th centuries) with the five-domed Trinity Cathedral (1682–1699), churches of Ivanovo (until 1243), Snetogorsky Monastery (13th century), Church of Basil (1413), Church of Cosmas and Damian (1462), Church of St. George (1494) and others.

Gdov was founded in 1431 as a fortress and became a city in 1780; the only remains of the historical Gdov Kremlin are three fortress walls. Kallaste was founded in the 18th century by the Old Believers who had fled from the Novgorod area, and there is still a functional Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church in the town. Near Kallaste, there is one of the largest surfacings of Devonian sandstone with a length of and a maximum height of , as well as several caves and one of the largest colonies of swallows in Estonia.

<text>Leonid Danylovych Kuchma (, ; born 9 August 1938) is a Ukrainian politician who was the second president of Ukraine from 19 July 1994 to 23 January 2005. The only President of Ukraine to serve two terms, his presidency was marked by democratic backsliding and the growth of the Ukrainian oligarchs, as well as several scandals and improvement of Russia–Ukraine relations.

After a successful career in the machine-building industry of the Soviet Union, Kuchma began his political career in 1990, when he was elected to the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament); he was re-elected in 1994. He served as Prime Minister of Ukraine between October 1992 and September 1993. Kuchma took office after winning the 1994 presidential election against his rival, incumbent President Leonid Kravchuk. Kuchma won re-election for an additional five-year term in 1999. Corruption accelerated after Kuchma&#x27;s election in 1994, but in 2000–2001, his power began to weaken in the face of exposures in the media.

Kuchma&#x27;s administration began a campaign of media censorship in 1999, leading to arrests of journalists, the death of Georgiy Gongadze, and the subsequent Cassette Scandal and mass protests. The Ukrainian economy continued to decline until 1999, whereas growth was recorded since 2000, bringing relative prosperity to some segments of urban residents. During his presidency, Ukrainian-Russian ties began to improve. Kuchma declined to seek a third term in office, instead supporting Party of Regions candidate Viktor Yanukovych for the 2004 election. Following public protests over the alleged electoral fraud which escalated into the Orange Revolution, Kuchma took a neutral stance and was a mediator between Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych. Between 2014 and 2020, Kuchma was a special presidential representative of Ukraine at the quasi peace talks regarding the ongoing War in Donbas.

Kuchma&#x27;s legacy has proven controversial, and he has been described as authoritarian by various sources. Widespread corruption and media censorship under Kuchma&#x27;s administration continue to have an impact on Ukraine today, and he has been accused of promoting oligarchism.

==Early life==
Leonid Danylovych Kuchma was born in the village of Chaikyne in rural Chernihiv Oblast on 9 August 1938. His father, Danylo Prokopovych Kuchma (1901–1942) was wounded in World War II and eventually died of his wounds in the field hospital #756 (near the village of Novoselytsia) when Leonid was four. His mother Paraska Trokhymivna Kuchma worked on a kolkhoz.

Kuchma attended the Kostobobriv general education school in the neighboring Semenivka Raion. Later he enrolled in Dnipropetrovsk National University as a candidate of technical sciences and he graduated in 1960 with a degree in mechanical engineering (majoring in aerospace engineering). In 1960 joined the Communist Party of Soviet Union. 

==Career==
After graduation, Kuchma worked in the field of aerospace engineering for the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau in Dnipropetrovsk. At 28 he became a testing director for the Bureau deployed at the Baikonur cosmodrome.

Some political observers suggested that Kuchma&#x27;s early career was significantly boosted by his marriage to Lyudmyla Talalayeva, an adopted daughter of Gennadiy Tumanov, the Yuzhmash chief engineering officer and later the Soviet Minister of Medium Machine Building.

At 38 Kuchma became the Communist party chief at Yuzhny Machine-building Plant and a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. He was a delegate of the 27th and 28th Congresses of the Communist Party of Soviet Union. By the end of the 1980s, Kuchma openly criticized the Communist Party.

In 1982 Kuchma was appointed the first deputy of general design engineer at Yuzhmash, and from 1986 to 1992, he held the position of the company&#x27;s general director. From 1990 to 1992, Kuchma was a member of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine&#x27;s parliament). In 1992 he was appointed as Prime Minister of Ukraine. He resigned a year later, complaining of &quot;slow pace of reform&quot;. He was re-elected into parliament in 1994.

==President (1994–2005)==

Kuchma resigned from the position of Prime Minister of Ukraine in September 1993 to run for the presidency in 1994 on a platform to boost the economy by restoring economic relations with Russia and faster pro-market reforms. Kuchma won a clear victory against the incumbent President Leonid Kravchuk, receiving strong support from the industrial areas in the east and south. His worst results were in the west of the country.

Kuchma was re-elected in 1999 to his second term. This time the areas that gave him strongest support last time voted for his opponents, and the areas which voted against him last time came to his support.

During Kuchma&#x27;s presidency, he closed opposition papers and several journalists and political opponents, such as Viacheslav Chornovil, died in mysterious circumstances. According to historian Serhy Yekelchyk, President Kuchma&#x27;s administration &quot;employed electoral fraud freely&quot; during the 2000 constitutional referendum and 1999 presidential elections.
===Domestic policy===
In October 1994, Kuchma announced comprehensive economic reforms, including reduced subsidies, lifting of price controls, lower taxes, privatization of industry and agriculture, and reforms in currency regulation and banking. The parliament approved the plan&#x27;s main points. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) promised a $360 million loan to initiate reforms. 

He was re-elected in 1999 to his second term. Opponents accused him of involvement in the killing in 2000 of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, but Kuchma has consistently denied such claims. Critics have also blamed Kuchma for restrictions on press freedom. Kuchma is believed to have played a key role in sacking the Cabinet of Viktor Yushchenko by Verkhovna Rada on 26 April 2001.

Kuchma&#x27;s Prime Minister from 2002 until early January 2005 was Viktor Yanukovych, after Kuchma dismissed Anatoliy Kinakh, his previous appointee.

===Foreign policy=== 

In 2002, Kuchma stated that Ukraine wanted to sign an association agreement with the European Union by 2003–2004 and that Ukraine would meet all EU membership requirements by 2007–2011. He also hoped for a free trade treaty with the EU.

In his inaugural address, Kuchma said:

Kuchma signed a &quot;Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership&quot; with Russia, and endorsed a round of talks with the CIS. Additionally, he referred to Russian as &quot;an official language&quot;. He signed a special partnership agreement with NATO and raised the possibility of membership of the alliance. Under Kuchma&#x27;s leadership, the Armed Forces of Ukraine participated in the Iraq War.

After Kuchma&#x27;s popularity at home and abroad sank as he became mired in corruption scandals, he turned to Russia as his new ally. From the late 1990s he adopted a foreign policy which he described as &quot;multi-vector&quot;, reaching out to Russia, Europe, and the United States. Critics assessed this policy as manipulating both the West and Russia to the personal benefit of Kuchma and Ukrainian oligarchs.

On 4 October 2001, Siberia Airlines Flight 1812 was shot down over the Black Sea by the Ukrainian Air Force while en route to Novosibirsk, Russia, from Tel Aviv, Israel. All 78 occupants of the plane, most of whom were Israelis visiting relatives in Russia, were killed. Following the shootdown, Kuchma initially refused to accept the resignation of Oleksandr Kuzmuk, Minister of Defence of Ukraine, and said, &quot;Look what is happening around the world, in Europe. We are not the first, and we will not be the last. There is no need to make a tragedy out of this. Mistakes happen everywhere, and not only on this scale, but on a much larger, planetary scale.&quot; A week later, however, Kuchma announced his willingness to cooperate with Russian investigators, apologised to the governments of Russia and Israel, and accepted Kuzmuk&#x27;s resignation.

===Murder of Georgiy Gongadze and Cassette Scandal===

From 1998 to 2000, Kuchma&#x27;s bodyguard Mykola Melnychenko was allegedly eavesdropping Kuchma&#x27;s office, later publishing the recordings. The release of the tapes – dubbed the Cassette Scandal – supposedly revealed Kuchma&#x27;s numerous crimes. In particular was his approving the sale of radar systems to Saddam Hussein (among other illegal arms sales) and ordering the death of journalist Georgiy Gongadze.

In September 2000, Gongadze disappeared and his headless corpse was found mutilated on 3 November 2000. On 28 November, opposition politician Oleksandr Moroz publicised the tape recordings implicating Kuchma in Gongadze&#x27;s murder. In 2005, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General&#x27;s office instigated criminal proceedings against Kuchma and members of his former administration in connection with the murder of Gongadze. In 2005, the press reported that Kuchma had been unofficially granted immunity from prosecution in return for his graceful departure from office in 2005.

Critics of the tapes point to the difficulty of Melnychenko recording 500 hours of dictaphone tape unaided and undetected, the lack of material evidence of said recording equipment, and other doubts which question the authenticity and motive of the release of the tape. Kuchma acknowledged in 2003 that his voice was one of those on the tapes, but claimed the tapes had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.

However, the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Carlos Pascual, revealed that the tapes are genuine, undistorted, unaltered, and not manipulated because of the conclusion from FBI Electronic Research Facility&#x27;s analysis of the original recording device and the original recording found that there are not unusual sounds which would indicate a tampering of the recording, the recording is continuous with no breaks, and there is no manipulation of the digital files.

The Prosecutor General of Ukraine&#x27;s Office cancelled its resolution to deny opening of criminal cases against Kuchma and other politicians within the Gongadze-case on 9 October 2010. On 22 March 2011, Ukraine opened an official investigation into the murder of Gongadze and, two days later, Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kuchma with involvement in the murder. A Ukrainian district court ordered prosecutors to drop criminal charges against Kuchma on 14 December 2011 on grounds that evidence linking him to the murder of Gongadze was insufficient. The court rejected Melnychenko&#x27;s recordings as evidence. Gongadze&#x27;s widow, Myroslava Gongadze, lodged an appeal against the ruling one week later.

During the trial of Oleksiy Pukach for the murder of Gongadze, he claimed that Kuchma and Kuchma&#x27;s head of his Presidential Administration, Volodymyr Lytvyn, were the ones who ordered the murder. Pukach was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the murder of Gongadze.

First Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin claimed 20 February 2013 that his office had collected enough evidence confirming Kuchma&#x27;s responsibility for ordering Gongadze&#x27;s assassination. Kuchma&#x27;s reply the next day was, &quot;This is another banal example of a provocation, which I&#x27;ve heard more than enough in the past 12 years&quot;.

===2004 Ukrainian presidential election and Orange Revolution===

Kuchma&#x27;s role in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election and subsequent Orange Revolution is not entirely clear. In the run-up to the elections, oligarchs opposed to Leonid Kuchma contributed about $150 million to opposition political parties. According to Michael McFaul, U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014 and architect of Barack Obama&#x27;s policy in the region, the U.S. government spent more than $18 million on &quot;democracy promotion&quot; in the two years leading up to the election. After the second round on 22 November 2004, it appeared that Yanukovych had won the election by fraud, which caused the opposition and independent observers to dispute the results, leading to the Orange Revolution.

Kuchma was urged by Yanukovych and Viktor Medvedchuk (the head of the presidential office) to declare a state of emergency and hold the inauguration of Yanukovych. He denied the request. Later, Yanukovych publicly accused Kuchma of a betrayal. Kuchma refused to officially dismiss Prime Minister Yanukovych after the parliament passed a motion of no confidence against the Cabinet on 1 December 2004. Soon after, Kuchma left the country. He returned to Ukraine in March 2005.

Kuchma said in October 2009 that he would vote for Victor Yanukovych in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election. In a document dated 2 February 2010 and uncovered during the United States diplomatic cables leak, Kuchma, in a conversation with United States Ambassador to Ukraine John F. Tefft, called the voters&#x27; choice between Yanukovych and Yulia Tymoshenko during the second round of the 2010 presidential election as a choice between &quot;bad and very bad&quot; and praised (the candidate eliminated in the first round of the election) Arseniy Yatsenyuk instead.

In September 2011, Kuchma stated that he believed that Yanukovych was the real winner of the 2004 election.

==Post-presidency==
Leonid Kuchma has been active in politics since his presidency ended. He aligned himself with President Viktor Yushchenko in 2005, but later raised concerns about the president in correspondence with then U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, John Tefft. Kuchma endorsed Yanukovych for president in 2010.

=== Involvement in the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine ===

Kuchma represented Ukraine at negotiations with the armed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces on 21 June 2014 to discuss President Petro Poroshenko&#x27;s peace plan. His role as a diplomat was received positively by the west and Russia as well as by the public in Ukraine.

On 11 February 2015, Kuchma was one of the signatories of a draft plan to end the conflict in Donbas. The summit was known as Minsk II. The plan ensured that a ceasefire was implemented; reaction from leaders in Europe was generally positive.

In March 2015, Kuchma delivered an address calling on the west for greater involvement in the region. He criticized the action of Russian-backed forces in the attempt to seize the town of Debaltseve.

In September 2015, Kuchma was again appointed as the representative for Ukraine at the Trilateral Contact Group. The group met in Belarus to discuss ending the conflict in Donbas. In early 2017, Kuchma spoke out against the transport blockade of Donbas. In March 2017 at the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) in Minsk, he demanded that the Russian Federation repeal their decree on the recognition of passports issued in separatist-held areas.

On 2 October 2018, Kuchma stepped down as Ukraine&#x27;s representative in the Trilateral Contact Group due to his age. He returned to the talks in June 2019, at the request of newly elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and after mediation by Victor Pinchuk. According to American sources, he left the post again in July 2020, citing fatigue. He was replaced by Leonid Kravchuk.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===

When Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Kuchma said that he would remain to help defend the country: &quot;I stay at home, in Ukraine, because we are all in our Homeland, there is no other. And we will defend it together until the very victory – without division into party columns, without personal interests and old arguments. United we stand around the Flag, the Army, and the President. Ukraine is not Russia. And it will never become Russia. No matter how hard they want this. We are already winning. And this can’t be stopped. And I will only say to the Russian Federation that I agree with the words of my compatriots who say in one voice: damn you all!&quot;.

In November 2023, Kuchma presented his new book &quot;Ukraine is Not Russia: Twenty Years Later&quot;.

==Family and personal life==
Kuchma has been married to Lyudmyla Talalayeva since 1967. is the Honorary President of the National Fund of Social Protection of Mothers and Children, &quot;Ukraine to Children&quot; and is also known as a paralympic movement in Ukraine supporter.

Kuchma&#x27;s only child, daughter Olena Pinchuk, is married to Viktor Pinchuk, an industrialist and philanthropist whose Victor Pinchuk Foundation regularly hosts Ukraine-dedicated and philanthropic forums at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. Victor Pinchuk made headlines when it was revealed that one of his lobbyists was previously picked by Donald Trump for national security aide.

Kuchma was an amateur guitar player in his younger years. He was also known for his skill at the complicated card game &quot;preferans.&quot;

In 2003, he published his book, .

After retirement, Kuchma was allowed to keep the state-owned dacha in Koncha-Zaspa for his personal use upon completion of his state duties. Government order #15-r, which allowed Kuchma to keep his estate, was signed by acting Prime Minister Mykola Azarov on 19 January 2005. Kuchma was also allowed to keep his full presidential salary and all service personnel, along with two state-owned vehicles. That order also stated that these costs would be paid out of the state budget.

== Legacy ==
Kuchma&#x27;s legacy as President of Ukraine has proven divisive and controversial. He has been commonly referred to as authoritarian, and his attacks on independent media, as well as his economic reforms, have continued to impact Ukraine in the years since he left office.

Kuchma&#x27;s detractors have accused him of establishing the Ukrainian oligarchs with his economic reforms, and many oligarchs entered politics during his presidency, among them Kuchma&#x27;s son-in-law Viktor Pinchuk, Viktor Medvedchuk, Ihor Bakai, Kostyantyn Zhevago and Heorhiy Kirpa.

Kuchma&#x27;s political legacy has also been impactful. Each of his successors except Volodymyr Zelenskyy began their political career under and with the support of Kuchma. Several other politicians, such as Medvedchuk, Volodymyr Lytvyn, Leonid Derkach, Volodymyr Horbulin, and Oleksandr Omelchenko also were promoted by Kuchma during his tenure in office.

Despite numerous human rights abuses during his tenure, such as vote rigging in the 2004 presidential election, and the mysterious deaths of numerous political opponents, among them Gongadze and Viacheslav Chornovil, Kuchma has never been charged with a crime, and numerous attempts to do so have proven unsuccessful.

<text>Liberty Leading the People ( ) is a painting of the Romantic era by the French artist Eugène Delacroix, commemorating the July Revolution of 1830 that toppled King Charles X (&quot;r.&quot; 1824-1830). A bare-breasted “woman of the people” with a Phrygian cap personifying the concept and Goddess of Liberty, accompanied by a young boy brandishing a pistol in each hand, leads a group of various people forward over a barricade and the bodies of the fallen while holding aloft the flag of the French Revolution — the tricolour, which again became France&#x27;s national flag after these events — in one hand, and brandishing a bayonetted musket with the other. The figure of Liberty is also viewed as a symbol of France and the French Republic known as Marianne. The painting is sometimes wrongly thought to depict the French Revolution of 1789.

&quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot; is exhibited in the Louvre in Paris.

==History==
By the time Delacroix painted &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;, he was already the acknowledged leader of the Romantic school in French painting. Delacroix, who was born as the Age of Enlightenment was giving way to the ideas and style of romanticism, rejected the emphasis on precise drawing that characterised the academic art of his time, and instead gave a new prominence to freely brushed colour.

Delacroix painted his work in the autumn of 1830. In a letter to his brother dated 21 October, he wrote: &quot;My bad mood is vanishing thanks to hard work. I&#x27;ve embarked on a modern subject—a barricade. And if I haven&#x27;t fought for my country at least I&#x27;ll paint for her.&quot; The painting was first exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1831.

==Symbolism==
Delacroix depicted Liberty as both an allegorical goddess-figure and a robust woman of the people. The mound of corpses and wreckage acts as a kind of pedestal from which Liberty strides, barefoot and bare-breasted, out of the canvas and into the space of the viewer. The Phrygian cap she wears had come to symbolize liberty during the first French Revolution of 1789. The painting has been seen as a marker to the end of the Age of Enlightenment, as many scholars see the end of the French Revolution as the start of the Romantic era.

The fighters are from a mixture of social classes, ranging from the bourgeoisie represented by the young man in a top hat, a student from the prestigious wearing the traditional bicorne, to the revolutionary urban worker, as exemplified by the boy holding pistols. What they have in common is the fierceness and determination in their eyes. Aside from the flag held by Liberty, a second, minute &quot;tricolore&quot; can be discerned in the distance flying from the towers of Notre-Dame.

The identity of the man in the top hat has been widely debated. The suggestion that it was a self-portrait by Delacroix has been discounted by modern art historians. In the late 19th century, it was suggested the model was the theatre director Étienne Arago; others have suggested the future curator of the Louvre, Frédéric Villot; but there is no firm consensus on this point.

Several of the figures are probably borrowed from a print by popular artist Nicolas Charlet, a prolific illustrator who Delacroix believed captured, more than anyone else, the peculiar energy of the Parisians.

==Purchase and exhibition==
The French government bought the painting in 1831 for 3,000 francs with the intention of displaying it in the throne room of the Palais du Luxembourg as a reminder to the &quot;citizen-king&quot; Louis-Philippe of the July Revolution, through which he had come to power. This plan did not come to fruition and the canvas hung in the palace&#x27;s museum gallery for a few months, before being removed due to its inflammatory political message. After the June Rebellion of 1832, it was returned to the artist. According to Albert Boime,

Champfleury wrote in August 1848 that it had been &quot;hidden in an attic for being too revolutionary.&quot; Although Louis-Philippe&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior initially acquired it as a gesture to the Left, after the uprising at the funeral of Lamarque in June 1832 it was never again openly displayed for fear of setting a bad example. Delacroix was permitted to send the painting to his aunt Félicité for safekeeping. After the Second Republic was established following the revolution of 1848 it was exhibited briefly in that year, and then during the Second Empire in the Salon of 1855. The recently established Third Republic finally acquired the painting in 1874 for the collection of the Musée du Louvre in Paris.

In 1974–75, the painting was the featured work in an exhibition organized by the French government, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Detroit Institute of Arts as a Bicentennial gift to the people of the United States. The exhibition, entitled &quot;French Painting 1774–1830: The Age of Revolution&quot;, marked a rare display of the Delacroix painting, and many of the other 148 works, outside France. The exhibition was first shown at the Grand Palais from 16 November 1974 to 3 February 1975. It moved to Detroit from 5 March to 4 May 1975, then New York from 12 June to 7 September 1975.

In 1999, it was flown on board an Airbus Beluga from Paris to Tokyo via Bahrain and Calcutta in about 20 hours. The large canvas, measuring high by long, was too large to fit into a Boeing 747. It was transported in the vertical position inside a special pressurised container provided with isothermal protection and an anti-vibration device.

In 2012, it was moved to the new Louvre-Lens museum in Lens, Pas-de-Calais, as the starring work in the first tranche of paintings from the Louvre&#x27;s collection to be installed. On 7 February 2013, the painting was vandalized by a visitor in Lens. An unidentified 28-year-old woman allegedly wrote an inscription (&quot;AE911&quot;) on the painting. The woman was immediately arrested by a security guard and a visitor. A short time after the incident, the management of the Louvre and its Pas-de-Calais branch published a press release indicating that &quot;at first glance, the inscription is superficial and should be easily removed&quot;. Louvre officials announced the next day that the writing had been removed in less than two hours by a restorer without damaging the original paint, and the piece returned to display that morning.

In September 2023, officials removed the work from display for its latest conservation and restoration. To prepare, the museum first subjected the painting to X-ray, ultraviolet and infrared analysis. These examinations led to the discovery that many of the painting&#x27;s brilliant colors were muted under several layers of yellowed varnish and dust. The size of the canvas forced conservators to perform all work on-site. 

The restored painting returned to display in April 2024. During their work, restorers discovered several things hidden under eight layers of varnish and dirt. In addition to the vivid white clouds and plumes of smoke, they found the central figure&#x27;s dress was not entirely yellow but originally light grey with bits of gold. They believed this change occurred during restoration work completed in 1949. Also, they discovered a boot in the lower left corner which for many years had blended into the paving stones. 

==Legacy==
Although Delacroix was not the first artist to depict Liberty in a Phrygian cap, his painting may be the best known early version of the figure commonly known as Marianne, a symbol of the French Republic and of France in general.

The painting may have influenced Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1862 novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. In particular, the character of Gavroche is widely believed to have been inspired by the figure of the pistols-wielding boy running over the barricade. The novel describes the events of the June Rebellion two years after the revolution celebrated in the painting, the same rebellion that led to its being removed from public view.

The painting inspired Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&#x27;s &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;, known as the Statue of Liberty in New York City, which was given to the United States as a gift from the French a half-century after &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot; was painted. The statue, which holds a torch in its hand, takes a more stable, immovable stance than that of the woman in the painting. An engraved version of part of the painting, along with a depiction of Delacroix, was featured on the 100 franc note from 1978 to 1995.

The painting has had an influence on classical music. George Antheil titled his Symphony No. 6 &quot;After Delacroix&quot;, and stated that the work was inspired by &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;. The imagery was adapted by Robert Ballagh to commemorate Ireland&#x27;s independence struggle on an Irish postage stamp in 1979, the centenary of the birth of Pádraig Pearse, and the painting was used for the band Coldplay&#x27;s 2008 album cover &quot;Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends&quot;, with the words &quot;Viva La Vida&quot; written in white. Rigoberta Bandini references the painting in the chorus of her 2021 song Ay mamá. The cover of the 2010 book &quot;Enough is Enough: How to Build a New Republic&quot; by Fintan O&#x27;Toole references the painting, but with Kathleen Ni Houlihan holding the Irish tricolour in Dublin while the leaders of the three main political parties at the time (Brian Cowen, Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore) lie on the ground.

During the 20 October 2011 episode of the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;In Our Time&quot;, host Melvyn Bragg led a panel discussion of the painting.

&quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot; made an appearance in the 11th episode (&quot;EDGELORD – Revolution of the 14-Year-Olds&quot;) of the Netflix animation series &quot;Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045&quot;.

The painting was featured in &quot;Vincenzo&quot;, a 2021 South Korean TV series starring Song Joong-ki in episode 7. 

A photograph of Aed Abu Amro taken during the 2018–2019 Gaza border protests by Mustafa Hassona on 22 October 2018, was considered by some a personification of the &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;.

The artwork makes a prominent appearance in the 2023 film John Wick: Chapter 4 where the main antagonist is seen standing before the painting inside the Louvre, which was notably closed to the public for the filming of the scenes.

Actors recreated the painting during the Opening Ceremonies of the 2024 Olympics at the Conciergerie. During the recreation, they were accompanied by the French version of &quot;Do You Hear The People Sing?&quot; from &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

<text>A nuclear and radiation accident is defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as &quot;an event that has led to significant consequences to people, the environment or the facility.&quot; Examples include lethal effects to individuals, large radioactivity release to the environment, or a reactor core melt. The prime example of a &quot;major nuclear accident&quot; is one in which a reactor core is damaged and significant amounts of radioactive isotopes are released, such as in the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.

The impact of nuclear accidents has been a topic of debate since the first nuclear reactors were constructed in 1954 and has been a key factor in public concern about nuclear facilities. Technical measures to reduce the risk of accidents or to minimize the amount of radioactivity released to the environment have been adopted; however, human error remains, and &quot;there have been many accidents with varying impacts as well near misses and incidents&quot;. As of 2014, there have been more than 100 serious nuclear accidents and incidents from the use of nuclear power. Fifty-seven accidents or severe incidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and about 60% of all nuclear-related accidents/severe incidents have occurred in the USA. Serious nuclear power plant accidents include the Fukushima nuclear disaster (2011), the Chernobyl disaster (1986), the Three Mile Island accident (1979), and the SL-1 accident (1961). Nuclear power accidents can involve loss of life and large monetary costs for remediation work.

Nuclear submarine accidents include the &quot;K-19&quot; (1961), &quot;K-11&quot; (1965), &quot;K-27&quot; (1968), &quot;K-140&quot; (1968), &quot;K-429&quot; (1970), &quot;K-222&quot; (1980), and &quot;K-431&quot; (1985) accidents. Serious radiation incidents/accidents include the Kyshtym disaster, the Windscale fire, the radiotherapy accident in Costa Rica, the radiotherapy accident in Zaragoza, the radiation accident in Morocco, the Goiania accident, the radiation accident in Mexico City, the Samut Prakan radiation accident, and the Mayapuri radiological accident in India.

The IAEA maintains a website reporting recent nuclear accidents.

In 2020, the WHO stated that &quot;Lessons learned from past radiological and nuclear accidents have demonstrated that the mental health and psychosocial consequences can outweigh the direct physical health impacts of radiation exposure.&quot;&quot;

==Nuclear plant accidents==
The world&#x27;s first nuclear reactor meltdown was the NRX reactor at Chalk River Laboratories, Ontario, Canada in 1952.

The worst nuclear accident to date is the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 in the Ukrainian SSR, now Ukraine. The accident killed approximately 30 people directly and damaged approximately $7 billion of property. A study published in 2005 by the World Health Organization estimates that there may eventually be up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident among those exposed to significant radiation levels. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Other studies have estimated as many as over a million eventual cancer deaths from Chernobyl. Estimates of eventual deaths from cancer are highly contested. Industry, UN and DOE agencies claim low numbers of legally provable cancer deaths will be traceable to the disaster. The UN, DOE and industry agencies all use the limits of the epidemiological resolvable deaths as the cutoff below which they cannot be legally proven to come from the disaster. Independent studies statistically calculate fatal cancers from dose and population, even though the number of additional cancers will be below the epidemiological threshold of measurement of around 1%. These are two very different concepts and lead to the huge variations in estimates. Both are reasonable projections with different meanings. Approximately 350,000 people were forcibly resettled away from these areas soon after the accident. 6,000 people were involved in cleaning Chernobyl and were contaminated.

Social scientist and energy policy expert, Benjamin K. Sovacool has reported that worldwide there have been 99 accidents at nuclear power plants from 1952 to 2009 (defined as incidents that either resulted in the loss of human life or more than US$50,000 of property damage, the amount the US federal government uses to define major energy accidents that must be reported), totaling US$20.5 billion in property damages. There have been comparatively few fatalities associated with nuclear power plant accidents. An academic review of many reactor accident and the phenomena of these events was published by Mark Foreman.

=== List of nuclear plant accidents and incidents ===


==Nuclear reactor attacks==
The vulnerability of nuclear plants to deliberate attack is of concern in the area of nuclear safety and security. Nuclear power plants, civilian research reactors, certain naval fuel facilities, uranium enrichment plants, fuel fabrication plants, and potentially even uranium mines are vulnerable to attacks which could lead to widespread radioactive contamination. The attack threat is of several general types: commando-like ground-based attacks on equipment which if disabled could lead to a reactor core meltdown or widespread dispersal of radioactivity, external attacks such as an aircraft crash into a reactor complex, or cyber attacks.

The United States 9/11 Commission found that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered as part of the September 11 attacks. If terrorist groups could sufficiently damage safety systems to cause a core meltdown at a nuclear power plant, or sufficiently damage spent fuel pools, such an attack could lead to widespread radioactive contamination. The Federation of American Scientists have said that if nuclear power use is to expand significantly, nuclear facilities will have to be made extremely safe from attacks that could release radioactivity into the environment. New reactor designs have features of passive nuclear safety, which may help. In the United States, the NRC carries out &quot;Force on Force&quot; (FOF) exercises at all Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) sites at least once every three years.

Nuclear reactors become preferred targets during military conflict and have been repeatedly attacked during military air strikes, occupations, invasions and campaigns over the period 1980–2007. Various acts of civil disobedience since 1980 by the peace group Plowshares have shown how nuclear weapons facilities can be penetrated, and the group&#x27;s actions represent extraordinary breaches of security at nuclear weapons plants in the United States. The National Nuclear Security Administration has acknowledged the seriousness of the 2012 Plowshares action. Non-proliferation policy experts have questioned &quot;the use of private contractors to provide security at facilities that manufacture and store the government&#x27;s most dangerous military material&quot;. Nuclear weapons materials on the black market are a global concern,&lt;ref name=&quot;A Nuclear 9/11&quot;&gt;Brian Michael Jenkins. A Nuclear 9/11? &quot;CNN.com&quot;, September 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is concern about the possible detonation of a small, crude nuclear weapon or dirty bomb by a militant group in a major city, causing significant loss of life and property.

The number and sophistication of cyber attacks is on the rise. Stuxnet is a computer worm discovered in June 2010 that is believed to have been created by the United States and Israel to attack Iran&#x27;s nuclear facilities. It switched off safety devices, causing centrifuges to spin out of control. The computers of South Korea&#x27;s nuclear plant operator (KHNP) were hacked in December 2014. The cyber attacks involved thousands of phishing emails containing malicious codes, and information was stolen.

In March 2022, the Battle of Enerhodar caused damage to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and a fire at its training complex as Russian forces took control, heightening concerns of nuclear contamination. On September 6, 2022, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi addressed the UN Security Council, calling for a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant and reiterating his findings that &quot;the Seven Pillars [for nuclear safety and security] have all been compromised at the site.&quot;

==Radiation and other accidents and incidents==




Serious radiation and other accidents and incidents include:
;1940s
*May 1945: Albert Stevens was one of several subjects of a human radiation experiment, and was injected with plutonium without his knowledge or informed consent. Although Stevens was the person who received the highest dose of radiation during the plutonium experiments, he was neither the first nor the last subject to be studied. Eighteen people aged 4 to 69 were injected with plutonium. Subjects who were chosen for the experiment had been diagnosed with a terminal disease. They lived from 6 days up to 44 years past the time of their injection. Eight of the 18 died within two years of the injection. Although one cause of death was unknown, a report by William Moss and Roger Eckhardt concluded that there was &quot;no evidence that any of the patients died for reasons that could be attributed to the plutonium injections. Patients from Rochester, Chicago, and Oak Ridge were also injected with plutonium in the Manhattan Project human experiments.
*6–9 August 1945: On the orders of President Harry S. Truman, a uranium-gun design bomb, Little Boy, was used against the city of Hiroshima, Japan. Fat Man, a plutonium implosion-design bomb was used against the city of Nagasaki. The two weapons killed approximately 120,000 to 140,000 civilians and military personnel instantly and thousands more have died over the years from radiation sickness and related cancers.
*August 1945: Criticality accident at US Los Alamos National Laboratory. Harry Daghlian dies.
*May 1946: Criticality accident at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Louis Slotin dies.
;1950s
*13 February 1950: a Convair B-36B crashed in northern British Columbia after jettisoning a Mark IV atomic bomb. This was the first such nuclear weapon loss in history.
*12 December 1952: NRX AECL Chalk River Laboratories, Chalk River, Ontario, Canada. Partial meltdown, about 10,000 Curies released. Approximately 1202 people were involved in the two-year cleanup. Future president Jimmy Carter was one of the many people that helped clean up the accident.
*15 March 1953: Mayak, former Soviet Union. Criticality accident. Contamination of plant personnel occurred.
*1 March 1954: The 15 Mt Castle Bravo shot of 1954 which spread considerable nuclear fallout on many Pacific islands, including several which were inhabited, and some that had not been evacuated.
**1 March 1954: &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot;, Japanese fishing vessel contaminated by fallout from Castle Bravo, 1 fatality.
**2 March 1954: US Navy tanker contaminated by fallout from Castle Bravo while sailing from Enewetak Atoll to Pearl Harbor.
*September 1957: a plutonium fire occurred at the Rocky Flats Plant, which resulted in the contamination of Building 71 and the release of plutonium into the atmosphere, causing US$818,600 in damage.
*21 May 1957: Mayak, former Soviet Union. Criticality accident in the factory number 20 in the collection oxalate decantate after filtering sediment oxalate enriched uranium. Six people received doses of 300 to 1,000 rem (four women and two men), one woman died.
*29 September 1957: Kyshtym disaster: Nuclear waste storage tank explosion at the same Mayak plant, Russia. No immediate fatalities, though up to 200+ additional cancer deaths might have ensued from the radioactive contamination of the surrounding area; 270,000 people were exposed to dangerous radiation levels. Over thirty small communities were removed from Soviet maps between 1958 and 1991. (INES level 6)
*October 1957: Windscale fire, UK. Fire ignites a &quot;plutonium pile&quot; (an air cooled, graphite moderated, uranium fuelled reactor that was used for plutonium and isotope production) and contaminates surrounding dairy farms. An estimated 33 cancer deaths.
*1957-1964: Rocketdyne located at the Santa Susanna Field Lab, 30 miles north of Los Angeles, California operated ten experimental nuclear reactors. Numerous accidents occurred including a core meltdown. Experimental reactors of that era were not required to have the same type of containment structures that shield modern nuclear reactors. During the Cold War time in which the accidents that occurred at Rocketdyne, these events were not publicly reported by the Department of Energy.
*1958: Fuel rupture and fire at the National Research Universal reactor (NRU), Chalk River, Canada.
*10 February 1958: Mayak, former Soviet Union. Criticality accident in SCR plant. Conducted experiments to determine the critical mass of enriched uranium in a cylindrical container with different concentrations of uranium in solution. Staff broke the rules and instructions for working with YADM (nuclear fissile material). When SCR personnel received doses from 7,600 to 13,000 rem. Three people died, one man got radiation sickness and went blind.
*15 October 1958: Vinča, Yugoslavia. There was a criticality incident in a newly installed reactor. Six young researchers received high doses of radiation, and were subsequently treated at &quot;Kiri&quot; institute in Paris where one of them died.
*30 December 1958: Cecil Kelley criticality accident at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
*March 1959: Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Los Angeles, California. Fire in a fuel processing facility.
*July 1959: Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Los Angeles, California. Partial meltdown.
*October 15, 1959, a B-52 carrying two nuclear weapons collided in midair with a KC-135 tanker near Hardinsburg, Kentucky. One of the nuclear bombs was damaged by fire but both weapons were recovered.
;1960&#x27;s
*7 June 1960: the 1960 Fort Dix IM-99 accident destroyed a CIM-10 Bomarc nuclear missile and shelter and contaminated the BOMARC Missile Accident Site in New Jersey.
*24 January 1961: the 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash occurred near Goldsboro, North Carolina. A B-52 Stratofortress carrying two Mark 39 nuclear bombs broke up in mid-air, dropping its nuclear payload in the process.
*July 1961: soviet submarine K-19 accident. Eight fatalities and more than 30 people were over-exposed to radiation.
* July 6, 1962 Sedan nuclear test accidentally released 33 PBq of radioactive iodine-131 and other radioactive material.
*21 March–August 1962: radiation accident in Mexico City, four fatalities.
*23 July 1964: Wood River Junction criticality accident. Resulted in 1 fatality
*1964, 1969: Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Los Angeles, California. Partial meltdowns.
*1965 Philippine Sea A-4 crash, where a Skyhawk attack aircraft with a nuclear weapon fell into the sea. The pilot, the aircraft, and the B43 nuclear bomb were never recovered. It was not until the 1980s that the Pentagon revealed the loss of the one-megaton bomb.
*October 1965: US CIA-led expedition abandons a nuclear-powered telemetry relay listening device on Nanda Devi
*17 January 1966: the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash occurred when a B-52G bomber of the USAF collided with a KC-135 tanker during mid-air refuelling off the coast of Spain. The KC-135 was completely destroyed when its fuel load ignited, killing all four crew members. The B-52G broke apart, killing three of the seven crew members aboard. Of the four Mk28 type hydrogen bombs the B-52G carried, three were found on land near Almería, Spain. The non-nuclear explosives in two of the weapons detonated upon impact with the ground, resulting in the contamination of a (0.78 square mile) area by radioactive plutonium. The fourth, which fell into the Mediterranean Sea, was recovered intact after a 2-month-long search.
*21 January 1968: the 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash involved a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52 bomber. The aircraft was carrying four hydrogen bombs when a cabin fire forced the crew to abandon the aircraft. Six crew members ejected safely, but one who did not have an ejection seat was killed while trying to bail out. The bomber crashed onto sea ice in Greenland, causing the nuclear payload to rupture and disperse, which resulted in widespread radioactive contamination.
*May 1968: Soviet submarine K-27 reactor near meltdown. 9 people died, 83 people were injured.
*In August 1968: Soviet nuclear ballistic missile submarine development program Project 667A. Nuclear-powered Yankee class submarine K-140 was in the naval yard at Severodvinsk for repairs. On August 27, an uncontrolled increase of the reactor&#x27;s power occurred following work to upgrade the vessel. One of the reactors started up automatically when the control rods were raised to a higher position. Power increased to 18 times its normal amount, while pressure and temperature levels in the reactor increased to four times the normal amount. The automatic start-up of the reactor was caused by the incorrect installation of the control rod electrical cables and by operator error. Radiation levels aboard the vessel deteriorated.
*10 December 1968: Mayak, former Soviet Union. Criticality accident. Plutonium solution was poured into a cylindrical container with dangerous geometry. One person died, another took a high dose of radiation and radiation sickness, after which he had two legs and his right arm amputated.
*January 1969: Lucens reactor in Switzerland undergoes partial core meltdown leading to massive radioactive contamination of a cavern.
;1970s
*1974–1976: Columbus radiotherapy accident, 10 fatalities, 88 injuries from cobalt-60 source.
*July 1978: Anatoli Bugorski was working on U-70, the largest Soviet particle accelerator, when he accidentally exposed his head directly to the proton beam. He survived, despite suffering some long-term damage.
*July 1979: Church Rock Uranium Mill Spill in New Mexico, USA, when United Nuclear Corporation&#x27;s uranium mill tailings disposal pond breached its dam. Over 1,000 tons of radioactive mill waste and millions of gallons of mine effluent flowed into the Puerco River, and contaminants traveled downstream.
;1980s
*1980 to 1989: The Kramatorsk radiological accident happened in Kramatorsk, Ukrainian SSR. In 1989, a small capsule containing highly radioactive caesium-137 was found inside the concrete wall of an apartment building. 6 residents of the building died from leukemia and 18 more received varying radiation doses. The accident was detected only after the residents called in a health physicist.
*1980: Houston radiotherapy accident, 7 fatalities.
*5 October 1982: Lost radiation source, Baku, Azerbaijan, USSR. 5 fatalities, 13 injuries.
*March 1984: Radiation accident in Morocco, eight fatalities from overexposure to radiation from a lost iridium-192 source.
*1984: 
**Fernald Feed Materials Production Center gained notoriety when it was learned that the plant was releasing millions of pounds of uranium dust into the atmosphere, causing major radioactive contamination of the surrounding areas. That same year, employee Dave Bocks, a 39-year-old pipefitter, disappeared during the facility&#x27;s graveyard shift and was later reported missing. Eventually, his remains were discovered inside a uranium processing furnace located in Plant 6.
**The Ciudad Juárez cobalt-60 contamination incident happened after a private medical company that had illegally purchased a radiation therapy unit sold it to a junkyard to be later smelted to produce rebar. These were distributed and used in multiple cities across Mexico and the United States and exposed an estimated four thousand people to radiation.
*1985 to 1987: The Therac-25 accidents. A radiation therapy machine was involved in six accidents, in which patients were exposed to massive overdoses of radiation. 4 fatalities, 2 injuries.
*August 1985: Soviet submarine K-431 accident. Ten fatalities and 49 other people suffered radiation injuries.
*4 January 1986: an overloaded tank at Sequoyah Fuels Corporation ruptured and released 14.5 tons of uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6), causing the death of a worker, the hospitalization of 37 other workers, and approximately 100 downwinders.
*26 April 1986: Chernobyl disaster: Two killed by debris and 28 killed by acute radiation sickness after human error caused the meltdown of a reactor. 
*October 1986: Soviet submarine K-219 reactor almost had a meltdown. Sergei Preminin died after he manually lowered the control rods, and stopped the explosion. The submarine sank three days later.
*September 1987: Goiania accident. Four fatalities, and following radiological screening of more than 100,000 people, it was ascertained that 249 people received serious radiation contamination from exposure to caesium-137. In the cleanup operation, topsoil had to be removed from several sites, and several houses were demolished. All the objects from within those houses were removed and examined. &quot;Time&quot; magazine has identified the accident as one of the world&#x27;s &quot;worst nuclear disasters&quot; and the International Atomic Energy Agency called it &quot;one of the world&#x27;s worst radiological incidents&quot;.
*1989: San Salvador, El Salvador; one fatality due to violation of safety rules at cobalt-60 irradiation facility.

;1990s
*1990: Soreq, Israel; one fatality due to violation of safety rules at cobalt-60 irradiation facility.
*December 16, 1990: radiotherapy accident in Zaragoza. Eleven fatalities and 27 other patients were injured.
*1991: Neswizh, Belarus; one fatality due to violation of safety rules at cobalt-60 irradiation facility.
*1992: Jilin, China; three fatalities at cobalt-60 irradiation facility.
*1992: USA; one fatality.
*April 1993: accident at the Tomsk-7 Reprocessing Complex, when a tank exploded while being cleaned with nitric acid. The explosion released a cloud of radioactive gas. (INES level 4).
*1994: Tammiku, Estonia; one fatality from disposed caesium-137 source.
*August — December 1996: Radiotherapy accident in Costa Rica. Thirteen fatalities and 114 other patients received an overdose of radiation.
*1996: an accident at Pelindaba research facility in South Africa results in the exposure of workers to radiation. Harold Daniels and several others die from cancers and radiation burns related to the exposure.
*June 1997: Sarov, Russia; one fatality due to violation of safety rules.
*May 1998: The Acerinox accident was an incident of radioactive contamination in Southern Spain. A caesium-137 source managed to pass through the monitoring equipment in an Acerinox scrap metal reprocessing plant. When melted, the caesium-137 caused the release of a radioactive cloud.
*September 1999: two fatalities at criticality accident at Tokaimura nuclear accident (Japan)
;2000s
*January–February 2000: Samut Prakan radiation accident: three deaths and ten injuries resulted in Samut Prakan when a cobalt-60 radiation-therapy unit was dismantled.
*May 2000: Meet Halfa, Egypt; two fatalities due to radiography accident.
*August 2000 – March 2001: Instituto Oncologico Nacional of Panama, 17 fatalities. Patients receiving treatment for prostate cancer and cancer of the cervix receive lethal doses of radiation.
*9 August 2004: Mihama Nuclear Power Plant accident, 4 fatalities. Hot water and steam leaked from a broken pipe (not actually a radiation accident).
*9 May 2005: it was announced that the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant at Sellafield in the UK suffered a leak of a highly radioactive solution, into secondary containment.
;2010s
*April 2010: Mayapuri radiological accident, India, one fatality after a cobalt-60 research irradiator was sold to a scrap metal dealer and dismantled.
*March 2011: Fukushima I nuclear accidents, Japan and the radioactive discharge at the Fukushima Daiichi Power Station.
*17 January 2014: At the Rössing Uranium Mine, Namibia, a catastrophic structural failure of a leach tank resulted in a major spill. The France-based laboratory, CRIIRAD, reported elevated levels of radioactive materials in the area surrounding the mine. Workers were not informed of the dangers of working with radioactive materials and the health effects thereof.
*1 February 2014: Designed to last ten thousand years, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) site approximately 26 miles (42 km) east of Carlsbad, New Mexico, United States, had its first leak of airborne radioactive materials. 140 employees working underground at the time were sheltered indoors. Thirteen of these tested positive for internal radioactive contamination increasing their risk for future cancers or health issues. A second leak at the plant occurred shortly after the first, releasing plutonium and other radiotoxins causing concern to nearby communities. The source of the drum rupture has been traced to the use of organic kitty litter at the WCRRF packaging facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where the drum was packaged and prepared for shipment.
*8 August 2019: Nyonoksa radiation accident at the State Central Navy Testing Range at Nyonoksa, near Severodvinsk, Russia.

==Worldwide nuclear weapons testing summary==


Between 16 July 1945 and 23 September 1992, the United States maintained a program of vigorous nuclear weapons testing, with the exception of a moratorium between November 1958 and September 1961. By official count, a total of 1,054 nuclear tests and two nuclear attacks were conducted, with over 100 of them taking place at sites in the Pacific Ocean, over 900 of them at the Nevada Test Site, and ten on miscellaneous sites in the United States (Alaska, Colorado, Mississippi, and New Mexico). Until November 1962, the vast majority of the U.S. tests were atmospheric (that is, above-ground); after the acceptance of the Partial Test Ban Treaty all testing was regulated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout.

The U.S. program of atmospheric nuclear testing exposed a number of the population to the hazards of fallout. Estimating exact numbers, and the exact consequences, of people exposed has been medically very difficult, with the exception of the high exposures of Marshall Islanders and Japanese fishers in the case of the Castle Bravo incident in 1954. A number of groups of U.S. citizens — especially farmers and inhabitants of cities downwind of the Nevada Test Site and U.S. military workers at various tests — have sued for compensation and recognition of their exposure, many successfully. The passage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 allowed for a systematic filing of compensation claims in relation to testing as well as those employed at nuclear weapons facilities. As of June 2009 over $1.4 billion total has been given in compensation, with over $660 million going to &quot;downwinders&quot;.
==Trafficking and thefts==

The International Atomic Energy Agency says there is &quot;a persistent problem with the illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials, thefts, losses and other unauthorized activities&quot;. The IAEA Illicit Nuclear Trafficking Database notes 1,266 incidents reported by 99 countries over the last 12 years, including 18 incidents involving HEU or plutonium trafficking:

*Security specialist Shaun Gregory argued in an article that terrorists have attacked Pakistani nuclear facilities three times in the recent past; twice in 2007 and once in 2008.
*In November 2007, burglars with unknown intentions infiltrated the Pelindaba nuclear research facility near Pretoria, South Africa. The burglars escaped without acquiring any of the uranium held at the facility.
*In February 2006, Oleg Khinsagov of Russia was arrested in Georgia, along with three Georgian accomplices, with 79.5 grams of 89 percent enriched HEU.
*The Alexander Litvinenko poisoning in November 2006 with radioactive polonium &quot;represents an ominous landmark: the beginning of an era of nuclear terrorism,&quot; according to Andrew J. Patterson.

==Accident categories==
===Nuclear meltdown===

A nuclear meltdown is a severe nuclear reactor accident that results in reactor core damage from overheating. It has been defined as the accidental melting of the core of a nuclear reactor, and refers to the core&#x27;s either complete or partial collapse. A core melt accident occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems to the point where at least one nuclear fuel element exceeds its melting point. This differs from a fuel element failure, which is not caused by high temperatures. A meltdown may be caused by a loss of coolant, loss of coolant pressure, or low coolant flow rate or be the result of a criticality excursion in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits. Alternately, an external fire may endanger the core, leading to a meltdown.

Large-scale nuclear meltdowns at civilian nuclear power plants include:

*the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania, United States, in 1979.
*the Chernobyl disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, USSR, in 1986.
*the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster following the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, March 2011.

Other core meltdowns have occurred at:
*NRX (military), Ontario, Canada, in 1952
*BORAX-I (experimental), Idaho, United States, in 1954
*EBR-I, Idaho, United States, in 1955
*Windscale (military), Sellafield, England, in 1957 (see Windscale fire)
*Sodium Reactor Experiment, Santa Susana Field Laboratory (civilian), California, United States, in 1959
*Fermi 1 (civilian), Michigan, United States, in 1966
*Chapelcross nuclear power station (civilian), Scotland, in 1967
*the Lucens reactor, Switzerland, in 1969.
*Saint-Laurent Nuclear Power Plant (civilian), France, in 1969
*A1 plant, (civilian) at Jaslovské Bohunice, Czechoslovakia, in 1977
*Saint-Laurent Nuclear Power Plant (civilian), France, in 1980
*Several Soviet Navy nuclear submarines have had nuclear core melts: K-19 (1961), K-11(1965), K-27 (1968), K-140 (1968), K-222 (1980), and K-431 (1985).

===Criticality accidents===
A criticality accident (also sometimes referred to as an &quot;excursion&quot; or &quot;power excursion&quot;) occurs when a nuclear chain reaction is accidentally allowed to occur in fissile material, such as enriched uranium or plutonium. The Chernobyl accident is not universally regarded an example of a criticality accident, because it occurred in an operating reactor at a power plant. The reactor was supposed to be in a controlled critical state, but control of the chain reaction was lost. The accident destroyed the reactor and left a large geographic area uninhabitable. In a smaller scale accident at Sarov a technician working with highly enriched uranium was irradiated while preparing an experiment involving a sphere of fissile material. The Sarov accident is interesting because the system remained critical for many days before it could be stopped, though safely located in a shielded experimental hall. This is an example of a limited scope accident where only a few people can be harmed, while no release of radioactivity into the environment occurred. A criticality accident with limited off site release of both radiation (gamma and neutron) and a very small release of radioactivity occurred at Tokaimura in 1999 during the production of enriched uranium fuel. Two workers died, a third was permanently injured, and 350 citizens were exposed to radiation. In 2016, a criticality accident was reported at the Afrikantov OKBM Critical Test Facility in Russia.

===Decay heat===
Decay heat accidents are where the heat generated by radioactive decay causes harm. In a large nuclear reactor, a loss of coolant accident can damage the core: for example, at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station a recent shutdown (SCRAMed) PWR reactor was left for a length of time without cooling water. As a result, the nuclear fuel was damaged, and the core partially melted. The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor safety concern, especially shortly after shutdown. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, and the heat is often dissipated to an &#x27;ultimate heat sink&#x27; which has a large capacity and requires no active power, though this method is typically used after decay heat has reduced to a very small value. The main cause of the release of radioactivity in the Three Mile Island accident was a pilot-operated relief valve on the primary loop which stuck in the open position. This caused the overflow tank into which it drained to rupture and release large amounts of radioactive cooling water into the containment building.

For the most part, nuclear facilities receive their power from offsite electrical systems. They also have a grid of emergency backup generators to provide power in the event of an outage. An event that could prevent both offsite power, as well as emergency power is known as a &quot;station blackout&quot;. In 2011, an earthquake and tsunami caused a loss of electric power at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan (via severing the connection to the external grid and destroying the backup diesel generators). The decay heat could not be removed, and the reactor cores of units 1, 2 and 3 overheated, the nuclear fuel melted, and the containments were breached. Radioactive materials were released from the plant to the atmosphere and to the ocean.

===Transport===

Transport accidents can cause a release of radioactivity resulting in contamination or shielding to be damaged resulting in direct irradiation. In Cochabamba a defective gamma radiography set was transported in a passenger bus as cargo. The gamma source was outside the shielding, and it irradiated some bus passengers.

In the United Kingdom, it was revealed in a court case that in March 2002 a radiotherapy source was transported from Leeds to Sellafield with defective shielding. The shielding had a gap on the underside. It is thought that no human has been seriously harmed by the escaping radiation.

On 17 January 1966, a fatal collision occurred between a B-52G and a KC-135 Stratotanker over Palomares, Spain (see 1966 Palomares B-52 crash). The accident was designated a &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, meaning an accident involving a nuclear weapon that does not present a risk of war.

===Equipment failure===
Equipment failure is one possible type of accident. In Białystok, Poland, in 2001 the electronics associated with a particle accelerator used for the treatment of cancer suffered a malfunction. This then led to the overexposure of at least one patient. While the initial failure was the simple failure of a semiconductor diode, it set in motion a series of events which led to a radiation injury.

A related cause of accidents is failure of control software, as in the cases involving the Therac-25 medical radiotherapy equipment: the elimination of a hardware safety interlock in a new design model exposed a previously undetected bug in the control software, which could have led to patients receiving massive overdoses under a specific set of conditions.

===Human error===

Some major nuclear accidents were attributable in part to operator or human error. At Chernobyl, operators deviated from test procedure and allowed certain reactor parameters to exceed design limits. At TMI-2, operators permitted thousands of gallons of water to escape from the reactor plant before observing that the coolant pumps were behaving abnormally. The coolant pumps were thus turned off to protect the pumps, which in turn led to the destruction of the reactor itself as cooling was completely lost within the core.

A detailed investigation into SL-1 determined that one operator (perhaps inadvertently) manually pulled the central control rod out about 26 inches rather than the maintenance procedure&#x27;s intention of about 4 inches.

An assessment conducted by the Commissariat à l&#x27;Énergie Atomique (CEA) in France concluded that no amount of technical innovation can eliminate the risk of human-induced errors associated with the operation of nuclear power plants. Two types of mistakes were deemed most serious: errors committed during field operations, such as maintenance and testing, that can cause an accident; and human errors made during small accidents that cascade to complete failure.

In 1946 Canadian Manhattan Project physicist Louis Slotin performed a risky experiment known as &quot;tickling the dragon&#x27;s tail&quot; which involved two hemispheres of neutron-reflective beryllium being brought together around a plutonium core to bring it to criticality. Against operating procedures, the hemispheres were separated only by a screwdriver. The screwdriver slipped and set off a chain reaction criticality accident filling the room with harmful radiation and a flash of blue light (caused by excited, ionized air particles returning to their unexcited states). Slotin reflexively separated the hemispheres in reaction to the heat flash and blue light, preventing further irradiation of several co-workers present in the room. However, Slotin absorbed a lethal dose of the radiation and died nine days later. The infamous plutonium mass used in the experiment was referred to as the demon core.

===Lost source===

Lost source accidents, also referred to as orphan sources, are incidents in which a radioactive source is lost, stolen or abandoned. The source then might cause harm to humans. The best known example of this type of event is the 1987 Goiânia accident in Brazil, when a radiotherapy source was forgotten and abandoned in a hospital, to be later stolen and opened by scavengers. A similar case occurred in 2000 in Samut Prakan, Thailand when the radiation source of an expired teletherapy unit was sold unregistered, and stored in an unguarded car park from which it was stolen. Other cases occurred at Yanango, Peru where a radiography source was lost, and Gilan, Iran where a radiography source harmed a welder.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has provided guides for scrap metal collectors on what a sealed source might look like. The scrap metal industry is the one where lost sources are most likely to be found.

Experts believe that up to 50 nuclear weapons were lost during the Cold War.

==Comparisons==

Comparing the historical safety record of civilian nuclear energy with other forms of electrical generation, Ball, Roberts, and Simpson, the IAEA, and the Paul Scherrer Institute found in separate studies that during the period from 1970 to 1992, there were just 39 on-the-job deaths of nuclear power plant workers worldwide, while during the same time period, there were 6,400 on-the-job deaths of coal power plant workers, 1,200 on-the-job deaths of natural gas power plant workers and members of the general public caused by natural gas power plants, and 4,000 deaths of members of the general public caused by hydroelectric power plants with failure of Banqiao Dam in 1975 resulting in 170,000-230,000 fatalities alone.

As other common sources of energy, coal power plants are estimated to kill 24,000 Americans per year due to lung disease as well as causing 40,000 heart attacks per year in the United States. According to &quot;Scientific American&quot;, the average coal power plant emits 100 times more radiation per year than a comparatively sized nuclear power plant in the form of toxic coal waste known as fly ash.

In terms of energy accidents, hydroelectric plants were responsible for the most fatalities, but nuclear power plant accidents rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage. Oil and hydroelectric follow at around 25 percent each, followed by natural gas at 9 percent and coal at 2 percent. Excluding Chernobyl and the Shimantan Dam, the three other most expensive accidents involved the Exxon Valdez oil spill (Alaska), the Prestige oil spill (Spain), and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident (Pennsylvania).

==Nuclear safety==
Nuclear safety covers the actions taken to prevent nuclear and radiation accidents or to limit their consequences and damage to the environment. This covers nuclear power plants as well as all other nuclear facilities, the transportation of nuclear materials, and the use and storage of nuclear materials for medical, power, industry, and military uses.

The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly. Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety. Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.

In his book &quot;Normal Accidents&quot;, Charles Perrow says that unexpected failures are built into society&#x27;s complex and tightly coupled nuclear reactor systems. Nuclear power plants cannot be operated without some major accidents. Such accidents are unavoidable and cannot be designed around. An interdisciplinary team from MIT have estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 to 2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period. There have been five serious accidents (core damage) in the world since 1970 (one at Three Mile Island in 1979; one at Chernobyl in 1986; and three at Fukushima-Daiichi in 2011), corresponding to the beginning of the operation of generation II reactors. This leads to on average one serious accident happening every eight years worldwide.

When nuclear reactors begin to age, they require more exhaustive monitoring and preventive maintenance and tests to operate safely and prevent accidents. However, these measures can be costly, and some reactor owners have not followed these recommendations. Most of the existing nuclear infrastructure in use is old due to these reasons.

To combat accidents associated with aging nuclear power plants, it may be advantageous to build new nuclear power reactors and retire the old nuclear plants. In the United States alone, more than 50 start-up companies are working to create innovative designs for nuclear power plants while ensuring the plants are more affordable and cost-effective.

== Ecological impacts ==

=== Impact on land ===
Isotopes released during a meltdown or related event are typically dispersed into the atmosphere and then settle on the surface through natural occurrences and deposition. Isotopes settling on the top soil layer can remain there for many years, due to their slow decay (long half-life). The long-term detrimental effects on agriculture, farming, and livestock, can potentially affect human health and safety long after the actual event.

After the Fukushima Daiichi accident in 2011, surrounding agricultural areas were contaminated with more than 100,000 MBq km−2 in cesium concentrations. As a result, eastern Fukushima food production was severely limited. Due to Japan&#x27;s topography and the local weather patterns, cesium deposits as well as other isotopes reside in top layer of soils all over eastern and northeastern Japan. Luckily, mountain ranges have shielded western Japan.

The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 exposed to radiation about 125,000 mi2 (320,000 km2) of land across Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. The amount of focused radiation caused severe damage to plant reproduction: most plants could not reproduce for at least three years. Many of these occurrences on land can be a result of the distribution of radioactive isotopes through water systems.

=== Impact on water ===

==== Fukushima Daiichi accident ====
In 2013, contaminated groundwater was found in between some of the affected turbine buildings in the Fukushima Daiichi facility, including locations at bordering seaports on the Pacific Ocean. In both locations, the facility typically releases clean water to feed into further groundwater systems. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the entity that manages and operates the facility, further investigated the contamination in areas that would be deemed safe to conduct operations. They found that a significant amount of the contamination originated from underground cable trenches that connected to circulation pumps within the facility. Both the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and TEPCO confirmed that this contamination was a result of the 2011 earthquake. Due to damage like this, the Fukushima plant released nuclear material into the Pacific Ocean and has continued to do so. After 5 years of leaking, the contaminates reached all corners of the Pacific Ocean, from North America and Australia to Patagonia. Along the same coastline, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) found trace amounts of Fukushima contaminates 100 miles (150 km) off the coast of Eureka, California in November 2014. Despite the relatively dramatic increases in radiation, the contamination levels still satisfy the World Health Organization&#x27;s (WHO&#x27;s) standard for clean drinking water.

In 2019, the Japanese government announced that it was considering the possibility of dumping contaminated water from the Fukushima reactor into the Pacific Ocean. Japanese Environmental Minister Yoshiaki Harada reported that TEPCO had collected over a million tons of contaminated water, and by 2022 they would be out of space to safely store the radioactive water.

Multiple private agencies as well as various North American governments monitor the spread of radiation throughout the Pacific to track the potential hazards it can introduce to food systems, groundwater supplies, and ecosystems. In 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a report stating that radionuclides, traced from the Fukushima facility, were present in the United States food supply, but not to levels deemed to be a threat to public health – as well as any food and agricultural products imported from Japanese sources. It is commonly believed that, with the rate of the current radionuclide leakage, the dispersal into the water would prove beneficial, as most of the isotopes would be diluted by the water as well as become less radioactive over time, due to radioactive decay. Cesium (Cs-137) is the primary isotope released from the Fukushima Daiichi facility. Cs-137 has a long half-life, meaning it could potentially have long-term harmful effects, but as of now, its levels from 200 km outside of Fukushima show close to pre-accident levels, with little spread to North American coasts.

==== Chernobyl accident ====
Evidence can be seen from the 1986 Chernobyl event. Due to the violent nature of the accident there, a sizable portion of the resulting radioactive contamination of the atmosphere consisted of particles that were dispersed during the explosion. Many of these contaminates settled in groundwater systems in immediate surrounding areas, but also in Russia and Belarus. The ecological effects of the resulting radiation in groundwater can be seen in various aspects in the area affected by the sequence of environmental consequences. Radionuclides carried by groundwater systems have resulted in the uptake of radioactive material in plants and then up the food chains into animals, and eventually humans. One of the most important mechanisms of exposure to radiation was through agriculture contaminated by radioactive groundwater. Again, one of the greatest concerns for the population within the 30 km exclusion zone is the intake of Cs-137 by consuming agricultural products contaminated with groundwater. Thanks to the environmental and soil conditions outside the exclusion zone, the recorded levels are below those that require remediation, based on a survey in 1996. During this event, radioactive material was transported by groundwater across borders into neighboring countries. In Belarus, just north of Chernobyl, about 250,000 hectares of previously usable farmland were held by state officials until deemed safe.

Off-site radiological risk may be found in the form of flooding. Many citizens in the surrounding areas have been deemed at risk of exposure to radiation due to the Chernobyl reactor&#x27;s proximity to floodplains. A study was conducted in 1996 to see how far the radioactive effects were felt across eastern Europe. Lake Kojanovskoe in Russia, 250 km from the Chernobyl accident site, was found to be one of the most impacted lakes. Fish collected from the lake were found to be 60 times more radioactive than the European Union Standard. Further investigation found that the water source feeding the lake provided drinking water for about 9 million Ukrainians, as well as providing agricultural irrigation and food for 23 million more. The disaster has been described by lawyers, academics and journalists as an example of ecocide.

A cover was constructed around the damage reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. This helps in the remediation of radioactive material leaking from the site of the accident, but does little to protect the local area from radioactive isotopes that were dispersed in its soils and waterways more than 30 years ago. Partially due to the already abandoned urban areas, as well as international relations currently affecting the country, remediation efforts have minimized compared to the initial clean up actions and more recent accidents such as the Fukushima incident. On-site laboratories, monitoring wells, and meteorological stations can be found in a monitoring role at key locations affected by the accident.

=== Impact on people ===

In Kazakhstan, a Soviet Union nuclear testing site bore witness to the detonation of at least 450 atomic bombs. Notably, residents of Koyan showcased physical adaptation to the pervasive radiation, exhibiting resilience in their home environment, coupled with experiences of illness when outside it. Their acclimatization is discernible, evident in the mitigation of sickness upon returning to Koyan, challenging prevailing notions of victimhood associated with radioactive exposure. Despite relying on toxic food sources, the residents have adapted to their environment successfully. Koyan frequently faces the threat of fires, exemplified by a 2010 incident when Steppe grasses ignited, endangering the village. However, the government&#x27;s response could benefit from more consistent measures, such as mobilizing a fire brigade comprising local villagers to the Polygon for fire extinguishing.

Stawkowski&#x27;s primary assertion revolves around the concept of &quot;slow violence,&quot; portraying the subjects as resilient human beings who, despite the inevitability of illness in many families, have managed to lead long lives. While the historical context may lead Westerners to scrutinize political and scientific research during the Soviet Union era, the residents and neighboring villages represent a lasting legacy. This situation underscores the human capacity for survival and adaptation, emphasizing the need for accountability for past actions. The secrecy enveloping the Soviet nuclear project restricted researchers&#x27; access to data on released radioisotopes, unlike their United States counterparts, who could trace them in the environment. Soviet researchers faced limitations, compelled to trace even minor changes in body composition due to their prescribed obligations.

<text>Braniff Airways, Inc., operated as Braniff International Airways from 1948 until 1965, and then Braniff International from 1965 until air operations ceased, was an American airline that operated from 1928 until 1982 and continues today as a retailer, hotelier, travel service and branding and licensing company, administering the former airline&#x27;s employee pass program and other airline administrative duties. Braniff&#x27;s routes were primarily in the midwestern and southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, and South America. In the late 1970s it expanded to Asia and Europe. The airline ceased air carrier operations in May 1982 because of high fuel prices, credit card interest rates and extreme competition from the large trunk carriers and the new airline startups created by the Airline Deregulation Act of December 1978. Two later airlines used the Braniff name: the Hyatt Hotels-backed Braniff, Inc. in 1983–89, and Braniff International Airlines, Inc. in 1991–92.

In early 2015, the private Irrevocable Trust that owned and administered Braniff&#x27;s intellectual property and certain other company assets since 1983, released the assets to a private entity associated with the Trust, which founded a series of new Braniff companies that were incorporated in the State of Oklahoma, for historical purposes and for administration of the Braniff trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property. These companies included Braniff Air Lines, Inc., Paul R. Braniff, Inc., Braniff Airways, Inc., Braniff International Hotels, Inc., and Braniff International Corporation. During 2017 and 2018, some of the original Braniff companies were reinstated for historical purposes and administration of Braniff&#x27;s intellectual property assets including those of Mid-Continent Airlines, Pan American Grace Airways and Long and Harman Airlines, Inc. However, in early 2022, the private Trust that originally owned Braniff&#x27;s intellectual property since 1983, reacquired these assets along with the original Braniff companies and corresponding assets.

== The corporate evolution of Braniff International ==

In 1926, the first Braniff airline entity, Braniff Air Lines, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Oklahoma; in 1928, the company was reincorporated as Paul R. Braniff, Inc., again in the State of Oklahoma; in 1930, the company was reincorporated as Braniff Airways, Incorporated in the State of Oklahoma; in 1946, the company became publicly known under the trade name Braniff International Airways. In 1966, the company was reincorporated as Braniff Airways, Incorporated, in the State of Nevada; in 1973, the company was reincorporated as Braniff International Corporation and Braniff Airways, Incorporated, became the wholly owned subsidiary of Braniff International; in 1983, the company was reincorporated in Delaware as Dalfort Corporation, which included Braniff, Inc., as the wholly-owned airline subsidiary of Dalfort Corporation; in 1990, the company was reincorporated in Delaware as Braniff International Airlines, Inc.; and in 2015, the company was reincorporated as Braniff Airways, Incorporated, in the State of Oklahoma, which included its operating subsidiaries and original parent company.

==History==

===Braniff Air Lines, Inc.===

In April 1926, Paul Revere Braniff incorporated Braniff Air Lines, Inc., which was a planned flight school and aircraft maintenance entity that never came to fruition. However, the name and company were retained by him and his brother, Thomas Elmer Braniff, until 1932.

===Oklahoma Aero Club===

In 1927, Paul R. Braniff, his brother Thomas, and several investors formed Oklahoma Aero Club to fly the founding executives using a Stinson Detroiter, purchased by Paul Braniff, registered as NC1929, on hunting, fishing, and business trips. Paul Braniff was the sole pilot, and flew the investors to their meetings. These included Frank Phillips, founder of Phillips Petroleum; E. E. Westervelt, Manager of Southwest Bell Telephone; Fred Jones, Ford dealership owner; Virgil Browne of Coca-Cola Company; and Walter A. Lybrand, an Oklahoma City attorney.

Scheduling conflicts between the executives caused the new venture to be disbanded. Eventually, the Braniff brothers, Mr. Lybrand, and Mr. Westervelt bought out the interests of the other investors.

===Paul R. Braniff, Inc.===
In the spring of 1928, insurance magnate Thomas Elmer Braniff founded an air carrier, maintenance, aircraft dealer and flight school organization with his brother Paul, called Paul R. Braniff, Inc., which did business as Tulsa-Oklahoma City Airline. The new company, founded in May 1928, began regularly scheduled service from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, using 6-passenger Lockheed Vega single-engine aircraft on June 20, 1928.

The first flight was flown by Paul Braniff along with the company mechanic. The flight from Oklahoma City SW 29th Street Airport to Tulsa McIntire Airport was uneventful. However, the return flight was delayed several hours for thunderstorms in the area. The one-way fare between the two cities was $12.50 or $20.00 round trip with a baggage allowance of 25 pounds and a charge of 10 cents for each pound over the maximum allowable amount. The fare included ground transportation from both airports to the downtown areas of each city, which was provided by Yellow Cab Company. The new airline was solely dependent on passenger carrying fares for its revenue since it had not entered into any mail or express contracts with the United States Post Office.

===Universal Airlines and Braniff Air Lines, Inc.===

The new Braniff venture was profitable within a month of service inauguration but with the weakening economic conditions the company found itself in need of a merger partner. In 1929, the Braniff brothers sold the assets of the company (the Paul R. Braniff, Inc., company organization was retained by the Braniff brothers) to Universal Aviation Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri, at which time, the organization started operating as Braniff Air Lines, Inc. In 1930, the company was bought by the Aviation Corporation (AVCO) which was the predecessor of American Airlines.

Braniff Airlines, Inc., and the carrier grew by adding service from Oklahoma City to San Angelo, Texas, with intermediate stops at Wichita Falls, Breckenridge and Abilene, Texas, by the Summer of 1929 and service at Denison, Texas, was added on July 5, 1929. An additional route was operated between Oklahoma City and Ft Worth with intermediate stops at Wewoka, Oklahoma, and Dallas Love Field and a third route operated between Oklahoma City and Tulsa with intermediates stops at Wewoka and Seminole, Oklahoma, with all beginning on July 15, 1929 (this is most likely when the first Braniff service began at Dallas Love Field). The new airline performed as one of the best in the Universal System with a 99-percent completion rate reported during the month of July 1929 and the Airline also led the other divisions in number of passengers carried.

Service was added between Oklahoma City and Amarillo during the Summer of 1929. Package express and air freight service was added to the list of Braniff services on September 1, 1929, and included Dallas Love Field.

===Braniff Airways, Incorporated===
In the fall of 1930, Tom and Paul Braniff once again founded a new airline called Braniff Airways, Incorporated, which was organized on November 3, 1930, and began service on November 13, 1930, between Oklahoma City and Tulsa and Oklahoma City and Wichita Falls Texas. Braniff Airways purchased two six-passenger 450 horsepower Lockheed L-5 Vega single-engine aircraft capable of cruising at speeds of 150 miles-per-hour. Braniff&#x27;s advertising touted the new carrier as The World&#x27;s Fastest Airline.

Braniff quickly expanded its route system to include Kansas City Fairfax Airport on December 5, 1930. The new service operated nonstop between Kansas City and Tulsa and additional new cities were added in early 1931. By the end of 1930, the airline had added new service to its route map and employed six people and the new service between Tulsa and Kansas City had increased system route mileage to 241 miles. On February 25, 1931, Braniff welcomed in the new year by adding Chicago Midway Airport to its route map. The new service operated nonstop between Kansas City and the Windy City, once each day. The flight originated at Wichita Falls and continued to Midway Airport with intermediate stops at Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Kansas City. 
The summer of 1931 welcomed St Louis to the Braniff system on June 15, with nonstop service offered between St Louis and both Chicago and Tulsa. Additional Lockheed Vegas were added to the fleet during 1931 and 1932.

===Braniff&#x27;s First Airmail Route===

The fledgling airline shut down to reorganize in March 1933, with the company airborne again in less than a year. Paul Braniff, travelled to Washington, D.C., to petition for a Chicago-Dallas airmail route. The United States Postal Service granted Braniff their first airmail route soon after and the new route was inaugurated in May 1934, which effectively saved the company from failure. In early 1935, Braniff became the first airline to fly from Chicago to the U.S.–Mexico border. In August 1935, Paul Braniff left to pursue other opportunities and Charles Edmund Beard placed in charge of daily operations. In 1954, Beard was appointed president and CEO of Braniff with Fred Jones of Oklahoma City becoming chairman of the board.

===Midwestern expansion===

On December 28, 1934, Braniff purchased Dallas-based Long and Harman Air Lines, that operated passenger and mail routes from Amarillo to Brownsville and Galveston. Braniff Airways, merged with the company on December 28, 1934, and began operating Long and Harman&#x27;s routes on January 1, 1935, which took the airline from Chicago to Brownsville, Texas, and as far west as Amarillo, Texas.

===Wartime service===

During the war, Braniff remanded all of its Douglas DC-2 fleet and a substantial number of its new 21-passenger Douglas DC-3 fleet to the United States Army Air Forces. The DC-3 had just entered the fleet in December 1939. All of the Airline&#x27;s DC-2s were given to the military for wartime service and none were accepted back into the fleet at the end of the war. Besides offering its aircraft to the United States military, it also leased its facilities at Dallas Love Field to the military, which became a training site for pilots and mechanics.

Braniff was given a contract to operate a military cargo flight between Brownsville, Texas, and Panama City/Balboa City, in the Canal Zone. The route was called the Banana Run because Braniff&#x27;s pilots made agreements with the banana producers in Panama to move their bananas to the United States to sell. Because of the war, they could not fly their produce out of the country but Braniff devised at least a small way to assist the growers. Because of Braniff&#x27;s superb service during the war and over the Banana Run, the Airline would be rewarded with a significant international route award just a year after the war ended.

===Aerovias Braniff formed===

Thomas Elmer Braniff created a Mexican-based airline, Aerovias Braniff, in 1943. Service was inaugurated in March 1945, after the carrier received its operating permits from the Mexican government. Aerovias Braniff operated domestic flights in Mexico between Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey and Mexico City, and also between Mexico City, Puebla, Veracruz (city) and Merida, Mexico. The August 1946 Braniff Airways system timetable indicates that Braniff was operating scheduled passenger flights at this time on a roundtrip routing of Chicago - Kansas City - Dallas - San Antonio - Laredo - Nuevo Laredo which connected with the Aerovias Braniff service. The new company, owned by Mr. Braniff, operated three 21 passenger Douglas DC-3s that had been allocated to the carrier from the United States War Surplus Administration in February, 1945.

Mr. Braniff had applied to the federal Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) for authority to merge Aerovias Braniff with Braniff Airways, Inc. However, the Mexican government suspended Aerovias Braniff&#x27;s operating permits in October 1946, under pressure from Pan American Airways, Inc., and merger of the two carriers was not approved by the CAB. Braniff was allowed to operate a charter service in Mexico for a brief period in 1947 but that was also discontinued and service was not commenced again until 1960

===Latin America route award===

After World War II, on May 19, 1946, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) awarded Braniff routes to the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America, competing with Pan American-Grace Airways with this airline also being known as Panagra which Braniff would eventually acquire and merge with during the late 1960s. The Civil Aeronautics Board awarded Braniff a 7719 statute mile route from Dallas to Houston to Havana, Balboa, C.Z., Panama, Guayaquil, Lima, La Paz, Asuncion, and then to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and also a route from Asuncion to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At that time, the airline changed its trade name to Braniff International Airways (the official corporate name remained Braniff Airways, Incorporated) and flights to South America via Cuba and Panama began on June 4, 1948, with a routing of Chicago – Kansas City – Dallas – Houston – Havana – Balboa, C.Z. – Guayaquil – Lima (Lima service did not begin until June 18, 1948). The route was then extended in February 1949 to La Paz and in March 1949, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Douglas DC-4s and Douglas DC-6s flew to Rio; initially DC-3s flew Lima to La Paz. Braniff was the first airline authorized by the CAB to operate JATO or Jet Assisted Take-Off aircraft (DC-4) at La Paz.

Braniff inaugurated new service from Lima, Peru, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a stop at São Paulo, added in October 1950. Service was extended in March 1950 from La Paz to Asuncion, Paraguay, and in May 1950 to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Argentine President Juan Perón and his famed wife Evita Perón participated in the festivities at the Palacio Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires. In October 1951 departures from Dallas became daily: three a week to Buenos Aires and four to Rio de Janeiro. Beginning in 1951, flights to South America stopped at Miami, but Braniff did not carry domestic passengers between Dallas and Houston and Miami.

===Mid-Continent Airlines merger===

By October 1951, Braniff flew to 29 airports in the US, from Chicago and Denver south to Brownsville, Texas, to Central America, Cuba and South America.

After months of negotiations Braniff acquired Mid-Continent Airlines, a small Kansas City-based trunk line, on August 16, 1952. The merger added numerous cities, including Minneapolis/St. Paul, Sioux City, and Sioux Falls in the North; Des Moines, Omaha, and St. Louis in the Midwest; and Tulsa, Shreveport, and New Orleans in the South. The acquisition of the Minneapolis/St. Paul to Kansas City route (with stops in Des Moines and Rochester, Minnesota) was of particular interest to Braniff, as Mid-Continent had been awarded this route instead of Braniff in 1939.

After the merger Braniff operated 75 aircraft and over 4000 employees, including 400 pilots. In 1955 Braniff was the tenth largest US airline by passenger-miles and ninth largest by domestic passenger miles.

With the addition of the South America route system, merger with Mid-Continent Airlines, and reduction in mail subsidy on the Mid-Continent system, Braniff International Airways recorded a US$1.8 million operating loss during 1953. Aircraft that were scheduled to be disposed of offset the loss and the company recorded a meager US$11,000 net income. An increase in mail subsidy, requested by Mr. Braniff before his death, was granted in 1954, and the company returned to profitability.

===Deaths of the Braniff brothers===

On January 10, 1954, Braniff&#x27;s founder Thomas Elmer Braniff died when a Grumman flying boat owned by United Gas crash-landed on the shore of Wallace Lake, 15 miles outside of Shreveport, Louisiana, due to icing. According to information from Captain George A. Stevens: &quot;Mr Braniff was on a hunting expedition with a group of important citizens of Louisiana. They were returning to Shreveport from a small duck hunting lake near Lake Charles, Louisiana, in a Grumman Mallard aircraft with no deicing system. The wings iced up on approach to landing in Shreveport, and the plane lost altitude. One of the wings hit cypress stumps and the plane crashed against the shore. It caught fire and all 12 lives aboard were lost.&quot;

Braniff Executive Vice President Charles Edmund Beard became the first non-Braniff family member to assume the role of president of the airline after Tom Braniff&#x27;s death. Mr. Beard gathered Braniff employees together at the Braniff hangar at Dallas Love Field on January 18, 1954, to announce that the airline would move forward and assured the public that the airline would continue. In February 1954, Mrs. Bess Thurman Braniff was appointed a vice president of the company. She was instrumental in calming the fears of Braniff&#x27;s creditors, which became concerned especially after the losses incurred in 1953, quickly followed by the loss of Mr. Braniff.

Paul R. Braniff died in June 1954 from complications from pneumonia and from throat cancer. Tom Braniff&#x27;s wife, Bess Thurman Braniff, also died in August 1954, of cancer. Tom&#x27;s son, Thurman Braniff, was killed in a training plane crash at Oklahoma City in 1937, and his daughter Jeanne Braniff Terrell died in 1948 from complications of childbirth. Jeanne Braniff&#x27;s child died two days after birth and her husband Alexander Terrell died a year later in 1949.

===New equipment and facilities===

Charles Edmund Beard led Braniff into the jet age. The first jets were four Boeing 707-227s; a fifth crashed on a test flight when still owned by Boeing. Braniff was the only airline to order the 707-227 because their low density and powerful engines were perfectly suited to Braniff&#x27;s thin and high routes from the US Mainland to South America. In 1971, Braniff sold the jets to British West Indies Airways (BWIA), an airline based in the Caribbean. Boeing 720s were added in the early 1960s. In 1965 Braniff&#x27;s fleet was about half jet, comprising 707s, 720s and British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jetliners. The long range Boeing 707-320C intercontinental model was then introduced. However, the 707, 720 and One-Eleven would all subsequently be removed from the fleet in favor of the ideally suited Boeing 727 Trijet. Braniff&#x27;s last piston schedule was operated with a Convair 340 aircraft in September 1967 and the last Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop service was flown in April 1969.

In February 1957, Braniff moved into a new headquarters located temporarily in the new Exchange Bank Building at Exchange Park, a high-rise office development within sight of Dallas Love Field. The airline was required to move into the temporary building until its new 10-story Braniff Tower also in Exchange Park was ready for move in on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1958. Braniff remained in this building until December 1978, when it moved into
its spacious new Braniff Place World Headquarters on the west side of DFW Airport. The airline opened a Maintenance and Operations Base with over 433,000 square feet on the east side of Dallas Love Field at 7701 Lemmon Avenue in October 1958. The airline would occupy the facility until the late 1980s, with the Braniff, Inc. (Braniff II) holding company, Dalfort, remaining there until 2001.

===Boeing Super Sonic Transport (SST)===

In April 1964, Braniff made deposits on two Boeing 2707 Supersonic Transports, $100,000 per aircraft. This would give Braniff slots number 38 and 44 when the SST began production. President Beard said the two aircraft would be used on the carrier&#x27;s US to Latin America flights, where the Boeing 707 was performing satisfactorily.

When this deposit was made, the SST program was being financed by the US government. In 1971, Congress cancelled the program, against the Nixon Administration&#x27;s wishes.

===Greatamerica===

In 1964, Troy Post, chairman of Greatamerica Corporation, an insurance holding company based in Dallas, purchased Braniff and National Car Rental as part of an expansion of holdings and growth outside the insurance business. Braniff and National were chosen after Greatamerica CFO Charles Edward Acker identified them as under-utilized and under-managed companies. Acker had stated in a 1964 study that Braniff&#x27;s conservative management was hampering the growth that the &quot;jet age&quot; required, in part by cash purchase of new planes instead of financing them, diverting working capital from growth initiatives. As part of the acquisition, Acker became executive vice president and CFO of Braniff.

Troy Post hired Harding Lawrence, executive vice president of Continental Airlines, who was responsible for a 500 percent increase in sales at the Los Angeles-based carrier during his tenure, as the new president of Braniff International. Lawrence was determined to give Braniff a glossy, modern, and attention-getting image. Over the next 15 years, his expansion into new markets – combined with ideas unorthodox for the airline industry – led Braniff to record financial and operating performance, expanding its earnings tenfold despite typical passenger load factors around 50 percent.

===Mary Wells and &quot;The End of the Plain Plane&quot;===

To begin the overhaul of Braniff&#x27;s image, Lawrence hired Jack Tinker and Partners, who assigned advertising executive Mary Wells – later Mary Wells Lawrence after her November 1967 marriage to Harding Lawrence in Paris – as account leader. First on the agenda was to overhaul Braniff&#x27;s public image — including the 1959 Red and Blue El Dorado Super Jet livery which Wells saw as &quot;staid&quot;. New Mexico architect Alexander Girard, Italian fashion designer Emilio Pucci, and shoe designer Beth Levine were hired, and with this new talent Braniff began the &quot;End of the Plain Plane&quot; campaign.

At Girard&#x27;s recommendation the old livery was dropped in favor of a single color on each plane, selected from a palette of rich and iridescent hues like &quot;Chocolate Brown&quot; and &quot;Metallic Purple.&quot; He favored a small &quot;BI&quot; logo and small titles. Braniff engineering and Braniff&#x27;s advertising department modified Girard&#x27;s colors, enlarged the &quot;BI&quot; logo, and added white wings and tails. This, ironically, was based on the 1930s Braniff Lockheed Vega color schemes, which also carried colorful paint with white wings and tails. The new fleet carried such colors as beige, ochre, orange, turquoise, baby blue, medium blue, lemon yellow, and lavender/periwinkle blue. Lavender was dropped after a month, due to the similarity in coloration to the Witch Moth (Ascalapha odorata), a sign of bad luck in Mexican mythology.

Fifteen colors were used during the 1960s (Harper &amp; George modified Girard&#x27;s original seven colors in 1967), in combination with 57 variations of Herman Miller fabrics. Many of the color schemes were applied to aircraft interiors, gate lounges, ticket offices, and even the corporate headquarters. Art to complement the color schemes was flown in from Mexico, Latin America, and South America. Girard designed an extensive line of furniture for Braniff&#x27;s ticket offices and customer lounges. This furniture was made available to the public by Herman Miller, for a year in 1967.

Pucci used a series of nautical themes for crew uniforms for flight attendants, pilots, ground and terminal personnel. For the hostesses, Pucci used &quot;space age&quot; themes, including plastic Bolas (first edition zippered version) Space Helmets (second edition with snaps) as they were dubbed by Pucci. These clear plastic bubbles, which resembled Captain Video helmets and which Braniff termed &quot;RainDome&quot;, were to be worn between the terminal and the plane to prevent bouffant hairstyles from being disturbed by outside elements. &quot;RainDomes&quot; were dropped the following year because the helmets cracked easily, there was no place to store them on the aircraft, and new jetway installation at many airports made them unnecessary. However, the helmets were still approved for use through 1967. For the footwear, Beth Levine created plastic boots and designed two-tone calfskin boots and shoes. Later uniforms and accessories were composed of interchangeable parts, which could be removed and added as needed.

Emilio Pucci designed additional new uniforms for Braniff through 1975. This included the updated 1966 Supersonic Derby Collection; 1968 Pucci Classic Collection; 1971 747 Braniff Place Pant Dress Collection; 1972 727 Braniff Place Pant Dress Collection; 1973 Pucci Blue Pilot Uniform; 1974 Pucci The Classic Collection and finally in 1975 the Flying Colors Collection, which only included impressive white coveralls with red and blue Flying Colors logo for maintenance personnel.

===MAC Charters===

In 1966, Braniff obtained a government contract to transport military personnel from the US Mainland to Vietnam and other military outposts in the Pacific region. Braniff also operated flights to and from Hawaii for R&amp;R furloughs for military personnel during the Vietnam War. The Military Airlift Command routes were expanded in the Pacific and added to the Atlantic side in 1966. The last Braniff MAC charter associated with the Vietnam War was flown in 1975.

===Merger with Panagra===

In February 1967 Braniff, purchased Pan American-Grace Airways which was also known as Panagra from shareholders of Pan American World Airways and W. R. Grace, increasing its presence making it the leading US airline in South America. The merger was effective on February 1, 1967, and Panagra&#x27;s remaining piston airliners were retired. Panagra operated early model Douglas DC-8 jets at this time, which were a new addition to the Braniff fleet; a Panagra order for five long-range Douglas DC-8-62 jetliners was then taken up by Braniff, and deliveries began in late 1967, replacing the older Series 30 Panagra DC-8s by the end of 1967.

===&quot;When You Got It — Flaunt It&quot;===

Under the leadership of George Lois and his advertising firm Lois, Holland Calloway, Braniff started a campaign that presented stars such as Andy Warhol, Sonny Liston, Salvador Dalí, Whitey Ford, the Playboy Bunny, and other celebrities of the time flying Braniff. After the End of the Plain Plane Campaign, it became one of the most celebrated marketing efforts Madison Avenue had ever produced, blending style and arrogance. The key advertising slogan was &quot;When you got it — flaunt it.&quot;

Management considered the campaign a success. Braniff reported an 80 percent increase in business during the life of the campaign in spite of an economic downturn the following year.

===&quot;Terminal of the Future&quot; and JetRail===

Braniff opened the &quot;Terminal of the Future&quot; at Dallas Love Field in late December 1968 and the Jetrail Car Park people mover monorail system in April 1970. Both operated until January 1974. Jetrail was the world&#x27;s first fully automated monorail system, taking passengers from remote parking lots at Love Field to the Braniff terminal. Braniff was a leading partner in the planning of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and contributed many innovations to the airline industry during this time.

===Remaking the jet fleet===

Braniff had been one of the first U.S. operators of the BAC One-Eleven (and the first U.S. airline to order the twin jet), but in 1965 Lawrence ordered twelve new Boeing 727-100s and cancelled most of the remaining One-Eleven orders. The 727s had been selected before Lawrence&#x27;s arrival, but no orders had been placed. These planes were the &quot;quick change&quot; (B727-100C) model, with a large freight loading door on the left side just aft of the flight deck. This allowed Braniff to begin late-night cargo service, while the aircraft carried passengers during the day, in August 1966. This doubled the 727 utilization rate and allowed Braniff to open the new cargo business, dubbed AirGo. The new 727s could also be outfitted in a mixed cargo/passenger combi aircraft configuration and Braniff did operate &quot;red eye&quot; overnight services carrying cargo in the forward section with seating for 51 passengers in the rear coach compartment.
In 1970 Braniff accepted delivery of the 100th Boeing 747 built – a 747-127, N601BN – and began flights from Dallas to Honolulu, Hawaii, on January 15, 1971. This plane, dubbed &quot;747 Braniff Place&quot; and &quot;The Most Exclusive Address In The Sky&quot;, was Braniff&#x27;s flagship, and it flew an unprecedented 15 hours per day with a 99 percent dispatch reliability rate over the Transpacific long route. In 1978 N601BN flew the first flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to London.

The Braniff 747 livery of bright orange led to the aircraft being nicknamed &quot;The Great Pumpkin&quot;. The popularity of &quot;The Great Pumpkin&quot; led to extensive publicity, and even the licensing of a scale model by the Airfix model company.

The Boeing 727 became the backbone of the Braniff fleet. The trijet was the key aircraft in the 1971 Fleet Standardization Plan that called for three aircraft types: the Boeing 727 primarily operated on domestic services, the Boeing 747 for Hawaii, and the Douglas DC-8 for South America. This plan would lower operating costs. When Lawrence took office in May 1965, Braniff operated 13 different aircraft types. Braniff eventually ordered several variants of the 727 including the &quot;quick change&quot; cargo/passenger combi aircraft variant, the stretched 727-200, and later the 727-200 Advanced. Lawrence also increased utilization of the fleet.

In 1969 the Lockheed L-188 Electras were retired, making Braniff an all pure jet airline. By the mid-1970s Braniff&#x27;s fleet of 727s showed the efficiencies that a single type of aircraft could produce. The company&#x27;s maintenance costs on the 727s were lower than the dual pilot DC-9. In 1975 Braniff had one 747, 11 DC-8s, and 70 727s. The Douglas DC-8s were aging, and there was speculation whether new Boeing 757s, Boeing 767s or Airbus A300s would replace the long range DC-8-62s (which flew Braniff&#x27;s South American routes including nonstops from Los Angeles and New York City to Bogota, Colombia and Lima, Peru as well as nonstops from Miami and New York City to Buenos Aires) with McDonnell Douglas MD-80s possibly being introduced on shorter routes. In 1978 Braniff announced it had chosen the Boeing 757 and 767 to replace the DC-8s over its Latin America Division routes, but the airline never operated the 757, 767, A300 or MD-80.

===Alexander Calder===
In December 1972, American Modern Master Alexander Calder was commissioned by Braniff to paint an aircraft. Calder was introduced to Harding Lawrence by veteran advertising executive George Stanley Gordon, who would eventually take over Braniff&#x27;s advertising account. Calder&#x27;s contribution was a Douglas DC-8 known simply as &quot;Flying Colors of South America.&quot; In 1975 it was showcased at the Paris Air Show in Paris, France. Its designs reflected the bright colors and simple designs of South America and Latin America, and was used mainly on South American flights.

Later in 1975, he debuted &quot;Flying Colors of the United States&quot; to commemorate the Bicentennial of the United States. This time, the aircraft was a Boeing 727-200. First Lady Betty Ford dedicated &quot;Flying Colors of the United States&quot; in Washington, D.C., on November 17, 1975. Calder died in November 1976 as he was finalizing a third livery, termed &quot;Flying Colors of Mexico&quot; or &quot;Salute To Mexico&quot;. Consequently, this livery was not used on any Braniff aircraft.

===Halston and the Elegance Campaign===

In the fall of 1976, Braniff commissioned American couturier Halston to bring an elegant and sophisticated feel to Braniff. The new Ultrasuede uniforms and Ultra Space leather aircraft interiors were dubbed the Ultra Look by Halston, who had used the term to describe his elegant fashions. The Ultra Look was applied to all uniforms and the entire Braniff fleet (including the two Calder aircraft). The Ultra Look was an integral part of Braniff&#x27;s new Elegance Campaign, which was designed to herald the maturing of Braniff, as well as the look and feel of opulence throughout the airline&#x27;s operation. Halston&#x27;s uniforms and simple designs were praised by critics and passengers. A sleek new paint scheme, dubbed Ultra, was designed by Braniff&#x27;s industrial design firm, Harper and George along with Detroit auto company Cars and Concepts in conjunction with Halston. Iridescent colors of Chocolate Brown, Perseus Green, Mercury Blue and Terra Cotta along with two metallic colors were matched with striking racing stripes called Power Paint Stripes, which served to enhance the elegant scheme with a sleek racy feel.

===Concorde SST===

In 1978, Braniff Chairman Harding L. Lawrence negotiated a unique interchange agreement to operate the Concorde over American soil, making it first time that Concorde was used for domestic—and fully overland—flights. Concorde service began on 12 January 1979 between Dallas–Fort Worth and Washington, D.C., with service to Paris and London on interchange flights with Air France and British Airways respectively.

Domestic flights between Dallas-Fort Worth and Washington Dulles airports were operated by Braniff with its own cockpit and cabin crews. During the domestic flights, the Braniff&#x27;s registration numbers were affixed to the fuselage with temporary adhesive vinyl stickers. At Washington Dulles, the cockpit and cabin crews were replaced by ones from Air France and British Airways for the continued flight to Europe, and the temporary Braniff registration stickers were removed. This process was reversed after alighting in Washington Dulles from Europe for the domestic flights to Dallas-Fort Worth. Due to the American noise regulations, Concorde was limited to Mach 0.95 yet flew at slightly above Mach 1.

Concorde service proved a loss leader but it provided marketing and promotion that created continued brand awareness around the globe for Braniff. Braniff charged only a 10-percent premium over standard first-class fare to fly the Concorde and later removed the surcharge. The domestic flights often had no more than 15 passengers on average for each flight while Braniff&#x27;s Boeing 727 flights were filled close to the capacity despite being 20 minutes slower than Concorde. Braniff ended Concorde flights on June 1, 1980.

However, in spite of the service&#x27;s less than stellar performance, the cost to Braniff was negligible thanks mainly to the agreements that Braniff negotiated with both British Airways and Air France. Braniff was fully reimbursed for any losses incurred as a result of the interchange agreement. All three carriers entered into the agreement for the purpose of promotion of Concorde in the United States and around the world. This key premise was highly successful. British Airways became concerned at the unprofitable stance that Concorde had taken and as a result of the Braniff interchange critical studies were begun to determine how to make Concorde profitable. The results of these studies found that Concorde must be marketed as an ultra luxury travel experience. Implementation of this program turned the Concorde program into a profitable as well as prestigious venture.

Braniff issued select promotional materials and postcards that presented a Concorde with orange cheat line that began at the tip of nose and continued to the end of tail, white BI logo (designed by Alexander Girard as part of &quot;End of the Plain Plane&quot; campaign in 1965) against orange vertical stabilizer, and 1978 Braniff Ultra Font for &quot;Braniff&quot; below the cheat line. The font was part of Braniff&#x27;s updated 1978 Ultra livery that removed &quot;INTERNATIONAL&quot; from the name only on Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-8-62 aircraft. Braniff&#x27;s Boeing 747 aircraft continued to carry the &quot;Braniff International&quot; titles in the 1969 Harper and George International Font. However, unlike Singapore Airline&#x27;s Concorde, none of the Braniff Interchange Concordes were impressed with Braniff livery.


===Deregulation and global expansion===

Until 1980, Braniff was one of the fastest-growing and most-profitable airlines in the United States. However, deregulation of the airline industry was introduced in October 1978, and Braniff – as well as many of the United States&#x27; major air carriers, especially the smaller National carrier such as Braniff – were caught in a peculiar predicament as a result of the unprecedented change in how airline business was conducted.

Lawrence accurately believed that the answer to deregulation was to expand Braniff&#x27;s route system dramatically or face an immediate erosion of Braniff&#x27;s highly profitable routes as a result of unbridled competition from especially the large trunk carriers along with the new low-cost startup carriers. Braniff was surrounded on all sides at Dallas/Ft. Worth, Kansas City, Chicago, Denver, Atlanta and Miami, by the larger carriers, which were poised to immediately begin invading Braniff&#x27;s long held territory. These large carriers had in abundance what Braniff termed &quot;City Power&quot; which was the ability to use its massive assets to dominate a particular destination. Braniff therefore in response enlarged the domestic network by 50% on December 15, 1978, adding 16 new cities and 32 new routes, which Braniff stated was the &quot;largest single-day increase by any airline in history&quot;. The expansion was successful operationally and financially. Although the expansion of 1978 was successful (by late 1979, Braniff&#x27;s market share moved significantly for the first time since the 1940s from an average of 4.5 percent to an unprecedented 6.5 percent market share all directly related to the expansion program) it did not stop losses from beginning in late 1979 as a result of unprecedented rises in fuel costs and credit card interest rates of 20 percent and higher, coupled with general economic unrest and an unprecedented drop in load factor of 5 points in the Fourth Quarter due do the significant use of American Airlines and United Airlines discount fare coupons during the holiday travel season. As a result, Braniff reported its first operating loss since the recession of 1970. The operating loss was $39 million in 1979, then $120M in 1980 and $107M in 1981. The losses in 1980 were directly attributed to Braniff&#x27;s slip in market share due to the erosion of its bread and butter routes and corresponding feed to the larger carriers such as American Airlines, Delta Airlines and United Airlines.

In 1979, international hubs were created in Boston and Los Angeles to handle expected increases in travel outside North America while international service was increased from Dallas/Fort Worth. From Boston and Dallas/Fort Worth, new transatlantic Boeing 747 service to Europe was operated to Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt and Paris. From Los Angeles, new nonstop transpacific Boeing 747 service was flown to Guam and Seoul with direct, no change of plane 747 flights being operated to Hong Kong and Singapore. Load factors on these routes were considerable but with the at times unfair competition Braniff faced from Asian carriers, it pushed Braniff&#x27;s breakeven point even higher making the routes unsuccessful once coupled with exorbitant fuel costs across the globe and the loss of significant feed from its domestic system due to severe competition from the new startup carriers and the larger mega airlines. This international expansion was also planned to have included flights to Tokyo, as well as an &quot;oil run&quot; between Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Bahrain; however, these routes never commenced although service to Bahrain was approved by the US Government in 1979. Besides standard model 747s, long range 747SPs were acquired as well for these new international flights with the 747 also being operated to South America. Also in 1979, Braniff began operating nonstop flights between Honolulu and Guam and Los Angeles as well as one stop service between Honolulu and Hong Kong via Guam in addition to its long running nonstop service between Honolulu and Dallas/Fort Worth.

The main impediment to success after Braniff&#x27;s expansion was fuel cost, which increased 94 percent during 1979, coupled with strong competition from larger carriers in both the Domestic and Asia/Pacific Systems. For the first time in airline history, fuel costs, which doubled in 1979, exceeded labor as the largest operating cost for airlines. Braniff&#x27;s fuel bill increased from $200 million in 1978 to more than $400 million in 1979, with 25 percent of this increase a result of increased flying but 75 percent was solely due to the rise in fuel costs around the globe.

The expense of the new equipment and the costs associated with the new service and hubs increased Braniff&#x27;s debt substantially although it was still manageable. However, the driving force behind Braniff&#x27;s problems were the unprecedented rise in fuel costs, which topped 104-percent increase during 1980 and the erosion the company experienced as large carriers such as United, Delta and American along with new low-cost startups began taking Braniffs key routes that were protected prior to deregulation. This was the fear that Braniff and other small trunk carriers, such as National Airlines, Western Airlines and Continental Airlines had expressed concern about prior to deregulation. It was now coming true for all of these smaller carriers. As an example, Braniff&#x27;s revenue for 1979 was three times less than American&#x27;s, which had moved its headquarters to Braniff&#x27;s hometown, DFW Airport in 1979.

For the first time in history beginning in 1979, the cost of fuel exceeded the cost of labor, which had been the airline industry&#x27;s largest expense. Braniff&#x27;s fuel costs rose from nearly US$200 million to US$400 million during 1979 and in spite of this huge increase in costs, the company still managed to implement service to multiple domestic destinations and expand across the Atlantic and Pacific and endure the airline coupon sales gimmicks used by passengers during the fourth quarter of 1979, which caused Braniff to lose 5 percentage points of load factor during the fourth quarter, and still only report a moderate loss of US$39 million. Had Braniff&#x27;s fuel increased in 1977 by 94-percent the company would have reported a loss of nearly US$100 million, which would have been catastrophic for any airline.

In late 1978 Braniff moved to a sprawling new headquarters, Braniff Place, just inside the western grounds of the airport. The beautiful employee playground/administration/training facility was the first of its kind and was later used as the model for Google and Apple headquarters design. Braniff&#x27;s decreasing load factors combined with record-breaking fuel cost escalations, unfair and unbridled competition, unprecedented interest rates, and a national recession (the worst since the Great Depression of 1929), produced massive financial shortfalls especially in 1980, which was caused by the severe recession that was affecting travel globally.

Harding Lawrence elected to retire in December 1980, effective January 7, 1981, after nearly 16 years (1965-1981) of service to the company. Dubbed, the last airline maverick, Lawrence oversaw the carrier&#x27;s rise from a $100 million a year in revenue company to more than $1.4 billion a year in revenue at his retirement.

By 1981, all 747 service to Asia and Europe with the exception of nonstop flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and London had been discontinued although Braniff continued to operate 747s on international service to Bogota, Buenos Aires and Santiago in South America as well as on domestic flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Honolulu.

===John J. Casey becomes president===

On January 7, 1981, the board of directors elected John J. Casey as president, chief executive officer and chairman of Braniff Airways, Inc. and Braniff International Corporation as a replacement to the outgoing and retiring Harding Lawrence. Former Braniff president Russel Thayer was elected as vice chairman of the board, William Huskins as executive vice president, Neal J. Robinson as executive vice president of marketing, and Edson &quot;Ted&quot; Beckwith as executive vice president of finance. Mr. Thayer had been extremely vocal about Braniff&#x27;s critical position if deregulation were to take effect.

John Casey expanded Braniff&#x27;s capacity during the summer of 1981 and traffic increased with a promise of the beginnings of a turnaround. However, an unforeseen strike by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) caused delays and a decrease in traffic that actually enabled the carrier to regroup during the decrease in service. Casey then implemented the Braniff Strikes Back Campaign in the fall of 1981, streamlining the carrier&#x27;s air fare structure into a simplified two-tier fare system. As part of this campaign, some Boeing 727s were divided into Braniff Premier Service (traditional First Class service) and Coach Class. The remainder of the 727s were all-Coach Class with reduced fares. The campaign was not successful, pushing Braniff&#x27;s bread-and-butter business travelers over to traditional airlines with First Class on all flights. Braniff had two options prior to deregulation: grow into a larger carrier to possess &quot;city power&quot; at its key hubs or become a low cost carrier. Although, Braniff was considered a low-cost carrier it still possessed a seasoned and unionized work force with medical and pension plans, which were the same overhead costs as the larger trunk carriers. This was the same for Western, National and Continental Airlines.

===Howard Putnam becomes president===

In fall 1981, Braniff Chairman John Casey was told by the Braniff board that a new president needed to be found to try to curb Braniff&#x27;s mounting losses. Casey met with Southwest Airlines President Howard A. Putnam and offered him the Braniff executive position. Putnam accepted the offer, but he required that his own financial manager from Southwest Airlines, Philip Guthrie, be allowed to follow him to Braniff.

Howard Putnam implemented a one-fare-structure plan called the Texas Class Campaign. Texas Class created a one-fare, one-service airline domestically and removed First Class from all Braniff aircraft. Only flights to South America, London and Hawaii offered full First Class services. In the program&#x27;s first month in operation, December 1981, Braniff&#x27;s revenues dropped from slightly over US$100 million per month to US$80 million. Braniff no longer had the revenue structure to maintain its cash requirements. In January 1982, Braniff recorded its first negative cash flow. Competition throughout the Braniff system, and increased service at Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport by American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, both of which operated hubs at DFW, caused further erosion in revenue.

===Eastern buys South America routes===

In early 1982, Braniff Chairman Howard Putnam decided to sell the Latin American Division. Negotiations had been underway with Pan American World Airways since early 1982, but the Civil Aeronautics Board would not approve sale to Pan Am because it felt that Pan Am would have a monopoly over other American carriers in the region. Pan American responded by offering to jointly lease the routes with Air Florida for three years at a price of US$30 million. Pan American Chairman, and former Braniff International President, Ed Acker had previously served as Chairman of Air Florida before taking the leadership position at Pan American. The CAB decided that it would not change its position in spite of the joint service application.

Braniff International maintained that it was hemorrhaging cash and that it could not continue to operate the money losing South American system. The normally profitable South America system began losing money when fuel prices expanded in 1979 combined with a significant loss of critical feed at Braniff&#x27;s US gateway cities, which made the legendary Douglas DC-8-62 four-engine long-range jets uneconomical. Braniff entered into negotiations with Eastern Airlines to lease the routes to the Miami-based carrier for US$18 million effective June 1, 1982, for one year. On April 26, 1982, the Civil Aeronautics Board approved the Eastern/Braniff lease agreement in a 5–0 unanimous decision. Eastern Chairman Frank Borman reported that Eastern had paid Braniff an initial payment of US$11 million with the remaining seven million USD to be paid at the end of 1982. Eastern initially offered to lease the routes for US$30 million for six years but the CAB denied the request stating that it was too long. Eastern had been trying unsuccessfully to obtain authority to fly to South America since 1938, and would operate 24 weekly flights from Miami, two from New York, and one from New Orleans to west coast South American cities that Braniff mainly served.

Under the agreement Braniff International would retain service to Venezuela and American Airlines would serve Braniff&#x27;s Brazilian services as required by a bilateral treaty between the United States and Brazil. Approval from South American governments for Eastern&#x27;s one-year lease of Braniff&#x27;s routes would not be required according to United States officials. Braniff International lauded the CAB&#x27;s quick decision as the carrier had stated that because of its tenuous cash position that it might have to shut the routes down if an agreement was not approved. Braniff ceased operations on May 12–13, 1982, and Eastern took over the routes earlier than the planned June 1, 1982, commencement of service date.

Eastern Air Lines had reported losses for 1981 and felt that the purchase of Braniff&#x27;s South America routes would help, but Eastern&#x27;s financial condition worsened through the 1980s. Eastern never made a profit with their South American routes, due to the region&#x27;s delicate financial situation at the time. On April 26, 1990, the United States Department of Transportation approved the sale of Eastern Airlines&#x27; Latin American routes to American Airlines for US$349 million. Eastern had recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and planned to use the money from the route sale to repay creditors and regain its financial footing. The funds were placed into a special fund controlled by Eastern&#x27;s creditors who had recently ousted controversial Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who had taken over the 60-year-old aviation legend in 1986.

===Cessation of air carrier operations in 1982===

On May 11, 1982, Howard Putnam left a courtroom at the Federal Courthouse in Brooklyn, New York City after failing to gain a court injunction to stop a threatened pilot strike (Braniff&#x27;s pilot union maintains that they were not threatening a strike at this time). However, Putnam was successful in obtaining an extension of time from Braniff&#x27;s principal creditors until October 1982. The next day, on May 12, Braniff Airways ceased air operations, ending 54 years of air service. Braniff flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport that morning were suddenly grounded, and passengers were forced to disembark, being told that Braniff was no longer flying. A thunderstorm provided an excuse to cancel many afternoon flights that day, although Braniff&#x27;s legendary Boeing 747 Flight 501 to Honolulu departed as scheduled, with the crew later refusing to divert the flight to Los Angeles International Airport. The flight returned to DFW the following morning, the last scheduled Braniff flight.

In the following days Braniff jets at Dallas-Fort Worth sat idle on the apron by Terminal 2W. The Douglas DC-8-62 fleet was flown from Miami to Dallas Love Field and stored until new owners could be found.

However, even though all of Braniff&#x27;s scheduled and non-scheduled airline operations ceased, all of the company&#x27;s subsidiaries continued in operation, some for many years. Braniff&#x27;s maintenance activities at Dallas Love Field continued to serve its non-Braniff customers and oversaw the maintenance of Braniff&#x27;s grounded fleet at DFW Airport and Love Field. Braniff also continued to operate its Council Rooms, which were VIP passenger lounges, at certain airports including DFW Airport, which were contracted for use by other airlines that operated in Braniff&#x27;s terminal facilities. Braniff Realty, Inc., continued to operate the Airline&#x27;s airport facilities including Braniff&#x27;s Terminal of the Future at Love Field, until it was sold to American Airlines in 1996. Braniff Realty also owned several of Braniff&#x27;s Boeing 727-200 Trijet airliners, which were later sold as a result of the reorganization of the company in 1983.

Braniff Educations Systems, Inc., met for classes as scheduled on the morning of May 13, 1982, and during the reorganization was sold to Frontier Airlines, Inc., and operated as Braniff Education Systems, Inc., d/b/a as Frontier Services, Inc. In 1985, the company was sold to a private individual in Texas, who operated the entity as Braniff Education Systems, Inc., d/b/a as IATA or International Aviation and Travel Academy, which provided initial pilot training, airline simulator training, maintenance technician training and airline ticket and travel agent training. IATA survived until 2007.

Braniff International Hotels, Inc., also continued in operation, which primarily operated the world famous Driskill Hotel in Austin, Texas. At one time, Braniff Hotels operated properties throughout the United States and Latin America. Braniff had saved the historic Driskill from demolition in 1973 and purchased the entity outright in February 1975. The assets of Braniff Hotels were transferred to the new Dalfort Corporation, which was the reorganized company created from Braniff Airways, Incorporated, and Braniff International Corporation, which was financed by the Hyatt Corporation. Eventually, the Driskill was sold to the Lincoln Hotel Corporation in 1985.

With an approved bankruptcy reorganization agreement with Hyatt Corporation a new Braniff, Inc., would be created from the assets of Braniff Airways, Inc. and Braniff International Corporation and would begin operations on March 1, 1984. Howard Putnam stepped down as president of the company with the announcement of the agreement and longtime Braniff International Senior Vice President of Flight Operations Dale R. States, became president of the company until the reorganization into Dalfort Corporation was completed on December 15, 1983.

The original airline company continues today as a retail, licensing and branding and hotelier firm. Braniff is one of only two heritage airlines that continues to control its own intellectual property and other assets with Pan Am being the other. Braniff Place World Headquarters, which the carrier occupied until December 15, 1983, on the west side of DFW Airport eventually became GTE Place, and then Verizon Place.

===Successor organizations===

Former Braniff employees founded Minnesota-based Sun Country Airlines in 1983. It operated a fleet of Boeing 727-200s and McDonnell Douglas DC-10s until 2001 when it filed for bankruptcy. Sun Country then reorganized and currently flies a modern fleet of Boeing 737-800s.

Fort Worth Airlines was founded in 1984 by Thomas B. King, a former Braniff vice president; two-thirds of the airline&#x27;s executives came from Braniff, and even its office furniture was Braniff surplus bought at the airline&#x27;s bankruptcy liquidation sale. Fort Worth Airlines used 56-seat NAMC YS-11 aircraft and flew to destinations in Oklahoma and Texas, but was unable to operate profitably, ceasing flights and filing for bankruptcy in 1985.

Two airlines were formed from the assets of Braniff:
*Braniff, Inc, founded in 1983 by the Hyatt Corporation under the umbrella corporation Dalfort. The airline adopted a low-fare business model in 1984, only to collapse in late 1989, a victim of intense fare competition and mounting debts amid a general industry downturn.
*Braniff International Airlines, Inc., founded in 1991 by financier Jeffrey Chodorow, whose company BNAir, Inc. purchased the assets of the moribund Braniff, Inc. Plagued by intense competition and by turmoil and malfeasance in its own upper management, the reborn airline dissolved in 1992.

==Braniff today==

In early 2015, the private irrevocable Trust that owned and administered Braniff&#x27;s intellectual property and certain other company assets since 1983, released the assets to a private entity connected to the private Trust, which founded a series of new Braniff companies that were incorporated in the State of Oklahoma, for historical purposes and for administration of the Braniff trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property. These companies included Braniff Air Lines, Inc., Paul R. Braniff, Inc., Braniff Airways, Inc., Braniff International Hotels, Inc., and Braniff International Corporation. During 2017 and 2018, some of the original Braniff companies were reinstated for historical purposes and administration of Braniff&#x27;s intellectual property assets including those of Mid-Continent Airlines, Pan American Grace Airways and Long and Harman Airlines. However, in early 2022, the private Trust that originally owned Braniff&#x27;s intellectual property since 1983, reacquired these assets along with the original Braniff company and corresponding assets that it had previously owned.

The trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property of Braniff Airways, Inc., Braniff International Corporation and Braniff, Inc., Mid-Continent Airlines, Inc., and Panagra Pan American Grace Airways and Long and Harman Airlines, Inc., are currently owned by Braniff Airways, Incorporated, of The Braniff Building, 324 North Robinson Avenue, Suite 100, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Braniff&#x27;s mid-century themed travel posters, produced from 1946 to 1964, that depict travel scenes from destinations in Latin America and the U.S. mainland were produced in Lima, Peru, by Braniff&#x27;s advertising agency. These posters are therefore not placed in the public domain but have instead undergone copyright restoration in the United States. In addition, all of these posters have been marked as official common law trademarks of Braniff Airways, Inc., and they continue as a company trademark infinitely. Richard B. Cass serves as current chairman and CEO of the Braniff companies and the private irrevocable Trust that owns those companies.

==Fleet==

Braniff featured one of the youngest and most modern fleets in the industry. A planned retirement of older aircraft in tandem with the addition of approximately eight to ten new jets per year was followed throughout the 1970s. However, at the same time, the company retired four to six older jets each year.

Braniff International operated the following aircraft types during its existence:

== In popular culture ==

* In &quot;At Long Last Leave&quot;, the 500th episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Homer Simpson ties a &quot;Braniff&quot;-branded jet engine to an ATV.

* In the film &quot;Wall Street&quot;, Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) warns his father Carl (Martin Sheen), who is employed by an airline that his son wants to control, about how the fictional &quot;Blue Star Airlines&quot; will &quot;go right down the tubes just like Braniff!&quot;

==Incidents and accidents==
* July 12, 1931 – A Braniff Lockheed DL-1B Vega (NC8497) crashed shortly after takeoff from Chicago Airport, killing both pilots.
* December 8, 1934 – A Braniff Lockheed Vega 5C aircraft, registration NC106W crashed into a road embankment at approximately 5:20am near Columbia, Missouri, killing the pilot and destroying the aircraft. The service was a mail flight between Kansas City and Columbia. The Bureau of Air Commerce investigation report stated the likely cause was &quot;unexpected icing conditions which made the proper handling of the aircraft impossible&quot;.
* December 23, 1936 – A Braniff Lockheed Model 10 Electra airliner, registration NC14905, suffered an engine failure during a go-around while conducting a non-scheduled test flight at Dallas Love Field, Dallas, Texas; the pilot tried to turn back towards the airfield but lost control, causing the craft to spin into the northern shore of Bachman Lake. The six occupants of the Electra, all Braniff employees, died in the crash and ensuing fire.
* March 26, 1939 – Braniff Flight 1, operating from Chicago to Brownsville, Texas, crashed on takeoff from Oklahoma City Municipal Air Terminal, today known as Will Rogers World Airport. Early that March morning, the aircraft, a Douglas DC-2, registration NC13727, suffered an explosion in the left engine that, in turn, caused the engine&#x27;s cowling to open up, creating serious drag on the left wing. The flight&#x27;s captain, Claude Seaton, struggled to keep the aircraft stable while turning back for an emergency landing at Oklahoma City. The aircraft&#x27;s compromised wing hit an embankment on the section line road forming the airport&#x27;s western boundary and cartwheeled across the ground. Seaton ordered the aircraft&#x27;s fuel to be cut off, but in vain, as, when the plane came to rest on the ground, fuel came in contact with the still-hot engines and caught fire. Seaton and First Officer Malcolm Wallace were thrown free on impact and survived with serious injuries, which ended the flying career of the captain. Flight attendant Louise Zarr and seven passengers died in the post-crash fire.
* March 26, 1952 – Braniff Flight 65, a Douglas C-54A (N65143), ran off the runway at HAP Airport in Hugoton, Kansas, during an emergency landing following an unexplained fire in the number three engine. All 49 on board survived.
* May 15, 1953 – A Braniff Douglas DC-4 carrying 48 passengers and five crew slid off the end of Runway 36 at Dallas Love Field, crossed Lemmon Avenue, and plowed into an embankment. Despite reportedly heavy automobile traffic on the busy street, no vehicles were struck, and nobody aboard the airliner was seriously injured. The crash was attributed to poor braking action on the rain-slicked runway.
* August 22, 1954 – Braniff Flight 152 crashed 16 mi south of Mason City, Iowa, after encountering windshear in a thunderstorm, killing 12 of 19 on board. The aircraft was a Douglas C-47, registration N61451.
* July 17, 1955 – Braniff Flight 560 crashed at Chicago–Midway Airport after the pilot became disoriented during the approach, killing 22 of 43 on board. The aircraft was a Convair CV-340-22, registration N3422.
* March 25, 1958 – Braniff Flight 971 crashed near Miami International Airport while attempting to return to the airport after the number three engine caught fire, killing nine of 15 passengers; all five crew survived. The pilot had become preoccupied with the engine fire and failed to maintain altitude. The aircraft was a Douglas DC-7C, registration N5904.
* September 29, 1959 – Braniff Flight 542 crashed in Buffalo, Texas, while en route from Houston to Dallas, and the crash resulted in the deaths of twenty-nine passengers and five crew members. The plane, registration number N9705C, was an 11-day-old Lockheed L-188 Electra. The Civil Aeronautics Board blamed the crash on metal fatigue due to the &quot;whirl-mode&quot; prop theory.
* October 19, 1959 – A Braniff Boeing 707 crashed in Arlington, Washington. Although the aircraft was not officially a Braniff aircraft, it was due for delivery the very next day and was already wearing the Braniff logo and colors. The aircraft, a Boeing 707-227, registration number N7071, was on an orientation flight with two Boeing test pilots, and two Braniff Captains on board. The Braniff pilot performed a series of Dutch rolls; however, one of the rolls was executed beyond the maximum bank angle restrictions, resulting in a loss of control. The aircraft recovered from the maneuver, but, during the recovery, three of the engines (number 1, 2 and 4) were torn off. The aircraft crashed along the Stillaguamish River northeast of Arlington. The two pilots in the cockpit did not survive the emergency landing, the other two pilots who were sitting in the tail section did. A bare patch in the trees along the north bank of the river still exists today.
* September 14, 1960 – An airline maintenance inspector lost control of a Braniff International Airways Douglas DC-7C during a taxi test and crashed into the Braniff Operations and Maintenance Base hangar at high speed. The inspector died and five of the six mechanics aboard were injured. The aircraft brakes were set to bypass mode and braking action was not available when it was needed.
* November 14, 1961 – A Braniff DC-7C (N5905) was written off following a ground fire at Dallas Love Field.
* August 6, 1966 – Braniff Flight 250 crashed near Falls City, Nebraska, en route from Kansas City to Omaha after encountering severe thunderstorms in flight. Thirty-eight passengers and four crew members were killed in the crash. The plane was a BAC One-Eleven 203, registration N1553.
* May 3, 1968 – Braniff Flight 352 crashed in Dawson, Texas while en route to Dallas from Houston, killing eighty passengers and five crew members. The plane was a Lockheed Electra II, registration N9707C. The crash was caused by the pilot&#x27;s decision to enter an area of severe thunderstorms, and the aircraft suffered stresses beyond its design limits and broke apart.
* July 2, 1971 – Braniff Flight 14, a Boeing 707 flying from Acapulco to New York with 102 passengers and a crew of eight was hijacked on approach to a refueling stop in San Antonio, Texas. After a refueling stop in Monterrey, the hijackers released flight attendants Jeanette Eatman Crepps, Iris Kay Williams, and Anita Bankert Mayer and all of the passengers. The remaining crew of Captain Dale Bessant, Bill Wallace, Phillip Wray, and flight attendants Ernestina Garcia and Margaret Susan Harris flew on to Lima. The hijackers, a U.S. Navy deserter named Robert Jackson and his female Guatemalan companion, demanded and received ransom of $100,000 and wanted to go to Algeria. The Bessant crew was released, one by one, and replaced by a volunteer crew of Captain Al Schroeder, Bill Mizell, Bob Williams and Navigator Ken McWhorter. Two Lima-based employees, Delia Arizola and Clorinda Ortoneda, volunteered to board the flight. Arizola had been retired 6 months but still offered her services. The 707 left for Rio and planned to refuel but the hijackers forced them on to Buenos Aires. The long flight and fatigue took its toll and the hijackers gave up. The incident was a record for long-distance hijacking, over 7,500 miles, and lasted 43 hours.
* January 12, 1972 – Braniff Flight 38, a Boeing 727, was hijacked as it departed Houston bound for Dallas. The lone armed hijacker, Billy Gene Hurst Jr., allowed all 94 passengers to deplane after landing at Dallas Love Field but continued to hold the seven crew members hostage, demanding to fly to South America and asking for US$2 million, parachutes, and jungle survival gear, among other items. After a six-hour standoff, the entire crew secretly fled while Hurst was distracted examining the contents of a package delivered by Dallas police. Police officers stormed the craft shortly afterwards and arrested Hurst without serious incident.

<text>VEB Kombinat Robotron () (or simply Robotron) was the largest East German electronics manufacturer. It was headquartered in Dresden and employed 68,000 people in 1989. Its products included personal computers, SM EVM minicomputers, the ESER mainframe computers, various computer peripherals as well as microcomputers, radios, television sets and other items including cookie press &quot;Kleingebäckpresse Typ 102&quot;.

==Divisions==
Robotron managed several different divisions:
*VEB Robotron-Elektronik Dresden (headquarters) — typewriters, personal computers, minicomputers, mainframes
*VEB Robotron-Meßelektronik Dresden — measurement and testing devices, home computers
*VEB Robotron-Projekt Dresden — software department
*VEB Robotron-Buchungsmaschinenwerk Karl-Marx-Stadt — personal computers, floppy disk drives
*VEB Robotron-Elektronik Hoyerswerda — monitors, power supply units
*VEB Robotron-Elektronik Radeberg — mainframes, radio receivers, portable television receivers, directional radio systems
*VEB Robotron Vertrieb Dresden, Berlin and Erfurt — sales departments
*VEB Robotron-Elektronik Zella-Mehlis — computer terminals, hard disk drives
*VEB Robotron-Büromaschinenwerk Sömmerda — personal computers, printers, electronic calculators (Soemtron 220, 222, 224), invoicing machines (EFA 380), punched card indexers and sorters (Soemtron 432).
*VEB Robotron Elektronik Riesa — printed circuit boards
*VEB Robotron-Anlagenbau Leipzig — general contractor, design and assembly for computer and process calculation systems in the GDR and export, training center

On 30 June 1990, &quot;Kombinat&quot; Robotron was liquidated and its divisions were converted into corporations. In the 1990s, these companies were sold, e.g. to Siemens Nixdorf and IBM, or liquidated. Less than five percent of the employees were able to switch to successor companies. However, the abundance of highly qualified workers promoted the subsequent settlement of various companies in the region.

&quot;Robotron Datenbank-Software GmbH&quot; is a company which emerged from one of the former divisions of &quot;Kombinat Robotron&quot;. It was newly founded on 23 August 1990, just before German reunification.

==Robotron hardware and software==
Robotron product series include:
* &quot;Midrange computer&quot; EDVA (based on IBM 1401),
* &quot;R 4000&quot; and &quot;R 4200&quot; computers (based on Honeywell Series 16),
* ES EVM systems , &quot;EC 1055&quot;, &quot;EC 1056&quot;, &quot;EC 1057&quot; (based on IBM System/360, IBM System/370),
* Minicomputer and Superminicomputer (DEC PDP-11), K 1840 (VAX 11/780), K 1820 (MicroVAX II),
* Office and personal computers A 5120, PC 1715, , , , (IBM XT), (IBM AT),
* OEM modular microcomputer systems &quot;K 1510&quot;, , &quot;K 1700&quot;
* Operating systems such as Single User Control Program (based on CP/M), , &quot;Disk Control Program&quot; [de] (based on MS-DOS), and SIOS (an in-house development).

==Rebranding of products==
Robotron printers were sold in Western Germany as &quot;Soemtron&quot; or &quot;Präsident&quot;, and the West German branch of Commodore used some Robotron parts for their printers.

In East Germany, Epson printers were sold under the Robotron brand that still had the Epson logo on the back.

==K 1520 bus standard==
The K 1520 bus was an early computer bus, created by VEB Robotron in 1980 and specified in TGL 37271/01. It was the predominant computer bus architecture of microcomputer-sized systems of East Germany, whose industry relied heavily on the U880 microprocessor, a clone of the Zilog Z80.

Among the large number of boards developed using the standard were CPU modules, RAM modules, graphics cards, magnetic tape controllers and floppy disk controllers.

It was originally intended to be used to connect boards to backplanes, as in the modular microcomputer system, A 5120 office computer, A 5130 office computer and the Poly-Play arcade cabinet.

But it was also used as an expansion bus for computers that featured a mainboard such as 
* PC 1715 office computer - with 2 internal slots, one being occupied by the floppy disk controller
* KC 85/2, KC 85/3, KC 85/4 microcomputers - with two internal slots for expansion cartridges and one back-side connector for:
** D002 - expansion unit for 4 additional expansion cartridges
** D004 - a floppy controller subsystem plus 2 cartridge slots
* KC 87 microcomputer - a.k.a. Z 9001 and KC 85/1
* Z 1013, a home computer - consumer product in kit form
* BIC A 5105 [de] educational microcomputer - not produced in significant quantities
* KC compact late home computer - not produced in meaningful quantities
The bus had 58 pins and was commonly physically represented by a two-row connector with 29 pins each. The following signals and connections were used:
* DB0 ... DB7 (bidirectional data bus)
* AB0 ... AB15 (address bus)
* /MREQ, /IORQ, /RD, /WR, /RFSH, /M1, /WAIT, /HALT, /INT, /NMI, /BUSRQ, /RESET (Z80 control signals)
* /BAI, /BOA /BUSACK (bus priority chain)
* /IEI, IEO (interrupt enable priority chain)
* /IODI, /MEMDI, /RDY (access control)
* clock, +5V, -5V, +12V, ground

<doc id="383833" wikidata="Q523919" url="?curid=383833" title="Implosion (mechanical process)">
<text>Implosion is the collapse of an object into itself from a pressure differential or gravitational force. The opposite of explosion (which expands the volume), implosion reduces the volume occupied and concentrates matter and energy. Implosion involves a difference between internal (lower) and external (higher) pressure, or inward and outward forces, that is so large that the structure collapses inward into itself, or into the space it occupied if it is not a completely solid object. Examples of implosion include a submarine being crushed by hydrostatic pressure and the collapse of a star under its own gravitational pressure. 

In some but not all cases, an implosion propels material outward, for example due to the force of inward falling material rebounding, or peripheral material being ejected as the inner parts collapse. If the object was previously solid, then implosion usually requires it to take on a more dense form—in effect to be more concentrated, compressed, or converted into a denser material.

== Examples ==

===Nuclear weapons===
In an implosion-type nuclear weapon design, a sphere of plutonium, uranium, or other fissile material is imploded by a spherical arrangement of explosive charges. This decreases the material&#x27;s volume and thus increases its density by a factor of two to three, causing it to reach critical mass and create a nuclear explosion.

In some forms of thermonuclear weapons, the energy from this explosion is then used to implode a capsule of fusion fuel before igniting it, causing a fusion reaction (see Teller–Ulam design). In general, the use of radiation to implode something, as in a hydrogen bomb or in laser driven inertial confinement fusion, is known as radiation implosion.

===Fluid dynamics===
Cavitation (bubble formation/collapse in a fluid) involves an implosion process. When a cavitation bubble forms in a liquid (for example, by a high-speed water propeller), this bubble is typically rapidly collapsed—imploded—by the surrounding liquid.

===Astrophysics===
Implosion is a key part of the gravitational collapse of large stars, which can lead to the creation of supernovas, neutron stars and black holes. 

In the most common case, the innermost part of a large star (called the core) stops burning and without this source of heat, the forces holding electrons and protons apart are no longer strong enough to do so. The core collapses in on itself exceedingly quickly, and becomes a neutron star or black hole; the outer layers of the original star fall inwards and may rebound off the newly created neutron star (if one was created), creating a supernova.

=== Cathode-ray tube and fluorescent lighting implosion ===
A high vacuum exists within all cathode-ray tubes. If the outer glass envelope is damaged, a dangerous implosion may occur. The implosion may scatter glass pieces at dangerous speeds. While modern CRTs used in televisions and computer displays have epoxy-bonded face-plates or other measures to prevent shattering of the envelope, CRTs removed from equipment must be handled carefully to avoid injury.


===Controlled structure demolition===

The demolition of large buildings using precisely placed and timed explosions so that the structure collapses on itself is often erroneously described as &quot;implosion&quot;.

<text>The Republic of China Military Academy (), also known as the Chinese Military Academy (CMA), is the service academy for the Republic of China Army. It was founded by the Republic of China as the Whampoa Military Academy at Huangpu (Whampoa), Guangzhou in 1924. At the end of the Chinese Civil War the academy evacuated to the island of Taiwan and took its current name. Its graduates participated in the Northern Expedition, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War.

==Establishment==
By 1924, the Kuomintang (KMT) wanted to build a modern, and politically-reliable armed force. The KMT received money, materiel, and advisors from the Soviet Union; military advisors provided training and began reorganizing the KMT&#x27;s forces along Soviet lines. As part of the reforms, political commissars were introduced for political and technical training and, in 1924, the KMT&#x27;s 1st National Congress approved the creation of the Whampoa Military Academy to train junior officers for the what would become the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). The academy was established in May 1924 on Changzhou Island in Huangpu, Guangzhou with Chiang Kai-shek as superintendent. Liao Zhongkai, the KMT treasury secretary, was the party&#x27;s representative to the academy. Sun Yat-sen took the ceremonial position of the academy&#x27;s premier.

==Early years==

The Chinese faculty included graduates from the Baoding Military Academy, the Yunnan Military Academy, and the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. There were also a small number of Soviet instructors trained at the Frunze Military Academy; they were the academy&#x27;s primary instructors. Members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were admitted as faculty and students as part of the First United Front. The political instructors were mostly Communists, as was the their director, Zhou Enlai. The later People&#x27;s Liberation Army also recruited Whampoa graduates.

The academy&#x27;s provided a 6-12 month military-political program incorporating Western pedagogical methods and practical exercises. Military training was primarily infantry-focused, but also included classes for artillery, engineers, logistics, and heavy weapons. Political training was based on Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Three Principles of the People, KMT history, and Western politics and economics. The program was inferior to those provided by contemporary professional armies, but it gave the NRA an advantage over the less professional Chinese armies of the Warlord Era. The first class of 490 graduated in November.

The academy formed the first &quot;model&quot; regiment in October 1924, which suppressed a insurrection of angry merchants and their private militia forces late that month. The Whampoa force operated successfully during the Guangdong–Guangxi War and the Yunnan–Guangxi War before becoming the foundation of the NRA.

By the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 the majority of Chinese divisions were commanded by Whampoa graduates.
==Relocations==

The original academy operated until 1926. In 1928, following the Northern Expedition, it was relocated to Nanjing, the new capital, and renamed as the Central Military Academy. The CMA evacuated to Chengdu in 1938 during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

At the end of the Chinese Civil War, the CMA evacuated to Kaohsiung on Taiwan and was renamed to the Republic of China Military Academy.

The site of the Whampoa Military Academy is now a museum.

==In Taiwan==
In June 2024, President Lai Ching-te visited the ROC Military Academy on the occasion of its 100th anniversary celebration.

<text>John Anthony Fonblanque (12 June 1759 – 4 January 1837) was an English politician and barrister.

==Early life and name==
Born John Anthony Fonblanque, he was the son of Jean de Grenier de Fonblanque, a banker, naturalised as Jean Fonblanque, 

He was educated at Harrow School and Oxford. In 1828, late in life, he changed his surname by royal licence to de Grenier Fonblanque. He was descended from a Huguenot family, his father having exchanged the surname de Grenier de Fonblanque for that of Fonblanque on his naturalisation in England.

==Career==
He was commissioned as a Ensign in the Berkshire Militia in 1780. The regiment was disembodied in March 1783. 

Called to the bar at the Middle Temple, 24 January 1783, Fonblanque distinguished himself in 1791 as leading counsel at the bar of the House of Commons on behalf of the merchants of London in opposition to the Quebec bill.

Fonblanque was the author of the very extensive notes forming the useful body of the standard legal work, &quot;Treatise on Equity&quot; nominally ascribed to Henry Ballow. This revised edition was first published in 1793-1794; the fifth London edition appeared in 1820.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Camelford 1802–1806 as a member of the Whig party following members of his wife&#x27;s family, Samuel Martin and Sir Ralph Payne. Financial troubles brought an end to his political career by 1810.

He was one of the Whig &quot;friends&quot; of King George IV when Prince of Wales and is also said to have been a personal friend of his Royal Highness. He is supposed to have written the celebrated letters to the King on the subject of his Royal Highness&#x27;s exclusion from the army which were generally attributed to Lord Moira.

Made King&#x27;s Counsel on 28 April 1804, his brilliant early reputation meant he was spoken of as a future Whig Lord Chancellor. Vanity led Fonblanque into debt in 1807–08, and money problems, his wife left him in 1834, remained with him and his family the rest of his life. In later years he withdrew a great deal from the profession. It was said that Lord Eldon hearing that his library was to be sold purchased it and presented it to him.

==Family==
John Anthony Fonblanque died on 4 January 1837 in his 77th year, still confined to the area just outside the debtors&#x27; prison, retaining his faculties to the last and &quot;with perfect resignation&quot;.

On 30 May 1786, he married Frances Caroline Fitzgerald (1760–1844), sister of the poet William Thomas Fitzgerald and daughter of Colonel John Austen Fitzgerald and Henrietta Martin sister of Samuel Martin, and with her he was father of:
*John Samuel Martin Fonblanque (March 1787 – 2 November 1865).
*Thomas Fonblanque (26 January 1793 – 1861), Her Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Consul General and Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in Serbia and father of historian Edward Barrington de Fonblanque of the War Office.
*Albany Fonblanque (1 October 1794 – 13 October 1872).
*Three daughters : Caroline, Harriott and Eliza.

==Publications==
*&quot;A serious exhortation to the Electors of Great Britain&quot; House of Commons, 1791
*&quot;Thoughts on the Canada Bill, Now Depending in Parliament&quot; 1791
*&quot;A Treatise on Equity, with the addition of marginal references and notes&quot; in two volumes, 1792 (5th edition J &amp; W T Clarke, 1820)
*&quot;The case of Samuel Howe Showers Esq., Lieutenant Colonel in the military service of the East India Company at Calcutta to which is subjoined the opinions of Mr. Erskine and Mr. Fonblanque thereon&quot; 1796
*&quot;Doubts as to the expediency of adopting the recommendation of the bullion committee&quot; 1810
*&quot;The revised opinion of John Fonblanque on the case of the Baron de Bode&quot; 1834 (a dispute concerning compensation for lands seized in France during the revolution)

<text>Sylvania&#x27;s MOBIDIC, short for &quot;MOBIle DIgital Computer&quot;, was a transistorized computer intended to store, sort and route information as one part of the United States Army&#x27;s Fieldata concept. Fieldata aimed to automate the distribution of battlefield data in any form, ensuring the delivery of reports to the proper recipients regardless of the physical form they were sent or received. MOBIDIC was mounted in the trailer of a semi-trailer truck, while a second supplied power, allowing it to be moved about the battlefield. The Army referred to the system as the AN/MYK-1, or AN/MYK-2 for the dual-CPU version, Sylvania later offered a commercial version as the S 9400.

==History==
In early 1956 the Army Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth released a contract tender for the development of a van-mounted mobile computer as part of their Fieldata efforts. Fieldata envisioned a system where any sort of reports would be converted into text format and then sent electronically around an extended battlefield. At the recipient&#x27;s end, it would be converted into an appropriate output, often on a line printer or similar device. By automating the process of routing the messages in the middle of the information flow, the Signal Corps was hoping to guarantee delivery and improve responsiveness. Fieldata can be thought of as a general purpose version of the system the US Air Force was developing in their SAGE system, which did the same task but limited to the field of information about aircraft locations and status.

The heart of Fieldata would be computer systems that would receive, store, prioritize and send the messages. The machines would have to be built using transistors in order to meet the size and power requirements, so in effect, the Army was paying to develop transistorized computers. In spite of this, most established players ignored the Army&#x27;s calls for the small machine. Sylvania&#x27;s director of development speculated that the Army&#x27;s terminology in the contract may have hidden the apparent wonderful opportunity. In the end, RCA and Sylvania entered bids, along with a number of smaller companies with unproven track records. Sylvania&#x27;s bid was the lower of the &quot;big two&quot;, and they won the contract in September 1956.

The first experimental machine, retroactively known as MOBIDIC A, was delivered to Fort Monmouth in December 1959. By this time the Army had expressed increasing interest in the concept and had ordered four additional machines and associated software, including a COBOL compiler. The original contract for the experimental machine was for $1.6 million, but the new developments increased the total to between $20 and $30 million.

MOBIDIC B was supplied to the Army&#x27;s Tactical Operations Center and featured dual CPUs for increased reliability.

MOBIDIC A/B weighed about .

MOBIDIC C was sent to Fort Huachuca as a software testing system. MOBIDIC D was ordered for the Army Security Agency in Europe, and MOBIDIC 7A was shipped to the 7th Army Stock Control Center in Zweibrücken, Germany. 7A&#x27;s service entry was delayed due to the failure of the Army-supplied tape drives, but Sylvania replaced these with off-the-shelf commercial units and the system went operational in January 1962, the first off-shore deployment.

MOBIDIC C/D/7A weighed about .

The 7A unit was extremely successful in operation, cutting the time needed to order and deliver spare parts dramatically. Although Fieldata was developed for battlefield information, MOBIDIC was just as useful for other sorts of information as well, as the 7A machine demonstrated. It was so successful that the MOBIDIC D was diverted to the Army&#x27;s 3922nd Ordnance Supply Control Agency in Orléans, France (Maison Fort) to replace the existing RAMAC 305 card system.

By 1962, however, the Army had lost interest in Fieldata and canceled the project. The B machine was no longer needed for Fieldata software development, and in 1965 it was purchased by the National Bureau of Standards for software development and research. The C, D, and 7A machines were later all moved to Karlsruhe, Germany, where they operated in the supply role for years.

MOBIDIC&#x27;s success, independent of Fieldata&#x27;s failure, led to additional Army contracts for the smaller AN/APQ-32 computers, which processed artillery radar data. The basic layout of the MOBIDIC system was also used for the AN/ASD-1 computer used on the Boeing RC-135 ELINT aircraft, the PARADE and TIDEWATER projects, and its basic circuitry was used extensively in the development of the IBM 7090 for the BMEWS systems.

As Sylvania had hoped, commercial interest in a small, low-cost, robust computer system seemed widespread. MOBIDIC was adapted into the Sylvania 9400 that was marketed towards factory automation systems. Two systems were ordered, one by the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence in the Pentagon, and another by General Telephone in California. However, as the costs of trying to compete in the commercial computer market became clear, Sylvania decided to withdraw from the market, and General Telephone canceled their order. Both 9400&#x27;s were built; General Telephone&#x27;s intended delivery was used by Sylvania internally.

==Description==

MOBIDIC&#x27;s design goal was the real time operation of its input/output system. A typical use for MOBIDIC would be to collate all the messages flowing through an input to different tape outputs based on a field in the data. The tapes could then be removed and the messages printed on an offline printer. For instance, a large supply depot might have numerous warehouses for different sorts of materials; MOBIDIC could route incoming requests by examining the part number and then sending that message to a particular tape. All of the output on that tape would then be printed and sent to the associated warehouse. MOBIDIC replaced many manual steps; it performed the collation lookup, sorting the data, and collecting all the printed messages for delivery.

MOBIDIC was a 36-bit binary machine, a common word size for early computers. The system used 36-bit data throughout, but stored it as 40-bit values to add additional sign and parity bits, and two spares. This allowed it to store the full range from -(1 - 2−36) to +(1 - 2−36). Machines were normally equipped with two parallel banks of core memory with 4096 words each, but was expandable to seven banks maximum. It could support up to 63 tape drives, punch tape input and output, as well as a Flexowriter. One connection could also be dedicated to sending data to another MOBIDIC system. The tape drives used one of the spare bits in the 40-bit word as a STOP indicator.

Most of the 52 instructions were in the one-address format, collecting into an accumulator, but a small number (load, move, etc.) were in two-address format. There were 15 arithmetic, eight transfer (memory), 17 logic, three sense and nine input-output instructions. An add required 16 microseconds, a multiply or divide 86, these slow times a side effect of its serial operation.

MOBIDIC&#x27;s CPU and I/O systems were housed in a 30-foot (10 meters) van. The machine required 29.76 kW of power, which was supplied from a second, smaller, van containing a generator set. Two other vans contained auxiliary EAM equipment and a repair shop. All four vans were backed up; two to a side, to a raised wooden platform with steps on one end. As this was the Cold War era, in case of enemy attack, everything could be moved instead of having to be abandoned and destroyed.

The dual-CPU MOBIDIC B (only one was produced) included three additional general instructions, as well as nine new instructions for supporting subroutines. The CPUs were independent but shared a single main memory consisting of 8,192 words of core. In a sample use, one of the CPUs would be used to import data, handing off data via shared memory to the second for output. Although the machine&#x27;s speed was slower overall (adds were 42 μs), throughput could be greatly improved. If one of the machines failed, the program could be restarted on the remaining CPU, running both sides of the I/O task with reduced throughput.

<text>Joseph Alberto Santiago (born June 10, 1965) is a Filipino-American guitarist and composer. Active since 1986, Santiago is best known as the co-founder and lead guitarist of the alternative rock band Pixies. After the band&#x27;s breakup in 1993, Santiago produced musical scores for film and television documentaries, and he formed The Martinis with his ex-wife, Linda Mallari. He also contributed to albums by Charles Douglas and former Pixies band-mate Frank Black. Santiago resumed his role as the Pixies&#x27; lead guitarist when they reunited in 2004.

Santiago has described his guitar technique as &quot;angular and bent&quot;, and he cites Les Paul, George Harrison, Chet Atkins, Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass and Jimi Hendrix as major influences on his style. His guitar playing, as part of the Pixies&#x27; sound, was held in high regard by critics: MTV&#x27;s Laurel Bowman commented that Santiago&#x27;s &quot;sonic plow was the key element in the Pixies&#x27; monstrous presence&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Santiago was born in Manila, Philippines, on June 10, 1965, the third of six sons of an anesthesiologist. In 1972, when President Marcos declared martial law, the family immigrated to the United States. After two years in Yonkers, New York, the family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where Santiago attended Longmeadow High School and graduated from Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy in 1983. His first experience with a musical instrument was playing a Hammond organ at the age of eight, but he never took on the instrument seriously because he had to share it with five brothers. Santiago first played a guitar at the age of nine after he noticed a classical guitar hanging on his oldest brother&#x27;s wall for decoration. The first song he learned to play was The Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;.

As a teenager, Santiago became interested in computer programming, naming his first program &quot;Iggy&quot; and his second &quot;Pop&quot; after punk rocker Iggy Pop. He participated in a cycle ride across the United States in aid of charity, but on completing it did not bother to collect the sponsor&#x27;s money.

After graduating from high school in 1983, Santiago studied at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He remained without a major as long as the university would permit him to, but eventually chose economics. He met Charles Thompson, an anthropology student and the future Pixies frontman, after he heard Thompson and his roommate playing their guitars. Santiago rushed home to collect his guitar, and was soon playing &quot;non-blues-scale, non-cover-song rock&quot; with Thompson.

Santiago and Thompson shared a room at the start of the second semester. Santiago soon introduced his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: &quot;Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We&#x27;d go to shows, I remember seeing Black Flag and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music ... He&#x27;d write &#x27;em [the songs], and I&#x27;d throw my ideas on the guitar.&quot; In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to Puerto Rico as an exchange student. After six months there living with a &quot;weird, psycho roommate,&quot; Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words &quot;We gotta do it, now is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams&quot;; Santiago replied, saying &quot;Yes, now&#x27;s the time.&quot; Upon receiving this reply, Thompson decided to return to Amherst to start a rock band with Santiago.

== Career ==

=== Pixies ===

Upon Thompson&#x27;s return to Massachusetts, the pair dropped out of college and moved to Boston. They both took temporary jobs in warehouses, with Santiago working for a butcher block company. In January 1986, Santiago formed the Pixies with Thompson. Santiago made the choice to play lead guitar over Bass. The pair arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word randomly from a dictionary and liked the definition, &quot;mischievous little elves.&quot; They recruited Kim Deal a week later after placing a classified ad in a Boston paper for a bassist &quot;into Hüsker Dü and Peter, Paul and Mary.&quot; Drummer David Lovering was later hired on recommendation from Deal&#x27;s husband.

The Pixies rehearsed throughout 1986, and began performing around Boston in late 1986 and during 1987. The band signed to the English independent record label 4AD in 1987. On meeting the head of the label, Ivo Watts-Russell, Santiago remarked: &quot;All I care about is that you make me famous in the Philippines because all the chicks are really pretty&quot;. Watts-Russell later said &quot;that&#x27;s probably all I ever heard Joey really say,&quot; and by that time, Santiago&#x27;s quietness had been noted by those close to the band. The Pixies&#x27; first release, &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;, featured his trademark angular lead guitar on tracks such as &quot;The Holiday Song&quot; and &quot;Vamos&quot;.

After the band&#x27;s next two albums, &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; (1988) and &quot;Doolittle&quot; (1989), the relationship between the band members became strained; the Pixies were constantly touring and had released three albums in two years. During their homecoming Boston concert, on the post-&quot;Doolittle&quot; &quot;Fuck or Fight&quot; tour, Santiago smashed up his instrument and stormed offstage. The band announced a break soon afterwards. During this time, Santiago visited the Grand Canyon to &quot;find himself.&quot; After the band reconvened in 1990, Santiago contributed to the band&#x27;s later releases, &quot;Bossanova&quot; (1990) and &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; (1991), adopting a surf guitar style in the former. The Pixies eventually broke up in 1992, mostly due to tensions between Francis and Deal, although the breakup was not publicly announced until 1993.

=== The Martinis and composing ===
After the breakup of the Pixies, Santiago went into a depression for the first couple of years but remained on good terms with bandmate Black Francis (who soon adopted the name Frank Black). Black, who was recording his 1993 debut album, &quot;Frank Black&quot;, contacted Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago agreed, and moved into Black&#x27;s old apartment in L.A. on a whim. Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black&#x27;s solo albums, including &quot;Teenager of the Year&quot; (1994), and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Mangled&quot;. He also formed The Martinis a year later with Mallari. Their recorded output by the end of the 1990s comprised a single song, the self-recorded &quot;Free&quot; (1995), which appeared on the film soundtrack of &quot;Empire Records&quot;. The band played live only occasionally until 2001.

In the mid-1990s, Santiago began to explore audio editing software. After composing for several independent films, including &quot;Crime and Punishment in Suburbia&quot; in 2000 (where he collaborated again with Black), Santiago co-scored the Fox Network TV series &quot;Undeclared&quot; with Michael Andrews. He continued to contribute lead guitar to albums, collaborating with Charles Douglas on his 2004 album &quot;Statecraft&quot;. He scored the 2003 film &quot;The Low Budget Time Machine&quot; and wrote two songs, &quot;Birthday Video&quot; and &quot;Fake Purse&quot;, for the Showtime television series &quot;Weeds&quot; in 2005.

Mallari and Santiago continued to write new material as part of the Martinis, but no longer played live. Their debut album, &quot;Smitten&quot;, took two years to write and was released in 2004; the pair collaborated with a number of musicians, including drummer Josh Freese, during the recording. Santiago described the album as &quot;a lot poppier and quirkier&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous material. The band simultaneously released &quot;The Smitten Sessions&quot;, a limited edition EP.

=== Pixies reunion and future projects ===
After the Pixies broke up in 1993, Santiago had stayed in touch with every band member. In the summer of 2003, Black decided to begin reuniting the Pixies and called Santiago first. Santiago later explained: &quot;He called me on my cellphone and I was in Cape Cod visiting family. He said in this coy voice, &#x27;Hey Joey, uh, you been hearin&#x27; these rumors that we&#x27;re getting back together? Gee, I wonder who started it?&#x27; I go, &#x27;Charles, did you do that?&#x27; and he goes, &#x27;Yeah.&#x27;&quot; Santiago then contacted Lovering and Deal to inform them of Black&#x27;s decision and by the summer of 2004 the band had reunited. DreamWorks asked the Pixies in early 2004 to compose a song for the &quot;Shrek 2&quot; soundtrack. They agreed, and early versions of this new song were recorded in Santiago&#x27;s basement. With his soundtrack experience, the band, in the words of Deal, &quot;worked it up a bit in Joey&#x27;s Pro Tools thing&quot;, before submitting it to the studio. DreamWorks rejected the song, so the band released it as a single, &quot;Bam Thwok&quot;.

Aside from the Pixies and The Martinis, Santiago scored the soundtrack of the documentary &quot;Radiant City&quot; in 2006. He signed with the commercial sound agency Elias Arts in the same year, and focused on composing music for television commercials. In a March 2006 Billboard.com interview, he dismissed the possibility of a new Pixies album for the time being: &quot;I&#x27;d only be interested if it happens in an organic manner; if all our schedules are aligned and we&#x27;re all feeling it. That&#x27;s the only reason to do it.&quot; Santiago also played a benefit concert for drummer Wally Ingram in February 2007 as part of The Martinis; the band&#x27;s first gig for six years.

==Musical style==
Santiago describes his guitar playing as &quot;angular and bent,&quot; &quot;all derived from guitar moments that perk my ears up&quot;. Notable in his style is how he uses distortion and feedback to leave spaces open. A good example is the intro of &quot;There Goes My Gun&quot;. He attributes much of his style to songs he enjoyed when first learning the guitar, such as The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot;, where &quot;George Harrison played that bent note that I fell in love with and later milked it for all it was worth.&quot; He used such techniques with the Pixies: &quot;Doolittle&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Dead&quot; begins with Santiago&#x27;s guitar &quot;squawking&quot; on an E-flat like &quot;a wounded animal&quot;. As Santiago was learning the guitar, he saw himself as a self-conscious amateur, and still speaks of a lack of confidence in his playing.

Santiago, rather than listening to popular radio, borrowed rock and roll records from the public library as he was growing up; he first discovered Les Paul and Jimi Hendrix, who led to jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. Santiago later commented on Montgomery&#x27;s influence: &quot;And that&#x27;s when I said, &#x27;Ah, that&#x27;s a hook. That&#x27;s some hooky stuff in the jazz world&#x27;&quot;. He discovered jazz and country artists such as Joe Pass and Chet Atkins after studying the liner notes of albums. Santiago was directly influenced by the &quot;Hendrix chord&quot;, the sharp 9th dominant chord which, in the words of author Ben Sisario, &quot;tapped a hidden rage that matched the horror of Thompson&#x27;s scream&quot;. As a teenager, Santiago also listened to classic rock and proto-punk artists such as The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Velvet Underground and Iggy Pop.

The stage antics of Santiago often contrasted with his generally quiet demeanor; he often experimented with his guitar and equipment during songs. Deal&#x27;s husband, John Murphy, said that during performances of &quot;Vamos&quot;, which features guitar feedback throughout, Santiago used to &quot;whack the crap out of his amp&quot;, often picking up the amplifier and moving it around. During some solos, Santiago would often pull the guitar up to his mouth and break guitar strings with his teeth.

== Personal life ==
Santiago has two children. He lives in Los Angeles. In 2016, Santiago checked into a rehabilitation center to treat his alcohol and drug issues. He has since become sober.

In March 2022, Santiago announced that he was engaged to producer Erin Whitaker, the CEO of ParkerWhitaker Productions.

<doc id="383853" wikidata="Q3434145" url="?curid=383853" title="Rob Anders">
<text>Robert J. Anders (born April 1, 1972) is a former Canadian politician. He represented the riding of Calgary West from 1997 until 2015 and was a founding member of the Conservative Party of Canada.

On April 12, 2014, Anders was defeated by former provincial minister Ron Liepert for the Conservative nomination in Calgary Signal Hill, which included the bulk of his former riding, for the next federal election.

On September 20, 2014, Anders was defeated for a second time in an attempt to gain the nomination in Bow River by Brooks mayor Martin Shields.

==Early life==
Anders was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He graduated from the University of Calgary with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. At the time of his first election in 1997 he served as the director of Canadians Against Forced Unionism.

==Parliamentary career==
Anders was first elected as the Reform Party MP for Calgary West in 1997, at age 25. The seat had been vacated when the former MP for the riding, Stephen Harper, resigned in 1996. It was expected that Anders would run in a by-election, but the 1997 election was called earlier than expected.

===Bills introduced===
In March 2003 Anders introduced Bill C-414 as a private members&#x27; bill. It was entitled &quot;An Act to amend the Special Economic Measures Act (no foreign aid to countries that do not respect religious freedom).&quot; The purpose of the bill was to stop Canadian government from spending the foreign aid budget in countries that did not allow for religious freedom.

Anders introduced Bill C-570 on January 29, 2014, which would amend the criminal code to provide for mandatory minimum sentences for rape.

===36th Parliament (1997–2000)===
Anders was elected as a member of the Reform Party (1997–2000) and converted to the Canadian Alliance in 2000.

Anders served in several different critic roles in opposition. First as critic of the Senate from June 16, 1998, to 1999 as well as associate critic for Human Resource Development from his first election to July 31, 2000. In August 2000 he was appointed associate critic for Citizenship and Immigration.

Along with fellow newly elected MPs Jason Kenney, Monte Solberg, Rahim Jaffer and advisor Ezra Levant, Anders was part of an up-and-coming group of young Reformers which pundits dubbed the &quot;Snack Pack&quot; due to their relative youth - all aged under 30; and girth.

===37th Parliament (2001–2004)===
On June 18, 2001, he became associate critic for National Defence, until appointed critic for Civil Preparedness from Jan 22, 2004 until the 2004 election.

Over time Anders has served in several leadership roles on parliamentary committees. In the 37th Canadian Parliament he was the vice-chair of the Subcommittee on National Security of the Standing Committee on Justice, Human Rights, Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.

Anders was the sole parliamentarian to vote against making Nelson Mandela an honorary citizen of Canada in 2001, which prevented the act from passing unanimously. He defended his actions by stating that Mandela was a communist and a terrorist, causing widespread criticism. As a result, during the next two federal elections, Anders was the target of a mostly unsuccessful non-partisan &quot;Vote Out Rob Anders&quot; campaign in his riding, but his popular vote percentage increased in every federal election since he was first elected in the 1997 Canadian federal election.

Anders was a supporter of Stephen Harper&#x27;s successful 2002 bid for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance, providing significant assistance with the campaign&#x27;s phone-banking.

===38th Parliament (2004–2005)===
In the next parliament Anders became the co-chair of the Scrutiny of Regulations Committee.

In December 2005, Anders used public funds to send pamphlets to residents in Richmond, British Columbia, a constituency far removed from his own. The leaflets caused bewilderment for including a survey question about &quot;homosexual sex marriage&quot; in a flyer otherwise addressing crime and crystal meth abuse.

===39th Parliament (2006–2008)===
In the 39th Canadian Parliament, after the Conservatives came to power, he was elected chair of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs.

===40th Parliament (2008–2011)===
In the 40th Canadian Parliament he had three different committee leadership jobs: vice-chair of the Government Operations and Estimates Committee, vice-chair of Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates and co-chair of Library of Parliament Committee.

Anders has been a consistent critic of the human rights record of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He has described the PRC as &quot;the worst human-rights abuser in the world,&quot; and compared the 2008 Beijing Olympics to the 1936 Berlin Olympics. He argued that &quot;China is the wrong choice to host the Games... I absolutely 100% think it compares to the Berlin Olympics in 1936.&quot; Anders highlights that the fact that Falun Gong practitioners are not allowed to participate in the Olympics is comparable with Adolf Hitler&#x27;s issue with Jewish participation in the 1936 Berlin Olympics.&quot; Anders has also said that no Canadian politician should attend the games, nor should any Canadian athletes be used as &quot;propaganda tools.&quot; His comments were criticized by local Chinese trade association as well as fellow Calgary Tory MP Deepak Obhrai, who disclaimed Anders &quot;was speaking as an individual and his comments are not reflective of government policy.&quot;

In February 2010, nineteen members of Anders&#x27; Calgary West riding association resigned &quot;en masse&quot;, citing interference from the Conservative Party. The 32 member board had been planning to ask Conservative Party members at the riding&#x27;s upcoming annual general meeting whether they wanted to hold a nomination contest. The party&#x27;s national council intervened, saying it had already declared Anders as the candidate for the next federal election, and threatened to take control of the annual general meeting of the constituency association. The resignations brought the total number of board members who had resigned over the course of one year to twenty-four.

In 2010, in a card supporting Canadian troops, Anders wrote: &quot;When in doubt, pull the trigger&quot;.

===41st Parliament (2011–2015)===
After the 2011 Canadian election, Anders served as a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, the Industry, Science and Technology Committee and the Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations.

He was removed from his position on Veterans Affairs, partly based on his tendency to fall asleep during meetings. He was reassigned to the House–Senate Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations. In 2011 Anders began to lobby for the government to stop funding the CBC.

Anders&#x27; decision to become involved in the newly formed Wildrose Alliance Party of Alberta has generated controversy, as the Wildrose Alliance Party had hoped to defeat the ruling Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta in the province&#x27;s 2012 election. Ron Liepert, Alberta&#x27;s Minister of Energy, accused Anders of campaigning against him.

In March 2012, Anders was removed from the Veterans Affairs Committee following controversial comments in response to arriving late, texting, and falling asleep at a committee meeting (including calling his accusers NDP &quot;hacks&quot;, and claiming that they praise Vladimir Putin).

In July 2012, Anders opposed his own party and criticized Treasury Board President Tony Clement for funding a visitors&#x27; centre honouring to Norman Bethune, a Canadian physician who died while performing emergency medicine for the Chinese resistance against the Japanese occupation of China. According to Anders, &quot;You don&#x27;t need taxpayer money to go ahead and memorialize somebody who was a fan of the biggest killer in human history [Mao Zedong]&quot;, referring to Bethune&#x27;s communist ideals although Bethune had died ten years before Mao took power.

In September and October 2012, fellow Conservative Party members disassociated themselves from Anders&#x27; belief that New Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair &quot;hastened the death&quot; of former NDP leader Jack Layton by encouraging an election while being in questionable health.

In October 2012, Anders attracted some controversy by calling Bill C279, a private member&#x27;s bill that would amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and hate crime section of the Criminal Code to include &quot;gender identity&quot; and &quot;gender expression&quot; as grounds for discrimination, a &quot;bathroom bill&quot;.

On December 6, 2013, Anders spoke out after the death of Nelson Mandela, saying &quot;If you are looking for another perspective you may be interested in the obituary that David Horowitz wrote for the Freedom Center&quot;.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper has indicated his support of Anders, stating that &quot;Rob is a true reformer and a true conservative. He has been a faithful supporter of mine and I am grateful for his work.&quot;

==Nomination challenges==
Before the nomination race he ultimately lost, Anders defeated several high-profile challengers for the local Conservative nomination.

In 1997, despite his relative youthfulness, Anders was already a veteran political organizer, and was able to win a hotly contested nomination in one of the safest Reform ridings in Canada.

In 2000 he defeated MLA Jocelyn Burgener for the Canadian Alliance nomination. Before the 2004 federal election Anders was challenged by future Alberta Premier Allison Redford. Redford&#x27;s campaign was run by Ron Liepert, who would later challenge Anders for the new Calgary Signal Hill constituency.

In 2007 Anders was re-nominated by the Conservative party without a challenger. This led to a court challenge, which initially rescinded the decision and called for a new nomination. This decision was overturned on appeal, and Anders was the candidate in the 2008 Canadian Federal Election.

In 2010 Anders was challenged again, but successfully defeated Donna Kennedy-Glans, who was elected an MLA in 2012.

Ahead of the 42nd general election, Anders ran for the Conservative nomination in Calgary Signal Hill, essentially a reconfigured version of Calgary West. However, he was defeated by former provincial cabinet minister Ron Liepert. Anders had characterized the nomination contest as a fight for the party&#x27;s soul. He was rebuked by the party for making misleading phone calls that left the impression they were coming from Liepert&#x27;s campaign.

After losing the nomination race for Calgary Signal Hill, Anders decided to contest for the nomination in the new electoral district of Bow River, a mostly rural riding east of Calgary. Anders moved into the district in order to present himself as a resident of the district but he faced a challenge from the mayor of the City of Brooks, Martin Shields; former Rocky View County reeve Rolly Ashdown; and an economics professor from Calgary&#x27;s Mount Royal University, Gerard Lucyshyn. All have been long-time residents of the district.

On September 20, 2014, Anders lost the nomination for Bow River to Shields. His entry in the race for Bow River caused resentment amongst the other candidates who felt that Anders had parachuted into the riding after losing the nomination race in Calgary Signal Hill.

==Post-parliamentary life==
Anders serves as president of Firearms Institute for Rational Education. In 2016, he traveled to Arizona to support the campaign to elect Donald Trump as President of the United States.

==Provincial politics==
At the provincial level, Anders is a member of the Wildrose Party in Alberta and publicly renewed his membership in the wake of the December 2014 defection of 9 of its MLAs, including party leader Danielle Smith, to the governing Progressive Conservatives. Anders expressed interest in running in the Wildrose party&#x27;s leadership election to choose a successor to Smith after she crossed the floor to join the ruling Progressive Conservatives, however, on January 23, 2015, the Wildrose executive announced that Anders was not qualified to run as he did not meet the minimum 6 month membership requirement and that the party would not be issuing a waiver to permit him to be a candidate.

Since 2022, Anders has served on the Board of Governors of the Wildrose Independence Party as a Governor at Large.

In May 2023, Anders was involved in the creation of a new political party, the Solidarity Movement of Alberta.

==Alleged tax evasion==
In 2020, the &quot;National Post&quot; reported that Anders had been charged by the Canada Revenue Agency for tax evasion. Most of the five charges that were laid dated to the period of 1997 to 2015, when he was a member of parliament. Anders was scheduled to face trial on tax evasion charges on October 25, 2021. On June 6, 2022, the CBC reported that all tax evasion charges against Rob Anders had been stayed.

==Electoral record==
Anders has faced high-profile opponents. In 1997 he defeated Dave Bronconnier, who later became the Mayor of Calgary. In 2000 he defeated Jim Silye, a former Reform MP who was now running for the PCs.

























==Activism==
Anders has devoted his time to a variety of conservative causes. Some of these include lobby groups and think tanks such as Focus on the Family, the Canada Family Action Coalition, and to several causes opposing the Government of China&#x27;s policies regarding Tibet and Falun Gong. Before being elected he worked for the Republican Party on the 1994 Senate campaign of Jim Inhofe in Oklahoma as a professional heckler, which earned him the label of &quot;a foreign political saboteur&quot; from CNN.

<doc id="383854" wikidata="Q180502" url="?curid=383854" title="Parasitology">
<text>Parasitology is the study of parasites, their hosts, and the relationship between them. As a biological discipline, the scope of parasitology is not determined by the organism or environment in question but by their way of life. This means it forms a synthesis of other disciplines, and draws on techniques from fields such as cell biology, bioinformatics, biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology, genetics, evolution and ecology.

==Fields==
The study of these diverse organisms means that the subject is often broken up into simpler, more focused units, which use common techniques, even if they are not studying the same organisms or diseases. Much research in parasitology falls somewhere between two or more of these definitions. In general, the study of prokaryotes falls under the field of bacteriology rather than parasitology.

===Medical===

The parasitologist F. E. G. Cox noted that &quot;Humans are hosts to nearly 300 species of parasitic worms and over 70 species of protozoa, some derived from our primate ancestors and some acquired from the animals we have domesticated or come in contact with during our relatively short history on Earth&quot;.

One of the largest fields in parasitology, medical parasitology is the subject that deals with the parasites that infect humans, the diseases caused by them, clinical picture and the response generated by humans against them. It is also concerned with the various methods of their diagnosis, treatment and finally their prevention &amp; control.
A parasite is an organism that live on or within another organism called the host.
These include organisms such as:
* &quot;Plasmodium&quot; spp., the protozoan parasite which causes malaria. The six species infective to humans are &quot;P. falciparum&quot;, &quot;P. malariae&quot;, &quot;P. vivax&quot;, &quot;P. ovale wallikeri&quot;, &quot;P. ovale curtisi&quot;, and &quot;P. knowlesi&quot;.
* &quot;Leishmania&quot;, unicellular organisms which cause leishmaniasis
* &quot;Entamoeba&quot; and &quot;Giardia&quot;, which cause intestinal infections (dysentery and diarrhoea)
* Multicellular organisms and intestinal worms (helminths) such as &quot;Schistosoma&quot; spp., &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot;, &quot;Necator americanus&quot; (hookworm) and &quot;Taenia&quot; spp. (tapeworm)
* Ectoparasites such as ticks, scabies and lice

Medical parasitology can involve drug development, epidemiological studies and study of zoonoses.

===Veterinary===
The study of parasites that cause economic losses in agriculture or aquaculture operations, or which infect companion animals. Examples of species studied are:
* &quot;Lucilia sericata&quot;, a blowfly, which lays eggs on the skins of farm animals. The maggots hatch and burrow into the flesh, distressing the animal and causing economic loss to the farmer
* &quot;Otodectes cynotis&quot;, the cat ear mite, responsible for Canker.
* &quot;Gyrodactylus salaris&quot;, a monogenean parasite of salmon, which can wipe out populations which are not resistant.

===Structural===
This is the study of structures of proteins from parasites. Determination of parasitic protein structures may help to better understand how these proteins function differently from homologous proteins in humans. In addition, protein structures may inform the process of drug discovery.

===Quantitative===
Parasites exhibit an aggregated distribution among host individuals, thus the majority of parasites live in the minority of hosts. This feature forces parasitologists to use advanced biostatistical methodologies.

===Parasite ecology===
Parasites can provide information about host population ecology. In fisheries biology, for example, parasite communities can be used to distinguish distinct populations of the same fish species co-inhabiting a region. Additionally, parasites possess a variety of specialized traits and life-history strategies that enable them to colonize hosts. Understanding these aspects of parasite ecology, of interest in their own right, can illuminate parasite-avoidance strategies employed by hosts.

===Conservation biology of parasites===
Conservation biology is concerned with the protection and preservation of vulnerable species, including parasites. A large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction, partly due to efforts to eradicate parasites which infect humans or domestic animals, or damage human economy, but also caused by the decline or fragmentation of host populations and the extinction of host species.

===Taxonomy and phylogenetics===

The huge diversity between parasitic organisms creates a challenge for biologists who wish to describe and catalogue them. Recent developments in using DNA to identify separate species and to investigate the relationship between groups at various taxonomic scales has been enormously useful to parasitologists, as many parasites are highly degenerate, disguising relationships between species.

== History ==

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek observed and illustrated &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot; in 1681, and linked it to &quot;his own loose stools&quot;. This was the first protozoan parasite of humans that he recorded, and the first to be seen under a microscope.

A few years later, in 1687, the Italian biologists Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo and Diacinto Cestoni published that scabies is caused by the parasitic mite &quot;Sarcoptes scabiei&quot;, marking scabies as the first disease of humans with a known microscopic causative agent. In the same publication, &quot;Esperienze Intorno alla Generazione degl&#x27;Insetti&quot; (&quot;Experiences of the Generation of Insects&quot;), Francesco Redi also described ecto- and endoparasites, illustrating ticks, the larvae of nasal flies of deer, and sheep liver fluke. His earlier (1684) book &quot;Osservazioni intorno agli animali viventi che si trovano negli animali viventi&quot; (&quot;Observations on Living Animals found in Living Animals&quot;) described and illustrated over 100 parasites including the human roundworm. He noted that parasites develop from eggs, contradicting the theory of spontaneous generation.

Modern parasitology developed in the 19th century with accurate observations by several researchers and clinicians. In 1828, James Annersley described amoebiasis, protozoal infections of the intestines and the liver, though the pathogen, &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, was not discovered until 1873 by Friedrich Lösch. James Paget discovered the intestinal nematode &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot; in humans in 1835. James McConnell described the human liver fluke in 1875. A physician at the French naval hospital at Toulon, Louis Alexis Normand, in 1876 researching the ailments of French soldiers returning from what is now Vietnam, discovered the only known helminth that, without treatment, is capable of indefinitely reproducing within a host and causes the disease strongyloidiasis. Patrick Manson discovered the life cycle of elephantiasis, caused by nematode worms transmitted by mosquitoes, in 1877. Manson further predicted that the malaria parasite, &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, had a mosquito vector, and persuaded Ronald Ross to investigate. Ross confirmed that the prediction was correct in 1897–1898. At the same time, Giovanni Battista Grassi and others described the malaria parasite&#x27;s life cycle stages in &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquitoes. Ross was controversially awarded the 1902 Nobel prize for his work, while Grassi was not.

<text>FIELDATA (also written as Fieldata) was a pioneering computer project run by the US Army Signal Corps in the late 1950s that intended to create a single standard (as defined in &quot;MIL-STD-188A/B/C&quot;) for collecting and distributing battlefield information. In this respect it could be thought of as a generalization of the US Air Force&#x27;s SAGE system that was being created at about the same time.

Unlike SAGE, FIELDATA was intended to be much larger in scope, allowing information to be gathered from any number of sources and forms. Much of the FIELDATA system was the specifications for the format the data would take, leading to a character set that would be a huge influence on ASCII a few years later. FIELDATA also specified the message formats and even the electrical standards for connecting FIELDATA-standard machines together.

Another part of the FIELDATA project was the design and construction of computers at several different scales, from data-input terminals at one end, to theatre-wide data processing centers at the other. Several FIELDATA-standard computers were built during the lifetime of the project, including the transportable MOBIDIC from Sylvania, and the BASICPAC and LOGICPAC from Philco. Another system, ARTOC, was intended to provide graphical output (in the form of photographic slides), but was never completed.

Because FIELDATA did not specify codes for interconnection and data transmission control, different systems (like &quot;&quot;STANDARD FORM&quot;, &quot;COMLOGNET Common language code&quot;, &quot;SACCOMNET (465L) Control Code&quot;&quot;) used different control functions. Intercommunication between them was difficult.

FIELDATA is the original character set used internally in UNIVAC computers of the 1100 series, each six-bit character contained in six sequential bits of the 36-bit word of that computer. The direct successor to the UNIVAC 1100 is the Unisys 2200 series computers, which used FIELDATA (although ASCII is now also common with each character encoded in 1/4 of a word, or 9 bits). Because some of the FIELDATA characters are not represented in ASCII, the Unisys 2200 uses &#x27;^&#x27;, &#x27;&quot;&#x27; and &#x27;_&#x27; characters for codes 004oct, 076oct and 077oct respectively.

The FIELDATA project ran from 1956 until it was stopped during a reorganization in 1962.

==FIELDATA characters==

===Military version===
The following table is representative of a reference version of the military set, as described in . Various other variants exist, with in some cases dramatic differences in the supervisory code (the first four rows 0–3). The letters in the first two rows are intended for use in &quot;alphabetic supervisory information&quot;.

<text>David A. Anderson, (born August 16, 1937) is a former Canadian cabinet minister.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Victoria, British Columbia. He was educated at Victoria College, Aiglon College and at the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law; he graduated in 1962 with a LLB. During his UBC days Anderson won a silver medal for rowing in the 1960 Olympic Games, and a silver medal in the Pan American Games in Chicago in 1959. He was also a pilot in the University Reserve of the Royal Canadian Air Force.

==Career==
===Civil servant===
Anderson served as a foreign service officer in the Department of External Affairs between 1962 and 1968. His posts included Indochina (International Supervisory And Truce Commissions) 1963–64, Assistant Canadian Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong, 1964–1967, and China Desk Officer in Ottawa 1967–68. In Hong Kong, Anderson attended the Institute of Oriental Studies of the University of Hong Kong and obtained the British Foreign Officer Higher Standard Certificate in Mandarin.

===Member of Parliament===
He was elected Liberal MP for the constituency of Esquimalt—Saanich on Vancouver Island in the 1968 federal election. Four years later he switched to provincial politics, and was elected leader of the provincial Liberal Party (April 1972), then the third party in the provincial legislature with 5 out of 55 seats.

===Member of the Legislative Assembly===
Although elected himself in the 1972 election, representing the constituency of Victoria, the Liberal Party did not increase its seat total. Anderson served as Member of the Legislative Assembly until his defeat in December 1975.

During this period of elected office Anderson was prominent in representing Canadian concerns over offshore oil drilling, pipeline developments in Northern Canada, and oil tanker traffic between Alaska and the Lower 48 states.

===Academia===
Between 1976 and 1984, Anderson worked as an environmental consultant and adjunct professor at the University of Victoria&#x27;s School of Administration, where he taught in the fields of constitutional and administrative law, and environmental policy. His environmental work focused on coastal and wetland protection and marine pollution from oil exploration and transportation.

Anderson was appointed as a member of the Immigration Appeal Board for a 10-year term in 1984. He served from March 1, 1984, until December 31, 1988, when the board was dissolved.

===Member of Parliament===
In the 1993 federal general election to the 35th Canadian Parliament Anderson re-entered elected politics. He was elected MP for Victoria and retained this position for three subsequent elections, ending when he retired from politics in January 2006. During this period, he served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien as Minister of National Revenue (1993–95), Minister of Transport (1995–97), Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (1997–99) and Minister of the Environment (1999-2006). He also was appointed the regional political minister for British Columbia, which he retained until 2002.

Anderson&#x27;s time in the fisheries portfolio was marked by considerable controversy with the commercial fishing industry as he worked for strict conservation measures to protect fish stocks. These measures included a complete ban on the killing of Coho salmon. After six years of previous failures, he succeeded in getting an agreement with the United States under the Pacific Salmon Treaty to conserve salmon stocks and to end the destructive competitive fishing by the US and Canadian commercial fleets.

In the cabinet shuffle of 1999 midway through the 36th Canadian Parliament, Chrétien appointed Anderson Environment Minister. He served in that post for the following five years, making him the longest serving Canadian environment minister. In this period Anderson&#x27;s work largely centered on the Rio Summit conventions on biodiversity and climate change.

Anderson implemented the &quot;Government of Canada Action Plan 2000 on Climate Change&quot; in tandem with Paul Martin&#x27;s 2000 Canadian federal budget.

Anderson retained his seat in the 37th Canadian Parliament and was successful in getting the Species at Risk Act passed by Parliament and signed into law (2004). and, despite strong objections from the governments of Saskatchewan, Alberta and Ontario and the federal Official Opposition, in securing Canadian ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in December 2002. Other initiatives involved improving air and water quality and established improved federal provincial cooperation on environmental issues.

In international work, Anderson was the first Canadian elected as president of the governing council of the United Nations Environment Programme, a post he held for two years. He took a prominent part in the G8 and OECD Environment Minister&#x27;s meetings. Anderson was dropped from cabinet by Prime Minister Paul Martin in 2004 and did not run in the 2006 election.

===Retirement from politics===
In February 2007, he was named director of the Guelph Institute for the Environment, from which he retired in 2010.

==Awards==
Anderson has received a number of environmental awards, including the John Fraser Award for Environmental Achievement from the Sierra Club of Canada (2005), the Dr. Andrew Thompson Award from West Coast Environmental Law for his lifetime contributions to the environment and sustainability in British Columbia (2004), and the 50th anniversary International Conservation Award (1998) from the Atlantic Salmon Federation.

He was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in laws by the University of Victoria in 2007, and an honorary doctorate of science from Wilfrid Laurier University in 2009. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2010 and named to the Order of British Columbia in 2018.

==Family==
Anderson is married with two children.

<text>Joseph Charles John Piscopo ( ; born June 17, 1951) is an American actor, comedian and conservative radio talk show host. He was a cast member on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1980 to 1984, where he played a variety of recurring characters. His film roles include Danny Vermin in &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; (1984), Moe Dickstein in &quot;Wise Guys&quot; (1986), Doug Bigelow in &quot;Dead Heat&quot; (1988) and Kelly Stone in &quot;Sidekicks&quot; (1992).

== Early life ==
Piscopo was born in Passaic, New Jersey, and grew up in North Caldwell. He attended West Essex High School and was a member of the drama club &quot;The Masquers.&quot; He developed a reputation for never playing a part the way it was written. After graduating in 1969, Piscopo attended Jones College in Jacksonville, Florida, where he received a degree in broadcast management.

== &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ==
In the summer of 1980, Piscopo was hired as a contract player for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The show had gone through a major upheaval when all the writers, major producers, and cast members left that spring. The new cast bombed with critics and fans with the exception of Piscopo and Eddie Murphy. As a result, they were the only two cast members to be kept when Dick Ebersol took over the show the following spring. With the success of &quot;SNL&quot;, Piscopo moved to the wealthy borough of Alpine, New Jersey.

Piscopo is best known for his impressions of celebrities, including Frank Sinatra. Piscopo rewrote the lyrics for a Sinatra sketch with the help of Sinatra lyricist Sammy Cahn and recalled that, &quot;by the grace of God, the old man loved it.&quot; Piscopo later reprised his role as Sinatra in a series of stop-motion animated ads for Lipton Brisk Iced Tea. He had an occasional spot on the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment as a bombastic sports commentator who would pose a series of questions and usually follow them up with a loud, &quot;Who cares?&quot;. Piscopo and Robin Duke also played The Whiners.

== Post-&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; career ==
Piscopo left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the end of the 1983–1984 season. In 1984, he starred with Michael Keaton in the movie &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot;, which was met with mixed reviews. He also starred in an HBO special and wrote a book for Pocket Books titled &quot;The Piscopo Tapes&quot;. An album, &quot;New Jersey&quot;, for Columbia Records, followed in 1985 and an ABC special titled &quot;The Joe Piscopo New Jersey Special&quot; in May 1986. In 1987, Piscopo was mentioned in the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers single &quot;Jammin&#x27; Me&quot;.

In the mid-to-late 1980s, Piscopo developed an interest in bodybuilding. He first became involved with it when he was doing impressions of Bruce Springsteen on &quot;SNL&quot;. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Muscle &amp; Fitness&quot; magazine in April 1988 and again in June 1990. In the 1990 issue, he said, &quot;Some people in Hollywood think I&#x27;m nuts with this bodybuilding stuff. They&#x27;ll say, &#x27;You&#x27;re getting too big. You&#x27;ll hurt your career.&#x27; But they don&#x27;t understand that high that comes from a workout, the challenge, and the personal victory.&quot;

Since January 2014, Piscopo has hosted &quot;Piscopo in the Morning&quot;, a radio show from 6:00 am to 10:00am weekdays on 970AM The Answer in New York City. From the inception of his radio program until June 2020, Piscopo&#x27;s program was produced by Frank Morano, who also served as an on-air contributor. Starting on December 13, 2020, Piscopo also began to host the Ramsey Mazda Sunday Nights with Sinatra on 770 AM WABC in New York and WABC&#x27;s sister station 107.1 FM WLIR in Hampton Bays.

Piscopo considered running as an independent for governor of New Jersey in 2017 based in part on the political success of Donald Trump, for whom he campaigned in 2016. He was encouraged by a number of political figures, including former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. However, in May 2017, he ultimately decided not to run. Piscopo has been active in a band and performed stand up and music at a political rally hosted by businessman Mike Lindell in May 2021.

==Personal life==
In 1973, Piscopo married Nancy Jones. They had one child and divorced in 1988. In 1997, he married Kimberly Driscoll, who was his son&#x27;s nanny when Piscopo was married to Jones. They had three children and divorced in 2006.

Piscopo is a resident of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, and has also lived in Tewksbury Township, New Jersey.

Piscopo is an avid New Jersey Devils fan and was the emcee for the team&#x27;s 2003 Stanley Cup championship celebration.

Piscopo was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1990.

==Awards==
In 2013, Piscopo was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

<text>Sarkis Assadourian (born January 25, 1948) is a Canadian politician from the Liberal Party of Canada. He became the first Armenian-Canadian to be elected to the House of Commons, with great support of the Armenian community of Toronto.

==Background==
Assadourian was born in Aleppo, Syria. His family emigrated soon after. He studied painting at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. In 1970 he moved to Toronto where he worked as a property manager. He also worked as a consultant on multiculturalism for both the provincial and federal governments.

Assadourian and his wife Zaza have four children. He remains a supporter of Armenian causes and is an active member of the Richmond Hill Provincial Liberal Association.

==Politics==
In 1988, Assadourian entered politics as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Don Valley North. He won the Liberal nomination over rival Sarmite Bulte. During the campaign debate he said that he wanted, &quot;honest and open government, for a change.&quot; The New Democratic Party candidate, Anton Kuerti reminded him that the Tories were elected in 1984 criticising the Liberals on the same issue. Assadourian stated that he was staunchly against abortion which was a hot button issue during the campaign. He lost the election to Conservative candidate Barbara Greene by 604 votes.

In 1993 he ran again and this time won against Greene by 14,054 votes in what was a general rout of the Conservatives in Toronto and nationwide. In 1997, Assadourian moved seats to Brampton Centre. In 2003, he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. He did not run in the 2004 election.

Assadourian ran in the 2010 Richmond Hill Municipal Elections in Ward 3. He placed fifth out of seven candidates. He ran again in 2022 in Ward 5, placing eighth out of 10 candidates.

==After politics==
He now serves as a Citizenship Judge in Toronto.

<doc id="383876" wikidata="Q21447237" url="?curid=383876" title="Thermoproteota">
<text>The Thermoproteota are prokaryotes that have been classified as a phylum of the domain Archaea. Initially, the Thermoproteota were thought to be sulfur-dependent extremophiles but recent studies have identified characteristic Thermoproteota environmental rRNA indicating the organisms may be the most abundant archaea in the marine environment. Originally, they were separated from the other archaea based on rRNA sequences; other physiological features, such as lack of histones, have supported this division, although some crenarchaea were found to have histones. Until 2005 all cultured Thermoproteota had been thermophilic or hyperthermophilic organisms, some of which have the ability to grow at up to 113 °C. These organisms stain Gram negative and are morphologically diverse, having rod, cocci, filamentous and oddly-shaped cells. Recent evidence shows that some members of the Thermoproteota are methanogens.

Thermoproteota were initially classified as a part of regnum Eocyta in 1984, but this classification has been discarded. The term &quot;eocyte&quot; now applies to either TACK (formerly Crenarchaeota) or to Thermoproteota.

==&quot;Sulfolobus&quot;==
One of the best characterized members of the Crenarchaeota is &quot;Sulfolobus solfataricus&quot;. This organism was originally isolated from geothermally heated sulfuric springs in Italy, and grows at 80 °C and pH of 2–4. Since its initial characterization by Wolfram Zillig, a pioneer in thermophile and archaean research, similar species in the same genus have been found around the world. Unlike the vast majority of cultured thermophiles, &quot;Sulfolobus&quot; grows aerobically and chemoorganotrophically (gaining its energy from organic sources such as sugars). These factors allow a much easier growth under laboratory conditions than anaerobic organisms and have led to &quot;Sulfolobus&quot; becoming a model organism for the study of hyperthermophiles and a large group of diverse viruses that replicate within them. 

==Recombinational repair of DNA damage==
Irradiation of &quot;S. solfataricus&quot; cells with ultraviolet light strongly induces formation of type IV pili that can then promote cellular aggregation. Ultraviolet light-induced cellular aggregation was shown by Ajon et al. to mediate high frequency inter-cellular chromosome marker exchange. Cultures that were ultraviolet light-induced had recombination rates exceeding those of uninduced cultures by as much as three orders of magnitude. &quot;S. solfataricus&quot; cells are only able to aggregate with other members of their own species. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. considered that the ultraviolet light-inducible DNA transfer process, followed by homologous recombinational repair of damaged DNA, is an important mechanism for promoting chromosome integrity.

This DNA transfer process can be regarded as a primitive form of sexual interaction.

==Marine species==
Beginning in 1992, data were published that reported sequences of genes belonging to the Thermoproteota in marine environments., Since then, analysis of the abundant lipids from the membranes of Thermoproteota taken from the open ocean have been used to determine the concentration of these “low temperature Crenarchaea” (See TEX-86). Based on these measurements of their signature lipids, Thermoproteota are thought to be very abundant and one of the main contributors to the fixation of carbon . DNA sequences from Thermoproteota have also been found in soil and freshwater environments, suggesting that this phylum is ubiquitous to most environments.

In 2005, evidence of the first cultured “low temperature Crenarchaea” was published. Named &quot;Nitrosopumilus maritimus&quot;, it is an ammonia-oxidizing organism isolated from a marine aquarium tank and grown at 28 °C.

== Possible connections with eukaryotes ==

The research about two-domain system of classification has paved the possibilities of connections between crenarchaea and eukaryotes.

DNA analysis from 2008 (and later, 2017) has shown that eukaryotes possible evolved from thermoproteota-like organisms. Other candidates for the ancestor of eukaryotes include closely related asgards. This could suggest that eukaryotic organisms possibly evolved from prokaryotes.

These results are similar to the eocyte hypothesis of 1984, proposed by James A. Lake. The classification according to Lake, states that both crenarchaea and asgards belong to Kingdom Eocyta. Though this has been discarded by scientists, the main concept remains. The term &quot;Eocyta&quot; now either refers to the TACK group or to Phylum Thermoproteota itself.

However, the topic is highly debated and research is still going on.

<text>Maurice Rose (November 26, 1899 – March 30, 1945) was a career officer in the United States Army who attained the rank of major general. A veteran of World War I and World War II, Rose was commanding the 3rd Armored Division when he was killed in action in Germany during the closing days of the Second World War becoming the highest-ranking American killed by enemy fire during the war in Europe.

Rose was the son and grandson of rabbis from Poland, at the time of his death he was the highest-ranking Jewish person in the U.S. Army. He was not especially religious, did not publicize his faith, and claimed in his Army records to be Protestant. Rose was married twice and had two sons.

The 3rd Armored Division&#x27;s official history of World War II memorialized Rose by stating &quot;He was over six feet tall, erect, dark haired, and had finely chiseled features. He was firm and prompt of decision, brooking no interference by man, events or conditions in order to destroy the enemy.&quot;

==Early life==
Rose was born in Middletown, Connecticut on November 26, 1899, the son of Rabbi Samuel Rose and Katherin &quot;Katy&quot; (Bronowitz) Rose. In 1902, the Rose family relocated to Denver, Colorado, where Rose was raised and educated. He attended East High School, where he was editor of the school newspaper and graduated with honors in 1916. His desire for a military career became well known among his classmates; in the school yearbook, a cartoon illustrating the newspaper staff depicted him carrying a rifle.

Rose lied about his age to enlist in the Colorado National Guard as a private after graduating from high school, hoping to serve in the Pancho Villa Expedition. However, he was discharged six weeks later when his commander was informed that he was underage.

Rose was raised in a Jewish household; his father was a businessman who operated a dress design shop with Rose&#x27;s mother and later became a rabbi. Rose had a bar mitzvah and could speak Yiddish and read Hebrew. Though brought up Jewish, and identified as Jewish in post-World War I newspaper articles that recorded the bravery of Jewish U.S. Army soldiers, he began to identify himself as Protestant in military records soon afterwards. Biographers and researchers believe he could have undergone a religious conversion, though there are no records to substantiate this. Instead, they believe it is more likely that Rose was not especially religious as an adult, and claimed Protestantism in his military records as a way to assimilate with his peers and increase his chances for advancement as his career progressed. Rose&#x27;s grave marker is a Christian cross, but Rose is still regarded as a significant figure in U.S. Jewish history.

==Military career==
===World War I===
Rose worked for a year in a meatpacking plant where one of his brothers was employed, and enlisted again in 1917 after he obtained his parents&#x27; permission. Rose was soon selected for officer training, and falsely claimed to have been born in 1895 so that he would appear to meet the minimum required age of twenty-one. After graduating from Officer Candidate School (OCS) at Fort Riley, Kansas in August 1917, Rose was commissioned as a Reserve second lieutenant of Infantry.

With American entry into World War I having occurred in April 1917, after receiving his commission, Rose was assigned to command a platoon in the 353rd Infantry Regiment, a unit of the 89th Division. The division was organized and trained at Camp Funston to prepare for service in France, and in December 1917 he was promoted to temporary first lieutenant. In May 1918, the division traveled by train to Camp Mills, New York, and it departed for Europe by ship in June. Later that month, the 89th Division arrived in Liverpool, England and a week later they arrived in France.

The 89th Division completed additional training until August, when it relieved the 82nd Division in the Lucey sector, near the city of Toul. Rose&#x27;s battalion of the 353rd Infantry took up defensive positions near Metz, where they began preparations to participate in the Meuse–Argonne offensive. Rose took part in combat throughout the offensive, and was wounded at St. Mihiel, including being hit by shrapnel during a German mortar and artillery barrage, as well as sustaining a concussion. He initially refused to be evacuated, but he collapsed from exhaustion. Medics removed him from the battlefield, and he was taken to the 89th Division&#x27;s hospital near the village of Flirey.

After a few days of convalescence, Rose left the hospital against medical advice and returned to his unit. With medical officials unsure of his whereabouts, the Army reported to Rose&#x27;s parents that he been killed, an error which took several days to correct. Rose continued to serve with the 353rd Infantry until the war ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918. He remained in Germany as part of the Army of Occupation, and was discharged in June 1919.

===Inter War period===
After leaving the Army, Rose accepted a position as a traveling salesman with Hendrie &amp; Bolthoff, makers of mining and manufacturing equipment and supplies. His territory included Utah, and he rented a room in Salt Lake City. During a visit to the post quartermaster at nearby Fort Douglas, Rose learned that while the army carried out a post-war reorganization, it was accepting a limited number of lieutenants and captains for return to active duty.

On July 1, 1920, Rose re-joined the peacetime army as a second lieutenant, which was then adjusted to first lieutenant in recognition of his wartime rank. On the following day, he was promoted to captain. Rose served initially with the 20th, 21st, 53rd and 38th Infantry Regiments at Fort Douglas. In 1924, he was the adjutant of the 38th Infantry. While stationed at Fort Douglas, his duties included organizing and overseeing annual Citizens Military Training Camps, which were designed to expose young men without military service to the experiences of Army life.

In 1927, Rose was assigned to Kansas State University as a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps instructor, and his additional duties included coaching rifle marksmanship for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. In 1931 and 1932, he was serving with the 8th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Bliss, Texas. In the summer of 1932, Rose was one of the Army officers assigned to provide instruction at the annual training encampment of the New Mexico National Guard. Rose was assigned to duty as adjutant of the Corozal Military Post on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal Zone beginning in February 1933. He served with the 6th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, from August 1935 to August 1936.

Rose was promoted to major in 1936. From 1937 to 1939 he was an observer and advisor for the Pennsylvania National Guard. In 1939 Rose was posted to Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, as an instructor at the Third Corps Area Command and Staff School.

In addition to his completion of Officer Candidate School in 1917, Rose graduated from the Infantry Company Officer Course (1926) and the Cavalry Officer Course (1931). He was a 1937 graduate of the Command and General Staff College, and he graduated from the Army Industrial College in 1940.

===World War II===

From July 1940 to July 1941 Rose was assigned to Fort Knox, Kentucky and commanded 3rd Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment as a lieutenant colonel. In 1941, he was assigned as executive officer of 1st Armored Brigade, a unit of the newly-organized 1st Armored Division. After observing the brigade in action, newspaper reporter Keyes Beech referred to Rose as &quot;probably the best looking man in the army.&quot;

In early 1942, Rose was chief of staff for the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Benning, Georgia. He continued as chief of staff after the division arrived in North Africa and was promoted to colonel. When German forces in Tunisia were reduced to combat ineffectiveness, Rose negotiated with their commander, Fritz Krause, on the details of their unconditional surrender.

Promoted to brigadier general, Rose was assigned to lead Combat Command A, 2nd Armored Division, which he commanded in combat throughout fighting in Sicily. When Leroy H. Watson was relieved as commander of the 3rd Armored Division during combat in France in August 1944, Rose succeeded him and was promoted to major general.

After assuming command of the division, Rose became known for his aggressive style of leadership, directing his units from the front rather than a rear command post. Following the 1944 Allied breakthrough on the French coast, the 3rd Armored Division dashed through Belgium and was the first tank unit to enter Germany, and the first to breach the Siegfried line. 3rd Armored helped stem the German offensive in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge, and was the first armor unit to enter Cologne.

==Death==
On March 30, 1945, Rose was riding with members of his staff at the front of a 3rd Armored column a few miles south of the city of Paderborn in a rural forested area. Receiving reports of units being cut off by German troops, they turned around to investigate, and suddenly began taking small arms, tank, and anti-tank fire. Rose and his staff jumped into a nearby ditch as the tank leading their column took a direct hit and was destroyed. When they realized that they were being surrounded by German tanks of the SS Brigade Westfalen they re-mounted their vehicles and attempted to escape, driving off the road and through a nearby field. As they turned back onto the road they saw it was occupied by more German tanks.

Recognizing that they were about to be cut off, the driver of the lead jeep in Rose&#x27;s party accelerated and narrowly made it past the German tanks. The driver of Rose&#x27;s jeep attempted the same maneuver, but one of the German tanks succeeded in cutting them off. Rose and the other passengers dismounted, and the German tank commander opened his hatch and aimed a machine pistol at them. Rose reached towards his holster, either to surrender his pistol or attempt to fight his way out. The German tank commander then opened fire, with 14 rounds hitting Rose, including several in the head. The other passengers from Rose&#x27;s jeep ran into the woods, hid overnight, and were reunited with friendly units the next morning. They later returned to retrieve Rose&#x27;s body and the documents he was carrying. Rose was buried at Netherlands American Cemetery and Memorial.

===Investigation===
Investigators led by Leon Jaworski later looked into whether Rose&#x27;s death could be considered a war crime, which might have been the case if Rose and his staff were shot while attempting to surrender. The investigation concluded that the German tank crew probably believed Rose intended to fight, and had no idea they had killed a high-ranking commander, because his body and several sensitive documents he was carrying were not removed from his jeep. Rose was the highest-ranking American killed by enemy fire in the European Theater of Operations during the war.

Service: Army Division: 3d Armored Division General Orders: Headquarters, First U.S. Army, General Orders No. 86 (November 25, 1944)

==Personal life==
In 1920, Rose married Venice Hanson (1895–1962) of Salt Lake City. They separated in 1928 or 1929, and divorced in 1931. They were the parents of a son, Maurice &quot;Mike&quot; Rose (1925–2010), a career officer in the United States Marine Corps who attained the rank of colonel and was a veteran of World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In 1934, Rose married Virginia Barringer (1912–1997). They were the parents of a son, Maurice Roderick &quot;Reece&quot; Rose (1941–2020), who spent his career in law enforcement, including service as chief of police for the San Antonio International Airport.

==Legacy==

J. Lawton Collins, Rose&#x27;s superior as commander of the VII Corps, regarded Rose &quot;as the top notch division commander in the business at the time of his death.&quot; However, Rose never gained the prominence of many of his contemporaries, for reasons including the fact that he did not survive the war, and as an intensely private man, he rarely if ever sought personal publicity.

His biographers, Steven L. Ossad and Don R. Marsh, referred to Rose as &quot;World War II&#x27;s Greatest Forgotten Commander&quot;. Andy Rooney, a World War II war correspondent and later &quot;60 Minutes&quot; commentator, wrote in his book &quot;My War&quot;:

Maj. Gen. Maurice Rose, who had been with the Second Armored Division at Saint-Lô, was now the commander of the Third Armored and he may have been the best tank commander of the war. He was a leader down where they fight. Not all great generals were recognized. Maurice Rose was a great one and had a good reputation among the people who knew what was going on, but his name was not in the headlines as Patton&#x27;s so often was. Rose led from the front of his armored division.

Rose&#x27;s birthplace in Middletown, Connecticut is marked with a plaque as part of the city&#x27;s Main Street Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Armed Forces Reserve Center in Middletown is also named for Rose, as is the Connecticut Route 9 bridge over Union Street in Middletown.

Rose Terrace and Rose Hall at Fort Knox were named for Rose. The army transport , the Rose Medical Center in Denver, Colorado, and the primary school in Margraten, Netherlands were named in his honor. In addition, the now-closed Maurice Rose Army Airfield near Frankfurt, Germany and Rose Barracks near Vilseck, Germany were also named for him.

The 1951 film &quot;The Tanks Are Coming&quot; depicts five tanks of the 3rd Armored Division as they advance across France into Germany during World War II. The commanding general of the division is not named, but is presumed to be Rose based on the film&#x27;s timeline and the fact that the character was portrayed by Roy Roberts, an actor who physically resembled Rose.

<text>John Dann MacDonald (July 24, 1916December 28, 1986) was an American writer of novels and short stories. He is known for his thrillers. A prolific author of crime and suspense novels, many set in his adopted home of Florida, he was one of the most successful American novelists of his time, MacDonald sold an estimated 70 million books. His best-known works include the popular and critically acclaimed Travis McGee series and his 1957 novel &quot;The Executioners&quot;, which was filmed twice as &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, once in 1962 and again in 1991.

==Early life==

MacDonald was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, where his father, Eugene Macdonald, worked for the Savage Arms Corporation. The family relocated to Utica, New York in 1926, his father becoming treasurer of the Utica office of Savage Arms. In 1934, MacDonald was given a choice by his father: spend another year in school as a post-graduate, or go to Europe for several weeks. He chose Europe and this began an interest in travel and photography.

After graduating from high school, he enrolled at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, but he quit during his sophomore year. MacDonald worked at menial jobs in New York City, then was admitted to Syracuse University, where he met his future wife, Dorothy Prentiss. They married secretly in Pennsylvania in 1937, and had a public ceremony in Utica later that year. He graduated from Syracuse University the next year. The couple had one son, Maynard.

In 1939, MacDonald received an MBA from Harvard University. MacDonald later used his education in business and economics in crafting his fiction. Several of his novels are either set in the business world or involve shady financial or real estate deals.

In 1940, MacDonald accepted a direct commission as a first lieutenant of the United States Army Ordnance Corps. During World War II, he served in the Office of Strategic Services in the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations; this region featured in many of his earlier short stories and novels. He was discharged in September 1945 as a lieutenant colonel. &quot;Dear Dordo: The World War II Letters of Dorothy and John D. MacDonald&quot; was published by Peppertree Press in 2022.

In 1951 he moved his family from Utica, New York to Florida, eventually settling in Sarasota.

==Writing career==
===Early fiction===
MacDonald&#x27;s first published short story, &quot;G-Robot,&quot; appeared in the July 1936 &quot;Double Action Gang&quot; magazine. Following his 1945 discharge from the army, MacDonald spent four months writing short stories, generating some 800,000 words and losing while typing 14 hours a day, seven days a week. He received hundreds of rejection slips, but &quot;Cash on the Coffin!&quot; appeared in the May 1946 pulp magazine &quot;Detective Tales&quot;. He would eventually sell nearly 500 short stories to various mystery and adventure fiction magazines. Selections from MacDonald&#x27;s early magazine fiction, somewhat revised, were later republished in two collections, &quot;The Good Old Stuff&quot; (1982) and &quot;More Good Old Stuff&quot; (1984), 

Starting with &quot;The Brass Cupcake&quot; in 1950, MacDonald wrote more than forty standalone crime thrillers and domestic dramas, most published as paperback originals and many of them set in Florida. Among them was &quot;The Executioners&quot; (1957), which was filmed twice as &quot;Cape Fear&quot; and later republished under that title. MacDonald also wrote three science fiction novels, including &quot;The Girl, the Gold Watch &amp; Everything&quot; (1962), which was filmed for television. After introducing his series character Travis McGee in 1964, MacDonald concentrated mostly on that series, although he did publish four additional standalone novels.

===Travis McGee===
In 1964, MacDonald published &quot;The Deep Blue Good-by&quot;, the first of 21 novels starring Travis McGee, a self-described &quot;salvage consultant&quot; who recovers stolen property for a fee of 50 percent, and who narrates his adventures in the first person. McGee originally was to be called Dallas McGee, but MacDonald dropped that name after the Kennedy assassination, borrowing instead the name of Travis Air Force Base. The McGee adventures, each of which has a color in the title, mostly play out in Florida (where McGee lives a hedonistic bachelor life on a houseboat), the Caribbean, or Mexico, and many of them feature his friend and sidekick Dr. Meyer (&quot;Just &#x27;Meyer&#x27;, please&quot;) Meyer, a renowned economist who helps Travis deconstruct elaborate swindles and cases of business corruption.

==Death==
Following complications of coronary artery bypass surgery, MacDonald slipped into a coma on December 10, 1986. He died at the age of seventy, on December 28, in St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He is buried in Poland, New York. He was survived by his wife Dorothy (1911–1989) and a son, Maynard.

==Media adaptations==
*MacDonald&#x27;s novel &quot;Soft Touch&quot; was the basis for the 1961 film &quot;Man-Trap&quot;.
*His 1957 novel &quot;The Executioners&quot; was filmed during 1962 as &quot;Cape Fear&quot; featuring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum. Martin Scorsese directed the 1991 remake of &quot;Cape Fear&quot; starring Robert De Niro and Nick Nolte. Because of the success of the films, &quot;The Executioners&quot; has been republished under the &quot;Cape Fear&quot; title, even though the novel is set in Florida and does not mention Cape Fear, North Carolina. 
*His 1963 novel &quot;The Drowner&quot; was adapted as an episode of the television series &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot; entitled &quot;The Deep End,&quot; which aired in January 1964.
*The novel &quot;Cry Hard, Cry Fast&quot; was adapted as a two-part episode of the television series &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; during November 1967.
*A 1970 film adaptation of the novel &quot;Darker Than Amber&quot; was directed by Robert Clouse from a screenplay by MacDonald and Ed Waters. It featured Rod Taylor as series character Travis McGee with Theodore Bikel as his sidekick Meyer. The film earned positive reviews but lost money, causing producer Jack Reeves to abandon his plans to continue the series.
*The novella &quot;Linda&quot; was filmed twice for television, in 1973 (with Stella Stevens in the title role) and in 1993 (with Virginia Madsen).
*&quot;The Girl, the Gold Watch &amp; Everything&quot; was adapted for a 1980 TV film. It resulted in a 1981 sequel, &quot;The Girl, the Gold Watch &amp; Dynamite&quot;.
*The 1980 TV film &quot;Condominium&quot;, based on MacDonald&#x27;s novel, featured Dan Haggerty and Barbara Eden.
*Sam Elliott played Travis McGee in the TV adaptation of &quot;The Empty Copper Sea&quot;, titled &quot;Travis McGee&quot; (1983). It relocated McGee to California, eliminating the Florida locales basic to the novel.
*The 1984 film &quot;A Flash of Green&quot; featured Ed Harris. Victor Nuñez, who wrote the screenplay and directed the film, was nominated for Grand Jury Prize at the 1985 Sundance Film Festival.
*A planned film of &quot;The Deep Blue Good-by&quot; to star Christian Bale as Travis McGee was cancelled by Fox in 2015 after Bale sustained a knee injury. It is not known whether the project will be revived.

==Influence==

Most current Floridian mystery writers acknowledge a debt to MacDonald, including Randy Wayne White, James Hall, Les Standiford, Jonathon King, and Tim Dorsey. In 1972, the Mystery Writers of America bestowed upon MacDonald its highest honor, the Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement and consistent quality. Stephen King praised MacDonald as &quot;the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller.&quot; Kingsley Amis said MacDonald &quot;is by any standards a better writer than Saul Bellow, only MacDonald writes thrillers and Bellow is a human-heart chap, so guess who wears the top-grade laurels.&quot;

In a May 2016 &quot;The New York Times&quot; interview, author Nathaniel Philbrick said: &quot;I recently discovered John D. MacDonald’s Travis McGee series. Every time I finish one of those slender books, I tell myself it’s time to take a break and return to the pile on the night stand but then find myself deep into another McGee novel. Before there were Lee Child and Carl Hiaasen, there was MacDonald — as prescient and verbally precise as anyone writing today can possibly hope to be.&quot;

In the novels, McGee had his lodgings on his houseboat, the &quot;Busted Flush&quot;, docked at Slip F-18, marina Bahia Mar, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In 1987, the Friends of Libraries U.S.A. installed a &quot;literary landmark plaque&quot; around what would be Slip F-18 in Bahia Mar. After the docks were remodeled, the plaque was moved to the Dockmaster&#x27;s office.

Jimmy Buffett wrote and recorded the song &quot;Incommunicado&quot; in 1981 whose 1st verse references both McGee &amp; McDonald, albeit using Cedar Key to rhyme with McGee instead of Bahia Mar.

<doc id="383889" wikidata="Q1175528" url="?curid=383889" title="Nur al-Din">
<text>Nur al-Din () is a male Arabic given name, translating to &quot;light of Faith&quot;, &quot;nūr&quot; meaning &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dīn&quot; meaning &quot;religion&quot;. More recently, the name has also been used as a surname.

There are many Romanized spelling variants of the name. The element نور can be spelled &quot;Nur&quot;, &quot;Noor&quot;, &quot;Nor&quot;, &quot;Nour or Nuer. &quot;The element دين can be spelled either &quot;Din&quot;, &quot;Deen&quot; or &quot;Dine&quot;. The definite article in front of the &quot;sun letter&quot; &quot;d&quot; is realized only as a gemination /dː/, the Arabic pronunciation being /nuːrudːiːn/. 

Syntactically, the name is an &quot;iḍāfah&quot; (genitive construction), in full vocalization &quot;nūru d-dīni&quot;. Consequently, depending on the system of Romanization, the definite article can be rendered as &quot;al&quot;, &quot;ad&quot;, &quot;ud&quot;, &quot;ed&quot; or &quot;d&quot;.

Among the variant romanized spellings in common use are &quot;Nuraddin&quot;, &quot;Nureddin&quot;, &quot;Noureddin&quot;, &quot;Noureddine&quot;, &quot;Nooradeen&quot;, &quot;Nordeen&quot;, &quot;Nourdin&quot;, &quot;Noordine&quot;, &quot;Nordine&quot;, &quot;Nuradin&quot;, &quot;Nurdin&quot;, &quot;Nooruldeen&quot;; scientific transliterations are &quot;Nur ad-Din&quot;, &quot;Nur-ud-Din&quot;, &quot;Nur al-Din&quot;, etc.

<text>On2 TrueMotion VP3 is a (royalty-free) lossy video compression format and video codec. It is an incarnation of the TrueMotion video codec, a series of video codecs developed by On2 Technologies.

There is no formal specification for the VP3 bitstream format beyond the VP3 source code published by On2 Technologies. In 2003, Mike Melanson created an incomplete description of the VP3 bitstream format and decoding process at a higher level than source code, with some help from On2 and the Xiph.Org Foundation.

==History==
VP3 was originally a proprietary and patented video codec.
On2 TrueMotion VP3.1 was introduced in May 2000 followed three months later by the VP3.2 release. Later that year, On2 announced VP3 plugins for QuickTime and RealPlayer. In May 2001, On2 released the beta version of its new VP4 proprietary codec. In June 2001, On2 also released a VP3 codec implementation for Microsoft Windows where the encoder was priced at $39.95 for personal use, and $2,995 for limited commercial use. In August 2001, On2 Technologies announced that they would be releasing an open source version of their VP3.2 video compression algorithm. In September 2001 they published the source code and open source license for VP3.2 video compression algorithm at www.vp3.com. The VP3.2 Public License 0.1 granted the right to modify the source code only if the resulting larger work continued to support playback of VP3.2 data.

===Move to free software===
In September, 2001 it was donated to the public as open source, and On2 irrevocably disclaimed all rights to it, granting a royalty-free license grant for any patent claims it might have over the software and any derivatives, allowing anyone to use any VP3-derived codec for any purpose.
In March 2002, On2 altered licensing terms required to download the source code for VP3 to LGPL.

===Theora===

In June 2002 On2 donated VP3 to the Xiph.org Foundation under a BSD-like open source license to make VP3 the basis of a new, free (e.g. patent- and royalty-free) video codec, Theora.

The free video codec Theora was forked off from the released codebase of VP3.2 and further developed into an independent codec. On2 declared Theora to be the successor in VP3&#x27;s lineage.

Theora developers declared a freeze on the Theora I bitstream format in June 2004, allowing other companies to start implementing encoders and decoders for the format without worrying about the format changing in incompatible ways. The &quot;Theora I Specification&quot; was published in September 2004. Any later changes in the specification are minor updates. A first stable release (version 1.0) of the Theora reference implementation (libtheora) was released in November 2008.

===VP4===
VP4 was announced in January 2001. On2 Technologies released the beta version of VP4 on May 21, 2001. In June 2001 On2 Technologies posted the production release of VP4 on its website. VP4 brought an improved encoder for VP3 bitstream format.
So because of keeping the bitstream format VP4 can&#x27;t be seen as an individual codec.

On July 19, 2001 On2 announced an agreement with RealNetworks to license its VP4 video compression technology, for set-top boxes and other devices. On2 enabled RealPlayer as the exclusive media player for the VP4 codec and the RealSystem iQ architecture became the only streaming media platform capable of delivering the VP4 codec. The first beta version of a plug-in for RealPlayer was announced in January 2002.

Lately AOL licensed VP4 and created the Nullsoft Streaming Video format. Now the VP4 codec is limited, but still used by AOL.

Later incarnations of this codec are VP5, VP6, VP7, VP8, and VP9.

<doc id="383892" wikidata="Q504947" url="?curid=383892" title="Korarchaeota">
<text>The Korarchaeota is a proposed phylum within the Archaea. The name is derived from the Greek noun koros or kore, meaning &quot;young man&quot; or &quot;young woman,&quot; and the Greek adjective archaios which means &quot;ancient.&quot; They are also known as Xenarchaeota. The name is equivalent to &quot;Candidatus&quot; Korarchaeota, and they go by the name Xenarchaeota or Xenarchaea as well.

==Taxonomy==
The Korarchaeota are a proposed phylum in the domain, Archaea. They are thought to have diverged relatively early in the genesis of Archaea and are among the deep-branching lineages. Korarchaeota are also known as Xenarchaeota. Korarchaeaota, along with Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, belong to the superphylum called TACK. The evolutionary link between Asgard archaea and Korarchaeota of TACK (Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, Korarchaeota) is yet unknown.

The first member of Korarchaeota to have its genome reconstructed was &quot;Korarchaeum crypotfilum&quot;, which was found in a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park and described in 2008. Since then only a few Korarchaeal genomes have been described. To check for Korarchaeota, samples from a variety of hot springs in Iceland and Kamchatka were gathered. According to the samples and analysis, the Icelandic samples contained about 87 distinct 16S ribosomal nucleic acid sequences, whereas the Kamchatkan samples contained about 33.

Based on protein sequences and phylogenetic analysis of conserved single genes, the Korarchaeote was identified as a “deep archaeal lineage” with a possible relationship to the Crenarchaeota. Furthermore, given the known genetic makeup of archaea, the Korarchaeota may have preserved a set of biological traits that correspond to the earliest known archaeal form.

Analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences suggests that they are a deeply branching lineage that does not belong to the main archaeal groups, Thermoproteota and Euryarchaeota. Analysis of the genome of one korarchaeote that was enriched from a mixed culture revealed a number of both Crenarchaeota- and Euryarchaeota-like features and supports the hypothesis of a deep-branching ancestry.

===Species===
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

Listed below are the known species of Korarcheota Candidatus Korarchaeota

A strain of &quot;Korarchaeum cryptofilum&quot; was cultivated from an enrichment culture from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, USA and described in 2008. The cells are long and needle-shaped, which gave the species its name, alluding to its &quot;cryptical filaments&quot;. This organism lacks the genes for purine nucleotide biosynthesis and thus relies on environmental sources to meet its purine requirements.

== Characteristics ==
Korarchaeota are a proposed phylum within the domain, Archaea, and therefore exhibit characteristics such as having a cell wall without peptidoglycan, as well as lipid membranes that are ether-linked. They have a surface layer of paracrystalline protein. This surface layer, known as the S-layer, is densely packed and consists of 1-2 proteins form various lattice structures and are most likely what maintains the cells’ structural integrity. They are typically rod-shaped, however, it has been found that this morphology can change to be thicker-shaped in the presence of higher sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) concentrations. Korarchaeota cells have an ultrathin filamentous morphology that may vary in length. They typically average 15 μm in length and 0.16 μm in diameter but can be seen up to 100 μm long. Some Archaea can fix carbon dioxide through the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway into organic compounds

==Ecology==
Korarcheota have only been found in hydrothermal environments ranging from terrestrial, including hot springs to marine, including shallow hydrothermal vents and deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Previous research has shown greater diversity of Korarchaea found in terrestrial hot springs compared to marine environments. Korarchaeota have been found in nature in only low abundances. Korarcheota likely originated in marine environments and then adapted to terrestrial ones.

Geographically, Korarcheota have been found in a variety of locations around the world including Japan, Yellowstone National Park, the Gulf of California, Iceland and Russia.

Korarchaeota are thermophiles, having been found living in conditions of up to 128 degrees Celsius. The lowest temperature they have been found in is 52 degrees Celsius. While they have frequently been observed living in acidic conditions, they have also been found living in conditions up to a pH of 10.

Researchers have identified a virus that can potentially infect Korarcheota.

<text>Cyan, Inc., also known as Cyan Worlds, Inc., is an American video game developer and publisher based in Mead, Washington. Founded as Cyan Productions by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller in 1987, the company created the &quot;Myst&quot; series.

&quot;Myst&quot; became the best-selling PC game ever made when it was released in 1993, and remained so for several years afterwards. It spawned several sequels, including &quot;Riven&quot; and the massively multiplayer online adventure &quot;Myst Online: Uru Live&quot;. Before &quot;Myst&quot;, the company created children&#x27;s games such as &quot;The Manhole&quot;. In 2016, they released the Kickstarter-funded game &quot;Obduction&quot; and in 2023, they released &quot;Firmament&quot;, also funded with Kickstarter.

As of 2024, Cyan is the oldest surviving independent game studio in the United States. 

==History==

===Pre-&quot;Myst&quot; (1987–1992)===
Cyan was founded in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, operating out of their parents&#x27; basement in their Spokane, Washington home. Rand had been programming games as a junior high school student in the 1980s, while Robyn studied music and arts in high school. The two found a common ground through the Macintosh Hypercard development program which allowed them to mix their talents together. Cyan originally produced adventure games for children. The company&#x27;s early titles, &quot;The Manhole&quot; (1988), &quot;Cosmic Osmo and the Worlds Beyond the Mackerel&quot; (1989) and &quot;Spelunx&quot; (1991) were whimsical fantasy adventures for a young audience. The games offered numerous graphical screens with puzzles, mini-games and activities. Some of these titles were early forays of Cyan into both construction of interactive worlds using HyperCard and the CD-ROM medium, both of which would later be used for &quot;Myst&quot;.

===&quot;Myst&quot;, &quot;Riven&quot; and sequels (1993–2004)===
In 1993, Cyan shot to worldwide fame with the release of &quot;Myst&quot;, a 3D pre-rendered adventure game aimed at an older audience unlike their previous games. &quot;Myst&quot; was one of the earliest CD-ROM games during a time when CD-ROM drives were beginning to become mainstream. The title sold more than six million copies and was the best-selling PC game ever, until &quot;The Sims&quot; exceeded &quot;Myst&quot; sales in 2002.

With the revenue from &quot;Myst&quot;, Cyan quickly moved to a new headquarters to accommodate a bigger staff, where they remain today. During this time, three novels set in the &quot;Myst&quot; universe were co-authored by the Millers and David Wingrove. The sequel to &quot;Myst&quot;, &quot;Riven&quot;, was released in 1997. After its release, Robyn opted to leave Cyan to pursue other interests, primarily working on independent film production. In a 1999 interview, Robyn stated that the reason for his departure was that &quot;Two people can&#x27;t pilot a ship – someone must be in charge...The parting gave us each a ship.&quot;

The next eight years saw a huge amount of expansion in the &quot;Myst&quot; franchise, both from within and outside of Cyan. While the publishing rights were transferred from Broderbund to Mattel, and then to Ubisoft, Cyan prepared for the next game in the Myst universe, which was to be a massively multiplayer online game, and not a direct sequel to &quot;Myst&quot;. During this time, the company started going by the name &quot;Cyan Worlds, Inc.&quot;. Partly as a test of their new real-time 3D engine, Cyan released &quot;realMyst&quot; in 2000, a complete recreation of the original &quot;Myst&quot; game. At the same time, the next &quot;Myst&quot; game, &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;, was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft, and released in 2001.

In 2003, Cyan announced that their multiplayer adventure, &quot;Uru&quot;, formerly known under the working titles &quot;DIRT&quot; (&quot;D&#x27;ni In Real Time&quot;), &quot;Mudpie&quot; (&quot;Multi-User DIRT – Persistent Interactive Environment&quot;), &quot;Parable&quot; and &quot;Myst Online&quot;, would be split into separate single-player and multiplayer components, at the request of the publisher Ubisoft. The single-player component, &quot;&quot;, was released later that year. The multiplayer component, &quot;Uru Live&quot; had a short beta test, but was cancelled before being officially released.

===&quot;Uru&quot; and the return of &quot;Uru Live&quot; (2004–2007)===

In 2004, Cyan released two &quot;&quot; expansion packs (&quot;To D&#x27;ni&quot; and &quot;The Path of the Shell&quot;) that included content originally intended for the online component. The same year, Ubisoft independently developed and released &quot;Myst IV: Revelation&quot;, the second game in the series not developed by Cyan. In the following year, Cyan developed the final chapter in the Myst series, &quot;Myst V: End of Ages&quot;. After &quot;Myst V&quot;, the company laid off most of its employees due to financial difficulties, but shortly after rehired almost everyone after negotiating a deal with Turner Broadcasting. Prior to this, the company was working on an as yet unannounced project (reportedly named &quot;Latus&quot; by Richard A. Watson) and negotiating with an undisclosed publisher, but its status is now unclear, though Rand Miller made mention of it in August 2011 and confirmed its name as Latus.

After &quot;Uru Live&quot; closed, fans began developing their own server software. In response to this demand, Cyan Worlds released &quot;Untìl Uru&quot; in late 2004, a modified version of the client and server software of &quot;Live&quot;. This version of the game was unsupported – servers were owned and operated by fans, and no new content was provided. Later, through funding by GameTap, Cyan managed to offer the &quot;D&#x27;mala&quot; shard, an official game server. Fans also began developing new content for the game, in an unofficial context.

In 2006, Rand Miller announced that &quot;Uru Live&quot; would return in full capacity using GameTap-hosted servers and funding. Cyan staff were re-hired and production of new Uru content began.

====Additional releases====
On November 30, 2007, Cyan released &quot;Cosmic Osmo&#x27;s Hex Isle&quot; via the online service Fanista. This marked the return of the Cosmic Osmo character after 15 years.

In August 2009, it was announced that Cyan Worlds would be working with Creative Kingdoms to create an online version of their &quot;MagiQuest&quot; virtual reality game. &quot;MagiQuest Online&quot; makes use of the Plasma engine used in &quot;Myst Online: Uru Live&quot;.

===The decline of the &quot;Uru&quot; era (2007–2011)===
&quot;Myst Online: Uru Live&quot; launched officially on GameTap on February 15, 2007, after being available through GameTap as an open beta for a few months. This was the most successful incarnation of &quot;Uru&quot;, finally achieving the original goal of supported online play, with ongoing content releases. Despite this success, GameTap announced on February 4, 2008, that it would be closing &quot;Uru Live&quot;. Game servers remained online for 60 days following, and were finally shut down on April 10, 2008.

On June 30, 2008, it was announced that Cyan Worlds had regained the rights to &quot;Uru&quot;, and had plans to relaunch it under the name &quot;Myst Online: Restoration Experiment&quot;. Cyan no longer has funds available for further development on the game, and instead intends to release the code for the servers, client and tools as open-source software, and rely on user-generated content for expansion.

In November 2008, &quot;Cyan Test&quot; (a third &quot;Cyan&quot; company created to provide testing services) laid off about 50 game testers. The layoffs came as a result of the acquisition of their primary customer Gamecock Media.

In February 2010, Cyan took steps towards opening up &quot;Uru&quot;, with the launch of a new &quot;Myst Online: Uru Live&quot; server (dubbed &quot;MOULagain&quot; by fans) with access to all of the Ages of &quot;Uru&quot;. They made the client software available free of charge and began accepting donations. As of April 2014, over 128,000 accounts had been created.

On April 6, 2011, Cyan released the source code to the URU client as well its development tools.

===&quot;Obduction&quot; (2013–2018)===
On October 17, 2013, Rand Miller announced a new video game designed as a spiritual successor to &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;Riven&quot; called &quot;Obduction&quot;. The game received $1.3 million in funding from Kickstarter support. &quot;Obduction&quot; takes place on an alien planet where humans and portions of their environment have been transported, and features puzzles that involve the combination of human technology with alien ones. &quot;Obduction&quot;″s world is fully rendered within the Unreal Engine and explorable from the first-person view, though uses full-motion video for some non-player characters. Rand got Robyn&#x27;s help to create the soundtrack as well as act as one of the non-player characters in the game. The game was officially released on August 24, 2016 for Microsoft Windows and OS X, and later for Oculus Rift. &quot;Obduction&quot; received favorable reviews from critics, comparing as a worthy successor to Cyan&#x27;s &quot;Myst&quot; games.

===&quot;Firmament&quot; (2018–2023)===

On March 1, 2018, Cyan announced &quot;Firmament&quot;, which they described as &quot;a new VR experience&quot;, though will also be available for standard displays. Like &quot;Obduction&quot;, Cyan launched a Kickstarter on March 26, 2018 to raise funding for the game. The Kickstarter was successful, securing versions of the game for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and PlayStation 4/PlayStation VR systems. &quot;Firmament&quot; was released on May 18, 2023.

=== Remakes and re-releases (2018–present) ===
On April 9, 2018, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the original &quot;Myst&quot;, Cyan announced via Kickstarter that they had acquired the legal rights to &quot;Exile&quot; and &quot;Revelation&quot; and were re-releasing the entire series, including the complete &quot;Uru&quot; and &quot;realMyst: Masterpiece Edition&quot;, on both DVD-ROM and digital download on GOG.com and Steam. Cyan has also worked with GOG.com to upgrade all of the games in the franchise to full compatibility with modern Windows operating systems. The Kickstarter campaign included a number of specific perks (such as a &quot;working&quot; Myst Linking Book with LED screen as the box for the physical copies of the games) for the anniversary editions, which would ship in November 2018. The pledged goal for the Kickstarter campaign was before May 24; this initial goal was attained within eight hours, and within two weeks, the amount of donations exceeded $1 million. The campaign closed on May 24 at $2,810,127, over 1100% of the pledged goal, with 19,304 backers. &quot;Exile&quot; and &quot;Revelation&quot;, along with updated versions of the other games of the series, appeared on GOG.com and Steam in Summer/Fall 2018.

On September 16, 2020, Cyan announced &quot;Myst&quot;, a VR remake which they described as &quot;the definitive version&quot; of the original game, though it will also be available for standard displays. &quot;Myst&quot; uses Unreal Engine 4 and was released as a timed exclusive for the Oculus Quest December 10, 2020, followed by a Windows, macOS, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One version on August 26, 2021.

== Technology ==
==Games developed==
===D&#x27;ni universe===
Most of Cyan&#x27;s titles (those in the &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;&quot; series) tell the story of a humanoid race called the D&#x27;ni, who have the ability to write linking books. Linking books teleport the user into other worlds, limited only by the imagination of the author. These worlds are referred to as &quot;Ages.&quot; Cyan&#x27;s games are known for their intricate plots, exquisite graphics, and immersive sounds. They focus on exploration and storytelling, presented by a simple, elegant interface that appeals to gamers and non-gamers alike. Related to the storyline of the D&#x27;ni are three Myst novels: &quot;The Book of Atrus&quot;, &quot;The Book of Ti&#x27;ana&quot; and &quot;The Book of D&#x27;ni&quot;. (Due to not being developed in-house by Cyan, Exile and Revelation were not included in this list.)

===Other games===
== Games published ==
Cyan announced in November 2018 the formation of a new publishing label, Cyan Ventures, to publish games for virtual reality and other platforms. Rand Miller said of the label, &quot;Like with Myst, we know we are on the edge of something...VR has a magical feel, where it takes you to another place. It still feels like we need to push it forward. We are saying let&#x27;s take the ball and help define this medium.&quot; One title from Cyan Ventures is &quot;ZED&quot; from Eagre Games, a studio formed by former Cyan developer Chuck Carter, released June 4, 2019.

<text>Seth Woodbury MacFarlane (; born October 26, 1973) is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, director, comedian, and singer. He is best known as the creator and star of the television series &quot;Family Guy&quot; (since 1999) and &quot;The Orville&quot; (2017–2022), and co-creator of the television series &quot;American Dad!&quot; (since 2005) and &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; (2009–2013). He also co-wrote, co-produced, directed, and starred in the films &quot;Ted&quot; (2012) and its sequel &quot;Ted 2&quot; (2015), and &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot; (2014).

MacFarlane is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he studied animation. He was recruited to Hollywood as an animator and writer for Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s television series &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; and &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;; during this time, he created the animated short &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;—a loose precursor of &quot;Family Guy&quot;—for &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;. In 2008, he created the online series &quot;Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy&quot;. MacFarlane has also made guest appearances as an actor on live action shows including &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;The War at Home&quot;, and &quot;FlashForward&quot;. MacFarlane has won several awards for his work on &quot;Family Guy&quot;, including five Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2009, he won the Webby Award for Film &amp; Video Person of the Year.

MacFarlane has performed as a vocalist at the Hollywood Bowl, Carnegie Hall, and the Royal Albert Hall. He has released eight studio albums, in the vein of Frank Sinatra, with influences from jazz orchestrations, and Hollywood musicals beginning with &quot;Music Is Better Than Words&quot; in 2011. MacFarlane has received five Grammy Award nominations for his work. He has frequently collaborated with artists such as Sara Bareilles, Norah Jones, and Elizabeth Gillies on his albums. He hosted the 85th Academy Awards in 2013 and was nominated for Best Original Song for &quot;Everybody Needs a Best Friend&quot; from &quot;Ted&quot;.

MacFarlane was executive producer of the Neil deGrasse Tyson-hosted &quot;&quot;, an update of the 1980s hosted by Carl Sagan. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2019 and was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Early life and education==
MacFarlane was born and raised in Kent, Connecticut. His parents, Ronald Milton MacFarlane (b. 1946) and Ann Perry (née Sager; 1947–2010), were born in Newburyport, Massachusetts. His younger sister Rachael is also a voice actress. His maternal grandfather, Arthur Sager, competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics in track and field. MacFarlane&#x27;s parents met in 1970 when they lived and worked in Boston, and married later that year. They moved to Kent in 1972, where Ann began working in the admissions office at South Kent School. She later worked in the college guidance and admissions offices at the Kent School, a selective college preparatory school, where Ronald was a teacher.

As a child, MacFarlane developed an interest in illustration, and at the age of two he began drawing cartoon characters such as Fred Flintstone and Woody Woodpecker. By age five, he knew he wanted to pursue a career in animation, and began by creating flip books after his parents found a book on the subject for him. Four years later, at nine, he began publishing a weekly comic strip, &quot;Walter Crouton&quot;, for &quot;The Kent Good Times Dispatch&quot;, the local newspaper; it paid him five dollars per week. MacFarlane said in an October 2011 interview that as a child he was always &quot;weirdly fascinated by the Communion ceremony&quot;. He created a strip with a character kneeling at the altar taking Communion and asking &quot;Can I have fries with that?&quot; The paper printed it and he got an &quot;angry letter&quot; from the local priest; it led to &quot;sort of a little mini-controversy&quot; in the town. MacFarlane received his high school diploma in 1991 from the Kent School. While there, he continued experimenting with animation, and his parents gave him an 8 mm camera.

After graduating from high school, MacFarlane attended the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he majored in animation. As a student, he intended to work for Disney, but changed his mind after seeing &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. During his time at RISD, he performed stand-up comedy. He also starred in many student films, meeting future &quot;Family Guy&quot; cast member Mike Henry, whose brother Patrick was MacFarlane&#x27;s classmate. In his senior year, he made his thesis film, &quot;The Life of Larry&quot;, which became the inspiration for &quot;Family Guy&quot;. A professor submitted his film to the animation studio Hanna-Barbera, where he was later hired. He graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.

==Career==
===Television career===
====Hanna-Barbera years====
MacFarlane was recruited during the senior film festival by development executive Ellen Cockrill and President Fred Seibert. He went to work at Hanna-Barbera (then Hanna-Barbera Cartoons) based on the writing content of &quot;The Life of Larry&quot;, rather than on his drawing abilities. He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent. He worked as an animator and writer for Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Cartoon Cartoons&quot; series. He created a sequel to &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; entitled &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;, featuring a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. The short was broadcast as one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot;. He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an &quot;old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or you jump from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another&quot;. MacFarlane worked on three television series during his tenure at the studio: &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, and &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;. Working as both a writer and storyboard artist, MacFarlane spent the most time on &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;. He found it easier to develop his own style at &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; through the show&#x27;s process of scriptwriting, which &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; did not use. As a part of the &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; crew, he met actors and voiceover artists such as Adam West and Jack Sheldon of &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; fame. These meetings later became significant to the production and success of his &quot;Family Guy&quot; series.

He also did freelance work for Walt Disney Television Animation, writing for &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;, and for Nelvana, where he wrote for &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;. Through strict observation of writing elements such as story progression, character stakes and plot points, MacFarlane found the work for Disney was, from a writing standpoint, very valuable in preparation for his career (particularly on &quot;Ace Ventura&quot;). He also created and wrote a short titled &quot;Zoomates&quot; for Frederator Studios&#x27; &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; on Nickelodeon. Executives at the Fox Broadcasting Company saw both &quot;Larry&quot; shorts and negotiations soon began for a prime-time animated series.

====&quot;Family Guy&quot;====

Although MacFarlane enjoyed working at Hanna-Barbera, he felt his real calling was for prime-time animation, which would allow a much edgier style of humor. He first pitched &quot;Family Guy&quot; to Fox during his tenure at Hanna-Barbera. A development executive there, who was trying to get back into prime-time business, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Kolins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; in 1997, MacFarlane called Kolins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. Fox offered the young writer a strange deal: They gave him a budget of $50,000 () to produce a pilot that could lead to a series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least $1 million). Recalling the experience in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, MacFarlane said: &quot;I spent about six months with no sleep and no life, just drawing like crazy in my kitchen and doing this pilot.&quot;

After six months, MacFarlane returned to Fox with a &quot;very, very simply, crudely animated film—with just enough to get the tone of the show across&quot; to present to the executives, who loved the pilot and immediately ordered the series. In July 1998, they announced the purchase of &quot;Family Guy&quot; for a January 1999 debut. &quot;Family Guy&quot; was originally intended to be a series of shorts on &quot;MADtv&quot;, much in the same way &quot;The Simpsons&quot; had begun on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; a decade earlier. Negotiations for the show&#x27;s &quot;MADtv&quot; connection fell through early on as a result of budgetary concerns. At age 24, MacFarlane was television&#x27;s youngest executive producer.

&quot;Family Guy&quot; first aired January 31, 1999. MacFarlane&#x27;s work in animating &quot;Family Guy&quot; was influenced by Jackie Gleason and Hanna-Barbera along with examples from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot;. In addition to writing three episodes, &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot;, &quot;Family Guy Viewer Mail 1&quot;, and &quot;North by North Quahog&quot;, MacFarlane voices &quot;Family Guy&quot;″s main male characters of Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin, Brian Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire, as well as Tom Tucker, his son Jake Tucker, and other characters. Bolstered by high DVD sales and fan loyalty, &quot;Family Guy&quot; developed into a $1-billion franchise. On May 4, 2008, after approximately years of negotiations, MacFarlane reached a $100-million agreement with Fox to keep &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;American Dad!&quot; until 2012. It made him the world&#x27;s highest paid television writer.

MacFarlane&#x27;s success with &quot;Family Guy&quot; opened doors to other ventures relating to the show. On April 26, 2005, he and composer Walter Murphy created &quot;Family Guy: Live in Vegas&quot;. The soundtrack features a Broadway show tune theme, and MacFarlane voiced Stewie in the track &quot;Stewie&#x27;s Sexy Party&quot;. A fan of Broadway musicals, MacFarlane comments on using musicals as a component of &quot;Family Guy&quot;:

A &quot;Family Guy&quot; video game was released in 2006. Two years later, in August 2007, MacFarlane closed a digital content production deal with AdSense. He takes cast members on the road to voice characters in front of live audiences. &quot;Family Guy Live&quot; provides fans with the opportunity to hear future scripts. In mid-2007, Chicago fans had the opportunity to hear the then upcoming sixth-season premiere &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;. Shows have played in Montreal, New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles.
On July 22, 2007, in an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, MacFarlane announced that he might start work on a feature film, although &quot;nothing&#x27;s official&quot;. In September 2007, Ricky Blitt gave TV.com an interview confirming that he had already started working on the script. Then in &quot;TV Week&quot; on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released &quot;Family Guy&quot; feature film sometime &quot;within the next year&quot;. He came up with an idea for the story, &quot;something that you could not do on the show, which [to him] is the only reason to do a movie&quot;. He later went on to say he imagines the film to be &quot;an old-style musical with dialogue&quot; similar to &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, saying that he would &quot;really be trying to capture, musically, that feel&quot;. On October 13, 2011, MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a &quot;Family Guy&quot; film had been made, and that he would write it with series co-producer Ricky Blitt. On November 30, 2012, he confirmed plans for the project. The project was put on hold while MacFarlane worked on &quot;Ted 2&quot;. In 2018, Fox announced that a live-action/animated film based on the series is in development. MacFarlane stepped away from the series in 2011 to work on &quot;Ted&quot; and other projects, and has only been associated with the show as a voice actor since then.

Despite its popularity, &quot;Family Guy&quot; has often been criticized. The Parents Television Council has been a frequent critic. It organized a letter-writing campaign to remove it from Fox&#x27;s lineup, and filed complaints with the Federal Communications Commission alleging that some of its episodes contained indecent content. MacFarlane has responded to the PTC&#x27;s criticism by saying, among other things: &quot;That&#x27;s like getting hate mail from Hitler. They&#x27;re literally terrible human beings.&quot;

&quot;Family Guy&quot; has been cancelled twice, although strong fan support and DVD sales have caused Fox to reconsider. MacFarlane mentioned how these cancellations affected the lineup of writers: &quot;One of the positive aspects of &quot;Family Guy&quot; constantly being pulled off [the air] is that we were always having to re staff writers.&quot;

During its sixth season, episodes of &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;American Dad!&quot; were delayed from regular broadcast due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. MacFarlane participated in the strike to support the writers, and Fox aired three &quot;Family Guy&quot; episodes without his permission. The strike ended on February 12, 2008, and the series resumed airing regularly, beginning with &quot;Back to the Woods&quot;.

====&quot;American Dad!&quot;====

MacFarlane has a second long-running, successful adult animated series in &quot;American Dad!&quot; which has been in production since early 2005. To date, it is his only animated series that has never been cancelled, though it did undergo a network relocation from Fox to TBS on October 20, 2014, following its 11th season. TBS announced on July 16, 2013, that they had picked up the series for a 15-episode 12th season. The purpose of the network relocation was originally to make room for new comedies on FOX, such as &quot;Mulaney&quot; and another animated series from Seth MacFarlane called &quot;Bordertown&quot; on Fox&#x27;s now-defunct &quot;Animation Domination&quot; programming block.

While MacFarlane does extensive voice acting work for &quot;American Dad!&quot;, he has left much of its creative direction up to Matt Weitzman and Mike Barker, feeling it helps give the series its own voice and identity. It was announced on November 4, 2013, that Barker would depart &quot;American Dad!&quot; after 10 seasons as producer/co-showrunner.

&quot;American Dad!&quot; was first shown after Super Bowl XXXIX, debuting with the episode &quot;Pilot&quot;, which MacFarlane co-wrote. This February 6, 2005, series premiere was somewhat of an early sneak preview as the program did not begin airing regularly until May 1, 2005. Because of atypical scheduling of the show&#x27;s first 7 episodes, &quot;American Dad!&quot; has a controversial season number discrepancy in which many are divided as to how many seasons the program has had. Beyond division between media journalists and fans, there have been conflicting reports as to what season the show is in even between &quot;American Dad!&quot; creators and the show&#x27;s official website—both from its original Fox website and now from TBS website. At San Diego Comic-Con in 2013, Barker hinted that an &quot;American Dad!&quot; movie—centering on the Roger character and set from his birth planet—is in the works and partially written. However, at San Diego Comic-Con in 2022, Weitzman revealed plans for the film were scrapped.

MacFarlane has described the initial seasons of &quot;American Dad!&quot; as being similar to &quot;All in the Family&quot;, likening title character Stan Smith&#x27;s originally bigoted persona to Archie Bunker. MacFarlane has also stated that his inspiration to create &quot;American Dad!&quot; derived from his and Weitzman&#x27;s exasperation with George W. Bush&#x27;s policies as former United States President. After the early couple of seasons however, the series discontinued using these elements of political satire and began to serve up its own brand of entertainment and humor. MacFarlane was described as having difficulty understanding the series in its early going; however, he heavily warmed up to the series after its early seasons once he felt the show truly came into its own. His fellow co-creators have sensed this through MacFarlane&#x27;s greatly increased attention to the series after its early seasons. MacFarlane has also revealed he is an &quot;American Dad!&quot; fan himself. He has taken note of the positive reaction to the &quot;Roger&quot; character by fans via his Twitter.

The show focuses on the Smith family: Stan Smith, the endangering, , rash and inconsiderate head of the household. He has an exaggeratedly large chin and masculine manner about him. As the family&#x27;s breadwinner, he works as a CIA officer and was initially portrayed in the series as an old-fashioned conservative bigot but has since grown out of these traits (the show is known for its story arc elements and other distinguishing plot techniques); Stan&#x27;s moralistic yet simultaneously inappropriate, corrupt wife, Francine; and their two children, new-age hippie daughter Hayley and nerdy son Steve. Accompanying the Smith family are three additional main characters, two of which belong to non-human species: zany, shocking, blithely cruel and rascally alien Roger, who&#x27;s full of disguises/alter egos and has few if any limits on his behaviors. He was rescued by Stan from Area 51; Klaus, the man-in-a-fish-body pet. Klaus&#x27;s unenviable situation came about from the brain of an East German Olympic skier being shrunk and transplanted into a fish body; and Jeff Fischer, Hayley&#x27;s boyfriend turned &quot;whipped&quot; husband, known for his infatuation with Hayley&#x27;s mom, Francine. Together, the Smiths and their three housemates run what is only at a first glance the typical middle-class American lifestyle, but is anything but.

MacFarlane provides the voices of Stan and Roger, basing Roger&#x27;s voice on Paul Lynde (who played Uncle Arthur in &quot;Bewitched&quot;). His sister Rachael MacFarlane provides the voice of Hayley.

====&quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;====

MacFarlane developed a &quot;Family Guy&quot; spin-off called &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, which focuses on the character of Cleveland Brown and his family. The idea for the show originated from a suggestion by &quot;Family Guy&quot; writer and voice of Cleveland, Mike Henry. Fox ordered 22 episodes and the series first aired on September 27, 2009. The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes, was picked up by Fox for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009, before the first season even premiered. Due to strong ratings, Fox picked up the back nine episodes of season 2, making a 22-episode season and bringing the total episode count of the show to 44. The series ended on May 19, 2013, with a total of 4 seasons and 88 episodes. The character of Cleveland and his family returned to &quot;Family Guy&quot; in the episode &quot;He&#x27;s Bla-ack!&quot;.

This is the only animated series created by MacFarlane that does not have him voicing the main character. MacFarlane did, however, play the character Tim the Bear until season 3 episode 10. Jess Harnell voiced Tim from season 3 episode 11 onwards.

====&quot;Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy&quot;====

In 2008, MacFarlane released a series of webisodes known as &quot;Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy&quot; with its animated shorts sponsored by Burger King and released weekly.

====&quot;The Orville&quot;====

In 2016, MacFarlane began producing the sci-fi comedy-drama series &quot;The Orville&quot;, in which he also stars as Captain Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Mercer. MacFarlane originally wrote &quot;The Orville&quot; as a spec script, which was given a 13-episode order by Fox in May 2016, making it the first live-action television series created by MacFarlane. The series premiered on September 10, 2017. Despite the first season receiving negative reviews, it was renewed for a second season. The second season premiered on December 30, 2018, and received better reviews.

The series was renewed for a third season by Fox, however the series would move over to Hulu. This season is the show&#x27;s first on Hulu, after airing its previous two seasons on Fox, as well as the first to premiere since The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s March 2019 acquisition of 20th Century Fox. The season was originally scheduled to premiere in 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The third season titled as &quot;The Orville: New Horizons&quot; premiered on June 2, 2022. Due to the pandemic, an episode of third season was scrapped, which MacFarlane subsequently turned into a novel, titled &quot;The Orville: Sympathy for the Devil&quot;.

====Television producing====
MacFarlane was the executive producer of a live-action sitcom starring Rob Corddry called &quot;The Winner&quot;. The plot has a man named Glen discussing the time he matured at 32 and has him pursuing his only love after she moves in next door. Glen meets her son and both become good friends. The show ran on Fox for six episodes in Spring 2007.

In August 2011, Fox ordered a 13-part updated series of &quot;&quot;. MacFarlane co-produced the series with Ann Druyan and Steven Soter. The new series is hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson and began airing on the channel in March 2014, with repeats airing on the National Geographic Channel on the next night. In addition to serving as one of the executive producers, MacFarlane provided voices for characters during the animated portions of the series. MacFarlane returned to executive produce and provide voices to its sequel series, &quot;&quot;, which aired in 2020.

In 2013 and 2014, MacFarlane produced one season of a live-action sitcom called &quot;Dads&quot;. The series, revolves around Eli, played by Seth Green, and Warner, played by Giovanni Ribisi, two successful guys in their 30s whose world is turned upside down when their dads move in with them. MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild executive-produced the series, with Sulkin and Wild writing.

In 2014, MacFarlane executive produced a two-season, 20-episode series called &quot;Blunt Talk&quot; for Starz. The series followed an English newscaster who moves to Los Angeles with his alcoholic manservant and the baggage of several failed marriages to host a sanctimonious talk show.

In 2009, MacFarlane began work on the animated series &quot;Bordertown&quot;. The series is set in Texas and follows a border patrol agent and a Mexican immigrant, satirizing America&#x27;s changing cultural landscape. It ran for 13 episodes in the first half of 2016, on Fox.

====Television hosting====
MacFarlane has participated in the Comedy Central Roasts. MacFarlane is the only person to serve as roastmaster for more than one roast. In 2010, he filled this role for the roast of David Hasselhoff. The following year he was roastmaster at the roasts of Donald Trump and Charlie Sheen.

On October 1, 2012, it was announced that MacFarlane would host the 85th Academy Awards on February 24, 2013. He also presented the nominees with actress Emma Stone, on January 10, 2013. In addition to hosting, MacFarlane was also nominated in the Academy Award for Best Original Song category for co-writing the theme song &quot;Everybody Needs a Best Friend&quot; for his film &quot;Ted&quot; with Walter Murphy. Critical response to MacFarlane&#x27;s performance was mixed. Columnist Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented &quot;By calling constant attention to the naughty factor,&quot; MacFarlane created &quot;an echo chamber of outrage, working a little too hard to top himself with faux-scandalous gags about race, Jews in Hollywood, and the killing of Abraham Lincoln.&quot; Tim Goodman of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised MacFarlane&#x27;s performance saying that he did &quot;impressively better than one would have wagered&quot;. He also noted that he added &quot;plenty of niceties with a little bit of the Ricky Gervais bite-the-hand-that-feeds-you thing and worked the juxtaposition rather nicely&quot;. He stirred up controversy in the form of a musical number titled &quot;We Saw Your Boobs&quot;.

On October 29, 2014, it was announced that MacFarlane would host the Breakthrough Prize ceremony. The event was held in Silicon Valley and televised on November 15, 2014, on Discovery Channel and Science, and globally on November 22, 2014, on BBC World News. He returned to host the following year.

===Film career===
====&quot;Ted&quot;====

MacFarlane made his directorial live-action film debut with the release of &quot;Ted&quot; in 2012. He announced that he was directing it on an episode of &quot;Conan&quot; that aired on February 10, 2011. Along with directing the film, he also wrote the screenplay, served as producer, and starred as the title character.

&quot;Ted&quot; tells the story of John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) and his talking teddy bear (MacFarlane) who keeps John and his girlfriend Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) from moving on with their lives. The film received generally favorable reviews from both critics and audiences, and was a box office success, opening with the highest weekend gross of all time for an original R-rated comedy. Internationally, the movie is currently the highest-grossing original R-rated comedy of all time, beating &quot;The Hangover&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Ted 2&quot;, was released on June 26, 2015.

It was announced in June 2021 that Peacock had given a straight to series order for a prequel series. In addition to serving as executive producer for the series, MacFarlane reprises his role as Ted. Due to its prequel nature, Wahlberg and Kunis do not reprise their roles.

====&quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot;====

MacFarlane co-wrote and starred in his second film, &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot;. Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild were also co-writers for the film.

But when her outlaw husband arrives seeking revenge, the farmer must put his newfound courage to the test. The film was met with mixed to negative reviews from critics.

An audio-book version was also made available, narrated by Jonathan Frakes. MacFarlane wrote the book on weekends during shooting for the film, partially due to boredom.

In 2022, he released his seventh studio album, &quot;Blue Skies&quot;. In November 2023, MacFarlane released a collaborative Christmas album with Gillies titled &quot;We Wish You the Merriest&quot;.

In June of the same year, Neeson stated that MacFarlane was working on a new draft of the script, with the studio additionally negotiating the filmmaker&#x27;s potential role as director. He expressed excitement for the project and the opportunity to explore a more comedic role, should he decide to star in the movie; while stating that development on the project is ongoing.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===

MacFarlane has a baritone voice. He is a pianist and singer who, in his early years, trained with Lee and Sally Sweetland, the vocal coaches of Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra. In an interview with NPR, he commented on their training style: &quot;They really drill you. They teach you the old-style way of singing, back when you had no electronic help ... [They teach you to] show your teeth. If you look at old photos of Sinatra while he&#x27;s singing, there&#x27;s a lot of very exposed teeth. That was something Lee Sweetland hit on day in and day out, and correctly so, because it just brightens the whole performance.&quot;
In 2009, MacFarlane appeared as a vocalist at the BBC Proms with the John Wilson Orchestra in Prom 22, &quot;A Celebration of Classic MGM Film Musicals&quot;. In 2010, he reappeared at the Proms with the John Wilson Orchestra in a Christmas concert special. In 2012, it was announced he would again appear at the Proms with the John Wilson Orchestra in a concert celebrating Broadway musicals. In 2015, MacFarlane again appeared at The Proms as a vocalist with the John Wilson Orchestra, this time in a Sinatra program. Regarding his musical passion, MacFarlane has said, &quot;I love and am fascinated by exciting orchestration—what you can do with a band that size—and I think in many ways it&#x27;s a lost art.&quot; His music is predominantly vocal jazz, show tunes and swing. He also uses musical comedy in his shows and movies.

===Influences===
MacFarlane has said that his comedy influences include Woody Allen, Jackie Gleason, Mel Brooks, Monty Python, Matt Groening, and Norman Lear; while his musical influences include Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Vic Damone, Johnny Mercer, Bing Crosby, Bobby Darin, Gordon MacRae and the Rat Pack.

==Activism==
===Political views===
MacFarlane is a supporter of the Democratic Party. He has donated over $200,000 to various Democratic congressional committees and to the 2008 presidential campaign of then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama. He has stated that he supports the legalization of cannabis.

In 2015, MacFarlane endorsed Bernie Sanders for the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and he introduced Sanders onstage at a Los Angeles rally. After the primaries, he supported Hillary Clinton for president during the general election. In 2019, he supported Pete Buttigieg in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. After the primaries, he endorsed Joe Biden for president during the general election. He endorsed Biden again for the 2024 U.S. presidential election. After Biden withdrew his candidacy, MacFarlane endorsed Kamala Harris.

===Gay rights advocacy===
MacFarlane is a supporter of gay rights. In 2008, prior to the holding of the &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; case by the United States Supreme Court, MacFarlane called it &quot;infuriating and idiotic&quot; that two gay partners &quot;have to go through this fucking dog and pony act when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, &#x27;You want one room or two?&#x27;&quot; He went on to say: &quot;I&#x27;m incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they&#x27;re dealing with at this current point in time.&quot;

In recognition of &quot;his active, passionate commitment to humanist values, and his fearless support of equal marriage rights and other social justice issues&quot;, MacFarlane was named the Harvard Humanist of the Year in 2011.

===Speaking engagements===
MacFarlane is a frequent speaking guest on college campuses. On April 16, 2006, he was invited by Stanford University&#x27;s ASSU Speakers&#x27; Bureau to address an audience of over 1,000 at Memorial Auditorium. He was invited by Harvard University&#x27;s class of 2006 to deliver the &quot;class day&quot; address on June 7, 2006. He spoke as himself, and also as Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin and Glenn Quagmire. He has also spoken at George Washington University, Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Missouri, Bowling Green State University, Loyola Marymount University, and University of California, Los Angeles.

===2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike===

During the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, MacFarlane publicly sided with the Writers Guild, and fully participated in the strike. Official production of &quot;Family Guy&quot; was halted for most of December 2007 and various periods afterwards. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane&#x27;s final approval, and although he refused to work on the show during the strike, his contract with Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it subsequently produced. Rumors of continued production on &quot;Family Guy&quot; prompted the statement from MacFarlane that &quot;...it would just be a colossal dick move if they did that&quot;. During the strike, MacFarlane wrote an inside joke into an episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; about Jon Stewart&#x27;s choice to return to the air and undermine the writers of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, causing Stewart to respond with an angry phone-call, harassing MacFarlane and arguing his point. The strike ended on February 12, 2008.

=== 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike ===
During the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike and the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, MacFarlane donated $1 million to The Entertainment Community Fund to Support Film and Television Workers During Strikes.

===The Seth MacFarlane Collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive===
In 2012, MacFarlane donated money to create The Seth MacFarlane Collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive at the Library of Congress. MacFarlane said, &quot;The work of Carl Sagan has been a profound influence in my life, and the life of every individual who recognizes the importance of humanity&#x27;s ongoing commitment to the exploration of our universe [...] The continuance of our journey outward into space should always occupy some part of our collective attention, regardless of whatever Snooki did last week.&quot; The collection opened on November 12, 2013.

=== Film preservation ===
On April 20, 2024 MacFarlane partnered with Martin Scorsese to showcase &quot;Back From the Ink: Restored Animated Shorts&quot; at the 2024 TCM Classic Film Festival. MacFarlane and Scorsese funded the restoration, and worked with the UCLA Film and Television Archive and The Film Foundation with Paramount Pictures Archives.

==Personal life==
MacFarlane lives in Beverly Hills, California. He is not married and has no children.

In a 2004 interview, he noted his similarities to Brian Griffin from &quot;Family Guy&quot;: &quot;I have some Brian type issues from time to time—looking for the right person—but I date as much as the next guy.&quot;

MacFarlane gave a speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, on September 10, 2001; the next morning he was scheduled to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11, one of the planes hijacked in the September 11 attacks. Due to a hangover after the previous night&#x27;s celebrations and an incorrect departure time (8:15 a.m. instead of 7:45 a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight, as the gates had been closed. Speaking of his experience of missing the fatal trip, MacFarlane said:The only reason it hasn&#x27;t really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn&#x27;t really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people have a lot of close calls; you&#x27;re crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car... This one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can&#x27;t let it affect me because I&#x27;m a comedy writer. I have to put that in the back of my head. The &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Boy (Dog) Meets Girl (Dog)&quot; references the incident.

On July 16, 2010, MacFarlane&#x27;s mother, Ann Perry Sager, died from cancer. Her death was reported by Larry King on his show &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, who acknowledged a conversation he had with her during an interview with MacFarlane in May 2010.

From 2012 to 2013, MacFarlane was in a relationship with the British actress Emilia Clarke.

MacFarlane is an atheist, explaining his beliefs, &quot;I do not believe in God. I&#x27;m an atheist. I consider myself a critical thinker, and it fascinates me that in the 21st century most people still believe in, as George Carlin puts it, &#x27;the invisible man living in the sky&#x27;.&quot;

==Lawsuits==
On October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing &quot;Family Guy&quot; of infringing its copyright on the song &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, through a parody song titled &quot;I Need a Jew&quot; appearing in the episode &quot;When You Wish Upon a Weinstein&quot;. Bourne Co., which holds the copyright, alleged the parody pairs a &quot;thinly veiled&quot; copy of their music with anti semitic lyrics. Named in the suit were MacFarlane, 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network and Walter Murphy; the suit sought to stop the program&#x27;s distribution and asked for unspecified damages. Bourne argued that &quot;I Need a Jew&quot; uses the copyrighted melody of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in &quot;Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.&quot; On March 16, 2009, United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that &quot;Family Guy&quot; did not infringe on Bourne&#x27;s copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode.

In December 2007, &quot;Family Guy&quot; was again accused of copyright infringement when actor Art Metrano filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot;, in which Jesus performs Metrano&#x27;s signature magic parody act, involving absurd faux magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune &quot;Fine and Dandy&quot;. MacFarlane, 20th Century Fox, Steve Callaghan, and Alex Borstein were all named in the suit. In July 2009, a federal district court judge rejected Fox&#x27;s motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved—&quot;purpose and character of the use&quot;, &quot;nature of the infringed work&quot;, and &quot;amount and substantiality of the taking&quot;—counted in Metrano&#x27;s favor, while the fourth—&quot;economic impact&quot;—had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers—not Metrano or his act. The case was settled out of court in 2010 with undisclosed terms.

On July 16, 2014, MacFarlane was served with a lawsuit from the production company of a series of Internet videos called &quot;Charlie the Abusive Teddy Bear&quot; claiming that &quot;Ted&quot; infringes on the copyright of its videos due to the Ted bear largely matching the background story, persona, voice tone, attitude, and dialogue of the Charlie bear. The suit was dismissed with prejudice on March 23, 2015, after the plaintiffs conceded Ted was independently created and withdrew the suit.

==Awards and nominations==

MacFarlane has been nominated for twenty-four Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on &quot;Family Guy&quot; and has won five times, in 2000, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2019. He has been nominated for five Grammy Awards for his work in &quot;Family Guy: Live in Vegas&quot;, &quot;Music Is Better Than Words&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;No One Ever Tells You&quot; and &quot;In Full Swing&quot;. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for co-writing the opening song, &quot;Everybody Needs a Best Friend&quot;, from his film &quot;Ted&quot; with the film&#x27;s composer Walter Murphy.

He has received numerous awards from other organizations, including the Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production and the Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation for the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode titled &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, the MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo and the Empire Award for Best Comedy for &quot;Ted&quot;. In 2019, MacFarlane received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6259 Hollywood Blvd. In 2020, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

In 2022, a new species of &quot;Hyloscirtus&quot; frog (&quot;Hyloscirtus sethmacfarlanei&quot;) was described from Ecuador and named after him.

<doc id="383902" wikidata="Q1942166" url="?curid=383902" title="Modified frequency modulation">
<text>Modified frequency modulation (MFM) is a run-length limited (RLL) line code used to encode data on most floppy disks and some hard disk drives. It was first introduced on hard disks in 1970 with the IBM 3330 and then in floppy disk drives beginning with the IBM 53FD in 1976. 

MFM is a modification to the original frequency modulation encoding (FM) code specifically for use with magnetic storage. MFM allowed devices to double the speed data was written to the media as the code guaranteed only one polarity change per encoded data bit. For this reason, MFM disks are typically known as &quot;double density&quot;, while the earlier FM became known as &quot;single density&quot;.

MFM is used with a data rate of 250–500 kbit/s (500–1000 kbit/s encoded) on industry-standard -inch and -inch ordinary and high-density floppy diskettes. MFM was also used in early hard disk designs, before the advent of more efficient types of RLL codes. Outside of niche applications, MFM encoding is obsolete in magnetic recording.

==Magnetic storage==
Magnetic storage devices, like hard drives and magnetic tape, store data not as absolute values, but in the changes in polarity. This is because a changing magnetic field will induce an electrical current in a nearby wire, and vice versa. By sending a series of changing currents to the read/write head while the media moves past it, the result will be a pattern of magnetic polarities on the media that change where the data was a &quot;1&quot;. The exact nature of the media determines how many of these changes can occur within a given surface area, and when this is combined with the nominal speed of movement, it produces the maximum data rate for that system.

Disk drives are subject to a variety of mechanical and materials effects that cause the original pattern of data to &quot;jitter&quot; in time. MFM as a run-length limited code limits the distance between recorded transitions so the jitter does not cause a transition to be misaligned in time, thereby causing a data error. Other limitations defined by the media place additional constraints on the way the data is recorded. A diverse range of suitable encodings, known generally as line codes, have been developed for this purpose. Their suitability depends on the media or transmission mechanism being used.

==Frequency modulation==
Frequency modulation encoding (FM) was the first widely used system to perform this operation on disk drives. The drive controller includes an accurate clock running at half the selected data rate of the disk media. When data is written to the disk, the clock signal is interleaved with the data. On reading, the clock signals are used as short-term triggers to time the presence or lack of a following signal that represents the data bits.

The upside to the FM approach is that it is extremely easy to implement the writing circuitry, and the clock recovery on reading is also relatively simple. The downside is that it uses up half of the disk surface for the clock signal, thus halving the total amount of data the disk can store. This led to the development of new forms of encoding that were more efficient.

== MFM coding ==
Modified frequency modulation encodes the clock signal and the data in a single &quot;clock window&quot;. Unlike FM, a clock bit is only written when needed to achieve synchronization when both current and preceding data bits are not set. On average, MFM achieves double the information density of FM.

The basic encoding rule for MFM is that (x, y, z, ...) encodes to (x, x NOR y, y, y NOR z, z, z NOR...). A zero bit is encoded as if preceded by a zero bit in the input stream, and if preceded by a one; a one bit is always encoded as . The number of magnetic transitions per one bit of encoded data is on average 0.75 to 1.

Note that the surrounding clock bits are sometimes known, but sometimes require knowledge of the adjacent data bits. A longer example:
 Data: 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 ...
 FM encoded: 10101011111011111...
 MFM clock: ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0...
 MFM encoded: ?0101001010001010...
(The bold bits are the data bits, the others are the clock bits.)

In FM encoding, the number of 0-bits that may appear between consecutive 1-bits is either 0 or 1. In MFM encoding there is a minimum of 1 zero bit between adjacent ones (there are never two adjacent one bits), and the maximum number of zeros in a row is 3. Thus, FM is a (0,1) RLL code, while MFM is a (1,3) code.

==Data separator==
Because the MFM system requires more accurate timing of the clock signal, it was not possible economically to build the required analog and digital components on a single integrated circuit using late 1970s technology. Instead, MFM drivers required the drive vendor to design their own clock recovery circuitry, a system known as the data separator. Data separator design was an art form of its own.

Among the most widely used controllers of the era was the Western Digital FD1771 series. The original FD1771 supported FM only, but it was quickly paired with the FD1781 and FD1791 which performed MFM based on an externally provided clock signal. Implementing MFM support with these drivers required an external data separator. Rapid improvement in IC manufacturing in the late 1970s and early 1980s led to the first low-cost all-in-one MFM drivers in the early 1980s. The WD2791 was the first to directly support MFM using an internal analog phase-locked loop, but it required a number of simple external components to implement a complete system. The WD1770 was the first to implement a complete MFM solution in a single chip.

==Overall format==

FM and MFM are used to indicate the position of individual bits in the original data, but the data does not in itself have any higher level of organization like &quot;files&quot;. This is the purpose of the format of the disk. Disks are typically formatted into fixed-sized sectors which contain additional header information to link them back to files.

In the IBM formats, the start of a sector&#x27;s header information and the start of the data itself are indicated with special &quot;sync mark&quot;, a pattern of 0s and 1s that cannot appear in the data itself. This is accomplished by not encoding this data using the FM or MFM encoding, making it easy for the driver to spot it. The sync mark that is commonly used in MFM encoding is known as the &quot;A1 sync&quot; since the data bits form the start of the hexadecimal value A1 (10100001), but the fifth clock bit is different from the normal encoding of the A1 byte.

 Data: 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
 Clock: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
 Encoded: 100010010101001
 Sync clock: 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
 Sync Mark: 100010010001001
 ^ Missing clock bit

== MMFM ==
MMFM (modified modified frequency modulation), also abbreviated M²FM or M2FM, is similar to MFM, but suppresses additional clock bits, producing a longer maximum run length (a (1,4) RLL code). In particular, a clock pulse is only inserted between a pair of adjacent 0-bits if the first bit of the pair did not have a clock pulse inserted before it. In the example below, clock bits that would have been present in MFM are noted in bold:
 Data: 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
 Clock: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
 Encoded: 01010001001001001000010010001001001000100001

In this system, sync marks are made by inserting additional clock pulses between adjacent zero bits (following the MFM rule) where they would normally be omitted. In particular, the data bit pattern &quot;100001&quot; has a clock pulse inserted in the middle, where it would normally be omitted:

 Data: 1 0 0 0 0 1
 Normal: 0 1 0 1 0
 Sync: 0 1 1 1 0

<doc id="383906" wikidata="Q954017" url="?curid=383906" title="Honorificabilitudinitatibus">
<text>Honorificabilitudinitatibus (&quot;honōrificābilitūdinitātibus&quot;, ) is the dative and ablative plural of the medieval Latin word , which can be translated as &quot;the state of being able to achieve honours&quot;. It is mentioned by the character Costard in Act V, Scene I of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;.

As it appears only once in Shakespeare&#x27;s works, it is a hapax legomenon in the Shakespeare canon. At letters, it is the longest word in the English language to strictly alternate between consonants and vowels.

==Use in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;==
The word is spoken by the comic rustic Costard in Act V, Scene 1 of the play. It is used after an absurdly pretentious dialogue between the pedantic schoolmaster Holofernes and his friend Sir Nathaniel. The two pedants converse in a mixture of Latin and florid English. When Moth, a witty young servant, enters, Costard says of the pedants:
==Use in Baconianism==
The word has been used by adherents of the Baconian theory who believe Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were written in steganographic cypher by Francis Bacon. In 1905 Isaac Hull Platt argued that it was an anagram for &quot;hi ludi, F. Baconis nati, tuiti orbi&quot;, Latin for &quot;these plays, F. Bacon&#x27;s offspring, are preserved for the world&quot;. His argument was given wide circulation by Edwin Durning-Lawrence in 1910, complete with a cryptonumerical attempt to prove it justified. The anagram assumes that Bacon would have Latinized his name as &quot;Baco&quot; or &quot;Bacon&quot; (the genitive case of which is &quot;Baconis&quot;) rather than, as Samuel Schoenbaum argues, &quot;Baconus&quot;, with genitive &quot;Baconi&quot;.

It is far from the only possible anagram. In 1898, Paget Toynbee noted that the word contains a glorification of Dante by himself as its letters could be rearranged to form the phrase &quot;Ubi Italicus ibi Danti honor fit&quot; (Where there is an Italian, there honour is paid to Dante). In the 1970s, John Sladek noted that the word could also be anagrammatized as &quot;I, B. Ionsonii, uurit [&quot;writ&quot;] a lift&#x27;d batch&quot;, thus &quot;proving&quot; that Shakespeare&#x27;s works were written by Ben Jonson. In 2012, in a column for the Calcutta &quot;Telegraph&quot;, Stephen Hugh-Jones mocked it with the deliberately anachronistic &quot;If I built it in, is author ID Bacon?&quot;, attributing this to a derisive William Shakespeare; and counter-&quot;proved&quot; that Shakespeare wrote Bacon by converting the latter&#x27;s famous opening phrase &quot;What is truth, said jesting Pilate...&quot; into &quot;Truth? A lasting jape. Hide it. WS&quot;.

==Other uses==
Long before &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, the word and its variants had been used by medieval and then Renaissance authors.

===Medieval===
The unusually long word had apparently already been in circulation among scholars by the time of Petrus Grammaticus, 8th-century Italian poet, deacon, grammarian, and Charlemagne&#x27;s primary Latin teacher. It can be found in Codex Bernensis 522 (Burgerbibliothek of Berne, Cod. 522), an early-9th-century manuscript copy of his work.

Italian lexicographer Papias used it circa 1055.

&quot;Honorificabilitudo&quot; appears in a charter of 1187 by Ugone della Volta, second Archbishop of Genoa.

Various forms of the word were also discussed in &quot;Magnae Derivationes&quot;, an early etymological treatise of circa 1190 by Uguccione, Italian canon lawyer and Bishop of Ferrara:
It also appears in &quot;Ars poetica&quot;, treatise on rhetoric of circa 1208–1216 by English-born French scholar Gervase of Melkley:

Italian grammarian Johannes Balbus used the word in its complete form in his hugely popular 1286 Latin dictionary known as &quot;Catholicon&quot; (in 1460, it became one of the first books to be printed using Gutenberg&#x27;s press). Quoting Uguccione, it says regarding &quot;honorifico&quot;:
A late-13th-century example can be found in an anonymous sermon in a manuscript in Bodleian Library (MS Bodl. 36, f. 131v).

In his linguistic essay &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot; (&quot;On eloquence in the vernacular&quot;) of circa 1302–1305 Dante, drawing on Uguccione&#x27;s &quot;Magnae Derivationes&quot;, cites &quot;honorificabilitudinitate&quot; as an example of a word too long for the standard line in verse:
&quot;Honorificabilitudinitas&quot; occurs in &quot;De gestis Henrici septimi Cesaris&quot; (1313–1315), a book by the Italian poet Albertino Mussato which chronicled 1310–1313 Italian expedition of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor:

It was for this work that in 1315 the commune of Padua crowned Mussato as poet laureate; he was the first man to receive the honour since antiquity.

It is also found on an Exchequer record, in a hand of the reign of Henry VI (1422–1461).
The word appears in &quot;Adagia&quot;, an annotated collection of Greek and Latin proverbs, compiled by Dutch humanist Erasmus; he recalls a humorous couplet about a man called Hermes who was fond of using foot-and-a-half words:

First published in 1500, by Shakespeare&#x27;s time it was a very popular book, widely used as a text-book in English schools. The couplet itself was a popular schoolboy joke, current both in Erasmus&#x27;s and Shakespeare&#x27;s times, and beyond.

In the foreword to his 1529 translation of Lucan, French humanist and engraver Geoffroy Tory used the word as an example of bad writing, citing the Hermes couplet.

It also occurs in the works of Rabelais and in &quot;The Complaynt of Scotland&quot; (1549).

The word in its various forms was frequently used as test of the pen by scribes. One example is found in a fourteenth-century Pavian codex. It may also be seen, with some additional syllables, scribbled on a page of a late-16th-century heraldic manuscript (British Library, MS Harley 6113). Alternative form &quot;in honorificabilitudinacionibus&quot; is attested from manuscripts in Bamberg (Bamberg State Library, Q.V.41) and Munich (Bavarian State Library, Cgm 541). Other examples include Erfurt O.23, Prague 211 (f. 255v), Bratislava II Q.64 (f. 27r), Pembroke 260 (), and a manuscript of Hoccleve.

The word is also known from at least two inscriptions on medieval tableware. A small goblet inscribed with &quot;honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; around it was found at Kirby Muxloe Castle in Leicestershire, England. A pewter cruet engraved with an abbreviated version of the word (&quot;honorificabiliut&quot;) next to the owner&#x27;s name (Thomas Hunte) was unearthed in a well filled in 1476 during 1937 conservation works at Ashby de la Zouch Castle, also in Leicestershire. The cruet was cast around 1400 and is currently in Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

===Modern===
====Shakespeare&#x27;s times====
The year after the publication of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost&quot; it is used by English satirist Thomas Nashe in his 1599 pamphlet &quot;Nashe&#x27;s Lenten Stuff&quot;:

Nashe is referring to the exotic medicinal plant Guaiacum, the name of which was also exotic to the English at that time, being the first Native American word imported into the English language.

The word also appears in John Marston&#x27;s 1605 play &quot;The Dutch Courtesan&quot;, Act V, Scene II:
In John Fletcher&#x27;s tragicomedy &quot;The Mad Lover&quot; of 1617 the word is used by the palace fool:
John Taylor (&quot;The Water Poet&quot;) uses an even longer version of the word, honorifi&quot;ci&quot;cabilitudinitatibus in the very first sentence of his 1622 pamphlet &quot;Sir Gregory Nonsence&quot;:
====After Shakespeare====
Following the tradition of medieval scholars, Charles du Cange included both &quot;honorificabilitudo&quot; and &quot;honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; in his 1678 Latin lexicon &quot;Glossarium mediae et infimae Latinitatis&quot;, quoting Ugone della Volta and Albertino Mussato.

Thomas Blount listed the anglicized form of the word, &quot;honorificabilitudinity&quot; (defined as &quot;honorableness&quot;), among the 11,000 hard or unusual words in his 1656 &quot;Glossographia&quot;, the largest English dictionary at the time. The entry was quoted by Elisha Coles in &quot;An English Dictionary&quot;, published in 1676. It was also repeated by Nathan Bailey in his influential 1721 &quot;An Universal Etymological English Dictionary&quot;.

While &quot;honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; was not included in Samuel Johnson&#x27;s famous dictionary, Dr Johnson did comment on its length in his 1765 edition of &quot;The Plays of William Shakespeare&quot;:
Commenting on this, antiquarian Joseph Hunter wrote in 1845:
In 1858, Charles Dickens wrote an essay &quot;Calling Bad Names&quot; for the weekly magazine &quot;Household Words&quot; he edited at the time; it starts with the &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; quote and uses it to satirize the scientific publications that use too many Latin words:
James Joyce also used this word in his mammoth 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, during the Scylla and Charybdis episode; when Stephen Dedalus articulates his interpretation of &quot;Hamlet&quot;:
In 1993 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; used the word in its original meaning with reference to a debate about new words&#x27; being used in the game of Scrabble:
In the American animated television series &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;″s 1995 episode &quot;Napoleon Brainaparte&quot;, the word is defined as &quot;with honorablenesses&quot;.

Jeff Noon 2001 book of experimental poetry, &quot;Cobralingus&quot;, used the fictional Cobralingus Engine to remix this word in the style of electronic music to create a prose poem entitled &quot;Pornostatic Processor&quot;.

In the 2005 episode &quot;Sick Days &amp; Spelling&quot; of the Nickelodeon TV show &quot;Ned&#x27;s Declassified School Survival Guide&quot;, Ned Bigby enters the spelling bee, having easy words until he comes across the word &quot;honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; and gives up.

In Suzanne Selfors&#x27; 2011 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Smells Like Treasure&quot;, her spelling champion character, Hercules Simple, uses the word.

<doc id="383912" wikidata="Q7742035" url="?curid=383912" title="The Inheritors (Conrad and Ford novel)">
<text>The Inheritors: An Extravagant Story (1901) is a quasi-science fiction novel on which Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford (writing as Ford M. Heuffer) collaborated. Written before the first World War, its themes of corruption and the effect of the 20th century on British aristocracy were prescient. It was first published in London by William Heinemann and later the same year in New York by McClure, Phillips and Company.

In the novel, the metaphor of the &quot;fourth dimension&quot; is used to explain a societal shift from a generation of people who have traditional values of interdependence, being overtaken by a modern generation who believe in expediency, callously using political power to bring down the old order. Its narrator is an aspiring writer who himself makes a similar transition at a personal level only to feel he has lost everything.

==Plot introduction==
The inheritors are a breed of cold materialists, calling themselves Fourth Dimensionists, whose task is to occupy the earth. Arthur, an unsuccessful English writer, meets a fascinating woman by chance, who seems to talk in metaphors. She claims to be from the Fourth Dimension and a major player in a plan to &quot;inherit the earth&quot;. They go their separate ways with her pledge they will meet again and again.

At their next meeting, the woman freely reveals her &quot;identity&quot; and two others in their circle, one a cabinet minister (Charles Gurnard) and Fox, the editor of a new paper – all of them competing with each other. She has taken on his name and pretends to be his sister, invading firstly his down-on-their-luck aristocratic family by financing improvements to their estate, until she moves with his aunt, to Paris. Each time she turns up, she is in greater connection with prominent political people and appears more dazzlingly beautiful and more desirable to Arthur.

==Plot summary==
The authors introduce the story via science fiction tropes such as the uncanny – coincidences, ESP, unearthly lighting effects, distorted visions, supernatural aural frequencies and scenes dissolving into another – pointing to the underlying threat of instability that drives the novel. The story is told through the eyes of Arthur, a writer turned journalist who feels he is compromising his art. Although Arthur at first holds to high ideals (he values &quot;literature&quot; over journalism, sacrificial literary types over opportunists), he gradually moves away from them because he wants to be a somebody.

After first compromising his work, and obsessed with the woman, he is seduced into thinking that he has a chance with her. He further believes he has a choice between being phased out without making his mark or being &quot;one of them&quot;, one of the inner circle who inherits power along with Them. She accurately chooses him for his weaknesses: his sense of failure and impotence as a writer with a need for significance; his isolation and willingness to join society; his snobbery and openness to flattering attention. While her reasons for bringing Arthur into play are not clear at first, they are complex. Inevitably Arthur is her tool for bringing down her opponent. For the authors, Arthur serves as an observer and an experiment at the hands of the Dimensionists, proving their effectiveness on an individual&#x27;s psyche.

The story is a Machiavellian labyrinth involving the British Government&#x27;s tenuous support for a railway baron, a bid to annex Greenland, and a tilt at party leadership. Themes of unrealised potential, the cold-blooded manoeuvering, and the upward climb of the influential mystery woman, fictionalise the intricacies and interactions of class and power in Britain at the time. Two contrasting mindsets of society are delineated by generational values or lack of them and the changes they portend for the everyday people they effectively rule.

By chance Arthur is offered a job writing &quot;atmospheric&quot; pieces for a new journal put together by an editor (Fox), a well-respected writer (Callan) and the Foreign Minister (Edward Churchill). Although Fox is a Fourth Dimensionist, his group represents the more humanitarian version of the Dimension threesome. Arthur is to write about celebrities. In this way, and through his own sense of superiority and lack of sympathy for others, he is drawn into the machinery of politics and the players who aim to inherit the earth. Although he frequently thinks of ways to expose their plan and tries to warn others such as his aunt and Churchill against the woman and Them, he is outwitted. As her brother, people see it as sibling rivalry, contaminated by jealousy, and ambition. His every move outmatched, Arthur lapses into passivity on that front. Instead he tries to win her favour.

Using the ploy of hinting that she cares, the woman leads Arthur into believing there&#x27;s hope if he can impress her. The ailing and exhausted Fox admits his own defeated position, trusting him with editorial power for a few hours. The climax comes when Arthur has the chance to insert an article that would avert history, to stop the presses at &quot;The Hour&quot;. But with a desire to show how much he is like her kind, to earn her favour, he decides not to. He learns to his dismay that he did just what he was meant to do, undermine Fox – Gurnard&#x27;s opponent – that he never had a place in her scheme, and has betrayed anyone who would have meant anything to him, such as Churchill, Callan and Fox. Learning she is marrying a triumphant Gurnard, realising there is no going back and no future for him, he has a minor breakdown at his Club, where people speak of him as &quot;the one they got at&quot;.

&quot;The Inheritors&quot; contains the themes that preoccupied both its authors in their respective bodies of work. Themes of universality and the corruptibility of human nature, loneliness, isolation, self-deception, and the outworkings of a character&#x27;s flaws are signatures found throughout most of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s writings. In Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s work, both &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; and &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot; published much later, the author depicts a long undisturbed English aristocracy confused and bewildered by the arrival of the 20th century.

<text>The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the two entities composing Bosnia and Herzegovina, the other being Republika Srpska. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of ten autonomous cantons with their own governments and legislatures.

The Federation was created by the 1994 Washington Agreement, which ended the Croat–Bosniak War within the Bosnian War, and established a constituent assembly that continued its work until October 1996.

The Federation has a capital, government, president, parliament, customs and police departments and two postal systems. It occupies about half of the land of Bosnia and Herzegovina. From 1996 until 2005 it had its own army, the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later merged in the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The capital and largest city is Sarajevo with 275,524 inhabitants.

==History==



The basis for the creation of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was laid down by the Washington Agreement of March 1994. Under the agreement, the combined territory held by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council forces was to be divided into ten autonomous cantons along the lines of the Vance-Owen plan. The cantonal system was selected to prevent dominance of one ethnic group over another. However, much of the territory Croats and Bosniaks claimed for their Federation was at that point still controlled by the Bosnian Serbs.

The Washington Agreement was implemented during the spring of 1994, by convoking a Constitutional Assembly, which on 24 June adopted and proclaimed the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In 1995, Bosniak forces and Bosnian Croat forces of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina defeated forces of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, and this territory was added to the federation (Una-Sana Canton).

===Post-war===

By the Dayton Agreement of 1995 that ended the four-year war, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was defined as one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, comprising 51% of country&#x27;s area, alongside Republika Srpska. Cantons and federal structure were built rather slowly after the war. Separatist Croat Herzeg-Bosnia institutions existed and functioned parallel to Federation ones up until 1996–97, when they were phased out. On 8 March 2000, the Brčko District was formed as an autonomous district within Bosnia and Herzegovina and it was created from part of the territory of both Bosnian entities. Brčko District is now a condominium that belongs to both entities.

In 2001–2002, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) imposed amendments to the Federation&#x27;s Constitution and its electoral law, in compliance with the decisions of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the political equality of the three constituent peoples (U-5/98). This triggered the grievances of Bosnian Croats, who claimed they were deprived of their rights to representation as Bosniaks had come to control the majority in the upper house as well.
Dissatisfied Croat politicians set up a separate Croatian National Assembly, held a referendum parallel to the elections and proclaimed their self-rule in Croat-majority areas in the Federation. Their attempts ended shortly after a crackdown by SFOR and legal proceedings.

Dissatisfied with the representation of Croats in the Federation, Croat political parties insist on creating a Croat-majority federal unit instead of several cantons. SDA and other Bosniak parties strongly oppose this. In September 2010, the International Crisis Group warned that &quot;disputes among and between Bosniak and Croat leaders and a dysfunctional administrative system have paralyzed decision-making, put the entity on the verge of bankruptcy and triggered social unrest&quot;. In January 2017, Croatian National Assembly stated that &quot;if Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to become self-sustainable, then it is necessary to have an administrative-territorial reorganization, which would include a federal unit with a Croatian majority. It remains the permanent aspiration of the Croatian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&quot;

In 2010–14 the Federation&#x27;s Government was formed by SDP without the consent of major Croat political parties, leading to a political crisis.

In parallel to EU-facilitated talks on the Sejdic-Finci issue at State level, in February 2013 the US embassy supported an expert working group which presented its 188 recommendations to the FBIH House of Representatives in 2013, aiming to address the costly and complex governance structures with overlapping competences between the Federation, the Cantons and the municipalities as currently entailed in the Federation Constitution. The initiative was finally not adopted by the Parliament.

Following an appeal by HDZ BiH Božo Ljubić, in December 2016 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina abolished the electoral formula for the indirect election of the Federation House of People, stating that it did not guarantee the legitimate representation of constituent peoples. Notably, the ruling did not concur with an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; opinion of the Venice Commission on the same matter. Lacking legislative amendments to revise the Election Law, in Summer 2018 the Central Election Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina provisionally enacted a new formula for the composition of the House of People, based on the minimal representation formula (one deputy per each constituent people per each canton) and on the 2013 census.

In 2022, the High Representative imposed amendments to the federal Constitution and the Election Law, implementing the Ljubic verdict. The changes also reconstructed the original balance of power between Croats and Bosniaks in the Federation, as envisioned in Washington Agreement.

In 2023, the High Representative suspended the federal Constitution for one day in order to impose a new government. This created a huge scandal and political crisis. Some saw this as an act of &quot;treason&quot;.

==Geographic boundary==

The Inter-Entity Boundary Line (IEBL) that distinguishes Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s two entities runs along the frontlines as they existed at the end of the Bosnian War, with adjustments (most importantly in the western part of the country and around Sarajevo), as defined by the Dayton Agreement. The total length of the IEBL is approximately  km. The IEBL is an administrative demarcation and not controlled by the military or police and there is free movement across it.

Five of the cantons (Una-Sana, Tuzla, Zenica-Doboj, Bosnian Podrinje and Sarajevo) are Bosniak-majority cantons, three (Posavina, West Herzegovina and Canton 10) are Croat-majority cantons, and two (Central Bosnia and Herzegovina-Neretva) are &#x27;ethnically mixed&#x27;, meaning there are special legislative procedures for protection of the constituent peoples.

A significant portion of Brčko District was also part of the Federation; however, when the district was created, it became shared territory of both entities, but it was not placed under control of either of the two, and is hence under direct jurisdiction of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Currently the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has 79 municipalities.

==Politics==
The government and politics of the Federation are dominated by three large parties, the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA), the multi-ethnic Social Democratic Party (SDP BiH) and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH).

Entity-level institutions include:
* Federal President with two vice-presidents (list of presidents of FBiH)
* Federal Government with guaranteed ethnic representation (list of prime ministers of FBiH)
* Bicameral Parliament: 
** House of Representatives as the lower house and 
** House of Peoples as the upper house, protecting the interests of the three constituent peoples; 
* Federal Constitutional Court.

Since Bosniaks compose roughly 70.4% of the Federation&#x27;s population, Croats 22.4% and Serbs just around 2%, the Parliament&#x27;s House of Peoples (with equal representation for all three nationalities) is supposed to ensure that the interests of Croats, Serbs and national minorities are fairly represented during government creation and in the legislative process.

The Federation is also divided into ten highly autonomous cantons. They each have their own governments, assemblies and exclusive and shared competencies. In 2010, the Federation&#x27;s Constitutional Court ruled that two Federation&#x27;s ministries – the Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Culture and Sports – are unconstitutional since education and culture are an exclusive competence of the cantons.

===Political divisions===
The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina comprises ten cantons (Bosnian: &quot;kantoni&quot;, Croatian: &quot;županije&quot;):
== Demographics ==

The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina comprises 51% of the land area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is home to 62.85% of the country&#x27;s total population.

<doc id="383925" wikidata="Q685992" url="?curid=383925" title="Hamilton Fish">
<text>Hamilton Fish (August 3, 1808September 7, 1893) was an American statesman who served as the sixteenth governor of New York from 1849 to 1850, a United States senator from New York from 1851 to 1857, and the 26th U.S. secretary of state from 1869 to 1877. Fish was the most trusted advisor to President Ulysses S. Grant and recognized as the pillar of Grant&#x27;s presidency. He is considered one of the nation&#x27;s most effective U.S. secretaries of state by scholars, known for his judiciousness and efforts towards reform and diplomatic moderation. He settled the controversial &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims with the United Kingdom, developing the concept of international arbitration and avoided war with Spain over Cuban independence by coolly handling the volatile &quot;Virginius&quot; incident. He also organized a peace conference and treaty between South American countries and Spain. In 1875, Fish negotiated a reciprocal trade treaty for sugar production with the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i, initiating the process which ended in the 1893 overthrow of the House of Kalākaua and statehood. Fish worked with James Milton Turner to settle the Liberia-Grebo War in 1876.

Fish came from prominence and wealth. His Dutch American family was long-established in New York City. He attended Columbia College and later passed the New York state bar. Initially working as commissioner of deeds, he ran unsuccessfully for New York State Assembly as a Whig candidate in 1834. After marrying, he returned to politics and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1843. Fish ran for New York&#x27;s lieutenant governor in 1846, falling to a Democratic Anti-Rent Party contender. When the office was vacated in 1847, Fish ran and was elected to the position. In 1848, he ran and was elected governor of New York, serving one term. In 1851, he was elected U.S. Senator for New York, serving one term. Fish gained valuable experience serving on Committee on Foreign Relations. Fish was a moderate on the question of maintaining or dissolving slavery; he opposed the Kansas–Nebraska Act and the expansion of slavery.

After traveling to Europe, Fish returned to the United States and supported Abraham Lincoln, the Republican nominee for president in the 1860 U.S. presidential election. During the American Civil War, Fish raised money for the Union war effort and served on Lincoln&#x27;s presidential commission that made successful arrangements for Union and Confederate troop prisoner exchanges. Fish returned to his law practice after the Civil War, and was thought to have retired from political life. When Ulysses S. Grant was elected president in 1868, he appointed Fish as U.S. secretary of state in 1869. Fish took on the State Department with vigor, reorganized the office, and established civil service reform. During his tenure, Fish had to contend with Cuban belligerency, the settlement of the &quot;Alabama&quot; claims, Canada–U.S. border disputes, and the &quot;Virginius&quot; incident. Fish implemented the new concept of international arbitration, where disputes between countries were settled by negotiations, rather than military conflicts. Fish was involved in a political feud between U.S. senator Charles Sumner and President Grant in the latter&#x27;s unsuccessful efforts to annex the Dominican Republic. Fish organized a naval expedition in an unsuccessful attempt to open trade with Korea in 1871. Leaving office and politics in 1877, Fish returned to private life and continued to serve on various historical associations. Fish died quietly of old age in his luxurious New York State home in 1893.

Fish has been praised by historians for his calm demeanor under pressure, honesty, loyalty, modesty, and talented statesmanship during his tenure under President Grant, briefly serving under President Hayes. The hallmark of his career was the Treaty of Washington, peacefully settling the Alabama Claims. Fish also ably handled the &quot;Virginus&quot; incident, keeping the United States out of war with Spain. Fish, while Secretary of State, lacked empathy for the plight of African Americans, and opposed annexation of Latin American countries. Fish has been traditionally viewed to be one of America&#x27;s top ranked Secretaries of State by historians. Fish&#x27;s male descendants would later serve in the U.S. House of Representatives for three generations.

==Early life and education==
Fish was born on August 3, 1808, in what is the present-day Hamilton Fish House in Greenwich Village in New York City, to Nicholas Fish and Elizabeth Stuyvesant, a daughter of Peter Stuyvesant and direct descendant of New Amsterdam&#x27;s Director-General Peter Stuyvesant. He was named after his parents&#x27; friend Alexander Hamilton, a Founding Father and the nation&#x27;s first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under George Washington. Nicholas Fish (1758–1833) was a leading Federalist politician and notable figure of the American Revolutionary War. Colonel Fish was active in the Yorktown Campaign, which featured the final battles of the American Revolutionary War and led to the surrender of Lord Cornwallis and American independence. Peter Stuyvesant was a prominent founder of New York, then a Dutch Colony, and his family owned much property in Manhattan.

Fish received his primary education at M. Bancel, a private school. In 1827, Fish graduated from Columbia College, having obtained high honors. At Columbia, Fish became fluent in French, a language that would later help him as U.S. Secretary of State. After his graduation, Fish studied law for three years in the law office of Peter A. Jay, served as president of the Philolexian Society, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1830, practicing briefly with William Beach Lawrence. Influenced politically by his father, Fish aligned himself to the Whig Party. He served as commissioner of deeds for the city and county of New York from 1831 through 1833, and was an unsuccessful Whig candidate for New York State Assembly in 1834.

On December 15, 1836, Fish married Julia Kean, a sister of Col. John Kean, both descendants of William Livingston, a New Yorker who went on to become New Jersey&#x27;s first governor. The couple&#x27;s lengthy married life was described as happy and Mrs. Fish was known for her &quot;sagacity and judgement.&quot; The couple had three sons and five daughters.

==Career==
===New York political career===
===U.S. Congress===
For eight years after his defeat as a Representative in the New York State Assembly, Fish was reluctant to run for office. However, Whig party leaders in 1842 convinced him to run for the House of Representatives. In November, Fish was elected to the House of Representatives; having defeated Democrat John McKeon and serving in the 28th Congress from New York&#x27;s 6th District between 1843 and 1845. The Whigs at this time were in the minority in the House; however, Fish gained valued national experience serving on the Committee of Military Affairs. Fish failed to win a re-election bid for a second term in the House.

===Lieutenant governor===

Fish was the Whig candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1846, but was defeated by Democrat Addison Gardiner who had been endorsed by the Anti-Rent Party. Leasing farmers in New York refused to pay rent to large land tract owners and sometimes resorted to violence and intimidation. Fish had opposed the Anti-Rent Party for the use of illegal tactics not to pay rent. Gardiner was elected in May 1847 a judge of the New York Court of Appeals and vacated the office of lieutenant governor. Fish was then in November 1847 elected to fill the vacancy, and was Lieutenant Governor in 1848. Lieut. Gov. Fish had a favorable reputation for being &quot;conciliatory&quot; and for his &quot;firmness&quot; over the New York Senate.

===Governor===
In November 1848, he was elected Governor of New York, defeating John A. Dix and Reuben H. Walworth, and served from January 1, 1849, to December 31, 1850. At 40 years of age, Fish was one of the youngest governors to be elected in New York history. Fish advocated and signed into law free public education facilities throughout New York state. He also advocated and signed into law the building of an asylum and school for the intellectually disabled. During his tenure the canal system in the state of New York was increased. In 1850, Fish recommended that the state legislature form a committee to collect and publish the Colonial Laws of New York. None of the bills that Governor Fish vetoed were overturned by the New York legislature. In his annual messages Fish spoke out against the extension of slavery from land acquired from the Mexican–American War, including California and New Mexico. His anti-slavery messages gave Fish national attention and President Zachary Taylor, also a Whig, was going to nominate Fish to the Treasury Department in a cabinet shakeup. However Taylor died in office before he could nominate Fish. Despite his national popularity Fish was not renominated for Governor.

===U.S. Senator===

After Fish retired from office as governor, he did not openly seek the nomination to be elected U.S. Senator. However, Fish&#x27;s supporters, the William H. Seward-Thurlow Weed Whigs, in January 1851 nominated him as a candidate for U.S. Senator. A deadlock ensued over his nomination because one New York legislature Whig Senator was upset about Fish not publicly supporting the Compromise of 1850. Before the election Fish had only stated government should enforce the laws. Although Fish did not favor the spread of slavery he was hesitant to support the free soil movement. Finally, when two Democratic Senators who were against Fish&#x27;s nomination were conspicuously absent, the Senate took action and voted. On March 19, 1851, Fish was elected a U.S. Senator from New York and he took his seat on December 1, serving alongside future Secretary of State William H. Seward.

In the U.S. Senate, he was a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations until the end of his term on March 4, 1857. Fish became friends with President Franklin Pierce&#x27;s Secretary of State William L. Marcy and Attorney General Caleb Cushing. He was a Republican for the latter part of his term and was part of a moderately anti-slavery faction. During the 1850s, the Republican Party replaced the Whig Party as the central party against the Democratic Party. By 1856, Fish privately considered himself a Whig although he knew that the Whig Party was no longer viable politically. Fish was a quiet Senator, rather than an orator, who liked to keep to himself. Fish often was in disagreement with Senator Sumner, who was firmly opposed to slavery and advocated equality for blacks. His policy was to vote for legislation on the side of &quot;justice, economy, and public virtue.&quot; He strongly opposed the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Fish often voted with the Free Soil faction and was strongly against the Kansas-Nebraska Bill. In February 1855, merchants represented by Moses H. Grinnell, criticized Fish&#x27;s bill on immigration and maritime commerce. Fish&#x27;s bill was designed to protect Irish and German immigrants who were dying on merchant ships during oceanic passage to America. The merchants believed that Fish&#x27;s bill was oppressive to commercial interests over human interests.

During his tenure, the nation and Congress were in tremendous political upheaval over slavery, that included violence, disorder, and disturbances of the peace. In 1856, pro-slavery advocates invaded Kansas and used violent tactics against those who were anti-slavery. In May 1856, Senator Charles Sumner was viciously attacked by Preston Brooks in the Senate Chamber. At the expiration of his term, he traveled with his family to Europe and remained there until shortly before the opening of the American Civil War, when he returned to begin actively campaigning for the election of Abraham Lincoln. While in France, Fish studied foreign policy with diplomats and distinguished Americans, and gained valuable experience that would eventually benefit his tenure as U.S. Secretary of State.

===American Civil War===

Fish had several important roles during the American Civil War. Fish&#x27;s private secretary was involved in the attempt of the merchant ship &quot;Star of the West&quot; to bring relief supplies to Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor. During this period, Fish often met with General Winfield Scott, commander-in-chief of the US Army. Fish was dining with Scott in New York when a telegram reported that Confederates had fired on &quot;Star of the West&quot;. Fish said that this meant war; Scott replied &quot;Don&#x27;t utter that word, my friend. You don&#x27;t know what a horrid thing war is.&quot;

In 1861–1862, Fish participated in the Union Defense Committee of the State of New York, which cooperated with New York City in raising and equipping Union Army troops, and disbursed more than $1 million for the relief of New York volunteers and their families. The committee included chairman John A. Dix, William M. Evarts, William E. Dodge, A.T. Stewart, John Jacob Astor, and other New York men. Fish was appointed chairman of the committee after Dix joined the Union Army.

In 1862, President Lincoln appointed Fish and Bishop Edward R. Ames as commissioners to visit Union prisoners in Richmond, Virginia. The Confederate government, however, would not allow them to enter the city. Instead, Fish and Rev. Ames started the prisoner exchange program which continued virtually unchanged throughout the war. After the war ended, Fish went back to private practice as a lawyer in New York.

From 1860 to 1869, Fish was trustee of The Bank for Savings in the City of New-York stepping down from that role when he became US Secretary of State.

===U.S. Secretary of State===

Fish was appointed Secretary of State by President Ulysses S. Grant and served between March 17, 1869, and March 12, 1877. He was President Grant&#x27;s longest-serving Cabinet officer. Upon assuming office in 1869, Fish was initially underrated by some statesmen including former Secretaries of State William H. Seward and John Bigelow. Fish, however, immediately took on the responsibilities of his office with diligence, zeal, and intelligence. Fish&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of State was lengthy, almost eight years, and he had to contend with many foreign policy issues including the Cuban insurrection, the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims, and the Franco-Prussian War.

During Reconstruction, Fish was not known to sympathize with Grant&#x27;s policy to eradicate the Ku Klux Klan, racism in the Southern states, and promote African American equality. Fish complained of being bored at Grant&#x27;s cabinet meetings when Grant&#x27;s U.S. Attorney General Amos T. Akerman told of atrocities of the Klan against black citizens.

====Alabama Claims====

Throughout Fish&#x27;s tenure during Grant&#x27;s first term in office, Fish periodically threatened to resign. After Fish&#x27;s and Grant&#x27;s high-water mark accomplishment of settling the Alabama Claims, Fish told Grant he would resign on August 1, 1871. Grant, however, needed Fish&#x27;s professional advice and pleaded with Fish to remain in office. Grant told Fish he could not replace him. Fish remained in office, 13 years Grant&#x27;s senior, even under ill health.

When Fish assumed office he immediately began a series of reforms in the Department of State. After appropriations were given to his office by Congress, Fish cataloged and organized 700 volumes of miscellaneous State Department documents and created the &quot;Bureau of Indexes and Archives&quot;. Fish introduced indexing of State Department files so subordinates could easily find documents. Fish implemented civil service reform by having State Department applicants be required to pass an entry examination before being appointed consultant. This policy was sometimes hampered, since President Grant could appoint any person to office without the person having to take an examination. However, the policy of testing overall improved the staff at the State Department. Fish&#x27;s methods of organization included disciplined staff and prompt copying of dispatches.

The method of record keeping, however, was cumbersome and had remained unchanged since John Quincy Adams&#x27; presidency. Rather than world regions, countries were listed in alphabetical order; the correspondence was embedded in bound diplomatic and consular category archives, rather than by subject matter. Added to countries&#x27; information was a miscellaneous category filed chronologically. This resulted in a tedious and time-consuming process to make briefings for Congress. Diplomatic ministers, only 23 in 1877, were not kept informed of current world events that took place in other parts of the world.

By 1869, Cuban nationals were in open rebellion against their mother country Spain, due to the unpopularity of Spanish rule. American sentiment favored the Cuban rebels and President Grant appeared to be on the verge of acknowledging Cuban belligerency. Fish, who desired settlement over the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims, did not approve of recognizing the Cuban rebels, since Queen Victoria and her government had recognized Confederate belligerency in 1861. Recognizing Cuban belligerency would have jeopardized settlement and arbitration with Great Britain. In February 1870, Senator John Sherman authored a Senate resolution that would have recognized Cuban belligerency. Working behind the scenes Fish counseled Sherman that Cuban recognition would ultimately lead to war with Spain. The resolution went to the House of Representatives and was ready to pass, however, Fish worked out an agreement with President Grant to send a special message to Congress that urged not to acknowledge the Cuban rebels. On June 13, 1870, the message written by Fish was sent to Congress by the President and Congress, after much debate, decided not to recognize Cuban belligerency. President Grant continued the policy of Cuban belligerent non recognition for the rest of his two administrations. This policy, however, was tested in 1873 with the &quot;Virginius&quot; Affair.

====Annexation of Santo Domingo====


After President Grant assumed office on March 4, 1869, one of his immediate foreign policy interests was the annexation of the Caribbean island nation of the Dominican Republic, at that time referred to as Santo Domingo, to the United States. Grant believed the annexation of Santo Domingo would increase the United States&#x27; mineral resources and alleviate the effects of racism against African Americans in the South. Hamilton Fish, though loyal to Grant, racially opposed annexation of Latin American countries, saying &quot;the incorporation of those peopled by the Latin race would be but the beginnings of years of conflict and anarchy.&quot; The divided island nation, run by mulatto leader President Buenaventura Báez, had been troubled with civil strife. Báez had controversially imprisoned an American citizen, Davis Hatch, for speaking out against the Báez government, susceptible to a Haitian military take over.

Fish told Grant that the U.S. Senate would not be ready to pass a Santo Domingo annexation treaty. In April 1869, Fish gave Grant&#x27;s private secretary Orville Babcock &quot;special agent&quot; status to search the island. Babcock, a military aide, who had served with merit in the Civil War, was a proponent of annexation, and racially open to annexing a Latin American mixed race country, by the United States. In September 1869, Babcock made a preliminary treaty that would annex Santo Domingo to the United States and give it the opportunity to apply for statehood. In October 1869, Fish drew up a formal treaty that included: a $1,500,000 payment of the Dominican national debt; Samaná Bay would be leased to the United States for $150,000 yearly payment; Santo Domingo would eventually be given statehood.

In a private conference with Grant, Fish agreed to support the Santo Domingo annexation if Grant sent Congress a non-belligerency statement not to get involved with the Cuban rebellion against Spain. Charles Sumner, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was against the treaty, believing that Santo Domingo needed to remain independent, and that racism against U.S. black citizens in the South needed to be dealt with in the continental United States. Sumner believed that blacks on Santo Domingo did not share Anglo-American values. On January 10, 1870, Grant submitted the Santo Domingo treaty to the United States Senate. Fish believed senators would vote for annexation only if statehood was withdrawn; however, President Grant refused this option. The Senate took its time deliberating, and finally rejected the treaty on June 30, 1870. Eighteen senators led by Charles Sumner defeated the treaty. Grant, angered at Sumner&#x27;s refusal to support the treaty, fired Sumner&#x27;s friend J. Lothrop Motley, Grant&#x27;s ambassador to England, for disregarding Fish&#x27;s instructions regarding the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims. Grant believed that Sumner had in January 1870 stated his support for the Santo Domingo treaty. Sumner was then deprived of his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1871 by Grant&#x27;s allies in the Senate.

===1870: Colombian inter-oceanic canal treaty===
President Grant and Secretary Fish were interested in establishing an inter-oceanic canal through Panama. Secretary Fish organized a treaty signing on January 26, 1870, in Bogota between the United States and Colombia that established a Panama route for the inter-oceanic canal. The Colombian Senate, however, amended the treaty so much that the strategic value of the inter-oceanic canal construction became ineffective. As a result, the United States Senate refused to ratify the treaty.

===1871: Treaty of Washington===

During the previous administration of President Andrew Johnson, Secretary of State Seward attempted to resolve the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims with the Johnson-Clarendon convention and treaty. The &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims had arisen out of the American Civil War, when Confederate raiding ships built in British ports (most notably the C.S.S. &quot;Alabama&quot;) had sunk a significant number of Union merchant ships. Sumner also stated the Civil War would have ended by 1863 if the British weren&#x27;t complicit in allowing its blockade runners to smuggle hundreds of thousands of weapons through the Union blockade to the Confederacy. As such, Sumner demanded that Britain pay $2 billion or simply cede Canada to the United States for the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims.

The Johnson-Clarendon treaty, presented to Congress by President Ulysses S. Grant, was overwhelmingly defeated by the Senate and the claims remained unresolved. Anglophobia led by Charles Sumner was at an all-time high when Fish became Secretary of State. In late 1870, an opportunity arrived to settle the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims under Prime Minister William Gladstone. Fish, who was determined to improve relations with Britain, along with President Grant and Senate supporters, had Charles Sumner removed by vote from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the door was open for renewed negotiations with Britain.

On January 9, 1871, Fish met with British representative Sir John Rose in Washington and an agreement was made, after much negotiation, to establish a Joint Commission to settle the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims to be held in Washington under the direction of Hamilton Fish. At stake was the financing of America&#x27;s debt with British bankers during the Civil War, and peace with Britain was required. On February 14, 1871, both distinguished High Commissioners representing Britain, led by the Earl of Ripon, George Robinson, and the United States, led by Fish, met in Washington, D.C., and negotiations over settlement went remarkably well. Also representing Britain was Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. After 37 meetings, on May 8, 1871, the Treaty of Washington was signed at the State Department and became a &quot;landmark of international conciliation&quot;. The Senate ratified the treaty on May 24, 1871. On August 25, 1872, the settlement for the &quot;Alabama&quot; claims was made by an international arbitration committee meeting in Geneva and the United States was awarded $15,500,000 (~$ in ) in gold only for damage done by the Confederate warships. Under the treaty settlement over disputed Atlantic fisheries and the San Juan Boundary (concerning the Oregon boundary line) was made. The treaty was considered an &quot;unprecedented accomplishment&quot;, having solved border disputes, reciprocal trade, and navigation issues. A friendly perpetual relationship between Great Britain and America was established, with Britain having expressed regret over the &quot;Alabama&quot; damages.

===1871: South American détente and armistice===

On April 11, 1871, a peace-trade conference, presided over by Hamilton Fish, was held in Washington D.C., between Spain and the South American republics of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia, which resulted in an armistice between the countries. These countries had been in a &quot;technical&quot; state of war since 1866, and the United States in 1871 served as mediator under the direction of Hamilton Fish. Representing Spain was Mauricio Lopez Roberts; Manuel Freyer represented both Peru and Bolivia; Joaquín Godoy represented Chile; and Antonio Flores represented Ecuador. President Grant gave Fish full powers to control negotiations at the détente meeting between the five countries. The signed armistice treaty consisted of seven articles; hostilities were to cease for a minimum of three years and the countries would allow commercial trade with neutral countries.

===1871: Korean expedition and conflict===
In 1871, Korea was known as the &quot;Hermit Kingdom&quot;, a country determined to remain isolated from other nations, specifically from commerce and trade from Western nations, including the United States. In 1866, U.S. relations with Korea were troubled when Christian missionaries were beheaded by the Korean &quot;Daewongun&quot;, regent to King Kojong, and the crew of the &quot;General Sherman&quot;, a U.S. trading ship, were massacred. Secretary Seward, under President Johnson, demanded redress for what was perceived as the outrageous actions of the Korean government. U.S. Naval warships were ordered to the Orient, however, when Seward&#x27;s term ended in 1869, he was unable to organize a naval expedition. When Fish took office, he organized the Korean naval expedition and broadened the purposes. In April 1871, Fish ordered Frederick F. Low, minister to China, to take the Asiatic Fleet and voyage to Seoul. The purpose of the expedition was to seek retribution for the assaulted sailors and to open up a commercial treaty with the King of Korea. Fish had told the fleet not to use force unless the honor of the U.S. flag was infringed by the Koreans.

On May 8, 1871, Low and Rear Admiral John Rodgers, commander of the Asiatic Squadron, voyaged to Korea with five warships, 85 guns, and 1,230 sailors and marines. On May 16, the naval squadron reached Nagasaki Bay, and a week later lowered anchor near the mouth of the Han River. The Koreans sent unofficial representatives to stall for time and hope the American squadron would leave. In June, the American fleet was performing a nautical survey and was fired upon by the Korean forts on the Han River leading to Seoul. The American fleet fired back, damaging the forts. The Americans demanded an apology on the grounds that the honor of the American flag had been violated. On June 10, a U.S. military expedition was launched after the Koreans failed to apologize for the attack; the objective was to destroy the Korean forts on Ganghwa Island. The U.S.S. &quot;Monocacy&quot; pounded the forts with 9 inch guns while 546 sailors and 105 marines landed on the island and captured and destroyed the Korean forts. The &quot;Citadel&quot; fortress, on a steep 115-foot hillside, put up the stiffest resistance to the American troops, who fought in hand-to-hand combat with the Korean Tiger Hunters. All of the Korean forts taken were destroyed and leveled on June 11. Three hundred fifty Korean Tiger Hunters were killed, compared with only one American officer and two American sailors. Lieut. Hugh W. McKee was the first U.S. Navy officer to die in battle in Korea.

The Asiatic Squadron remained on the Han River for three weeks, but the Koreans would not open negotiations for a commercial treaty. As the American squadron left, the Koreans believed that they had won a great victory over the Americans. The attempt to open Korea up to trade was similar to how Commodore Matthew Perry in 1854 had approached the opening of Japan. Korea, however, proved to be more isolated than Japan. In 1881, Commodore Robert W. Shufeldt, without using a naval fleet, went to a more conciliatory Korean government and made a commercial treaty. The U.S. was the first Western nation to establish formal trade with Korea.

===1873: &quot;Virginius&quot; affair===
During the 1870s, Cuba was in a state of rebellion against Spain. In the United States, Americans were divided on whether to militarily aid the rebel Cubans. Many jingoists believed the United States needed to fight for the Cuban rebels and pressured the Grant Administration to take action. A privately owned ship, the &quot;Virginius&quot;, was used to run guns, ammunition, and vital supplies to the Cuban rebels. The captain of the &quot;Virginius&quot; was Joseph Fry, former officer of the Confederate and Federal Navies. On October 31, 1873, the &quot;Virginius&quot; was run down in neutral waters by the Spanish warship, the Tornado, off of Morant Bay, Jamaica. After being hit, the &quot;Virginius&quot; took on water and was forced to surrender to the Spanish authorities. The 103 crew members consisted of Cuban rebel recruits and 52 American and British citizens. The Spanish hauled down and trampled the American flag, and brought the prisoners to Santiago. A total of 53 &quot;Virginius&quot; crew members were executed by the Spanish authorities. The Spanish finally stopped the carnage as a British warship appeared with guns ready to fire on Santiago. The American Navy, at this time, although formidable worldwide, was in decline after the American Civil War.

When news reached the United States of the executions, President Grant and Secretary Fish were forced to make an immediate response. Many Americans demanded a full-scale war with Spain. Fish found out that the registration was falsified under American ownership, however, the executions of Americans demanded action. Fish coolly handled the situation, calling upon Spanish minister, Admiral José Polo de Bernabé in Washington D.C., and holding a conference. A settlement was made where Spain relinquished the severely damaged &quot;Virginius&quot; to the U.S. Navy, while survivors were released that included 13 Americans. The Spanish Captain who ordered the executions was censured, and Spain paid $80,000 reparations to American families whose family members were executed in Santiago. The national honor of both Spain and the United States was preserved and it was chiefly due to the restraint and moderation of Fish and Bernabé that a satisfactory settlement of the &quot;Virginius&quot; Affair was reached by the United States and Spain.

===1875: Hawaiian reciprocal trade treaty===
Fish also negotiated the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 with the Hawaiian Kingdom under the reign of King Kalākaua. Hawaiian sugar was made duty-free, while the importation of manufactured goods and clothing was allowed into the island kingdom. By opening Hawaii to free trade the process for annexation and eventual statehood into the United States had begun.

===1876: Liberian-Grebo War===

The U.S. settled the Liberian-Grebo War in 1876 when Hamilton Fish dispatched the USS &quot;Alaska&quot;, under President Grant&#x27;s authority, to Liberia. Liberia was in practice an American colony. U.S. envoy James Milton Turner, the first African American ambassador, requested a warship to protect American property in Liberia. Turner, bolstered by U.S. naval presence in harbor and support of the USS &quot;Alaska&quot; captain, negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia.

===1876: Republican convention===
As the 1876 Republican convention approached during the U.S. presidential election, President Grant, unknown to Fish, had written a letter to Republican leaders to nominate Fish for the Presidential ticket. The letter was never read at the convention and Fish was never nominated. President Grant believed that Fish was a good compromise choice between the rival factions of James G. Blaine and Roscoe Conkling. Cartoonist Thomas Nast drew a caricature of Fish and Rutherford B. Hayes as the Republican Party ticket. Fish, who was ready to retire to private life, did not desire to run for president and was content at returning to private life. Fish found out later that President Grant had written the letter to the convention.

===1877: Nicaragua inter-oceanic canal negotiations===
President Grant at the close of his second term, and Secretary Fish, remained interested in establishing an inter-oceanic canal treaty. Fish and the State Department negotiated with a special envoy from Nicaragua in February 1877 for an inter-oceanic treaty. Negotiations, however, failed as the status of the neutral zone could not be established.

==Later life and health==

After leaving the Grant Cabinet in 1877 and briefly serving under President Hayes, Fish retired from public office and returned to private life practicing law and managing his real estate in New York City. Fish was revered in the New York community and enjoyed spending time with his family.

Fish resided in Glen Clyffe, his estate near Garrison, New York, in Putnam County, New York, in the Hudson River Valley. His health remained good until around 1884, having suffered from neuralgia.

===Death, funeral, and burial===
On September 6, 1893, Fish had retired from the evening having played cards with his daughter. The following morning on September 7, Fish, at the age of 85, suddenly died. His death was attributed to advanced age.

On September 11, 1893, Fish was buried in Garrison at St. Philip&#x27;s Church in the Highlands Cemetery under waving trees on the hills along the Hudson River shoreline. He was buried next to his wife and oldest daughter near the grave of Edwards Pierrepont, President Grant&#x27;s U.S. Attorney General. Many notable persons attended Fish&#x27;s funeral, and Bishop Potter conducted services. Julia Grant, widowed wife of Grant, attended Fish&#x27;s funeral.

==Historical reputation==

Charles Francis Adams described Fish as &quot;a quiet and easy-going man; but, when aroused, by being, as he thought, &#x27;put upon&#x27;, he became very formidable. Neither was it possible to placate him.&quot; Fish&#x27;s 20th Century biographer, A. Elwood Corning, stated that Fish was free from &quot;petty jealousies and prejudices which so often drag the reputation of statesmen down to the level of politicians&quot; and that Fish &quot;used the language and practiced the manners of a gentleman.&quot; As an invaluable member of the Grant Administration, Fish commanded &quot;men&#x27;s confidence, and respect by his firmness, candor, and justice.&quot;

A survey of scholars in the December 1981 &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine ranked Fish third on a list of top ten Secretaries of State, noting his settlement of the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims in 1871, his settlement of the &quot;Virginius&quot; Incident, and his role in the Hawaiian treaty ratified by the Senate in 1875.

There is a memorial to Fish at the Cathedral of All Saints in Albany, New York. The Hamilton Fish Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, which spans the Hudson River 50 miles north of New York City between Dutchess and Orange counties, is named after Fish. A street in the Bronx, New York, is named after Fish, as is Hamilton Fish Park in Manhattan.

Fish was a long time member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati by right of his father&#x27;s service as an officer in the Continental Army. Fish succeeded to his father&#x27;s seat in the Society in 1834, following his father&#x27;s death the previous year. In 1848, Fish became the Vice President General of the national society and, in 1854, he became its president general. In 1855, Fish was elected president of the New York Society. Fish served as both president general of the national society and president of the New York Society until his death in 1893.

==Notable descendants==
Three of Fish&#x27;s direct descendants, all named Hamilton, served in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing New York state. Hamilton Fish II, Fish&#x27;s son, served one term as U.S. Representative from 1909 to 1911. Fish II also served as assistant to his father at the U.S. State Department.

Hamilton Fish III, Fish&#x27;s grandson, served as U.S. Representative from 1920 to 1945. Hamilton Fish IV, Fish&#x27;s great-grandson, served as U.S. Representative from 1969 to 1995. Another son Stuyvesant Fish was an important railroad executive. Another son, Nicholas Fish II, was a U.S. diplomat, who was appointed second secretary of legation at Berlin in 1871, became secretary in 1874, and was chargé d&#x27;affaires at Berne in 1877–1881, and minister to Belgium in 1882–1886, after which he engaged in banking in New York City. Hamilton Fish, Fish&#x27;s grandson by Nicholas, was an 1895 graduate of Columbia College, saw service in the Spanish–American War as one of the storied Rough Riders. He was the first member of that regiment to be killed in action, at the Battle of Las Guasimas, Cuba.

His great nephew Thomas Kean was New Jersey governor from 1982 until 1990 and chairman of the 9/11 Commission following the September 11, 2001 attacks.

<text>Timothy Simon Roth (; born 14 May 1961) is an English actor and director. He was among a group of prominent British actors known as the &quot;Brit Pack&quot;.

Roth was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer in his film debut &quot;The Hit&quot; (1984). Since then, he gained more attention for his roles in films, including &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot; (1989), and &quot;Vincent &amp; Theo&quot; and &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; (both 1990). Roth has collaborated with Quentin Tarantino on several films, including &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992), &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), &quot;Four Rooms&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; (2015). For his performance in &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1995), Roth won a BAFTA Award, and was nominated for the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award. 

Roth made his directorial debut with the film &quot;The War Zone&quot; (1999). He played Cal Lightman in the Fox series &quot;Lie to Me&quot; (2009–2011) and Jim Worth/Jack Devlin in the Sky Atlantic series &quot;Tin Star&quot; (2017–2020). In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Roth portrayed Emil Blonsky / The Abomination in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008), &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021), and the Disney+ series &quot;She-Hulk: Attorney at Law&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Roth was born on 14 May 1961 in Dulwich, London. His mother, Ann, was a painter and teacher. His father, Ernie, was a Fleet Street journalist and painter. His father was born in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, to a family of Irish descent. Although he was not of Jewish background, his father changed his surname from &quot;Smith&quot; to the German/Yiddish &quot;Roth&quot; in the 1940s, as &quot;an act of anti-Nazi solidarity&quot;. Roth&#x27;s father was a World War II veteran. 

Roth is a survivor of child sexual abuse, committed by his paternal grandfather, whom he has stated sexually abused him from childhood until his early teen years. He first revealed that he was a victim of sexual abuse during press for the 1999 film &quot;The War Zone&quot;, which dealt with the topics of incest and sexual violence within a family, but declined to name the perpetrator at that time. In December 2016, he gave an interview to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in which he said that his abuser was his grandfather, who had also abused his father when he was a child.

Roth attended school in Lambeth before moving to Croydon Technical School, due to bullying. He attended the Strand School in Tulse Hill. Roth wanted to be a sculptor and studied at London&#x27;s Camberwell College of Arts.

=== Political Views ===
As of 2008, Roth was a supporter of the Green Party of England and Wales. Roth protested against the Iraq War and later criticised former Prime Minister Tony Blair for his involvement, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt Blair should be hauled off in handcuffs and put in Wormwood Scrubs. I think he’s profited from the death of Reg’s son and the Iraq war. I think that’s where he belongs... I have nothing but contempt for him&quot;.

He endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 United States presidential election. Roth was critical of Donald Trump&#x27;s victory in 2016, saying: &quot;I hate Trump. I hate everything that he stands for.&quot;
